The '''A616''' is a road that links [[Newark-on-Trent]], [[Nottinghamshire]], to the [[M1 motorway]] at Junction 30, then reappears at Junction 35A and goes on to [[Huddersfield]], [[West Yorkshire]].

The road originally ran continuously from Newark to Huddersfield, via [[Sheffield]] city centre. The section of route between the M1 Junction 30 and Sheffield was re-numbered A6135, and the route north-west of Sheffield largely renumbered the A6102.

==Route==
===Newark to Barlborough===
Similar to the [[A57 road|A57]], this section of the road is used to connect traffic heading to and from [[West Yorkshire|West]] and [[South Yorkshire]] with routes for the A1 to the south-east. The advantages of the A616 are that it is less well known than the A57 as a through-route and does not pass through large centres of population.

It starts in the south at the busy roundabout with the A617 and [[A46 road|A46]] (Newark bypass), known as the Cattle Market Island. This is the third position of its southern terminus. When the A1 ran through Newark, before July 1964, it met the A1 further towards [[Newark Castle railway station]], by continuing from its present route down Debdale Hill then through [[Kelham]], where it met the A617, and along the present-day A617 near what is the present-day [[Trent Valley Way]]. After the A1 bypass was built, the A1 through Newark became the A6065, and the former A616 became an unclassified road from Toll Bar Farm to Kelham, and the A617 from Kelham to Newark. The A616 then followed a former unclassified road to South Muskham, where it met the A6065. When the Newark Bypass was built in 1989, the A6065 was removed and the A616 extended from South Muskham to Newark along the former A6065.

[[File:A616 Avenue - geograph.org.uk - 134859.jpg|thumb|left|Towards Newark]]
The former A1 into Newark from the roundabout is the B6326. For just under two miles it follows the former A1 north to [[South Muskham]], passing a large [[British Sugar]] sugar beet processing [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1678848 plant] on the right. This is now one of the main sugar beet factories left, as many in the region have closed. It runs parallel to the [[East Coast Main Line]], which can be seen to the east. On the former Great North Road, it passes over a [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2533436 causeway] built in 1770 by [[John Smeaton]]. At [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/74865 Muskham Bridge] it crosses the [[River Trent]]. At South Muskham the road [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/134859 leaves] to the west with the northern former A1 continuing as the B6325. It passes through Little Carlton, part of South Muskham parish. It climbs Debdale Hill and meets a road from [[Kelham]], to the left. It passes Debdale Hill Farm as ''Ollerton Road''. Over the brow of the hill, it enters Caunton parish, where the road has been straightened, leaving lay-bys on both sides of the road. It passes [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1700615 Dean Hall Farm] and there is a crossroads for [[Knapthorpe]] to the left and [[Caunton]] to the right. There is a left turn for [[Maplebeck]] near Beesthorpe Hall, and a right turn from Caunton.

It passes Buckshaw Farm, then a straightened bend with a layby on the right, and then through Kneesall, passing the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/53826 church] of St Bartholomew and the ''[http://www.angelinnkneesall.com Angel Inn]''. It is [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/264953 crossed] by a 400&amp;nbsp;kV pylon line and [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/508008 passes] through the small village of [[Ompton]]. It climbs Grimston Hill, entering the parish of [[Wellow, Nottinghamshire|Wellow]]. It [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/508009 passes] through Wellow, meeting a road from the left from [[Eakring]], and [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/118130 passing] the ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120407041859/http://www.diningpubs.co.uk/pub_details.asp?id=193 Durham Ox]''. There is an angled crossroads for [[Rufford, Nottinghamshire|Rufford]] (and the Sherwood Castle Holiday Forest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sherwoodcastle.co.uk Sherwood Castle]&lt;/ref&gt;) to the left and [[Ollerton and Boughton|New Ollerton]] to the right, and the road passes of a former railway. It enters Ollerton, crossing a railway. There is a roundabout with the A6075, to the left for New Ollerton, with which the road overlaps for a half-mile to the west. The B6461 is to the left, and the road crosses the [[River Maun]]. There is a [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/713902 roundabout] at Sherwood Heath with the north-south A614 and the A6075 to the south-west for [[Thoresby Colliery]] and [[Edwinstowe]], at which there is the ''[[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] Ollerton'' garage, a fish and chip restaurant, and the [[Texaco]] ''Ollerton Star Service Station''.

It [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1202228 passes] through what is [[Sherwood Forest]] at Bilhaugh in Edwinstowe parish, and meets ''Swincote Road'' (B6034) to the left, from Edwinstowe, and overlaps with the road. In [[Perlethorpe cum Budby]], it passes through [[Budby]] as ''Worksop Road'' and [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/773553 crosses] the [[River Meden]] to the west of Thoresby Lake. At Budby North Forest the A6034 leaves to the right (the north), and slightly further north is a crossroads with ''Netherfield lane''. At Hazel Gap the road continues due west and is crossed by the [[Robin Hood Way]] near [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2591383 Hazel Gap Farm] in the parish of [[Norton, Nottinghamshire|Norton]]. The road enters [[Bassetlaw]] and passes along the northern edge of Gleadthorpe Breck Plantation and Hatfield Plantation, north of [[Welbeck Colliery]]. There is a right turn for Norton and the road meets the north-south [[A60 road|A60]] at [[Cuckney]], where the [[A632 road|A632]] leaves for [[Bolsover]] to the south-west. In the village the road [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1924055 passes] the ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20111113204814/http://www.thegreendaleoak.co.uk/ Greendale Oak]''. It [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1045779 leaves] to the west as ''Creswell Road'', crossing the [[River Poulter]].

[[File:Treble Bob - geograph.org.uk - 936530.jpg|thumb|left|''Treble Bob'' at [[Barlborough]] ]]
It passes Woodend Farm and there is a crossroads for Whaley and [[Holbeck, Nottinghamshire|Holbeck]]. The [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1382551 road] enters [[Derbyshire]] and the district of [[Bolsover (district)|Bolsover]], south of Creswell. Entering the (former mining) village of Creswell it meets the B6042 to the right, for [[Creswell Crags]], a limestone gorge. There is a left [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/113072 turn] for ''Elmton Road'', for the [[model village]]. There is a height indicator [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/724557 across] the road with dangling chains for the approaching [[Robin Hood Line|railway]] [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/117697 bridge] which has a height of 4.1 metres. Towards Clowne the road follows to the north of a disused railway, and passes the Creswell Campus of [[Chesterfield College]], before crossroads, for [[Elmton]] to the left. Entering [[Clowne]] there is a [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1583926 crossroads] where it is crossed by the [[Archaeological Way]]. It passes the [[Jet (brand)|JET]] ''Woodall Garage'', and meets the B6418 from the left and the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2428811 terminus] of the A618, ''[[Rotherham]] Road'' for [[Killamarsh]], to the right. It leaves as ''Barlborough Road'', passing through New Barlsborough. The road used to pass through [[Barlborough]], but now passes to the south. The [[Crown Carveries]] ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110929200540/http://www.crowncarveries.co.uk/find-us/Thederodesarms.html De Rodes Arms]'' is on the former roundabout with the A619. It leaves the former route to the left at a roundabout, and there is a roundabout for the [[Dobbies Garden Centres|Dobbies garden centre]] and Barlborough Links Golf Club, and another for the Barlborough Links retail park and a large [[Tesco]] distribution centre on Barlborough Common. There is a roundabout with the earlier route around Barlborough, where it meets the east-west A619. At this roundabout is the [[Hotel Ibis|Ibis]] [http://www.ibishotel.com/gb/hotel-3157-ibis-chesterfield-north/location.shtml Chesterfield North] [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/572861 hotel] and the ''[http://www.pub-explorer.com/derbyshire/pub/treblebobbarlborough.htm Treble Bob]'' pub-restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatbritishcarvery.co.uk/our-pubs/treble-bob Great British Carvery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913155010/http://www.greatbritishcarvery.co.uk/our-pubs/treble-bob |date=13 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing the earlier diversion around Barlborough, built at the time of the M1 in 1967, it meets the M1 at [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2431201 junction 30], where it continues into Sheffield as the A6135. The route was renumbered when junction 35A of the M1 was built.

===Tankersley to Huddersfield===
The northern section resumes at the end of the slip roads of junction 35A of the M1 at [[Tankersley, South Yorkshire|Tankersley]], at a roundabout for Warren and a business park. To the north is [[Tankersley Hall]], which featured in the film ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]''. At this point it is the boundary between the boroughs of Sheffield (to the south), and Barnsley (to the north), with the road in the borough of Barnsley. To the right is a turn off for Tankersley Park golf club. It skirts the north of New Biggin Plantation and [[Westwood Country Park]], and is [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/898486 crossed] by the [[Barnsley Boundary Walk]], and the [[Trans Pennine Trail]]. At Upper Tankersley there is a busy roundabout with ''Westwood New Road'' ([[A61 road|A61]]) at the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] ''Wentworth Park Service Station'', and to the north is the Wentworth Industrial Park. There is a [[Premier Inn]] on the right,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premierinn.com/en/hotel/BARWEN/sheffield/barnsley-m1-jct36 Sheffield-Barnsley Premier Inn]&lt;/ref&gt; next door to one of Britain's seven [[Taybarns]] pubs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taybarns.com/home/location-finder/restaurants/barnsley Taybarns Barnsley] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309024308/http://www.taybarns.com/home/location-finder/restaurants/barnsley |date=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From here the Sheffield-Barnsley boundary follows the A61 southwards to the A629 junction. It crosses the Storrs Dike near [[Bromley, South Yorkshire|Bromley]]. It skirts the south of Copley Wood, and at [[Wortley, South Yorkshire|Wortley]] [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1952211 meets] the A629 at a grade separated junction – one of two junctions of this type along the road. ''Woodhead Road'', for [[Wadsley Bridge]], also joins from the south. Near [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2063466 Gosling Moor Farm], it is crossed by the Trans Pennine Trail and a former railway.

[[File:View_towards_Langsett_along_the_A616_Stocksbridge_Bypass_-_geograph.org.uk_-_916607.jpg|thumb|left|Stocksbridge bypass]]
It crosses the [[River Don, South Yorkshire|River Don]] where it enters the borough of Sheffield. There is a grade-separated junction with the A6102, for Sheffield and the former route, which is the eastern end of the Stocksbridge bypass. The former route through Stocksbridge is the B6088. It passes along the northern edge of Stocksbridge on an escarpment overlooking the town. A 400&amp;nbsp;kV pylon line [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/916607 follows] the road. The road, a downgraded M67, is a [[2+1 road]]. This is not adequate for the quantity of traffic it carries, and would have been originally designed as a dual-carriageway as it is a well-engineered road. It passes [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/916499 Wellhouse Farm] and is crossed by ''Pearoyd Lane'', where it [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/916493 overlooks] the [[Samuel Fox and Company|former steelworks]] to the south. It passes [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1321759 Cote House Farm], and meets the former route, the B6088, from the left which is the western end of the Stocksbridge bypass, and the end of the upgraded section from the M1. At this point the road re-enters the borough of Barnsley, and the Sheffield-Barnsley boundary follows the southern edge of the road all the way to Langsett.

[[File:The new Flouch roundabout, A628 - A616, Langsett - geograph.org.uk - 936961.jpg|thumb|right|Flouch Roundabout with the A628, looking east]]
[[Underbank Reservoir]] is to the south, and Sheephouse Wood is to the north, with the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/921303 entrance] to [[Fox Wire]] on the right. At [[Midhopestones]] there is a [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/58285 crossroads], with the left turn for the ''Ye Olde Mustard Pot'' pub. The road follows the valley of the [[Little Don River]], where it is followed by the Barnsley Boundary Walk. At Langsett there is a left turn for [[Upper Midhope]], and a right turn, and passes the ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1023936 Bank View Cafe]''. To the south is [[Langsett Reservoir]] and the road skirts the eastern edge of Crookland Wood. It meets the A628 at the ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/936961 Flouch Roundabout]''. Traffic for Manchester from the M1 follows the [[A628 road|A628]] to the west – the [[Longdendale|Woodhead Pass]]. To the north, the road is untrunked all the way to Huddersfield, and passes the ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/18970 Flouch Hotel]'' next to the former [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/931367 mini-roundabout]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Flouch_Inn Flouch Inn]&lt;/ref&gt; with the A628.

[[File:The A616, Dunford - geograph.org.uk - 936968.jpg|thumb|left|The A616 at [[Dunford, South Yorkshire|Dunford]] is an exposed section.]]
It continues as the straight ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/936968 Whams Road]'' across Thurlstone Moors, passing through Hazlehead, in Dunford, where it is [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/936974 crossed] by the former Woodhead Line, next to the former [[Hazlehead Bridge railway station]]. The [[Woodhead Tunnel]] begins around two miles to the west at [[Dunford Bridge]]. The Woodhead Line is now the Trans Pennine Trail. From Langsett to the TPT bridge, the A616 is the boundary of the [[Peak District National Park]]. It crosses the River Don, and there are crossroads with the B6106. At [[Crow Edge]], it passes the Hepworth pipe works, now owned by [[Wavin]] (a Dutch company), and the ''Prince of Wales Hotel'' on the right. At Victoria there are crossroads at the ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1976290 Victoria Inn]'', where the road enters [[Kirklees]], and [[West Yorkshire]]. The road becomes more twisty, and passes through [[Hepworth, West Yorkshire|Hepworth]] and [[Scholes, Holme Valley|Scholes]], where it is crossed by the [[Kirklees Way]].

It crosses the [[A635 road|A635]] at [[New Mill, West Yorkshire|New Mill]]. It passes through [[Thongsbridge]] and meets the [[Holme Valley]] at [[Brockholes]] as ''New Mill Road'', and passes [[Brockholes railway station]], and the [[Esso]] ''Midlothian Garage'' and the [[Jet (brand)|JET]] ''Johnsted Garage''. There is a crossroads, with the left turn for Honley and the right turn for [[Honley railway station]] and [[Honley High School]]. It meets the A6024 from the left and as ''Huddersfield Road'' passes the [[Texaco]] ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1922318 Alpine Service Station]'', then becomes ''Woodhead Road''. Entering Huddersfield, there is a crossroads with the left for ''Armitage Road'' (B6110 for [[Meltham]]) and the right for [[Berry Brow]] and its railway station. It [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1822755 passes] under the [[Penistone Line]] and becomes ''Bridge Street'', where it crosses the River Holme, meeting ''Meltham Road'' (B6108). As ''[[Lockwood, West Yorkshire|Lockwood]] Road'' it passes the ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/852107 Yorkshire Victoria]'', and meets ''St Thomas Road'' (B6432) then as ''Folly Hall'' crosses the [[River Colne, West Yorkshire|River Colne]], and meets ''Colne Road'' (B6432) from the right. As ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1454146 Chapel Hill]'' it meets ''Manchester Road'' (A62) from the left, where it terminates on the A62 Huddersfield ring road.

==Stocksbridge bypass==
The bypass was opened in May 1988 and is a road that links the [[M1 motorway]] at Junction 35A (and J36) to the [[Longdendale|Woodhead Pass]] (one of the main trans-[[Pennines|Pennine]] roads from Sheffield to [[Manchester]]) bypassing the towns of [[Stocksbridge]] and [[Deepcar]]. It has been said that the Stocksbridge bypass was originally planned to be part of the [[M67 motorway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pathetic.org.uk/unbuilt/m67_manchester_to_sheffield_motorway/ Pathetic Motorways]&lt;/ref&gt;

The speed limit on the A616 is enforced using a digital [[speed camera]] system called [[SPECS (speed camera)|SPECS]], which calculates the average speed of a vehicle over the distance travelled between two cameras using [[automatic number plate recognition]] (ANPR) technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southyorkshire.police.uk/foi/disclosurelog/20090151syscp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301001626/http://southyorkshire.police.uk/foi/disclosurelog/20090151syscp |date=1 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of speed cameras is thought by locals not to be in current use, but nonetheless acts as a strong deterrent against speeding. There are frequent head-on collisions on the bypass.

There are several ghost stories attached to the Stocksbridge Bypass, including reputed apparitions of a monk and phantom children during the road's construction. These claims were featured in a 1994 episode of the paranormal documentary series ''[[Strange but True?]]'', hosted by [[Michael Aspel]].

The '''African manatee''' (''Trichechus senegalensis''), also known as the '''West African manatee''' or '''sea cow''', is a [[species]] of [[manatee]] that is mostly [[herbivore|herbivorous]]. African manatees inhabit much of the western region of Africa – from [[Senegal]] to [[Angola]].&lt;ref name="SeaWorld"&gt;{{cite web | title = Manatee | publisher = Sea World | date = December 30, 2011 | url = http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/sirenia/manatees.htm | accessdate = December 30, 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120118065736/http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/sirenia/manatees.htm | archivedate = January 18, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although scientists do not know a great deal about this [[species]], they hypothesize that the African manatee is very similar to the [[West Indian manatee]] (''Trichechus manatus'').&lt;ref name="AnimalCorner"&gt;{{cite web|title = West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis)|publisher = Animal Corner|year = 2012|url = http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/marine/manatees/manatee_westafrican.html|accessdate = January 5, 2011|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101120033433/http://animalcorner.co.uk/marine/manatees/manatee_westafrican.html|archivedate = November 20, 2010|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The African manatee was officially declared a species under the ''Trichechus senegalensis'' [[taxon]] in 1795 by naturalist [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link]]. No [[subspecies]] of this taxon are known. Although African manatees live in both coastal areas and isolated inland areas, genetic evidence suggests no significant differences between the two populations.&lt;ref name ="IUCN"&gt;{{IUCN | last = Powell| first = J.| last2 =  Kouadio| first2 = A.| title = ''Trichechus senegalensis''| publisher =  IUCN Red List| year = 2008|version=2011.2|id = 22104|accessdate = November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The African manatee falls under the [[genus]] ''Trichechus'' with only two other [[species]], the [[Amazonian manatee]] and the [[West Indian manatee]], which are also [[sirenians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Husar| first = Sandra L.| title = ''Trichechus senegalensis''| journal = Mammalian Species| volume = 89| pages = 1| publisher = The American Society of Mammalogists| date = 6 January 1978| version = 2011.2| url = http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-089-01-0001.pdf| accessdate = November 13, 2011| doi = 10.2307/3503790| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140521031251/http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-089-01-0001.pdf| archivedate = 21 May 2014| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range and habitat==
African manatees can be found in West African regions: [[Angola]], [[Benin]], [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], [[The Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Togo]]. Manatees are found in [[Brackish water|brackish]] waters to freshwater: in oceans, rivers, lakes, coastal estuaries, reservoirs, lagoons, and bays on the coast.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt; African manatees rarely inhabit waters with a temperature below {{nowrap|18°C (64°F).&lt;ref name="EOL"/&gt;}}

Manatees have been found as far as {{convert|75|km|mi|0}} offshore, where there are shallow coastal flats and calm [[mangrove]] creeks filled with seagrass. Inland lakes where manatees dwell include [[Lake Volta]], the [[Inner Niger Delta|Inner Niger River Delta]] in Mali, [[Lake Léré]], and Lake de Tréné. Due to fluctuating flow rates and water levels in rivers, some of these permanent lakes serve as refuges for manatees in connecting rivers during the dry season. From north to south, the river systems that contain manatees include: the [[Sénégal River|Senegal]], [[Saloum River|Saloum]], [[Gambia River|Gambia]], [[Casamance River|Casamance]], Cacheu, Mansôa, [[Geba River|Geba]], Buba, Tombali, Cacine, Kogon, Kondoure, [[Sierra Leone River|Sierra Leone]], Great Scarcies, [[Little Scarcies River|Little Scarcies]], Sherbro, Malem, Waanje, Sewa, Missunado, [[Cavalla River|Cavalla]], [[Saint Paul River|St. Paul]], Morro, [[Saint John River (Liberia)|St. John]], [[Bandama River|Bandama]], Niouniourou, [[Sassandra River|Sassandra]], Comoé, [[Bia River|Bia]], [[Tano River|Tano]], [[Volta River|Volta]], [[Mono River|Mono]], [[Ouémé River|Oueme]], [[Niger River|Niger]], [[Mékrou River|Mekrou]], [[Benue River|Benue]], Cross, [[River Katsina Ala|Katsena Ala]], [[Bani River|Bani]], [[Akwayafe River|Akwayafe]], Rio del Rey, Ngosso, Andokat, Mene, Munaya, [[Wouri River|Wouri]], [[Sanaga River|Sanaga]], Faro, [[Chari River|Chari]], Bamaingui, Bahr-Kieta, [[Logone River|Logoné]], [[Mitémélé]], [[Gabon Estuary|Gabon]], Ogoué, Lovanzi, [[Kouilou-Niari River|Kouilou]], [[Congo River|Congo]], Dande, Bengo, and [[Cuanza River|Cuanza]]. Manatees move up these rivers until they are unable to proceed because of shallow waters or strong waterfalls.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;

The areas with the highest manatee populations are Guinea-Bissau, the lagoons of Côte d'Ivoire, the southern portions of the Niger River in Nigeria, the Sanaga River in Cameroon, the coastal lagoons in Gabon, and the lower parts of the Congo River. As part of a study completed in Côte d'Ivoire to assess where the majority of African manatees favor living, a sample of African manatees was radio-tagged and tracked. The tracking observed most of the sample in coastal lagoons, mangroves, and other [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] growths. They were also found in the grassy estuaries of big rivers with mangroves and in protected coastal spots with less than {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} of water containing both mangroves and marine [[macrophyte]]s.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;

==Diet==
Manatees are [[herbivore]]s; however, they also eat clams, [[mollusk]]s, and fish found in nets&lt;ref&gt;Keith Diagne, Lucy. (2014). Phylogenetics And Feeding Ecology Of The African Manatee, Trichechus senegalensis.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The percentage of the diet that is composed of non-plant material varies based on location &lt;ref name="IUCN" /&gt;.  With manatees living off the coast having a lifetime average of 50% non-plant material &lt;ref name="IUCN" /&gt;.  The West African manatee is the only Sirenian that seems to intentionally consume non-plant material.  A majority of the African manatee's diet is made up of a variety of [[flora]] found above or hanging over the water. African manatees that inhabit rivers mostly eat the overhanging plants growing on the river banks. The diet of African manatees living in estuaries consists solely of mangrove trees. Each day, the African manatee eats about four to nine percent of its body weight in wet vegetation.&lt;ref name="SeaWorld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AnimalCorner"/&gt; Microorganisms within the African manatee's large intestine, which measures up to {{convert|20|m|ft|0|disp=or}} in length, aid it in digesting the large quantity and variety of vegetation that it consumes daily.&lt;ref name="EOL"/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Congo Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History (1919) (20492574730).jpg|thumb|African manatee on land]]
The African manatee's body is widest at the middle, and its tail resembles a paddle. The manatee is gray in color with small, colorless hairs that cover its body. However, algae and other tiny organisms often grow on an African manatee's body, so its body sometimes appears brown or greenish in color. Calves are darker in color when they are very young.&lt;ref name="SeaWorld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EOL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MammalsOfTheWorld"/&gt; African manatees measure up to {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, and weigh about {{convert|360|kg|lb|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name="AnimalCorner"/&gt; African manatees are typically extremely slow, moving between 4.8&amp;nbsp;km and 8.0&amp;nbsp;km (3 and 5&amp;nbsp;mi) per hour, although when scared by predators they can travel at speeds of about {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} per hour. The African manatee's large forelimbs, or flippers, are used to paddle and to bring food to the its mouth. Vegetation is then  chewed by the manatee's strong molars, which are its only teeth. When the manatee is born, each jaw has two vestigial incisors, which the manatee loses as it matures.&lt;ref name="MammalsOfTheWorld"/&gt; If the African manatee's molars happen to fall out, new molars grow in their place. The manatee's flippers, which have nails, are also used to graze other manatees. The African manatee does not have any hind limbs.&lt;ref name="EOL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ParadiseEarth"&gt;{{cite web|title=West African manatee |publisher=Paradise Earth |year=2008 |url=http://www.paradiseearth.com/Animal%20Articles/Manatee.html |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082708/http://www.paradiseearth.com/Animal%20Articles/Manatee.html |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnimalInfo"&gt;{{cite web | title = West African Manatee | publisher = Animal Info | year = 2006 | url = http://www.animalinfo.org/species/tricsene.htm | accessdate = January 7, 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101119105212/http://animalinfo.org/species/tricsene.htm | archivedate = November 19, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dr. Macrini | first = Ted | title = "Trichechus senegalensis" (On-line) | publisher = Digital Morphology | year = 2004 | url = http://digimorph.org/specimens/Trichechus_senegalensis/ | accessdate = January 8, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101214181704/http://digimorph.org/specimens/Trichechus_senegalensis/| archivedate= 14 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the exterior, the African manatee looks very similar to the American manatee; however, the African manatee is different from the Amazonian manatee, which has characteristic white markings on its abdomen.&lt;ref name="AnimalInfo"/&gt;

==Evolution and legends==
The West African manatee is a descendant of trichechids found in coastal South America during the [[Pliocene|Pliocene Epoch]]. Although they tend to stay in freshwater, theory suggests that, through transoceanic currents, the species reached West Africa during the late Pliocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = O'Shea| first = Thomas J.| title = Manatees| journal = Scientific American| pages = 7| date = July 1994| url = http://faculty.bennington.edu/~sherman/the%20ocean%20project/manatees.pdf| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052412/http://faculty.bennington.edu/~sherman/the%20ocean%20project/manatees.pdf| archivedate = 2016-03-04| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The West African manatee's appearance is thought to be the result of these currents and species movement. The African manatee's ancestors passed down advantageous migration and food traits. The African manatee is not restricted to a certain area, and does not have to rely heavily on only one ecosystem for support. This evolution of the African manatee's diversity may be part of its key attribute to survival. They are more diverse than other manatees due to their ability to survive in salt water, although they do need access to fresh water for drinking purposes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bioexpedition.com/african-manatee/|title=African Manatee - Animal Facts and Information|website=www.bioexpedition.com|access-date=2016-11-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123133045/http://www.bioexpedition.com/african-manatee/|archivedate=2016-11-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to people of western Africa, ''Maame'' ''Water'' (also spelled ''[[Mami Wata]]''), a recurring character in many coastal legends, is a goddess of the sea and a symbol of wealth and beauty. ''Maame'' ''Water'' also flips over canoes and entices their occupants to visit her kingdom. Scientists from the Institute of Aquatic Biology of the Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Wildlife Department in Ghana have concluded that ''Maame'' ''Water'' is not a sea goddess, but actually the West African manatee. According to Dr. Mamaa Entsua-Mensah, who performs research for CSIR, when female African manatees surface for air, they resemble goddesses. Entsua-Mensah explains that the female manatee's breasts create the illusion of a woman-fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = West African Manatee| publisher = Sirenian International, Inc| year = 2002| url = http://www.sirenian.org/westafrican.html| accessdate = January 8, 2011| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110528195710/http://www.sirenian.org/westafrican.html| archivedate = 2011-05-28| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Serer people]] of Senegal, the Gambia and Mauritania, the manatee is regarded as sacred and highly respected, because in the [[Serer creation myth]], it is viewed as the guardian of the secrets of the future.&lt;ref&gt;Senghor, Léopold Sédar, "Chants d'ombre" [in] "Selected poems of LEOPOLD SEDAR SENGHOR", CUP Archive, pp. 103, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
The African manatee is [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]]. They tend to travel silently, eat, and be active towards the end of the day and during the nighttime. During the daytime, the African manatee dozes in shallow (1 to 2 meter deep) water. In countries such as Sierra Leone, African manatees migrate upstream when flooding occurs in June and July. This flooding can lower the availability of food for the manatees as well as lower the salinity of waterways.&lt;ref name="AnimalCorner"/&gt; African manatees live in groups of 1 to 6. They have very few natural predators, two of which are sharks and crocodiles.&lt;ref name="EOL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manatee Predators |publisher=Infoqis Publishing, Co. |year=2009 |url=http://manatee-world.com/manatee-predators.html |accessdate=January 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501004711/http://www.manatee-world.com/manatee-predators.html |archivedate=May 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also very social, spending a majority of their day bonding by touch, verbal communication, and smell. This creates a deep bond between them. When it is time to migrate due to a weather change, manatees will travel in larger groups to find warmer water and food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Reproduction==
The sex of an individual African manatee can only be determined by close examination of the manatee's underside. The only visible distinction between males and females is the genital openings. However, males tend to be smaller than females. Some female African manatees are sexually mature as young as 3 years of age, and they give birth every 3 to 5 years of their estimated 30-year lifespan. Males take a longer time to mature (about 9 to 10 years) and can rarely fertilize an egg at the age of 2 or 3 years. African manatees breed year-round. When males and females mate, it is not monogamous; multiple males will usually mate with one female.&lt;ref name="SeaWorld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MammalsOfTheWorld"&gt;{{cite web|last = Jefferson|first = T.A.|author2 = Leatherwood, S.|author3 = Webber, M.A.|title = Trichechus senegalensis|publisher = nlbif|url = http://wbd.etibioinformatics.nl/bis/marine_mammals.php?menuentry=soorten&amp;id=152|accessdate = January 8, 2011|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140302094801/http://wbd.etibioinformatics.nl/bis/marine_mammals.php?menuentry=soorten&amp;id=152|archivedate = 2014-03-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the opportunity to mate with a female is at stake, males will fight with each other by pushing and shoving. Female African manatees give birth to one calf at a time after about a 13-month pregnancy. Calves can swim on their own at birth. Although the African manatee's social organization is not well understood, research shows the most common and tightly knit bonds are between a mother and her calf.&lt;ref name="EOL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trichechus senegalensis|publisher=Encyclopedia of Life|url=http://eol.org/pages/328645/details|accessdate=January 7, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305113132/http://eol.org/pages/328645/details|archivedate=March 5, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
The African manatee is a vulnerable species because of its meat, oil, bones, and skin, which can bring great wealth to poachers. Specifically they are used to make walking sticks and toy spinning tops. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, African manatees are sold to zoos, aquariums, online as pets, and they are sometimes shipped internationally. Anyone visiting such countries will notice manatee meat being sold on the streets and in marketplaces, but the lack of law enforcement protects the poachers from punishment. Residents of countries such as Mali and Chad depend on the oil of the African manatee to cure ailments such as ear infections, [[rheumatism]], and skin conditions.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;

There are even more threats to the African manatees' habitat and life: urban and agricultural development, increased damming, and increased use of hydroelectric power in the rivers of countries like Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. The building of dams has lead to genetic isolation of some populations&lt;ref name="IUCN" /&gt;. There is little data to show if this has any negative long-term effects on the population as a whole. At several hydroelectric dams including the Kanji dam on the Niger River and the Akosombo dam on the Volta River manatees have been caught and killed in the turbines and intake valves&lt;ref name="IUCN" /&gt;. Thick congestion of boats in waterways may cause the manatees to have deadly run-ins with the vessels. However, even natural occurrences, such as droughts and tidal changes, can often strand manatees in unsuitable habitats. Some are killed accidentally by fishing trawls and in nets which are intended for catching sharks.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;

Some behaviors of African manatees provoke humans to hunt them. When manatees become tangled in fishing nets, they can damage them. People in countries such as Sierra Leone believe that killing the manatees to reduce the species size lowers the chances of the fishing nets requiring expensive repairs. In addition, African manatees can destroy rice crops by drifting into fields during the rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis) | publisher = Wildscreen | year = 2011 | url = http://www.arkive.org/african-manatee/trichechus-senegalensis/#text=Threats | accessdate = December 30, 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111130010140/http://www.arkive.org/african-manatee/trichechus-senegalensis/#text=Threats | archivedate = November 30, 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the African manatees that venture up the Niger River starve to death. At certain times each year, the Niger River dries up due to the hot temperatures and lack of rain. Many manatees migrate there during the rainy season. When the water dries up the manatees are unable to get to other bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manatee-world.com/african-manatee/|title=African Manatee - Manatee Facts and Information|website=www.manatee-world.com|access-date=2016-11-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123201229/http://www.manatee-world.com/african-manatee/|archivedate=2016-11-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
From November 2004 until December 2007, the West African Manatee Conservation Project completed Phase I. During this phase, residents of six African countries (Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone) created a database of previously unknown information about the species (such as population, economic value, and habitat range) by conducting surveys in their countries. Other African countries also contributed reports that broadened the collective knowledge of the African manatee. Because of the work done during this phase, the general public, young children, and experienced scientists alike are receiving better information than ever before as to how to protect the African manatees. Phase I also allowed for up-close examination of the African manatee's way of life through field work.

Due to the large-scale success of Phase I, a Phase II is to be enacted by [[Wetlands International]]. During Phase II, the information collected in Phase I will be even more widely distributed around the areas in which the African manatee lives. Phase II will focus on furthering the existing research and adjusting legislation and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dr. Dagou |first=Mame |last2=Greatrix |first2=Emma |title=Conservation Prospects for the West African Manatee |date=November 3, 2007 |url=http://www.africanconservation.org/20071103252/network-news-section/conservation-prospects-for-the-west-african-manatee |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722222314/http://www.africanconservation.org/20071103252/network-news-section/conservation-prospects-for-the-west-african-manatee |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 22, 2012 |accessdate=January 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the African manatee is endangered. CITES states that trade in any species on the list, including the African manatee, is to be carefully monitored and terminated. Laws exist to protect the African manatee in every country in which it lives, but these laws are not well enforced. Due to this mass lack of enforcement and minimal education, the African manatee population is being steadily depleted.&lt;ref name="EOL"/&gt;

'''James Allan Thomson''' (27 July 1881 &amp;ndash; 6 May 1928) was a New Zealand geologist, scientific administrator and museum director. 

He was born in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand, in 1881, where his father was a science teacher at [[Otago Boys' High School]]. He graduated from [[Otago University]] in 1904, the same year as [[Sir Peter Buck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/library/exhibitions/rhodes_scholars/pdf/allan_thomson.pdf|format=PDF|title=Allan Thomson : New Zealand’s first Rhodes scholar|website=Otago.ac.nz|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Selected as New Zealand's first [[Rhodes Scholar]], he studied geology, played [[Rugby union|rugby]], rowed and ran at [[ St John's College, Oxford]]. 

After doing geology in Australia, he was appointed palaeontologist with the [[New Zealand Geological Survey]] in 1911 and then succeeded [[Augustus Hamilton]] as director of the Dominion Museum (now [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Te Papa]]) in 1914. &lt;ref name="DNZB Thomson"&gt;{{DNZB|title=James Allan Thomson|first= N. De B.|last= Hornibrook|id=3t33|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was accepted as a geologist on [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s [[Terra Nova Expedition]] to [[Antarctica]], but he developed [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] and was forced to withdraw. The [[tuberculosis]] continued to trouble him and his health declined.&lt;ref name="DNZB Thomson"/&gt;

He was president of the [[Royal Society of New Zealand]] for a short time before his death in 1928; he was preceded by [[ Bernard Cracroft Aston]], who also stepped in after his death until the appointment of [[ Clinton Coleridge Farr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org.nz/who-we-are/our-people/our-council/presidents/|title=Royal Society Te Apārangi - Presidents|website=Royalsociety.org.nz|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His daughter [[Margaret Thomson|Margaret]] became a noted film director.&lt;ref name=nzonscreen&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzonscreen.com/person/margaret-thomson/biography|title=Margaret Thomson - NZ On Screen|website=Nzonscreen.com|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''Atomic engineering'''" appears to have been first used in 1946 by Theodore von Kármán,&lt;ref&gt;Theodore von Kármán, "Atomic Engineering?", Journal of Applied Physics 17 (1946) 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "And now it seems we are at the threshold of the new atomic age. I do not know whether or not this is true, but certainly, we shall have 'atomic engineering' in the fields of power and transportation. Are we prepared for the problems involved?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Atomic power]], which, today, is generally considered to be in the discipline of [[nuclear engineering]], is an example of what he had in mind.

Atomic engineering may be a superset of [[nuclear engineering]], due to the historical usage of terms like [[Atoms for Peace]] , [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], 'atomic engineer', etc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.
An inclusive definition is: "exploiting the atomic characters of matter for [[engineering]] applications." For example, an [[atomic clock]] and potential applications of [[ultracold atoms|ultra-cold atom]] belong to atomic engineering. The atomic character could be the atomic spin (e.g. in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] and [[quantum computing]] applications), atomic position (e.g. [[Optical lattice]]), atomic mass (e.g. atomic power), etc.

The creation of the atomic bomb by Julius Robert Oppenheimer, the "Father of the atomic bomb", is based on atomic engineering. Oppenheimer was a university professor and physicist at the University of California, Berkeley.

[[Richard Feynman]], in his famous 1959 lecture "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]" on the trend of [[miniaturization]], envisioned:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "But I am not afraid to consider the final question as to whether, ultimately – in the great future – we can arrange the atoms the way we want; the very atoms, all the way down! What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one the way we want them. … When we get to the very, very, small world – say circuits of seven atoms – we have a lot of new things that would happen that represent completely new opportunities for design. Atoms on a small scale behave like nothing on a large scale, for they satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics. So, as we go down and fiddle around with the atoms down there, we are working with different laws, and we can expect to do different things. We can manufacture in different ways. We can use, not just circuits, but some system involving the quantized energy levels, or the interactions of quantized spins, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Feynman, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom", Caltech Engineering and Science 23 (5), 22 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most practices of [[nanotechnology]] and [[materials science]] today have foci distinct from Feynman's ultimate vision of manipulating individual atomic position and spin, which may be better described by "Atomic engineering", that addresses characteristic length scales from 1 [[femtometer]] (the [[atomic nucleus]] size) to 1 [[nanometer]] (about 5 atoms across in linear dimension).  Coherent quantum control of individual atomic defect like the [[Nitrogen-vacancy center]], and the eventual "[[3D atom printing]]" ("2D atom printing" was realized in 1990 by IBM&lt;ref&gt;D. M. EIGLER and E. K. SCHWEIZER, "Positioning single atoms with a scanning tunnelling microscope", Nature 344 (1990) 524-526.&lt;/ref&gt; using a [[scanning tunnelling microscope]]), fit Feynman's ultimate vision.

'''Change''' refers to a difference in a state of affairs at different points in [[time]]. Although it is a familiar experience, an analysis of change provides subtle problems which have occupied [[philosopher]]s since the [[Presocratics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Change and Inconsistency|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/change/#intro|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heraclitus]] is the first philosopher known to have directly raised such issues, with [[aphorism]]s such as "one cannot step into the same river twice". The [[Eleatics]] were particularly concerned with change and raised a number of problems, including [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno's]] [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]], which caused them to go as far as insisting that change was impossible, and that reality was one and unchanging. Later philosophers would reject this conclusion, instead developing systems such as [[atomism]] in attempts to circumvent the Eleatic problems. In the [[modernity|modern era]], some of these problems would enter the domain of [[mathematics]], with the development of [[calculus]] and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. These developments were regarded by some as solving problems of change, but others maintain that philosophical issues persist.

==In Chinese philosophy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
The Chinese philosophy of change was described in centuries of commentary on the ''[[I Ching]]'', the Book of Changes.

== In Greek philosophy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
[[Heraclitus]] is the first philosopher for whom there exists an extant written account of an enquiry into change. Writing in an [[aphorism|aphoristic]] and esoteric style, Heraclitus remarked that, "On those stepping into rivers staying the same other and other waters flow". Or, more popularly: "One cannot step into the same river twice." This is generally taken to refer to the seeming contradiction between our calling a river "the same", while knowing that the material constituents of a river, the "waters", have completely changed. (A later follower amended the final word in the saying from "twice" to "once".)

It is unclear what reaction Heraclitus intends to induce by this statement, and he provides no exposition. It is however but one of many examples of a more general theme which Heraclitus termed the "unity of opposites" - the fact that opposing [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s could be asserted of the same thing, another example being, "the road up and the road down is one and the same".

=== The Eleatics ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
Change was one of the chief concerns of the [[Eleatic]] school of thought founded by [[Parmenides]]. Parmenides considered non-existence to be absurd, and thus asserted that it was impossible for something to come into existence out of nothing, or for something to pass out of existence into nothing. By "something", he was referring not just to material, but to any general predicate; rejecting, for instance, changes of colour, as they involved the new colour arising from nothing and the old colour passing into nothing. He therefore rejected all change as impossible, and claimed that reality was an undifferentiated and unchanging whole.

These ideas were taken up by various followers of Parmenides, most notably [[Melissus of Samos|Melissus]] and [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], who provided additional arguments, specifically for the impossibility of [[motion (physics)|motion]]. Melissus claimed that reality was "full" (nonexistence being impossible), and that therefore nothing could move. Zeno gave a series of arguments which were particularly influential. Among the simplest was his observation that to move from A to B, one must first reach the halfway point between A and B; but then in order to do this, one must get halfway from A to this halfway point; and so on. Thus all motion involves an infinite number of steps, which Zeno held to be impossible. A similar argument involved a footrace between [[Achilles]] and a [[tortoise]]. The tortoise is given a headstart. Achilles quickly reaches the point where the tortoise stood, but by this time the tortoise has moved on a little, so Achilles must now reach this new point, and so on. A different argument involved the flight of an [[arrow]]. Zeno observed that if one considers a single moment of time, the arrow is not moving in that moment. He then claimed it was impossible that an arrow in motion could arise as the result of a sequence of motionless arrows.

=== Responses to the Eleatics ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
The [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]] can be seen as a response to the Eleatic denial of change. The atomists conceded that something coming from or becoming nothing was impossible, but only with respect to [[matter|material substance]], not to general qualities. They hypothesised that every visible object was in fact a composite of unseen indivisible particles of different shapes and sizes. These particles were held to be eternal and unchanging, but by rearranging themselves, the composite objects which they formed could come into and go out of being. These composite objects and their properties were not taken as truly real; in the words of Democritus, "by convention sweet, by convention bitter; by convention hot, by convention cold; by convention colour: but in reality atoms and void." Any perceived change in an object's properties was therefore illusory and not susceptible to the objections of Parmenides.

[[Anaxagoras]] provided a similar response, but instead of atoms, he hypothesised a number of eternal, primal "ingredients" which were mixed together in a [[continuum (measurement)|continuum]]. No material object was made of a pure ingredient; rather, it had its material character due to a preponderance of various ingredients over every other. In this way, Anaxagoras could assert that nowhere did any ingredient ever fully come into or go out of being.

'''Chemical engineering''' is a branch of [[engineering]] that uses principles of [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], and [[economics]] to efficiently use, produce, transform, and transport chemicals, materials, and energy. A chemical engineer designs large-scale processes that convert chemicals, raw materials, living cells, microorganisms, and energy into useful forms and products.

Chemical engineers are involved in many aspects of plant design and operation, including safety and hazard assessments, process design and analysis, [[control engineering]], [[chemical reaction engineering]], construction specification, and operating instructions.

==Etymology==
[[File:Davis GE.jpg|thumb|150px|[[George E. Davis]]]]

A 1996 ''[[British Journal for the History of Science]]'' article cites James F. Donnelly for mentioning an 1839 reference to chemical engineering in relation to the production of [[sulfuric acid]].{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=172}} In the same paper however, [[George E. Davis]], an English consultant, was credited for having coined the term.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=174}} Davis also tried to found a ''Society of Chemical Engineering'', but instead it was named the [[Society of Chemical Industry]] (1881), with Davis as its first Secretary.&lt;ref name="Swindin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swindin|first1=N.|title=George E. Davis memorial lecture|journal=Transactions of the Institution of Chemical Engineers|date=1953|volume=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flavell-While"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flavell-While|first1=Claudia|title=Chemical Engineers Who Changed the World: Meet the Daddy|url=http://www.thechemicalengineer.com/~/media/Documents/TCE/Articles/2012/849/849cewctw.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2016|work=The Chemical Engineer|agency=52-54|date=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028085216/http://www.thechemicalengineer.com/~/media/Documents/TCE/Articles/2012/849/849cewctw.pdf|archivedate=28 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''History of Science in United States: An Encyclopedia'' puts the use of the term around 1890.{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=176}} "Chemical engineering", describing the use of mechanical equipment in the chemical industry, became common vocabulary in England after 1850.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=186}} By 1910, the profession, "chemical engineer," was already in common use in Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=20}}

==History==
{{main|History of chemical engineering}} 
Chemical engineering emerged upon the development of [[unit operations]], a fundamental concept of the discipline of chemical engineering. Most authors agree that Davis invented the concept of unit operations if not substantially developed it.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|pp=172–173}} He gave a series of lectures on unit operations at the [[Manchester Technical School]] (later part of the [[University of Manchester]]) in 1887, considered to be one of the earliest such about chemical engineering.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=175}} Three years before Davis' lectures, [[Henry Edward Armstrong]] taught a degree course in chemical engineering at the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]]. Armstrong's course failed simply because its graduates ... were not especially attractive to employers. Employers of the time would have rather hired chemists and [[mechanical engineers]].{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=176}} Courses in chemical engineering offered by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the United States, [[Owens College, Manchester|Owens College]] in [[Manchester]], England, and [[University College London]] suffered under similar circumstances.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=178}}

[[File:MIT Industrial Chemistry Lab.gif|thumb|Students inside an industrial chemistry laboratory at MIT|250px]]

Starting from 1888,{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=180}} [[Lewis M. Norton]] taught at MIT the first chemical engineering course in the United States. Norton's course was contemporaneous and essentially similar to Armstrong's course. Both courses, however, simply merged chemistry and engineering subjects along with product design. "Its practitioners had difficulty convincing engineers that they were engineers and chemists that they were not simply chemists."{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=176}} Unit operations was introduced into the course by [[William Hultz Walker]] in 1905.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=183}} By the early 1920s, unit operations became an important aspect of chemical engineering at MIT and other US universities, as well as at [[Imperial College London]].{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=184}} The [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] (AIChE), established in 1908, played a key role in making chemical engineering considered an independent science, and unit operations central to chemical engineering. For instance, it defined chemical engineering to be a "science of itself, the basis of which is ... unit operations" in a 1922 report; and with which principle, it had published a list of academic institutions which offered "satisfactory" chemical engineering courses.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=187}} Meanwhile, promoting chemical engineering as a distinct science in Britain lead to the establishment of the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]] (IChemE) in 1922.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=189}} IChemE likewise helped make unit operations considered essential to the discipline.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=190}}

===New concepts and innovations===
By the 1940s, it became clear that unit operations alone were insufficient in developing [[chemical reactor]]s. While the predominance of unit operations in chemical engineering courses in Britain and the United States continued until the 1960s, [[Transport phenomena (engineering &amp; physics)|transport phenomena]] started to experience greater focus.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=185}} Along with other novel concepts, such as [[process systems engineering]] (PSE), a "second paradigm" was defined.{{sfn|Ogawa|2007|p=2}}{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=29}} Transport phenomena gave an [[systems analysis|analytical]] approach to chemical engineering{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=30}} while PSE focused on its synthetic elements, such as [[control system]] and [[Process design (chemical engineering)|process design]].{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=31}} Developments in chemical engineering before and after [[World War II]] were mainly incited by the [[petrochemical industry]],{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=177}} however, advances in other fields were made as well. Advancements in [[biochemical engineering]] in the 1940s, for example, found application in the [[pharmaceutical industry]], and allowed for the [[mass production]] of various [[antibiotic]]s, including [[penicillin]] and [[streptomycin]].{{sfn|Perkins|2003|pp=32–33}} Meanwhile, progress in [[polymer science]] in the 1950s paved way for the "age of plastics".{{sfn|Kim|2002|p=7S}}

===Safety and hazard developments===
Concerns regarding the safety and environmental impact of large-scale chemical manufacturing facilities were also raised during this period. ''[[Silent Spring]]'', published in 1962, alerted its readers to the harmful effects of [[DDT]], a potent [[insecticide]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The 1974 [[Flixborough disaster]] in the United Kingdom resulted in 28 deaths, as well as damage to a [[chemical plant]] and three nearby villages.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]] in India resulted in almost 4,000 deaths.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} These incidents, along with [[List of industrial disasters|other incidents]], affected the reputation of the trade as [[industrial safety]] and [[environmental protection]] were given more focus.{{sfn|Kim|2002|p=8S}} In response, the IChemE required safety to be part of every degree course that it accredited after 1982. By the 1970s, legislation and monitoring agencies were instituted in various countries, such as France, Germany, and the United States.{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=35}}

===Recent progress===
Advancements in [[computer science]] found applications designing and managing plants, simplifying calculations and drawings that previously had to be done manually. The completion of the [[Human Genome Project]] is also seen as a major development, not only advancing chemical engineering but [[genetic engineering]] and [[genomics]] as well.{{sfn|Kim|2002|p=9S}} Chemical engineering principles were used to produce [[DNA sequences]] in large quantities.{{sfn|American Institute of Chemical Engineers|2003a}}

{{chemical engineering}}

Chemical engineering involves the application of several principles. Key concepts are presented below.

===Plant design and construction===
Chemical engineering design concerns the creation of plans, specification, and economic analyses for [[pilot plant]]s, new plants or plant modifications. Design engineers often work in a consulting role, designing plants to meet clients' needs. Design is limited by a number of factors, including funding, government regulations and safety standards. These constraints dictate a plant's choice of process, materials and equipment.{{sfn|Towler|Sinnott|2008|pp=2–3}}

Plant construction is coordinated by [[project engineering|project engineers]] and project managers &lt;ref&gt;Herbst, Andrew; Hans Verwijs (Oct. 19-22). "Project Engineering: Interdisciplinary Coordination and Overall Engineering Quality Control". Proc. of the Annual IAC conference of the American Society for Engineering Management 1 ({{ISBN|9781618393616}}): 15–21&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the size of the investment. A chemical engineer may do the job of project engineer full-time or part of the time, which requires additional training and job skills or act as a consultant to the project group. In the USA the education of chemical engineering graduates from the Baccalaureate programs accredited by [[ABET]] do not usually stress project engineering education, which can be obtained by specialized training, as electives, or from [[graduate programs]].  Project engineering jobs are some of the largest employers for chemical engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Do Chemical Engineers Do?|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistrystudentfaqs/f/chemeng.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process design and analysis===
{{main|Process design}}

A unit operation is a physical step in an individual chemical engineering process. Unit operations (such as [[crystallization]], [[filtration]], [[drying]] and [[evaporation]]) are used to prepare reactants, purifying and separating its products, recycling unspent reactants, and controlling energy transfer in reactors.{{sfn|McCabe|Smith|Hariott|1993|p=4}} On the other hand, a unit process is the chemical equivalent of a unit operation. Along with unit operations, unit processes constitute a process operation. Unit processes (such as [[nitration]] and [[oxidation]]) involve the conversion of material by [[biochemical]], [[thermochemical]] and other means. Chemical engineers responsible for these are called process engineers.{{sfn|Silla|2003|pp=8–9}}

Process design requires the definition of equipment types and sizes as well as how they are connected together and the materials of construction. Details are often printed on a [[Process Flow Diagram]] which is used to control the capacity and reliability of a new or modified chemical factory.

[[Education for Chemical Engineers|Education for chemical engineers]] in the first college degree 3 or 4 years of study stresses the principles and practices of process design. The same skills are used in existing chemical plants to evaluate the [[Economics#Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and make recommendations for improvements.

===Transport phenomena===
{{main|Transport phenomena}}

Modeling and analysis of transport phenomena is essential for many industrial applications. Transport phenomena involve [[fluid dynamics]], [[heat transfer]] and [[mass transfer]], which are governed mainly by [[momentum transfer]], [[energy transfer]] and transport of [[chemical species]] respectively. Models often involve separate considerations for  [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]], [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] and [[molecular]] level phenomena. Modeling of transport phenomena therefore requires an understanding of applied mathematics.{{sfn|Bird|Stewart|Lightfoot|2002|pp=1–2}}

==Applications and practice==
[[File:Chemengg.jpg|thumb|left|Chemical engineers use computers to control automated systems in plants.{{sfn|Garner|2003|pp=47–48}}|alt=Two computer flat screens showing a plant process management application]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-0205-015, Chemiekombinat Bitterfeld, Produktion von Weißtönern.jpg|right|thumb|Operators in a chemical plant using an older analog control board, seen in East-Germany, 1986.]]

[[Chemical engineer]]s "develop economic ways of using materials and energy".{{sfn|American Institute of Chemical Engineers|2003|loc=Article III}} Chemical engineers use [[chemistry]] and engineering to turn raw materials into usable products, such as medicine, petrochemicals and plastics on a large-scale, industrial setting. They are also involved in [[waste management]] and research. Both applied and research facets could make extensive use of computers.{{sfn|Garner|2003|pp=47–48}}

Chemical engineers may be involved in industry or university research where they are tasked with designing and performing experiments to create better and safer methods for production, pollution control, and resource conservation. They may be involved in designing and constructing plants as a [[project engineer]]. Chemical engineers serving as project engineers use their knowledge in selecting optimal production methods and plant equipment to minimize costs and maximize safety and profitability. After plant construction, chemical engineering project managers may be involved in equipment upgrades, process changes, troubleshooting, and daily operations in either full-time or consulting roles. {{sfn|Garner|2003|pp=49–50}}

While based in fiction, research into energy-based weapons inspired by past speculation has contributed to real-life weapons in use by modern militaries sometimes called a sort of "death ray", such as the [[United States Navy]] and its [[Laser Weapon System]] (LaWS) deployed in mid-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/navy-will-deploy-first-ship-with-laser-weapon-this-summer/|title=Navy will deploy first ship with laser weapon this summer|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|date=2014-06-03|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/innovation/05/31/navy.death.ray.wired/|title=Navy's drone death ray takes out targets  - CNN.com|last=Hodge|first=Nathan|date=2010-06-03|work=[[CNN.com]]|access-date=2018-05-28|agency=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such armaments are technically known as [[directed-energy weapons ]].

==History==
In the year 1923, Edwin R. Scott, an inventor from [[San Francisco]], claimed he was the first to develop a death ray that would destroy human life and bring down planes at a distance.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;  He was born in [[Detroit]], and he claimed he worked for nine years as a student and protégé of [[Charles P. Steinmetz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Death Stroke |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,720718,00.html |quote=Utmost secrecy always shrouds the structural details of new munitions of war. This one, announced last week by its inventor, Dr. Edwin R. Scott, is called the 'death stroke' or 'canned lightning'. The Navy Department, which has been in touch with Dr. Scott's researches, hinted that the ultraviolet ray was involved, but Dr. Scott stated specifically: 'There is no ray or beam about it.' |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= August 10, 1925 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Harry Grindell-Matthews]] tried to sell what he reported to be a death ray to the British [[Air Ministry]] in 1924. He was never able to show a functioning model or demonstrate it to the military.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Denies British Invented 'Death Ray'.

Tesla explained that "this invention of mine does not contemplate the use of any so-called 'death rays'. Rays are not applicable because they cannot be produced in requisite quantities and diminish rapidly in intensity with distance. All the energy of New York City (approximately two million horsepower) transformed into rays and projected twenty miles, could not kill a human being, because, according to a well known law of physics, it would disperse to such an extent as to be ineffectual. My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of microscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great distance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of any kind. Many thousands of horsepower can thus be transmitted by a stream thinner than a hair, so that nothing can resist."&lt;ref name="A Machine to End War"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Machine to End War|url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art11.html|work=PBS: Tesla - Master of Lightning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla proposed that a nation could "destroy anything approaching within 200 miles ... [and] will provide a wall of power" in order to "make any country, large or small, impregnable against armies, airplanes, and other means for attack".&lt;ref name="A Machine to End War"/&gt; He claimed that he worked on the project since about 1900.He claimed to have drawn power from the ionosphere, which he called "An invisibe ball of energy surrounding Earth."

During World War II, the Germans had at least two projects, and the Japanese one, to create so called death rays. One German project led by Ernst Schiebold concerned a particle accelerator with a steerable bundle of beryllium rods running through the vertical axis. The other was developed by Dr [[Rolf Widerøe]] and is referred to in his biography. The machine developed by Widerøe was in the Dresden Plasma Physics laboratory in February 1945 when the city was bombed. Widerøe led a team in March 1945 to remove the device from the ruined laboratory and deliver it to General Patton's 3rd Army at Burggrub where it was taken into US custody on 14 April 1945.  The Japanese weapon was called Death ray "Ku-Go" which aimed to employ [[microwaves]] created in a large [[magnetron]].

==In science fiction==
Although the concept of a death ray was never put into action, it fueled science fiction stories and led to the science fiction concept of the handheld [[raygun]] used by fictional characters such as [[Flash Gordon]]. In [[Alfred Noyes]]' 1940 novel ''The Last Man'' (US title: ''No Other Man''), a death ray developed by a [[Germans|German]] scientist named Mardok is unleashed in a global war and almost wipes out the human race. Similar weapons are found in [[George Lucas]]' science fiction saga ''[[Star Wars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Charles.

The environmental revolution follows other technological revolutions such as the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[Digital Revolution]].
[[Image:Enten und Gänse als Gartenhelfer.jpg|thumb|right|400px|An example of '''permaculture''', a [[sustainable]] form of [[farming]], using animals and gardens.]]

==History==

The environmental movement has its roots in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="mtmultipleuse1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtmultipleuse.org/endangered/esahistory.htm |title=History of Environmentalism |publisher=Mtmultipleuse.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Underwood Johnson]] and [[John Muir]] founded the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892 after successfully lobbying Congress to create [[Yosemite National Park]].

The modern environmental movement began in the mid-to-late 1960s.&lt;ref name="mtmultipleuse1"/&gt; Environmental problems had been illustrated in books such as [[Silent Spring]] and there was a [[back-to-the-land movement]], closely associated with the [[Hippie movement]] and [[Counterculture]].

By the 1990s, the need for [[green technology]] was realized, and the development of [[electric cars]] and [[alternative energy]] gradually began to become mainstream. In the first decades of the 21st century, significant progress has been made. The first new electric cars were released to the public in 2010, and environmentalism has gone from being fringe to being completely mainstream, even embraced by [[Conservatism|conservative]] institutions such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==New technologies==

Many environmentally friendly technologies, such as electric cars, [[solar power]], [[geothermal energy]], [[wind power]], [[vertical farming]], [[recycling]], [[permaculture]], [[hydroponics]], [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] technology such as [[fluorescent lighting]] and [[LEDs]] and [[high-speed rail]] have been implemented or have become mainstream in Western nations since 1980. Developing nations have also embraced these technologies, and China has become the world's leading manufacturer of wind turbines and solar-electric panels in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/business/energy-environment/31renew.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=China Leading Global Race to Make Clean Energy « |publisher=nytimes.org |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Eye movement]] in scene viewing''' refers to the [[visual processing]] of information presented in scenes. This phenomenon has been studied in a range of areas such as [[cognitive psychology]] and [[psychophysics]], where eye movement can be monitored under experimental conditions. A core aspect in these studies is the division of eye movements into [[saccades]], the rapid movement of the eyes, and fixations, the focus of the eyes on a point. There are several factors which influence eye movement in scene viewing, both the task and knowledge of the viewer (top-down factors), and the properties of the image being viewed (bottom-up factors). The study of eye movement in scene viewing helps to understand visual processing in more natural environments.

Typically, when presented with a scene, viewers demonstrate short fixation durations and long saccade amplitudes in the earlier phases of viewing an image, representing ambient processing. This is followed by longer fixations and shorter saccades in the latter phases of scene viewing, representing focal processing (Pannasch et al., 2008).

Eye movement behaviour in scene viewing differs between different levels of cognitive development. Fixation durations shorten and saccade amplitudes lengthen with the increase in age. In children, the development of saccades to the amplitude normally found in adults have occur earlier (4–6 years old) than the development of fixation durations (6–8 years old). Yet, the typical pattern of behaviour during scene viewing, when progressing from ambient processing to focal processing, has been observed to occur from the age of 2 years old (Helo, Pannasch, Sirri &amp; Rämä, 2014).

== Spatial variation ==

There are particular factors which affect where eye movements fixate upon, these include bottom-up factors inherent to the stimulus, and top-down factors inherent to the viewer. Even an initial glimpse of a scene has been found to generate an abstract representation of the image that can be stored in memory for use in subsequent eye movements (Castelhano &amp; Henderson, 2007).

In bottom-up factors, eye guidance can be affected by the local contrast or salience of features in an image (Itti &amp; Koch, 2000). An example of this would be an area with a large difference in luminance (Parkhurst et al., 2002), a greater density of edges (Mannan, Ruddock &amp; Wooding, 1996) or binocular disparity determining the distance of different objects on the scene (Jansen et al., 2009).

The top-down factors of scenes have more of an impact than bottom-up features in affecting fixation positions. Behaviourally relevant information that are more interesting in a scene is more salient than low-level features, drawing fixations more frequently and more quickly from scene onset (Onat, Açik, Schumann &amp; König, 2014). Local scene colour in a fixation position has an influence on where fixations occur. The presence of colour can increase the likelihood of the item being processed as a semantic object as it can aid the discrimination of the object, making it more interesting to view (Amano &amp; Foster, 2014). When viewers are semantically primed by being presented with consistently similar scenes, the density of fixations increase, and fixation durations decrease (Henderson, Weeks Jr., &amp; Hollingworth, 1999).

Information separate to what is presented in a scene also has an effect on the area being fixated upon. Eye movements can be guided anticipatorily by linguistic input, where if an item in the scene is presented verbally, the listener will be more likely to move their visual focus to that object (Staub, Abott &amp; Bogartz, 2012).
With regard to factors relating to viewers rather than the scene, differences have been found in cross-cultural research. Westerners have an inclination to concentrate on focal objects in a scene, where they look at focal objects more often and quicker in comparison to East Asians who attend more to contextual information, where they make more saccades to the background of the scene (Chua, Boland &amp; Nisbett, 2002).

== Temporal variation ==

Regarding the temporality of fixations,  average fixation durations last for 300ms on average, although there is a large variability around this approximation. Some of this variability can be explained through global properties of an image, impacting upon both bottom-up processing and top-down processing.

During natural scene viewing, the masking of an image by replacing it with a grey field during fixations has an increase in fixation durations (Henderson &amp; Pierce, 2008). More subtle degradations of an image on fixation durations, such as the decrease in luminance of an image during fixations, also increases the length of fixation durations (Henderson, Nuthmann &amp; Luke, 2013). An asymmetric effect is shown where the increase of luminance also increases fixation durations (Walshe &amp; Nuthmann, 2014). However, the change in factors affecting top-down processing, such as [[Gaussian blur|blur]]ring or [[phase noise]], increases fixation durations when used to degrade a scene and decreases fixation durations when used to enhance a scene (Henderson, Olejarczyk, Luke &amp; Schmidt, 2014; Einhäuser et al., 2006).

Furthermore, temporal and spatial aspects interact in a complex manner. When a picture is first presented on the screen, fixations made within the first second are more likely to be directed toward the left side of the scene, whereas the opposite holds true for the remaining part of the presentation (Ossandón et al., 2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3821">A '''power quantity''' is a power or a quantity directly proportional to [[Power (physics)|power]], e.g., [[energy density]], [[acoustic intensity]], and [[luminous intensity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ainslie |first=Michael A. |url=http://acousticstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/A-Century-of-Sonar.pdf |title=A Century of Sonar: Planetary Oceanography, Underwater Noise Monitoring, and the Terminology of Underwater Sound |journal=Acoustics Today |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=12–19 |date=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy quantities may also be labelled as power quantities in this context.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000:1-2009 §&amp;nbsp;C.3&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''root-power quantity''' is a quantity such as [[voltage]], [[Electric current|current]], [[sound pressure]], [[electric field strength]], [[speed]], or [[charge density]], the square of which, in linear systems, is proportional to power.&lt;ref name=Hearing&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian C.J. Moore |title=Hearing |date=1995 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-053386-5 |page=11 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=OywDx9pxCMYC |page=11 }} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''root-power quantity'' was introduced in the {{section link|ISO 80000-1|Annex C}}; it replaces and deprecates the term '''field quantity'''.

It is essential to know which category a measurement belongs to when using [[decibel]]s (dB) for comparing the [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]]s of such quantities.  A change of one bel in the level corresponds to a 10× change in ''power'', so when comparing power quantities ''x'' and ''y'', the difference is defined to be 10×log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''/''x'') decibel.  With root-power quantities, however the difference is defined as 20×log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''/''x'') dB.&lt;ref name=Hearing/&gt;  In linear systems, these definitions allow the distinction between root-power quantities and power quantities to be ignored when specifying changes as levels: an amplifier can be described as having "3&amp;nbsp;dB" of gain without needing to specify whether voltage or power are being compared; for a given linear load (e.g. an {{val|8|ul=Ω}} speaker), such an increase will result in a 3&amp;nbsp;dB increase in both the [[sound pressure level]] and the [[sound power level]] at a given location near the speaker.  Conversely, when ratios cannot be identified as either power or root-power quantities, the units [[neper]] (Np) and [[decibel]] (dB) cannot be sensibly used.

In the analysis of signals and systems using sinusoids, field quantities and root-power quantities may be [[complex number|complex]]-valued.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-1:2009 §&amp;nbsp;C.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-3:2006 §&amp;nbsp;0.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60027-3:2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Root-power quantity" vs. "field quantity"==
In justifying the deprecation of the term "field quantity" and instead using "root-power quantity" in the context of levels, ISO&amp;nbsp;80000 draws attention to the conflicting use of the former term to mean a quantity that depends on the position,&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-1:2009 §&amp;nbsp;C.2&lt;/ref&gt; which in physics is called a ''[[Field (physics)|field]]''.  Such a field is often called a ''field quantity'' in the literature, but is called a ''field'' here for clarity.  Several types of field (such as the [[electromagnetic field]]) meet the definition of a root-power quantity, whereas others (such as the [[Poynting vector]] and [[temperature]]) do not.  Conversely, not every root-power quantity is a field (such as the voltage on a [[loudspeaker]]).

One cubic foot of water is roughly 7.48 [[gallon]]s ( 6.25 Imperial Gallons). A Fixture Unit is used in plumbing design for both water supply and waste water.

Different fixtures have different flow requirements.  In order to determine the required size of pipe, an [[arbitrary unit]] is used for pipe sizing which takes into account the likelihood that all the fixtures will not be used at the same time.  This is called "fixture unit" (FU).  The relationship between gallons per minute (gpm) and fixture unit is not constant, but varies with the number of fixture units.  For example, 1000 FU is equivalent to 220 gpm, but 2000 FU is not double that, but is only 1.5 times as much, or 330 gpm.

Fixture unit values can be determined using charts from the [[International Plumbing Code]] or similar codes in local jurisdictions.

There are situations where a design provides for more FUs being discharged than being supplied. This occurs in situations where liquids may infiltrate or are added to a draining system, such as might happen in a large sports venue. Examples of how this could occur include rain water infiltration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2188">The '''Force Concept Inventory''' is a test measuring mastery of concepts commonly taught in a first semester of physics developed by [[David Hestenes|Hestenes]], Halloun, Wells, and Swackhamer (1985). It was the first such "[[concept inventory]]" and several others have been developed since for a variety of topics.&lt;ref name="Halloun and Hestenes"&gt;Hallouin, I. A., &amp; Hestenes, D.

Am. J. Phys. 66:465]&lt;/ref&gt; The FCI was designed to assess student understanding of the [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian]] concepts of force.  Hestenes (1998) found that while "nearly 80% of the [students completing introductory college physics courses] could state [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Third Law]] at the beginning of the course. FCI data showed that less than 15% of them fully understood it at the end". These results have been replicated in a number of studies involving students at a range of institutions (see sources section below), and have led to greater recognition in the [[physics education]] research community  of the importance of students' "active engagement" with the materials to be mastered.

== Gender differences ==
The FCI shows a gender difference in favor of males that has been the subject of some research in regard to gender equity in education. Men score on average about 10% higher.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Madsen, Sarah B. McKagan, Eleanor C. Sayre (2013).

'''''Fringe''''' is&lt;!--"is" is correct, the show suddenly hasn't started to cease existing after its last episode--&gt; an American [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series created by [[J. J. Abrams]], [[Alex Kurtzman]], and [[Roberto Orci]]. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on September 9, 2008, and concluded on January 18, 2013, after [[List of Fringe episodes|five seasons and 100 episodes]]. The series follows [[Olivia Dunham]] ([[Anna Torv]]), [[Peter Bishop]] ([[Joshua Jackson]]), and [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter Bishop]] ([[John Noble]]), all members of the fictional Fringe Division of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], based in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], under the supervision of [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]]. The team uses [[fringe science]] and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences, which are related to mysteries surrounding a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]].

The series has been described as a hybrid of fantasy, [[procedural drama]]s and [[Serial (radio and television)|serials]], influenced by film and television shows such as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Altered States]]'', and ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''. The series began as a traditional [[Villain of the week|mystery-of-the-week]] series and became more serialized in later seasons. Most episodes contain a standalone plot, with several others also exploring the series' overarching [[Mythology of Fringe|mythology]].

Critical reception was at first lukewarm but became more favorable after the first season, when the series began to explore its mythology, including parallel universes and [[Alternate history|alternate timelines]]. The show, as well as the cast and crew, were nominated for many major awards. Despite its move to the "[[Friday night death slot]]" and low [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], the series developed a [[cult following]]. It also spawned two six-part [[comic book]] series, an [[alternate reality game]], and three novels.

== Plot ==
{{Main|List of Fringe episodes|Mythology of Fringe}}
''Fringe'' follows the casework of the Fringe Division, a Joint Federal Task Force supported primarily by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], which includes Agent Olivia Dunham; Dr. Walter Bishop, the archetypal [[mad scientist]]; and Peter Bishop, Walter's estranged son and jack-of-all-trades. They are supported by Phillip Broyles ([[Lance Reddick]]), the force's director, and Agent Astrid Farnsworth ([[Jasika Nicole]]), who assists Walter in laboratory research. The Fringe Division investigates cases relating to [[fringe science]], ranging from [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] experiments gone wrong to the prospect of a destructive [[technological singularity]] to a possible collision of two [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]]. The Fringe Division's work often intersects with advanced biotechnology developed by a company called [[Massive Dynamic]], founded by Walter's former partner, Dr. William Bell ([[Leonard Nimoy]]), and run by their common friend, Nina Sharp ([[Blair Brown]]). The team is also watched silently by a group of bald, pale men who are called "Observers".

[[Fringe (season 1)|Season 1]] introduces the Fringe Division as they investigate cases that form "the Pattern" geographically centered around Reiden Lake in New York state, many of which are orchestrated by an international network of rogue scientists known as ZFT (''Zerstörung durch Fortschritte der Technologie'', or in English, Destruction through Advancement of Technology), led by [[List of Fringe characters#David Robert Jones|David Robert Jones]] ([[Jared Harris]]), who are preparing for a [[doomsday event]]. The ZFT threat appears to end when Peter kills Jones as he attempts travel to a parallel universe.&lt;ref name="season 1 finale"&gt;{{cite episode |episodelink=There's More Than One of Everything |title=There's More Than One of Everything |series=Fringe |credits=[[Brad Anderson (director)|Brad Anderson]] (director), [[Jeff Pinkner]] (teleplay), [[J.

In [[Fringe (season 2)|Season 2]], the occurrences are found to be in conjunction with activities of a parallel universe, which is plagued by [[gravitational singularity|singularities]] occurring at weakened points of the fabric between worlds; over there, scientists have developed an [[amber]]-like substance that isolates these singularities as well as any innocent people caught in the area on its release. The Fringe team deals with more cases that are leading to a "great storm" as the parallel universe appears to be at war with the prime one, engineered by human-machine hybrid [[shapeshifting|shapeshifters]] from the parallel universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Momentum Deferred |episodelink=Momentum Deferred |series=Fringe |credits=[[Joe Chappelle]] (director), [[Zack Stentz]] (writer), [[Ashley Miller (screenwriter)|Ashley Edward Miller]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2009-10-08 |season=2 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter is forced to tell Peter that he is from the parallel universe, a replacement for his own Peter, who died from a genetic disease. Walter had crossed over on the frozen ice of Reiden Lake in 1985 to administer the cure for the alternate version of Peter, but, after accidentally destroying a dose of the cure upon transport, he instead brought the boy across. On return, they fell through the ice but were saved by the Observer September ([[Michael Cerveris]]), who told Walter of the importance of "the boy", which Walter took to mean Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Peter |episodelink=Peter (Fringe) |series=Fringe |credits=[[David Straiton]] (director), [[Jeff Pinkner]] (teleplay/story), [[J.

[[Fringe (season 3)|Season 3]] presents episodes that alternate between the two universes. "Walternate", Walter's [[doppelgänger]] in the parallel universe, is the [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] and has set events in motion to assemble the Machine, a [[doomsday device]] that reacts only to Peter's biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Over There |episodelink=Over There (Fringe) |series=Fringe |credits=[[Akiva Goldsman]] (director/writer), [[Jeff Pinkner]] (writer) [[J.

Recovering in the present, Peter alters his plan and uses the Machine to merge the two rooms, creating a [[Einstein-Rosen bridge|bridge]] where inhabitants of both universes can solve their dilemma, before time is re-written so September (The Observer) doesn't save him and is forgotten by both Walter and Olivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Day We Died |episodelink=The Day We Died |series=Fringe |credits=[[Joe Chappelle]] (director), [[Jeff Pinkner]] (teleplay/story), [[J.

[[Fringe (season 4)|Season 4]] begins in an [[alternate history|alternate timeline]], one in which September had failed to save the alternate version of Peter in 1985, according to the Observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Neither Here Nor There |episodelink=Neither Here Nor There (Fringe) |series=Fringe |credits=[[Joe Chappelle]] (director), [[Jeff Pinkner]] (teleplay/story), [[J.

Peter is pulled into this new timeline due to the actions of the alternate timeline's Fringe team, which includes [[Lincoln Lee]] ([[Seth Gabel]]). Peter initially works to return to his own timeline, fueled by fears that his memories are altering Cortexiphan-dosed Olivia's of this timeline, but after encountering a wounded September, Peter comes to learn that this timeline is truly his home, and both he and Olivia come to accept the change, rekindling their affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=A Short Story About Love |episodelink=A Short Story About Love |series=Fringe |credits=[[J.

The Fringe division is forced to close the dimensional bridge, but this fails to stop Bell's plan. Walter is left with one choice, to shoot and kill Olivia, her death disrupting the process and saving the world. Olivia's "death" is only temporary, as the Cortexiphan in her body is consumed to repair the bullet wound, leaving her alive and healthy but lacking her psionic abilities. As Olivia and Peter begin their lives together, September appears to Walter and warns that the Observers "are coming".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Brave New World |episodelink=Brave New World (Fringe) |series=Fringe |credits=[[Joe Chappelle]] (director), [[Jeff Pinkner]] (writer), [[J.

The [[Fringe (season 5)|fifth and final season]] begins in 2036, following from the flash-forward fourth-season episode "Letters of Transit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/livefrom/post/2012/07/fringe-stars-fans-feel-the-love-going-into-final-season/1 |title='Fringe' stars, fans feel the love going into final season |first=Brian |last=Truitt |date=2012-07-15 |accessdate=2012-07-16 |work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As September warned, Observers from the far future, having ruined Earth for themselves, time-traveled to 2015 and instituted "The Purge", wiped out much of humanity, subjected the survivors to their control, and began modifying the planet's environment to be more suitable for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Letters of Transit |episodelink=Letters of Transit |series=Fringe |credits=[[Joe Chappelle]] (director), [[Akiva Goldsman]] (writer), [[J. H. Wyman]] (writer), [[Jeff Pinkner]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2012-04-20 |season=4 |number=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fringe team was able to seal themselves in amber to avoid capture shortly after the Purge, and are reunited through Henrietta ("Etta") ([[Georgina Haig]]), Peter and Olivia's now adult daughter who disappeared shortly after the Observer arrival in 2015. Walter reveals he and September developed a plan to defeat the Observers, revealed through a series of pre-recorded videotapes ambered in the lab. The tapes lead to several components of a device, including a young Observer child, named Michael ([[Spencer List|Spencer List in Season 1]] and Rowan Longworth in Season 5), but further allude to a man named Donald that had helped Walter prepare the plan. Etta is killed during these events, driving Olivia and Peter to complete the plan for her sake. Through Michael, they discover Donald is September, having been stripped of his Observer powers for helping the Fringe team, and that Michael is his genetic son, having been purposely grown as an anomaly in the far future. September explains the plan is to send Michael to the year 2167, where human genetic experiments to sacrifice emotion for intelligence would be started and leading to the creation of the Observers; by showing them Michael, who possesses both emotion and intelligence, the experiments would be stopped and the Observers never created. September is prepared to take Michael to the future as the plan is set in motion, but he is shot and killed at the last moment; Walter, already made aware that he will have to make a sacrifice, takes Michael through to the future to assure the plan's completion. As predicted, time is reset from the invasion onwards in 2015; the Observers never invade, and Peter, Olivia, and Etta, live their lives peacefully—though Peter receives one final letter from his father: a drawing of a white tulip.

===Parallel universe===
[[File:Fringe-Manhatan.jpg|thumb|One of ''Fringe''{{'}}s location titles. In this example, from "[[Olivia (Fringe)|Olivia]]", the episode takes place in the alternate universe's version of Manhattan, whose name is spelled with only one T. One notable difference in the alternate universe is that while the [[September 11 attacks]] occurred, the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] towers were not destroyed.]]
Much of the [[story arc]] for ''Fringe'' involves an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] that mostly mirrors the prime universe, but with numerous historical idiosyncrasies.  A significant example element used is the effect of the [[September 11 attacks]]; though this event also occurred in the alternate universe, the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] was untouched by the attacks, leaving the buildings as predominant landmarks in the alternate world's skyline of "Manhatan"&lt;!--This is not a typo: The name of the alternate version of Manhattan is spelled in this manner within the series. See the image and caption nearby.--&gt;. The South Tower was used as the office of William Bell in several episodes.&lt;ref name="nypost over there"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/fringe_goes_over_there_12Ox7WzL8z9ScVrYbYFpHM |title='Fringe' goes over there |first=Maxine |last=Shen |date=2010-10-30 |accessdate=2010-12-19 |work=[[New York Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blastr.com/2010/09/get-ready-for-weird-freak.php |title=A sneak peek at tonight's season 3 Fringe debut |publisher=[[Blastr]] |last=Huddleston |first=Kathie |date=2010-09-23 |accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The producers were strongly interested in "[[worldbuilding|world building]]," and the alternate universe allowed them to create a very similar world with a large amount of detail to fill in the texture of the world. An alternate universe also allowed them to show "how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line," according to co-director [[Jeff Pinkner]].&lt;ref name="nypost over there"/&gt; However, the producers also realized the concept of the alternate universe could be confusing to viewers. To avoid this, elements of the world were introduced in small pieces over the course of the first two seasons before the larger revelation in the second-season finale and the third season. [[J.H.

=== Glyph code ===
[[File:Fringe leaf.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Marketing posters used to promote the series often featured one of the glyphs used in the show's interstitial, each being a twist on a common image. Pictured here is a leaf with an embedded Greek capital letter delta.]]
Prior to commercial breaks, a brief image of a [[glyph]] is shown. Abrams revealed in an interview that the glyphs had a hidden meaning. "It's something that we're doing for people who care to figure it out and follow it, but it's not something that a viewer has to consider when they watch the show."&lt;ref name="mystery"&gt;{{cite web |first=Fred |last=Topel |url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/J.J.+Abrams+on+TV%27s+Fringe/ |title=J.J.

In "[[Jacksonville (Fringe)|Jacksonville]]", behind Walter as he speaks to Olivia about her treatment where the [[nootropic]] Cortexiphan was first studied as a trial, each of the glyphs is clearly visible on the daycare wall. An episode-by-episode key to the various glyphs was made available on [[Fringepedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Julian |last=Sanchez |title=Solution to the Fringe Glyph Cipher |date=2009-04-07 |url=http://www.juliansanchez.com/2009/04/07/solution-to-the-fringe-glyph-cipher/ |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opening sequence ===
The show's standard opening sequence interplays images of the glyph symbols alongside words representing fringe science topics, such as "teleportation" and "dark matter". Within the third season, with episodes that took place primarily in the parallel universe, a new set of titles was used, following a similar format, though tinted red instead of blue and using alternate fringe science concepts like "hypnosis" and "neuroscience". The difference in color has led some fans to call the prime universe the Blue one in contrast to the parallel Red one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2010/10/15/fringe_season_3_episode_4_recap_open2010/ |title="Fringe" recap: Two shapeshifters revealed |publisher=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2011-06-05 |first=Jessie |last=Link}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third-season episode "[[Entrada (Fringe)|Entrada]]", the titles used a mix of both the blue- and red-tinted versions, given that the episode took place equally in each universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/12/02/fringe-entrada-season-3-episode-8/#more-13648 |title='Fringe' recap: 'Entrada' and exits, lives saved and lost |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Ken |last=Tucker |authorlink=Ken Tucker |date=2010-12-02 |accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the two flashback episodes, "[[Peter (Fringe)|Peter]]" and "[[Subject 13]]," a variation on the sequence, using retro graphics akin to 1980s technology and phrases like "personal computing" and "genetic engineering," was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/peter,39772/ |title=Peter |first=Noel |last=Murray |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2011-06-05 |publisher=[[The A.V.

==Development==

===Conception===
Co-created by [[J. J. Abrams]], [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]], ''Fringe'' is produced by [[Bad Robot]] in association with [[Warner Bros. Television]], as part of a commitment that Abrams previously made with the studio.&lt;ref name="nytimes creation"/&gt; At the time, Abrams was working with Orci and Kurtzman on the ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film, and met at one of the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]]s during ''Star Trek''{{'}}s production to brainstorm ideas for the show.&lt;ref name="nytimes creation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt1"/&gt; Abrams later brought [[Bryan Burk]], a producer on several of his films, to help with developing the series.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt1"/&gt;

Abrams's inspiration for ''Fringe'' came from a range of sources, including the writings of [[Michael Crichton]], the film ''[[Altered States]]'', films by [[David Cronenberg]], and the television series ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''.&lt;ref name="nytimes creation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hibberd |first=James |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/live-feed/jj-abrams-fringe-isnt-inspired-50508 |title=J.J.

Though the team saw this as a way of presenting "mystery of the week"-type episodes, they wanted to focus more on how these stories were told in unpredictable ways rather than the actual mystery, recognizing that most of their target audience has seen such mysteries before through previous shows and films.&lt;ref name="sfw interview"/&gt; Instead, they wanted their storytelling to be original and unexpected, and, as claimed by Kurtzman, one of the most challenging aspects of developing the individual episodes.&lt;ref name="sfw interview"/&gt; Serialization of the show was important to tell their overall story with larger plot elements, but Abrams recognized the difficulties that his earlier serialized shows, such as ''Lost'' and ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', had in attracting and maintaining viewers that had not seen these shows from the start or who missed episodes sporadically.&lt;ref name="nytimes creation"/&gt; For ''Fringe'', Abrams instead sought to create, as stated by David Itzkoff of the ''[[New York Times]]'', "a show that suggested complexity but was comprehensible in any given episode".&lt;ref name="nytimes creation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt1"/&gt; The writers aimed to balance a line between stand-alone episodes, a factor requested by Fox, and a heavily serialized show; they balanced these by moving the serialization aspect to the growth and development of their characters. This gave them the ability to write self-contained episodes that still contained elements related to the overall mythos.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt1"/&gt; However, as production continued, the creative staff found the show itself took on a more serialized nature and opted towards this approach in later seasons while still balancing self-contained episodes.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt1"/&gt;

One method was by introducing overarching themes that individual episodes could be tied to, such as "The Pattern" in Season 1, providing information repeatedly about the larger plot over the course of several episodes or seasons.&lt;ref name="nytimes creation"/&gt; Abrams also created characters whose alliances to the larger narrative were clear, avoiding a similar problem that had occurred during the first and second seasons of ''Alias''.&lt;ref name="nytimes creation"/&gt;  A final step taken was to script out all of the major long-running plot elements, including the show's finale, prior to full-time production.  Abrams contrasted this to the process used in ''Lost'', where ideas like character flashbacks and the hatch from the second season were introduced haphazardly and made difficulties in defining when they should be presented to the viewers. Instead, with ''Fringe'', they were able to create "clearly defined goalposts" (in Itzkoff's words) that could be altered as necessary with network and seasonal changes but always provided a clear target for the overarching plot.&lt;ref name="nytimes creation"/&gt; These approaches also allowed the team to introduce unique plot elements to be introduced in time that would have altered the show's fate if known at the start. Abrams stated that "There are certain details that are hugely important that I believe, if shared, will destroy any chance of actually getting on the air."&lt;ref name="nytimes creation"/&gt; Abrams noted that they are able to benefit from "how open Fox as a network has been to a show that is embracing the weirdness and the long-term stories that we want to tell".&lt;ref name="sfw interview"/&gt; During the third season, executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that "We have six to eight seasons worth of material. We see it as having certain chapters that would enrich the overall story, but aren't necessary to tell the overall story. God willing, the network allows us the time to tell our complete story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/fringe_exec_producer_plays_what_yv7SH4w54J8dQz1Nu0LWtM |title='Fringe' exec producer plays 'What If?' |first=Jarret |last=Wieselmann |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-03-09 |work=[[New York Post]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307023050/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/fringe_exec_producer_plays_what_yv7SH4w54J8dQz1Nu0LWtM |archivedate=2011-03-07 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the larger story, the writers have placed elements in earlier episodes that are referenced in episodes seasons later. For example, in the first-season episode "[[The Ghost Network]]", the Fringe team encounters an amber-like substance, which is later shown to be a critical means to combat the breakdown of the parallel universe and eventually for the same in the prime universe with the third-season episode "[[6B (Fringe)|6B]]".&lt;ref name="ign march2011 part2"/&gt; Pinkner compared this aspect to "planting seeds", some which they know how they plan to use later in the show's story, while others they can find ways of incorporating into these later episodes.&lt;ref name="ign march2011 part2"/&gt;

He further attributed these elements as part of the "world building" to flesh out the show beyond episodic content.&lt;ref name="ign march2011 part2"/&gt; The producers have stated that when the show's mythology is introduced, it is not simply there to tie episodes together, but "to provide answers that generate consequences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/02/fringe-mythology/ |title='Big Answer' Looms in Fringe's Mythology-Rich Winter Finale |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |first=Hugh |last=Hart |date=2010-02-04 |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain elements of the show's mythology were established from the start. The parallel universe was always part of the original concept, though aspects of when and how to introduce it were tackled as the show proceeded.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Fringe-Series-Finale-Oral-History-Abrams-Jackson-Torv-Noble-1059176.aspx |title=Fringe Oral History: Dual Universes Open Up a New World Of Possibility |first=Natalie |last=Abrams |date=2013-01-15 |accessdate=2013-01-17 |work=[[TV Guide]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of Peter being from the parallel universe came early into the show's production, but this came to lead the team to jokingly refer to Peter as their "hatch", one of the early mysteries in ''Lost'', as with the hatch in ''Lost'', they initially had no idea how to introduce this within the show.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt2"/&gt; FOX's Reilly was also initially concerned about the parallel universe aspect, but as the show progressed into the first season and found its groove, the concept was readily accepted.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt2"/&gt; The most poignant introduction of the parallel universe was in the conclusion of the first-season finale, "[[There's More Than One of Everything]]", where they showed the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] were still standing in the parallel universe, a concept introduced by writer [[Andrew Kreisberg]] as an iconic image to leave viewers with; Jackson stated, "I don't know that we've ever had a better visual or a better cliff-hanger."&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt2"/&gt;

Other mythos elements were devised as the series progressed. The writers had originally envisioned only spending small portions of episodes within the parallel universe, but as they wrote these episodes within Season 3, they brought out the idea of setting entire episodes within the parallel universe.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt2"/&gt; This necessitated the development of the alternate versions of the main characters, which Pinkner considered "a great playground just for imagination".&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt2"/&gt; The actors themselves found this concept exciting, as it allowed them to play different characters but with the same background and considered it a creative challenge.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt2"/&gt; Similarly, having Peter erased from the timeline as part of the finale for Season 3 was an idea that grew over the course of that season.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Fringe-Series-Finale-Oral-History-Abrams-Jackson-Torv-Noble-1059208.aspx |title=Fringe Oral History: How the Series Changed Forever with One Sacrificial Act |first=Natalie |last=Abrams |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-01-17 |work=[[TV Guide]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers were aware this would be a risky move but felt the idea was very appropriate for ''Fringe'', and opted to write towards this after considering all the consequences.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt3"/&gt; Pinkner noted that this gave them an opportunity to "reset the character relationships" and determine the key aspects that would remain without Peter, as well as "making the audience uncomfortable at times".&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt3"/&gt; The cast was not initially sold with the idea, but came around as the fourth season progressed.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt3"/&gt;

After developing the core concepts of the show, Abrams began to seek studios to develop the show; Abrams' past successes led to Warner Bros. Television and the Fox Television Network to quickly jump on board the project. [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]], the chief executive of Warner Bros. Television, had been actively seeking to bring any Abrams' project to his studio, and heard Abrams' pitch for ''Fringe'' at a dinner meeting in August 2007.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt1"/&gt; Similarly, [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]], the entertainment chairman at Fox, knew that it was critical for him to bring the next Abrams' project to his network, and worked with Roth to assure this would happen.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt1"/&gt;

[[Jeff Pinkner]] was selected to act as the head [[showrunner]] and [[executive producer]]. Abrams noted that he trusts Pinkner after working together with him on ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' and ''Lost''.&lt;ref name="Jeff Pinkner Showrunner"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=43831 |title=Pinker Reunites with Abrams for Fringe |publisher=Comingsoon.net |date=2008-04-09 |accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinkner became interested in the show during a visit to the set of ''Star Trek'', during which Abrams was discussing the concept of ''Fringe'' with Orci and Kurtzman, knowing that they would not be involved in the direct production of the work. Abrams pitched the idea to Pinkner, who was intrigued by the importance of characters in a science fiction drama.&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt1"/&gt; In season two, J.H. Wyman was brought on as executive producer and showrunner with Pinkner. Wyman had been a science fiction enthusiast but had worried that he had not written anything in that genre but after learning about the concept of the show, felt his role as an executive producer was "a match made in heaven".&lt;ref name="tvguide oralhistory pt1"/&gt;

[[Michael Giacchino]], Abrams' frequent collaborator, composed the music for the pilot of ''Fringe'', before handing over duties to his assistants Chad Seiter and [[Chris Tilton]]; Tilton took over scoring duties from Season 2 onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007651?refCatId=3703 |title=Composing: a collaborative process |work=Variety |first=Matt |last=Hurwitz |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Giacchino retains an on-screen credit, Abrams himself wrote the series theme music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/05/pinkner-and-wyman-the-evil-geniuses-behind-fringe.html |title=Pinkner and Wyman: the Evil Geniuses behind 'Fringe' |date=2010-05-20 |accessdate=2011-03-31 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Andrew |last=Hanson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2009, it was reported that in the event that ''Fringe'' would be renewed for a second season, the show would move production to [[Vancouver]] from [[New York City]] as a cost-cutting measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Soll |first=Lindsay |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2009/02/21/fringe-fox/ |title='Fringe' moves production to Canada |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2009-02-21 |accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producer Jeff Pinkner explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We want to stay in New York, New York has been incredibly good to us. It feels like we're being kicked out of the city. I know we're not, but they're making it impossible for us to afford doing the show ... Our New York crew is spectacular, they've worked their [butts] off to make the show look great. But it looks like New York is not renewing a tax credit that makes it possible to make our budget in New York. So it looks like, out of necessity, we'll have to leave New York, which is not anything we are welcoming.&lt;ref name="chicago tribune"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/fringe-fox-observer-jones.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429034831/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/fringe-fox-observer-jones.html |archivedate=2009-04-29 |title=Keeping up with Mr. Jones: Details on 'Fringe's' future |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prior to the start of production for the fifth season, Pinkner announced that he was leaving the production of the show to pursue other projects; Wyman would remain as the sole showrunner for the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fringe-jeff-pinkner-exit-339349 |title='Fringe' Co-Showrunner Jeff Pinkner Exits for Final Season |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2012-06-19 |accessdate=2012-06-20 |first=Philiana |last=Ng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Casting ===
The show's main characters, Olivia, Peter, and Walter, were core of the concept for ''Fringe''. The creators recognized early that "the idea that telling a father-son story and a relationship story was a really compelling one and a very accessible one", according to Kurtzman.&lt;ref name="sfw interview"/&gt; They were able to provide the characters with backstories that, like with other long-term plot elements, could be alluded to over several episodes and seasons.&lt;ref name="sfw interview"/&gt;

The characters would also contrast with the typical procedural genre show; rather than having clearly defined roles episode to episode, they instead "have an emotional memory and an emotional investment", as stated by Orci.&lt;ref name="sfw interview"/&gt; This also allowed for, as necessary, characters to be removed or introduced to the show and have a larger impact on the other characters.&lt;ref name="sfw interview"/&gt;

The first actors cast were [[Kirk Acevedo]] and [[Mark Valley]], who portrayed FBI agents Charlie Francis and John Scott, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/lost/new-abrams-series-fringe-gets-15747.aspx |title=New Abrams Series 'Fringe' Gets Two Cast Members |publisher=Buddy TV |first=Oscar |last=Dahl |date=2008-01-17 |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=TV Guide News |title=J.J.

On April 8, 2009, it was announced that [[Leonard Nimoy]] would appear as Walter Bishop's former lab partner, Dr. William Bell in the first season's finale, which explores the existence of an ominous [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]].

== Reception ==
Early reception through the first season was generally lukewarm, with many noting it's "lackluster" start and the "dullness" of the characters. However, changes in the approach and storytelling of the show in the second and subsequent seasons led to more positive critical reception and made it a media favorite. As a whole, the series was well received by the critics and has developed a [[cult following]].&lt;ref name="avclub 2016"/&gt;

In its ''2008 Year in Review'', [[Television Without Pity]] declared ''Fringe'' one of the year's biggest TV disappointments, commenting that the show is "entertaining" and "the cast is largely strong" but the character development is insufficient, and describing main character Olivia Dunham as "wooden and distant." &lt;ref name="TV W/O Pity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/year_in_review/year_in_review_2008_biggest_tv.php |title=Year in Review 2008: Biggest TV Disappointments |work=[[Television Without Pity]] |accessdate=2008-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217062113/http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/year_in_review/year_in_review_2008_biggest_tv.php |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, in other articles recounting the best and worst of 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that ''Fringe'' "is the best of a rash of new series that toy with the paranormal". The author goes on to praise the cast saying that "Much credit belongs to Anna Torv who stars as an F.B.I. agent investigating bizarre murders that all appear to be linked to a powerful and mysterious multinational corporation", and "Ms. Torv is backed up ably by John Noble as a crazy but brilliant fringe scientist and his level-headed but skeptical son, played by Joshua Jackson".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/arts/television/21stan.html?_r=1 |title=Politics Gets the Entertainment Vote |first=Alessandra |last=Stanley |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2008-12-19 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent seasons===
Seasons of ''Fringe'' after the first season were seen as vast improvements on the first.&lt;ref name="avclub 2016"/&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated, "The best new show of the year took a few weeks to grow on me, but now it's a full-blown addiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20162677_20164091_20247252_3,00.html |title=10 Best TV Shows of 2008: Ken Tucker's Picks |authorlink=Ken Tucker |first=Ken |last=Tucker |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2008-12-19 |accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Walter Bishop one of the best characters of 2008, noting, "the role of the modern-day mad scientist could so easily have been a disaster, but the 'Fringe' writers and the masterful John Noble have conspired to create a character that seems, as trite as it sounds, more Shakespearean than sci-fi."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-laca..templatelibrary.a.ar3-2008dec21,0,2123740.story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130052603/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-laca..templatelibrary.a.ar3-2008dec21%2C0%2C2123740.story |title=Grateful for 'Life,' 'In Treatment,' 'Dexter' ... |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2008-12-21 |accessdate=2011-05-22 |archivedate=2009-01-30 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' stated that some episodes are "distressingly predictable and formulaic" but adds that there have also been some excellent episodes.&lt;ref name="chicago tribune"/&gt; The ''New York Times'' named ''Fringe'' one of the top 10 television shows in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/arts/television/19hale.html?_r=1 |title=Cartoons, Quarterbacks and Comedians |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2010-12-19 |accessdate=2010-12-19 |first=Mike |last=Hale}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while Television Without Pity, previously dismissive of the show, listed it amongst their 2010 "Most Memorable TV Moments", stating "there were so many great Fringe moments this year" and "we were treated to some of the best sci-fi on television this past fall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/year_in_review/year_in_review_2010_most_memor.php |title=Year in Review 2010: Most Memorable TV Moments |work=Television Without Pity |accessdate=2011-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624052452/http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/year_in_review/year_in_review_2010_most_memor.php |archivedate=2011-06-24 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The A.V. Club]]'' named ''Fringe'' the 15th best show of 2010, stated that the episode "Peter" gave "the series' overarching storyline a devastating emotional core", making the series a "rare blend of inventive ideas, wild ambition, and unexpected soulfulness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-25-best-television-series-of-2010,49229/ |title=The 25 best television series of 2010 |date=2010-12-20 |accessdate=2010-12-20 |publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] named ''Fringe'' the 18th best science fiction show of all time in a 2011 listing, stating that since the middle of the first season, "it's been nothing but a series of satisfyingly jaw-dropping 'holy eff!' moments layered with wonderful, nuanced performances from Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson and John Noble".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/114/1143800p1.html |title=Top 50 Sci-Fi TV Shows |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2011-02-23 |publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''Entertainment Weekly'' listed the show at #17 in the "25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years", saying, "''Fringe'' was conceived as a mass-appeal genre procedural, with a background mythology that wouldn't detract from [[Villain of the week|monster-of-the-week]] episodes. ... But the mythology overtook the monsters following the revelation of a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]. By its third season, ''Fringe'' was overpopulated by multiple versions of every character. Unfortunately, that increasing narrative complexity has steadily pigeonholed it as a niche show."&lt;ref&gt;"25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years." ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. August 3, 2012, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'' declared "[[White Tulip]]" as "one of the greatest hours in television history". He wrote, "'White Tulip' is an hour of television that shouldn't work, that technically doesn't even exist ... but thank god it does, because it's one of the most powerful episodes ever created — and it showcases why ''Fringe'' is one of the most criminally underrated series of our time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/107950-why-fringe-season-2-episode-white-tulip-is-one-of-the-greatest-hours-in-television-history |title=Why 'Fringe' Season 2 Episode "White Tulip" Is One Of The Greatest Hours In Television History |first=Jefferson |last=Grubbs |work=Bustle |date=2015-10-10 |accessdate=2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fringe'' premiered in the [[2008–09 United States network television schedule|2008 United States television season]] at a regular timeslot of 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern on Tuesdays.  During Season 1, ''Fringe'' was part of a Fox initiative known as "Remote-Free TV". Episodes of ''Fringe'' were longer than standard dramas on current network television. The show ran with half the commercials, adding about six minutes to the show's runtime.&lt;ref name="Remote Free"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117985767?refCatId=1300 |title=New Fox dramas to limit commercials |accessdate=2008-05-18 |last=Schneider |first=Michael |date=2008-05-15 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the show went to a commercial, a short bumper aired informing the viewer of roughly how much time commercials would consume before the program resumed. The pilot episode was leaked via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]], three months before the series premiere; similar to leaked fellow Fox series ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2008/06/fringe-pilot-le/ |title=Fringe Pilot Leaks Online Three Months Before Premiere |accessdate=2008-09-16 |last=Jenna |first=Wortham |date=2008-06-17 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was renewed for a second season on May 4, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Seidman |first=Robert |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2009/05/04/fox-renews-fringe/17977 |title=FOX renews Fringe for a full second season |publisher=TV by the Numbers |date=2009-05-04 |accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Thursday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/983/983821p1.html |title=Fringe Moves to Risky Timeslot; Dollhouse Stays Put on Fridays |publisher=IGN |first=Eric |last=Goldman |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This timeslot, commonly considered the "[[Friday night death slot]]" for several previous Fox shows due to cancellation shortly following the move to that slot, left critics considering the show's fate.  While ''The X-Files'' originally premiered during this slot and would continue to be a highly successful series, critics were unsure if ''Fringe'' could duplicate this performance.  In this slot, the show competed with ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', a series that attracts similar types of viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/113/1135956p1.html |title=Fringe's Scary New Timeslot |first=Eric |last=Goldman |date=2010-11-19 |accessdate=2010-11-19 |publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox's Entertainment President [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]], in response to these concerns, stated that 45% of ''Fringe''{{'}}s viewership is from [[time shifting]] recording through digital video receivers, and does not expect the viewership numbers to change significantly with the change to Friday. Reilly further postulated that "If it does anywhere near what it did on Thursdays, we can glue that show to the schedule because it can be a big win for us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/11/22/fox-execs-on-american-idol-fringe-moves-its-the-right-moment/ |title=Fox execs on 'American Idol,' 'Fringe' moves: 'It's the right moment' |first=Lynette |last=Rice |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2010-11-30 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further promoted by the critical reaction to the rescheduling, the Fox network created a self-deprecating promotional advertisement acknowledging the reputation of the time slot, including quotes from other media outlets concerned about the move, but asserted that the move would "re-animate" the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/12/fringe_friday_time_slot.html |title=Fox Markets Fringe With New 'Friday Death Slot' Ad |first=Kyle |last=Buchaan |date=2010-12-14 |accessdate=2010-12-16 |work=[[New York Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/12/16/fringe-exclusive-friday-promo-deathslot/ |title='Fringe' exclusive: Fox execs on its 'deathslot'-spoofing promo and plans to attract new viewers |first=Jeff |last=Jensen |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2010-12-16 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network also created a music video, set to "[[Echoes (Klaxons song)|Echoes]]" by the band [[Klaxons]] as a means of summarizing the third season to date prior to the first Friday broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/01/18/exclusive-fringe-music-video-echoes/ |title=Watch the 'Fringe' music video 'Echoes' -- EXCLUSIVE |first=Jeff |last=Jensen |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2011-01-18 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joshua Jackson, who plays Peter Bishop on the show, cautioned that time-shifted viewership may not be enough to save the show: "It's not that not enough people are watching ''Fringe'', it's that not enough people are watching ''Fringe'' during the hour that it's on the air, which is key for the network."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-01-21/entertainment/27096167_1_fbi-agent-olivia-dunham-fringe-show |title=Joshua Jackson returns with new season of 'Fringe' hoping to soldify show's uncertain future |first=Ethan |last=Sacks |date=2011-01-21 |accessdate=2011-01-21 |work=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's first episode at the Friday 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. timeslot ("[[The Firefly (Fringe)|The Firefly]]") scored a 1.9 in the key 18–49 demographic which was an increase of 12% over its last Thursday-aired episode ("Marionette") which scored a 1.7,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Gorman |date=January 22, 2011 |work=TV by the Numbers |title=Updated TV Ratings Friday: 'Fringe' Premieres Up, 'Medium' Series Finale Rises, 'Kitchen Nightmares' Starts Well |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/01/22/tv-ratings-friday-fringe-premieres-up/79750 |accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained similar numbers in the second week for "[[Reciprocity (Fringe)|Reciprocity]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/01/29/updated-tv-ratings-friday-fringe-holds-steady-kitchen-nightmares-down/80704 |title=Updated TV Ratings Friday: 'Fringe' Holds Steady, 'Kitchen Nightmares' Down |first=Robert |last=Seidman |date=2011-01-29 |accessdate=2011-01-29 |publisher=TV by the Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though viewership slipped in further weeks, the show was renewed for a fourth season in March 2011. The move was unexpected based on these ratings, given the past performance of shows with similar viewership numbers in the Friday night slot, but several critics attribute it to the strong fanbase that the show has garnered, which contributes in part to consistently higher time-shifted viewership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-28/entertainment/fringe.ratings.go_1_science-fiction-fans-licorice-low-ratings?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title='Fringe' renewed: Can fan passion trump |first=Henry |last=Hanks |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2011-03-30 |publisher=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423124637/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-28/entertainment/fringe.ratings.go_1_science-fiction-fans-licorice-low-ratings?_s=PM%3ASHOWBIZ |archivedate=2011-04-23 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox's Reilly stated that:

Reilly further added that the renewal was also prompted by the high risk of trying to replace ''Fringe'' with another show with unknown viewership metrics; he commented that they "have a far better shot of sticking with a show that has an audience that [they] think [they] can grow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2011-04-01-SOS01_CV_N.htm |title=Save our shows!

Before the renewal of the fifth season, Abrams stated some skepticism for a renewal opportunity, but hoped that if it was cancelled, that it may be picked up by another network. On the other hand, Abrams considered that if Fox did pick up the show for a fifth season, "the next year would be the great ending for the show".&lt;ref name="ign 5th season"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/121/1216068p1.html |title=Fringe: J.J.

We lose a lot of money on the show."&lt;ref name="ign 5th season"/&gt; Reilly further reiterated the dedication of the fans of the show for helping it to its fourth season and continued success.&lt;ref name="ign 5th season"/&gt; When asked about whether the writers would have enough notice to write the fourth-season finale as a series finale if necessary, Reilly stated, "That's a [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]] issue" (chief executive of [[Warner Bros.

Television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for the show to allow a fifth season to occur; this would not only help Fox reduce its losses on the show, but would also bring the total number of episodes above 100, giving Warner Bros. a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2012/01/22/fringe-season-5-renewal-cancellation/ |title=Fringe Update: Season 5 Discussions Underway, J.J.

''Fringe'' premiered in Canada on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] simultaneous to its U.S. premiere and was the most watched program in Canada that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/nat09082008.pdf |title=Top Programs – Total Canada (English) September 8–14, 2008 |publisher=[[BBM Canada]] |date=2008-09-19 |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706165054/http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/nat09082008.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show would fluctuate between airing on CTV and [[A (TV system)|A]] during its first two seasons.

A version of the show (edited for time) premiered on the [[Nine Network]] in Australia on September 17, 2008. In the season one episode "[[In Which We Meet Mr. Jones]]", the opening scene where doctors discover a parasite on Detective Loeb's heart was cut, going straight to the opening credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Fringe - Series Premiere - Wednesday, September 17 AT 8:30PM on Nine |url=http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/enews/nine/FRINGE---SERIES-PREMIERE---WEDNESDAY-SEPTEMBER-17-AT-8-30PM-ON-NINE-040908.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221090030/http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/enews/nine/FRINGE---SERIES-PREMIERE---WEDNESDAY-SEPTEMBER-17-AT-8-30PM-ON-NINE-040908.html |archivedate=2009-02-21 |publisher=[[Nine Network]] |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nine Network later dropped the show from its primetime schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/10/gone-fringe.html |title=Gone: ''Fringe'' |author=Knox, David |date=2008-10-17 |publisher=TV Tonight |accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was temporary as the show returned during the December to January non-ratings period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/nine-switches-fringe-episodes.html |title=Nine switches Fringe episodes |author=Knox, David |date=2008-12-03 |publisher=TV Tonight |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series later moved to Nine's digital multi-channel, [[GO!

With 13 episodes in its final season, ''Fringe'' has a total of 100 episodes, a critical number for syndication deals for Warner Bros., and considered part of the reason for the show's final renewal.

Unfortunately, this means that we will have some delays, but will be back in January."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/100810-Fringe-Delay.html |title=DC's 'Fringe' Comic Delayed Until January |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |last=Brady |first=Matt |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1652">'''Gerasimos D. Danilatos''' (also known as Gerry D. Danilatos) (born circa 1946) is a Greek-Australian [[physicist]] and inventor of [[ESEM]], the environmental scanning electron microscope.

He was born in [[Cefalonia]], Greece. After the [[1953 Ionian earthquake]], his family moved to [[Patras]], where he attended elementary and high school.

After high school and military service, he graduated from the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]] and completed his physics degree with distinction. In 1972, he emigrated to Australia, and got married in 1979. He received his Ph.D. from the [[University of New South Wales]] in January 1978 after completing his Thesis on "dynamic mechanical properties of keratin fibres". As a scientist at the same university, he then developed the environmental  scanning electron microscope ([[ESEM#History|ESEM]]),  after prior attempts by other workers to examine wet specimens under the electron beam.  For the most part, he received financial support from the [[Australian Wool Corporation]] until 1986. In 2003, he received the Ernst Abbe Memorial Award from the [[New York Microscopical Society]] for his lifetime achievements.

An '''Information School''' (sometimes abbreviated '''I-school''' or '''iSchool''') is a [[university]]-level institution committed to understanding the role of [[information]] in nature and human endeavors. Synonyms include "School of Information", "Department of Information Studies", or "Information Department". Information Schools [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] conduct research into the fundamental aspects of information and [[Information technology|related technologies]].  In addition to granting [[academic degree]]s, information schools educate information professionals, researchers, and scholars for an [[Information revolution|increasingly information-driven world]]. 

Information school can also refer, in a more restricted sense, to the [[List of Information Schools|members of the iSchools organization]] (formerly the "iSchools Project"), as governed by the iCaucus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ischools.org/site/about_icaucus/ About the iCaucus, governing body of the iSchools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928172227/http://www.ischools.org/site/about_icaucus/ |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ischools.org/site/ischoolsnews_article/the_ischools_welcome_nanjing_and_tampere_as_new_additions_now_boast_33_memb/ The iSchools Welcome Nanjing and Tampere as New Additions; Now Boast 33 Members Worldwide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204074445/http://www.ischools.org/site/ischoolsnews_article/the_ischools_welcome_nanjing_and_tampere_as_new_additions_now_boast_33_memb/ |date=2011-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this group share a fundamental interest in the relationships between people, information, technology, and science.  These schools, colleges, and departments have been either newly established or have evolved from programs focused on [[information systems]], [[library science]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[computer science]], [[library and information science]] and [[information science]].
 
Information schools promote an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the opportunities and challenges of [[information management]], with a core commitment to concepts like [[Universal design|universal access]] and [[User-centered design|user-centered]] organization of information. The field is concerned broadly with questions of design and preservation across information spaces, from digital and virtual spaces like online communities, the World Wide Web, and databases to physical spaces such as libraries, museums, archives, and other repositories. Information school degree programs include course offerings in areas such as  [[information architecture]], [[Information design|design]],  [[Information economics|economics]], [[Information policy|policy]], [[Information retrieval|retrieval]], [[Information security|security]], and [[telecommunication]]s; [[knowledge management]], [[user experience design]], and [[usability]]; [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] and [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]], including [[digital preservation]]; librarianship and [[Library management|library administration]]; the [[Information society|sociology of information]]; and [[human–computer interaction]].

This is a '''list of Charadriiformes species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields.

[[Charadriiformes]] (Charadrius being Latin for ''"plover"'') is the taxonomic order to which the [[wader]]s, [[gull]]s, and [[auk]]s belong. [[BirdLife International]] has assessed 352 species; 181 (51% of total species) have had their population estimated. Bird taxonomy is currently in a state of flux, much wider in scope than the complications arising from the realization that [[Origin of birds|birds are dinosaurs]], and a full scientific consensus on the division of orders has yet to be settled upon.&lt;ref name='flux'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://john-boyd.com/Taxo/taxo2.html | title = Aves—A Taxonomy in Flux 2.11 : Modern Birds | accessdate = 2012-12-24 | last = Boyd | first = John H. | publisher = [[Florida International University]] | date = 25 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charadriiformes, for example, are grouped with the [[Ciconiiformes]] in the [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]].&lt;ref name='sibley'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scricciolo.com/classificazione/sequence.htm | title = Sibley's Sequence : Based on DNA hybridization comparisons by Charles Gald Sibley - Burt L. Monroe, Jr. | accessdate = 2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interest of standardization this article, along with the rest of the Wikipedia Bird Population lists, is split along the taxonomic system used by BirdLife, which is both the Earth's largest partnership of conservation organizations, and the assessment team for birds on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name='About BirdLife'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/index.html | title = About BirdLife | accessdate = 2012-12-24 | year = 2012 | publisher = [[BirdLife International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='birdlife iucn'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.birdlife.org/action/science/species/global_species_programme/red_list.html | title = Birds on the IUCN Red List | accessdate = 2012-12-24 | year = 2012 | publisher = [[BirdLife International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not an endorsement of any one taxonomic system, and it may change in the future as new relationships are brought to light.

A variety of methods are used for counting Charadriiformes. For example, the [[piping plover]] is subject to the quinquennial ''Piping Plover International Census'', which is carried out in 9 Canadian provinces, 32 US states, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.

The bird was recorded 103 times between 1980 and 1990, and 74 times between 1990 and 1999.

[[Critically Endangered]] means a species has experienced a decline of at least 80% in the past ten years or three generations, or is projected to decline that much over the same period of time.&lt;ref name='Critical criteria'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/categories_criteria_3_1#critical | title = V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3062">Several [[mathematicians]] who have made contributions to the development of [[mathematics]] have hailed from [[Wales]].

* '''[[Brian Bowditch|Brian Hayward Bowditch]]''', known for his contributions to [[geometry]] and [[topology]], particularly in the areas of [[geometric group theory]] and [[low-dimensional topology]]. He is also known for solving the [[angel problem]]. Bowditch holds a chaired Professor appointment in Mathematics at the University of Warwick.
* '''[[William Jones (mathematician)|William Jones]]''', born in [[Anglesey]] in 1675, was the first recorded mathematician to use the symbol [[pi|{{pi}}]] in its present sense in 1706, though it would not achieve widespread adoption until used by famed [[Swiss people|Swiss]] mathematician [[Euler]].
* '''[[Thomas Jones (mathematician)|Thomas Jones]]''' (23 June 1756–18 July 1807) was [[Senior Wrangler]] and Senior Tutor of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|JNS774T|Jones, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[John T. Lewis]]''' (1932–2004), contributed to quantum measurement, [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein condensation]] and [[large deviations theory]].
* '''[[Richard Price]]''', wrote a paper on the proper method of calculating the values of contingent reversions which were said to have exercised a beneficial influence in drawing attention to the inadequate calculations on which many insurance and benefit societies had recently been formed. In 1769 Price received the degree of D.D. from the university of Glasgow for this work. He also wrote on finance, economics, probability, and life insurance. Price edited Bayes's major work ''An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances'' (1763), which contains the [[Bayes' Theorem]] with an introduction to the paper which provides some of the philosophical basis of [[Bayesian statistics]]. In 1765 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his work on the legacy of Bayes.
* '''[[Robert Recorde]]''', sixteenth-century inventor of the [[equals sign]] was from [[Tenby]].  As it has been suggested, "[h]is equals sign was an invention that, while slow in becoming universally adopted, is still perhaps the most fundamental thing ever invented by a person from Wales" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20040418210411/http://www.100welshheroes.com/en/biography/robertrecorde]).
* '''[[Bertrand Russell]]''', perhaps the most influential [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Intellectual|thinker]] of the twentieth century, though more properly a [[philosopher]] than a mathematician, was of English descent but born in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]].
* '''[[William Morgan (actuary)]]''', considered the father of modern [[actuarial science]].

A '''screw thread''', often shortened to '''thread''', is a [[helix|helical]] structure used to convert between rotational and linear movement or force. A screw thread is an inclined plane wrapped around a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] or [[cone (geometry)|cone]] in the form of a helix, with the former being called a ''straight'' thread and the latter called a ''tapered'' thread. More screw threads are produced each year than any other [[machine element]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=741}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Threads are generally produced according to one of the many standards of thread systems. Standards Development Organizations such as the [[ANSI|American National Standards Institute]], [[ASME|American Society of Mechanical Engineers]], [[SAE International]], [[International Organization for Standardization]], [[German Institute for Standardization|Deutsches Institut für Normung]] (German Institute for Standardization), British Association and others produce these standards for manufacturers to follow when producing threaded components.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27098">This is a list of [[void (astronomy)|voids]]. Voids are particularly galaxy-poor volumes of space between [[galaxy filament|filaments]], making up the [[large-scale structure of the universe]]. Some voids are known as ''supervoids''.

==Voids and supervoids==

In the tables, ''z'' is the cosmological [[redshift]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]], and ''h'' the dimensionless [[Hubble parameter]] (the Hubble constant ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;km&amp;nbsp;[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Mpc stands for [[megaparsec]].

|
| The claimed ''Eridanus Supervoid'' or "Great Void", reported on 24 August 2007 by the [[NRAO]] from [[Very Large Array]] Sky Survey data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrao.edu/pr/2007/coldspot/ "Astronomers Find Enormous Hole in the Universe".] [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] Press release, retrieved 24 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This void, if real, would be much larger than the others listed here (except the [[Giant Void]]), about 300 {{hub|}} Mpc in diameter and 1800–3000 {{hub|}} Mpc distant (where ''h'' is the [[Hubble parameter#Dimensionless Hubble parameter|dimensionless Hubble parameter]]). It would be associated with (and be the explanation of) a [[WMAP cold spot|cold spot]] in the [[cosmic microwave background]] at the sky location.

The evidence for such a "Great Void" is disputed by Smith and Huterer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2751 "No evidence for the cold spot in the NVSS radio survey"], Kendrick Smith and Dragan Huterer (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; They showed that the claims made of observational evidence for such a void from survey data neglected systematic effects, and did not account for ''a posteriori'' choices made in analyzing data.

[[File:Blausen 0615 Lithium Atom.png|thumb|Lithium atom]]
A '''lithium atom''' is an [[atom]] of the chemical element [[lithium]]. Lithium is composed of three electrons bound by the [[electromagnetic force]] to a nucleus containing three [[proton]]s along with either three or four [[neutron]]s, depending on the [[Isotopes of lithium|isotope]], held together by the [[strong force]]. Similarly to the case of the [[helium atom]], a closed-form solution to the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the lithium atom has not been found. However, various approximations, such as the [[Hartree–Fock method]], can be used to estimate the [[ground state]] energy and [[wavefunction]] of the atom. The [[quantum defect]] is a value that describes the deviation from [[hydrogenic]] energy levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11878">In [[queueing theory]], a discipline within the mathematical [[probability theory|theory of probability]], an '''M/G/k queue''' is a queue model where arrivals are '''M'''arkovian (modulated by a [[Poisson process]]), service times have a '''G'''eneral [[probability distribution|distribution]] and there are ''k'' servers. The model name is written in [[Kendall's notation]], and is an extension of the [[M/M/c queue]], where service times must be [[exponential distribution|exponentially distributed]] and of the [[M/G/1 queue]] with a single server. Most performance metrics for this queueing system are not known and remain an [[open problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kingman | first1 = J. F. C. | authorlink1 = John Kingman | title = The first Erlang century—and the next | journal = [[Queueing Systems]] | volume = 63 | pages = 3–4 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1007/s11134-009-9147-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model definition==

A queue represented by a M/G/''k'' queue is a stochastic process whose [[state space]] is the set {0,1,2,3...}, where the value corresponds to the number of customers in the queue, including any being served. Transitions from state ''i'' to ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 represent the arrival of a new customer: the times between such arrivals have an [[exponential distribution]] with parameter λ. Transitions from state ''i'' to ''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 represent the departure of a customer who has just finished being served: the length of time required for serving an individual customer has a general distribution function. The lengths of times between arrivals and of service periods are [[random variable]]s which are assumed to be [[statistically independent]].

==Steady state distribution==

Tijms ''et al.'' believe it is "not likely that computationally tractable methods can be developed to compute the exact numerical values of the steady-state probability in the M/G/''k'' queue."&lt;ref name="tijms"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tijms | first1 = H.

Recently a new approximate approach based on [[Laplace transform]] for steady state probabilities has been proposed by Hamzeh Khazaei ''et al.''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Khazaei | first1 = H. | last2 = Misic | first2 = J. | last3 = Misic | first3 = V.

==Average delay/waiting time==

There are numerous approximations for the average delay a job experiences.&lt;ref name="cite jstor|169760"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yao" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hokstad | first1 = Per | year = 1980 | title = The Steady-State Solution of the M/K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/m Queue | journal = Advances in Applied Probability  | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 799–823 | publisher = Applied Probability Trust | jstor = 1426432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Köllerström | first1 = Julian | year = 1974 | title = Heavy Traffic Theory for Queues with Several Servers.

M. | last2 = Longton | first2 = P. A. | doi = 10.1057/jors.1959.5 | title = Queueing Processes Associated with Airline Passenger Check-in | journal = [[Journal of the Operational Research Society]]| volume = 10 | pages = 56 | year = 1959 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result is sometimes known as Kingman's law of congestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gans | first1 = N. | last2 = Koole | first2 = G. | last3 = Mandelbaum | first3 = A. | doi = 10.1287/msom.5.2.79.16071 | title = Telephone Call Centers: Tutorial, Review, and Research Prospects | journal = [[Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management]]| volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 79 | year = 2003 | url = http://ie.technion.ac.il/Labs/Serveng/files/CCReview.pdf| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E[W^{\text{M/G/}k}] = \frac{C^2+1}{2} \mathbb E [ W^{\text{M/M/}c}]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the [[coefficient of variation]] of the service time distribution. [[Ward Whitt]] described this approximation as “usually an excellent approximation, even given extra information about the service-time distribution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whitt | first1 = W. | authorlink1 = Ward Whitt| title = Approximations for the GI/G/m Queue| doi = 10.1111/j.1937-5956.1993.tb00094.x | journal = [[Production and Operations Management]]| volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 114–161 | year = 2009 | url = http://www.columbia.edu/~ww2040/ApproxGIGm1993.pdf| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is known that no approximation using only the first two moments can be accurate in all cases.&lt;ref name="gbdz"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gupta | first1 = V. | last2 = Harchol-Balter | first2 = M. |author2-link=Mor Harchol-Balter| last3 = Dai | first3 = J. G. | last4 = Zwart | first4 = B. | title = On the inapproximability of M/G/K: Why two moments of job size distribution are not enough | doi = 10.1007/s11134-009-9133-x | journal = [[Queueing Systems]]| volume = 64 | pages = 5 | year = 2009 | url = http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1867&amp;context=compsci| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Markov–Krein]] characterisation has been shown to produce tight bounds on the mean waiting time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gupta | first1 = V. | last2 = Osogami | first2 = T. | doi = 10.1007/s11134-011-9248-8 | title = On Markov–Krein characterization of the mean waiting time in M/G/K and other queueing systems | journal = Queueing Systems | volume = 68 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 339 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-departure times==

It is conjectured that the times between departures, given a departure leaves ''n'' customers in a queue, has a mean which as ''n'' tends to infinity is different from the intuitive 1/''μ'' result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Veeger | first1 = C. | last2 = Kerner | first2 = Y. | last3 = Etman | first3 = P. | last4 = Adan | first4 = I. | title = Conditional inter-departure times from the M/G/s queue | doi = 10.1007/s11134-011-9240-3 | journal = [[Queueing Systems]]| volume = 68 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 353 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two servers==

For an M/G/2 queue (the model with two servers) the problem of determining marginal probabilities can be reduced to solving a pair of [[integral equation]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Knessl | first1 = C. | last2 = Matkowsky | first2 = B. J. | last3 = Schuss | first3 = Z. | last4 = Tier | first4 = C. | title = An Integral Equation Approach to the M/G/2 Queue | doi = 10.1287/opre.38.3.506 | journal = [[Operations Research (journal)|Operations Research]]| volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 506 | year = 1990 | jstor = 171363| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Laplace transform of the distribution when the service time distribution is a mixture of exponential distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J.

'''Microcosm''' is an interactive exhibition presenting the work of the [[CERN]] [[particle physics]] laboratory and its flagship accelerator the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC).

The exhibition displays many real objects, taking visitors on a journey through CERN’s key installations, from the [[Hydrogen]] bottle, source of the [[proton]]s that are injected into the LHC, through the first step in the accelerator chain, the [[Linear particle accelerator|Linac]], on to a model of a section of the Large Hadron Collider including elements from the [[superconducting magnet]]s. Visitors can interact with the displays to try their hand at the controls of a [[particle accelerator]] – simulating the acceleration of protons in the LHC and bringing them into collision inside the [[List of Large Hadron Collider experiments|experiments]].

The exhibition continues with a 1 :1 scale model of a complete slice through the [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] experiment at the LHC. The computing section displays some of the [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] data tapes used to store the 30-40 [[petabyte]]s of data produced yearly by the experiments, made available for analysis using the [[Worldwide LHC Computing Grid|LHC Computing GRID.]]

The annex to the exhibition contains other historical artifacts such as the central tracker from the [[UA1 experiment|UA1]] detector, which ran at the [[Super Proton Synchrotron]] at CERN from 1981 to 1984, and helped discover the [[W and Z bosons]].

Microcosm is located at [[CERN]] in the [[Canton of Geneva]], Switzerland, near the town of [[Meyrin]].  Entrance is free, without reservation, open 6 days a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Practical Information  {{!}} MICROCOSM|url = http://microcosm.web.cern.ch/en/practical-information|website = microcosm.web.cern.ch|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mountain zebra''' (''Equus zebra'') is a species in the family [[Equidae]]. It is native to south-western [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], and [[South Africa]].

==Taxonomy==
The mountain zebra comprises two [[subspecies]]:
* [[Cape mountain zebra]] (''E. z. zebra'')
* [[Hartmann's mountain zebra]] (''E. z.  hartmannae'')

In 2004, [[Colin Groves|C. P. Groves]] and C. H. Bell investigated the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the [[zebra]]s (genus ''Equus'', subgenus ''Hippotigris''). They concluded that the {{sic|Cape|hide=y|reason="Cape" is capitalized here because it is a reference to Cape Province, South Africa, not any random cape.}} mountain zebra (''Equus zebra zebra'') and Hartmann's mountain zebra (''Equus zebra hartmannea'') are distinct, and suggested that the two would be better classified as separate species, ''Equus zebra'' and ''Equus hartmannae''.&lt;ref name="GrB"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Groves | first1 = C. P. | last2 = Bell | first2 = C. H. | doi = 10.1078/1616-5047-00133 | title = New investigations on the taxonomy of the zebras genus ''Equus'', subgenus ''Hippotigris'' | journal = Mammalian Biology - Zeitschrift für Säugetierkunde | volume = 69 | issue = 3 | pages = 182 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a sexual [[Genetics|genetic]] study that included 295 mountain zebra [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s, Moodley and Harley (2005) found nothing to support the separation of the two mountain zebra populations into separate species. They concluded that the Cape mountain zebra and Hartmann's mountain zebra should remain as subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;Moodley, Y. &amp; Harley, E. H. 2005 Population structuring in mountain zebras (Equus zebra): the molecular consequences of divergent demographic histories. ''Conservation Genetics'' 6: 953–968.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is consistent with the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' (2005), which lists the mountain zebra as a single species (''Equus zebra'') with two subspecies.&lt;ref name=MSW3&gt;Wilson, Don E. &amp; Reeder, DeeAnn M. (2005) ''Mammal Species of the World''. Johns Hopkins University Press; 3rd ed. {{ISBN|978-0801882210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
[[File:Mountain zebra -uenozoo2010.ogv|thumb|left|A [[Hartmann's mountain zebra]] with a [[Barbary sheep]] behind it, in captivity at [[Ueno Zoo]], [[Japan]]]]
[[File:Hartmanns Mountain Zebra Resting.jpg|thumb|left|Hartmann's mountain zebra resting, showing its characteristic essentially unbarred belly]]
The mountain zebra has a [[dewlap]], which is more conspicuous in ''E. z.  zebra'' than in ''E. z.  hartmannae''. Like all extant zebras, mountain zebras are boldly striped in black or dark brown, and no two individuals look exactly alike. The whole body is striped except for the belly. In the Cape mountain zebra, the ground colour is effectively white, but the ground colour in Hartmann's zebra is slightly buff.&lt;ref name= "MetH"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mills, Gus  |author2=Hes, Lex  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Complete Book of Southern African Mammals | publisher = Struik Publishers | location = Cape Town | year = 1997 | isbn = 0947430555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult mountain zebras have a head-and-body length of {{convert|2.1|to|2.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a tail of {{convert|40|to|55|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. Wither height ranges from {{Convert|1.16|to|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. They weigh from {{Convert|204|to|372|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Shefferly, Nancy. [http://animaldiversity.org/site/accounts/information/Equus_zebra.html ''Equus zebra'' mountain zebra]. Animal Diversity Web&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-314-01-0001.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2018}} (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Groves and Bell found that Cape mountain zebras exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]], females being larger than males, whereas Hartmann's mountain zebras do not.&lt;ref name="GrB"/&gt; Hartmann's zebra is on average slightly larger than the Cape mountain zebra.

==Habitat==
Mountain zebras are found on mountain slopes, open grasslands, woodlands, and areas with sufficient vegetation, but their preferred habitat is mountainous terrain, especially escarpment with a diversity of grass species.&lt;ref name= "MetH"/&gt;

==Ecology==
Mountain zebras live in hot, dry, rocky, mountainous and hilly habitats. They prefer slopes and plateaus as high as {{Convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, although they do migrate lower during winter. Their preferred diet is tufted grass, but in times of shortage, they  [[Browsing (herbivory)|browse]], eating bark, twigs, leaves, buds, fruit, and roots.

They drink every day. When no surface water is available due to drought, they commonly dig for ground water in dry river beds.

The Cape mountain zebra and Hartmann's mountain zebra are now [[allopatric]], meaning that their present ranges do not overlap, which prevents them from [[crossbreed]]ing. This was not always so, and the current situation is a result of their populations being fragmented when hunters exterminated them throughout the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Historically, mountain zebras could be found across the entire length of the [[escarpment]]s along the west coast of southern Africa and in the fold mountain region in the south. However, they generally inhabited poorly productive land and were nowhere really numerous in comparison to those species of zebras or antelope that inhabited the plains, for example.&lt;ref name= "MetH"/&gt;

==Behavior and life cycle==
[[File:Mountain zebras.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A harem of [[Cape mountain zebra]]s]]
Mountain zebras do not aggregate into large herds like [[plains zebra]]s; they form small family groups consisting of a single stallion and one to five mares, together with their recent offspring. Bachelor males live in separate groups, and mature bachelors attempt to capture young mares to establish a harem. In this they are opposed by the dominant stallion of the group.
 
Mares give birth to one foal at a time. The foal feeds mainly on its mother's milk for about a year, after which it is weaned onto solid [[forage]]. Cape mountain zebra foals generally move away from their maternal herds sometime between the ages of 13 and 37 months. However, with Hartmann's mountain zebra, mares try to expel their foals when they are aged around 14 to 16 months. Young males may wander alone for a while before joining a bachelor group, while females are either taken into another breeding herd or are joined by a bachelor male to form a new breeding herd.&lt;ref name="arkive.org"&gt;[http://www.arkive.org/mountain-zebra/equus-zebra/ "Mountain zebra videos, photos and facts – ''Equus zebra''"]. ''arkive.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
The main threats to the species are the loss of habitat to agriculture, hunting, and persecution. A zebra produces a good quantity of meat, and poaching them for food (for example during guerrilla fighting) has decreased their numbers.&lt;ref name="arkive.org"/&gt;

==Conservation==
The species is listed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] under the [[IUCN Red List]]. The Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction. In the 1930s, their population was reduced to about 100 individuals. However, consistent and vigorous conservation measures have succeeded in reversing the decline, and in 1998, the population of the Cape mountain zebra was estimated to have increased to some 1200, about 540 in national parks, 490 in provincial nature reserves, and 165 in other reserves. However, the population has increased to about over 2,700 in the wild due to conservation efforts.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Though both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks, they are still threatened. The European Zoos Endangered Species Program and co-operative management of zoo populations worldwide have been set up for them.

The '''Northeast Science Station''' of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|RAS]] ({{lang-ru|Северо-Восточная научная станция РАН}}) is an [[Arctic research station]] located in [[Chersky (settlement)|Chersky]], [[Sakha Republic]] in Northeast [[Siberia]].  It is one of the world's three largest Arctic stations.&lt;ref name="arctic.ru 13 Oct. 2017" /&gt;

==Description==
The Northeast Science Station is used as a year-round base for international research in arctic biology, geophysics, and atmospheric physics. The station also houses the administration of the [[Pleistocene Park]], a local experimental wildlife preserve of 160&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Named after Russian explorer [[Jan Czerski]], Chersky is sited on frozen [[Pleistocene]] carbon. The sediments here are made up of 50% ice, and 50% [[loess]], which is a windblown sediment - the carbon content of loess deposits is five times that of a rainforest floor. During each annual melt between 2 and 5% of the stored carbon in the loess deposits is lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/public/carboeur/web_TCOS/ Terrestrial Carbon Observation System Siberia]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Far Eastern Federal University]] is planning to open an Arctic campus at the research station.  “At the station, students and young scientists will study permafrost melting; greenhouse gas emissions; hydrates conservation; biodiversity; land, atmosphere and surrounding seas pollution; and other climatic, biological and environmental issues,” according to a press release.&lt;ref name="arctic.ru 13 Oct. 2017"&gt;[http://arctic.ru/resources/20171005/682315.html “Far Eastern Federal University may open Arctic campus at major polar station.”] Arctic.Ru, 5 October 2017. Retrieved 13 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1830">'''Online engineering''' (OE; Sometimes also referred to as ''remote engineering'') is a current trend in engineering and science, aiming to allow and organize a shared use of equipment and resources, but also specialized software (such as for example [[simulators]]).

Reasons for the growing importance of sharing engineering resources are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =IAOE Focus|publisher=IAOE|url=https://online-engineering.org/focus.htm|accessdate = 2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the growing complexity of engineering tasks,
* more and more specialized and expensive equipment as well as software tools and simulators,
* the necessary use of expensive equipment and software tools/simulators in short-time projects,
* the application of high-tech equipment also in [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]],
* the need of high qualified staff to control recent equipment,
* the demands of globalization and division of labor,

The [[IAOE|International Association of Online Engineering (IAOE)]] is an international non-profit organization with the objective of encouraging the wider development, distribution and application of online engineering. The main forum of online engineering community is the annual ''[[REV (Conference)|International Conference on Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation (REV)]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5970">In [[science]], a '''parameter space''' is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible combinations of values for all the different [[parameter]]s contained in a particular [[mathematical model]]. The ranges of values of the parameters may form the axes of a [[Plot (graphics)|plot]], and particular outcomes of the model may be plotted against these axes to illustrate how different regions of the parameter space produce different types of behaviour in the model.

Often the parameters are inputs of a [[function (mathematics)|function]], in which case the technical term for the parameter space is [[domain of a function]].

Parameter spaces are particularly useful for describing families of [[probability distribution]]s that depend on parameters. More generally in science, the term parameter space is used to describe experimental variables. For example, the concept has been used in the science of [[soccer]] in the article "Parameter space for successful soccer kicks." In the study, "Success rates are determined through the use of four-dimensional parameter space volumes."&lt;ref&gt;Brandon G. Cook &amp; John Eric Goff (2006) [http://stacks.iop.org/EJP/27/865 Parameter Space for Successful Soccer Kicks] [[European Journal of Physics]] 27:865.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[statistics]], parameter spaces form the background for [[parameter estimation]].
As Ross describes in his book:&lt;ref&gt;Gavin J.S. Ross (1990) ''Nonlinear Estimation'', page 94, [[Springer-Verlag]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Parameter space is a subset of p-dimensional space consisting of the set of values of &amp;Theta; which are allowable in a particular model. The values may sometimes be constrained, say to the positive quadrant or the unit square, or in case of symmetry, to the triangular region where, say &lt;math&gt;\Theta_1 \le \Theta_2.&lt;/math&gt;

The idea of intentionally truncating the parameter space has also been advanced elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constance van Eeden|Van Eeden, C.]] (2006)[https://books.google.com/books?id=m-MePzncfyAC&amp;pg=PA3 ''Restricted parameter space estimation problems: admissibility and minimaxity properties''], Springer {{ISBN|0-387-33747-4}} (p. 2)  "Gains in the minimax value can be very substantial when the parameter space is bounded."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* A simple model of health deterioration after developing [[lung cancer]] could include the two parameters gender&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gasperino |first=J. |author2=Rom, W. N. |year=2004 |title=Gender and lung cancer |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525730411701863 |journal=Clinical Lung Cancer |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=353–359 |doi= 10.3816/CLC.2004.n.013|pmid= |bibcode=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and smoker/non-smoker, in which case the parameter space is the following set of four possibilities: {{math|{(Male, Smoker), (Male, Non-smoker), (Female, Smoker), (Female, Non-smoker)} }}.
* The [[logistic map]] &lt;math&gt; x_{n+1} = r x_n (1-x_n) &lt;/math&gt; has one parameter, ''r'', which can take any positive value. The parameter space is therefore [[positive real numbers]]. 
:For some values of ''r'', this function ends up cycling round a few values, or fixed on one value. These long-term values can be plotted against ''r'' in a [[bifurcation diagram]] to show the different behaviours of the function for different values of ''r''.

* In a [[sine wave]] model &lt;math&gt;y(t) = A \cdot \sin(\omega t + \phi),&lt;/math&gt; the parameters are [[amplitude]] ''A'' &gt; 0, [[angular frequency]] ω &gt; 0, and [[phase (waves)|phase]] φ ∈ S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus the parameter space is &lt;math&gt;R^+ \times R^+ \times S^1 .&lt;/math&gt;

* In [[complex dynamics]], the parameter space is the [[complex plane]] '''C''' = { ''z'' = ''x'' + ''y'' i : x, y ∈ '''R''' }, where i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;1.

:The famous [[Mandelbrot set]] is a [[subset]] of this parameter space, consisting of the points in the complex plane which give a  [[bounded set]] of numbers when a particular [[iterated function]] is repeatedly applied from that starting point. The remaining points, which are not in the set, give an unbounded set of numbers (they tend to infinity) when this function is repeatedly applied from that starting point.

==History==
Parameter space contributed to the liberation of [[geometry]] from the confines of [[three-dimensional space]]. For instance, the parameter space of [[sphere (geometry)|spheres]] in three dimensions, has four dimensions—three for the sphere center and another for the radius.  According to [[Dirk Struik]], it was the book ''Neue Geometrie des Raumes'' (1849) by [[Julius Plücker]] that showed
:...geometry need not solely be based on points as basic elements. Lines, planes, circles, spheres can all be used as the elements (''Raumelemente'') on which a geometry can be based. This fertile conception threw new light on both synthetic and algebraic geometry and created new forms of duality. The number of dimensions of a particular form of geometry could now be any positive number, depending on the number of parameters necessary to define the "element".&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[Dirk Struik]] (1967) ''A Concise History of Mathematics'', 3rd edition, [[Dover Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}}
The requirement for higher dimensions is illustrated by [[Plücker coordinates|Plücker's line geometry]]. Struik writes
:[Plücker's] geometry of lines in three-space could be considered as a four-dimensional geometry, or, as [[Felix Klein|Klein]] has stressed, as the geometry of a four-dimensional [[quadric]] in a five-dimensional space.&lt;ref name=DS/&gt;{{rp|168}}
Thus the [[Klein quadric]] describes the parameters of lines in space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3622">'''Planck temperature''', denoted by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;, is the unit of [[temperature]] in the system of [[natural units]] known as [[Planck units]].

It serves as the defining unit of the [[Planck temperature scale]].  In this scale the magnitude of the Planck temperature is equal to 1, while that of [[absolute zero]] is 0.
Other temperatures can be converted to Planck temperature units. For example, {{val|0|u=°C}} = {{val|273.15|u=K}} = {{val|1.9279|e=-30|u=''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

In SI units, the Planck temperature is about {{val|1.417|e=32}} kelvin (equivalently, degrees Celsius, since the difference is trivially small at this scale), or {{val|2.55|e=32}} degrees Fahrenheit or Rankine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.translatorscafe.com/cafe/EN/units-converter/temperature/6-1/Planck_temperature-kelvin/ TranslatorsCafe.com] - Unit Converter&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
What today is known as the Planck temperature was first introduced in 1899 by [[Max Planck]] together with his introduction of what today is known as the Planck length, the Planck mass and Planck time.&lt;ref&gt;Tomilin, K. A., 1999, "[http://www.ihst.ru/personal/tomilin/papers/tomil.pdf Natural Systems of Units: To the Centenary Anniversary of the Planck System]", 287–296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Planck. "Natürliche Einheiten." ''Königlich-Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften'', pp. 479-480, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The Planck temperature is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;T_\text{P} = \frac{m_\text{P} c^2}{k} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G k^2}}\approx&lt;/math&gt;  
{{val|1.416808|(33)|e=32|u=[[kelvin|K]]}}
where:
*''m''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Planck mass]],
*''c'' is [[speed of light]] in a vacuum,
*&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]] defined as &lt;math&gt;\hbar\ = \frac{h}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;,
*''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]],
*''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].

The two digits between the [[Bracket|parentheses]] are used to denote the [[Standard error (statistics)|standard error]] of the last two digits of the estimated value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?plktmp |title= CODATA Value: Planck temperature |publisher= NIST | work = The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty |accessdate=2011-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
As with most of the Planck units, a Planck temperature of 1 (unity) is a fundamental limit of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], in combination with [[gravitation]], as presently understood. In other words, the wavelength of light emitted by an object can be calculated by its temperature. If an object were to reach the temperature of {{val|1.42|e=32|u=kelvin}} (''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;), the radiation it would emit would have a wavelength of {{val|1.616|e=−35|u=meters}} ([[Planck length]]), at which point quantum gravitational effects become relevant. At temperatures greater than or equal to ''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;, current physical theory breaks down because we lack a theory of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;Nova: ''[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/zero/hot.html Absolute Hot]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regional science''' is a field of the [[social science]]s concerned with analytical approaches to problems that are specifically [[Urban area|urban]], [[rural]], or [[region]]al. Topics in regional science include, but are not limited to [[location theory]] or spatial economics, location modeling, transportation, migration analysis, [[land use]] and [[urban development]], [[input-output analysis|interindustry analysis]], environmental and [[ecology|ecological]] analysis, [[resource management]], urban and regional [[policy]] analysis, [[geographical information systems]], and [[spatial data analysis]]. In the broadest sense, any social science analysis that has a spatial dimension is embraced by regional scientists.

==Origins==
Regional science was founded in the late 1940s when some [[economist]]s began to become dissatisfied with the low level of regional [[economics|economic]] analysis and felt an urge to upgrade it. But even in this early era, the founders of regional science expected to catch the interest of people from a wide variety of disciplines. Regional science's formal roots date to the aggressive campaigns by [[Walter Isard]] and his supporters to promote the "objective" and "scientific" analysis of settlement, industrial location, and urban development. Isard targeted key universities and campaigned tirelessly. Accordingly, the [[Regional Science Association]] was founded in 1954, when the core group of scholars and practitioners held its first meetings independent from those initially held as sessions of the annual meetings of the American Economics Association.&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. 1975. ''Introduction to Regional Science.'' New York: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  A reason for meeting independently undoubtedly was the group's desire to extend the new science beyond the rather restrictive world of economists and have natural scientists, psychologists, anthropologists, lawyers, sociologists, political scientists, planners, and geographers join the club.&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. 1975. ''Introduction to Regional Science.'' New York: Prentice Hall, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Now called the [[Regional Science Association International]] (RSAI), it maintains subnational and international associations, journals, and a conference circuit (notably in North America, continental Europe, [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]]). Membership in the RSAI continues to grow.

==Seminal publications==

Topically speaking, regional science took off in the wake of [[Walter Christaller]]'s book ''Die Zentralen Orte in Sűddeutschland'' (Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1933; transl. ''Central Places in Southern Germany'', 1966), soon followed by [[Tord Palander]]'s (1935) ''Beiträge zur Standortstheorie''; [[August Lösch]]'s ''Die räumliche Ordnung der Wirtschaft'' (Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1940; 2nd rev. edit., 1944; transl. ''The Economics of Location'', 1954) ; and [[Edgar M. Hoover]]'s two books--''Location Theory and the Shoe and Leather Industry'' (1938) and ''The Location of Economic Activity'' (1948). Other important early publications include: [[Edward Chamberlin|Edward H. Chamberlin]]'s (1950) ''The Theory of Monopolistic Competition'' ; [[François Perroux]]'s (1950) ''Economic Spaces: Theory and Application''; [[Torsten Hägerstrand]]'s (1953) ''Innovationsförloppet ur Korologisk Synpunkt''; [[Edgar S. Dunn]]'s (1954)''The Location of Agricultural Production'' ; [[Martin J. Beckmann]], C.B McGuire, and Clifford B. Winston's (1956) ''Studies in the Economics of Transportation''; [[Melvin L. Greenhut]]'s (1956) ''Plant Location in Theory and Practice''; [[Gunnar Myrdal]]'s (1957) ''Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions''; [[Albert O. Hirschman]]'s (1958) ''The Strategy of Economic Development''; and [[Claude Ponsard]]'s (1958) ''Histoire des Théories Économiques Spatiales''. Nonetheless, Walter Isard's first book in 1956, ''Location and Space Economy'', apparently captured the imagination of many, and his third, ''Methods of Regional Analysis'', published in 1960, only sealed his position as the father of the field.

As is typically the case, the above works were built on the shoulders of giants. Much of this predecessor work is documented well in Walter Isard's ''Location and Space Economy''&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. 1956. ''Location and Space-Economy: A General Theory Relating to Industrial Location, Market Areas, Land Use, Trade and Urban Structure'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Claude Ponsard's ''Histoire des Théorie Économique Spatiales''.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsard, Claude. 1958. ''Histoire des Théories Économiques Spatiales''. Paris: Librairie Armand Colin (Translated in 1983 by Benjamin H. Stevens, Margaret Chevallier and Joaquin P. Pujol as ''History of Spatial Economic Theory''. Springer-Verlag: New York.)&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly important was the contribution by 19th century German economists to [[location theory]]. The early German hegemony more or less starts with [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]] and runs through both [[Wilhelm Launhardt]] and [[Alfred Weber]] to [[Walter Christaller]] and [[August Lösch]].

==Core journals==

If an academic discipline is identified by its journals, then technically regional science began in 1955 with the publication of the first volume of the ''Papers and Proceedings, Regional Science Association'' (now ''[[Papers in Regional Science]]'' published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]). In 1958, the  ''[[Journal of Regional Science]]'' followed. Since the 1970s, the number of journals serving the field has exploded. The [http://www.regionalscience.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;layout=category&amp;task=category&amp;id=95&amp;Itemid=619 RSAI website] displays most of them.

Most recently the journal ''[[Spatial Economic Analysis]]'' has been published by the RSAI British and Irish Section with the ''[[Regional Studies Association]]''. The latter is a separate and growing organisation involving economists, planners, geographers, political scientists, management academics, policymakers, and practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regional-studies-assoc.ac.uk/ Regional Studies Association – Home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219053606/http://www.regional-studies-assoc.ac.uk/ |date=2008-12-19 }}. Regional-studies-assoc.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2011-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic programs==

[[Walter Isard]]'s efforts culminated in the creation of a few academic departments and several university-wide programs in regional science. At Walter Isard's suggestion, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] started the Regional Science Department in 1956. It featured as its first graduate [[William Alonso]] and was looked upon by many to be the international academic leader for the field. Another important graduate and faculty member of the department is [[Masahisa Fujita]]. The core curriculum of this department was [[microeconomics]], [[input-output analysis]], [[location theory]], and [[statistics]]. Faculty also taught courses in [[mathematical programming]], [[transportation economics]], [[labor economics]], energy and ecological policy modeling, [[spatial statistics]], spatial interaction theory and models, [[benefit/cost analysis]], urban and regional analysis, and economic development theory, among others. But the department's unusual multidisciplinary orientation undoubtedly encouraged its demise, and it lost its department status in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, David. 2004. "A Short History of the field of Regional Science," ''Papers in Regional Science,'' 83, 31–57. The source for a few dates in this paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a few exceptions, such as [[Cornell University]], which awards graduate degrees in Regional Science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://aap.cornell.edu/crp/programs/regsci/ Cornell College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, Department of City and Regional Planning: About Regional Science]&lt;/ref&gt; most practitioners hold positions in departments such as economics, geography, [[civil engineering]], [[agricultural economics]], [[rural sociology]], urban planning, public policy, or [[demography]]. The diversity of disciplines participating in regional science have helped make it one of the most interesting and fruitful fields of academic specialization, but it has also made it difficult to fit the many perspectives into a curriculum for an academic major. It is even difficult for authors to write regional science textbooks, since what is elementary knowledge for one discipline might be entirely novel for another.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Loveridge discusses the pros and cons of a multidisciplinary field. [http://www.rri.wvu.edu/loveridgeintroregsci.htm link]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624065420/http://www.rri.wvu.edu/loveridgeintroregsci.htm |date=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public policy impact==
Part of the movement was, and continues to be, associated with the political and economic realities of the role of the local community. On any occasion where public policy is directed at the sub-national level, such as a city or group of counties, the methods of regional science can prove useful. Traditionally, regional science has provided policymakers with guidance on the following issues:&lt;ref&gt;Classical regional science questions. [http://www.rri.wvu.edu/loveridgeintroregsci.htm link]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624065420/http://www.rri.wvu.edu/loveridgeintroregsci.htm |date=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Determinants of industrial location (both within the nation and region)
:*Regional economic impact of the arrival or departure of a firm
:*Determinants of internal migration patterns and land-use change
:*Regional specialization and exchange
:*Environmental impacts of social and economic change
:*Geographic association of economic and social conditions

By targeting federal resources to specific geographic areas the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration realized that political favors could be bought. This is also evident in Europe and other places where local economic areas do not coincide with political boundaries. In the more current era of devolution knowledge about "local solutions to local problems" has driven much of the interest in regional science. Thus, there has been much political impetus to the growth of the discipline.

==Developments after 1980==
Regional science has enjoyed mixed fortunes since the 1980s. While it has gained a larger following among economists and public policy practitioners, the discipline has fallen out of favor among more radical and [[post-modernist]] geographers. In an apparent effort to secure a larger share of research funds, geographers had the [[National Science Foundation]]'s Geography and Regional Science Program renamed "Geography and Spatial Sciences".

===New economic geography===
In 1991, [[Paul Krugman]], as a highly regarded international trade theorist, put out a call for economists to pay more attention to economic geography in a book entitled ''Geography and Trade'', focusing largely on the core regional science concept of  agglomeration economies. Krugman's call renewed interest by economists in regional science and, perhaps more importantly, founded what some term the "new economic geography", which enjoys much common ground with regional science. Broadly trained "new economic geographers" combine quantitative work with other research techniques, for example at the [[London School of Economics]]. The unification of Europe and the increased internationalization of the world's economic, social, and political realms has further induced interest in the study of regional, as opposed to national, phenomena.  The new economic geography appears to have garnered more interest in Europe than in America where amenities, notably climate, have been found to better predict human location and re-location patterns, as emphasized in recent work by Mark Partridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1435-5957.2010.00315.x | volume=89 | title=The duelling models: NEG vs amenity migration in explaining US engines of growth | journal=Papers in Regional Science | pages=513–536 | last1 = Partridge | first1 = Mark D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Krugman won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] and his Prize Lecture has references both to work in regional science's location theory as well as economic's trade theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2008/krugman-lecture.html Paul Krugman's Nobel Prize Lecture 2008].

===Criticisms===
Today there are dwindling numbers of regional scientists from academic [[planning]] programs and mainstream [[geography]] departments. Attacks on regional science's practitioners by radical critics began as early as the 1970s, notably [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] who believed it lacked social and political commitment. Regional science's founder, Walter Isard, never envisioned regional scientists would be political or planning activists. In fact, he suggested that they will seek to be sitting in front of a computer and surrounded by research assistants. [[Trevor J. Barnes]] suggests the decline of regional science practice among planners and geographers in North America could have been avoided. He says "It is unreflective, and consequently inured to change, because of a commitment to a God’s eye view. It is so convinced of its own rightness, of its Archimedean position, that it remained aloof and invariant, rather than being sensitive to its changing local context." &lt;ref&gt;Barnes in ''Canadian J of Reg. Sci''.

'''''Scientific Memoirs''', Selected from the Transactions of Foreign Academies of science and Learned Societies and from Foreign Journals'' was a series of books edited and published by [[Richard Taylor (editor)|Richard Taylor]] (1781–1858) in [[London]] between 1837 and 1852.

After 1852 the publication continued in two series:
#[[Natural philosophy]], edited by [[J. Tyndall]] and William Francis
#[[Natural history]], edited by [[Arthur Henfrey (botanist)|Arthur Henfrey]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]

The September 1843 edition contained [[Ada Lovelace]]'s notes appended to her translation of [[Luigi Federico Menabrea]]'s article, originally published in 1842 in French in the Swiss Journal [[Bibliothèque universelle de Genève]], based on Charles Babbage's lectures on his [[Analytical Engine]], given in Turin, Italy, in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Christopher|url=http://www.yorku.ca/christo/papers/Babbage-CogSci.htm|title=Charles Babbage, the Analytical Engine, and the Possibility of a 19th-Century Cognitive Science|publisher=York University| date=2001|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some volumes have been reprinted by Johnson Reprint Corp. [[New York City|New York]] in 1966.

The Solomon Four Group Design is a [[research method]] that is sometimes used in [[social science]], [[psychology]] and medicine. It can be used if there are concerns that the treatment might be sensitized by the pre-test.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Research in Education by Donald Ary, Lucy Jacobs, Christine Sorensen&lt;/ref&gt; The four groups have four different experiences:
# Pre-test, treatment, post-test
# Pre-test, no treatment, post-test
# Treatment, post-test
# No treatment, post-test

The effectiveness of the treatment can be evaluated by comparisons between groups 1 and 2 and between groups 3 and 4.

'''Soyuz-B''' ({{lang-ru|Союз-Б}} meaning Union-B) or '''Soyuz 9K''' ({{lang-ru|Союз 9К}}) was a proposed [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spacecraft, which was designed for use as an [[orbital tug]]. A number of applications were proposed for it, including use as part of the [[Soyuz A-B-V]] complex for manned [[circumlunar]] [[spaceflight]].

The Soyuz 9K was intended to have been launched into [[low Earth orbit]] by the [[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]] 11A511 [[launch vehicle|carrier rocket]]. Following launch, it would have been refuelled by up to three [[Soyuz-V]] tankers, before commencing its mission. It was primarily intended for use in boosting manned [[Soyuz 7K]] and [[Soyuz-P]] spacecraft into higher orbits; the Soyuz-A onto a circumlunar trajectory for manned Lunar exploration, and the Soyuz-P into a higher orbit to [[anti-satellite weapon|intercept and destroy]] another spacecraft.

The Soyuz 9K consisted of two modules: the main spacecraft, and a docking module, NO ({{lang-ru|НО}}). The NO module housed rendezvous and docking systems for the Soyuz-V, as well as equipment for transferring fuel, and additional manoeuvring thrusters. Once the payload spacecraft had docked, the NO would be jettisoned, and the main engine would ignite to propel the Soyuz 9K and its docked payload into a higher orbit.

Following the cancellation of both the Soyuz 7K and P programmes; the former in favour of the [[LK-1]] spacecraft, and the latter in favour of unmanned anti-satellite programmes, the Soyuz 9K was no longer required, and it too was cancelled.

[[Land use]] change is fundamental to the operations of the [[biosphere]] because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to [[urbanisation]], [[agriculture]], [[forest]], [[woodland]], [[grassland]] and [[pasture]] have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen [[biogeochemical cycle]]s.&lt;ref name="Krebs 2001 pp. 560–582"&gt;Krebs (2001) pp. 560–582.&lt;/ref&gt; Management of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] involves assessment of all aspects of the [[carbon cycle]] to identify opportunities to address human-induced [[climate change]] and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on [[biodiversity]] and human communities.

Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the [[air pollution]] in cities, the [[pollutants]] including toxic chemicals like [[nitrogen oxides]], [[Sulfur oxide|sulphur oxides]], [[volatile organic compounds]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]] that produce [[photochemical smog]] and [[acid rain]], and the [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s that degrade the [[ozone layer]].

Known as [[global dimming]] the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global [[water cycle]] by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a [[Thermal energy|cooling]] effect and this may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gases]] on [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;Hegerl, G.C. et al. (2007).

==Freshwater==
{{See|Water crisis}}

Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is the salty water of the [[ocean]]s and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. The remaining freshwater is found in lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. All life depends on the solar-powered global water cycle, the evaporation from oceans and land to form water vapour that later condenses from clouds as rain, which then becomes the renewable part of the freshwater supply.&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;Clarke &amp; King (2006) pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Awareness of the global importance of preserving [[water]] for [[ecosystem services]] has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world’s [[wetlands]] have been lost along with their valuable environmental services.

==Land==
{{See|Land use}}
Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as [[natural capital]] is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the [[biosphere]] because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to [[urbanisation]], [[agriculture]], [[forest]], [[woodland]], [[grassland]] and [[pasture]] have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems.&lt;ref name="Krebs 2001 pp. 560–582"/&gt; At the local human scale major sustainability benefits accrue from the pursuit of [[green cities]] and [[sustainable gardening|sustainable parks and gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G6220 Organic Gardening Techniques], ''Missouri University Extension''.

Since the [[Neolithic Revolution]], human use has reduced the world’s forest cover by about 47%. Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the world’s ice-free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics&lt;ref&gt;World Resources Institute (1998). ''World Resources 1998–1999.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-521408-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In temperate and [[boreal forest|boreal]] regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but [[deforestation]] in the tropics is of major concern.&lt;ref&gt;Groombridge &amp; Jenkins (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Forests moderate the local climate and the global water cycle through their light reflectance ([[albedo]]) and [[evapotranspiration]]. They also conserve [[biodiversity]], protect [[water quality]], preserve soil and [[soil quality]], provide fuel and [[pharmaceuticals]], and purify the air. These free [[ecosystem services]] are not given a market value under most current economic systems, and so forest conservation has little appeal when compared with the economic benefits of [[logging]] and clearance which, through [[soil degradation]] and organic [[decomposition]] returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name = FAO1&gt;Food and Agriculture Organisation (2006). [http://www.fao.org/forestry/fra2005/en "Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005: Progress Towards Sustainable Forest Management."] ''Forestry paper'' 147. Rome: FAO. Retrieved on: 2009-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) estimates that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil are a major source of emissions).&lt;ref name = FAO1/&gt; [[Climate change]] can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in [[reafforestation]] schemes, plantations and timber products. Also wood biomass can be utilized as a renewable [[carbon-neutral]] fuel. The FAO has suggested that, over the period 2005–2050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10–20% of man-made emissions – so monitoring the condition of the world's forests must be part of a global strategy to mitigate emissions and protect ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC (2006).'' IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Inventories, Vol.4, Agriculture, Forestry, and other Land Uses.'' Japan: Institute for Global Environment Strategies.&lt;/ref&gt; However, climate change may pre-empt this FAO scenario as a study by the [[International Union of Forest Research Organizations]] in 2009 concluded that the stress of a 2.5C (4.5F) temperature rise above pre-industrial levels could result in the release of vast amounts of carbon&lt;ref&gt;Kinver, M.

''Nature'' '''429''': 870–873.&lt;/ref&gt; Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness – everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s to the resource costs of food packaging, [[transport]] (now a major part of global trade) and retail. [[Food]] is essential to life. But the list of environmental costs of [[food production]] is a long one: topsoil depletion, [[erosion]] and conversion to desert from constant tillage of annual crops; overgrazing; [[Soil salinity|salinization]]; [[sodification]]; [[waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]]; high levels of [[fossil fuel]] use; reliance on inorganic fertilisers and synthetic organic [[pesticides]]; reductions in [[genetic diversity]] by the mass use of [[monoculture]]s; water resource depletion; [[pollution]] of waterbodies by run-off and [[groundwater contamination]]; social problems including the decline of family farms and weakening of [[rural communities]].&lt;ref&gt;Tudge (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these environmental problems associated with [[industrial agriculture]] and [[agribusiness]] are now being addressed through such movements as [[sustainable agriculture]], [[organic farming]] and more sustainable business practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org/templates/TemplateWBCSD5/layout.asp?MenuID=1 World Business Council for Sustainable Development] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410074308/http://www.wbcsd.org/templates/TemplateWBCSD5/layout.asp?MenuID=1 |date=2009-04-10 }} This web site has multiple articles on [[WBCSD]] contributions to sustainable development.

[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|alt=Picture of the now extinct bird the dodo|The extinct [[dodo]] (''Raphus cucullatus'')]]

Although [[biodiversity loss]] can be monitored simply as loss of species, effective conservation demands the protection of species within their natural habitats and ecosystems. Following human migration and population growth, species [[extinctions]] have progressively increased to a rate unprecedented since the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. Known as the [[Holocene extinction event]] this current human-induced extinction of species ranks as one of the worlds six mass [[extinction event]]s. Some scientific estimates indicate that up to half of presently existing species may become extinct by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leakey &amp; Lewin (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Current extinction rates are 100 to 1000 times their prehuman levels with more than 10% birds and mammals threatened, about 8% of plants, 5% of fish and more than 20% of freshwater species.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 42–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 [[IUCN Red List]] warns that long-term droughts and extreme weather put additional stress on key habitats and, for example, lists 1,226 bird species as threatened with extinction, which is one-in-eight of all bird species.&lt;ref&gt;Kinver, M. (May 2008). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7409034.stm ''Climate 'accelerating bird loss.''] BBC News, UK.

[[File:Kudzu on trees in Atlanta, Georgia.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Trees infested with Kudzu (''Pueraria lobata'')|[[Kudzu]] (''Pueraria lobata'') infesting trees in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, USA]]
In many parts of the industrial world land clearing for agriculture has diminished and here the greatest threat to biodiversity, after [[climate change]], has become the destructive effect of [[invasive species]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly efficient global transport has facilitated the spread of [[organism]]s across the planet. The potential danger of this aspect of [[globalization]] is starkly illustrated through the spread of human diseases like [[HIV]] [[AIDS]], [[mad cow disease]], [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and [[swine flu]], but invasive plants and animals are also having a devastating impact on native [[biodiversity]]. Non-indigenous organisms can quickly occupy disturbed land and natural areas where, in the absence of their natural [[predator]]s, they are able to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs (2001) pp. 190–205.&lt;/ref&gt; At the global scale this issue is being addressed through the [[Global Invasive Species Information Network]] but there is improved international [[biosecurity]] legislation to minimise the transmission of pathogens and invasive organisms. Also, through [[CITES]] legislation there is control the trade in rare and threatened species. Increasingly at the local level public awareness programs are alerting communities, gardeners, the nursery industry, collectors, and the pet and aquarium industries, to the harmful effects of potentially invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;Blood (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance to change==
{{Main|Sustainability and systemic change resistance}}
The environmental sustainability problem has proven difficult to solve. The modern [[environmental movement]] has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe [[ecological footprint]] overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the [[climate change]] problem. Something within the human system in preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior. That system trait is systemic change resistance. Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance, barriers to change, or policy resistance.&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, "Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, pp 5-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Søren Pedersen Abildgaard''' (18 February 1718 – 2 July 1791) was a  [[Denmark|Danish]] [[natural history|naturalist]], writer and [[illustrator]]. He was born in [[Flekkefjord]] in [[Norway]] and died in [[Copenhagen]] in [[Denmark]].

Abildgaard traveled throughout [[Denmark]] in order to create drawings of its tombstones, runes and other historic monuments. In 1753–54 he was an illustrator and painter on historian [[Jacob Langebek]]'s tour to [[Sweden]] and the [[Baltic governorates|Baltic provinces]].&lt;ref name=RU&gt;[http://runeberg.org/dbl/1/0075.html Danish biographical encyclopaedia / I. Vol. Aaberg - Beaumelle] at Runeberg.org&lt;/ref&gt; He is also remembered for his studies of [[topography|topographical]] and [[geological]] conditions and phenomena.&lt;ref name=NO&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=no&amp;u=https://snl.no/S%25C3%25B8ren_Abildgaard&amp;prev=search Søren Abildgaard] at Store norske leksikon&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1755 to 1778 he worked as a master draftsman at the Royal ''[[Gehejmearkivet]]'' in Copenhagen. His drawings are presently kept at the [[National Museum of Denmark]] and at the [[Frederiksborg Castle|Frederiksborg Museum]] in [[Hillerød]] and are regarded as important sources for antiquarian research.&lt;ref name=NO/&gt; 

He was married to Anne Margrethe Bastholm,&lt;ref name=RU/&gt; and had two sons, [[Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard]] (1744–1809) and [[Peter Christian Abildgaard]] (1740–1801).

== Published works ==
In 1759 he published the first geological account of the [[chert]] and fossil bearing [[chalk]] beds at [[Stevns Klint]] on the Danish island of [[Zealand]], ''Beskrivelse over Stevens Klint og dens naturlige Mærkværdigheder''. His other works include ''Physisk-mineralogisk Beskrivelse over Möens klint'' (Physical and [[mineralogical]] description of [[Møns Klint]]; 1781) and a treatise on [[peat]], titled ''Afhandling om Tørv'' (1765).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minrec.org/libdetail.asp?id=3 Abildgaard, Søren] The Mineralogical Record - Library&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution''''' is an overview of the history of [[computer science]] and the [[Digital Revolution]]. It was written by [[Walter Isaacson]], and published in 2014 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].

The book summarizes the contributions of several innovators who have made pivotal breakthroughs in computer technology and its applications—from the world's first [[computer programmer]], [[Ada Lovelace]], and [[Alan Turing]]'s work in [[artificial intelligence]], through the [[Information Age]] of the present.&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://charlierose.com/videos/16080 | title=Interview with Walter Isaacson (with transcript) | publisher=[[PBS]] | work=[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]] | date=October 13, 2014 | accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Innovators/Walter-Isaacson/9781476708690|title=The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution |website=books.simonandschuster.com|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York, NY |accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his book's focus is on individuals, Isaacson reminds readers that innovations are often the product of group collaboration.

Innovators discussed in the book include [[Charles Babbage]], [[Ada Lovelace]], [[Vannevar Bush]], [[Alan Turing]], [[Grace Hopper]], [[John Mauchly]], [[John von Neumann]], [[J. C. R. Licklider]], [[Doug Engelbart]], [[Robert Noyce]] of [[Intel]], [[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] of [[Microsoft]], [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Steve Jobs]] of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Tim Berners-Lee]], [[Larry Page]] of [[Google]], [[Jimmy Wales]] of [[Wikipedia]], and [[Lee Felsenstein]] of [[Osborne Computer Corporation|Osborne]].

==Corrections==
In December 2015, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] published a revised electronic edition of ''The Innovators'', which corrected significant errors and omissions in the original edition’s Chapter 9, which covers Software. Isaacson – who in researching the book interviewed Bill Gates but not Paul Allen – had erroneously assigned virtually all credit for the company’s early innovations and success to Gates, when in fact they were the product of highly collaborative efforts by several people, including Allen. In the revised edition, among other edits, Isaacson includes archival material from 1981 in which Gates credits Allen for being the “idea man” in charge of R&amp;D at Microsoft, while he, Gates, was “the front man running the business.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isaacson|first1=Walter|title=The Innovators: How a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution|date=December 2015|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=1471138798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UDFy-38135539''' (also known as "HUDF.YD3") is the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]] (UDF) identifier for a [[galaxy]] which was calculated {{As of|2010|October|lc=on}} to have a light travel time of 13.1 [[Giga-|billion]] years&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt; with a present [[Comoving distance#Uses of the proper distance|proper distance]] of around 30 billion [[light-year]]s.

It was discovered by three teams in September 2009 in sensitive infrared [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images and identified by these as source UDF-38135539 ([[Rychard Bouwens|R Bouwens]] ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="Bouwens"&gt;{{cite journal|author=R.J.

All teams independently identified the source likely an extremely distant galaxy because there was no measurable light at [[visible spectrum|visible wavelengths]] (caused by absorption of [[hydrogen gas]] along the line of sight). Following the discovery of this candidate distant galaxy, another team targeted this object with ground-based [[spectroscopy]] to confirm the distance, reporting a [[redshift]] z=8.6.&lt;ref name=Lehnert2010&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lehnert |first1=M.

However, attempts to replicate this observation strongly suggest the original claim was in error, meaning that at the present time the galaxy only has a photometric redshift estimate.&lt;ref&gt;VLT/XSHOOTER &amp; Subaru/MOIRCS Spectroscopy of HUDF-YD3: No Evidence for Lyman-alpha Emission at z=8.55&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detection ==
Its first known imaging was in [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble telescope]]'s [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]], the most detailed deep space picture at that time.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt; The galaxy was observed in August and September 2009.&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19603-dim-galaxy-is-most-distant-object-yet-found.html |title=Dim galaxy is most distant object yet found |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SciAm"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matson |first=John |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=farthest-galaxy |title=Early Bloomer: Faraway Galaxy Pushes Cosmic View Closer to the Dawn of the Universe |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.16176.x |publisher=Scientific American|date=2010|arxiv = 0909.2437 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.403..960M |volume=403 |issue=2 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |pages=960–983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image data was released to the scientific community, which led to the galaxy's detection by the teams of Bouwens,&lt;ref name="Bouwens"/&gt; Bunker&lt;ref name="Bunker"/&gt; and McLure,&lt;ref name="McLure"/&gt; and subsequent spectroscopic campaign by the team of Lehnert and colleagues.&lt;ref name="DMUK"&gt;{{cite news|author=David Derbyshire |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1322166/UDFy-38135539-galaxy-13-billion-light-years-away-astronomers.html |title=Astronomers find most remote galaxy ever seen... 13 BILLION light years away |publisher=DailyMail.co.uk |date= 20 October 2010|accessdate=2010-10-21 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just on Hubble data, the galaxy could be an object intrinsically red and relatively close to [[Earth]],&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt; therefore, confirmation using suitably sensitive [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] equipment was needed.&lt;ref name="DMUK"/&gt; This was attempted using the [[European Southern Observatory]]'s SINFONI-equipped [[Very Large Telescope]] unit Yepun, located atop [[Cerro Paranal]] in [[Chile]]'s [[Atacama Desert]].&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Boyle|url=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/10/20/5322427-scientists-pinpoint-the-farthest-galaxy |title=Scientists pinpoint the farthest galaxy |publisher=MSNBC |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11580789 |title=Galaxy is most distant object yet |publisher=BBC News |date= 20 October 2010|accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lehnert's team observed the galaxy for 16 hours, and then analysed their results over 2 months,&lt;ref name="DMUK"/&gt; and published their findings in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', in October 2010.&lt;ref name="Lehnert2010"/&gt; 
Since then, more sensitive measurements have failed to replicate the result, suggesting the spectroscopic claim was in error.&lt;ref name="Bunker2013"&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2013MNRAS.430.3314B | title=VLT/XSHOOTER and Subaru/MOIRCS spectroscopy of HUDF.YD3: no evidence for Lyman alpha emission at z = 8.55 | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=430 | issue=4 | page=3314 | year=2013 | author=Bunker, Andrew J. | author2=Caruana, Joseph | author3=Wilkins, Stephen M. | author4=Stanway, Elizabeth R. | author5=Lorenzoni, Silvio | author6=Lacy, Mark | author7=Jarvis, Matt J. | author8=Hickey, Samantha | doi=10.1093/mnras/stt132|arxiv = 1301.4477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
The galaxy is located in the constellation [[Fornax]], and is estimated to have contained roughly a billion [[star]]s,&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trenti|first=Michele|title=Astronomy: Galaxy sets distance mark|journal=Nature|volume=467|issue=7318|pages=924–925|date=2010|pmid=20962835|doi=10.1038/467924a|bibcode = 2010Natur.467..924T }}&lt;/ref&gt;  although it was only at most one tenth of the diameter of our own galaxy, the [[Milky Way]], and had less than 1% of the mass of the Milky Way's stars. According to Lehnert (of the [[Observatoire de Paris]]), it was forming the same number of stars per year as our galaxy, but they were much smaller and less massive, making it "intensely star forming".&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite news |title=Earliest galaxy helped clear Big Bang's fog |publisher=USAToday |date=2010-10-20 |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2010/10/earliest-galaxy-hubble/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The light travel distance of the light that we observe from UDFy-38135539 (HUF.YD3) is more than 4 billion [[parsec]]s&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; (13.1 billion [[light year]]s), and it has a [[luminosity distance]] of 86.9 billion parsecs (about 283 billion light years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lehnert|url=http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1041/eso1041.pdf|first1=M.

The luminosity distance ''D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is related to a factor called the "comoving transverse distance" ''D&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' by the equation {{nowrap|''D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} (1 + ''z'') ''D&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, where ''z'' is the redshift, and the comoving transverse distance is itself equal to the radial comoving distance (i.e., comoving distance between an object and ourselves) in a spatially flat universe.&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielli, Andrea.

The infrared light that we now observe from the galaxy was emitted as ultraviolet radiation toward the end of an era when the universe was filled with atomic hydrogen, which absorbed at ultraviolet wavelengths. Because the galaxy's own light alone would not have been intense enough to ionize a large region and render it transparent, scientists suspect that a population of smaller, undetected galaxies, contributed to the reionization making UDFy-38135539 visible.&lt;ref name="DMUK"/&gt;

== Significance ==
[[File:Hubble Ultra Deep Field diagram.jpg|thumb|300px|upright|Hubble looking into the past.]]

The period of universal star birth was the [[reionization]] epoch. The universe's first stars were massive, 
ionizing hydrogen in the surrounding environment (''Trenti'').&lt;ref name="Discovery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/oldest-galaxy-universe-hubble.html |title=Oldest Object in Universe Found |publisher=Discovery News |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Amos - 20 October 2010 - [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11580789 BBC News] Retrieved 2012-6-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MIT Haystack observatory - [http://www.haystack.mit.edu/ast/science/epoch/index.html ''index''] Retrieved 2012-06-18&lt;/ref&gt;

UDFy-38135539 (HUDF.YD3) is thought to be one of the first galaxies observed in the reionization epoch.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt; [[Caltech]] astronomer Brant Robertson, commenting on the study, stated that the "galaxy happens to reside at a very special time in cosmic history when the properties of gas in the universe were changing rapidly, and therefore this galaxy and others like it may teach us a lot about the early history of the universe".&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt; Michele Trenti, an astronomer who was not involved in the study but provided commentary published with the report, says that the discovery of the distant galaxy represents a 

{{quote|... fundamental leap forward in observational cosmology ...&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt;}}

== Subsequent discoveries ==
Scientists hope to find older galaxies; however, closer to the Big Bang, fewer exist and they are dimmer on average. They will therefore be increasingly difficult to find, since they would be very faint with fewer observable stars.&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt;  Trenti says that new "most distant" record holders will soon be announced, but only incremental distance gains will be realized until NASA's [[James Webb Space Telescope]] becomes operational in 2021.

The James Webb telescope should be able to detect galaxies more than 13.4 billion light years away, less than 300 million years after the Big Bang. Bremer states that it, and eventually the [[European Extremely Large Telescope]], which will have a mirror five times the diameter of Yepun's,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; and is tentatively scheduled for first light in 2024, will enable more detailed study of galaxies at such great distances.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/8075703/Most-distant-galaxy-identified.html |title=Most distant galaxy identified |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= 20 October 2010|accessdate=2010-10-21 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lehnert states that this discovery is not "the limit, perhaps not even that close to it".

At that time, Trenti said redshift 8.6 would likely to be as high as we can reach with the current generation of Earth-bound telescopes, but that with Hubble, "it might be possible to find some galaxies up to redshift 10".&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt; Candidates with higher redshifts than UDFy-38135539's have been reported subsequently, but not yet confirmed with light spectrum instruments.,&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt; for example [[UDFj-39546284]] and [[MACS0647-JD]].

* [[GRB 090423]] is a gamma ray burst, which previously held the record for most distant object, and remains the most distant object with a spectroscopic redshift.
* [[IOK-1]] is the previous record holder for the commonly accepted most distant galaxy.
* The methods used to determine the distances to very distant cosmic objects are described in the "[[Cosmic distance ladder]]"

==Career==
Wang was a captain in the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]].&lt;ref name="spacefacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/international/english/wang_yaping.htm|title=Taikonaut (yuhangyuan) Biography: Wang Yaping|first=Joachim|last=Becker|website=Spacefacts.de|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a candidate for the space mission [[Shenzhou 9]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/jason-davis/china-readies-three.html|title=China readies three taikonauts for station visit|publisher=Planetary Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Liu Yang (astronaut)|Liu Yang]] was selected over her for the historic mission of the first Chinese female space traveller.&lt;ref name=Space.com-2012-06-15/&gt; Wang was a member of the backup crew for SZ-9.&lt;ref name=SpaceDaily2013April03&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Shenzhous_Shadow_Crew_999.html |title= Shenzhou's Shadow Crew |author= Morris Jones |date= 3 April 2013 |publisher= Space Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wang became the second Chinese female astronaut as a member of the [[Shenzhou 10]] spaceship crew, which orbited the earth in June 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chinese astronauts complete space mission, return to Earth |author=William Harwood |newspaper=[[CBS News]] |date=June 25, 2013 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57591038/ |accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[Tiangong-1]] orbiting space station with which it docked.&lt;ref name="XinhuaJune10"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-06/10/c_132446006.htm | title=China to launch Shenzhou-10 manned spacecraft on June 11 | publisher=Xinhua | date=June 10, 2012 | accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first member of the crew announced, in April, while the remainder of the crew were announced in June.&lt;ref name=SpaceDaily2013April03/&gt; Wang Yaping was one of two women in space on the 50th anniversary of [[Vostok 6]], the first spaceflight by a woman, [[Valentina Tereshkova]]. The other woman in space on 16 June 2013 was [[Karen Nyberg]], an American astronaut aboard the International Space Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[Universe Today]] |date= 16 June 2013 |title= Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova; 1st Woman in Space 50 Years Ago!

==Controversy==
According to the official Shenzhou 10 report, Wang Yaping's birth date is stated as January 1980, which is incongruent with that of the Shenzhou 9 report. In the previous report, her birth date was April 1978.&lt;ref name=CNTV&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.cntv.cn/special/shenzhou9/female/index.shtml | title=Female Astronaut - Shenzhou 9 Docking Mission with Tiangong-1 | publisher=[[China Network Television]] | accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Wang is married, which one former official claimed is required for all women who are part of the Chinese space program due to concerns that spaceflight could potentially harm women's fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brenhouse|first1=Hillary|title=China's Female Astronauts: Must Be a Married Mom|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1974793,00.html|website=TIME|date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Space.com-2012-06-15&gt;Space.com, [http://www.space.com/16158-china-female-astronaut-crew-shenzhou-9.html "China Unveils Astronaut Crew, 1st Female Spaceflyer, for Saturday Launch"], 15 June 2012, Clara Moskowitz&lt;/ref&gt; However, this requirement has been officially denied by the director of the China Astronaut Centre, stating that this is a preference but not a strict limitation.&lt;ref name="Want China Times"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20120616000087&amp;cid=1304 | title=For Liu Yang, sexism is still the final frontier | accessdate=June 17, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620094637/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20120616000087&amp;cid=1304 | archivedate=June 20, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wu Bin interview "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/newsupdate/20120616/107007.shtml | title=Exclusive interview: Astronauts selection process | publisher=[[CNTV]] | work=CCTV News | date=June 16, 2012 | accessdate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
