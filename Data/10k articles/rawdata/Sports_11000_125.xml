'''Athletic Park''' was a [[sports]] [[stadium]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] which opened in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=History of New Orleans Baseball|publisher=neworleansbaseball.com|url=http://www.neworleansbaseball.com/history.html|accessdate=2015-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=New Orleans|publisher=southernassociationbaseball.com/|url=http://www.southernassociationbaseball.com/teams/neworleans.php|accessdate=2015-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballpark was located on the south side of Tulane Avenue between South Carrollton Avenue and South Pierce Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=New Orleans Baseball History|publisher=milb.com|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20070130&amp;content_id=41061416&amp;sid=t588&amp;vkey=team4|accessdate=2015-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Pelicans moved a few blocks up the street to [[Pelican Park (New Orleans)|Pelican Park]], this site was replaced by an amusement park called [[White City (New Orleans)|White City]]. The Pelicans would move back to this lot a few years later and build a new facility called [[Pelican Stadium|Heinemann Park]].

It was home to the [[New Orleans Pelicans (baseball)|New Orleans Pelicans]] baseball organization from 1901-1908. It was also home to the [[Tulane Green Wave football]] team from 1901 to 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The History of Tulane Stadium(s)|publisher=bestofneworleans.com|url=https://m.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/the-history-of-tulane-stadiums/Content?oid=2028941|accessdate=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Azerbaijan Supercup'''  ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Milli Futbol Superkuboku}}) is a [[Association football|football]] competition, held at the beginning of each domestic season and disputed between the winners of the [[Azerbaijan Premier League]] and the winners of the [[Azerbaijan Cup]].

==History==
[[Neftchi Baku PFK|Neftchi Baku]] holds the record for winning the Supercup the most times, winning it two times since the competition began in 1993. In 1994, [[Qarabağ FK|Qarabağ]] were awarded automatically with the Supercup after the team won both the domestic title and the Azerbaijan Cup.

In 2013, the Professional Football League of Azerbaijan decided to restore the Azerbaijan Supercup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Суперкубок Азербайджана разыграют в июне|url=http://www.azerisport.com/football/20130309041824888.html|work=Azerisport.com|accessdate=9 March 2013|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:ПФЛ определила дату и место проведения матча за Суперкубок Азербайджана|url=http://azerisport.com/football/20131008073717214.html|work=Azerisport.com|accessdate=9 October 2013|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FK Khazar Lankaran|Khazar Lankaran]] were the first winners of the restored Supercup.&lt;ref&gt;https://int.soccerway.com/national/azerbaijan/super-cup/20132014/s8853/final-stages/&lt;/ref&gt;

The DPRK Golf Open is an annual amateur event which takes place outside [[Pyongyang]]. It was launched in 2011 at North Korea's only open [[golf]] course.

The Open is a 36-hole tournament, with format varying each year.

==History==
North Korea currently has two golf courses, one of them the currently out-of-use course at [[Mount Kumgang]] and the other, the [[Pyongyang Golf Course|Pyongyang Golf Club]] situated 27&amp;nbsp;km from [[Pyongyang]] city.

The Pyongyang Golf Complex was designed and built in 1987 by a Japanese company. The course is mainly played by diplomatic staff.

In 2004, [[Koryo Tours]] hosted the Pyongyang Friendship Golf Tournament. It was a 9-hole event played by 8 competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golfdigest.com/golf-tours-news/blogs/local-knowledge/2011/01/with-talk-of-another-north-korean-open-a-strange-trip-revisi.html |title=2004 event |work=Golf Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, [[North Korea]] announced that they would host the first-ever fully fledged 18-hole international affair. In conjunction with UK travel agency Lupine Travel the DPRK Golf Open was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1346713/Watch-bunkers-Five-day-golf-trip-sale-play-North-Koreas-course.html|title=2011 tournament launch |work=Daily Mail | location=London |date=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records==

The lowest gross score shot during the tournament is 70 by Claudio Consul in 2015. It has been claimed by a Pyongyang Golf Club professional that [[Kim Jong Il]] shot a course record of 34 sometime in the early 1990s, including 5 holes in one. This was stated to Eric Ellis, a reporter for the [[Australian Financial Review]] who visited the club in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ericellis.com/archivenorthkorea1-htm/ |title=Dear Leader and The Golf War |last1=Ellis |first1=Eric|date=22 October 2012 |website=ericellis.com |publisher=Eric Ellis  |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has yet to be confirmed by a credible source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/sports/remembering-kim-jong-ils-ventures-into-the-sporting-world.html?_r=0|title=Kim Jong Il golf record |work=NY Times | first=Jeré |last=Longman |date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Davenport Field at Disharoon Park''' is a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].  It is the home field of the [[University of Virginia]] Cavaliers [[college baseball]] team.  The stadium has a capacity of 5,074&lt;ref name=capacity&gt;{{cite web|title=More General Admission Seats Added at Davenport Field|url=http://www.virginiasports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=88831&amp;SPID=10613&amp;DB_OEM_ID=17800&amp;ATCLID=205147474|publisher=virginiasports.com|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened in 2002.  It is named after former Virginia Student Aid Foundation executive director [[Ted Davenport]].

==Opening Day==
On February 16, 2002, the University of Virginia baseball program defeated the [[Bucknell University|Bucknell Bison]] 10-3 in the first ever contest played at the brand new UVA Baseball Stadium. Virginia opened the door on its new multimillion-dollar facility for the 2002 season.

==Renovations==
The UVA Baseball Stadium has been through a series of improvements over its tenure as the home to the Virginia Cavaliers, but none like the upgrades and renovations that have taken place in recent years.

Improvements to the stadium include: a canopied grandstand with 1,500 seats; an additional 500 seats and a grass hillside to provide more seating; six sky boxes for lease by fans and corporate sponsors; stadium lights; new dugouts for the home and visiting teams; an on-site locker room and club house; a new press box, and a new concession area.

Representing a major athletic facility improvement, the University of Virginia installed a new grass playing surface at the then UVA Baseball Field in 1998. The Bermuda grass playing surface - known as Davenport Field - was dedicated on Saturday, April 13, 2002 during Virginia's second contest of a three-game series against the Wake Forest Demon Deacons.

Following the 2005 season, the left field wall was shortened and moved inward to decrease the distance down the line by 17 feet.  The right field was not adjusted as the stadium dimensions became asymmetrical for 2006.

Following the 2006 season, a new scoreboard featuring a video system similar to the ones at the [[John Paul Jones Arena]] and [[Klockner Stadium]] was installed at Davenport Field.  The right field wall was adjusted in association with the project, resulting in a return to symmetrical field dimensions for 2007.

Prior to the 2010 season, a new set of facilities under the stadium were constructed, including an on-site visitors' clubhouse, umpire room, coaches' office.  A hall of fame dedicated to baseball will also be constructed in the same space.

During the 2010 season, the [[seating capacity]] of Davenport Field was progressively increased with the addition of 3 sets of temporary bleachers.  This expanded the facility's official capacity from 3,600 to 4,825, with the final addition occurring prior to the school's final ACC series at home versus [[North Carolina Tar Heels baseball|North Carolina]].

Prior to the May 13, 2011, series versus [[Miami Hurricanes baseball|Miami]], 249 General Admission seats were added behind the right field wall increasing the stadium's capacity to 5,074.&lt;ref name="capacity" /&gt;

Prior to the 2013 season, 6 grandstand sections with aluminum bleacher seating were converted to chairback seating, resulting in a reduction of stadium capacity to 4,980.

A new club seating area called the Clubhouse was added to Davenport Field prior to the 2014 season. Located in left-center field, the Clubhouse includes an indoor, climate-controlled area with a cash bar, seating and TVs as well as 65 outdoor chairback seats.

Davenport Field was expanded during the 2017 offseason to include a new grand entry in right field, an extended concourse with permanent chair back seats along the third base line, a field-level club area with seating for up to 140 fans, and new concessions, merchandise, and restroom facilities. The newly renovated stadium includes new areas for player training and development, a new pitching development center, and new offices for the coaches.  The new official capacity is approximately 5,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uvabaseballrenovation.com/|title=Home - Davenport Field Expansion|website=uvabaseballrenovation.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the February 21, 2018 home opener against [[VMI Keydets baseball|VMI]], the university announced that following a donation, the official stadium name would change to '''Davenport Field and Disharoon Park'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richmond.com/sports/college/schools/university-virginia/uva-renames-expanded-baseball-stadium-davenport-field-at-disharoon-park/article_4ab1ce17-b21c-53ed-87ec-fc49ff25b337.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Expanded scheduling==
The new ballpark has enabled Virginia to schedule games against nationally prominent teams that previously would have been played on the road. "This will increase the opportunity for television game coverage," said [[Craig Littlepage]], UVA athletic director. "Adding stadium lighting will allow our team to play or practice at night and thus miss fewer classes. In addition, the facility will become a community asset, offering a potential venue for high school tournaments and adult-league games."

==Namesake==
The field was named in honor of Thomas "Ted" Edward Davenport who served the University of Virginia as Executive Director and Secretary/Treasurer of the Virginia Student Aid Foundation (VSAF) from 1958 until 1988. He was a dear friend and avid fan of the university until his death in 2001. A 1953 graduate of the [[Curry School of Education]], Davenport was instrumental in increasing the donations and donors to the annual fund and leading capital funding efforts for the athletics program during his tenure. He served the university in several capacities including head baseball coach and head golf coach.

The '''Indonesia national cricket team''' is the team that represents the country of [[Indonesia]] in [[international cricket]]. [[Cricket in Indonesia]] is governed by [[Cricket Indonesia]] (formerly the Indonesia Cricket Foundation). Cricket Indonesia became an affiliate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) in 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Countries/59.html&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[ICC members|associate member]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="Assoc"/&gt;

Cricket Indonesia is charged with the promotion and development of cricket in Indonesia, and is a member of the [[ICC East Asia-Pacific]] (EAP) development region. In 2006, the organisation announced their intention to join the [[Asian Cricket Council]], and were originally included in the draw for the [[ACC Trophy]], although their membership of the ACC was rejected and they did not take part in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiancricket.org/h_0506_trophy.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821054437/http://www.asiancricket.org/h_0506_trophy.cfm |archivedate=21 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indonesian national team made its international debut in 2002, at a tournament in [[Perth]], [[Australia]], that also included [[Japan national cricket team|Japan]] and [[South Korea national cricket team|South Korea]]. The team's first ICC event was the [[2005 ICC EAP Cricket Cup|2005 EAP Cup]] in Vanuatu, where it placed fifth out of six teams. Indonesia has since regularly participated in EAP regional tournaments. At [[2014 ICC East Asia-Pacific Men's Championship|2014 EAP Championship]], the most recent such event, Indonesia placed seventh out of eight teams, in front of only the [[Cook Islands national cricket team|Cook Islands]].

In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full [[Twenty20 International]] (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all [[Twenty20]] matches played between Indonesia and other [[List of International Cricket Council members|ICC members]] after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/672322|title=All T20 matches between ICC members to get international status|work=[[International Cricket Council]]|date=26 April 2018|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===21st century===
Since the Indonesian Cricket Foundation (now [[Cricket Indonesia]]) was formed in 2000, Indonesia have played in several regional tournaments in the East Asia-Pacific region. Including the East-Asia Pacific Challenge in 2004, and in the [[2005 ICC EAP Cricket Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100831031607/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/icc_members/profile.php |title=ICC, Accessed 19 May 2011 |date=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Indonesia won a bronze medal in the 20-over tournament in [[cricket at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games]]. They also played in the 50-over tournament, but lost all four matches (including to [[Myanmar national cricket team|Myanmar]], giving that country its first victory in international cricket).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6845">The '''infield shift''' is a generic term used in [[baseball]] to describe a defensive realignment from the standard positions to blanket one side of the field or another. Used primarily against left-handed batters, it is designed to protect against [[base hit]]s [[Pull hitter|pulled]] hard into the gaps between the fielders on one side.  

Originally called the "[[Lou Boudreau|Boudreau]]" or "Williams" shift, the strategy is often associated with [[Ted Williams]], but it was actually first employed against [[Cy Williams]] during the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zCoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=eddie+yost+baseball+digest&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EH3GTOUch4LhBqS36dsP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=20th Century All-Overlooked Stars |author=Vass, George |publisher=Books.Google.com |date=August 1999 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=24 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4i0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=ken+williams+baseball+digest&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=i8LGTJnfBJyg4Qa7zoDoDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=ken%20williams%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false |title=Baseball's Forgotten Stars |author=Vass, George |publisher=Books.Google.com |date=July 2004 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=24 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later used against Ted Williams during the [[1946 World Series]] between the [[Red Sox]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] as a defensive gimmick by St. Louis manager [[Eddie Dyer]] to psych out and hopefully contain Boston slugger Williams. It was devised by Cleveland Indians manager Lou Boudreau on a blackboard between games of a doubleheader in July 1946 to halt Williams' hot hitting. "I always considered The Boudreau Shift a psychological, rather than a tactical victory," wrote Lou Boudreau in his book, ''Player-Manager''. The shift has been employed since then to thwart extreme [[pull hitter]]s (mostly lefties), such as [[Barry Bonds]], [[Ryan Howard]], [[Jason Giambi]], [[David Ortiz]], and [[Mark Teixeira]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ryan-howards-career-is-dead-the-shift-killed-it/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ahead-of-their-time-why-baseball-revived-a-60-year-old-strategy-designed-to-stop-ted-williams/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically the [[third baseman]] moves to the left where the shortstop plays; the [[shortstop]] plays to the right of second; the [[second baseman]] plays between first and second and usually on the [[right field]] grass; the [[center fielder]] plays right-center; and the [[first baseman]] and [[right fielder]] hug the [[Glossary of baseball (F)#foul lines|foul line]]. Sometimes the third baseman, rather than the shortstop, will play to the right of second, allowing the shortstop (usually the team's best infielder) to remain near their usual position. While this is the most common type of defensive shift seen in baseball, there are numerous variations that can be implemented according to the hitting ability of the batter.  For example, an effective defensive shift against [[Joe Mauer]] would have the infield shifted for a pull-happy left hander, and the outfield shifted for a pull-happy right-hander, due to Mauer's tendency to pull nearly all of his groundballs, and hit nearly all of his flyballs to the opposite field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/mauers-split/ |title=Mauer’s Splits &amp;#124; FanGraphs Baseball |publisher=Fangraphs.com |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drawbacks to the shift==
With the infield shift becoming more common in recent years, the tactic's drawbacks have become more apparent.  
=== Stolen bases, or extra bases, on a shift ===
* In the [[2009 World Series]], [[Johnny Damon]] of the [[New York Yankees]] stole two bases on one pitch against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] due to an infield shift: Damon stole second, and, after the third baseman covered second and was pulled away from the base, immediately headed for the uncovered third base. 
* In regular-season play, multiple [[Boston Red Sox]] players have taken advantage of infield shifts to either steal multiple bases, or advance multiple bases, on an infield shift.
** On August 9, 2014, in a game at [[Angel Stadium]], Red Sox second baseman [[Dustin Pedroia]] stole second and then stole third with no one covering.
** On April 13, 2015, in a home game against the [[Washington Nationals]], Red Sox outfielder [[Mookie Betts]] stole second base, and then noticing no one covering third base, beat Nationals pitcher [[Jordan Zimmermann]] to third base
** On May 6, 2016, in a game at [[Yankee Stadium]], with first base open and the Yankees electing to keep an infield shift on, Red Sox shortstop [[Xander Bogaerts]] stole third base unchallenged because the third baseman was playing at the shortstop position.
** On June 11, 2016, in a game at [[Target Field]], Bogaerts again took advantage of a shift deployed with [[David Ortiz]] batting, going from first to third on a groundout against the shift. Because no one was covering third, combined with Bogaerts' speed, the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins']] attempt to turn a double play was unsuccessful (the throw to force Bogaerts at second was late as Bogaerts had already passed second base), and while the throw back to first base retired Ortiz, Bogaerts again reached third base unchallenged.
* In the [[2015 National League Championship Series]], on a walk to [[Lucas Duda]], [[Daniel Murphy (baseball)|Daniel Murphy]] stole third base on a walk because no one was covering third.

In such a case, it is necessary for either the pitcher or catcher to cover third to prevent two steals by one player on the same play if the steal of second is successful, with the player not covering third covering home plate.

=== Bunts for extra bases on a shift ===
*On May 3, 1970, in a home game against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[Willie McCovey]] of the [[San Francisco Giants]] bunted hard down the third base line when the shift was on. With no one covering third,  [[Willie Mays]], on first at the time, came all the way around to score, while McCovey reached second for a double.&lt;ref&gt;Neyer, Rob. ''Rob Neyer's Big Book of Baseball Legends''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On September 13, 2013, on a play similar to McCovey's, but with the bases empty, in a road game against the [[Boston Red Sox]], [[New York Yankees]] second baseman [[Robinson Cano]] bunted against the shift for a double.

'''Jack Kaiser Stadium''', originally known as '''The Ballpark at St. Johns''', is a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] located on the campus of [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]] near the neighborhoods of [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] and [[Fresh Meadows, Queens|Fresh Meadows]] in New York City. Formerly used by the now-defunct [[Queens Kings]] [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] team in its inaugural season of 2000,&lt;ref name=NYTimes-SJUpark-suit-2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=RedStorm-JackKaiserStadium /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-QnsKings-Opener-2000&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kepner|first1=Tyler|title=BASEBALL: METS NOTEBOOK; Opener Set For Queens Ball Team|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/19/sports/baseball-mets-notebook-opener-set-for-queens-ball-team.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=23 May 2015|date=May 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is currently used by the St. John's [[St. John's Red Storm#Baseball|Red Storm Baseball Team]].

==History==
After the 1999 season, the [[New York Mets]] purchased the [[St. Catharines Blue Jays|St. Catharines Stompers]] of the [[New York–Penn League]], planning to move them from Ontario to Brooklyn. However, the stadium for the newly minted [[Brooklyn Cyclones]] would not be ready until 2001 (nor would their affiliation contract with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] expire until then), so the Mets decided to "park" the franchise in [[Queens]] for the 2000 season, dubbing them the [[Queens Kings]]. Striking a deal with [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]], the Mets built a ballpark for the Kings, then donated it to the school and the [[St. John's Red Storm|Red Storm]] [[college baseball]] team, which plays in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] of the [[NCAA]].  In 2007, the stadium was named for St. John's All-American baseball player [[Jack Kaiser|John W. "Jack" Kaiser]]. Kaiser, who played in the late 1940s, was head coach of the baseball team from 1956–1973, athletic director from 1973–1995, and is currently emeritus athletic director at St. John's University.&lt;ref name=RedStorm-JackKaiserStadium&gt;{{cite web|title=Facilities: Jack Kaiser Stadium|url=http://www.redstormsports.com/facilities/stjo-ballpark.html|website=[[St. John's Red Storm|redstormsports.com]]|publisher=[[St. John's Red Storm]], [[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium holds 3,500 people.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-SJUpark-suit-2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=RedStorm-JackKaiserStadium /&gt;

'''Dunham Field at O'Harra Memorial Stadium''' is a multi-purpose stadium located on the campus of the [[South Dakota School of Mines &amp; Technology]] (SDSM&amp;T) in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]], [[South Dakota]]. It is the home of the [[South Dakota Mines Hardrockers football]] team, as well as Rapid City's two public [[high schools]] ([[Central High School (Rapid City, South Dakota)|Central]] and [[Stevens High School (South Dakota)|Stevens]]). The stadium is named after SDSM&amp;T's eighth president, Dr. Cleophas C. O'Harra (who also decided where the stadium should be), and field is named after two alumni boosters, George &amp; Nancy Dunham.

The stadium is noted for being one-of-a-kind in its design, consisting of standard [[bleacher]] and [[Press box|box seating]] to one side and a three-tiered terrace on the opposite side, consisting of 250 paved parking spots allowing spectators to [[Tailgate party|tailgate]] and watch games from their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youvisit.com/tour/sdsmt?loc=trail4:0:1:1&amp;pl=v&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://gorockers.com/facilities/?id=4&lt;/ref&gt; A track also encircles the field, allowing its use for [[track and field]] events.

==History==
In 1930, the School of Mines obtained an area southeast of SDSM&amp;T campus that was previous used as a garbage dump and feeding area for swine, based on suggestions from landscape artist Phelps Myman.&lt;ref&gt;http://gorockers.com/facilities/?id=4&lt;/ref&gt; That year's pledges to [[Sigma Tau]] were then tasked with designing the field and stadium. President O’Harra declared a holiday for students on May 18, 1931, allowing the student body to come and level the field ''en masse'', in preparation for proper construction. Work between 1932 until its completion in 1938 was done by a mixture of unskilled workers from the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) and skilled laborers paid by donations collected by the school's alumni association.&lt;ref&gt;http://dlsd.sdln.net/cdm/singleitem/collection/newssdsmt/id/1110/rec/6&lt;/ref&gt;

Work was completed and the stadium dedicated on September 16, 1938; the Hardrocker's first home game on that day O'Harra was a 18–7 victory over the [[South Dakota State Jackrabbits football|South Dakota State Jackrabbits]]. The Hardrockers finished the season 8–0 (after a forfeit by [[Yankton College]]) and won that year's conference championship.&lt;ref&gt;http://dlsd.sdln.net/cdm/singleitem/collection/newssdsmt/id/1110/rec/6&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium underwent $1,750,000 worth of expansion and modernization in later years through support by various state, city, county, and school entities. The field was named Dunham Field in 2004. A further $2.5 million in renovations to O'Harra were proposed in September 2016 and slated for Summer 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sdsmt.edu/News/Vision-Funds-Proposal-Details-Improvements-for-O-Harra-Stadium/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Power o.jpg|thumb|Diagram of an off-tackle play.]]
An '''off-tackle run''' in [[American football]] is a [[American football plays|play]] in which the [[running back]] carries the ball through a running lane off of the [[tackle (American football position)|tackle]]'s block.  The lead [[blocking (American football)|block]] kicks out the end man on the line of scrimmage, and another offensive player usually blocks the linebacker. It can be useful in short yardage situations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1JSk1GjlEEC|title=Football's Best Offensive Playbook|first=Dwight|last=Hawkes|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Human Kinetics|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with large backs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KI3ZgdWCT_cC|title=A Football All-Pro|first=Scott|last=Ingram|date=1 June 2004|publisher=Heinemann-Raintree Library|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most simple form of this play has the strong side offensive lineman step towards the ball and block any defender inside of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbduM8Jyc34C|title=Football For Dummies|first1=Howie|last1=Long|first2=John|last2=Czarnecki|date=8 March 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] will kick out the end man to create the running lane for the ball carrier. The Maryland I used the 2nd back to lead through the hole and block the linebacker. More complicated versions of the play have [[American football plays#Offensive Plays|pulling]] [[guard (American football)|guard]]s block the linebacker or combination blocks by a tight-end and tackle to create the hole and block the linebacker.

==History==
The off-tackle play is a key feature of the [[single wing formation|single wing]] offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4kZXAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=|page=104|title=Modern Single Wing Football|author=Charles W. Caldwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Professional Dart Players Association (PDPA)''' is an organisation for professional dart players within the '''Professional Darts Corporation (PDC)''' Its intention is to look after the interests of all professional players through an annually elected Board of six current professionals. They work in partnership with the PDC (Promoter) and its governing body (DRA)

==Formation==
The PDPA was initially formed in the early 1980s with the main protagonists being [[John Lowe]], [[Cliff Lazarenko]], [[Dave Whitcombe]] and [[Tony Brown (darts player)|Tony Brown]]. As darts was beginning to decline, players from the PDPA eventually set up the World Darts Council (which is now the [[Professional Darts Corporation]]) to run their own tournaments. The PDPA remained effectively a players union.

==Current board and fees==
The six board members are [[Peter Manley]] (chairman), [[Alan Warriner-Little]] (ceo), Andrew Scott and Jacques Nieuwlaat. With administrative and secretarial support from Zoe Banks.

Membership of the PDPA is open to all players of the appropriate standard, but have to first enter its annual Qualifying School every January to try and win a PDC Tour Card. The initial joining fee for Qualifying School is £250 with an upgrade fee of £250 if a Tour Card is won (full membership is £500). There are around 600 members of the PDPA, with 128 Tour Card Holders, 350 Associate Members, 200 Youth Members and 200 European Day Member's. All Tour Card Holders have the right to qualify and play in PDC Premier televised tournaments with other members via qualifiers or related merit tables.

The [[William Hill (bookmaker)|William Hill]] [[PDC World Darts Championship|World Darts Championship]], [[Ladbrokes]] [[World Series of Darts (tour)|World Series]] and [[bwin]] [[Grand Slam of Darts]] have qualifiers which are exclusive to Tour Card Holders with all PDPA members eligible to play in the PDC World Darts Championship qualifier.

The '''Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Amendment (Scotland) Act''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] which amends section 7(4) of the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 in respect of rights of several fishery.

==Background==
The original Bill was introduced in the Scottish Parliament on 8 March 2000 by [[Tavish Scott]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]]. The existing Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 required that a shellfish farmer seeking a Several Order to allow them to control an area of seabed on which to farm shellfish frequently encountered opposition from fishermen who fish in the area to be covered by the Order. If the Several Order was issued, all fishing was banned within the area covered, regardless of whether or not the fishing operations damaged the interests of the shellfish farmer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/bills/billsPassed/b11s1fm.pdf ''Financial Memorandum''], Scottish Parliament, 8 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment to the 1967 Act allows Scottish Ministers making a Several Order to authorise the continuation of specified non-damaging fishing operations
within the area covered by the Order. The aim of the Bill was thus to avoid unnecessary and avoidable conflicts of interests between shellfish farmers and fishermen.

==Provision==
The purpose of the Bill was to permit Scottish Ministers to authorise the use by fishermen of non-damaging types of fishing gear such as creels in areas covered by Several
Fisheries Orders. Thus, in section 7 of the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 (c.83) (protection of fisheries), in subsection (4)(a), after sub-paragraph (ii) there was inserted:

"or

(iii) in the case of several fishery, an implement of a type specified in the order and so used as not to disturb or injure in any manner shellfish of the description in question."

== Passage through Parliament==
The Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Amendment (Scotland) Act 2000 asp 12 was passed by the [[Scottish Parliament]] on 28 September 2000. The bill was given the [[Royal Assent]] on 2 November 2000.

{{nihongo|'''Shoot boxing'''|シュートボクシング|Shūtobokushingu}} is both a [[combat sport]] and a [[stand-up fighting]] [[promoter (entertainment)|promotion company]] based in Tokyo, Japan. The organization was founded by former kickboxer [[Caesar Takeshi]] in 1985.

Shootboxing is a mixture of its two parent combat styles of [[shoot wrestling]] and [[kickboxing]], allowing for [[kick]]s, [[punch (combat)|punch]]es, [[knee (strike)|knees]], [[elbow (strike)|elbows]], [[throw (grappling)|throws]], and [[standing]] submissions ([[chokehold]]s, [[armlock]]s and [[wristlock]]s).

== History ==
Shoot boxing (commonly written as '''Shootboxing''') was created in August 1985 by former kickboxer [[Caesar Takeshi]]. The first Shootboxing event took place on September 1, 1985.

Some mixed martial artists such as [[Hayato Sakurai]] began their careers in Shootboxing. Shootboxing has also drawn fighters who became famous in other promotions such as [[Jens Pulver]]. Many K-1 World MAX stars also either debuted in Shootboxing or have fought for Shootboxing in the past, including [[Andy Souwer]], [[Albert Kraus]], and [[Buakaw Por. Pramuk]].

==S-Cup World Champions==
S-Cup, the Shoot Boxing World Cup, is the 8 man single elimination World Tournament generally held once every 2 years since 1995.

== Match judgment ==
One way to win a shoot boxing match is to knock one's opponent out.  A fighter can be knocked out in different ways.  If, after being knocked down, a fighter fails to stand up after a count of ten, or if, after standing up, he fails to assume a fighting stance after a count of eight, he is knocked out.  The same occurs if a fighter is knocked out of the ring and fails to return before a count of twenty.  A referee may also rule a fighter knocked out if the fighter shows no fighting spirit, appears unable to defend his or her self, or makes a gesture of submission.

Technical knockouts can also occur in shoot boxing, in cases where the fighter is injured, the referee rules the fighter knocked out after two knockdowns in the same round, or the fighter's corner throws in the towel.  A fight may also be stopped if a doctor rules that continuation would be dangerous to a fighter.

If neither a knockout nor a technical knockout occurs, the winner is determined by a decision.  Fighters are graded on their effectiveness on attack and defense, their success in achieving and escaping submissions, and how close they have come to ending the match.  Decisions generally produce a winner, but can result in a draw.

A judgement of "no contest" may also be returned, if the judges suspect foul play or conclude that the fighters are not fighting sincerely.

== Grading ==
Fighters are awarded points for their success in striking, throwing, and applying standing submission holds to their opponent.  They are also given points for four categories of performance: number of times down, amount of damage done to opponent, number of clean hits, and aggressiveness.  Fighters are graded from 1-10 in each category, with the difference of score in any one category being limited to 4 points.

Extra points can be awarded at certain points in the match, when the referee makes certain calls.  When a fighter performs a front or back throwing technique, the referee calls "shoot", denoting one of these opportunities.  The other occurs when a fighter achieves a standing submission; at this point, the referee calls "catch".

== Fouls ==
Foul play is recognized as the following ① to ⑬.  After a warning, the fighter will receive a point deduction for further infractions.  If the same fighter commits another foul, another point is deducted, and a final warning is given. If a third warning is given to the same fighter, he is disqualified and loses the fight.
If the referee feels that it was not a flagrant foul, he may allow the fight to continue.
*1:[[Headbutt]]ing the opponent.
*2:Striking the opponent in the groin.
*3:Biting the opponent.
*4:Attacking the opponent while he is falling, or when he is getting up.
*5:Attacking an opponent after the referee signals for a break.
*6:Utilizing the ropes to aid one's offense or defense.
*7:To insult or use offensive speech and actions towards an opponent or the referee.
*8:Striking the opponent in the back of the head.
*9:The act of intentionally grounding a glove or knee to the mat to defend an attack.
*10:Intentionally causing the opponent to fall out of the ring.
*11:Intentionally leaving the ring.
*12:It makes everything of the act of not being admitted by the other rule foul play.
**a) If a fighter ever accuses the judges of not being impartial, points are to be immediately deducted.
**b) The act of ducking the head low and diving into the opponent in such a manner that appears similar to a headbutt.
When either fighter receives a cut from a headbutt, the fighter that made the cut receives a point deduction, even if the headbutt was accidental.
If the referee decides that the headbutt was intentional, the fighter receives a two-point deduction.
**c) Repeated holding which does not appear to be an attack, nor an attempt to escape attacks, will be subject to point deductions after warnings from the referee.
"An attempt to escape attacks" is defined as the act whose intent is to interrupt the opponent's offense or defense by grappling immediately after an attack.

A fighter will be disqualified in the case of any of the following situations:
*1:When there is intentional foul play, and the referee declares a disqualification for the action.
*2:When the fighter does not obey the referee.
*3:If a fighter cannot continue when the round begins.
*4:When a fighter's attitude is overly rough or violent, with the intent to cause bodily harm above and beyond what is considered to be necessary to compete.
*5:When the referee decides a fighter lacks fighting spirit, or the desire to continue.
*6:When a fighter receives three point deductions in one round.
*7:When a doctor declares a fighter unfit to continue the match.
*8:When violating fight regulations.

'''Skyline Sports Complex''' is a sports complex/stadium on [[City Island (Pennsylvania)|City Island]], along the [[Susquehanna River]], in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].

The original structure was built in 1987 and is adjacent to [[FNB Field]].

The complex/stadium hosts numerous events annually and was the home stadium for the [[Penn FC|Harrisburg City Islanders]] soccer team until 2016. It was formerly home to the Central Penn Piranha football team.

The field was under renovation in 2008, which included repositioning and the planting of new grass, in preparation for the 2009 Islanders' season. The upgrade project was headed by Mayor Stephen R. Reed and completed internally by the City of Harrisburg's Department of Parks and Recreation staff.

==Stadium Expansion/Upgrade==
As of 2015, the parent company of the Harrisburg City Islanders, the Harrisburg Capital Soccer, Inc. have begun applying for grant funding to facilitate upgrades to the existing complex. The proposed upgrades are anticipated to include increasing capacity to 5,000 seats, VIP areas, entrance plaza, upgraded concessions, restrooms, indoor locker rooms, broadcasting booth, and a new scoreboard. New seating is intended to be an upgrade from existing bleachers with a mix of individual bucket seats, ten suites, a VIP deck with seating, and bleacher seats with back supports.&lt;ref&gt;http://cityislanders.com/club-news/harrisburg-city-islanders-take-next-step-in-new-stadium-project/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RheinEnergieStadion Köln 011.jpg|thumb|300px|Terraced at bottom and seating at top at the [[RheinEnergieStadion]] in Germany, home of 2. Bundesliga club [[1. FC Köln]]]]

A '''terrace''' or terracing in sporting  terms refers to the traditional standing area of a sports stadium, particularly in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. A terrace is a series of concrete steps which are erected for spectators to stand on.

Its significance carries particular importance in football where terraces were located in the areas behind the two goals as a cheaper alternative to sitting in the stands, which were traditionally located at the sides of the field. Naturally standing in the terraces was much cheaper than a seat, with the result that over the decades they became the most popular spectators' area for younger working class men and teenage boys to watch the game.

Due to safety concerns related to terraces, they have fallen out of favour in many places.  Terraces were banned from major football grounds in England in the early 1990s, as a result of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], and are currently not used during major tournaments, and for a long time were generally not included in new stadium designs. There is currently a growing demand for a reintroduction of terracing, based on the modern stadium designs in Germany and other European countries, dubbed "[[safe standing]]" areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportshaze.com/england/english-premier-league/should-fans-be-allowed-to-stand-at-a-football-match-2462|title=Sports Haze — Sports News – Sports Opinion – Sports Lifestyle|work=Sports Haze|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321205608/http://sportshaze.com/england/english-premier-league/should-fans-be-allowed-to-stand-at-a-football-match-2462/|archivedate=21 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ireland ==
[[File:Hill16.jpg|right|thumb|200px|View of [[Hill 16]] in [[Croke Park]]]]
In Ireland, terraces are still a common feature in [[gaelic football]], [[hurling]], [[camogie]], [[rugby union]], soccer and other sports. Terraces in Ireland were generally not subject to the same level of violence as those in the United Kingdom, nor were they subject to crowd segregation (with the exception of, occasionally, football) or the [[Taylor Report]] as British terraces were, so terraces remained a common feature in Irish stadia. [[Hill 16]] in [[Croke Park]] is one of the most notable terraces in Ireland.

Terraces have been built or refurbished in ground improvements at many stadia in recent years, including [[Thomond Park]], Croke Park and [[Flancare Park]] (since converted to all-seater); although all new [[League of Ireland]] stands built since Flancare's redevelopment have happened to be all-seater. Also GAA stadiums have terracing including Fitzgerald Stadium and Pearse Park

== United Kingdom ==
=== History ===
In the early days of the twentieth century the terraces were simply earth banks, often built up with the rubble of construction sites. Rows of [[railroad tie|railways sleepers]] were laid on top to provide something solid for spectators to stand on.

Most stadiums in Britain at the turn of the century had [[bleachers]] for spectators, but when a wooden bleacher style terrace at [[Ibrox Park]] collapsed in the [[1902 Ibrox disaster]] killing many spectators during a [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] versus [[England national football team|England]] game there was an instant ban on framework supported terraces, which the government ordered must be replaced by solid earthwork supported terracing.

The earth and sleeper terraces would gradually make way for concrete terraces with metal crush barriers being erected at various points to prevent [[human crush|crushing]]. An excellent example of one such old style terrace can be found at [[Cathkin Park]] in Glasgow, an abandoned football stadium, which was home to [[Third Lanark]].

=== Popularity ===
The terraces were hugely popular in England, particularly from the 1920s to the 1980s, and their working class links led them to be given affectionate names by the fans who stood on them. By far the most common name was ''[[Spion Kop (stadia)|Spion Kop]]'', named after the [[Battle of Spion Kop]] in the [[Boer War]] in South Africa in 1902 between Britain and the Boers. [[Arsenal F.C.]] were the first to adopt such a name but by far the most famous was the Kop at [[Liverpool F.C.]]'s [[Anfield Road]] ground. The vast majority of clubs in England and farther afield would go on to regard their most popular end of their stadium as a Kop, even if, in most cases the end had another name, for example the Holte End at [[Aston Villa F.C.]]'s [[Villa Park]]. The most notable exception to this is [[Everton F.C.]], whose close rivalry with city neighbours Liverpool has meant that neither the club nor its fans would ever refer to the ground as having a Kop section.

The advantage of terracing over seating for clubs was obvious, as many more fans could be packed in tightly into very cramped areas, and it is no coincidence that many clubs' all-time attendance records were set in the 1930s and 40s.

=== Safety ===
[[File:Brunton Park Warwick Road End.jpg|thumb|300px|The Warwick Road End a covered Terrace at [[Brunton Park]], home of [[Carlisle United F.C.]]]]
Terraces were generally a safe, cheap and enjoyable way to watch sport, but on occasion they could be dangerous too.

In the early days the wet railway sleepers would often lead to falls, which quickly led to their replacement but much worse was to follow when thirty-three people lost their lives in 1946 when an overcrowded terrace led to a [[human crush|crush]] at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.]]'s [[Burnden Park]] ground. That such a disaster only occurred once during this era is amazing as it was common in those days to see a fainted fan being passed down the terraces over the heads of those packed in so they could be treated for their ill effects. But there were perhaps more advantages than disadvantages still. The ground fee was low and achievable for all, the singing and cheering was not rarely astonishing, especially where the huge covered ''Goal Stands'' existed. Like [[the Kop]] at [[Anfield Road]], Holte End at [[Villa Park]] and '''North Bank Stand''' at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux Ground]]

By the 1970s the lower cost of travel meant it was easier for fans to have away days, or road trips and a common practice among young visiting fans was to try to "take the terrace". Large bodies of supporters of the visiting team would infiltrate the popular terracing of the home supporters with the result that violence often erupted. This led to crowd segregation at football grounds and also played a small part in the erection of high fencing and segregated pens within most terraces in England.

These pens became a contributing factor in the [[Hillsborough disaster]], England's worst ever stadium disaster, when too many fans entered the central pens at the [[Hillsborough Stadium]] in [[Sheffield]]. 96 [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans were crushed to death against the [[perimeter fence]] in the resultant crush.

Although claiming that terraces were not "intrinsically unsafe", the final [[Taylor Report]] into the disaster led to a recommendation that terraces be done away with at major British stadiums. Today every major British football ground is all-seater, though terracing is still found at grounds in the lower leagues. Britain's biggest remaining terraced ground is [[Brunton Park]] in Carlisle, which still has three sides of terracing.

=== Crowd disorder ===
It has been argued{{Citation needed|reason=by whom?|date=December 2013}} that terraces encourage crowd disorder. However, analysis of statistics on football related arrests and banning orders published by the UK Home Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/football-banning-orders/|title=Crime prevention|work=homeoffice.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that in both the 2008/9 and 2009/10 seasons the rate of arrest per 100,000 supporters was higher at [[Football League One]] and [[Football League Two]] clubs with all-seated grounds than at those with terraces.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;50 Stand Up Sit Down – A Choice to Watch Football. Peter Caton 2012. {{ISBN|978-1-78088-177-5}}. Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt; Overall arrest rates for football related offences have fallen steadily from 34 per 100,000 in 1988/89 to 9 per 100,000 in 2009/10, however the trend of reducing arrests started before stadia were required to become all-seated and has continued since.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

=== Safe standing ===
{{Main|Safe standing}}
In 2011 the [[Scottish Premier League]] announced that their clubs would be given permission to introduce [[safe standing]] areas at their grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16248937.stm|title=Scottish Premier League gives green light for standing areas|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Aston Villa F.C|Aston Villa]] announced they would be looking to install safe standing areas in [[Villa Park]] in time for the 2013–14 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2088004/Aston-Villa-want-safe-standing-area-Villa-Park.html|title=Aston Villa want safe-standing area at Villa Park – Daily Mail Online|date=17 January 2012|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, Derby County became the first club from the Championship to support the introduction of safe standing areas, although the only terraced standing areas in the Championship and/or Barclays Premiership at that time could be found at London Road, home to Peterborough United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safestandingroadshow.co.uk/news/derbycountyandnigelcloughbacksafestanding|title=Derby County &amp; Nigel Clough pro safe standing – Safe Standing Roadshow.co.uk|work=safestandingroadshow.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterborough United became the second Championship club to back the safe standing campaign through their CEO Bob Symns. Symns also signed the safe standing petition.&lt;ref name="safestandingroadshow.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safestandingroadshow.co.uk/news/peterboroughoffertotrialsafestanding|title=Peterborough CEO offers to trial safe standing – Safe Standing Roadshow.co.uk|work=safestandingroadshow.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the club's mascot – Peter Burrow – took part in a video campaign promoting safe standing, with the video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safestandingroadshow.co.uk/news/thesilentmoviepeterburrowsdilemma|title=The Silent Movie: Peter Burrow's Dilemma – Safe Standing Roadshow.co.uk|work=safestandingroadshow.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; being shot at the [[AWD-Arena]], home to [[Hannover 96]] in Germany&lt;ref name="safestandingroadshow.co.uk" /&gt;

== United States ==
Terracing was introduced to [[American football]] with the inclusion of party decks with the ability to hold 35,000 people at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in the [[Dallas]] suburb of [[Arlington, Texas]]. Capacity for [[Dallas Cowboys]] games and other American football events is 80,000 seated, expandable to 111,000 with standing areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/080109dnspocowside.1f521fe.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should be noted that these decks are flat, rather than steeply pitched, and are more analogous to [[standing-room only]] ticketing where obstruction is expected. The key difference is that unlike at European grounds, party decks are not considered or marketed as areas from which all spectators are afforded a view of the match at all times.

Many seats in [[FedExField]], home of the [[Washington Redskins]], have been removed in favor of terraced party decks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8280cb76/article/redskins-stadium-to-feature-standingroom-only-party-deck&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redskins.com/media-gallery/photo-gallery/Upper-Level-Standing-Decks/7c433da1-6b95-4b73-9ddf-2d2bf2314ce0#adc6dce0-d4a7-4558-8195-b1f87c7d325a&lt;/ref&gt; These terraced, standing room only sections are similar to [[safe standing]] sections in European stadiums, though they are not marketed as such.

'''Zdeněk Koubek''' (born '''Zdena "Zdeňka" Koubková''', 8 December 1913 – 12 June 1986) was a track athlete from [[Czechoslovakia]]. He won two medals at the [[1934 Women's World Games]] and several national titles in the 100–800 m running, long jump and high jump, and set a few world records in running events. In 1936, he underwent female to male gender reassignment surgery and retired from athletics.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

==Biography==
Koubek was born in Paskov, in a family of eight siblings. Soon after his birth, the family moved to [[Brno]], where he finished school and started training in athletics. Koubková continued his education and training in Prague.

In 1934 he won five national titles, in the 100 m, 200 m and 800 m running, high jump and long jump. On 14 June 1934 he set his first world record, in the 800 m at 2:16.4. His next world record came in the medley relay (2×100 m, 200 m and 800 m), at 3:14.4. Later in August, Koubek won the 800 m event at the [[1934 Women's World Games]], in a world record time of 2:12.4, and finished third in the long jump with a national record of 5.70 m. Around that time newspapers started discussing his excessive (for a woman) masculinity, noting that pants would suit him better than a skirt.&lt;ref name="r4" /&gt;

In 1935 Koubek retired from competitions and for six months toured the United States. The next year, he underwent gender reassignment surgery and changed his name.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; He abandoned athletics and a potential coaching career, and only after World War II did he join the team of his brother Jaroslav and played rugby for a local club.&lt;ref name=r4/&gt;

Koubek spent his late years living with a wife in Prague, where he died aged 73. A 1935 novel ''Zdenin světový rekord'' (''Zdena's world record'') by Lída Merlínová is based on his early life and career.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;&lt;ref name=r4/&gt;
