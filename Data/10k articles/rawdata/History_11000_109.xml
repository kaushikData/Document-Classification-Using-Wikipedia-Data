[[File:Abraham Hülphers.jpg|thumb|Abraham Hülphers by J. Streng]]
'''Abraham Abrahamsson Hülphers''' ( 27 November 1734, [[Västerås]] – 24 February 1798, Västerås) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] writer, [[musicologist]], [[topographer]], and [[genealogist]]. He is particularly known for his book ''Historisk Afhandling om Musik och Instrumenter'' (published in 1773) which chronicles the musical scene in Sweden during the [[Age of Liberty]], and also provides an extensive [[music history]] of organ music in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;http://runeberg.org/stf/1898/0329.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham [[Hülphers]] was the third oldest of 13 children of the [[Medieval bourgeoisie|burgher]] [[Abraham Danielsson Hülphers]] from [[Hedemora]], [[Dalarna]], and his wife Christina Westdahl from [[Västerås]]. The Hülphers family immigrated to Sweden from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the [[early modern era]]. Through schooling in home, he was given a dynamic education and upbringing, with early interest sparked for [[science]].

He was a member of [[Utile Dulci]], [[Royal Patriotic Society]], the [[National Board of Trade (Sweden)|National Board of Trade]], and [[:sv:Pro Fide et Christianismo|Pro Fide et Christianismo]], among others.

==Biography==
He was born in 1922 in Kessab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorspectator.com/2011/04/21/dr-antranig-chalabian-author-of-historical-volumes-dies/ |title=Dr. Antranig Chalabian, Author Of Historical Volumes, Dies |publisher=Mirrorspectator.com |date=2011-04-21 |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from the Armenian Evangelical School, he studied at Aleppo College. Then, in the summer of 1949, Chalabian moved to Beirut and took a position in the physiology department of the [[American University of Beirut]] (AUB). In 1977, Chalabian and his family immigrated to the [[Detroit, USA]], where Chalabian worked as public relations director at the AGBU Alex Manoogian School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abrilbooks.com/artists/789.html Antranig Chalabian] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120034020/http://www.abrilbooks.com/artists/789.html |date=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 he published his first historical book ''General Andranik and the Armenian Revolutionary Movement''. In 1989 at the History Department of the [[Yerevan State University]] he was awarded a doctorate in history. The book was later translated into English, Turkish, Greek and Spanish. The book became an instant best seller (75,000 copies sold only in Armenia). Academician Mkrtich G. Nersisyan called the book a "valuable historical work resulted by many years of persistent research".&lt;ref&gt;M. Nersisyan, ''Patmutyan Keghdzararnere'' (articles), Yerevan, "Gitutyun", 1998, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Chalabian is also the author of ''Revolutionary Figures'' (1991),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groong.usc.edu/tcc/tcc-20040202.html |title=Revolutionary Figures |publisher=Groong.usc.edu |date=2004-02-02 |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Armenia After Coming of Islam'' and ''Dro'' books.

Chalabian received numerous accolades and recognition. The mayor of Southfield designated in 2005 a day as Dr. Antranig Chalabian Day in recognition of his goodwill ambassadorship of the city through his readers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keghart.com/Apelian_Chalabian |title=Antranig, The First Born, Is No More, by Dr. Vahe H. Apelian, 14 April 2011 |publisher=Keghart.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an invited contributor to ''Military History'' Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorspectator.com/2011/04/21/dr-antranig-chalabian-author-of-historical-volumes-dies/ |title=Dr. Antranig Chalabian, Author Of Historical Volumes, Dies // "The Armenian Mirror-Spectator", Apr 21, 2011 |publisher=Mirrorspectator.com |date=2011-04-21 |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regularly contributed articles to the Armenian publications like ''[[Spurk]]'', ''[[Nayiri (periodical)|Nayiri]]'', ''Chanasser'', ''[[Armenian Mirror-Spectator]]'' and ''[[Andranikological Review]]'' papers.

Before writing and publishing his books, Dr. Antranig Chalabian collaborated with Dr. [[Stanley Kerr]] after discovering Dr. Kerr’s personal notes in the attic of the Physiology Department. Dr. Stanley Kerr had moved to New Jersey after retiring in 1965 from his distinguished career as the Chairman of the Biochemistry Department of the American University of Beirut. However, he had left his notes behind assuming that the notes were long lost through the years. Stanley Kerr had kept his notes and taken hitherto unpublished pictures while serving in [[Near East Relief]]. In 1919 Stanley was transferred to Marash, in central Anatolia, where he headed the American relief operations. The outcome of their collaborative work was the publication of Dr. Stanley Kerr’s ''[[The Lions of Marash]]'' in 1973.
 
While collaborating with Dr. Kerr, [[Henry Wilfrid Glockler]], a one-time controller at AUB and a neighbor of the Kerrs in Princenton, entrusted Antranig Chalabian his personal memoirs. Chalabian edited the memoirs and had it published in Beirut in 1969 by ''Sevan'' publishing house. The book is titled ''Interned in Turkey''.

'''Bartholomew of Lucca''', born '''Bartolomeo Fiadóni''', and also known as '''Tolomeo da Lucca''' or '''Ptolemy da Lucca'''&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy or Tolomeo da Lucca, Tolomeo di Lucca, Bartolomeus de Fiadonibus.&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 1236 &amp;ndash; c. 1327), was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Italy|Italian]] historian. 

==Biography==
Born in [[Lucca]], probably in 1236, at an early age Bartholomew entered the [[Dominican Order]]. He was distinguished for piety, and his intense application to study, for which reasons he won the respect and warm friendship of [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]. He was not only his disciple, but also his confidant and [[confessor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ptolom., H. E., XXIII, viii''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1272 he accompanied St. Thomas from [[Rome]] to [[Naples]] where he still was in 1274, when the news of his master's death at [[Fossa Nuova]] reached him. He was elected prior of the convent of his native city in 1288. At Naples (1294), he took an active part in the public demonstration which was made to prevent [[Pope Celestine V]] from resigning.

In 1301 he was elected Prior of [[Santa Maria Novella]] at [[Florence]]. Later he removed to [[Avignon]] where he was chaplain for nine years (1309–18) to [[Cardinal Patrasso]], [[Bishop of Albano]], and after the Cardinal's death in 1311 to his fellow-religious [[Cardinal William of Bayonne]]. [[Jacques Échard]] affirms that he was the close friend and often the confessor of [[John XXII]], who appointed him Bishop of [[Torcello]], March 15, 1318. A conflict with the [[Patriarch of Grado]] concerning the appointment of an abbess of St. Anthony's at Torcello led to his [[excommunication]] in 1321, and exile. In 1323 he made peace with the patriarch, returned to his see, and died there in 1327.&lt;ref&gt;On the life of Bartholomew, see Ludwig Schmugge, "[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/bartolomeo-fiadoni_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ FIADONI, Bartolomeo] (Tolomeo, Ptolomeo da Lucca)", in ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani'', 47 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
The best-known work of Bartholomew is his ''Annales'' (1061–1303), finished about 1307, wherein are recorded in terse sentences the chief events of this period.&lt;ref&gt;Muratori, ''Rerum Italicarum Scriptores,'' XI, 1249 sqq.; or in the better edition of C. Minutoli, ''Documenti di Storia Italiana,'' Florence, 1876, VI, 35 sqq..&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Historia Ecclesiastica Nova'' in twenty-four books relates the history of the Church from the birth of [[Christ]] till 1294; considering as appendixes the lives of [[Pope Boniface VIII]], [[Pope Benedict XI]], and [[Pope Clement V]], it reaches to 1314 (Muratori, loc. cit., XI, 751 sqq.; the life of Clement V is in Baluze, ''Vitae pap. Aven.,'' 23 sqq.).

He also wrote a ''Historia Tripartita'' known only from his own references and citations. The ''Extract[us] de chronico Fr. Ptolomaei de Luca'' and the ''Excerpta ex chronicis Fr. Ptolomaei'' are no longer considered original works by separate authors, but are extracts from the ''Historia Ecclesiastica Nova'' by some unknown compiler who lived after the death of Bartholomew. He is also well known for his completion of the ''De Regimine Principum'' ("On the Government of Rulers"), which Aquinas had been unable to finish before his death. This was no small task, for the share of Bartholomew begins with the sixth chapter of the second book and includes the third and fourth books (vol. XVI, in the Parma, 1865, edition of St. Thomas). Though he does not follow the order of the saint, yet his treatment is clear and logical.

A work on the ''[[Hexameron|Hexaemeron]]'' by him was published by Masetti in 1880. The lives of the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon popes]] were written from original documents under his hands and were controlled by the statements of eyewitnesses. His acceptance of [[fables]] now exploded, e.g. the [[Pope Joan|Popess Joan]], must be attributed to the uncritical temper of his time.

'''Bernard Desclot''' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: Bernat Desclot) was a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[chronicle]]r whose work covering the brief reign of [[Peter III of Aragon]] (1276–85) forms one of the four ''Catalan Grand Chronicles''  through which the modern historian views thirteenth- and fourteenth century military and political matters in the  [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and the [[Principality of Catalonia]],&lt;ref&gt;The other three sources are the autobiographies of [[James I of Aragon]] and [[Ramon Muntaner]] and the royal chronicle of [[Peter IV of Aragon]].&lt;/ref&gt; including the "[[Aragonese Crusade]]". Desclot's ''Chronicle'' begins in the eleventh century but gains especial interest when he comes to describe events current within living memory. Bernard's literary model was [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance]], and his account is spiced with dramatic monologues of the central characters and thrilling episodes, such as the escape of Peter's brother, [[James II of Majorca]], from the fortress of [[Perpignan]], through the castle's drains.

Nothing of Bernard himself is known save what little can be gleaned through his ''Chronicle''.

F.L. Critchlow provided an English translation of the section covering the reign of Peter III in ''Chronicle of the Reign of King Peter III of Aragon, 1276-85'' (Princeton University Press) 1928.

'''William Douglas "Bill" Gairdner'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Sports-Reference|accessdate=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born October 19, 1940 in [[Oakville, Ontario]]) is a retired [[track and field]] [[Athletics (sport)|athlete]] who represented [[Canada]] in the men's [[400 m hurdles]] and the men's [[decathlon]] at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]]. He was awarded a silver medal in [[decathlon]] event at the [[1963 Pan American Games]] in [[Brazil]].

Gairdner attended [[Appleby College]] in Oakville, and is now a resident of [[Toronto]]. Following his hurdling career, he applied himself to the field of academia. He gained his first [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1967 (studying [[Structural Linguistics]] at [[Stanford University]]) and then earned a second one at the institution in 1969 in [[English Literature]] and [[Creative Writing]]. A year later he graduated with a Ph.D. in [[English Literature]] from Stanford. He is a published author and, among his works, [[BPS Books]] have published ''[[The Trouble with Canada]]'', ''The Trouble with Democracy'' and ''[[Oh, Oh, Canada!]]''.

==Viewpoints==
In an interview in the ''[[Michael Coren Show]]'', Gairdner asserted that all modern Western democracies are "out of control" due to deficit spending and debts. He said that Canada is nearing a [[precipice]] with [[Health care in Canada|Canada's health care system]], what he considers to be a "mistake", taking up more and more of the nation's government budget. He also said that he thinks anything produced by government, which he sees motivated by "power and size", will end up costing twice as much as anything made by the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctstv.com/michaelcoren/?vidID=20663|publisher=''[[Michael Coren Show]]''|title=Author Bill Gairdner|date=November 30, 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725001728/http://www.ctstv.com/michaelcoren/?vidID=20663|archivedate=July 25, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Robert Starkey'''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Starkey had his middle name in 1986 when he stood for election but it was not mentioned when he was awarded his CBE in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]] [[Royal Historical Society|FRHistS]] (born 3 January 1945) is an English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chris|first1=Hastings|title=England is the country that 'dare not speak its name'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1474347/England-is-the-country-that-dare-not-speak-its-name.html|website=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=5 September 2017|language=en|date=17 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[constitutional]] [[historian]] and a radio and television presenter.

Born the only child of [[Quaker]] parents, he attended [[Kirkbie Kendal School|Kendal Grammar School]] before studying at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] through a [[scholarship]]. There he specialised in [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor history]], writing a thesis on [[King Henry VIII]]'s household. From Cambridge, he moved to the [[London School of Economics]] where he was a lecturer in history until 1998. He has written several books on the Tudors.

Starkey is a well-known radio and television personality, first appearing on television in 1977. While a regular contributor to the [[BBC Radio 4]] debate programme ''[[The Moral Maze]]'', his acerbic tongue earned him the sobriquet of "rudest man in Britain";&lt;ref name="Sunday Herald"/&gt; his frequent appearances on ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' have been received with criticism and applause. Starkey has presented several history documentaries. In 2002, he signed a £2&amp;nbsp;million contract with [[Channel 4]] for 25&amp;nbsp;hours of programming, and in 2011 was a contributor on the Channel 4 series ''[[Jamie's Dream School]]''.

==Early years and education==
David Starkey was born on 3 January 1945 in [[Kendal]], [[Westmorland]].&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;{{Citation | title = Profile: David Starkey | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article4837679.ece | publisher = entertainment.timesonline.co.uk | date = 28 September 2008 | accessdate = 18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the only child of Robert Starkey and Elsie Lyon, [[Quakers]] who had married 10 years previously in [[Bolton]], at a [[Friends meeting house]]. His father, the son of a cotton spinner, was a foreman in a washing-machine factory, while his mother followed in her father's footsteps and became a cotton weaver and later a cleaner.&lt;ref name="History Man"/&gt;&lt;ref name=detective&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2007/01/27/hfamhist27.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331042010/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fhealth%2F2007%2F01%2F27%2Fhfamhist27.xml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 March 2007 |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |title=Family detective |first=Nick |last=Barratt |date=27 January 2007 |accessdate=14 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starkey is equivocal about his mother, describing her as both "wonderful", in that she helped develop his ambition, and "monstrous", intellectually frustrated and living through her son.&lt;ref name="History Man"/&gt; "She was a wonderful but also very frightening parent. Finally, she was a Pygmalion.  She wanted a creature, she wanted something she had made."&lt;ref name="Sunday Herald"/&gt;  Her dominance contrasted sharply to his father, who was "poetic, reflective, rather solitary...as a father he was weak."&lt;ref name="Sunday Herald"/&gt; Their relationship was "distant", but improved after his mother's death in 1977.&lt;ref name="Sunday Herald"/&gt;

Starkey was born with two [[club feet]]. One was fixed early, while the other had to be operated on several times.&lt;ref name="Did I really say that"/&gt; He also suffered from [[polio]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph2009"/&gt; He suffered a nervous breakdown at secondary school, aged&amp;nbsp;13, and was taken by his mother to a boarding house in [[Southport]], where he spent several months&lt;!-- some sources say four, others six --&gt; recovering.&lt;ref name="Telegraph2009"&gt;{{Citation | last = Kinmount | first = Will | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/5065410/Is-David-Starkey-the-reincarnation-of-Henry-VIII.html | title = Is David Starkey the reincarnation of Henry VIII? | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 28 March 2009 | accessdate = 14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starkey blamed the episode on the unfamiliar experience of being in a "highly competitive environment".&lt;ref name="Did I really say that"/&gt; He ultimately excelled at [[Kirkbie Kendal School|Kendal Grammar School]], winning debating prizes and appearing in school plays.&lt;ref name="Laughing"&gt;{{Citation | last = Frost | first = Caroline | title = David Starkey: Laughing all the way to the library | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1860744.stm | publisher = news.bbc.co.uk | date = 8 March 2002 | accessdate = 14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A man with a past"/&gt;

Although he showed an early inclination toward science, he chose instead to study history.&lt;ref name="in conversation with"&gt;{{Citation|last=Dale |first=Iain |title=In conversation with... David Starkey |url=http://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/2893/in-conversation-with-david-starkey.thtml |publisher=totalpolitics.com |date=18 September 2009 |accessdate=18 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004152510/http://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/2893/in-conversation-with-david-starkey.thtml |archivedate=4 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A scholarship enabled his entry into [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref name="Exclusive interview"/&gt; where he gained a first class degree.&lt;ref name="History Man"/&gt;

Starkey was fascinated by [[King Henry VIII]], and his thesis focused on the Tudor monarch's inner household. His doctoral supervisor was Sir [[Geoffrey Elton]], an expert on the Tudor period. Starkey claimed that with age his mentor became "tetchy" and "arrogant". In 1983, when Elton was awarded a knighthood, Starkey derided one of his essays, ''Cromwell Redivivus'' and Elton responded by writing an "absolutely shocking" review of a collection of essays Starkey had edited. Starkey later expressed his remorse over the spat: "I regret that the thing happened at all."&lt;ref name="Exclusive interview"&gt;{{Citation | last = Whittell | first = Giles | title = Exclusive interview with David Starkey | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article4915329.ece | publisher = entertainment.timesonline.co.uk | date = 9 October 2008 | accessdate = 14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bored at Cambridge&lt;ref name="Did I really say that"/&gt; and attracted to London's gay scene, in 1972 Starkey moved to the [[London School of Economics]] and secured a position as a part-time, junior associate lecturer.&lt;ref name="History Man"/&gt; He claimed to be an "excessively enthusiastic advocate of promiscuity",&lt;ref name="A man with a past"&gt;{{Citation |last=Preston |first=John |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669985/David-Starkey-A-man-with-a-past.html |title=David Starkey: A man with a past |publisher=telegraph.co.uk|date= 16 December 2007 |accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeking to liberate himself from his mother, who strongly disapproved of his homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Sunday Herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A man with a past"/&gt; A 30-year career as a teacher ended in 1998 when, blaming boredom and modern academic life, he gave it up.&lt;ref name="Did I really say that"&gt;{{Citation | last = Barber | first = Lynn | title = 'I'd wake up and think: God, did I really say that?' | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/10/history.academicexperts | publisher = guardian.co.uk | date = 10 October 2004 | accessdate = 15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starkey entered a wider public awareness in 1992 on the [[BBC Radio 4]] debate programme ''[[The Moral Maze]]'',&lt;ref name="Laughing"/&gt; where he debated morality with his fellow panellists [[Rabbi]] [[Hugo Gryn]], [[Roger Scruton]] and the journalist [[Janet Daley]]. He soon acquired a reputation for abrasiveness; he explained in 2007 that his personality possesses "a tendency towards showmanship... towards self-indulgence and explosion and repartee and occasional silliness and going over the top."&lt;ref name="A man with a past"/&gt; The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' gave him the sobriquet of "the rudest man in Britain", although Starkey claims that his character was part of a "convenient image".&lt;ref name="Sunday Herald"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-9994525.html |title=Rude; Wealth; David Starkey is famous for being rich, gay and, well, | publisher = The Sunday Herald | date = 23 March 2003 | p=7 | first=Peter | last=Ross |subscription=yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He once attacked George Austin, the [[Archdeacon of York]], over "his fatness, his smugness, and his pomposity",&lt;ref name="Did I really say that"/&gt; but after a nine-year stint on the programme he left, citing his boredom with being "Dr Rude" and its move to an evening slot.&lt;ref name="History Man"&gt;{{Citation| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101213004122/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/david-starkey-the-history-man-427499.html | archivedate = 13 December 2010|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/david-starkey-the-history-man-427499.html | publisher = independent.co.uk| title=David Starkey: The history man | date=9 December 2006 | accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Did I really say that"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A man with a past"/&gt;

From 1995 he also spent three years at [[Talk Radio UK]], presenting ''Starkey on Saturday'', later ''Starkey on Sunday''.  An interview with [[Denis Healey]] proved to be one of his most embarrassing moments: "I mistakenly thought that he had become an amiable old buffer who would engage in amusing conversation, and he tore me limb from limb. I laugh about it now, but I didn't feel like laughing about it at the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Morris | first = Sophie | title = David Starkey: My life in media | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/david-starkey-my-life-in-media-765548.html | publisher = independent.co.uk | date = 17 December 2007 | accessdate = 15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Family of Henry VIII c 1545.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Starkey is well known for his historical analyses of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and his Court]]

His first television appearance was in 1977, on [[Granada Television]]'s ''Behave Yourself'' with [[Russell Harty]].&lt;ref name="Did I really say that"/&gt; He was a prosecution witness in the 1984 ITV programme ''The Trial of Richard III'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Trial of Richard III | publisher = ITV | date = 4 November 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose jury acquitted the king on the grounds of insufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Richard III On Screen | url = http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1022653/ | publisher = screenonline.org.uk | accessdate = 16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His television documentaries on ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (documentary)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'' and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] were ratings successes.&lt;ref name="Laughing"/&gt; His breathless delivery of the script, with noticeable breaths and choppy cadence, is widely imitated. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Peculiar Television Personalities | publisher = Grotto Press | date = 12 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 he signed a £2&amp;nbsp;million contract with [[Channel 4]] to produce 25&amp;nbsp;hours of television, including ''[[Monarchy TV series|Monarchy]]'', a chronicle of the history of English kings and queens from Anglo-Saxon times onward.&lt;ref name="Did I really say that"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughing"/&gt;  He presented the 2009 series ''Henry: Mind of a Tyrant'', which [[Brian Viner]], a reviewer for the ''Independent'', called "highly fascinating",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Viner | first = Brian | title = Last Night's Television - Winds,BBC4; Henry VIII: Mind of a Tyrant, Channel 4 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/last-nights-television--windsbbc4-henry-viii-mind-of-a-tyrant-channel-4-1675074.html | publisher = independent.co.uk | date = 28 April 2009 | accessdate = 16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[A. A. Gill]] was less complimentary, calling it "Hello! history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gill | first = AA | authorlink = AA Gill | title = Henry VIII — Mind of a Tyrant was a Hello! history | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6155789.ece | publisher = entertainment.timesonline.co.uk | date = 26 April 2009 | accessdate = 16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview about the series for the ''[[Radio Times]]'', Starkey complained that too many historians had focused not on Henry, but on his wives.  Referring to a "feminised history", he said: "so many of the writers who write about this are women and so much of their audience is a female audience."&lt;ref name="Radio Times"&gt;{{Citation | last = Adams | first = Stephen | title = History has been 'feminised' says David Starkey as he launches Henry VIII series | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/5077505/History-has-been-feminised-says-David-Starkey-as-he-launches-Henry-VIII-series.html | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 30 March 2009 | accessdate = 17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This prompted the historian [[Lucy Worsley]] to label his comments as misogynistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Allen | first = Vanessa | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1166125/Women-turn-history-bizarre-soap-opera-says-Starkey.html | title = Women turn history into a bizarre soap opera, says Starkey | publisher = dailymail.co.uk | date = 31 March 2009 | accessdate = 17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, in 2011, he taught five history lessons in Channel 4's ''Jamie's Dream School'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Jamie's Dream School | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1AH_lKDQF8 | publisher = Channel 4, hosted at youtube.com | date = 2 March 2011 | accessdate = 16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamie"&gt;{{citation |last1=Harvey |first1=Chris |last2=Radford |first2=Ceri |title=Jamie's Dream School: are you sick of Jamie Oliver's celebrity lectures? |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date=2 March 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8355488/Jamies-Dream-School-are-you-sick-of-Jamie-Olivers-celebrity-lectures.html |accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he criticised the state education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Starkey | first = David | title = David Starkey: Jamie's Dream School was a lesson I'll never forget | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/8333863/David-Starkey-Jamies-Dream-School-was-a-lesson-Ill-never-forget.html | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 19 February 2011 | accessdate = 18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | text = The core of history is narrative and biography. And the way history has been presented in the curriculum for the last 25 years is very different. The importance of knowledge has been downgraded. Instead the argument has been that it's all about skills. Supposedly, what you are trying to do with children is inculcate them with the analytical skills of the historian. Now this seems to me to be the most goddamn awful way to approach any subject, and also the most dangerous, and one, of course, that panders to all sorts of easy assumptions - ‘oh we've got the internet, we don't need knowledge anymore because it's so easy to look things up'. Oh no it isn't. In order to think, you actually need the information in your mind.| sign=David Starkey&lt;ref name="in conversation with"/&gt;}}

In 1984 Starkey was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Historical Society]] and in 1994 a [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.sal.org.uk/history/listoffellows/?letter=S |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104230144/http://www.sal.org.uk/history/listoffellows/?letter=S |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 November 2007 |title=Society of Antiquaries of London - List of Fellows |publisher=sal.org.uk |accessdate=16 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also given an Honorary Fellowship at his Cambridge College, [[Fitzwilliam College]]. He has worked as curator on several exhibitions,&lt;!-- cursory search reveals several instances, but it probably isn't that controversial a statement to require lots of citations – for instance, he was Guest Curator for an exhibit on Henvry VIII held in 2009 at the [[British Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.york.ac.uk/ipup/projects/york/bigcityread/blexhib.html |title= Henry VIII: Man and Monarch |publisher=york.ac.uk | year = 2009 |accessdate= 16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; including an exhibit in 2003 on [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], following which he had lunch with her namesake, [[Elizabeth II]].  Several years later he told a reporter that the monarch had no interest in her predecessors, other than those who followed her [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|great grandfather]].  "I don't think she's at all comfortable with anybody – I would hesitate to use the word intellectual – but it's useful.

On 25 June 2012 Starkey gave his lecture 'Head of Our Morality: why the twentieth-century British monarchy matters' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.archaeologyuk.org/celebrating-the-rededication-of-the-vch-to-hm-queen-elizabeth-ii|title=Celebrating the rededication of the VCH to HM Queen Elizabeth II - Council for British Archaeology|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[The Marc Fitch Lectures]].

==Politics==

Starkey was raised in an austere and frugal environment of near-poverty, with his parents often unemployed for long periods of time; an environment which, he later stated, taught him "the value of money".&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{Citation | last = Patterson | first = Christina | title = King of the castle: David Starkey returns to his pet subject, Henry VIII | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/king-of-the-castle-david-starkey-returns-to-his-pet-subject-henry-viii-1660597.html | publisher = independent.co.uk | date = 3 April 2009 | accessdate = 16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I suppose my politics remained essentially in the middle-of-the-road Labour left until the end of the 1970s".&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; Starkey blames the [[James Callaghan|Callaghan]] administration for "blow[ing] the nation's finances".&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; During the 1980s he was an active [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] member, and he was a Conservative candidate for [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] Borough Council in 1986 in Tollington ward,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://data.london.gov.uk/documents/LBCE_1986-5-8.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515200352/http://data.london.gov.uk/documents/LBCE_1986-5-8.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 May 2012 |title=London Borough Council Elections, 8 May 1986 |publisher=Research and Intelligence Unit, [[London Residuary Body]] |year=1986 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1990 in Hillrise ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://data.london.gov.uk/documents/LBCE_1990-5-3.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515200534/http://data.london.gov.uk/documents/LBCE_1990-5-3.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 May 2012 |title=London Borough Council Elections, 3rd May 1990 |publisher=London Research Centre |year=1990 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He bemoaned the Conservatives when they were in Opposition, criticising [[Michael Howard]] in particular: "I knew Michael Howard was going to be a disaster as soon as he opposed top-up fees, either out of sentimentality or calculated expediency so that it might get him a bit of the student vote...Instead of backing Tony Blair, causing revolution in the Labour Party, the Conservatives have been whoring after strange gods, coming up with increasingly strange policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Thompson | first = Damien | title = England has a terrible crisis of identity | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3646412/England-has-a-terrible-crisis-of-identity.html | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | date = 9 September 2005 | accessdate = 16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He likened [[Gordon Brown]] to the fictional [[Kenneth Widmerpool]], continuing, "It seems to me that with Brown there is a complete sense of humour and charm bypass."&lt;ref name="in conversation with"/&gt;  Of [[Ed Miliband]], in 2015 he said "He is a man of high ambition and low talent – the worst possible combination.

During the 2011 Conservative Party Conference, he spoke at a fringe meeting, declaring [[Mayor of London|Mayor]] [[Boris Johnson]] to be a "jester-despot", and Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], as having "absolutely no strategy" for running the country. He urged the party to re-engage with the working class rather than the "''Guardian''-reading middle class".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Parkinson | first = Justin | title = Tory conference: Starkey lets Cameron have it | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15158057 | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 4 October 2011 | accessdate = 11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015 he claimed that while Cameron and his [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], [[George Osborne]], had introduced some meaningful reforms to education and welfare policies, they had not made large enough cuts to the UK's budget deficit.&lt;ref name="Telegraphmiliband"/&gt;

Starkey prefers radical changes to the UK's constitution in line with the federal system used by the United States, although in an interview with [[Iain Dale]] he expressed his support for the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]], the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] and [[Prince Charles]].&lt;ref name="in conversation with"/&gt;  In the run-up to the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|UK Alternative Vote referendum]], he was a signatory on a letter to ''The Times'', which urged people to vote against the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.conservatives.com/News/News_stories/2011/03/Historians_against_AV.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314050733/http://www.conservatives.com/News/News_stories/2011/03/Historians_against_AV.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 March 2011 |title=Historians against AV |publisher=conservatives.com |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starkey is an honorary associate of the [[National Secular Society]] and an ardent supporter of [[LGBT civil rights movement|gay equality movements]].

In August 2014, Starkey was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on that issue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views on multiculturalism ==

In August 2011, Starkey appeared as a guest on the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme together with [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] and [[Dreda Say Mitchell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England riots: 'The whites have become black' says David Starkey|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14513517|accessdate=13 January 2016|work=BBC News|date=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; made during a discussion about the [[2011 England riots]]. Starkey claimed that "the whites have become black", and that "a particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic, gangster culture has become the fashion".&lt;ref name="Riots"&gt;{{Citation | title = Ed Miliband condemns David Starkey's race comment | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14531077 | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date = 15 August 2011 | accessdate = 17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the Labour party, [[Ed Miliband]], spoke about Starkey's remarks, saying "they are racist comments, frankly".&lt;ref name="Riots"/&gt; The author [[Toby Young]], [[blogging]] in the ''Telegraph'', defended Starkey by claiming that Starkey had been talking not about black culture in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Young | first = Toby | title = Was David Starkey being racist on Newsnight last night? | url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100100845/was-david-starkey-being-racist-on-newsnight-last-night/ | publisher = blogs.telegraph.co.uk | date = 13 August 2011 | accessdate = 17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rod Liddle]] argued in support of the remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Liddle |first=Rod |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/rodliddle/7168573/is-david-starkey-a-racist.thtml |title=Is David Starkey a Racist? |publisher=The Spectator |accessdate=17 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006170125/http://www.spectator.co.uk/rodliddle/7168573/is-david-starkey-a-racist.thtml |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow panellist Owen Jones described the comments as "one of the ugliest episodes of the backlash",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Owen|title=Owen Jones: Why 'chavs' were the riots’ scapegoats|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/owen-jones-why-chavs-were-the-riots-scapegoats-7697824.html|accessdate=12 January 2016|work=The Independent|date=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that "multiculturalism and ethnic groups have nothing to do with what happened".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Riots played right into British govt’s hands|url=https://www.rt.com/news/owen-jones-uk-unrest-975-70839-839/|accessdate=12 January 2016|work=RT International|date=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''The Daily Telegraph'', Starkey argued his views had been distorted, he referred only to a "particular sort" of 'Black' culture, and that the "black educationalists" Tony Sewell and [[Katharine Birbalsingh]] supported the substance of his ''Newsnight'' comments.{{#tag:ref|For Tony Sewell's comments, see {{Citation | last = Sewell | first = Tony | title = Don't howl Starkey down.

In a June 2012 debate, Starkey stated that a [[Rochdale sex trafficking gang]] had values "entrenched in the foothills of the Punjab or wherever it is", and was accused by his fellow panelist, writer [[Laurie Penny]], of "playing xenophobia and national prejudice for laughs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grimston|first1=Jack|last2=Loveys|first2=Kate|title=Starkey erupts in racism rumpus|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/starkey-erupts-in-racism-rumpus-s7r230bqzrb|accessdate=24 June 2012|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|subscription=y|date=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Douglass Cecil North''' (November 5, 1920 – November 23, 2015) was an American [[economist]] known for his work in [[economic history]]. He was the co-recipient (with [[Robert William Fogel]]) of the 1993 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]].  In the words of the [[Nobel Committee]], North and Fogel "renewed research in economic history by applying economic theory and quantitative methods in order to explain economic and institutional change."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1993/north-bio.html|title = Douglass C.

==Biography==
Douglass North was born in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], on November 5, 1920. He moved several times as a child due to his father's work at [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company|MetLife]]. The family lived in [[Ottawa]], [[Lausanne]], [[New York City]], and [[Wallingford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

North was educated at [[Ashbury College]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]] and the [[Choate Rosemary Hall|Choate School]] in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]]. He was accepted at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] at the same time that his father became the head of MetLife on the west coast, so North opted to go to [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In 1942, he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in General Curriculum-[[Humanities]]. Although his grades amounted to slightly better than a [[Academic grading in North America|"C" average]], he managed to complete a triple major in [[political science]], [[philosophy]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A [[conscientious objector]] in [[World War II]], North became a [[navigator]] in the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]], traveling between [[San Francisco]] and [[Australia]]. During that time, he read economics and picked up his [[hobby]] of [[photography]]. He taught navigation at the Maritime Service Officers' School in [[Alameda, California|Alameda]] during the last year of the war, and struggled with the decision of whether to become a [[photographer]] or an economist.&lt;ref&gt;Breit, William and Barry T. Hirsch. Lives of the Laureates, 4th ed. Cambridge, Mass: The MIT Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

North returned to UC Berkeley to pursue a [[PhD]] in [[economics]]. He finished his studies in 1952 as he began work as an [[assistant professor]] at the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

North died on November 23, 2015, at his summer home in [[Benzonia, Michigan]] from [[esophageal cancer]] at the age of 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Everding|first1=Gerry|title=Obituary: Douglass C.

==Academic career==
From 1951–56, North was an assistant professor of economics at the University of Washington, then from 1956–1960, an associate professor.  In 1960 North became co-editor of the ''[[Journal of Economic History]]'', popularizing [[Cliometrics]] (New Economic History), and from 1960–1983 he was [[Professor]] of Economics at the [[University of Washington]] where he also served as the chair of the economics department from 1967–79.  In 1979 he served as the Peterkin Professor of Political Economy at [[Rice University]], and in 1981–82 as the [[Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions]] at [[Cambridge University]], before joining the faculty of [[Washington University in Saint Louis]] in 1983 as the [[Henry R. Luce]] Professor of Law and Liberty in the Department of [[Economics]] (where he also served as director of the Center for [[Political Economy]] from 1984 to 1990).  He was the Bartlett Burnap Senior Fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoover.org/bios/north.html North's Profile], ''Hoover Institution'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828113254/http://www.hoover.org/bios/north.html|date=August 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, he became the first [[economic historian]] to win the [[John R. Commons]] Award,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omicrondeltaepsilon.org/handbook.html#commons John R. Commons Award], '', Omicron Delta Epsilon''&lt;/ref&gt; which was established by the [[Omicron Delta Epsilon|International Honors Society for Economics]] in 1965.

A collection of North's papers is housed at the Rubenstein Library at Duke University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/northdouglass |title=Douglass Cecil North Papers, 1942–2006 and undated |publisher=Rubenstein Library, Duke University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research agenda==
Along with [[Ronald Coase]] and [[Oliver Williamson]], he helped found the International Society for the [[New Institutional Economics]] (ISNIE)&lt;ref&gt;Claude Ménard, Shirley Mary M. (2011): [https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00624297/document#page=20 The Contribution of Douglass North to New Institutional Economics]. PDF, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; which held its first meeting in St. Louis in 1997. His research included [[property rights]], [[transaction cost]]s, the [[institution]]al basis of markets, and economic organization in history as well as economic development in [[developing countries]].

North served as an expert for the [[Copenhagen Consensus]] and as an advisor to governments around the world.  He was engaged in research (with John J. Wallis of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] and Barry Weingast of [[Stanford University]]) on how countries emerge from what they call "the natural state" and into long-run economic growth.  He was a trustee of the [[Economists for Peace and Security]] and a special adviser to the non-profit organization [[Vipani]].

=== ''Institutions'' ===
Douglass North's 1991 paper summarizes much of his earlier research relating to economic and institutional change. In this paper, North defines institutions as "humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic and social interactions".&lt;ref name="institutions"&gt;North, Douglass (1991): [https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.5.1.97 Institutions]&lt;/ref&gt; Constraints, as North describes, are devised as formal rules (constitutions, laws, property rights) and informal restraints (sanctions, taboos, customs, traditions, codes of conduct), which usually contribute to the perpetuation of order and safety within a market or society. The degree to which they are effective is subject to varying circumstances, such as a government's limited coercive force, a lack of organized state, or the presence of strong religious precept.

Section 2 of North's 1991 paper describes the economic development of societies as occurring in stages:

North begins with local exchange within the village. In this setting, specialization "is rudimentary and self-sufficiency characterizes most individual households", with small-scale village trade existing within dense social networks of informal constraints that facilitate local exchange, and a relatively low transaction cost.  In this close-knit network "people have an intimate understanding of each other, and the threat of violence is a continuous force for preserving order ..."&lt;ref name="institutions" /&gt;

With growth, the market extends beyond the village into larger, interconnected regions. As the participants of a transaction become more socially distant, the terms of exchange must be made more explicit. This increase in transaction costs necessitates institutions that reduce the risks of being cheated, either by raising "the benefits of cooperative solutions or the costs of defection".&lt;ref name="institutions" /&gt;

As long-distance trade becomes more feasible, generally through caravans or lengthy ship voyages, individuals and groups experience occupational and geographic specialization. Society also experiences a rise of formal trading centers (temporary gathering places, towns or cities). From the development of long-distance trade arise two transactional cost problems.

The first transactional cost problem is agency: the transfer of one's goods or services outside the control of local rule leaves the rules of exchange undefined, the risk of unfair trade high, and the contracts within society unenforced. For this reason, sedentary merchants often would send their kin with the product to ensure its safe arrival and the fulfillment of agreed terms of exchange by the receiving party.

The second transactional cost problem is the enforcement of contracts. Historically this problem was met with either armed forces protecting ships or caravans, or use of tolls by local coercive groups. However, in modern societies, institutions acting cooperatively in the interest of free market trade provide protection for goods and enforcement of contracts. Negotiation and enforcement in alien parts of the world require the development of a standardized system of weights and measures.

As development continues, the rise of capital markets (and the protection of associated property rights), creates social capital and enables citizens to gain wealth. Technology plays an instrumental role in the continued development of manufacturing sectors, and acts to lower transaction costs in several ways. The most substantial benefits are generally the result of transportation improvements.

Eventually, society becomes overwhelmingly urban. This final stage of development specialization requires increasing percentages of the resources of the society to be active in the market so that the transaction sector becomes a large share of gross national product. Highly specialized forms of transaction organizations emerge at this stage. Globalized specialization and division of labor demand institutions to ensure property rights even when trading in neighboring countries enabling capital markets to develop "with credible commitment on the part of the players."&lt;ref name="institutions" /&gt;

North enumerates three primitive types of exchange:
* Tribal Society "relies on a dense social network".(Colson 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;59)
* Bazaars "high measurement costs; continuous effort at clientization; intensive bargaining at every margin"&lt;ref name="institutions" /&gt;
* Long-distance caravan trade illustrates the informal constraints that made trade possible in a world where protection was essential and no organized state existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getcited.org/pub/101883793 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318031951/http://www.getcited.org/pub/101883793 |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
All three methods above are found to be much less likely to evolve than large urban societies.

North's paper concludes with a few intriguing questions which his paper aimed to address:
* What is it about informal constraints that give them such a pervasive  influence upon the long-run character of economies?
* What is the relationship between formal and informal constraints?
* How does an economy develop the informal constraints that make  individuals constrain their behavior so that they make political and judicial systems effective forces for third party enforcement?&lt;ref name="institutions" /&gt;

=== ''Transaction Costs, Institutions, and Economic Performance'' ===
In a 1992 paper, North argues that [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic theory]] overlooks the institutions required to create efficient markets with low monitoring and [[transaction cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transaction costs, institutions, and economic performance|last = North|first = Douglass|publisher = ICS Press|year = 1992|isbn = |location = San Francisco, CA|pages = 5|url = http://khosachonline.ucoz.com/_ld/1/144_chi_ph_gd-th_ch.pdf=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He develops a framework for explaining how institutions change and become more efficient over time.

North theorizes that all transaction costs are rooted in [[information asymmetries]] between the parties to an exchange. Hence, each person must expend resources ascertaining the qualities of the good she is buying and enforcing the terms of the trade. Because these costs pose such a large barrier to economic growth, a central function of political and economic institutions is control them, often by disincentivizing fraud, theft, and other socially detrimental behaviors. Yet those who command the political system will structure these institutions to maximize their personal benefit, rather than the social benefit, so transaction costs will not always be minimized by existing institutions.&lt;ref name="North, Douglass 1992"&gt;North, Douglass.  "Transaction costs, institutions, and economic performance." ICEG 1992. San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly for North, individuals and organizations make their decisions on the basis of imperfect [[ideologies]], which are "mental models" for how the world functions. Therefore, the politicians who craft institutions will, despite their best efforts, occasionally fail to maximize their personal gain. When this happens, entrepreneurs who believe that institutional changes will significantly benefit them will enter the political realm to effect this change. The result is incremental institutional change, pushed forward by self-seeking individuals.

North argues that this change will usually be slow for two reasons. First, the powerful actors in control of the political systems made the institutions for their benefit and so will be reluctant to change them, resulting in [[path dependence]]. Second, informal institutions—like social customs and cultural practices—are by their nature slow to change, yet play a role in determining transaction costs.

North goes on to apply this framework to analyze a few historical examples, including the [[Green Revolution]], the [[American Revolution]], and [[imperial Spain]], as well as to offer some general policy recommendations.&lt;ref name="North, Douglass 1992"/&gt;

===''Violence and the Rise of Open-Access Orders''===
In ''Violence and the Rise of Open-Access Orders'', North, Wallis, and Weingast integrate a theory of politics with a theory of economics to explain the institutions, i.e. the rules governing behavior, that develop in human societies. In their view, the primary task of any set of institutions is to limit violence among individuals. They focus on two sets of institutions—which they call social orders—that accomplish this task, but which also have different effects on economic growth.&lt;ref name=violence&gt;North, Douglass. Wallis, John. Weingast, Barry. "[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236715418_Violence_and_the_Rise_of_Open-Access_Orders Violence and the Rise of Open Access Orders]." Journal of Democracy. 2009. 20(1). 55–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first set of institutions are called "limited access orders," and they are characterized by elite control of the political and economic systems to extract rents. Violence is limited because the most powerful actors maintain law and order in order to protect their rents. However, their means of maintaining law and order require supporting economic and political monopolies, which stunt economic growth.

The second set of institutions that North et al. propose are called "open access orders," and they limit violence through a politically controlled military. These societies allow anyone who meets some impersonal criteria to form political and economic organizations, resulting in a [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeterian]] process of "[[Creative Destruction]]." The military limits societal violence, and the political actors that control this military are themselves constrained by the constant competition for political and economic power that this process of creative destruction entails. Unlike limited access orders, open access orders stimulate economic growth since solutions to economic and political challenges can come from any individual in society, rather than a select few.

North et al. argue that modern open access orders emerged from limited access orders through a two-step process: first, the application of impersonal laws to elites and the consolidation of military power, and second, the extension of elite privileges to the rest of society. They apply this theory to explain the legitimacy of elections within different societies and to explain why economic growth is more consistent in modern open access orders than it is in limited access orders.&lt;ref name=violence /&gt;

'''''Et in Arcadia ego''''' (also known as '''''Les bergers d'Arcadie''''' or '''''The Arcadian Shepherds''''')&lt;ref&gt;Braider, Christopher, ''Refiguring the Real: Picture and Modernity in Word and Image, 1400–1700'', p. 292, 2015, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|1400872758}}, 9781400872756&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1637–38 painting by the leading painter of the classical [[17th-century French art|French Baroque]] style, [[Nicolas Poussin]] (1594–1665). It depicts a [[pastoral]] scene with idealized [[shepherd]]s from [[classical antiquity]] clustering around an austere [[tomb]]. It is held in the [[Louvre]], [[Paris]].

Poussin painted two versions of the subject under the same title; his earlier version, painted in 1627, is held at [[Chatsworth House]]. An earlier treatment of the theme was painted by [[Guercino]] circa 1618–22, also titled ''[[Et in Arcadia ego (Guercino)|Et in Arcadia ego]]''.

==Title==
The translation of the phrase is "Even in Arcadia, there am I". The usual interpretation is that "I" refers to [[Death (personification)|Death]], and "Arcadia" means a utopian land. It would thus be a ''[[memento mori]]''. During Antiquity, many Greeks lived in cities close to the sea, and led an urban life. Only [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadians]], in the middle of the [[Peloponnese]], lacked cities, were far from the sea, and led a shepherd life. Thus Arcadia symbolized pure, rural, idyllic life, far from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{etymonline|Arcadia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Poussin's biographer, [[André Félibien]], interpreted the phrase to mean that "the person buried in this tomb lived in Arcadia"; in other words, that the person too once enjoyed the pleasures of life on earth. This reading was common in the 18th and 19th centuries. For example, [[William Hazlitt]] wrote that Poussin "describes some shepherds wandering out in a morning of the spring, and coming to a tomb with this inscription, 'I also was an Arcadian'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The round table: a collection of essays on literature, men, and manners, by William Hazlitt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HYPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=hazlitt+%22round+table%22+%22why+the+arts+are+not+progressive%22&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Why the arts are not progressive – A fragment|year=1817|page=258|publisher=Constable|location=Edinburgh and London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former interpretation ("ego" referring to Death) is now generally considered more likely; the ambiguity of the phrase is the subject of a famous essay by the [[art historian]] [[Erwin Panofsky]] (see References). Either way, the sentiment was meant to set up an [[irony|ironic]] contrast between the shadow of death and the usual idle merriment that the [[nymph]]s and swains of ancient Arcadia were thought to embody.

==Inspiration==
[[Image:Et-in-Arcadia-ego.jpg|thumb|[[Et in Arcadia ego (Guercino)|Guercino's version]] of the subject.]]
The first appearance of a tomb with a memorial inscription (to [[Daphnis]]) amid the idyllic settings of Arcadia appears in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]'' V 42 ff. Virgil took the idealized Sicilian rustics that had first appeared in the ''Idylls'' of [[Theocritus]] and set them in the primitive Greek district of Arcadia (see Eclogues VII and X). The idea was taken up anew in the circle of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] in the 1460s and 1470s, during the [[Florentine Renaissance]].

In his pastoral work ''Arcadia'' (1504), [[Jacopo Sannazaro]] fixed the Early Modern perception of Arcadia as a lost world of [[idyll]]ic bliss, remembered in regretful dirges. The first pictorial representation of the familiar ''memento mori'' theme that was popularized in 16th-century Venice, now made more concrete and vivid by the inscription &lt;small&gt;ET IN ARCADIA EGO&lt;/small&gt;, is [[Et in Arcadia ego (Guercino)|Guercino]]'s version, painted between 1618 and 1622 (in the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]], Rome), in which the inscription gains force from the prominent presence of a [[Skull (mythology)|skull]] in the foreground, beneath which the words are carved.

==1627 version==
[[Image:Poussin1627.jpg|thumb|[[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin's]] 1627 version of the ''Arcadian Shepherds'', in [[Chatsworth House]], depicting a different tomb with the same inscription.]]
Poussin's own first version of the painting (now in [[Chatsworth House]]) was probably commissioned as a reworking of Guercino's version. It is in a far more [[Baroque]] style than the later version, characteristic of Poussin's early work. In the Chatsworth painting the shepherds are actively discovering the half-hidden and overgrown tomb, and are reading the inscription with curious expressions. The shepherdess, standing at the left, is posed in sexually suggestive fashion, very different from her austere counterpart in the later version. The later version has a far more geometric composition and the figures are much more contemplative. The mask-like face of the shepherdess conforms to the conventions of the Classical "Greek profile".

==Interpretation==
{{more citations needed|date=January 2017}}
The most important difference between the two versions is that in the latter version, one of the two shepherds recognizes the shadow of his companion on the tomb and circumscribes the silhouette with his finger. According to an ancient tradition (see [[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' XXXV 5, 15), this is the moment in which the art of painting is first discovered. Thus, the shepherd's shadow is the first image in art history. But the shadow on the tomb is also a symbol of death (in the first version symbolized by a skull on the top of the tomb). The meaning of this highly intricate composition seems to be that, from prehistory onward, the discovery of art has been the creative response of humankind to the shocking fact of mortality. Thus, death’s claim to rule even Arcadia is challenged by art (symbolized by the beautifully dressed maiden), who must insist that she was discovered in Arcadia too, and that she is the legitimate ruler everywhere, whilst death only usurps its power. In the face of death, art's duty—indeed, her ''raison d’être''—is to recall absent loved ones, console anxieties, evoke and reconcile conflicting emotions, surmount isolation, and facilitate the expression of the unutterable.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Becht-Jördens, Gereon; Wehmeier, Peter M. (2003). Picasso und die christliche Ikonographie. Dietrich Reimer Verlag, Berlin. pp. 181–209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpted versions==
[[Image:Shugborough arcadia.jpg|thumb|The Shugborough relief, adapted from an engraving of Poussin's second version.]]

The undated mid-eighteenth-century marble bas-relief is part of the Shepherds Monument, a garden feature at [[Shugborough House]], Staffordshire, England. Beneath it is the cryptic [[Shugborough inscription]], as yet undeciphered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shugborough.org.uk/AcademyShepherdsMon-169 |title=The Shepherd's Monument |publisher=Shugborough |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reversed composition suggests that it was copied from an [[engraving]], the compositions of which are commonly reversed because direct copies to the plate produce mirror images on printing.

In 1832 another relief was sculpted as part of the monument marking Poussin's tomb in Rome, on which it appears beneath a bust of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.duepassinelmistero.com/_borders/POUSSIN_3.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the art historian Richard Verdi, it appears as if the shepherds are contemplating "their own author's death."&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, G. &amp; Scott, K., [http://assets.cambridge.org/052164/0040/sample/0521640040WSC00.pdf ''Commemorating Poussin: Reception and Interpretation of the Artist''], [[Cambridge University Press]], 1999. Cf. "Introduction: Commemorating Poussin" by Katie Scott, p. 9. "As Richard Verdi has noted, this change of context resulted in Poussin's shepherds being led to contemplate their own author's death, and invited the viewer to ponder the monument with the same solemnity and poignancy with which the shepherds brood on Death's incursion into Arcadia."
* Also cf. Verdi, Richard, "Poussin's giants: from romanticism to surrealism", in this collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eugene Converse Murdock''' (April 30, 1921 – July 23, 1992) was an historian and author best known for his research into [[baseball]].

==Early life and education==
Eugene C. Murdock was born in [[Lakewood, Ohio]], on April 30, 1921, and attended school there. His father, Stanely H. Murdock, worked for the city of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], in the division of engineering and construction. Stanley and his wife Elizabeth had three sons, Donald L., Stanley H., Jr., Eugene C., and one daughter, Marjorie C.&lt;ref name=PD19552 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PD1964 /&gt;

A young Eugene Murdock saw his first major league baseball game on August 10, 1929, at [[League Park]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] where the [[New York Yankees]] played the [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]] .&lt;ref name=MC2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SABR /&gt; As he grew older, Murdock would serve as sports editor of his high school newspaper.&lt;ref name=MC2012 /&gt; Baseball and writing would be lifelong passions of Murdock's, and he would go on to become a major researcher into the history of the sport.

Murdock was a student at [[Wooster College]] in September 1939, completed his bachelor's degree by December 1942, and then joined the Army.&lt;ref name=MC2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SABR /&gt; After serving in the Army, Murdock entered [[Columbia University]] in 1946. Working with [[Allan Nevins]] at Columbia, Murdock learned to appreciate the significance of oral history research.&lt;ref name=SABR /&gt; Murdock graduated with his MA in 1948 and Ph.D. in 1951.&lt;ref name=MC2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SABR /&gt;

==Career==
Murdock's first teaching assignment was at [[University of Rio Grande|Rio Grande College]]&lt;ref name=PD1955 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PD19552 /&gt; in southern Ohio beginning in 1952.&lt;ref name=SABR&gt;{{cite web
 |url= http://sabr.org/content/sabr-salute-eugene-murdock
 |title= SABR Salute: Eugene Murdock
 |website= Society for American Baseball Research
 |date= 1991
 |access-date= 27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murdock then moved to [[Marietta College]]&lt;ref name=PD1967 /&gt; in 1956 where he was an assistant professor in history, being promoted to full professor in 1963. Murdock became Chair of the department in 1972, holding that position until his retirement in 1986. After his retirement, Murdock was named Historian of the College.&lt;ref name=SABR /&gt;

In 1991, Murdock received the Distinguished Service Award from the Ohio Academy of History.&lt;ref name=SABR /&gt;

==Society for American Baseball Research==
Since 1973, Murdock was a frequent contributor to the [[Society for American Baseball Research|SABR]] Baseball Research Journal. His first article looked at players in the 19th-century, [http://research.sabr.org/journals/pre-1900-batting-stars The Pre-1900 Batting Stars].&lt;ref name=SABR /&gt;

Murdock served as President of SABR from 1976 to 1978, but served in various positions both before and after. Prior to serving as president, Murdock was Chair of the SABR Hall of Fame Committee. He also was head of the SABR Nominating Committee (1981-1982) when he proposed two-year terms for the operating officers. This proposal would later be adopted by SABR.&lt;ref name=SABR /&gt;

==Baseball oral history research==
Traveling across the United States between 1973 and 1987, Murdock interviewed 76 former baseball players.&lt;ref name=SABR /&gt; His time with Prof. Nevins at Columbia impressed on Murdock the importance of interviewing older persons as well as those not as well known as some.&lt;ref name=SABR /&gt; The interviews range from 30 minutes to multiple hours, and the audio is now available on [[Cleveland Public Library]]'s [https://cdm16014.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p4014coll27/search/searchterm/Eugene+Converse+Murdock+interviewed/field/descri/mode/exact/conn/and/order/title Digital Gallery]. The interviews are also featured in Murdock's book [https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/23140595 Baseball Players and Their Times, Oral Histories of the Game: 1920-40].&lt;ref name=SABR /&gt;

The oral history collection is part of Murdock's voluminous baseball research papers. Initially offered to [[Marietta College]] but declined, the collection was "promptly and eagerly" accepted by Cleveland Public Library in 1992. In addition to the oral histories, the overall collection also includes "major league biographies, annuals, and scrapbooks, covering the  years 1910-1976."&lt;ref name=EAD /&gt;

==Other research==
Murdock also wrote two books on the draft during the [[American Civil War]]: ''Patriotism Limited: 1862-1865'' (1967) and ''One Million Men: The Civil War Draft in the North'' (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Zilina zapalkaren.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Reconstructed historical factory in [[Žilina]] ([[Slovakia]]) for production of safety matches. Originally built in 1915 for the business firm ''Wittenberg and son''.]]

The '''factory system''' is a method of [[manufacturing]] using machinery and [[division of labour]].  Because of the high capital cost of machinery and factory buildings, factories were typically privately owned by wealthy individuals who employed the operative labour.  Use of machinery with the division of labour reduced the required skill level of workers and also increased the output per worker.

The factory system was first adopted in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] at the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the late 18th century and later spread around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Walker1993|Walker 1993]], pp.&amp;nbsp;187–88.&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced the [[putting-out system]]. The main characteristic of the factory system is the use of machinery, originally powered by water or steam and later by electricity.  Other characteristics of the system mostly derive from the use of machinery or [[economies of scale]], the [[centralization]] of [[factories]], and [[standardization]] of [[interchangeable parts]].

==Characteristics==
The defining characteristics of the factory system are:
* The factory system is considered a  form of production. The operative labour generally does not own a significant share of the enterprise.  The capitalist owners provide all machinery, buildings, management and administration, raw or semi-finished materials and are responsible for the sale of all production, as well as any resulting losses.
* Use of [[unskilled labour]] – Before the factory some systems had many products such as shoes and muskets were made by skilled craftsmen who usually custom-made an entire article. In contrast, factories practiced [[division of labour]], in which most workers were either low skilled labourers who tended or operated machinery, or unskilled labourers who moved materials, semi-finished and finished goods. There were a few skilled mechanics.  Division of labour was also practiced by the [[putting out system]] in which, for example, pieces of leather were cut off-site and brought to a central shop to be made into shoes or other articles.&lt;ref name = "Thomson 1989"/&gt;
* [[Economies of scale]] – Factories produced products on a much larger scale than the putting out or crafts systems.  Because factories could oversupply local markets, access to transportation was important so that goods could be widely distributed. Factories used far less manpower per unit of production and therefore lowered product cost.
* Location – Before the widespread use of [[steam engine]]s and railroads, most factories were located at water power sites and near water transportation.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;  Railroads became widespread (itself a consequence of steam power becoming more efficient and affordable), so factories could be located away from water power sites but nearer railroads.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1951"&gt;

 |first= George Rogers
|year=1951 |publisher = Rinehart &amp; Co.
|location=New York, Toronto
|isbn= 978-0-87332-101-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Centralization]] – The cost and complexity of machinery, especially that powered by water or steam, was more than cottage industry workers could afford or had the skills to maintain. The exception was the sewing machine, which allowed [[putting out system|putting out]] of sewing to continue for decades after the rise of factories.  Home spinning and weaving were displaced in the years following the introduction of factory production, especially as distribution became easier.&lt;ref name = "Thomson 1989"/&gt;

:Workers and machines were brought together in  a central factory complex specially designed to handle the machinery and flow of materials.  Although the earliest factories were usually all under one roof, different operations might be done on different floors. (Multi-story buildings were common because they facilitated transmission of power through [[line shaft]]s.)  In large factories, such as [[Baldwin locomotive works]], different processes were performed in different buildings.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

:Foundry and blacksmith operations were normally kept in a separate building for reasons of safety, cleanliness and health.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Daniel|title=Frederick W. Taylor and the Rise of Scientific Management|year=1980|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=0-299-08160-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The efficiency of steam engines increases with size. Because of this, the smallest steam engines were about 2 horsepower, which was larger than needed by most workshops. Consequently until electrification in the 1910s and 1920s most workshops relied on manual power or rented space in ''power buildings'' which provided a centrally powered [[line shaft]].&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;
* [[Standardization]] and uniformity – Components were made to standard specifications, such as soles, heels and uppers for shoes themselves made to uniform sizes.  Uniformity was mainly due to the precision possible from machinery, but also, quality was overseen by management.  The quality of many machine operations such as sewing was superior to hand methods.&lt;ref name = "Thomson 1989"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  Near the end of the 19th century metal [[interchangeable parts]] became widely used.&lt;ref name =Hounshell-1984&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Guarantee of supply. Factories were able to produce and distribute a steady supply of goods.

Workers were paid either daily [[wage]]s or for [[piece work]], either in the form of money or some combination of money, housing, meals and goods from a company store (the [[truck system]]). Piece work presented accounting difficulties, especially as volumes increased and workers did a narrower scope of work on each piece.  Piece work went out of favor with the advent of the production line, which was designed on standard times for each operation in the sequence, and workers had to keep up with the work flow.

==History==
[[File:New Lanark buildings 2009.jpg|right|thumb|250px|New Lanark mill]]
One of the earliest factories was [[John Lombe]]'s [[Derby Industrial Museum|water-powered silk mill]] at [[Derby]], operational by 1721. By 1746, an integrated [[brass mill]] was working at [[Warmley]] near [[Bristol]]. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on  site. [[Josiah Wedgwood]] in Staffordshire and [[Matthew Boulton]] at his [[Soho Manufactory]] were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system.

The factory system began widespread use somewhat later when [[cotton]] [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] was mechanized.

The first use of an integrated system, where cotton came in and was spun, bleached dyed and woven into finished cloth, was at mills in Waltham and Lowell, Massachusetts. These became known as [[Lowell Mills]] and the [[Waltham-Lowell system]].

The [[Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company|Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company's Bridgewater Foundry]], which began operation in 1836, was one of the earliest factories to use modern materials handling such as cranes and rail tracks through the buildings for handling heavy items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution  |last=Musson |author2=Robinson |year=1969 |publisher =University of Toronto Press |pages=491–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arkwright===

[[Image:Cromford 1771 mill.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Cromford mill as it is today.]]

[[Richard Arkwright]] is the person credited with being the brains behind the growth of factories and the [[Derwent Valley Mills]]. After he patented his [[water frame]] in 1769, he established [[Cromford Mill]], in [[Derbyshire]], England. The factory system was a new way of organizing [[Workforce|labour]] made necessary by the development of machines which were too large to house in a worker's cottage.  Working hours were as long as they had been for the farmer, that is, from dawn to dusk, six days per week. Overall, this practice essentially reduced skilled and unskilled workers to replaceable commodities.

===Interchangeable parts===
Mass production using [[interchangeable parts]] was first achieved in 1803 by [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] in cooperation with [[Henry Maudslay]], and Simon Goodrich, under the management of (with contributions by) Brigadier-General Sir [[Samuel Bentham]], the Inspector General of Naval Works at [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] at [[Portsmouth Dockyard]], for the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic War. By 1808 annual production had reached 130,000 [[Block (sailing)|sailing blocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Enlightenment &amp; measurement |publisher=Making the modern world |url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/stories/enlightenment_and_measurement/05.ST.02/?scene=3&amp;tv=true |place=[[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Portsmouth dockyard | place =UK |url=http://www.portsmouthdockyard.org.uk/Page%206.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution=Block |title=Collections |publisher=Science museum |contribution-url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/collections/exhiblets/block/ |place=UK | type = exhiblet}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Gilbert |first=KR |title=The Portsmouth Block-making Machinery |place=London |year=1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cooper |first=CC |title= The Production Line at Portsmouth Block Mill | journal=Industrial Archaeology Review |volume=VI |year=1982 |pages=28–44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cooper |first=CC |title=The Portsmouth System of Manufacture |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=25 |year = 1984 | pages =182–225}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Coad |first=Jonathan |title=The Royal Dockyards 1690–1850 |place=Aldershot |year=1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Coad |first=Jonathan | title =The Portsmouth Block Mills : Bentham, Brunel and the start of the Royal Navy’s Industrial Revolution |year=2005 |isbn=1-873592-87-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wilkin |first=Susan |title=The application of emerging new technologies by Portsmouth Dockyard, 1790–1815 |publisher=The Open University |type=PhD Thesis |year=1999}} (copies available from the British Thesis service of the British Library).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last=Cantrell |editor1-first=J | editor2-last =Cookson |editor2-first=G |title=Henry Maudslay and the Pioneers of the Machine Age |place=Stroud |year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of working did not catch on in general manufacturing in Britain for many decades, and when it did it was imported from America, becoming known as the ''[[American system of manufacturing]]'', even though it originated in England.

==Societal effects==
Much manufacturing in the 18th century was carried out in homes under the domestic or [[putting-out system]], especially the [[weaving]] of cloth and spinning of thread and yarn, often with just a single loom or spinning wheel. As these devices were mechanized, machine made goods were able to underprice the cottagers, leaving them unable to earn enough to make their effort worthwhile.  Other products such as [[nail (fastener)|nails]] had long been produced in factory workshops, increasingly diversified using the [[division of labour]] to increase the efficiency of the system.

Factory workers typically lived within walking distance to work until the introduction of bicycles and electric street railways in the 1890s.  Thus the factory system was partly responsible for the rise of urban living, as large numbers of workers migrated into the towns in search of employment in the factories.  Many mills had to provide dormitories for workers, especially for girls and women.

The transition to industrialisation was not without difficulty. For example, a group of English workers known as [[Luddite]]s formed to protest against industrialisation and sometimes [[sabotage]]d factories. They continued an already established tradition of workers opposing labour saving machinery. Numerous inventors in the textile industry such as [[John Kay (spinning frame)|John Kay]] and [[Samuel Crompton]], suffered harassment when developing their machines or devices.
[[Image:Soho Manufactory ca 1800.jpg|thumb|right|The Soho Manufactory in 1800.]]
In other industries the transition to factory production was not so divisive.

Until the late 19th century it was common to work 12 hours a day, six days a week in most factories; however long hours were also common outside factories.

Debate arose concerning the morality of the system, as workers complained about unfair working conditions prior to the passage of labour laws. One of the problems concerned women's labour; in many cases women were paid almost a quarter of what men made.  Child labour was also a major part of the system, and was vehemently argued by those who deemed it immoral.  However, in the early 19th century, education was not compulsory and in many families having children work was necessary due to low incomes ([[Samuel Slater]] employed children but was required to provide basic education). Children commonly did farm labour and produced goods for the household.  Besides working in factories children worked in mines.  Automation in the late 19th century is credited with displacing child labour, with the automatic glass bottle blowing machine (ca. 1890) cited as an example, having been said to do more to end child labour than child labour laws.  Years of schooling began to increase sharply from the end of the 19th century.

Some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers. One of the earliest such reformers was [[Robert Owen]], known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the [[Robert Owen#Philanthropy in New Lanark (1800)|New Lanark mills]], and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the [[Utopian socialism|early socialist movement]].

[[Karl Marx]] worried that the capitalist system would eventually lead to wages only sufficient for subsistence due to the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]].  Subsistence wages were indeed the case in parts of England.  The [[British Agricultural Revolution]] had been reducing the need for labour on farms for over a century and these workers were forced to sell their labour wherever they could.  Conditions were particularly bad during the depression years of the late 1830s to early 1840s.  The depression was immediately followed by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish famine]] of 1845–50 which brought large numbers of Irish immigrants to seek work in the English and American factories.

One of the best known accounts of factory workers’ living conditions during the Industrial Revolution is [[Friedrich Engels|Friedrich Engels']] ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]''.  By the late 1880s Engels noted that the extreme poverty and lack of sanitation he wrote about in 1844 had largely disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Preface to the later editions (post 1887) of ''Conditions of the Working Class in England in 1844''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life''', formerly the '''Museum of the Southern Jewish Experience''', is a [[non-profit]] Jewish organization based in [[Jackson, Mississippi]] that provides a variety of educational, cultural and religious services to underserved Jewish communities throughout the [[Southern United States|South]].

==Overview==

Founded in 1986 as the Museum of the Southern Jewish Experience, the Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life provides educational and rabbinic services to isolated Jewish communities, documents and preserves the rich history of the Southern Jewish experience, and promotes a Jewish cultural presence. It is named after [[Stephen Goldring]] and [[Malcolm Woldenberg]], both New Orleans-based businessmen and philanthropists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isjl.org/goldring-and-woldenberg.html|title=ISJL - Stephen Goldring and Malcolm Woldenberg|author=|date=|website=Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macy B. Hart, a longtime director of the Henry S. Jacobs Camp in [[Utica, Mississippi]], established the Museum in an effort to preserve the artifacts and history of small Jewish communities across the [[Southern United States|South]] in risk of extinction. 

In 2000, Hart expanded the museum into the Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life. Incorporating the research and historic preservation work of the Museum, the Institute opened in [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and created new departments of Rabbinic Services, Education, and Cultural Programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isjl.org/about/index.html|title=ISJL - About|author=|date=|website=Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Funded by both large foundations and individual patrons, the Institute serves the spiritual, educational, and cultural needs of isolated and underserved Jewish communities in the South. Many of communities have neither a full-time [[rabbi]] nor a full-time [[Jewish education|Jewish educator]]. In turn, the Institute supports these communities through providing the services of an itinerant rabbi, a non-denominational religious school curriculum written and implemented by a team of educators, and a variety of cultural programs. The Institute serves a thirteen-state region:

==Educational Services==

The Education Department aims to raise the level of Jewish education in small cities and towns of the region. Over the past few years, the Institute has developed a complete and detailed non-denominational [[Hebrew school|religious school]] curriculum. The [[curriculum]] is distributed to partner congregations and is supplemented by community visits by the Institute's ten Education Fellows. Now in its tenth year, 70 congregations in 13 states have implement the curriculum in their religious schools.

==Rabbinic Services==

The Rabbinic Services Department nurtures religious life in small communities and to ensure that southern Jews have access to rabbinic services regardless of location.[http://www.isjl.org/rabbinic/index.html] Travelling to congregations without a full-time rabbi, the Institute's itinerant [[rabbi]] leads [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|Holiday services]], addresses school groups and community organizations, teaches [[Torah]], and ministers at life cycle events.

==Museum and Historical Research==

The Museum of the Southern Jewish Experience and the documentation of the history of Southern Jews continue to be integral parts of the Institute. The Museum  completed its first building in 1989 on the grounds of Jacobs Camp in [[Utica, Mississippi|Utica]]. In 1992, the museum entered into a preservation agreement with the local congregation in [[Natchez, Mississippi]], which deeded their historic [[synagogue]] to the Museum. The Museum has created several award-winning exhibits, including "From Alsace to America: Discovering a Southern Jewish Heritage" and "Bagels and Grits: Images of Southern Jewish Life."

Working in tandem with the Museum is the History Department, which actively works to gather information about every Jewish community that ever existed in the South. This research manifests itself in scholarly historical publications as well as through the Institute's Digital Archival Project, an online compendium of short histories of significant Jewish communities and congregations.

==Cultural Programming==

The Institute works to bring leading Jewish cultural programs to small communities in the South. Projects include Jewish Cinema South, the Southern States Jewish Literary Series, and other events and exhibitions.

In Fall 2007, Jewish Cinema South presented Jewish film festivals in the following cities:
*[[Dothan, Alabama]]
*[[Florence, Alabama]]
*[[Mobile, Alabama]]
*[[Macon, Georgia]]
*[[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]
*[[Jackson, Mississippi]]
*[[Jackson, Tennessee]]

The '''Guinea-Bissau Civil War''' was fought from 7 June 1998 to 10 May 1999 and was triggered by an attempted [[coup d'état]] against the government of [[Heads of State of Guinea-Bissau|President]] [[João Bernardo Vieira]] led by [[Brigadier General|Brigadier-General]] [[Ansumane Mané]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, Guinea Bissau: government, in depth, Negotiations, Veira's surrender and the end of the conflict, viwed 12 July 2013, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=68&amp;regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa#&lt;/ref&gt; Government forces, backed by neighbouring states, clashed with the coup leaders who had quickly gained almost total control over the country's armed forces.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The conflict resulted in the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conflicttransform.net/Guinea.pdf|publisher=Conflicttransform.net|accessdate=12 October 2014|title=Conflict Transformation, Guinea-Bassau, The Military Crisis in Guinea-Bassau, Terhi Lehtinen|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231130933/http://www.conflicttransform.net/Guinea.pdf|archivedate=31 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An eventual peace agreement in November 1998 provided for a national unity government and new elections in the next year. However, a subsequent and brief outbreak of fighting in May 1999 ended with the deposing of Vieira on 10 May 1999 when Vieira signed an unconditional surrender.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Pre-conflict tension==
[[Guinea-Bissau]] gained independence from Portugal in 1974 after an eleven and a half year long [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence|war of independence]]. In January 1998, ten fighters from the [[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance]] (MDFC), an insurgent separatist group from the [[Senegal|Senegalese]] region of [[Casamance]], were killed and another forty were arrested following clashes with the [[Military of Guinea-Bissau|armed forces]] in two towns on the northern border of Guinea-Bissau.&lt;ref name="BercovitchFretter2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacob Bercovitch|author2=Judith Fretter|title=Regional Guide to International Conflict and Management from 1945 to 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiVzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101|date=25 November 2004|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6736-4|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:João Bernardo Vieira.jpg|thumb|180px|[[João Bernardo Vieira|João Bernardo "Nino" Vieira]], [[President of Guinea-Bissau]] (1980-1999)]]

The armed forces deployed reinforcements along the border with Casamance to prevent the separatists from entering the country. In late January, following the seizure in Guinea-Bissau of a cache of weapons, a number of officers of the armed forces were arrested on charges of supplying arms to the Casamance separatists. 

On 30 January 1998, Guinea-Bissau's defense minister announced the suspension of the [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the armed forces, [[Brigadier General|Brigadier-General]] [[Ansumane Mané]] on the grounds of [[dereliction of duty]] in view of the fact that the weapons impounded in the previous month had been taken from a military depot of the Guinea-Bissau armed forces.&lt;ref name="MendyJr.2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Karibe Mendy|author2=Lobban Jr.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbJ8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93|date=17 October 2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8027-6|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1998, following protest by opposition parties at delays in the organization of legislative [[elections]], an independent national elections commission was established. The elections were due to be held in July. In April, Mané publicly accused the Minister of Defense and a group of officers in the armed forces of involvement in arms trafficking to the Casamance separatists. At the sixth [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC]] congress held May 1998, President [[João Bernardo Vieira]] was re-elected president of the party.

==Coup and civil war (1998-1999)==
Vieira dismissed the suspended Mané and appointed General Humberto Gomes  to replace him on 6 June 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Newsletters/irinw6898.html "GUINEA BISSAU: Fighting in capital continues"], IRIN-West Africa Update 224, 8 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 June, rebelling troops led by Ansumane Mané seized control of military barracks in [[Bissau]] as well as other strategic locations in the city, including the international airport. Mané subsequently demanded  the resignation of Vieira and his administration and the conduct of free and democratic elections in July. With the support of 1,300 Senegalese and 400 [[Guinea]]n soldiers, troops loyal to the government attempted unsuccessfully to regain control of rebel held areas of the city and heavy fighting ensued. 

In the following days more than 3,000 foreign nationals were evacuated from the capital by ship to Senegal. An estimated further 200,000 residents of Bissau fled the city, prompting fears of a [[humanitarian]] disaster, with the hostilities preventing aid organizations from distributing emergency food and medical supplies to the refugees. Fighting continued into July, with many members of the Guinea-Bissau armed forces reportedly defecting to the side of the rebels. 

On 26 July, following mediation by a delegation from the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP), the government and the rebels agreed to implement a truce. On 25 August, representatives of the government and the rebels met under the auspices of the CPLP and [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] on [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal Island]], [[Cape Verde]], where an agreement was reached to transform the existing truce into a [[Cease fire|cease-fire]]. The accord provided for the reopening of the international airport and for the deployment of international forces to maintain and supervise the cease-fire.

In September 1998, talks between the government and the rebels resumed in [[Abidjan]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]]. The rebels demanded that all Senegalese and Guinean forces be withdrawn from the country as a precondition to a definitive peace agreement, which was rejected by the government. The rebels, in turn, rejected a proposal for the establishment by Senegal of a [[buffer zone]] within Guinea-Bissau territory along the border with Casamance. 

In October the rebels agreed to a government proposal for the creation of a [[demilitarized zone]] separating the opposing forces in the capital. Before the proposal could be formally endorsed, the cease-fire collapsed as fighting erupted in the capital and several other towns. On 20 October, the government imposed a nationwide curfew, and on the following day President Vieira declared a unilateral cease-fire. 

By that time almost all of the government troops had defected to the side of rebel forces, which were believed to control approximately 99% of the country. On 23 October, Brigadier-General Mané agreed to observe a 48-hour truce to allow Vieira time to clarify his proposals for a negotiated peace settlement and agreement was subsequently reached for direct talks to be held in [[Banjul]], [[The Gambia]]. At the talks, which took place on 29 October, the rebels confirmed that they would not seek Vieira's resignation.

Further talks held under the aegis of ECOWAS in [[Abuja|Abuja, Nigeria]], resulted in the signing of a peace accord on 1 November. Under the accord's terms, the two sides reaffirmed the cease-fire of 25 August and resolved that the withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops from Guinea Bissau be conducted simultaneously with the deployment of an [[ECOMOG]] (ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group) interposition force, which would guarantee security on the border with Senegal. 

It was also agreed that a Government of National Unity would be established to include rebel representatives and that presidential and legislative elections would be held no later than March 1999. In early November 1998, an agreement was reached on the composition of a joint executive commission to implement the peace accord. Later that month the commission approved the structure of the new government, which was to comprise ten ministers and seven secretaries of state. 

On 3 December, [[Francisco Fadul]] was appointed [[Heads of Government of Guinea-Bissau|Prime Minister]] and later that month Vieira and Mané reached agreement on the allocation of portfolios to the two sides. The first contingent of 100 ECOMOG troops arrived in late December. At the same time, the [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1216|Resolution 1216]] which called for both parties to form a [[government of national unity]] and hold elections by the end of March 1999.

=== 1999 ===
In January 1999, Fadul announced that presidential and legislative elections would not take place in March as envisaged in the Abuja accord, and would be delayed until the end of the year. Also in January agreement was reached between the government, rebels and ECOWAS on the strength of the ECOMOG interposition force, which was to comprise some 710 troops. Agreement was also reached on a timetable for the withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops from Guinea-Bissau. 

At the end of January 1999, hostilities resumed in the capital resulting in numerous fatalities and the displacement of some 250,000 residents. On 9 February, talks between the government and the rebels produced agreement on a cease-fire that provided for the immediate withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops. 

At a meeting held in [[Lomé, Togo]] on 17 February, João Bernardo Vieira and Ansumane Mané pledged never again to resort to armed conflict. On 20 February the new Government of National Unity was announced. The [[disarmament]] of rebel troops and those loyal to the president, as provided for under the Abuja accord, began in early March. The withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops was completed that month following an extension of the deadline from 28 February to 16 March, owing to logistical problems. 

In April, a report was released by the National People's Assembly, which exonerated Mané on charges of trafficking arms to the Casamance rebels. Although the report, which had been due for release in June 1998 when hostilities began, called for the reinstatement of Mané as Chief of Staff of the armed forces, it revealed that President Vieira's presidential guard had been heavily implicated in arms trafficking. The [[United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in Guinea-Bissau]] was subsequently established to monitor the general elections and the implementation of the Abuja Agreement.

===Second coup (May 1999)===
[[File:Bissau former pres palace.jpg|thumb|300px|The war damaged and abandoned former presidential palace in the capital [[Bissau]].]]

In early May 1999, Vieira announced that legislative and presidential elections would take place on 28 December, but he was overthrown by the rebel [[military junta]] on 7 May, to widespread condemnation by the international community. Fighting had erupted in Bissau on the previous day when rebel troops seized stockpiles of weapons that had been held at the international airport since the disarmament of the rival forces in March. 

The rebels, who claimed that their actions had been prompted by Vieira's refusal to allow his presidential guard to be disarmed, surrounded the presidential palace and forced its surrender. Vieira subsequently took refuge at the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] embassy, where on 10 May 1999 he signed an unconditional surrender.

==Post-conflict events==
The President of the [[National People's Assembly of Guinea-Bissau|National People's Assembly]], [[Malam Bacai Sanhá]], was appointed acting president of the republic until elections were held. The Government of National Unity, including the ministers appointed by Vieira, remained in office. At a meeting of the ruling bodies of the PAIGC that month, [[Manuel Saturnino da Costa]] was appointed to replace Vieira as party leader. 

At a tripartite meeting conducted in late May by representatives of the government, the military junta and the political parties, agreement was reached that Vieira should stand trial for his involvement in arms trafficking to the Casamance separatists and for political and economic crimes relating to his terms in office. Vieira subsequently agreed to stand trial, but only after receiving medical treatment abroad, after which he pledged to return to Guinea-Bissau. 

At a meeting of ECOWAS foreign ministers held in Togo in May 1999, Vieira's overthrow was condemned and demands were made for him to be permitted to leave Guinea-Bissau. It was also decided that ECOMOG forces would be withdrawn from the country. The last ECOMOG troops left in early June. 

That month Vieira was permitted to leave Guinea-Bissau to seek medical treatment in France. Sanhá cited humanitarian reasons for allowing Vieira's departure, but stressed that he would return to stand trial. In the same month Sanhá asserted that presidential and legislative elections would take place by 28 November. In July, [[constitutional amendment]]s were introduced that limited the tenure of presidential office to two terms and abolished the [[death penalty]]. It was also stipulated that the country's principal offices of state could only be held by Guinea-Bissau nationals born of Guinea-Bissau parents.

On 28 November 1999, [[Elections in Guinea-Bissau|presidential and legislative elections]] were held with the opposition [[Social Renewal Party (Guinea-Bissau)|Social Renewal Party]] (PRS) winning 38 of 102 seats making it the largest party represented in the National People's Assembly. The long ruling [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) won 24 seats. The PRS presidential candidate, [[Kumba Ialá]], placed first winning 38.81% of the vote. In a run-off held on 16 January 2000, Ialá easily defeated acting President Malam Bacai Sanhá of the PAIGC, winning 72% of the vote. He was sworn in on 17 February 2000.

{{History of the Republic of China}}

As a result of the [[Surrender of Japan]] at the end of [[World War II]], the [[island of Taiwan]] was placed under the governance of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC), ruled by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT),{{efn|Not to be confused with the [[China|People's Republic of China]]}} on [[Retrocession Day|25 October 1945]]. Following the [[February 28 Incident|February 28 massacre in 1947]], [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was [[Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion|declared]] in 1949 by the Governor of [[Taiwan Province]], [[Chen Cheng]], and the ROC [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]].  Following the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, the ROC government was [[Chinese Communist Revolution|forcibly expelled]] from the [[mainland China|mainland]] by the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]], who proclaimed the establishment of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. The KMT retreated to Taiwan and declared [[Taipei]] the temporary capital of the ROC. For many years, the ROC and PRC each continued to claim in the diplomatic arena to be the sole legitimate government of China. In 1971, the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|expelled]] the ROC and replaced it with the PRC.

In 1987, martial law was lifted and Taiwan began the democratisation process beginning the abolition of the Temporary Provisions and culminating with the [[Taiwan presidential election, 1996|first direct president election]] in 1996. By 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) came to power and began to pursue [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese independence and identity]] but efforts to do so are blocked by the PRC.

Because of Taiwan's [[political status of Taiwan|ambiguous political status]], the ROC has participated in a number of international organizations under the name "[[Chinese Taipei]]". Due to the [[One-China policy]] imposed by the PRC government, the PRC considers the ROC ceased to exist and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China and refuses diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the ROC. However, the ROC is still controlling [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen|Quemoy]] and [[Matsu Islands|Lienchiang]].

== Chronology ==
=== Early postwar society ===
The [[World War II|Second World War]]'s hostilities came to a close on 2 September 1945, with the defeat of the [[Empire of Japan]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Taiwan, which had been ceded to Japan by the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] in 1895, was placed under the control of the [[Kuomintang]]-led [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] (ROC) with the promulgation of [[General Order No. 1]] and the signing of the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] on that day.

[[He Yingqin]], the ROC representative at the Japanese surrender ceremonies established the {{Interlanguage link multi|Office of the Chief Executive of Taiwan Province|zh|3=臺灣省行政長官公署}} separate from the provincial-level executive system on [[mainland China]]. After the establishment of the provincial executive office, [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] was appointed Chief Executive. Chen proclaimed 25 October to be [[Retrocession Day]]. However, because Japan had not formally relinquished the sovereignty of Taiwan at that time, [[Allies of World War II]] did not recognize the unilateral annexation of Taiwan by the Republic of China.

Chen Yi's administration was marred by corruption, as well as a lack of discipline in the military police assigned to occupation duties, resulting in a severe undermining of the chain of command. With the rampant corruption in his administration, Chen Yi began to monopolize power. In addition to this, the island's post-war economy was failing and headed into a recession, causing people on the island to endure economic hardship.  The government's program of "De-Japanization" also created cultural estrangement, along with tensions between the growing population of migrants from the mainland and the pre-war residents of the island.  The building tensions erupted in 1947, when the arrest of a cigarette vendor by government agents led to the death of a bystander. The clashes between police and residents that followed quickly spread across the island, and grew into a general rebellion against Chen Yi and the Chief Executive's Office in what came to be known as the [[February 28 Incident]].  Several weeks later, government troops were sent to Taiwan from the mainland to handle the crisis and to suppress any opposition or resistance to the government&lt;!--the ''Clean Countryside'' (清鄉) movement--&gt;. Many prominent individuals in Taiwanese society, as well as other residents of the island, many of whom had nothing to do with the incident, were either killed, imprisoned without trial, or simply disappeared.  The February 28 Incident was a prelude to the  [[White Terror (Taiwan)|white terror]] of the 1950s, resulting in ethnic tensions between pre- and post-war residents, as well as the genesis of the [[Taiwan Independence#History of the Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese independence movement]].

[[File:中華民國第一位民選首都市長吳三連於1951年勝選後 First People-elected Mayor of Taipei, the Capital of TAIWAN.jpg|275px|right|thumb|Non-Kuomintang Taiwanese politician [[Wu San-lien]] (2L) celebrated his landslide victory (65.5%) in the first-time election for [[mayor of Taipei]] in January 1951 with his supporters.]]

After the February 28 Incident, the [[Kuomintang]]-led ROC government reorganized the local government, abolishing the Chief Executive's Office, while establishing a new [[Taiwan province|provincial government]].  [[Wey Daw-ming]], whose parents were scholars, became the first [[Governor of Taiwan Province]] and, during his administration, reduced the scope of the public enterprises, which had grown significantly under Chen Yi.

Wey was succeeded as governor by [[Chen Cheng]] in 1949.  Wey reformed the currency system, replacing the devalued [[old Taiwan dollar]] with the [[New Taiwan dollar]], at a 40,000:1 exchange rate, and implemented the {{Interlanguage link multi|375 Rent Reduction Act|zh|3=耕地三七五減租條例}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.landreform.org.tw/html/02-05.htm |author = Land Reform Museum (土地改革紀念館) |title = Looking for History (尋訪歷史) |language = zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; easing the inflationary situation.

=== Authoritarianism, Martial Rule and Cold War ===
{{Further|White Terror (Taiwan)}}

[[File:U.S. President Eisenhower visited TAIWAN 美國總統艾森豪於1960年6月訪問臺灣台北時與蔣中正總統-2.jpg|275px|right|thumb|With President [[Chiang Kai-shek]], the U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] waves to crowds during his visit to [[Taipei]], Taiwan in June 1960.]]

In 1949, the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] and the [[Kuomintang]] suffered a major defeat in the [[Chinese Civil War]], forcing the Government of the Republic of China to [[KMT retreat to Taiwan in 1949|relocate to Taiwan]].  This allowed the [[Communist Party of China]] to declare the establishment of a new Chinese state: the [[People's Republic of China]].  As the [[Kuomintang]] were establishing a "provisional" base in Taiwan, the party began to plan and threaten counterattacks on the mainland, hoping to retake the Chinese mainland;

With the fall of the mainland, the United States largely wrote off the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-Shek as incompetent, corrupt leaders who deservedly lost and was prepared to grant diplomatic recognition to the PRC. Some influential American voices expressed the cautious optimism that the newly established communist regime would be more honest and concerned about the Chinese people's welfare, especially helped by the fact that the Kuomintang deeply distrusted the US and had little in the way of common, shared values. All of this changed rapidly when the PRC intervened in the [[Korean War]], which ruined any chance of normalizing relations with Washington for years. With mainland China now a sworn enemy of the US, the latter extended a cautious olive branch to Taipei under the adage of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend". The victorious [[Battle of Guningtou]] by the ROC forces against the communist forces helped to boost morale in the ROC Army and diminished any chance by the communist forces to take Taiwan. Subsequently, the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] started to patrol the [[Taiwan Straits]].  By the 1950s, [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty]] was signed and US provided Military Assistance and Support to the ROC forces. The US Army maintained a garrison force in Taiwan until its withdrawal in 1979. The [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty]] was replaced by [[Taiwan Relations Act]] after 1979.

The early years of ROC rule on Taiwan were grim, but by 1955, with the need for a functioning economy that produced something and so-to-speak "pay the monthly bills", the regime began encouraging the growth of light industries such as textiles and transistor radios.

Up and until 1958, small-scale military campaigns between the ROC forces and PLA were carried out across the strait, which lasted until the [[second Taiwan Strait crisis|Second Strait Crisis]]. From that point on, both sides of the strait have ceased all major hostilities against each other. The government under the [[Kuomintang]], through its enforcement of [[martial law]], kept a powerful hold on the state and its people throughout the Cold War. Because the Republic of China was under authoritarian rule, any perceived opposition to the government was considered illegal and dealt with harshly. A number of unsuccessful plots were made by the [[CIA]] to remove Chiang from power and replace him with a more pliant and less authoritarian leader. Chiang for his part never fully trusted US intentions and was wary of excessively pro-American politicians.

Despite his advancing age and questionable mental state{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}, Chiang continued to hold onto power into the 1970s, maintaining to his dying day that he would live to rule over the mainland once again.

=== Democratic Reform ===

The Republic of China entered into the development phase of Constitutional Democracy with the promulgation of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] in 1947. Subsequently, the [[National Revolutionary Army]] was also renamed as [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] and was nationalized. However, due to the Chinese Civil War, the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]] was passed as amendment to the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]]. This established martial law in Taiwan and curtailed civil liberties and democracy. The official rationale for the Provisions was the ongoing Chinese Civil War and ROC was effectively under the military rule of the KMT during the [[Period of mobilization for the suppression of Communist rebellion|period of mobilization]]. Taiwan was effectively under martial law.

However, with the demise of the KMT single-party system and democratization movement during the 1980s, the martial law was eventually lifted in 1987 and provisions were eventually rescinded in 1991. [[Constitutional Democracy]] was eventually restored in ROC after 1987.

When the [[Republic of China]] relocated to Taiwan in 1949, the [[Chinese Youth Party]], [[China Democratic Socialist Party]], and KMT were the only legal political parties in Taiwan. The other established parties operated under the [[Tangwai movement]].

Until the early 1970s, the [[Republic of China]] was recognized as the sole legitimate government of China by the United Nations and most Western nations, refusing to recognize the People's Republic of China (PRC) on account of the Cold War. The KMT ruled Taiwan under martial law until the late 1980s, with the stated goal of being vigilant against Communist infiltration and preparing to retake mainland China. Therefore, political dissent was not tolerated.

The late 1970s and early 1980s were a turbulent time for the Taiwan-born as many of the people who had originally been oppressed and left behind by economic changes became members of the Taiwan's new middle class. Free enterprise had allowed native Taiwanese to gain a powerful bargaining chip in their demands for respect for their basic human rights. The [[Kaohsiung Incident]] would be a major turning point for democracy in Taiwan.

Taiwan also faced setbacks in the international sphere. In 1971, the ROC government walked out of the United Nations shortly before it recognized the PRC government in Beijing as the legitimate holder of China's seat in the United Nations. The ROC had been offered dual representation, but Chiang Kai-shek demanded to retain a seat on the UN Security Council, which was not acceptable to the PRC. Chiang expressed his decision in his famous "the sky is not big enough for two suns" speech. In October 1971, [[Resolution 2758]] was passed by the UN General Assembly and "the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek" (and thus the ROC) were expelled from the UN and replaced as "China" by the PRC. In 1979, the United States switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing.

[[Chiang Kai-shek]] died in April 1975 at the age of 87, and was succeeded to the presidency by [[Yen Chia-kan]] while his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] succeeded to the leadership of the Kuomintang (opting to take the title "Chairman" rather than the elder Chiang's title of "Director-General"). Formerly the head of the feared secret police, Chiang Ching-kuo recognized gaining foreign support to securing the ROC's future security required reform. His administration saw a gradual loosening of political controls, a transition towards democracy, and moves toward Taiwanization of the regime. Opponents of the Nationalists were no longer forbidden to hold meetings or publish papers. Though opposition political parties were still illegal, when the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] was established as the first opposition party in 1986, President Chiang decided against dissolving the group or persecuting its leaders. Its candidates officially ran in elections as independents in the [[Tangwai movement]]. In the following year, Chiang ended martial law and allowed family visits to mainland China.

Chiang selected [[Lee Teng-hui]], a Taiwan born technocrat to be his vice president, first in the line of succession to the presidency. The move followed other reforms giving more power to native born citizens and calmed anti-KMT sentiments during a period in which many other Asian autocracies were being shaken by.

After Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, his successor, President [[Lee Teng-hui]], continued to democratize the government. Lee transferred more government authority to Taiwanese born citizens, and Taiwan underwent a process of localization. In this localization process, local culture and history was promoted over a pan-China viewpoint. Lee's reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank instead of the usual Provincial Bank of Taiwan. He also largely suspended the operation of the [[Taiwan Provincial Government]]. In 1991 the [[Legislative Yuan]] and [[National Assembly]] elected in 1947 were forced to resign. These groups were originally created to represent mainland China constituencies. Also lifted were the restrictions on the use of Taiwanese languages in the broadcast media and in schools.

Attempting to maintain good relations with the PRC, Taiwan avoided any criticism of the [[Tiananmen Square Massacre]] and the media was largely barred from reporting on it. A group of students who attempted to sail a chartered ship into the Formosa Strait and beam pro-democracy broadcasts into China via amateur radio were foiled by the government by putting various obstacles in their way that caused them to abandon the attempt.

However, Lee failed to crack down on the massive corruption that pervaded the government and many KMT loyalists felt that Lee betrayed the ROC by taking reforms too far, while those in the opposition felt he did not take reforms far enough.

=== Democratic Period ===

Lee ran as the incumbent in Taiwan's first direct [[Republic of China presidential election, 1996|presidential election]] in 1996 against DPP candidate and former dissident, Peng Min-ming. This election prompted the PRC to conduct a series of missile tests in the [[Taiwan Strait]] to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate so that electorates would vote for other pro-unification candidates, Chen Li-an and Lin Yang-kang. The aggressive tactic prompted U.S. President Clinton to invoke the Taiwan Relations Act and dispatch two aircraft carrier battle groups into the region off Taiwan's southern coast to monitor the situation, and PRC's missile tests were forced to end earlier than planned. This incident is known as the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis|1996 Taiwan Straits Crisis]].

One of Lee's final acts as president was to declare on German radio that the ROC and the PRC have a special state to state relationship. Lee's statement was met with the PLA conducting military drills in Fujian and a frightening island-wide blackout in Taiwan, causing many to fear an attack.

The 2000 presidential election marked the end of the [[Kuomintang]]'s status as the ruling party. DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian won a three way race that saw the Pan-Blue vote split by independent James Soong (formerly of the Kuomintang) and Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan. Chen garnered 39% of the vote. After the election, Soong formed the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP).

In the [[Republic of China presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], [[Chen Shui-bian]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) was elected president with [[Annette Lu]] as vice-president. This was the first political party rotation in the history of the ROC.  The splitting of [[Kuomintang]] vote was what apparently led to this result. In August 2002, President Chen openly indicated that the [[Cross-strait relations|relationship between Taiwan and the mainland]] is "[[One Country on Each Side]]". This declaration led to disputations throughout [[Taiwan]], in [[mainland China]] and in the [[United States]]. In 2004, the day before the [[Republic of China presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], there was [[3-19 shooting incident|a supposed assassination attempt]] on President Chen and Vice-President Lu.  They were re-elected the next day, although the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] disputed the legality of the result due to the close margin of the election and the shooting incident. In 2005, an [[ad hoc]] [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] passed constitutional amendments ruling that elections for the [[Legislative Yuan]] change to use of [[parallel voting]], aiding the formation of a [[two-party system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://issue.udn.com/FOCUSNEWS/PARLIARMENT/b8.htm | author = Lin Hsin-huei (林新輝) | title = Constitutional Amendment, Kuomintang version, National Assembly Seats ad hoc (修憲國民黨版 國大定位任務型) | language = Chinese | date = 2000-04-08 | accessdate = 2007-06-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135313/http://issue.udn.com/FOCUSNEWS/PARLIARMENT/b8.htm | archivedate = 2011-07-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of scandals in the DPP administration, on 9 September 2006, former chairperson of the DPP, [[Shih Ming-teh]], led an anti-Chen Shui-bian campaign called the [[Million Voices Against Corruption, President Chen Must Go]] but did not achieve the desired result of President Chen's resignation. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The KMT also retained control of the legislature in the Legislative Yuan elections in January 2008. In the presidential election in May 2008, KMT candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] ran on a platform supporting friendlier relations with mainland China and economic reforms, and defeated DPP candidate Frank Hsieh with 58.48% of the vote.

Ma was re-elected, and the KMT retained its majority in the Legislative Yuan, in combined elections in January 2012. In the [[Taiwan general election, 2016|2016 elections]], the DPP regained power with [[Tsai Ing-wen]] becomes president.

On 24 May 2017, the [[Judicial Yuan|Constitutional Court]] ruled that same-sex couples have a right to marry, and gave the Legislature Yuan two years to adequately amend Taiwanese marriage laws. According to the court ruling, if amendments are not passed within two years, same-sex marriages will automatically become legal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-lgbt-marriage-idUSKBN18K0UN Taiwan court rules in favor of same-sex marriage, first in Asia ]&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, Taiwan (ROC) would become the first country in [[Asia]] and the first non-UN sovereign state to allow same-sex marriage.

At the end of 1943, the [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]] was issued, including among its clauses that all territories of China, including Formosa (Taiwan), that Japan had occupied would be returned to Republic of China.  This declaration was reiterated in the [[Potsdam Declaration]], issued in 1945.  Later that year, World War II ended, and Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, surrendering unconditionally.  The Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces commanded that the Japanese forces in Taiwan surrender to the government of the Republic of China, which acted as the representative of the Allied Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Congressional Record | date=1945-09-06 | url=http://www.taiwandocuments.org/surrender05.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021014090104/http://taiwandocuments.org/surrender05.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2002-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 25 October 1945 in [[Taipei Zhongshan Hall]], the Japanese government in Taiwan surrendered to the representative of the Republic of China, Chen Yi, the Republic of China formally receiving Taiwan.  In 1951, Japan formally signed the [[Treaty of San Francisco]], but, due to the unclear situation of the Chinese civil war, the peace treaty did not clearly indicate to whom Taiwan's sovereignty belonged.  In the second article of the 1952 [[Treaty of Taipei]], following the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan reiterated its abandonment of sovereignty of Taiwan, the Pescadores, the Spratlys and the Paracels.

The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) continued a state of war until 1979. In October 1949 a PRC attempt to take the ROC controlled island of [[Kinmen]] was thwarted in the [[Battle of Kuningtou]] halting the PLA advance towards Taiwan.&lt;ref name="QiB"&gt;Qi, Bangyuan.

In June 1949 the ROC declared a "closure" of all mainland China ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships. The closure covered from a point north of the mouth of [[Min River (Fujian)|Min river]] in [[Fujian province]] to the mouth of the [[Liao River|Liao river]] in Manchuria.&lt;ref name="Tsang"&gt;Tsang, Steve Yui-Sang Tsang.

Tauris. {{ISBN|1-85043-842-0}}. p 155, p 115-120, p 139-145&lt;/ref&gt; Since mainland China's railroad network was underdeveloped, north-south trade depended heavily on sea lanes. ROC naval activity also caused severe hardship for mainland China fishermen.

After losing mainland China, a group of approximately 12,000 KMT soldiers escaped to [[Burma]] and continued launching guerrilla attacks into south China. Their leader, General [[Li Mi (ROC general)|Li Mi]], was paid a salary by the ROC government and given the nominal title of Governor of [[Yunnan]]. Initially, the United States supported these remnants and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] provided them with aid. After the Burmese government appealed to the [[United Nations]] in 1953, the U.S. began pressuring the ROC to withdraw its loyalists. By the end of 1954, nearly 6,000 soldiers had left Burma and Li Mi declared his army disbanded. However, thousands remained, and the ROC continued to supply and command them, even secretly supplying reinforcements at times.

During the [[Korean War]], some captured Communist Chinese soldiers, many of whom were originally KMT soldiers, were repatriated to Taiwan rather than mainland China. A KMT guerrilla force continued to operate cross-border raids into south-western China in the early 1950s. The ROC government launched a number of air bombing raids into key coastal cities of mainland China such as [[Shanghai]].

Though viewed as a military liability by the United States, the ROC viewed its remaining islands in [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian]] as vital for any future campaign to defeat the PRC and retake mainland China. On 3 September 1954, the [[First Taiwan Strait crisis]] began when the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] started shelling [[Quemoy]] and threatened to take the [[Dachen Islands]].&lt;ref name="Tsang" /&gt; On 20 January 1955, the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] took nearby [[Yijiangshan Island]], with the entire ROC garrison of 720 troops killed or wounded defending the island. On January 24 of the same year, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Formosa Resolution]] authorizing the President to defend the ROC's offshore islands.&lt;ref name="Tsang" /&gt; The First Taiwan Straits crisis ended in March 1955 when the PLA ceased its bombardment. The crisis was brought to a close during the [[Asian-African Conference|Bandung conference]].&lt;ref name="Tsang" /&gt;

The [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]] began on 23 August 1958 with air and naval engagements between the PRC and the ROC military forces, leading to intense artillery bombardment of [[Quemoy]] (by the PRC) and [[Xiamen|Amoy]] (by the ROC), and ended on November of the same year.&lt;ref name="Tsang" /&gt; PLA patrol boats blockaded the islands from ROC supply ships. Though the United States rejected [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s proposal to bomb mainland China artillery batteries, it quickly moved to supply fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to the ROC. It also provided [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] ships to land supply, as a sunken ROC naval vessel was blocking the harbor. On September 7, the United States escorted a convoy of ROC supply ships and the PRC refrained from firing. On October 25, the PRC announced an "even-day ceasefire" &amp;mdash; the PLA would only shell Quemoy on odd-numbered days.

Despite the end of the hostilities, the two sides have never signed any agreement or treaty to officially end the war.

After the 1950s, the "war" became more symbolic than real, represented by on again, off again artillery bombardment towards and from [[Kinmen]]. In later years, live shells were replaced with propaganda sheets. The bombardment finally ceased in 1979 after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States.

During this period, movement of people and goods virtually ceased between PRC- and ROC-controlled territories. There were occasional defectors. One high-profile defector was [[Justin Yifu Lin]], who swam across the Kinmen strait to mainland China and is now Chief Economist and Senior Vice President of the [[World Bank]].

Most observers expected Chiang's government to eventually fall in response to a Communist invasion of Taiwan, and the United States initially showed no interest in supporting Chiang's government in its final stand. Things changed radically with the onset of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950. At this point, allowing a total Communist victory over Chiang became politically impossible in the United States, and President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] into the [[Taiwan strait]]s to prevent the ROC and PRC from attacking each other.&lt;ref name="BushR"&gt;Bush, Richard C. [2005] (2005). Untying the Knot: Making Peace in the Taiwan Strait. Brookings Institution Press. {{ISBN|0-8157-1288-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ROC complained to the [[United Nations]] against the [[Soviet Union]] supporting the PRC, the [[UN General Assembly Resolution 505]] was adopted on 1 February 1952 to condemn the Soviet Union.

In 1972, Japan and the Republic of China broke relations, declaring the Treaty of Taipei to be invalid.  At the same time, Japan and the People's Republic of China agreed to and signed the [[Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China]].

In 1987, the [[March 7 Incident]] ([[1987 Lieyu massacre|Lieyu massacre]]) in [[Lesser Kinmen]] cast a profound ripple on the cross-strait relation between China and Taiwan—4 months later on July 15, the [[Martial law in Taiwan]] was lifted; and 5 months later on December 15, the ROC government began to allow visits to mainland China. This benefited many, especially old KMT soldiers, who had been separated from their family in mainland China for decades. This also proved a catalyst for the thawing of relations between the two sides. Problems engendered by increased contact necessitated a mechanism for regular negotiations.

In order to effect negotiations with mainland China on operational issues without compromising the government's position on denying the other side's legitimacy, the ROC government under [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] created the "[[Straits Exchange Foundation]]" (SEF), a nominally non-governmental institution directly led by the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], an instrument of the [[Executive Yuan]]. The PRC responded to this initiative by setting up the [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] (ARATS), directly led by the [[Taiwan Affairs Office]] of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]].  This system, described as "white gloves", allowed the two governments to engage with each other on a semi-official basis without compromising their respective sovereignty policies.

Led by highly respected elder statesmen [[Koo Chen-fu]] and [[Wang Daohan]], the two organizations began a series of talks that culminated in the 1992 meetings, which, together with subsequent correspondence, established the [[1992 Consensus]], under which both sides agreed to deliberate ambiguity on questions of sovereignty, in order to engage on operational questions affecting both sides.

Also during this time, however, the rhetoric of ROC President [[Lee Tung-hui]] began to turn further towards Taiwan independence. Prior to the 1990s, the ROC had been a one-party authoritarian state committed to eventual reunification with mainland China.  However, with democratic reforms the attitudes of the general public began to influence policy in Taiwan. As a result, the ROC government shifted away from its commitment to the [[one China policy]] and towards a separate political identity for Taiwan. [[Jiang Zemin]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]], was also unwilling to compromise. Jiang notoriously attempted to influence the 1996 ROC election in Taiwan by conducting a missile exercise designed to intimidate Taiwanese voters and interfere with international shipping, leading to the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]]. By 1998, semi-official talks had broken down.

[[Chen Shui-bian]] was elected [[President of the Republic of China|President of the ROC]] in 2000.  Politically, Chen is pro-[[Taiwan independence]].  Chen's repudiation of the [[1992 Consensus]] combined with the PRC's insistence that the ROC agree to a [[One-China Policy|"one China" principle]] for negotiations to occur prevented improvement in cross-strait relations.

Up until the 1970s, the international community generally considered the Kuomintang on Taiwan to be the legal representative of China, but acknowledgment of the nation of the People's Republic of China slowly increased. In 1954, the Republic of China and the United States signed the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty|Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of China]]. In 1971, the United Nations acknowledged the People's Republic of China to be the sole legal representative of China ([[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]]). The KMT government strengthened their "[[Shu Han|Han]] and [[Cao Wei|the thief]] cannot both stand" ([[:zh:漢賊不兩立|漢賊不兩立]]) stance and announced withdrawal from the United Nations. After this, the international position of the Republic of China slid to a large extent. In 1979, when the United States broke relations, it created an even more severe attack on the diplomatic plight of the ROC. In recent years, the ROC government has tried several times to apply anew to enter international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization, but, under the opposing side's powerful obstruction, there has been no success.

The question of the political status of Taiwan or whether the two sides are moving toward unification or seeking ''de jure'' independence is still unresolved. The assertion of the People's Republic of China both domestically and internationally is "Whether from the perspective of history, government or international law, Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.   The political status of Taiwan is a Chinese domestic affair, and, under the premise of no hope for unification as well as certain other (conditions), (the Chinese government) does not abandon (the possibility of) the use of force to resolve it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue |author = The Taiwan Affairs Office and the Information Office of the State Council |url = http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&amp;title=White-Papers-On-Taiwan-Issue&amp;m_id=4 |accessdate = 2007-11-08 |authorlink = Taiwan Affairs Office |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090704234045/http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&amp;title=White-Papers-On-Taiwan-Issue&amp;m_id=4 |archivedate = 2009-07-04 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those persons promoting Taiwan independence feel that, because of the Treaty of San Francisco signed by Japan and the United States and the unclear indication of the handover of Taiwan's sovereignty (the status of Taiwan was not decided on), Taiwan's future direction should be decided upon by the people of Taiwan and that the People's Republic of China not be permitted to threaten the use of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Executive Summary |url = http://www.taiwandocuments.org/summary.htm |first = Charlie |last = Chi |publisher = Taiwan Documents Project |date = 2002-04-30 |accessdate = 2007-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2005, the [[National People's Congress]] of the People's Republic of China passed the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China|Anti-Secession Law]], making clear for the first time in legal form the [[One-China policy|One-China principle]].

== Economic growth ==
{{See also|Economic history of Taiwan}}

During the post-war period, Taiwan was lacking in goods and materials, the economy was depressed, and inflation was severe. After the national government moved to Taiwan, agriculture was first to grow, and, in 1953, Taiwan's economy returned to its pre-war level.  After this, the government pursued a policy of "Nurture industry with agriculture"(以農養工) on the foundation established during Japanese rule. With the capital, manpower, and skilled labor that was in Taiwan, American aid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADH500.pdf |title = U.S. overseas loans and grants: obligations and loan authorizations, 1 July 1945-30 September 2005 |author = U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) |accessdate=2007-11-07 |authorlink=United States Agency for International Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc., Taiwan's economy progressively moved toward rapid growth.  In the 1950s, the government carried out an [[Import substitution industrialization|import substitution]] policy, taking what was obtained by agriculture to give support to the industrial sector, trading agricultural product exports for foreign currency to import industrial machinery, thus developing the industrial sector.  The government raised tariffs, controlled foreign exchange and restricted imports in order to protect domestic industry.  By the 1960s, Taiwan's import exchange industry was faced with the problem of saturating the domestic market.  At the same time, the factories of some industrialized nations, because of rising wages and other reasons, slowly moved to certain areas that had both basic industry and low labor costs.  Consequently, the economic policy of Taiwan changed to pursue [[Export-oriented industrialization|export expansion]].  In 1960, the government enacted the "Regulations for Encouraging Investment," actively competing for foreign business investment in Taiwan. In 1966, the government established the Kaohsiung Export Processing Zone, Asia's first [[Free trade zone|export processing zone]], to expand the manufacturing production. In the role of a manufacturing relay station, Taiwan became a link in the international system of division of labor.  In 1963, the proportion of Taiwan's economy occupied by industry exceeded that of agriculture.  From 1968, Taiwan maintained two-digit long-term annual average economic growth up until the [[1973 oil crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Amsden, Alice H. |date = July 1979 |title = Taiwan's Economic History: A Case of Etatisme and a Challenge to Dependency Theory |journal = Modern China |volume = 5 |issue = 3 |pages = 341–380 |doi = 10.1177/009770047900500304 |url = http://mcx.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/5/3/341 |accessdate = 2007-11-06 |authorlink = Alice Amsden}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1971, Taiwan had a foreign trade surplus and continued from then on in an export state and a major producer of electronics goods.

The '''history of the [[Jews]] in [[Mumbai]]''' (previously known as '''Bombay'''), [[India]], began when Jews started settling in Bombay during the 18th century, due to its economic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Shalva. ''India's Jewish Heritage: Ritual, Art and Life-Cycle.'' Mumbai: Marg Publications. 2009 [first published in 2002; 3rd edn.].&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish community of Bombay consisted of the remnants of three distinct communities: the [[Bene Israel]]i Jews of [[Konkan]], the [[Baghdadi Jews]] of [[Iraq]], and the [[Cochin Jews]] of [[Malabar region|Malabar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Jewish Traveler|p=69|Ref=TheJewishTraveler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bombay is home to the majority of India's rapidly dwindling Jewish population. At its peak, in the late 1940s, the Jewish population of Bombay reached nearly 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Historic Community of Bombay, India | date = March 2008 | url = http://www.jewishtimesasia.org/bombay/264-bombay-communities/892-historic-community-of-bombay-india | work = Jewish Times Asia | accessdate = 2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the Sasoon family sponsored the emigration of Jews from Baghdad to Mumbai. In Mumbai they set up a Jewish school and a number of synagogues.

==Activities==

The [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]]&lt;ref name="TJPcrown" /&gt; runs a [[Jewish Community Center]] and has 500 members with classes on Hebrew and Judaism, holiday parties, youth discos and clubs for children and seniors.&lt;ref name="COL"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul |first=Ari |url=http://web.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/religion/2006/religions/judaism/index.htm |title=Israelis Invade India "Dikla Kadosh" May 17, 2006 |publisher=Web.jrn.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201064415/http://web.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/religion/2006/religions/judaism/index.htm |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is an "[[World ORT|ORT]]" (Organization for educational Resources and Technological training), an international Jewish organization with the mandate of helping impoverished Jews and which sells [[kosher wine]], [[challah]], chicken and baked goods.&lt;ref name="COL"/&gt;

Also, started in 2004 is the Hazon Eli Foundation for Jewish Life in [[India]], based in [[Thane]] (a suburb of Mumbai where many younger Jewish families are moving to), to teach Torah, Hebrew and Jewish law to the suburban population. A [[Sunday school]] is run there for children under 13, which attracts about 25 students weekly.&lt;ref name="COL"/&gt;

In Mumbai, there is also the Jewish founded "Sir Jacob Sassoon High School" and "Sir Elly Kadoorie High School".  Today there are only a handful of Jewish students left, but they once had Hebrew and Torah classes.&lt;ref name="COL"/&gt;

==Terrorist attacks on Mumbai==
{{main|November 2008 Mumbai attacks}}

Until the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks|terrorist attacks on Mumbai]] of November 2008, the Mumbai [[Chabad House]] Jewish outreach center was at [[Nariman House]], Hormusji Street. In the attack, six Jews were held hostage and murdered at the center, the 29-year-old Rabbi [[Gavriel Holtzberg]], his 28-year-old wife, [[Rivka Holtzberg|Rivka]], Rabbi Aryeh Leibish Teitelbaum (37), Bentzion Chroman (28), Yocheved Orpaz (62) and Norma Shvarzblat-Rabinovich (50). The parents of Rivka Holtzberg have announced their intention to continue Chabad's emissary work in Mumbai, although the Chabad House may move to a new location in the city mostly in South Mumbai near Worli. &lt;ref&gt;The Jerusalem Post, 2008-12-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communal relations==

Mumbai Jews' ties with their city's Muslim community have historically been strong and remain so even after the Mumbai attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Shalva. 2009'' India's Jewish Heritage: Ritual, Art and Life-Cycle'', Mumbai: Marg Publications [first published in 2002; 3rd edn.].&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups have been drawn together as minorities in a Hindu-dominated land – even by the similarities of their non-vegetarian diets of [[Kosher]] and [[Halal]] foods.&lt;ref name="timesonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5298367.ece |title=The Times &amp;#124; UK News, World News and Opinion |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "For these reasons, most Bene synagogues in Mumbai are in Muslim areas," Jonathan Solomon, chairman of the Indian Jewish Federation, said. Mumbai's Muslim Council had ordered that the nine gunmen killed should not be buried in the city, a gesture which was highly appreciated by the Mumbai Jewish community.&lt;ref name="timesonline1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3721">'''Ibrahim ibn Yaqub''' ({{floruit}} 961–62; sometimes ''Ibrâhîm ibn Ya`qûb al-Tartushi'' or ''al-Ṭurṭûshî''; also ''Abraham ben Jacob'') was a 10th-century [[al-Andalus|Hispano-Arabic]], [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] traveller, probably a merchant, who may have also engaged in diplomacy and espionage. His family hailed from Moorish-ruled [[Tortosa|Ṭurṭūšah]] (now Tortosa) close to the mouth of the [[Ebro]]: he may also have lived in [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordova]]. Written and oral history and his writings suggest that he had a Jewish background. However, it has also been argued by other historians that he was a Muslim of Jewish background, and [[Bernard Lewis]] states: "There is some uncertainty to whether he was a professing Jew or a Muslim of Jewish origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nizar F. Hermes|title=The [European] Other in Medieval Arabic Literature and Culture: Ninth-Twelfth Century AD|date=10 Apr 2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137081650|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;
__FORCETOC__
In 961–62 he travelled in [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] and in [[Italy]] at least as far as [[Rome]], where he was received with an audience with the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] during the first week of February.

Nothing is known about his return to '[[al-Andalus]]' (the Muslim-ruled part of the Iberian Peninsula), nor of any further travel. The memoirs and commentaries of his journey, possibly first presented to the Cordovan [[caliph]] [[Al-Hakam II]] (961–76), have been lost; only excerpts by later authors have been preserved, i.e., in [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri]]'s ''[[Book of Roads and Kingdoms (al-Bakrī)|Book of Highways and of Kingdoms]]''.

His work is widely known as providing the first reliable description of the [[Poland|Polish]] state under [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], the first historical ruler of Poland. He is also noted for his description of the [[Vikings]] living in [[Hedeby]], of the [[Nakonid]] fortification at [[Mecklenburg Castle]] and of what was, in all likelihood, the nucleus of the later ducal castle and palace at [[Schwerin]]. Ibrahim ibn Yaqub has a unique place in [[Czechs|Czech]] history as the first person to mention the city of [[Prague]] and its Jewish community in writing. He also mentioned Czech [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia]] and [[Krakow]] as part of [[Duchy of Bohemia]].

[[Image:Johan Ludvig Heiberg 1918.jpg|right|thumb|J. L. Heiberg in 1918]]

'''Johan Ludvig Heiberg''' (27 November 1854&amp;nbsp;– 4 January 1928) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[philologist]] and [[historian]]. He is best known for his discovery of previously unknown texts in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]], and for his edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' that [[T. L. Heath]] translated into English.  He also published an edition of [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy's]] ''[[Almagest]]''.

Heiberg was born in [[Aalborg]], the son of Johanne Henriette Jacoba (née Schmidt) and Emil Theodor Heiberg.&lt;ref&gt;http://genealogy.munthe.net/database/g0004629.html#I3348 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930194144/http://genealogy.munthe.net/database/g0004629.html |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heiberg was Professor of Classical Philology at the [[University of Copenhagen]] from 1896 until 1924. Among his more than 200 publications were editions of the works of [[Archimedes]] (1880 and 1912), [[Euclid]] (with [[Heinrich Menge]]) (1883–1916), [[Apollonius of Perga]] (1891–93), [[Serenus of Antinouplis]] (1896), [[Ptolemy]] (1898/1903), and [[Hero of Alexandria]] (1899). Many of his editions are still in use today.

The [[French Academy of Sciences]] awarded him the Prix Binoux for 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Séance du 16 décembre|journal=Le Moniteur scientifique du Doctor Quesneville|date=February 1913|page=135|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2557140;view=1up;seq=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His sister married biochemist [[Max Henius]].

==Archimedes Palimpsest==

Heiberg inspected the [[vellum]] manuscript in [[Constantinople]] in 1906, and realized that it contained mathematical works by [[Archimedes]] that were unknown to scholars at the time.

Heiberg's examination of the manuscript was with the naked eye only, while modern analysis of the texts has employed [[x-ray]] and [[ultraviolet light]]. The Archimedes Palimpsest is currently stored at the [[Walters Art Museum]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].

'''John Considine''' (September 29, 1868 – February 11, 1943) was an [[United States|American]] [[impresario]], a pioneer of [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|p=120 ''et. seq.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cullen|Hackman|2006|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth and arrival on the scene==
Born in [[Chicago]], Considine grew up attending [[Roman Catholic]] parochial schools, and eventually briefly attended [[St. Mary's College, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly a [[Chicago]] policeman, he was involved in the raid that led to the [[Haymarket Riot]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1901/06/26/archives/fatal-duel-in-seattle-john-considine-kills-exchief-of-police.html Fatal Duel in Seattle]", ''New York Times'', June 26, 1901, p. 3. Accessed online 22 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He then became a traveling actor, and landed in [[Seattle, Washington]] in 1889. By 1891, he was manager of the People's Theater, a [[box house]] in the wide-open "restricted district" below Yesler Way in what is now Seattle's [[Pioneer Square, Seattle, Washington|Pioneer Square]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Morgan120121&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=120–121}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A friendly, outgoing, but resolutely sober man in a rowdy environment, he dealt cards but did not play, made money off the sale of liquor but did not drink, managed a business whose profits depended on its female performers hustling drinks (and, in [[Murray Morgan]]'s words, "If the girls wished to peddle more personal wares, management did not object"), but was reputed to be a faithful family man.&lt;ref name=Morgan120121/&gt;

Considine decided that he could out-compete the other box houses by raising the level of entertainment, hiring professional actresses for the stage and letting other girls work the floor and the dark booths. He prospered greatly for a while, until he was brought down by the [[Panic of 1893]], the ensuing economic depression, and the 1894 election of an "anti-vice" administration in Seattle. He briefly attempted to run the People's as a proper theater; he ran a box house in [[Spokane, Washington]] before a similar anti-vice administration shut him down; and he returned to Seattle and lay relatively low until the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] (1897) brought back an "open town" administration. By February 1898 he had leased back the People's Theater, and was back in the business&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=121–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the rest of Seattle, "mining the miners."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/century/citz29.shtml Citizens help rig the bid]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', October 29, 1999.

== Rise to prominence ==

Considine brought [[variety entertainment]] in Seattle to a new level by importing [[Farida Mazar Spyropoulos]], famous as "[[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]]" from the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] (the Chicago [[World's Fair]] of 1893). The People's Theater (and its rivals) posted brass bands outdoors early in the evening to draw in customers. [[Salvation Army]] bands merely upped the level of chaos. Business was good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=124–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cullen|Hackman|2006|p=264}} mentions the Salvation Army bands.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considine also obtained an interest in a nearby saloon, Billy the Mug's at the corner of Second and Washington. He operated the rooms above it as the Owl Club Rooms, a gambling joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|1956|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established himself as a power in Seattle, "The Statesman", "The Boss Sport", [[ward heeler]] of the wide-open Fourth [[Ward (country subdivision)|Ward]]. He became a power in town, and was locally famous for his personal sobriety (his closest thing to a vice was [[chewing gum]]). His burly brother Tom and equally burly associate Doc Shaughnessy were known as his muscle and bodyguards. Shaughnessy, backed by Considine, started a [[physical culture]] institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflict with Wyatt Earp ===

Considine was not just big in entertainment: he was the city's gambling kingpin as well. In November 1899, [[Wyatt Earp]] left the Dexter Saloon in Nome, Alaska for about a year and went to Seattle, Washington, with a plan to open a saloon and gambling room. On November 25, 1899 the ''Seattle Star'' described him as "a man of great reputation among the toughs and criminals, inasmuch as he formerly walked the streets of a rough frontier mining town with big pistols stuck in his belt, spurs on his boots and a devil-may-care expression upon his official face". The ''[[Seattle Daily Times]]'' was less full of praise, announcing in a very small article that he had a reputation in Arizona as a "bad man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earp-in-seattle.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606215149/http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earp-in-seattle.htm |archivedate=June 6, 2012 |title=Wyatt Earp in Seattle|date= August 3, 2007|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He faced considerable opposition to his plan from Considine, who controlled all three gaming operations in town. Although gambling was illegal, Considine had worked out an agreement with Police Chief C.S. Reed. But Earp partnered with an established local gambler name Thomas Urguhart and they opened the Union Club saloon and gambling operation in Seattle's [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]]. The ''[[Seattle Star]]'' noted two weeks later that Earp's saloon was earning a large following. Considine unsuccessfully tried to intimidate Earp, but his saloon continued to prosper. On March 23, 1900, the state of Washington filed charges against several gamblers, including Earp and his partner. The club's furnishings were confiscated and burned. The Earps returned briefly to San Francisco in April 1900, but within a couple of months, Wyatt and Josephine returned to Oregon and caught the ''SS Alliance'' for Alaska.&lt;ref name=woog&gt;{{cite book |title=Wyatt Earp |last=Woog |first=Adam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_y9wsnur9R0C |publisher=Chelsea House Publications |date=February 28, 2010 |isbn=1-60413-597-2 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}} Considine continued as king of the Seattle gambling scene afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Pam Potter, [http://www.historynet.com/magazines/wild_west/8893497.html Wyatt Earp in Seattle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113105437/http://www.historynet.com/magazines/wild_west/8893497.html |date=2008-01-13 }}, ''Wild West'', HistoryNet.com. Accessed online 22 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facing off with the police chief==
As the gold rush era began to wane, the "open town" atmosphere again became a matter of controversy. A former employee of Considine's, William L. Meredith, who had followed Considine to Spokane, returned to his earlier job as a policeman. Meredith and Considine had slowly become enemies, and when Meredith became police chief he started an anti-vice campaign, which was really more of an anti-Considine campaign: he started to enforce laws against Considine's business, while leaving Considine's rivals alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|1956|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' lashed Meredith for not coming down hard enough on vice. An ambitious politician named John Wilson started a Law and Order League charging Meredith and Mayor [[Thomas J. Humes]] with a variety of offenses. The ''[[Seattle Times]]'' squared off in defense of Meredith and Humes, but the real duel was between Meredith and Considine. When Considine brought forth evidence that Meredith was corrupt, the ''P-I'' "played this testimony for as much as it was worth, perhaps more."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=131–133}} Quotation about the ''P-I'' is on p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matters escalated. Meredith accused Considine of an affair with Mamie Jenkins, a 17-year-old [[contortionist]] who performed at his theater, stating that she had become pregnant and that Meredith himself had paid for her abortion. This was almost certainly a slander: she appears to have ruptured herself while performing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|1956|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time the People's did not even have any closed boxes, but Meredith tried to shut it down under an anti-box-house ordinance, while letting actual box houses continue to operate. The city council decided to believe reports that Meredith was corrupt and his resignation was forced. Protesting a "[[star chamber]]" investigation, Meredith resigned. While Considine consulted with his lawyers about further action against Meredith, Meredith got hold of a double-barrelled 12-gauge [[shotgun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The shootout===
[[File:Seattle - G.O. Guy - 1900.jpg|thumb|G.O. Guy's drugstore, about a year before the shootout.]]
On the morning of Tuesday, June 25, 1901, Considine dropped by Meredith's lawyer's to inform them that if Meredith would not retract the claim about Mamie Jenkins, he was ready to sue for [[libel]]. He and his brother Tom wandered down from their (and the lawyer's) [[First Hill, Seattle, Washington|First Hill]] neighborhood. He dropped by the courthouse hoping to sort out his business's legal problems; the prosecuting attorney was out. At the courthouse, a friend warned him that Meredith was after him, and advised him to arm himself. He went about his day—shooting some pool with his brother, dropping by the office to read his mail, deciding to knock off early because of a sore throat. Forewarned, he picked up a .38 [[revolver]] that normally remained at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Meredith had acquired a virtual arsenal: besides the shotgun (which he had wrapped in butcher paper), he was carrying a .32 [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] in a .45 frame and a .38-caliber short-barreled revolver. He had also placed silver dollars strategically around his vest, presumably for armor. He spoke openly of the town "not being big enough" to hold both him and Considine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meredith waited at the corner of Yesler and Occidental, where he expected the Considines would go to catch the streetcar back up the hill. He spotted the Considines headed into [[G.O. Guy]]'s drugstore a block to the east, where John meant to pick up something for his throat. They were standing just outside the store talking with one Patrolman Merford, who Meredith had suspended, according to Gordon Newell "for pocketing part of a protection payment earmarked" for Meredith himself.&lt;ref name=Morgan137138&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newell"&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|1956|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meredith caught up to them just outside the store, took point-blank aim at John Considine with his shotgun, and missed. The dazed Considine staggered into the store; Tom Considine and Merford, were so taken aback that they hardly reacted at first; Meredith entered the store pursuing John Considine.&lt;ref name=Morgan137138/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newell" /&gt;

Meredith's next shot caught the back of Considine's neck, wounded the arm of a messenger boy drinking a [[Sarsaparilla (soft drink)|sarsaparilla]] at the [[soda fountain]], and nearly caught Dr. Guy, who hit the floor. Meredith dropped the shotgun and went for the revolver. Considine managed to grab Meredith in a bear hug and drag him toward the entrance, yelling out for help from his brother, who finally realized what was happening. Tom grabbed Meredith's gun and smashed it into Meredith's skull. More police arrived, including Sheriff Cudihee. Tom grabbed one of their guns and drew down on them, yelling "Stand back, you sons of bitches!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|1956|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, John Considine drew his gun on Meredith, who was clearly wounded, but still moving. Considine shot Meredith three times in the chest and neck, killing him, then handed his gun to Sheriff Cudihee and surrendered himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The trial===
While Meredith had always been part of the "open town" faction, his death made him a martyr for the "closed town" side. At the Considines' trial, the prosecution tried to make the case that the Considines had started the gunfight; however, Meredith's outspoken statements in the 24 hours before the fight (including "They couldn't get a jury in [[King County, Washington|King County]] that would convict me for killing Considine") helped to clarify any confusion as to what happened, as did the testimony of the best-situated eyewitnesses. The jury took only three hours to reach an acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=139–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Respectability==
Considine soon reinvented himself as a respectable impresario north of the Yesler Way "Deadline". In 1902, he bought into Seattle's first well-appointed movie theater (Edison's Unique Theater,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berner|1991|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; established 1897), partnering with the local distributor of [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] [[phonograph record]]s, creating Seattle's first establishment to combine variety entertainment with movies and Considine's first "dry" establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=142–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficulty in obtaining first-rate acts to play a city so distant from the major concentrations of North American population led Considine to establish one of the first vaudeville [[circuit (theater)|circuits]] (quite possibly the very first), with theaters in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]], and [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] as well as Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the world's first popularly priced vaudeville chain, with ten- and twenty-cent admissions.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Elliott, paraphrased at {{Harvnb|Berner|1991|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considine soon cut (or played down) his old ties to the "restricted district". He played a major role in one of the country's rising [[fraternal organization]]s: just before the turn of the century he and [[John Cort (Cort Circuit)|John Cort]], whose career followed a similar trajectory, had founded the Independent Order of Good Things, which soon became the [[Fraternal Order of Eagles]] (F.O.E.). A third founder, [[H. L. Leavitt]], soon bolted to the [[Loyal Order of Moose]]. In [[New York City]] in 1906 on F.O.E. business, he met and teamed up with [[Tammany Hall|Tammany]] boss [[Timothy Sullivan|Big Tim Sullivan]] to form the Sullivan–Considine vaudeville circuit and associated nationwide [[booking agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; At it peak, the Sullivan–Considine circuit owned 20 theaters in the Pacific Northwest and was affiliated with 20 in California; they also booked numerous theaters in the Midwest.&lt;ref name="Berner"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berner|1991|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Considine and Cort had always been the friendliest of rivals, Considine's rivalry with another Seattle-based vaudeville impresario, [[Alexander Pantages]], ran more to stealing each other's acts (or, failing that, literally stealing the acts' equipment). Still, they too maintained a cordial personal relationship. Their rivalry took place both on their home turf and on the national scene. Murray Morgan characterizes their rivalry as that between a well-connected, savvy businessman (Considine) and a hardworking uneducated genius (Pantages).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=146–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pantages simply had a better instinct than Considine for what the public would pay to see, and his total contempt for efforts to "uplift" public taste—and, especially for efforts to impose New York tastes on the country at large—turned out to make good business sense. When Tim Sullivan went insane in 1913, Considine lost one of his main sources of clout and connections. By 1914, Pantages had clearly won out. Considine tried selling out to [[Marcus Loew]] (whose eastern-U.S.-based circuit had been allied with the western based Sullivan-Considine circuit since 1911&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cullen|Hackman|2006|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;); the deal ultimately fell apart, but a forfeited down payment gave Considine quite an infusion of cash. Still, with [[World War I]] clobbering access to international stars, Considine's circuit fell apart, and Pantages bought up the pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|pp=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1915/10/30/archives/john-considine-in-court-theatrical-man-says-he-owes-800000-and-cant.html John Considine in Court], ''New York Times'', October 30, 1915, p. 10. Accessed online 22 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

All concerned eventually moved to [[Los Angeles]], which by then had firmly established itself as the West Coast entertainment capital. Considine gained a foothold in the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|1960|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; son, film producer [[John Considine, Jr.]] ([[Puttin' on the Ritz#1930 film|''Puttin' on the Ritz'']], 1930; [[Boys Town (film)|''Boys Town'']], 1938), married Pantages' daughter Carmen;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cullen|Hackman|2006|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; their sons, [[John Considine (actor)|John]] and [[Tim Considine|Tim]] became successful movie and television actors.&lt;ref&gt;His nephew [[Bob Considine|Bob]] became a political reporter and newspaper columnist; another [http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/174273_tf221.html?searchpagefrom=1&amp;;searchdiff=350 Actor John Considine to speak at Port Townsend Film Festival], ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', May 21, 2004.

==The Orpheum (1911)==
[[File:Seattle - Moore Theatre - Orpheum poster 01 - A.jpg|thumb|A poster for a post-1916 Orpheum program at the Moore Theatre.]]
From 1911, the flagship of Considine's chain was the Orpheum Theatre at 3rd Avenue and Madison Street in Seattle. Designed by [[William Kingsley]], the $500,000 theater was constructed, insofar as possible, with materials and services obtained from within Washington state. The decorative wrought iron canopy extending from over the box office to the curb out became "a fixture of the 3rd Avenue landscape"; the lavish interior was "awash in marble, onyx, and glass."&lt;ref name=Flom&gt;Eric Flom, [http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=4247 Seattle's Orpheum Theatre opens at 3rd Avenue and Madison Street on May 15, 1911], September 30, 2003.

Although the Orpheum was touted at the time of its 5 May 1911 opening as "America's most luxurious theater," after 1916 it no longer was even the grandest vaudeville theater in the neighborhood: Alexander Pantages opened an even larger and more opulent theater several blocks north at 3rd Avenue and University Street. The Orpheum vaudeville shows moved to the larger [[Moore Theatre (Seattle)|Moore Theatre]], although the Orpheum continued to operate for many years, variously showing live shows and movies;&lt;ref name=Flom /&gt; it was renamed as the President Theatre.&lt;ref name=Flom-2&gt;Eric Flom [http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=4260 New Orpheum Theatre opens in Seattle on August 28, 1927], HistoryLink, November 22, 2003. Accessed January 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last years before it was torn down in 1949, it was used merely as a storage facility.&lt;ref name=Flom /&gt;

This Orpheum was not Seattle's only theater by this name; indeed, it was Considine's third theater by this name in Seattle. The first had been one of Considine's first vaudeville theaters; the second was a renaming of Martin Beck's Coliseum Theater&lt;ref name="Berner" /&gt; (no relation to the surviving 1917 Coliseum theater building, designed by [[B. Marcus Priteca]] for Pantages).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pstos.org/history/priteca.htm B. Marcus Priteca], Puget Sound Theatre Organ Society.

'''Jorge Basadre Grohmann''' (February 12, 1903&amp;nbsp;– June 29, 1980) was a [[Peru]]vian [[historian]] known for his extensive publications about the independent history of his country. He served during two different administrations as [[Ministry of Education (Peru)|Minister of Education]] and was also director of the [[Biblioteca Nacional del Perú|Peruvian National Library]].

==Early life==
Jorge Basadre was born to Carlos Basadre Forero and Olga Grohmann Pividal in [[Tacna]], which was then under [[Chile]]an occupation. He started his education in the Saint Rose Lyceum of Tacna in 1908 but changed to the [[German School of Lima]] when his family moved to this city in 1912. He undertook his final year of secondary education at Our Lady of Guadalupe National School in 1918.

In 1919, Basadre entered the [[National University of San Marcos]] where he graduated as a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Humanities]] in 1928 and in [[Law]] in 1935. While studying, he also worked at the [[Biblioteca Nacional del Perú|Peruvian National Library]] from 1919 up to 1930. He undertook postgraduate studies in the United States, Germany and Spain between 1931 and 1935.

==Public life==
Back in Peru, Basadre became director of the Central Library at San Marcos University, which he reorganized between 1936 and 1942. After a fire in the Peruvian National Library on May 9, 1943, Basadre was named its director and put in charge of its reconstruction. His work here included rebuilding the book collection and organizing the publishing of the Library magazine, ''Fénix''. For a short period in 1945 he was named [[Ministry of Education (Peru)|Minister of Education]] by president [[José Luis Bustamante y Rivero]]. He was elected to the presidency of the ''Instituto Histórico del Perú'' (Historic Institute of Peru) for the period 1956-1962. Peruvian president [[Manuel Prado Ugarteche]] named him Minister of Education a second time in 1956, a post he held until his resignation in 1958.

==Publications==
Basadre was a prolific writer; his numerous works on the history of Peru in the 19th and 20th centuries are still a benchmark for historians interested in this period. His publications include ''La multitud, la ciudad y el campo'' (1929), ''La iniciación de la República'' (1929-1930), ''Perú, problema y posibilidad'' (1931), ''La promesa de la vida peruana'' (1943), ''El conde de Lemos y su tiempo'' (1945), ''Chile, Perú y Bolivia independientes'' (1948), ''El azar en la historia y sus límites'' (1971), ''La vida y la historia'' (1975) and ''Elecciones y centralismo en el Perú'' (1980). However, his most important work is his ''Historia de la República'' (History of the Republic), first published as a single volume in 1939. It grew in size with every new edition until reaching sixteen volumes in the 6th edition of 1968. By that time it covered with rigorous detail Peruvian history from [[Peruvian War of Independence|Independence]] in 1821 until the death of president [[Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro]] in 1933. Basadre supplemented his History of the Republic with the publication of ''Introducción a las bases documentales para la Historia de la República del Perú'' in 1971 a thorough review of [[primary sources]] about the republican history of Peru.

==Death and Legacy==
Jorge Basadre died on June 29, 1980, in the city of [[Lima]] at the age of 77. A Peruvian University is named after him, [[Jorge Basadre Grohmann National University]] in [[Tacna]]. Since 1991, when the [[nuevo sol]] became the official currency of Peru, his portrait has appeared on the S/ 100 banknote.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8552">'''Juan Bautista Muñoz''' ([[Museros]], 12 June 1745 &amp;ndash; Valencia, 1799) was an 18th-century [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher and historian.

== Biography ==

Born in [[Museros]] (near [[Valencia]]) in 1745, Juan Bautista Muñoz was the third of four sons.&lt;ref name = Bas&gt;Bas Martín, Nicolás  (2002) ''El cosmógrafo e historiador Juan Bautista Muñoz, 1745-1799''.  Valencia: Universitat de Valencia.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the death of his father in 1751, his mother placed him under the tutelage of his uncle, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar Gabriel Ferrandis at the convent of [[Pilar de Valencia]], where he began to receive his first formal education.  From 1753 to 1757, Muñoz was enrolled at the [[Jesuit]] [[seminary]] in Valencia, where he came under the influence of the polymath Antonio Eximeno Pujades, and began to take an interest in mathematics and modern philosophy.

=== Academic at Valencia ===

From 1757 to 1770, Juan Bautista Muñoz was at the [[University of Valencia]], initially as a student, then as a teacher. He received his master of arts and bachelor in philosophy in 1760, and a doctorate in theology by 1765. Imbibing the spirit of the [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]], Muñoz made a name for himself at the university as an opponent of [[Scholasticism]] and a reformer of the curriculum towards more modern topics.&lt;ref name = Bas/&gt; In his eclectic philosophical treatise, ''De recto philosophiae recentis in theologiae usu dissertatio'' (1767), Muñoz laid out the case for the usefulness of modern philosophy and [[natural theology]] to traditional theology. He promoted the introduction of the works of [[François Jacquier]] and [[Luis António Verney]] in the curriculum.  During this period, Muñoz also undertook the labors of editing the works of [[Louis of Granada]], which came out in several volumes between 1765 and 1775.

As a Dominican and a modernist,  Muñoz's career profited from the royal edict of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] of 1767 [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expelling the Jesuits]] from Spain.  After a brief sojourn in Rome in 1768, Muñoz was appointed to the chair of philosophy at Valencia in 1769.

=== Cosmographer-major ===

On October 28, 1770, at the age of twenty-five, Juan Bautista Muñoz was appointed ''Cosmografo mayor de Indias'' ([[cosmographer]]-major of the Indies) by King [[Charles III of Spain]]. He resigned his chair at Valencia and moved to [[Madrid]] to take up his office.  The position, created in 1571, had become ill-defined by this time, the Spanish navy had already absconded with most of its scientific functions, and urged the abolition of the post. Muñoz tried to redefine the post, partitioning some of the functions with the naval academy. Despite his efforts, the post was formally abolished by royal edict in 1783, although Muñoz continued to use the title down to his death 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Bas Martín (2002: p.64)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this capacity as cosmographer-major that Muñoz began to delve more deeply into history. In the course of the composition of the geographical and navigational reports and memoirs he submitted to the [[Consejo de Indias]], Muñoz frequently had to resort to examining the historical documentary record of [[Spanish America]].&lt;ref&gt;For a list of his memoirs, see Bas Martín (2002: p.63)&lt;/ref&gt; While in Madrid, he also participated in the educational reform movement launched by Charles III, putting out a treatise on the matter in 1778 (''Juicio del tratado de educacion de Pozzi'').&lt;ref&gt;Bas Martín (2002: p.72)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of the New World ===

In the late 18th century, published Spanish histories of the Indies were in an out-of-date state.  The first draft had been composed by [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] in his ''Decadas'' (1511–25), which were supplemented shortly after by a [[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies|small 1552 tract]] by [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] and the first part of the ''Historia'' (1535) of [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]] (the rest of Las Casas and Oviedo would only appear in the 19th century; the life of Columbus by his son [[Ferdinand Columbus]], only existed in an Italian edition (1571) at the time). The first comprehensive Spanish history of the Indies had been [[Francisco López de Gómara]]'s ''Hispania Victrix'' (1552).  The last great history had been [[Antonio Herrera]]'s ''Historia general'' (1601–15).  Although partial histories had been written since, Herrera's treatise, nearly two-centuries old, remained effectively the last general work on the matter until Muñoz's time.

Foreign writers had weighed in with their own accounts. The most recent and significant had been the ''History of America'' by the Scottish historian [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] which began to appear in 1777. Robertson's history, in the modern Enlightenment tradition and historical methodology, was initially well received.  But the outbreak of the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1779)]] had suspended the further appearance of Robertson's work in Spain, and encouraged the Spanish establishment to come up with their own up-dated modernized history.

On July 17, 1779, Charles III formally placed Muñoz with the responsibility of writing a comprehensive history of the Spanish conquest and colonization of the Americas, in an effort to set the record straight, snuff out various apocryphal stories and ''[[leyenda negra]]'' rumors circulating throughout Europe and defend Spanish territorial rights in America from the encroaching claims of other European powers. Muñoz set about collecting and examining documentary material scattered in various archives throughout Spain and Portugal, with the objective of turning his history into an objective reference work.

In 1784, Muñoz moved to [[Seville]], where he had available the archives of the [[Casa de Contratación]] and the [[Biblioteca Colombina]] at the [[cathedral of Seville]] (the depository library collected by [[Ferdinand Columbus]] in the early 16th century, and deposited at the cathedral after his death in 1539). Seeing the value of having all the Indies-related documents collected in one place, in 1785, Charles III ordered the establishment of the [[General Archive of the Indies|Archivo General de Indias]] at Casa Lonja in Seville and issued orders to other archives to deliver Indies-related documents.  The project was under the direction of [[José de Gálvez]], who worked closely with Muñoz in collecting, sifting and cataloging the incoming documents. The archives of the Consejo de Indias, the royal archives of [[Simancas]], the Casa de Contratacion's archives in Cadiz and the archives of the Secretaria de Estado y del Despacho de Indias were the principal feeders of the new Archivo General.

The first volume of Juan Bautista Muñoz's ''Historia del Nuevo Mundo'' appeared in 1793.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6382">'''Mark Klempner''' is a [[folklore|folklorist]], [[oral history|oral historian]] and [[Pundit (expert)|social commentator]].

==Early life==
Klempner grew up in [[New York City]], and attended [[Cornell University]], graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1997, and winning a J. William [[Fulbright Fellowship]]. In 2000, he received an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in folklore from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

==''The Heart Has Reasons''==
Klempner spent nearly a decade talking with and getting to know Dutch "[[Righteous Gentiles|Righteous Among the Nations]]" in order to write ''The Heart Has Reasons: Holocaust Rescuers and Their Stories of Courage'', Cleveland: The Pilgrim Press, 2006.  He found the rescuers through [[Yad Vashem]], and was originally funded by a research grant from the Institute for European Studies at [[Cornell University]]. Most of the rescuers he interviewed were previously unknown to the general public, with the exception of [[Miep Gies]], who tried to save [[Anne Frank]] and her family. Because Klempner is the son of a Jewish immigrant who barely escaped the [[Holocaust]], he found that his subjects sometimes looked at him as the child or grandchild of the Jews they rescued. He later conducted archival research at The [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] and The [[Netherlands Institute for War Documentation]]. The published book contains a foreword by renowned Holocaust historian [[Christopher Browning]]. In Spring of 2012, Klempner addressed members of the [[United States Congress]] and their Staffs on the occasion of Holocaust Remembrance Day ([[Yom HaShoah]]).&lt;ref&gt;{Mr. Klempner Goes to Washington web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-klempner/standing-with-obama-over-_b_268040.html |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spoke at the Library of Congress and a [https://www.loc.gov/today/cyberlc/feature_wdesc.php?rec=5548 webcast is now available] containing his speech.

On November 15, 2012, an updated paperback edition of The Heart Has Reasons was published by Night Stand Books with the {{ISBN|0988567407}}. The subtitle has changed from "Holocaust Rescuers and Their Stories of Courage" to "Dutch Rescuers of Jewish Children during the Holocaust." The author notes that this second edition contains 12 new photographs, improvements in the text, and an updated epilogue.

==Historical, social, political, and cultural commentary==
Klempner's articles on oral history methodology have appeared internationally in professional journals and anthologies such as ''[[The Oral History Reader]]''.  He has also been a guest [[columnist]] for mainstream periodicals such as the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' and the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' as well as progressive religious periodicals like the  ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'' and ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]''.  His [[editorial|op-eds]] often tackle difficult political and social issues, such as his piece "The Internet: Our Last Hope for a Free Press," which has received more than 1,000 [[Digg]]s.

'''Marxist literary criticism''' is a loose term describing [[literary criticism]] based on socialist and dialectic theories. Marxist criticism views literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate. (Clarification: In fact, most Marxist critics who were writing in what could chronologically be specified as the early period of Marxist literary criticism subscribed to what has come to be called "[[Vulgar Marxism]]." In this thinking of the structure of societies, literary texts are one register of the Superstructure, which is determined by the economic Base of any given society. Therefore, literary texts are a reflection of the economic Base rather than "the social institutions from which they originate" for all social institutions, or, more precisely human social relationships, are in the final analysis determined by the economic Base). According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author.  

The English literary critic and cultural theorist, [[Terry Eagleton]], defines Marxist criticism this way:

: Marxist criticism is not merely a 'sociology of literature', concerned with how novels get published and whether they mention the working class. Its aim is to explain the literary work more fully; and this means a sensitive attention to its forms, styles and, meanings. But it also means grasping those forms, styles and meanings as the product of a particular history.&lt;ref&gt;T Eagleton, Marxism and Literary Criticism, Berkeley, U of California P, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest goals of Marxist literary criticism can include an assessment of the political 'tendency' of a literary work, determining whether its social content or its literary form are 'progressive'. It also includes analyzing the class constructs demonstrated in the literature. Further, another of the ends of Marxist criticism is to analyze the narrative of class struggle in a given text. Does the text serve to perpetuate the ruling class ideology; to subvert that ideology, such as William Morris's ''News from Nowhere''; or to signify both a perpetuation and subversion of the dominant ideology, such as in the works of Charles Dickens with ''Hard Times'' being the novel that most openly textualizes such a double signification as it offers a damning criticism of capitalism while also and at the same time seeking a perpetuation of a class-structured society.

== History ==
[[Karl Marx]]'s studies have provided a basis for much in socialist theory and research. Marxism aims to revolutionize the concept of work through creating a [[classless society]] built on control and ownership of the means of production. In such a society, the means of production (the Base in the architectural metaphor Marx uses to analyze and describe the structure of any given society in written human history) are possessed in common by all people rather than being owned by an elite ruling class.  Marx believed that Economic Determinism, Dialectical Materialism and Class Struggle were the three principles that explained his theories. (Clarification: Though Marx does attribute a teleological function to the economic, he is no determinist. As he and Engels write in ''The Communist Manifesto'', the class struggle in its capitalist phase could well end "in the common ruin of the contending classes,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Communist Manifesto|last=Marx|first=Karl, and Friedrich Engels|publisher=Norton|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as Terry Eagleton argues in ''Why Marx Was Right,'' "Capitalism can be used to build socialism, but there is no sense in which the whole historical process is secretly labouring towards this goal")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why Marx Was Right|last=Eagleton|first=Terry|publisher=Yale UP|year=2011|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bourgeoisie (Dominant class who control and own the means of production) and Proletariat (Subordinate class: the ones who do not own and control the means of production) were the only two classes who engaged in hostile interaction to achieve class consciousness. (Clarification: In Marx's thought, it is only the proletariat, the working class, that must achieve class consciousness. The bourgeoisie is already quite well aware of its position and power in the capitalist paradigm. As individuals, workers know that they are being exploited in order to produce [[surplus value]] (value produced by the worker that is appropriated by the capitalists); however, the working class must realize that they are being exploited not only as individuals but as a class. It is upon this realization that the working class reaches [[class consciousness]]).  Marx believed that all past history is a struggle between hostile and competing economic classes in state of change.  Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] collaborated to produce a range of publications based on capitalism, class struggles and socialist movements.

These theories and ideologies can be found within three published works: 
* ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' 
* [[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|''Preface to the Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'']] (1859)
* ''[[Das Kapital]]'' or ''Capital'' (1867)

The first publication ''Communist Manifesto'' (1848) argues that ‘the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle’.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted Marx – W Duiker &amp; J Spielvogel, The Essential World History, vol, II: since 1500, 3rd ed, Thomson Higher Education, Belmont, 2008, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt;  As class struggle is the engine room of history, to understand the course of history, one must analyse the class relations that typify different historical epochs, the antagonisms and forms of class struggle embodied in such class relations. This involves the development of class consciousness and follows the revolutionary movements that challenge the dominant classes. It extends to rating the success of these revolutions in developing new modes of production and forms of social organization.&lt;ref&gt;D Mclellan, The Thought of Karl Marx, Macmillan Press, London, 1971, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  

In contrast to the ''Manifesto'', ''Preface to the Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' (1859) and ''Capital'' (1867) focus on the unfolding logic of a system, rather than class struggle. These provide an alternative account of historical development and emphasize the self-destructive contradictions and law of motion of specific modes of production.&lt;ref&gt;R Stones, Key Sociological Thinkers, Macmillan Press, London, 1998, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Preface'' argues that society’s economic organization consists of a distinctive pattern of forces and relations of productions. From this foundation arises a complex political and ideological superstructure,&lt;ref&gt;D Mclellan, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;  where economic development impacts upon societal progress.  

''Capital'' was more concerned with the genesis and dynamic of capitalism. As Mclellan (1971) states, ‘it refers to class struggle mainly in the context of the struggle between capital and labour, within capitalism, rather than over its suppression’.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in D Mclellan, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Capital'' was less concerned with forecasting how capitalism would be overthrown, than considering how it had developed and how it functioned.&lt;ref&gt;I McIntosh, Classical Sociological Theory: A Reader, Edinburgh University Press, Great Britain, 1997, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The key to understanding this logic was the ‘commodity’ form of social relations – a form that was most fully developed only in capitalism.

== Ideologies ==
It is through the theories of class struggle, politics and economics that Marxist literary criticism emerged. The thought behind Marxist Criticism is that works of literature are mere products of history that can be analyzed by looking at the social and material conditions in which they were constructed.&lt;ref&gt;K Siegel, ‘Introduction to Modern Literary Theory’, viewed 15 March 2011, http://www.kristisiegel.com/theory.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Marx’s ''Capital'' states that 'the mode of production of material life determines altogether the social, political, and intellectual life process. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but on the contrary their social being, that determines their consciousness.' Put simply, the social situation of the author determines the types of characters that will develop, the political ideas displayed and the economical statements developed in the text.

== The development of Marxist criticism ==
Although Marx and Friedrich Engels detailed theories of socialism in the mid-nineteenth century, it was not until the 1920s that Marxist literary theory was systematized. The greatest impetus for this standardization came after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 in Russia. The event instigated a change in belief around socialist ideals in government and society.&lt;ref&gt;K Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;   While these ideals developed, [[socialist realism]] was accepted as the highest form of literature – a theory based on an art movement that depicted and glorified the proletariat's struggle towards societal progress. These ideas guided both literary creation and official literary criticism in the Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;K Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;  where works focused on the lives of the different classes. In the years since then, the beliefs of some Marxist schools regarding literary theory have been modified to acknowledge that literary creation is a result of both subjective inspiration and the objective influence of the writer's surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;K Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;  This system of belief relies on the social classes as well as the economic and political development of society. Thus, Marx’s theories intertwined with the emerging ideologies of the new Russian movement and spread throughout the world.

== Writers influenced by Marxist criticism ==
In addition to being the guiding principle behind most literary works in Soviet Russia, Marxism also greatly influenced many Western writers. [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Claude McKay]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], and [[Bertold Brecht]] were deeply influenced by Marxist and socialist theories of the day, and much of this type of reflection is evident in their writings of the time.&lt;ref&gt;K Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Medical Renaissance''', from 1400 to 1700 CE, is the period of progress in European [[medical]] knowledge, and a renewed interest in the ideas of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Such medical discoveries during the '''Medical Renaissance''' are credited with paving the way for modern medicine.

== Background ==
[[Image:De re anatomica libri 15 V00044 00000004.tif|thumb|''De Re Anatomica'' by [[Realdo Colombo]], 1572]]

The Medical Renaissance began just as the original [[Renaissance]] did, in the early 1400s. Medical researchers continued their Renaissance-evoked practices into the late 1600s. Florence, Italy was credited by most historians for being an influential hub for medical research and communications of proven advancements in the field of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-01-01|title=Medical Renaissance in Florence|journal=European Journal of General Practice|volume=12|issue=2|pages=51|doi=10.1080/13814780600940767|pmid=16945876|issn=1381-4788|last1=Bradley|first1=C.

[[Thomas Linacre| Linacre]], [[Erasmus]], Leonicello and [[Jacques Dubois| Sylvius]] are among the list of the first scholars most credited for the starting of the Medical Renaissance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following after is [[Andreas Vesalius]]'s publication of [[De humani corporis fabrica]] (On the Fabric of the Human body) in 1543.  Better knowledge of the original writings of [[Galen]] in particular, developed into the [[learned medicine]] tradition through the more open attitudes of [[Renaissance humanism]]. Church control of the teachings of the medical profession and universities diminished, and [[dissection#Christian Europe|dissection]] was more often possible.

== Medical Procedures on the Deceased ==
The development of [[autopsy]] allowed society to use it for [[Forensic science|forensic]] and health purposes. In the early 1300s, Italian cities established a group of doctors to assist in investigating the cause of death in murder trials. In 1302, the death of [[Azzolino degli Onesti]] was investigated because it was suspected that he was poisoned. From the surgeon’s examination, they concluded that the cause of death was from a large amount of blood that gathered around the [[chilic vein]] and the veins of the liver.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Katherine|year=1994|title=The criminal and the saintly body: Autopsy and dissection in Renaissance Italy|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/222400145|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctors began doing autopsies on their private patients during the fifteenth century. In 1486, the Florentine patrician, [[Bartolomea Rinieri,]] was autopsied at her request so that her daughter could be treated for what caused her death. The surgeons discovered a diseased womb that had hardened. High-class members of society could request their own postmortem because they had the financial means.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Craniotomy|Craniotomies]] were also used by surgeons to find the cause of death. This practice dates back to the [[13th century|thirteenth century]]. The [[House of Medici|Medicis]], a powerful family in [[Florence]] during the Renaissance, had skulls that revealed craniotomies and autopsies had been performed. The procedure was also done on illegitimate members of the family and children. Every skeleton of the Medici family shows signs of [[embalming]], a practice only done for the elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The fine arts, neurology, and neuroscience : history and modern perspectives : neuro-historical dimensions|last=Lanska|first=Douglas|publisher=ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV|year=|isbn=978-0-444-62730-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surgeons of the era were also categorized as a [[class system]]. They were acknowledged as master surgeons, “surgeons of the long robe,” or the lower class of [[barber surgeon]]s, “surgeons of the short robe”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giuffra|first=Valentina|year=2016|title=Autoptic practices in 16th-18th century Florence: Skeletal evidences from the Medici family|journal=International Journal of Paleopathology|volume=15|pages=21–30|doi=10.1016/j.ijpp.2016.09.004|pmid=29539551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Leonardo da Vinci}}
[[Image:Leonardo da Vinci Studies of Embryos.jpg|right|thumb|This drawing by Leonardo da Vinci of a foetus in the womb is one of many detailed anatomical drawings by the artist]]

Leonardo da Vinci made many contributions in the fields of science and technology. His research centered around his desire to learn more about how the human brain processes visual and sensory information and how that connects to the soul. Though his artwork was widely observed before, some of his original research was not made public until the 20th century. Some of da Vinci's research involved studying [[Visual perception|vision]]. He believed that visual information entered the body through the eye, then continued by sending nerve impulses through the [[optic nerve]], and eventually reaching the soul. Da Vinci subscribed to the ancient notion that the soul was housed in the brain. He did research on the role of the [[spinal cord]] in humans by studying frogs. He noted that as soon as the frogs medulla of the spine is broken, the frog would die. This led him to believe that the spine is the basis for the sense of touch, cause of movement, and the origin of nerves. As a result of his studies on the spinal cord, he also came to the conclusion that all peripheral nerves begin from the spinal cord. Da Vinci also did some research on the sense of smell. He is credited with being the first to define the olfactory nerve as one of the cranial nerves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pevsner|first=Jonathan|year=2002|title=Leonardo da Vinci's contributions to neuroscience|doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(00)02121-4|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|volume=25|issue=4|pages=217–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Leonardo da Vinci]] made his anatomical sketches based on observing and dissecting 30 [[cadaver]]s. His sketches were very detailed and included organs, muscles of superior extremity, the hand, and the skull. Leonardo was well known for his three-dimensional drawings. His anatomical drawings were not found until 380 years after his death.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=Sanjib Kumar|date=2015-03-01|title=Evolution of illustrations in anatomy: A study from the classical period in Europe to modern times|journal=Anatomical Sciences Education|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=175–188|doi=10.1002/ase.1479|pmid=25053471|issn=1935-9780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ambroise Paré (1510–1590) ===
{{main|Ambroise Paré}}

Paré was a French surgeon, anatomist and an inventor of [[surgical instruments]]. He was a military surgeon during the French campaigns in Italy of 1533–36. It was here that, having run out of boiling oil (which was the accepted way of treating firearm wounds), Paré turned to an ancient Roman remedy: [[turpentine]], egg yolk and oil of roses. He applied it to the wounds and found that it relieved pain and sealed the wound effectively. Paré also introduced the ligatures of arteries; silk threads would be used to tie up the arteries of amputated limbs to try to stop the bleeding. As [[antiseptic]]s had not yet been invented this method led to an increased fatality rate and was abandoned by medical professionals of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Grendler | first1 = Paul F. | title = Encyclopedia of the Renaissanc | year = 1999 | publisher = Scribner's | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-684-80511-5 | pages = 399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, Paré set up a school for midwives in [[Paris]] and designed [[artificial limbs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comptonhistory.com/compton2/pare.htm Ambroise Pare&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vesalius was a [[Flemish]]-born anatomist whose dissections of the human body helped to rectify the misconceptions made in Ancient Times, particularly by Galen, who (for religious reasons) had been able only to study animals such as dogs and monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoolshistory.org.uk/vesalius.htm Andreas Vesalius&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote many books on anatomy from his observations; his best-known work was ''[[De humani corporis fabrica|De Humani Corporis Fabrica]]'', published in 1543, which contained detailed drawings of the human body posed as if alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/vesalius_andreas.shtml BBC - History - Andreas Vesalius (] 1514–1564)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This book contained many different anatomic sketches that he made upon examining and dissecting cadavers. These sketches were a combination of Italian and Gothic art. Vesalius identified the anatomical errors in Galen's findings and challenged the academic world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He changed how human anatomy was viewed and researched and is considered a legacy in the medical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mesquita|first=Evandro Tinoco|last2=Júnior|first2=Celso Vale de Souza|last3=Ferreira|first3=Thiago Reigado|title=Andreas Vesalius 500 years - A Renaissance that revolutionized cardiovascular knowledge|journal=Revista Brasileira de Cirurgia Cardiovascular|volume=30|issue=2|pages=260–5|doi=10.5935/1678-9741.20150024|pmc=4462973|pmid=26107459|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] published his book on planetary motion in 1543, one month before Vesalius published his work on anatomy. The work by Copernicus overturned the medieval belief that the earth lay at the center of the universe, and the work by Vesalius overturned the old authorities about the structure of the human body. In 1543, these two separate books fostered a change in understanding of the place of mankind within the macrocosmic structure of the universe and the microcosmic structure of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brotton |first=Jerry (2006). |isbn=978-0192801630 |title=The Renaissance: A Very Short Introduction |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== William Harvey (1578–1657) ===
{{main|William Harvey}}

William Harvey was an English medical doctor-physicist, known for his contributions in heart and blood movement. William Harvey fully believed all medical knowledge should be universal, and he made this his works goal. Accomplished historians credit him for his boldness in his experimental work and his everlasting eagerness to implement modern practice.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Distelzweig|first=Peter|date=2014-01-01|title="Meam de motu &amp; usu cordis, &amp; circuitu sanguinis sententiam": teleology in William Harvey's De motu cordis|journal=Gesnerus|volume=71|issue=2|pages=258–270|issn=0016-9161|pmid=25707098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not the first to propose [[pulmonary circulation]] ([[Ibn al-Nafis]], [[Michael Servetus]] and [[Realdo Colombo]] preceded him), he is credited as the first person in the Western world to give [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative]] arguments for the circulation of blood around the body.&lt;ref&gt;Spotlight Science 9 (GCSE Science Text Book)&lt;/ref&gt;  William Harvey's extensive work on the body's circulation can be found in the written work titles, "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26065591 The Motu Cordis]".This work opens up with clear definitions of anatomy as well as types of anatomy which clearly outlined a universal meaning of these words for various Renaissance [[physician]]s. Anatomy, as defined by William Harvey is, "the faculty that by ocular inspection and dissection [grasps] the uses and actions of the parts."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, to be able to identify the actions or roles each part of the body plays in the overall function of the body by dissection, followed by visual identification. These were the foundation for the further research on the heart and blood vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021106070838/http://www.knowitall.org/kidswork/hospital/history/renaissance/index.html Kids Work! &gt; History of Medicine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hieronymus Fabricius  (1537-1619) ===
{{Main|Hieronymus Fabricius}}

[[Hieronymus Fabricius]]  is an anatomist and surgeon that prepared a human and animal anatomy atlas and these illustrations were used in his work, ''Tabulae Pictae.'' This work includes illustrations from many different artists and Fabricius is credited for providing a turning point in anatomical illustration. Fabricius' illustrations were of natural size and natural colors. After Fabricius' death, [[Tabulae Pictae|''Tabulae'' ''Pictae'']] disappeared and wasn't again discovered until 1909.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Fabricus focused on the human brain and the fissures that are inside of the brain. In ''Tabulae Pictae'', he described the cerebral [[Fissure#Brain|fissure]] that separates the [[temporal lobe]] from the [[frontal lobe]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collice|first=Massimo|last2=Collice|first2=Rosa|last3=Riva|first3=Alessandro|date=2008-10-01|title=Who Discovered the Sylvian Fissure?|journal=Neurosurgery|language=en|volume=63|issue=4|pages=623–628|doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000327693.86093.3f|pmid=18981875|issn=0148-396X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied  veins and was the first to discover the valves inside of veins.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Men's studies''', often called '''men and masculinities''' in academic settings, is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[men]], [[masculinity]], [[feminism]], [[gender]], and [[politics]]. It draws upon [[feminist theory]] in order to analyze different ideologies  having to do with masculinity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allan|first=Jonathan | title = Phallic affect, or why men's rights activists have feelings | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 22&amp;ndash;41 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1097184X15574338 |date= April 2016 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X15574338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through such analysis to examine the multiple ''masculinities'' contained in the idea of masculinity itself. Men's studies also academically examine what it means to be a man in contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Bennett|first=Jessica |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/fashion/masculinities-studies-stonybrook-michael-kimmel.html?_r=0|title=A master's degree in...masculinity?|date=August 8, 2015|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
As a relatively new field of study, men's studies was formed largely in response to, and as a critique of, an emerging [[men's rights]] movement, and as such, has been taught in academic settings only since the 1970s.  In many universities, men's studies is a correlation to [[women's studies]] or part of a larger [[gender studies]] program, and as such its faculty tends to be sympathetic to, or engaged in, advocacy of [[feminist]] politics. Men's studies works with feminist studies to question the relationship that men have with patriarchal power throughout different temporal and historical times.&lt;ref name="Gurfinkel"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gurfinkel|first=Helena|title=Masculinity studies: what is it, and why would a feminist care?|url=https://siuewmst.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/masculinity-studies-what-is-it-and-why-would-a-feminist-care/|website=siuewmst.wordpress.com|publisher=[[Southern Illinois University|SIUE]] Women's Studies Program via [[WordPress]]|date=December 6, 2012|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of plural ''masculinities'' was proposed by [[R.W. Connell]] in her influential book ''Masculinities'' (1995);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R. W. | author-link = R.W. Connell | title = Masculinities | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780745614694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the academic field is today often known as ''men and masculinities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aboim | first = Sofia | title = Plural masculinities: the remaking of the self in private life | page = 5 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781315600901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In contrast to the discipline of [[masculine psychology]], men's studies programs and courses often include contemporary discussions of men's rights, [[feminist theory]], [[queer theory]], [[matriarchy]], [[patriarchy]], and more generally, what proponents describe as the social, historical, and cultural constructions of [[Man|men]]. They often discuss the issues surrounding [[male privilege]], seen as evolving into more subtle forms rather than disappearing in the modern era.

== Construction of Masculinity ==
When pursuing masculinity studies, many scholars began explaining how masculinity is a [[Social constructionism|social construction]]. [[Michael Kimmel]], a prominent scholar in the field of masculinity studies, writes extensively on manhood and its definition. He does this starting with the 19th century in America, when masculinity began to be defined through proving oneself as a man. As a result, the political arena, workplace, family, and whole world was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kimmel |editor1-first=Michael | editor-link = Michael Kimmel |title= The politics of manhood |publisher= [[Temple University Press]] |location= Philadelphia |isbn= 9781566393652 |year=1995 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ksbyvqKZL2MC }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change constructed "[[hegemonic masculinity]]", or the "practice that allowed men's dominance over women to continue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Laurie|first=Timothy | title = Masculinity studies and the jargon of strategy: ''hegemony, tautology, sense'' | journal = [[Angelaki|Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]], special issue: Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13&amp;ndash;30 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | date = 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/10912537/Masculinity_Studies_and_the_Jargon_of_Strategy_Hegemony_Tautology_Sense Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; or the stereotypical definition of masculinity that many think of initially. In unpacking masculinity, the construction is understood [[Intersectionality|intersectionally]], looking at the historical, cultural, temporal, political, and psychological ways in which the definition of masculinity is created.&lt;ref name="Gurfinkel" /&gt; Because of the intersectional lens used to study masculinity, it becomes clear that there are multiple masculinities because of the various experiences that different histories, cultures, and times produce.

== Organizations ==
The [[American Men's Studies Association]] (AMSA) traces the roots of an organized field of men's studies to the early 1980s and the work of scholars involved in an [[Sexism|anti-sexist]] organization called the Men's Studies Task Group (MSTG) of the National Organization for Changing Men (NOCM) which included Martin Acker, Shepherd Bliss, [[Harry Brod]], Sam Femiano, Martin Fiebert, and [[Michael Messner]]. However, men's studies classes also pre-date NOCM, and a small number were taught in various colleges across the United States throughout the 1970s. Conferences such as the Men and Masculinity conferences sparked the creation of newsletters and journals, such as the ''Men's Studies Newsletter'' (and its successor, ''Men’s Studies Review''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Men’s Studies Review (journal) | publisher = American Men's Studies Association (AMSA) | location = Harriman, Tennessee | lccn = 93648850 | issn = 0890-9741}}&lt;/ref&gt; pertaining to the growing field of men's studies. These became prime resources for those interested in the field, providing news, bibliographies, and firsthand experiences. Following the newsletters and journals came the [[Men's Studies Press]], thus moving the academic field of masculinity studies to books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Doyle|first=James. A|last2=Femiano|first2=Sam | title = A history of the Men's Studies Press and its Association with the American Men's Studies Association | journal = [[The Journal of Men's Studies]], special issue: AMSA at 20 | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 24&amp;ndash;33 | publisher = [[Sage Publishing|Sage]] | doi = 10.3149/jms.2101.24 | date = January 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3149/jms.2101.24 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

When NOCM changed its name to the [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.nomas.org/ | website = nomas.org | publisher = [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS) }}&lt;/ref&gt; the MSTG became the Men's Studies Association (MSA). The MSA was an explicitly pro-feminist group, and those who felt this was too constraining split away several years later to form the American Men's Studies Association (AMSA).

== Criticism ==
A range of criticisms have been made of the separation between "men's studies" and "gender studies". For example, Timothy Laurie and Anna Hickey-Moody insist that "[any] atomisation of masculinity studies as distinct from gender studies, feminist inquiry or queer studies must be understood as provisional and hazardous rather than as the result of absolute differences in the phenomena being investigated or expertise required".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laurie | first1 = Timothy | last2 = Hickey-Moody | first2 = Anna | title = Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | journal = [[Angelaki|Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]], special issue: Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;10 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359 | date = 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/10912564 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Joyce E. Canaan and Christine Griffin described their suspicions of The New Men's Studies (TNMS): the emergence of conferences and books on men and masculinity during a time of political and financial cuts to further education and higher education in the UK, "Is it a coincidence that TNMS is being constructed in the present context as a source of potential research, publishing deals, and (even more) jobs for the already-well-paid boys holding prestigious positions?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Canaan | first1 = Joyce E. | last2 = Griffin | first2 = Christine | chapter = The new men's studies: part of the problem or part of the solution | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yC5HBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208 | editor-last1 = Morgan | editor-first1 = D.

==Work and care==
Men's studies are notably concerned with challenging gendered arrangements of work and care, and the male breadwinner role, and policies are increasingly targeting men as fathers, as a tool of changing gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bjørnholt | first = Margunn | authorlink1= Margunn Bjørnholt | title = Changing men, changing times; fathers and sons from an experimental gender equality study | journal = [[The Sociological Review]] | volume = 62 | issue = 2  | pages = 295&amp;ndash;315 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-954X.12156 | date = May 2014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-954X.12156 }} [http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Changing-men-changing-times-fathers-and-sons-from-an-experimental-gender-equality-study.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modern architecture''', or '''modernist architecture''' was based upon new and innovative technologies of construction, particularly the use of [[glass]], [[steel]] and [[reinforced concrete]];  the idea that form should follow function; an embrace of [[minimalism]]; and a rejection of ornament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.architecture.com/knowledge-and-resources/knowledge-landing-page/modernism|title=What is Modern architecture?|language=English|publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It emerged in the first half of the 20th century and became dominant after [[World War II]] until the 1980s, when it was gradually replaced as the  
principal style for institutional and corporate buildings  by [[Postmodern architecture]].{{Sfn|Tietz|1999|pages=6-10}}

==Origins==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Modern architecture emerged at the end of the 19th century from revolutions in technology, engineering and building materials,  and from a desire to break away from historical architectural styles and to invent something that was purely functional and new.

The revolution in materials came first, with the use of [[cast iron]], [[plate glass]], and [[reinforced concrete]], to build structures that were stronger, lighter and taller.  The [[cast plate glass]] process was invented in 1848, allowing the manufacture of very large windows. [[The Crystal Palace]] by [[Joseph Paxton]] at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851 was an early example of iron and plate glass construction, followed in 1864 by the first glass and metal [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]]. These developments together led to the first steel-framed skyscraper, the ten-story [[Home Insurance Building]] in [[Chicago]], built in 1884 by [[William Le Baron Jenney]].{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=42-43}}  The iron frame construction of the [[Eiffel Tower]], then the tallest structure in the world, captured the imagination of millions of visitors to the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Paris Universal Exposition]].{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=14-16}}

French industrialist [[François Coignet]] was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete, that is, concrete strengthened with iron bars,  as a technique for constructing buildings.&lt;ref name="britannia"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124672/Francois-Coignet Encyclopædia Britannica - François Coignet]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 Coignet built the first iron reinforced concrete structure, a four-story house in the suburbs of Paris.&lt;ref name="britannia"/&gt; A further important step forward was the invention of the safety [[elevator]] by [[Elisha Otis]], first demonstrated at the Crystal Palace exposition in 1852, which made tall office and apartment buildings practical.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=42}}    Another important technology for the new architecture was electric light, which greatly reduced the inherent danger of fires caused by gas in the 19th century.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=16}}

The debut of new materials and techniques inspired architects to break away from the neoclassical and eclectic models that dominated European and American architecture in the late 19th century,  most notably [[Eclecticism in art|eclecticism]], [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian architecture]], and the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts architectural style]].&lt;ref&gt;Crouch, Christopher. 2000.

In his 1872 book ''Entretiens sur L'Architecture'',  he urged: "use the means and knowledge given to us by our times, without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can inaugurate a new architecture. For each function its material;  for each material its form and its ornament."&lt;ref&gt;Viollet Le-duc, ''Entretiens sur Architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;  This book influenced a generation of architects, including [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Hector Guimard]], and [[Antoni Gaudí]].{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=24}}

At the end of the 19th century, a few architects began to challenge the traditional [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] styles that dominated architecture in Europe and the United States.  The [[Glasgow School of Art]] (1896-99) designed by [[Charles Rennie MacIntosh]], had a facade dominated by large vertical bays of windows.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=27}} The [[Art Nouveau]] style was launched in the 1890s by [[Victor Horta]] in Belgium and [[Hector Guimard]] in France; it introduced new styles of decoration, based on vegetal and floral forms.  In Barcelona, [[Antonio Gaudi]] conceived architecture as a form of sculpture; the facade of the [[Casa Battlo]] in [[Barcelona]] (1904–1907) had no straight lines; it was encrusted with colorful mosaics of stone and ceramic tiles {{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=33}}

Architects also began to experiment with new materials and techniques, which gave them greater freedom to create new forms. In 1903–1904 in Paris [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Henri Sauvage]] began to use [[reinforced concrete]], previously only used for industrial structures, to build apartment buildings.{{Sfn|Poisson|pages=318-319}}  Reinforced concrete, which could be molded into any shape, and which could create enormous spaces without the need of supporting pillars, replaced stone and brick as the primary material for modernist architects. The first concrete apartment buildings by Perret and Sauvage were covered with ceramic tiles, but in 1905 Perret built the first concrete parking garage on 51 rue de Ponthieu in Paris; here the concrete was left bare, and the space between the concrete was filled with glass windows. [[Henri Sauvage]] added another construction innovation in an apartment building on Rue Vavin in Paris (1912–1914); the reinforced concrete building was in steps, with each floor set back from the floor below, creating a series of terraces.  Between 1910 and 1913, Auguste Perret built the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]], a masterpiece of reinforced concrete construction, with Art Deco sculptural bas-reliefs on the facade by [[Antoine Bourdelle]]. Because of the concrete construction, no columns blocked the spectator's view of the stage.{{Sfn|Poisson|2009|page=318}}

[[Otto Wagner]], in Vienna, was another pioneer of the new style. In his book ''Moderne Architektur'' (1895) he had called for a more rationalist style of architecture, based on "modern life".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0226869393 Otto Wagner, ''Modern Architecture: A Guidebook for His Students to this Field of Art''], 1895, translation by Harry Francis Mallgrave, Getty Publications, 1988, {{ISBN|0226869393}}&lt;/ref&gt; He designed a stylized ornamental metro station at [[Karlsplatz]] in Vienna (1888–89), then an ornamental [[Art Nouveau]] residence, Majolika House (1898), before moving to a much more geometric and simplified style, without ornament, in the [[Austrian Postal Savings Bank]] (1904–1906).  Wagner declared his intention to express the function of the building in its exterior.  The reinforced concrete exterior was covered with plaques of marble attached with bolts of polished aluminum. The interior was purely functional and spare,  a large open space of steel, glass and concrete where the only decoration was the structure itself.{{Sfn|Bony|page=36}}

The Viennese architect [[Adolf Loos]] also began removing any ornament from his buildings.  His [[Steiner House]], in Vienna (1910), was an example of what he called [[rationalist architecture]]; it had a simple stucco rectangular facade with square windows and no ornament. . The fame of the new movement, which became known as the [[Vienna Secession]] spread beyond Austria. [[Josef Hoffmann]], a student of Wagner, constructed a landmark of early modernist architecture, the [[Palais Stoclet]], in Brussels, in 1906–1911. This residence, built of brick covered with Norwegian marble, was composed of geometric blocks, wings and a tower.  A large pool in front of the house reflected its cubic forms. The interior was decorated with paintings by [[Gustav Klimt]] and other artists, and the architect even designed clothing for the family to match the architecture.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=38}}

In Germany, a modernist industrial movement, [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Work Federation) had been created in Munich in 1907 by [[Hermann Muthesius]], a prominent architectural commentator. Its goal was to bring together designers and industrialists,  to turn out well-designed, high quality products, and in the process to invent a new type of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Lucius Burckhardt (1987) . ''The Werkbund''. ? : Hyperion Press. ISBN. Frederic J. Schwartz (1996). ''The Werkbund: Design Theory and Mass Culture Before the First World War''. New Haven, Conn. : Yale University Press. ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization originally included twelve architects and twelve business firms, but quickly expanded. The architects include [[Peter Behrens]], [[Theodor Fischer]] (who served as its first president), [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Richard Riemerschmid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]]. "Joseph August Lux: Werkbund Promoter, Historian of a Lost Modernity," ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' 63/1 (June 2004): 202&amp;ndash;219.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 Behrens designed one of the earliest and most influential industrial buildings in the modernist style, the AEG turbine factory, a functional monument of steel and concrete. In 1911–1913, [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] and [[Walter Gropius]], who had both worked for Behrens, built another revolutionary industrial plant, the Fagus factory in Alfeld an der Leine, a building without ornament where every construction element was on display. The Werkbund organized a major exposition of modernist design in Cologne just a few weeks before the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.  For the 1914 Cologne exhibition, [[Bruno Taut]] built a revolutionary glass pavilion.{{Sfn|Tietz|1999|page=19}}

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was a highly original and independent American architect who refused to be categorized in any one architectural movement.  Like [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], he had no formal architectural training. In 1887-93 he worked in the Chicago office of [[Louis Sullivan]], who pioneered the first tall steel-frame office buildings in Chicago, and who famously stated "form follows function." {{Sfn|Tietz|1999|page=16}}  Wright set out to break all the traditional rules. Wright was particularly famous for his [[Prairie Houses]],  including the [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]] in [[River Forest, Illinois]](1893–94),;[[Arthur Heurtley House]] (1902) and [[Robie House]] (1909); sprawling, geometric residences without decoration, with strong horizontal lines which seemed to grow out of the earth, and which echoed the wide flat spaces of the American prairie.  His [[Larkin Administration Building|Larkin Building]] (1904–1906) in [[Buffalo, New York]], [[Unity Temple]] (1905) in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] and [[Unity Temple]] had highly original forms and no connection with historical precedents.  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=62-63}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
At the end of the 19th century, the first [[skyscrapers]] began to appear in the United States.  They were a response to the shortage of land and high cost of real estate in the center of the fast-growing American cities, and the availability of new technologies, including fireproof steel frames and improvements in the safety [[elevator]] invented by [[Elisha Otis]] in 1852. The first steel-framed "skyscraper", The [[Home Insurance Building]] in Chicago, was ten stories high. It was designed by [[William Le Baron Jenney]] in 1883, and was briefly the tallest building in the world. [[Louis Sullivan]] built another monumental new structure, the [[Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building]], in the heart of Chicago in 1904-06. While these buildings were revolutionary in their steel frames and height, their decoration was borrowed from neo-renaissance, [[Neo-Gothic]] and [[Beaux-Arts architecture]].  The [[Woolworth Building]], designed by [[Cass Gilbert]], was completed in 1912, and was the tallest building in the world until the completion of the [[Chrysler Building]] in 1929.  The structure was purely modern, but its exterior was decorated with [[Neo-Gothic]] ornament, complete with decorative buttresses, arches and spires, which caused it be nicknamed the "Cathedral of Commerce."   {{Sfn|Burchard and Brown|1966|page=83}}

==Rise of Modernism in Europe and Russia (1918–1931)==
After the first World War, a prolonged struggle began between architects who favored the more traditional styles of [[neo-classicism]] and the [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] style, and the modernists, led by [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] in France, [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] in Germany, and [[Konstantin Melnikov]] in the new [[Soviet Union]], who wanted only pure forms and the elimination of any decoration. [[Art Deco]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Henri Sauvage]] often made a compromise between the two, combining modernist forms and stylized decoration.

The dominant figure in the rise of modernism in France was Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, a Swiss-French architect who in 1920 took the name [[Le Corbusier]].  In 1920 he co-founded a journal called '''L'Espirit Nouveau'' and energetically promoted architecture that was functional, pure, and free of any decoration or historical associations.  He was also a passionate advocate of a new urbanism, based on planned cities.  In 1922 he presented a design of a city for three million people, whose inhabitants lived in identical sixty-story tall skyscrapers surrounded by open parkland. He designed modular houses, which would be mass-produced on the same plan and assembled into apartment blocks, neighborhoods and cities. In 1923 he published "Toward an Architecture", with his famous slogan, "a house is a machine for living in."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture", (1923), Flammarion edition (1995), pages XVIII-XIX&lt;/ref&gt;  He tirelessly promoted his ideas through slogans, articles, books, conferences, and participation in Expositions.

To illustrate his ideas, in the 1920s he built a series of houses and villas in and around Paris.  They were all built according to a common system,  based upon the use of reinforced concrete, and of reinforced concrete pylons in the interior which supported the structure, allowing glass curtain walls on the facade and open floor plans, independent of the structure.  They were always white, and had no ornament or decoration on the outside or inside. The best-known of these houses was the [[Villa Savoye]], built in 1928–1931 in the Paris suburb of [[Poissy]].  An elegant white box wrapped with a ribbon of glass windows around on the facade, with living space that opened upon an interior garden and countryside around, raised up by a row of white pylons in the center of a large lawn, it became an icon of modernist architecture.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In Germany, two important modernist movements appeared after the first World War,   The [[Bauhaus]] was a school organized [[Weimar]] in 1919 under the direction of [[Walter Gropius]].  Gropius was the son of the official state architect of Berlin, who studied before the war with [[Peter Behrens]], and designed the modernist Fagus turbine factory.  The Bauhaus was a fusion of the prewar Academy of Arts and the school of technology.  In 1926 it was transferred from Weimar to Dessau;  Gropius designed the new school and student dormitories in the new, purely functional modernist style he was encouraging.  The school brought together modernists in all fields;  the faculty included the modernist painters [[Vasily Kandinsky]], [[Josef Albers|Joseph Albers]] and [[Paul Klee]], and the designer [[Marcel Breuer]].

Gropius became an important theorist of modernism, writing ‘’The Idea and Construction’’ in 1923.  He was an advocate of standardization in architecture, and the mass construction of rationally-designed apartment blocks for factory workers.  In 1928 he was commissioned by the [[Siemens]] company to build apartment for workers in the suburbs of Berlin,  and in 1929 he proposed the construction of clusters of slender eight to ten story high rise apartment towers for workers.

While Gropius was active at the Bauhaus, [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] led the modernist architectural movement in Berlin.  Inspired by the [[De Stijl]] movement in the Netherlands, he built clusters of concrete summer houses and proposed a project for a glass office tower.  He became the vice president of the German ‘’Werkbund’’, and became the head of the Bauhaus from 1930 to 1932.  proposing a wide variety of modernist plans for urban reconstruction.  His most famous modernist work was the German pavilion for the 1929 international exposition in Barcelona. It was a work of pure modernism, with glass and concrete walls and clean, horizontal lines.  Though it was only a temporary structure, and was torn down in 1930, it became, along with Le Corbusier's [[Villa Savoye]], one of best-known landmarks of modernist architecture.  A reconstructed version now stands on the original site in Barcelona.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=93-95}}

When the Nazis came to power in Germany, they viewed the Bauhaus as a training ground for communists, and closed the school in 1932.  Gropius left Germany and went to England, then to the United States, where he and [[Marcel Breuer]] both joined the faculty of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], and became the teachers of a generation of American postwar architects. In 1937 Mies van der Rohe also moved to the United States; he became one of the most famous designers of postwar American skyscrapers.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=93-95}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Expressionism]], which appeared in Germany between 1910 and 1925, was a counter-movement against the strictly functional architecture of the Bauhaus and Werkbund.  Its advocates, including [[Bruno Taut]], [[Hans Poelzig]], [[Fritz Hoger]] and [[Erich Mendelsohn]], wanted to create architecture that was poetic, expressive, and optimistic. Many expressionist architects had fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the [[German Revolution]] of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid–1920s,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;   As result, many of the most innovative expressionist projects, including [[Bruno Taut]]'s ''Alpine Architecture'' and [[Hermann Finsterlin]]'s ''Formspiels'', remained on paper. [[Scenography]] for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination,&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economic climate. A particular type, using bricks to create its forms (rather than concrete) is known as [[Brick Expressionism]].

[[Erich Mendelsohn]],  (who disliked the term Expressionism for his work) began his career designing churches, silos, and factories which were highly imaginative, but, for lack of resources, were never built In 1920, he finally was able to construct one of his works in the city of Potsdam;  an observatory and research center called the [[Einsteinium]], named in tribute to [[Albert Einstein]].  It was supposed to be built of reinforced concrete, but because of technical problems it was finally built of traditional materials covered with plaster. His sculptural form, very different from the austere rectangular forms of the Bauhaus, first won him commissions to build movie theaters and retail stores in Stuttgart, Nuremberg and Berlin. His [[Mossehaus]] in Berlin was an early model for the [[streamline moderne]] style.  His [[Columbushaus]] on Potsdamer Platz in Berlin (1931) was a prototype for the modernist office buildings that followed. (It was torn down in 1957, because it stood in the zone between East and West Berlin, where the [[Berlin Wall]] was constructed.)  Following the rise of the Nazis to power, he moved to England (1933), then to the United States (1941).{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=95}}

[[Fritz Höger]] was another notable Expressionist architect of the period.  His [[Chilehaus]] was built as the headquarters of a shipping company, and was modeled after a giant steamship, a triangual building with a sharply pointed bow. It was constructed of dark brick, and used external piers to express its vertical structure. Its external decoration borrowed from Gothic cathedrals, as did its internal arcades. [[Hans Poelzig]] was another notable expressionist architect.  In 1919 he built the ''[[Großes Schauspielhaus]]'', an immense theater in Berlin, seating five thousand spectators for theater impresario [[Max Reinhardt]].  It featured elongated shapes like stalagmites hanging down from its gigantic dome, and lights on massive columns in its foyer. He also constructed the [[IG Farben building]], a massive corporate headquarters, now the main building of [[Goethe University]] in Frankfurt. [[Bruno Taut]] specialized in building large scale apartment complexes for working-class Berliners.  He built twelve thousand individual units, sometimes in buildings with unusual shapes, such as a giant horseshoe.  Unlike most other modernists, he used bright exterior colors to give his buildings more life The use of dark brick in the German projects gave that particular style a name, [[Brick Expressionism]].{{Sfn|Tietz|1999|pages=26-27}}

The Austrian philosopher, architect and social critic [[Rudolf Steiner]] also departed as far as possible from traditional architectural forms. His [[Goetheanum|Second Goetheanum]], built from 1926 near [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] the [[Einsteinturm]] in Potsdam, Germany, and the [[Goetheanum|Second Goetheanum]], by [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1926), were based on no traditional models, and had entirely original shapes.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
After the [[Russian Revolution]]  of 1917, Russian avant-garde artists and architects began searching for a new Soviet style which could replace traditional neoclassicism.  The new architectural movements were closely tied with the literary and artistic movements of the period, the [[futurism]] of poet [[Vladimir Mayakovskiy]], the [[Suprematism]] of painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], and the colorful [[Rayonism]] of painter [[Mikhail Larionov]]. The most startling design that emerged was the tower proposed by painter and sculptor [[Vladimir Tatlin]] for the Moscow meeting of the Third [[Communist International]] in 1920:  he proposed two interlaced towers of metal four hundred meters high, with four geometric volumes suspended from cables.  The movement of Russian [[Constructivist architecture]] was launched in 1921 by a group of artists led by [[Aleksandr Rodchenko]].  Their manifesto proclaimed that their goal was to find the "communist expression of material structures." Soviet architects began to construct workers' clubs, communal apartment houses, and communal kitchens for feeding whole neighborhoods.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=86-87}}

One of the first prominent constructivist architects to emerge in Moscow was [[Konstantin Melnikov]], the number of working clubs - including [[Rusakov Workers' Club]] (1928) - and his own living house, [[Melnikov House]] (1929) near [[Arbat Street]] in [[Moscow]].  Melnikov traveled to Paris in 1925 where he built the Soviet Pavilion for the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in Paris in 1925;  it was a highly geometric vertical construction of glass and steel crossed by a diagonal stairway, and crowned with a hammer and sickle.  The leading group of constructivist architects, led by [[Vesnin brothers]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg]], was publishing the 'Contemporary Architecture' journal. This group created several major constructivist projects in the wake of the First Five Year Plan - including colossal [[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station]] (1932) - and made an attempt to start the standardization of living blocks with Ginzburg's [[Narkomfin building]]. A number of architects from the pre-Soviet period also took up the constructivist style.  The most famous example was [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] in Moscow (1924), by [[Alexey Shchusev]] (1924)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Alexey Shchusev (1873-1949)|url = http://www.architectural-review.com/view/reviews/reputations/alexey-shchusev-1873-1949/8660736.article|accessdate = 2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main centers of constructivist architecture were Moscow and Leningrad; however, during the industrialization lots of constructivist buildings were erected in provincial cities. The regional industrial centers, including [[Yekaterinburg|Ekaterinburg]], [[Kharkiv]] or [[Ivanovo]], were rebuilt in the constructivist manner; some cities, like [[Magnitogorsk]] or [[Zaporizhia]], were constructed anew (the so-called ''socgorod'', or 'socialist city').

The style fell markedly out of favor in the 1930s, replaced by the more grandiose nationalist styles that Stalin favored. Constructivist architects and even [[Le Corbusier]] projects for the new [[Palace of the Soviets]] from 1931 to 1933, but the winner was an early Stalinist building in the style termed [[Postconstructivism]].  The last major Russian constructivist building, by [[Boris Iofan]], was built for the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris World Exhibition]] (1937), where it faced the pavilion of Nazi Germany by Hitler's architect [[Albert Speer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Facing Hitler's Pavilion: The Uses of Modernity in the Soviet Pavilion at the 1937 Paris International Exhibition|url = http://jch.sagepub.com/content/47/1/13|journal = Journal of Contemporary History|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 0022-0094|pages = 13–47|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/0022009411422369|first = Danilo|last = Udovički-Selb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernism becomes a movement: CIAM (1928)===
{{main article|Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne}}
By the late 1920s, modernism had become an important movement in Europe.  Architecture, which previously had been predominantly national, began to become international.  The architects traveled, met each other, and shared ideas. Several modernists, including [[Le Corbusier]], had participated in the competition for the headquarters of the [[League of Nations]] in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the [[Weissenhof Estate]] [[Stuttgart]].  Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses; [[Le Corbusier]], and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style.  The first meeting of the ''[[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]]'' or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a chateau on [[Lake Leman]] in Switzerland June 26–28, 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], [[Auguste Perret]], [[Pierre Chareau]] and [[Tony Garnier (architect)|Tony Garnier]] from France; [[Victor Bourgeois]] from Belgium; [[Walter Gropius]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Ernst May]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] from Germany; [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]]  from Austria; [[Mart Stam]] and [[Gerrit Rietveld]] from the Netherlands, and [[Adolf Loos]] from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included [[Josep Lluís Sert]] of Spain and [[Alvar Aalto]] of Finland.  No one attended from the United States.  A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic "Rational methods for groups of habitations".  A third meeting, on "The functional city",  was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized.  The text, called The [[Athens Charter]], after considerable editing by Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1957 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=84-85}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Art Deco]] architectural style (called ''Style Moderne'' in [[France]]),  was modern, but it was not modernist;  it had many features of modernism,  including the use of reinforced concrete, glass, steel, chrome, and it rejected traditional historical models, such as the [[Beaux-Arts style]] and [[Neo-classicism]];  but, unlike the modernist styles of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, it made lavish use of decoration and color.  It reveled in the symbols of modernity; lightning flashes, sunrises, and zig-zags. Art Deco had begun in France before World War I and spread through Europe;  in the 1920s and 1930s it became a highly popular style in the United States, South America, India, China, Australia and Japan.  In Europe, Art Deco was particularly popular for department stores and movie theaters. The style reached its peak in Europe at the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in 1925, which featured art deco pavilions and decoration from twenty countries.  Only two pavilions were purely modernist;  the Esprit Nouveau pavilion of Le Corbusier, which represented his idea for a mass-produced housing unit, and the pavilion of the USSR, by [[Konstantin Melnikov]] in a flamboyantly [[futurist]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Anwas, Victor, ''Art Deco'' (1992), Harry N. Abrams Inc., {{ISBN|0810919265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later French landmarks in the Art Deco style included the [[Grand Rex]] movie theater in Paris, [[La Samaritaine]] department store by [[Henri Sauvage]] (1926–28) and the Social and Economic Council building in Paris (1937–38) by [[Auguste Perret]], and the [[Palais de Tokyo]] and [[Palais de Chaillot]], both built by collectives of architects for the 1937 Paris [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]]. .&lt;ref&gt;Poisson, Michel, ''1000 Immeubles et Monuments de Paris'' (2009), Parigramme, pages 318-319 and 300-01&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the late 1920s and early 1930s, an exuberant American variant of Art Deco appeared in the [[Chrysler Building]], [[Empire State Building]] and [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, and [[Guardian Building]] in Detroit.  The first skyscrapers in Chicago and New York had been designed in a neo-gothic or neoclassical style, but these buildings were very different; they combined modern materials and technology (stainless steel, concrete, aluminum, chrome-plated steel) with Art Deco geometry; stylized zig-zags, lightning flashes, fountains, sunrises, and, at the top of the Chrysler building, Art Deco "gargoyles" in the form of stainless steel radiator ornaments. The interiors of these new buildings, sometimes termed Cathedrals of Commerce", were lavishly decorated in bright contrasting colors, with geometric patterns variously influenced by Egyptian and Mayan pyramids, African textile patterns,  and European cathedrals, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] himself experimented with [[Mayan Revival architecture|Mayan Revival]], in the concrete cube-based [[Ennis House]] of 1924 in Los Angeles. The style appeared in the late 1920s and 1930s in all major American cities.  The style was used most often in office buildings, but it also appeared in the enormous movie palaces that were built in large cities when sound films were introduced.{{Sfn|Duncan}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The beginning of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 brought an end to lavishly-decorated Art Deco architecture and a temporary halt to the construction of new skyscrapers. It also brought in a new style, called "Streamline Moderne" or sometimes just Streamline.  This style, sometimes modeled after for the form of ocean liners, featured rounded corners,  strong horizontal lines, and often nautical features, such as superstructures and steel railings. It was associated with modernity and especially with transportation;  the style was often used for new airport terminals, train and bus stations, and for gas stations and diners built along the growing American highway system.  In the 1930s the style was used not only in buildings, but in railroad locomotives, and even refrigerators and vacuum cleaners.  It both borrowed from [[industrial design]] and influenced it.&lt;!--Raymond Loewy; locomotives, aircraft, and ships, automobiles--&gt;&lt;!--cosmetic functionality--&gt;{{Sfn|Ducher|2014|page=204}}

In the United States, the Great Depression led to a new style for government buildings, sometimes called [[PWA Moderne]], for the [[Public Works Administration]], which launched gigantic construction programs in the U.S. to stimulate employment.  It was essentially classical architecture stripped of ornament, and was employed in state and federal buildings, from post offices to the largest office building in the world at that time, [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] (1941–43), begun just before the United States entered the Second World War.&lt;ref name=GEMWWII&gt;{{cite web|title=Growth, Efficiency, and Modernism|url=http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|publisher=U.S. General Services Administration|accessdate=March 2011|page=27|origyear=2003|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110331105542/http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|archivedate=2011-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Frank Lloyd Wright|Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Richard Neutra}}
During the 1920s and 1930s, Frank Lloyd Wright resolutely refused to associate himself with any architectural movements. He considered his architecture to be entirely unique and his own. Between 1916 and 1922, he broke away from his earlier prairie house style and worked instead on houses decorated with textured blocks of cement; this became known as his "Mayan style", after the pyramids of the ancient Mayan civilization. He experimented for a time with modular mass-produced housing. He identified his architecture as "Usonian", a combination of USA, "utopian" and "organic social order". His business was severely affected by the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] that began in 1929; he had fewer wealthy clients who wanted to experiment.  Between 1928 and 1935, he built only two buildings: a hotel near [[Chandler, Arizona]], and the most famous of all his residences, [[Fallingwater]] (1934–37), a vacation house in Pennsylvania for Edgar J. Kaufman. Fallingwater is a remarkable structure of concrete slabs suspended over a waterfall, perfectly uniting architecture and nature.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=99}}

The Austrian architect [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolph Schindler]] designed what could be called the first house in the modern style in 1922, the Schindler house. 
Schindler also contributed to American modernism with his design for the Lovell beach house in [[Newport Beach]]. The Austrian architect [[Richard Neutra]] moved to the United States in 1923, worked for short time with Frank Lloyd Wright, also quickly became a force in American architecture through his modernist design for the same client, the [[Lovell House]] in [[Los Angeles]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Paris International Exposition]] in Paris effectively marked the end of the Art Deco, and of pre-war architectural styles.  Most of the pavilions were in a neoclassical Deco style, with colonnades and sculptural decoration.  The pavilions of Nazi Germany, designed by [[Albert Speer]], in a German neoclassical style topped by eagle and swastika, faced the pavilion of the Soviet Union, topped by enormous statues of a worker and a peasant carrying a hammer and sickle.  As to the modernists, Le Corbusier was practically, but not quite invisible at the Exposition; he participated in the Pavilion des temps nouveaux, but focused mainly on his painting.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|page=216}} The one modernist who did attract attention was a collaborator of Le Corbusier, [[Josep Lluis Sert]], the Spanish-Catalan architect, whose pavilion of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was pure modernist glass and steel box. Inside it displayed the most modernist work of the Exposition, the painting ''[[Guernica]]'' by [[Pablo Picasso]]. The original building was destroyed after the Exposition, but it was recreated in 1992 in Barcelona.

The rise of nationalism in the 1930s was reflected in the [[Fascist architecture]] of Italy, and [[Nazi architecture]] of Germany, based on classical styles and designed to express power and grandeur. The Nazi architecture, much of it designed by [[Albert Speer]], was intended to awe the spectators by its huge scale.  Adolf Hitler intended to turn Berlin into the capital of Europe, more grand than Rome or Paris.  The Nazis closed the Bauhaus, and the most prominent modern architects soon departed for Britain or the United States.  In Italy, Benito Mussolini wished to present himself as the heir to the glory and empire of ancient Rome.&lt;ref name=Frampton1&gt;{{cite book|last=Frampton|first=Kenneth|title=Modern Architecture: A Critical History|year=1980 |publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0-500-20257-5|pages=210–218|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mussolini's government was not as hostile to modernism as The Nazis;  the spirit of [[Rationalism (architecture)|Italian Rationalism]] of the 1920s continued, with the work of architect [[Giuseppe Terragni]] His ''Casa dl Fascio'' in Como, headquarters of the local Fascist party, was a perfectly modernist building,  with geometric proportions (33.2 meters long by 16.6 meters high);  a clean facade of marble, and a Renaissance-inspired interior courtyard.  Opposed to Terragni was Marcello Piacitini, a proponent of monumental fascist architecture, who rebuilt the University of Rome, and designed the Italian pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exposition, and planned a grand reconstruction of Rome on the fascist model.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=120-121}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[1939 New York World's Fair]] marked a turning point in architecture between the Art Deco and modern architecture.  The theme of the Fair was the ''World of Tomorrow'', and its symbols were the purely geometric trilon and perisphere sculpture. It had many monuments to Art Deco, such as the Ford Pavilion in the [[Streamline Moderne]] style, but also included the new International Style that would replace Art Deco as the dominant style after the War. The Pavilions of Finland,  by [[Alvar Aalto]], of Sweden by [[Sven Markelius]], and of Brazil by [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[Lucio Costa]], looked forward to a new style.  They became leaders in the postwar modernist movement.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=128}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[World War II]] (1939–1945) and its aftermath was a major factor in driving innovation in building technology, and in turn, architectural possibilities.&lt;ref name=GEMWWII /&gt;&lt;ref name=Materials&gt;{{cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Building Materials|year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-032573-1 |pages= 41–42, 48–49 |editor=Thomas C. Jester}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wartime industrial demands resulted in shortages of steel and other building materials, leading to the adoption of new materials, such as aluminum, The war and postwar period brought greatly expanded use of [[prefabricated building]]; largely for the military and government. The semi-circular metal [[Nissen hut]] of World War I was revived as the [[Quonset hut]].  The years immediately after the war saw the development of radical experimental houses, including the enameled-steel [[Lustron house]] (1947–1950), and Buckminster Fuller's experimental aluminum [[Dymaxion House]].&lt;ref name=Materials /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Building Materials |year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-032573-1|page=259|editor=Thomas C. Jester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unprecedented destruction caused by the war was another factor in the rise of modern architecture.  Large parts of major cities, from Berlin, Tokyo and Dresden to Rotterdam and east London; all the port cities of France, particularly [[Le Havre]], Brest,  Marseille, Cherbourg had been destroyed by bombing.  In the United States, little civilian construction had been done since the 1920s;  housing was needed for millions of American soldiers returning from the war.  The postwar housing shortages in Europe and the United States led to the design and construction of enormous government-financed housing projects, usually in run-down center of American cities, and in the suburbs of Paris and other European cities, where land was available,

One of the largest reconstruction projects was that of the city center of Le Havre, destroyed by the Germans and by Allied bombing in 1944;  133 hectares of buildings in the center were flattened, destroying 12,500 buildings and leaving 40,000 persons homeless. The architect [[Auguste Perret]], a pioneer in the use of reinforced concrete and prefabricated materials, designed and built an entirely new center to the city, with apartment blocks, cultural, commercial and government buildings. He restored historic monuments when possible, and built a new church, St. Joseph,  with a lighthouse-like tower in the center to inspire hope.  His rebuilt city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2005.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=140-41}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Shortly after the War, the French architect [[Le Corbusier]], who was nearly sixty years old and had not constructed a building in ten years, was commissioned by the French government to construct a new apartment block in [[Marseille]].  He called it [[Unité d'Habitation]] in Marseille, but it more popularly took the name of the [[Cité Radieuse]], after his book about futuristic urban planning.  Following his doctrines of design, the building had a concrete frame raised up above the street on pylons.  it contained 337 duplex apartment units, fit into the framework like pieces of a puzzle. Each unit had two levels and a small terrace.  Interior "streets"  had shops, a nursery school and other serves, and the flat terrace roof had a running track, ventilation ducts,  and a small theater.  Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional;  the only decoration was a choice of interior colors that Le Corbusier gave to residents. Unité d'Habitation became a prototype for similar buildings in other cities, both in France and Germany.  Combined with his equally radical organic design for the [[Notre Dame du Haut|Chapel of Notre-Dame du-Haut]] at [[Ronchamp]], this work propelled Corbusier in the first rank of postwar modern architects.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|pages=152-163}}

==Postwar modernism in the United States (1945–1985)==
{{main article|International Style (architecture)}}
The [[International Style (architecture)|international Style]] of architecture had appeared in Europe, particularly in the [[Bauhaus]] movement,  in the late 1920s.  In 1932 it was recognized and given a name at an Exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City organized by architect [[Philip Johnson]] and architectural critic [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]],  Between 1937 and 1941, following the rise Hitler and the Nazis in Germany, most of the leaders of the German [[Bauhaus]] movement found a new home in the United States, and played an important part in the development of American modern architecture.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was eighty years old in 1947;  he had been present at the beginning of American modernism, and though he refused to accept that he belonged to any movement, continued to play a leading role almost to its end. One of his most original late projects was the campus of [[Florida Southern College]] in [[Lakeland, Florida]], begun in 1941 and completed in 1943.  He designed nine new buildings in a style that he described as "The [[Child of the Sun]]". He wrote that he wanted the campus to "grow out of the ground and into the light, a child of the sun."

He completed several notable projects in the 1940s, including the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]] and the [[Price Tower]] in [[Bartlesville]], Oklahoma (1956). The building is unusual that it is supported by its central core of four elevator shafts;  the rest of the building is cantilevered to this core, like the branches of a tree. Wright originally planned the structure for an apartment building in New York City.  That project was cancelled because of the [[Great Depression]], and he adapted the design for an oil pipeline and equipment company in Oklahoma.  He wrote that in New York City his building would have been lost in a forest of tall buildings, but that in Oklahoma it stood alone.  The design is asymmetrical;  each side is different.

In 1943 he was commissioned by the art collector [[Solomon R. Guggenheim]] to design a museum for his collection of modern art. His design was entirely original;  a bowl-shaped building with a spiral ramp inside that led museum visitors on an upward tour of the art of the 20th century.  Work began in 1946 but it was not completed until 1959, the year that he died.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=128}}

[[Walter Gropius]], the founder of the [[Bauhaus]], moved to England in 1934 and spent three years there before being invited to the United States by Walter Hudnut of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]];  Gropius became the head of the architecture faculty. [[Marcel Breuer]], who had worked with him at the Bauhaus, joined him and opened an office in Cambridge.  The fame of Gropius and Breuer attracted many students, who themselves became famous architects, including [[Ieoh Ming Pei]] and [[Philip Johnson]].  They did not receive an important commission until 1941, when they designed housing for workers in Kensington, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.,  In 1945 Gropius and Breuer associated with a group of younger architects under the name TAC ([[The Architects Collaborative]]).  Their notable works included the building of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], the U.S. Embassy in Athens (1956–57), and the headquarters of Pan American Airways in New York (1958–63).  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=120}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] described his architecture with the famous saying, "Less is more". As the director of the school of architecture of what is now called the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] from 1939 to 1956, Mies (as he was commonly known) made Chicago the leading city for American modernism in the postwar years.  He constructed new buildings for the Institute in modernist style, two high-rise apartment buildings on Lakeshore Drive (1948–51), which became models for high-rises across the country.  Other major works included [[Farnsworth House]] in [[Plano, Illinois]] (1945–1951), a simple horizontal glass box that had an enormous influence on American residential architecture.  The Chicago Convention Center (1952–54) and [[Crown Hall]] at the Illinois Institute of Technology (1950–56), and The [[Seagram Building]] in New York City (1954–58) also set a new standard for purity and elegance.  Based on granite pillars, the smooth glass and steel walls were given a touch of color by the use of bronze-toned I-beams in the structure. He returned to Germany in 1962-68 to build the new Nationalgallerie in Berlin.  His students and followers included [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Eero Saarinen]], whose work was substantially influenced by his ideas.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=129}}

Influential residential architects in the new style in the United States included [[Richard Neutra]] and [[Charles and Ray Eames]].  The most celebrated work of the Eames was [[Eames House]] in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]], California,  (1949) Charles Eames in collaboration with [[Eero Saarinen]]  It is composed of two structures, an architects residence and his studio,  joined in the form of an L. The house, influenced by Japanese architecture, is made of translucent and transparent panels organized in simple volumes, often using natural materials, supported on a steel framework.  The frame of the house was assembled in sixteen hours by five workmen.  He brightened up his buildings with panels of pure colors.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=135}}

[[Richard Neutra]] continued to build influential houses in Los Angeles, using the theme of the simple box. Many of these houses erased the line distinction between indoor and outdoor spaces with walls of plate glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiacc.org/cgi-bin/htmlos.cgi/00671.3.4558823583020346930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721235921/http://www.aiacc.org/cgi-bin/htmlos.cgi/00671.3.4558823583020346930|date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutra's [[Constance Perkins House]] in [[Pasadena, California]] (1962) was re-examination of the modest single-family dwelling.  It was built of inexpensive material–wood, plaster, and glass–and completed at a cost of just under $18,000. Neutra scaled the house to the physical dimensions of its owner, a small woman. It features a reflecting pool which meanders under of the glass walls of the house. One of Neutra's most unusual buildings was [[Shepherd's Grove]] in [[Garden Grove, California]], which featured an adjoining parking lot where worshippers could follow the service without leaving their cars.

Many of the notable modern buildings in the postwar years were produced by two architectural mega-agencies, which brought together large teams of designers for very complex projects. The firm of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] was founded in Chicago in 1936 by [[Louis Skidmore]] and [[Nathaniel Owings]], and joined in 1939 by engineer [[John O. Merrill|John Merrill]],  It soon went under the name of SOM.  Its first big project was [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], the gigantic government installation that produced plutonium for the first nuclear weapons. In 1964 the firm had eighteen "partner-owners", 54 "associate participants,"and 750 architects, technicians, designers, decorators, and landscape architects.  Their style was largely inspired by the work of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], and their buildings soon had a large place in the New York skyline, including the [[Lever House]] (1951-52) and the [[Manufacturers Trust Company Building]] (1954).  Later buildings by the firm include [[Beinecke Library]] at [[Yale University]] (1963),  the [[Willis Tower]], formerly Sears Tower in Chicago (1973) and [[One World Trade Center]] in New York City  (2013), which replaced the building destroyed in the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=132-33}}

[[Wallace Harrison]] played a major part in the modern architectural history of New York;  as the architectural advisor of the [[Rockefeller Family]], he helped design [[Rockefeller Center]], the major Art Deco architectural project of the 1930s. He was supervising architect for the 1939 New York World's Fair, and, with his partner [[Max Abramowitz]], was the builder and chief architect of the [[United Nations Building]];  Harrison headed a committee of international architects, which included [[Oscar Niemeyer]] (who produced the original plan approved by the committee) and [[Le Corbusier]],    Other landmark New York buildings designed by Harrison and his firm included [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]], the master plan for [[Lincoln Center]], and [[John F. Kennedy Airport]].{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=132}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Philip Johnson]] (1906-2005) was one of the youngest and last major figures in American modern architecture.  He trained at Harvard with Walter Gropius, then was director of the department of architecture and modern design at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] from 1946 to 1954. In 1947, he published a book about Mies van der Rohe, and in 1953 designed his own residence, the [[Glass House]] in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]] in a style modeled after Mies's [[Farnsworth House]]. Beginning in 1955 he began to go in his own direction, moving gradually toward expressionism with designs that increasingly departed from the orthodoxies of modern architecture.  His final and decisive break with modern architecture was the AT&amp;T Building (later known as the Sony Tower, and now the [[550 Madison Avenue]] in New York City, (1979) an essentially modernist skyscraper completely altered by the addition of curved cap at the top of a piece of [[chippendale furniture]].  This building is generally considered to mark the beginning of [[Postmodern architecture]] in the United States.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=132}}

===Eero Saarinen===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Eero Saarinen]] (1910–1961) was the son of [[Eliel Saarinen]], the most famous Finnish architect of the Art Nouveau period, who emigrated to the United States in 1923, when Eero was thirteen. He studied art and sculpture at the academy where his father taught, and then at the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]] Academy in Paris before studying architecture at Yale University.  His architectural designs were more like enormous pieces of sculpture than traditional modern buildings; he broke away from the elegant boxes inspired by Mies van der Rohe and used instead sweeping curves and parabolas, like the wings of birds.  In 1948 he conceived the idea of a monument in St. Louis, Missouri in the form of a parabolic arch 192 meters high, made of stainless steel (1948). He then designed the [[General Motors Technical Center]] in Warren, Michigan (1949–55), a glass modernist box in the style of Mies van der Rohe, followed by the IBM Research Center in Yorktown, Virginia (1957–61).  His next works were a major departure in style; he produced a particularly striking sculptural design for the [[Ingalls Rink]] in [[New Haven]], Connecticut (1956–59, an ice skiing rink with a parabolic roof suspended from cables,  which served as a preliminary model for next and most famous work,  the [[TWA Terminal]]  at JFK airport in New York (1956–1962). His declared intention was to design a building that was distinctive and memorable, and also one that would capture the particular excitement of passengers before a journey.  The structure is separated into four white concrete parabolic vaults, which together resemble a bird on the ground perched for flight.  Each of the four curving roof vaults has two sides attached to columns in a Y form just outside the structure.  One of the angles of each shell is lightly raised, and the other is attached to the center of the structure. The roof is connected with the ground by curtain walls of glass. All of the details inside the building,  including the benches, counters,  escalators and clocks, were designed in the same style.  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=171-72}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Louis Kahn]] (1901–74) was another American architect who moved away from the Mies van der Rohe model of the glass box, and other dogmas of the prevailing international style. He borrowed from a wide variety of styles, and idioms, including neoclassicism. He was professor of architecture at Yale University from 1947–57, where his students included [[Eero Saarinen]].  From 1957 until his death he was professor of architecture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  His work and ideas influenced [[Philip Johnson]], [[Minoru Yamasaki]], and [[Edward Durell Stone]]  as they moved toward a more neoclassical style.  Unlike Mies, he did not try to make his buildings look light;  he constructed mainly with concrete and brick, and made his buildings look monumental and solid.  He drew from a wide variety of different sources;  the towers of [[Richards Medical Research Laboratories]] were inspired by the architecture of the Renaissance towns he had seen in Italy as a resident architect at the [[American Academy in Rome]] in 1950. Notable buildings by Kahn in the United States include the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester]], New York (1962);  and the [[Kimball Art Museum]] in [[Fort Worth]], Texas (1966–72).  Following the example of [[Le Corbusier]] and his design of the government buildings in [[Chandigarh]], the capital city of the [[Haryana]] &amp; [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] State of India, Kahn designed the [[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]] (National Assembly Building) in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] (1962–74), when that country won independence from Pakistan. It was Kahn's last work.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=149}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[I. M. Pei]] (born 1917) is a major figure in late modernism and the debut of [[Post-modern architecture]]. He was born in China and educated in the United States, studying architecture at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. While the architecture school there still trained in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] style, Pei discovered the writings of [[Le Corbusier]], and a two-day visit by Le Corbusier to the campus in 1935 had a major impact on Pei's ideas of architecture. In the late 1930s he moved to the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he studied with [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]] and became deeply involved in Modernism.{{Sfn|Boehm|2000|page=36}}  After the War he worked on large projects for the New York real estate developer [[William Zeckendorf]], before breaking away and starting his own firm. One of the first buildings his own firm designed was the [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]] at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While the clean modernist facade was admired, the building developed an unexpected problem; it created a wind-tunnel effect, and in strong winds the doors could not be opened. Pei was forced to construct a tunnel so visitors could enter the building during high winds.

Between 1963 and 1967 Pei designed the [[Mesa Laboratory]] for the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] outside [[Boulder, Colorado]], in an open area at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The project differed from Pei's earlier urban work; it would rest in an open area in the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. His design was a striking departure from traditional modernism;  it looked as if it were carved out of the side of the mountain.{{Sfn|Boehm|2000|page=59}}

In the late modernist area, art museums bypassed skyscrapers as the most prestigious architectural projects;  they offered greater possibilities for innovation in form and more visibility.  Pei established himself with his design for the [[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art]] at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]] (1973), which was praised for its imaginative use of a small space, and its respect for the landscape and other buildings around it.  This led to the commission for one of the most important museum projects of the period, the new East Wing of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, completed in 1978,  and to another of Pei's most famous projects, the pyramid at the entrance of [[Louvre Museum]] in Paris (1983–89). Pei chose the pyramid as the form that best harmonized with the Renaissance and neoclassical forms of the historic Louvre., as well as for its associations with Napoleon and the [[Battle of the Pyramids]]. Each face of the pyramid is supported by 128 beams of stainless steel, supporting 675 panels of glass, each 2.9 by 1.9 meters.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=210}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In France, [[Le Corbusier]] remained the most prominent architect, though he built few buildings there.  His most prominent late work was the convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] in Evreaux-sur-l'Arbresle.  The Convent, built of raw concrete, was austere and without ornament,  inspired by the medieval monasteries he had visited on his first trip to Italy.  {{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=164-165}}

In Britain, the major figures in modernism included [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] (1926–1992) and [[Denys Lasdun]] (1914–2001).  Lasdun's best-known work is the [[Royal National Theatre]] (1967–1976) on the south bank of the Thames.  Its raw concrete and blockish form offended British traditionalists; [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] Prince Charles compared it with a nuclear power station.

In Belgium, a major figure was Charles Vandenhove (born 1927)  who constructed an important series of buildings for the University Hospital Center in [[Liege]].  His later work ventured into colorful rethinking of historical styles, such as Palladian architecture.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=162}}

In Finland, the most influential architect was [[Alvar Aalto]], who adapted his version of modernism to the Nordic landscape, light, and materials, particularly the use of wood. After World War II, he taught architecture in the United States. In Sweden, [[Arne Jacobsen]] was the best-known of the modernists, who designed furniture as well as carefully-proportioned buildings.

In Italy, the most prominent modernist was [[Gio Ponti]], who worked often with the structural engineer [[Pier Luigi Nervi]], a specialist in reinforced concrete.  Nervi created concrete beams of exceptional length, twenty-five meters, which allowed greater flexibility in forms and greater heights.  Their best-known design was the [[Pirelli Building]] in [[Milan]] (1958–1960), which for decades was the tallest building in Italy.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=164-165}}

The most famous Spanish modernist was the Catalan architect [[Josep Lluis Sert]], who worked with great success in Spain, France and the United States. In his early career he worked for a time under Le Corbusier, and designed the Spanish pavilion for the 1937 Paris Exposition. His notable later work included the [[Fondation Maeght]] in Saint-Paul-de-Provence, France (1964), and the [[Harvard Science Center]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served as Dean of Architecture at the [[Harvard School of Design]].

Notable German modernists included [[Johannes Krahn]], who played an important part in rebuilding German cities after World War II, and built several important museums and churches, notably [[St. Martin, Idstein]], which artfully combined stone masonry, concrete and glass.  Leading Austrian architects of the style included [[Gustav Peichl]], whose later works included the [[Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland|Art and Exhibition Center of the German Federal Republic]] in Bonn, Germany (1989).

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Brazil]] became a showcase of modern architecture in the late 1930s through the work of [[Lucio Costa]] (1902–1998) and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] (1907–2012).  Costa had the lead and Niemeyer collaborated on the Ministry of Education and Health in Rio de Janeiro (1936–43) and the Brazilian pavilion at the 1939 World's Fair in New York.  Following the war, Niemeyer, along with Le Corbusier, conceived the form of the [[United Nations Headquarters]] constructed by Walter Harrison.

Lucio Costa also had overall responsibility for the plan of the most audacious modernist project in Brazil;  the creation of a new capital, [[Brasilia]], constructed between 1956 and 1961.  Costa made the general plan, laid out in the form of a cross, with the major government buildings in the center.  Niemeyer was responsible for designing the government buildings, including the palace of the President;the National Assembly, composed of two towers for the two branches of the legislature and two meeting halls, one with a cupola and other with an inverted cupola. Niemeyer also built the cathedral, eighteen ministries, and giant blocks of housing, each designed for three thousand residents, each with its own school, shops, and chapel. Modernism was employed both as an architectural principle and as a guideline for organizing society, as explored in ''[[The Modernist City]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19722338|title=The modernist city : an anthropological critique of Brasília|last=James.|first=Holston,|date=1989|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226349794|location=Chicago|oclc=19722338}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following a military coup d'état in Brazil in 1964, Niemeyer moved to France, where he designed the modernist headquarters of the French Communist Party in Paris (1965–1980), a miniature of his United Nations plan.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=165-167}}

Mexico also had a prominent modernist movement.  Important figures included Félix Candela, born in Spain, who emigrated to Mexico in 1939, and participated in the construction of the new University of Mexico City;  he specialized in concrete structures in unusual parabolic forms. Another important figure was [[Mario Pani]], who designed the [[Conservatorio Nacional de Música (Mexico)|National Conservatory of Music]] in Mexico City (1949), and the [[Torre Insignia]] (1988). [[Augusto H. Alvarez]] designed the [[Torre Latinamericano]], one of the early modernist skyscrapers in Mexico City (1956);  it successfully withstood the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]], which destroyed many other buildings in the city center.  1964. [[Pedro Ramirez Vasquez]] and [[Rafael Mijares]]  designed the Olympic Stadium for the 1968 Olympics, and Antoni Peyri and Candela designed the Palace of Sports. [[Luis Barragan]] was another influential figure in Mexican modernism;  his raw concrete residence and studio in Mexico City looks like a blockhouse on the outside, while inside it features great simplicity in form, pure colors, abundant natural light, and, one of is signatures, a stairway without a railing.  He won the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] in 1980,  and the house was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=166}}

Japan, like Europe, had an enormous shortage of housing after the war, due to the bombing of many cities.  4.2 million housing units needed to be replaced.  Japanese architects combined both traditional and styles and techniques.  One of the foremost Japanese modernists was [[Kunio Maekawa]] (1905–1986), who had worked for Le Corbusier in Paris until 1930. His own house in Tokyo was an early landmark of Japanese modernism, combining traditional style with ideas he acquired working with Le Corbusier.  His notable buildings include concert halls in Tokyo and Kyoto and the International House of Japan in Tokyo, all in the pure modernist style.

[[Kenzo Tange]] (1913–2005) worked in the studio of Kunio Maekawa from 1938 until 1945 before opening his own architectural firm. His first major commission was the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]] .  He designed many notable office buildings and cultural centers. office buildings, as well as the [[Yoyogi National Gymnasium]] for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo.  The gymasim, built of concrete, features a roof suspended over the stadium on steel cables.

The Danish architect [[Jorn Utzon]] (1918-) worked briefly with [[Alvar Aalto]], studied the work of Le Corbusier, and traveled to the United States to meet [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].  In 1957 he designed one of the most recognizable modernist buildings in the world;  the [[Sydney Opera House]]..  He is known for the sculptural qualities of his buildings, and their relationship with the landscape. The five concrete shells of the structure resemble seashells by the beach.  Begun in 1957, the project encountered considerable technical difficulties making the shells and getting the acoustics right. Utzon resigned in 1966, and the opera house was not finished until 1973, ten years after its scheduled completion.  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=157}}

==Preservation==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Several works or collections of modern architecture have been designated by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Sites]]. In addition to the early experiments associated with Art Nouveau, these include a number of the structures mentioned above in this article: the [[Rietveld Schröder House]] in Utrecht, the [[Bauhaus]] structures in Weimar and Dessau, the [[Berlin Modernism Housing Estates]], the [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City of Tel Aviv]], the city of [[Asmara]], the city of [[Brasilia]], the [[Ciudad Universitaria]] of [[UNAM]] in Mexico City and the [[University City of Caracas]] in Venezuela, and the [[Sydney Opera House]].

Private organizations such as [[Docomomo International]], the [[World Monuments Fund]], and the Recent Past Preservation Network are working to safeguard and document imperiled Modern architecture. In 2006, the World Monuments Fund launched [[World Monuments Fund#Modernism at Risk|''Modernism at Risk'']], an advocacy and conservation program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15500">An '''official history''' is a work of [[history]] which is sponsored, authorised or endorsed by its subject. The term is most commonly used for histories which are produced for a government.{{sfn|MacIntyre|2001|loc=Official History}} The term also applies to commissions from non-state bodies as '''company histories''', i.e. histories of commercial [[Company|companies]]. An official [[biography]] (one written with the permission, cooperation and perhaps participation of its subject or the subject's heirs) is often known as an '''authorized biography'''.

Official histories frequently have the advantage that the author or authors have been given access to [[archive]]s, allowed to [[interview]] subjects and use other [[primary source]]s that would be closed to independent historians. Because of the necessarily close relationship between author and subject, such works may be (or be perceived to be) partisan in tone and to lack historical [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]]. Such [[bias]] varies and some official histories&lt;!--which ones?--&gt; are little more than exercises in [[public relations]] or [[propaganda]]; in other cases the authors have retained sufficient independence to be able to express negative as well as positive judgements about their subjects.

==Early official histories==

There is a long tradition of history being written or published under official [[patronage]]: they include, for example, the ''Anglica Historia'' (drafted by 1513 and published in 1534), a history of England written by [[Polydore Vergil]] at the request of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and [[William Camden]]'s ''Annales Rerum Gestarum Angliae et Hiberniae Regnate Elizabetha'' (1615–1627), a history of the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England]]. In [[early modern period|early modern]] Europe, certain [[Court (royal)|royal courts]] appointed official historians: these included the [[Historiographer Royal (Denmark)|Kongelig historiograf]] in the kingdom of [[Denmark–Norway]] from 1594, the [[Rikshistoriograf]] in [[Sweden]] from 1618, the [[Historiographer Royal (England)|Historiographer Royal]] in [[Kingdom of England|England]] from 1660 and the [[Historiographer Royal (Scotland)|Historiographer Royal]] in [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] from 1681; the Scottish post is still in existence. Each book in the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' records the official history of a [[Chinese history|Chinese dynasty]]. Sixteen of the histories were written between the 7th and 15th centuries. The first is ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', authored by [[Sima Qian]] in the [[Han Dynasty]] and the last is ''[[History of Ming]]'' in 1735. The official histories were compiled since the [[Tang Dynasty]] by a government office for historiography. They were revised and expanded over the course of a dynasty, up until the point that a final edition is published by the succeeding dynasty.{{sfn|Hartman|DeBlasi|2012|p=18}}

==Modern official histories==

The modern form of official history began in the mid-nineteenth century in reports written as military guides for later officers. The histories were detailed descriptions of events, not easy reading for a lay audience and left judgements to the discretion of a mainly professional readership. After the First World War, the New Zealand government decided that after a total war, its official histories should be written for a public who had fought in the war or supported the war effort. After the Second World War, the low academic standard of military education, especially in historical analysis, led to a view that professionally-trained historians should write official histories, applying their academic training to explain why as well as describe what. Since many of the academics had participated in the war, they could be expected to have experience of military service and knowledge of the war inform their writing. The contemporary view is that official history should incorporate the three points of view, containing the detailed description needed for works of military instruction but also to be suitable for a general readership and to show how participants tried to solve problems, drawing lessons from their successes and failures. None of the points of view to be served by the production of official history is immune to error, because work by a military historian might be fraudulent for personal or political reasons, distorting the record. Populist history can dilute the story to the point of worthlessness and civilian academics can be prone to select facts and interpretations according to ideals, ideology and preconceived ideas. {{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=9–10}}

Military histories written as textbooks might be thought to have a basis in truth, necessary to teach useful lessons to students. The British ''Report of the Committee on the Lessons of the Great War'' ([[Walter Kirke|Kirk Report]], 1931) drew on the published volumes of the British official history and the conclusions were incorporated into a new edition of ''Field Service Regulations''. That operations might be conducted in Iraq and Iran, led to official history volumes being produced against the objections of the Foreign Office. Military histories concentrated on the doings of national contingents, with only rare references to those of allied and opposing armies, since they had their own histories. Comparative analysis can be absent and national bias from ulterior motives, like mythologising and apologetics can also be found. The Australian ''[[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918]]'' edited by [[Charles Bean]] contains exaggerations of the significance of the Australian contribution, the prowess of Australian soldiers and disparagement of soldiers from Britain and its allies. Australian failures and casualties are sometimes blamed on British higher commanders, when high-ranking Australian officers could justly be criticised. The post-war [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was at risk of abolition and needed a function that could not be replicated by the army or navy to justify its existence. The parts of ''The War in the Air'' (six volumes and appendix, 1922–1937) written by [[Walter Raleigh (professor)|Walter Raleigh]] and Henry Jones, gave undue emphasis to strategic bombing, which unbalanced the work.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=9–10}}

Embarrassing events can be disguised by underwriting as happened in ''Histoire de La Grande Guerre'', where the [[French Army Mutinies]] of 1917 occurred in {{nowrap|43 percent}} of the French Army, yet were passed over in a few paragraphs in ''Les Armées Françaises dans la Grand Guerre''. Many of the historians, editors and contributors to the ''History of the Great War'' (1915–1949) had been senior officers during the war, which had the advantage first-hand knowledge of events and experience of military art for the work but this risked allowing a desire to protect reputations to intrude, leading to unfair blame, particularly on outsiders. Volume III of  the Royal Navy history ''Naval Operations'' (1923) had the narrative of the [[Battle of Jutland]] (1916) and the draft text was revised at the request of some serving officers present at the battle, to remove critical remarks about them. When a revised edition was published in 1940, many of the officers were retired or dead but the excised passages were not restored.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=10–11}} The British Army ''Military Operations....'' volumes have been criticised for dishonesty in not blaming [[General Headquarters]] (GHQ) for the extent of British casualties and for exculpating Sir [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]] (commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) from December 1915 to the Armistice). That the history is a description of events, rather than an analytical work with criticism and conclusions, means that Haig and other commanders may escape blame that is justly theirs, yet it also leaves the reader free to form conclusions.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=11–12}}

'''Patrick Weston Joyce''', commonly known as '''P.W. Joyce''' (1827 &amp;ndash; 7 January 1914) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] historian, writer and music collector, known particularly for his research in [[Irish language|Irish etymology]] and local place names of [[Ireland]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Ballyogan]] in the [[Ballyhoura Mountains]], on the borders of counties [[County Limerick|Limerick]] and [[County Cork|Cork]] in Ireland, and grew up in nearby Glenosheen. The family claimed descent from one [[Seán Mór Seoighe]] (fl. 1680), a stonemason from [[Connemara]], [[County Galway]]. 

[[Robert Dwyer Joyce]] was a younger brother. Joyce was a native Irish speaker who started his education at a [[hedge school]]. He then attended school in [[Mitchelstown]], County Cork.

Joyce started work in 1845 with the Commission of National Education. He became a teacher and principal of the Model School, [[Clonmel]]. In 1856 he was one of fifteen teachers selected to re-organize the national school system in Ireland. Meanwhile he earned his B.A. in 1861 and M.A. in 1863 from [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]], [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name=boy&gt;{{cite book|last=Boylan|first= Henry |year=1998|title=A Dictionary of Irish Biography, 3rd Edition|page=198|location=Dublin|publisher= Gill and MacMillan|ISBN = 0-7171-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was principal of the Training College, Marlborough Street, in [[Dublin]] from 1874 to 1893. As a member of the [[Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language]] he wrote an Irish Grammar in 1878. He was President of the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]] from 1906 to 1908, an association of which he was a member from 1865.&lt;ref name=boy/&gt; 

Joyce was a key cultural figure of his time. His wide interests included the [[Irish language]], [[Hiberno-English]], music, education, Irish literature and folklore, Irish history and antiquities, place-names and much else. He produced many works on the history and culture of Ireland. His most enduring work is the pioneering ''The Origin and History of Irish Names of Places'' (first edition published in 1869).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hogan, ed., ''Dictionary of Irish Literature'' (Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joyce collection in St. Patrick's College==
The P.W. Joyce collection at the Cregan Library in [[St. Patrick's College of Education (Drumcondra)|St Patrick's College, Drumcondra, Dublin]], reflects many of Joyce's interests and includes many rarities. These include autographed presentation copies by Joyce and his brother [[Robert Dwyer Joyce|Robert]], as well as books from Joyce's own library. The collection also contains nine manuscripts associated with Joyce and his family members, including a very fine manuscript in P.W. Joyce's own hand of ''Echtra Cormaic itir Tairngiri agus Ceart Claíd Cormaic'' (''Adventures of Cormac in the Land of Promise''), a passage from the ''[[Book of Ballymote]]'', which Joyce translated into English. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

[[File:SaidSis.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Rosemarie Said Zahlan and brother, [[Edward Said|Edward]], 1940]]
'''Rosemarie Said Zahlan''' ({{lang-ar|روزماري سعيد زحلان|Rawzimārī Saʿīd Zaḥlān}}) (August 20, 1937 - May 10, 2006) was a [[Palestinian Americans|Palestinian-American]] Christian historian and writer on the Persian Gulf states. She was a sister of [[Edward Said]]. In addition to her books, she also wrote for the [[Financial Times]], the [[Middle East Journal]], the [[International Journal of Middle East Studies]] and the [[Encyclopedia of Islam]].

Said Zahlan was born in [[Cairo]] in 1937, as the eldest of four sisters. Her father, Wadie Said, was a wealthy [[Anglican]] [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] businessman and a [[United States|US]] citizen, while her mother was born in [[Nazareth]] of Christian Lebanese and Palestinian descent.{{Citation needed|date= November 2012}} She  attended the women's college, [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]],  United States, where she took a degree in musicology.{{Citation needed|date= November 2012}} In a serious car accident her hands were injured and  several vertebrae broken. This made a musical career playing the piano impossible.{{Citation needed|date= November 2012}}

After Bryn Mawr, Rosemarie taught for a while in [[Cairo]]. She then went to [[Beirut]], where she lectured on cultural history and music at the [[American University of Beirut]] and the Beirut College for Women. After Beirut she went to [[London]] to get her [[PhD]] (about  the [[Red Sea]] route to India and its  18th-century history pioneer, [[George Baldwin (diplomat)|George Baldwin]]), at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]].

Said Zahlan married Tony Zahlan, a Palestinian physicist and academic from [[Haifa]]. Together they championed the Gaza Library Project for supplying books to Palestine. Said Zahlan was also a patron of the [[Palestine Solidarity Campaign]] in Britain, and, according to [[The Times]], her  "abiding concern throughout her life was for Palestine and the suffering of the Palestinian people."

'''Short shackling''' is a technique that [[United States|American]] [[interrogator]]s have been reported to use in the [[War on Terror]]. According to a military report the suspect's hands are [[shackle]]d to an [[eyebolt]] on the floor, so that the suspect is forced to lie in a [[fetal position]] or [[squatting position]].&lt;ref name="CSHRA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanrights.ucdavis.edu/projects/the-guantanamo-testimonials-project/testimonies/testimony-of-the-department-of-justice/observations-regarding-specific-techniques/b-prolonged-shackling-and-stress-positions|title=Prolonged Shackling and Stress Positions|publisher=[[The Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas]]|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the suspect's feet are also bound to the eyebolt, similar to [[Hogtie|hogtying]], but this has not been confirmed in any government reports. This [[interrogation]] technique can cause flesh wounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2753">The '''Sigma I-65 war game''' was one of a series of [[Classified information|classified]] high level [[Wargaming|war games]] played in [[The Pentagon]] during the 1960s to strategize the conduct of the burgeoning [[Vietnam War]]. These simulations were designed to replicate then-current conditions in [[Indochina]], with an aim toward predicting future foreign affairs events. They were staffed with high-ranking officials standing in to represent both domestic and foreign characters; stand-ins were chosen for their expertise concerning those they were called upon to represent. The games were supervised by a Control appointed to oversee both sides. The opposing Blue and Red Teams customary in war games were designated the friendly and enemy forces as was usual; however, several smaller teams were sometimes subsumed under Red and Blue Teams. Over the course of the games, the Red Team at times contained the Yellow Team for the [[People's Republic of China]], the Brown Team for the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], the Black Team for the [[Viet Cong]],&lt;ref name=allen193&gt;Allen, pp. 193-208.&lt;/ref&gt; and Green for the [[USSR]].&lt;ref name=gibbons17&gt;Gibbons, pp. 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparation for these simulations was quite extensive. A game staff of as many as 45 people researched and developed the scenarios. The actual play of the war game involved 30 to 35 participants. There are four or five simulations per year, solicited secretively from the [[State Department]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], and major military commands.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, pp. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sigma I-65==

While earlier Sigma War Games had considered whether U.S. combat troops should be committed to the [[Vietnam War]], Sigma I-65 was held just after [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] had landed in [[Danang]], [[Republic of South Vietnam]] on 8 March 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Shulimson, Johnson, pp. 7-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigma I-65 was held in May 1965. Players on both Blue and Red Teams were lower level officials, while higher ranking advisors set policy for their teams. Nothing more is yet known of this exercise.&lt;ref name=gibbons17/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6435">The earliest record of a '''Sumerian creation myth''',  called '''The Eridu Genesis''' by historian [[Thorkild Jacobsen]],&lt;ref name=Jacobsen&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thorkild Jacobsen|editor1-last=Hess|editor1-first=Richard S.|editor2-last=Tsumuro|editor2-first=David Toshio|title=I Studied Inscriptions from Before the Flood: Ancient Near Eastern Literary and Linguistic Approaches to Genesis|date=1994|publisher=Eisenbraun's|isbn=978-0931464881|page=129|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g5MGVP6gAPkC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Eridu+Genesis.+Nippur&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI4ImL2PiCxwIVhNWACh01nwD6#v=onepage&amp;q=Eridu%20Genesis.%20Nippur&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is found on a single fragmentary [[clay tablet|tablet]] excavated in [[Nippur]]. It is written in the [[Sumerian language]] and dated to around 1600 BC.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen"/&gt; Other [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] [[creation myths]] from around this date are called the [[Barton Cylinder]], the [[Debate between sheep and grain]] and the [[Debate between Winter and Summer]], also found at Nippur.&lt;ref name="Wasilewska2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ewa Wasilewska|title=Creation stories of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sMj1tyho3CoC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=23 May 2011|year=2000|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-85302-681-2|pages=146–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==

Where the tablet picks up, the gods [[An (mythology)|An]], [[Enlil]], [[Enki]] and [[Ninhursanga]] create the [[Sumer|black-headed people]] and create comfortable conditions for the animals to live and procreate. Then kingship descends from heaven and the first cities are founded: [[Eridu]], [[Bad-tibira]], [[Larak (Sumer)|Larak]], [[Sippar]], and [[Shuruppak]].

After a [[lacuna (manuscript)|missing section]] in the tablet, we learn that the gods have decided not to save mankind from an impending flood. [[Ziusudra|Zi-ud-sura]], the king and ''gudug'' priest, learns of this. In the later [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] version, [[Enki|Ea]], or Enki in Sumerian, the god of the waters, warns the hero ([[Atra-hasis]] in this case) and gives him instructions for the ark. This is missing in the Sumerian fragment, but a mention of Enki taking counsel with himself suggests that this is Enki's role in the Sumerian version as well.

== {{anchor|Sumerian flood myth}}Flood myth ==

When the tablet resumes, it is describing the flood. A terrible storm rocks the huge boat for seven days and seven nights, then [[Utu]] (the Sun god) appears and Zi-ud-sura creates an opening in the boat, prostrates himself, and sacrifices oxen and sheep.

After another break, the text resumes: the flood is apparently over, the animals disembark and [[Ziusudra|Zi-ud-sura]] prostrates himself before [[An (mythology)|An]] (sky-god) and [[Enlil]] (chief of the gods), who give him eternal life and take him to dwell in [[Dilmun]] for "preserving the animals and the seed of mankind". The remainder of the poem is lost.&lt;ref&gt;Black, J.A., Cunningham, G., Fluckiger-Hawker, E, [[Eleanor Robson|Robson, E.]], and Zólyomi, G. (1998) ''[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/ The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature]''. Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flood mythos possibly relates to a [[Sumerian floods|factual Sumerian flood]].

=== Legacy ===

Other [[flood myth]]s with many similarities to the Sumerian story are the story of the [[Dravida Kingdom|Dravida]] king Manu in the [[Matsya Purana]], the [[Utnapishtim]] episode in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and the [[Genesis flood narrative]] found in the [[Bible]]. The ancient Greeks have two similar myths from a later date: The [[Deucalion]] and Zeus' flooding of the world in Book I of [[Ovid]]'s [[Metamorphoses]].

== Ziusudra and Xisuthros ==

'''Zi-ud-sura''' is known to us from the following sources:

*From the Sumerian Flood myth discussed above.
*In reference to his immortality in some versions of ''The Death of Gilgamesh''&lt;ref&gt;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.8.1.3# Translation of versions of ''The Death of Gilgamesh''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Again in reference to his immortality in ''The Poem of Early Rulers''&lt;ref&gt;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.5.2.5# Translation of ''The Poem of Early Rulers''&lt;/ref&gt;
*As '''[[Xisuthros]]''' ('''{{lang|grc|Ξίσουθρος}}''') in [[Berossus]]' [[Hellenistic]] account of the Babylonian history
*As '''[[Ziusudra]]''' in the WB-62 recension of the [[Sumerian king list]]. This text diverges from all other extant king lists by listing the city of [[Shuruppak]] as a king, and including Ziusudra as "Shuruppak's" successor.&lt;ref&gt;George, A. R. (2003) ''The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, Critical Edition and Cuneiform Texts''. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
*A later version of a document known as ''The Instructions of Shuruppak''&lt;ref&gt;http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.5.6.1# Translation of ''The Instructions of Shuruppak''&lt;/ref&gt; refers to Ziusudra.&lt;ref&gt;Speculated by Samuel Noah Kramer as deriving from sources from as early as 2500 BC, Kramer concluded that "Ziusudra had become a venerable figure in literary tradition by the middle of the third millennium B.C." , (Samuel Noah Kramer "Reflections on the Mesopotamian Flood," ''Expedition'', 9, 4, (summer 1967), pp 12-18.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In both of the late-dated king lists cited above, the name Zi-ud-sura was inserted immediately before a flood event included in all versions of the [[Sumerian king list]], apparently creating a connection between the ancient [[Flood myth]] and a historic flood mentioned in the king list. However, no other king list mentions Zi-ud-sura.

[[Image:Sargentwyndhams.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Wyndham Sisters,'' by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1899 ([[Metropolitan Museum]])]]
'''The Souls''' were a small, loosely-knit but distinctive social group in [[United Kingdom|England]], from 1885 to the turn of the century. If their children are included, the group lasted up to about 1920. Their members included many of the most distinguished English politicians and intellectuals.

The group formed as a response to the damper on social life caused by the political tension of the [[Irish Government Bill 1886|Irish Home Rule]] debate. Existing social circles were rent by angry arguments between proponents and opponents of the [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] ministry's efforts in 1886 to bring about full [[Home Rule]]. Many people in society wanted a [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] where they could meet without fighting about politics. [[Wilfrid Scawen Blunt]] was a member of the group and gave a good, general description of the aims and objectives of its members, and above all, what they wanted to avoid.&lt;blockquote&gt;In my disappointment about Egypt I turned with redoubled zest to my social pleasures of the year before, and at this time saw much of that interesting group of clever men and pretty women known as the Souls, than whom no section of London Society was better worth frequenting, including as it did all that there was most intellectually amusing and least conventional. It was a group of men and women bent on pleasure, but pleasure of a superior kind, eschewing the vulgarities of racing and card-playing indulged in by the majority of the rich and noble, and looking for their excitement in romance and sentiment.&lt;ref&gt; Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, ''My Diaries; Being a Personal Narrative of Events 1888–1914''. Part One: 1888–1900 (New York: Knopf, 1923), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The name of the group was bestowed by [[Lord Charles Beresford]], who is quoted as having said: "You all sit and talk about each other's souls — I shall call you the 'Souls'".

Among the original Souls were:
* [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston]]
* [[Arthur Balfour]]
* [[Margot Asquith]]
* [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|St. John Brodrick]]
* [[Hugo Charteris, 11th Earl of Wemyss|Hugo Charteris, Lord Elcho]]
* [[Mary Constance Wyndham|Mary Charteris, Lady Elcho]]
* [[Alfred Lyttelton]]
* [[Percy Wyndham (1835–1911)|Percy Wyndham]]
* Madeline Wyndham
* [[George Wyndham]]
* [[Henry Cust|Henry 'Harry' Cust]]
* Emmeline 'Nina' Cust
* [[William Grenfell, 1st Baron Desborough]]
* [[Ethel Fane|Ethel 'Ettie' Grenfell, Lady Desborough]]&lt;ref name=soul&gt;{{cite news|title=Revelations of Ettie Desborough, an Edwardian A-lister|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1041844/Revelations-Ettie-Desborough--Edwardian-A-lister.html|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=Mail OnLine|date=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth]]
* Alberta 'Gay' Windsor-Clive, Lady Windsor
* [[Henry White (diplomat)|Henry White]], the U.S. diplomat
* [[Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland]], and her daughter by Cust, [[Lady Diana Cooper|Diana]]

Also prominent in The Souls were the five Wyndhams (children of [[Percy Wyndham (1835–1911)|Percy Wyndham]]): [[George Wyndham|George]], a politician and writer; [[Guy Percy Wyndham|Guy Percy]], a soldier; Madeline, who married [[Charles Adeane]]; [[Mary Constance Wyndham|Mary]], who married [[Hugo Charteris, 11th Earl of Wemyss|Lord Elcho]]; and Pamela, who married [[Edward Tennant, 1st Baron Glenconner|Edward Tennant]], Margot Asquith's brother. [[John Singer Sargent]] painted a joint portrait of the three Wyndham sisters, as well as an individual portrait of Henry White's wife, Margaret.

This original group of Souls reached its zenith in the early 1890s, and had faded out as a coherent clique by 1900.

==The Coterie==
{{main|The Coterie}}
[[The Coterie]] was often considered as the second generation of The Souls. They were a mix of aristocrats, politicians and art-lovers. They were patrons of artists of the time, including [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James Whistler]].

|quote= Battle of Sarmizegetusa (Sarmizegetuza), A.D. 105. During Trajan's reign one of the most important Roman successes was the victory over the Dacians. The first important confrontation between the Romans and the Dacians took place in the year 87 and was initiated by Domitian. The [[praetorian prefect]] [[Cornelius Fuscus|Cornelius]] led five or six legions across the Danube on a bridge of ships and advanced towards [[Banat]] (in Romania). The Romans were surprised by a Dacian attack at Tapae (near the village of [[Bucova]], in Romania). Legion V Alaude was crushed and Cornelius Fuscus was killed. The victorious general was originally known as [[Diurpaneus]] (see Manea, p.109), but after this victory he was called Decebalus (the brave one).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The [[Roman legion]]s are ambushed at [[Tapae]] and face disaster with complete destruction of [[Legio V Alaudae]] (see [[First Battle of Tapae]]){{sfn|Jones|1992|p=141}}
** Cornelius Fuscus dies in the battle{{sfn|MacKendrick|2000|p=217}}, the [[Aquila (Roman)|battle standard]] of the Praetorian Guard is lost and the Dacians capture Roman flags and war machines{{sfn|Jones|1992|p=141}}
** [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] must pay [[tribute]] to the [[Dacians]] in exchange for a vague recognition of Rome's importance.
** King Duras knowingly offers the kingship to [[Diurpaneus]] as a recognition of his diplomatic, military and leadership skills
** Diurpaneus dubbs himself [[Decebalus]], meaning "with the strength of ten [men]"&lt;ref&gt;"Decebalus" means "strong as ten [men]" (cf. [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''daśabala''); ''Dece-'' being derived from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*dekm-'' ('ten') and ''-balus'' from PIE ''*bel-'', 'strong'. Cf. [[Albanian language|Proto-Albanian]] ''*dek(a)t-'', from PIE ''*dekm-'' (Demiraj, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "The Brave,"&lt;ref name="Romanis REquote01" /&gt; and is crowned king of Dacia
* 88 AD
** The Roman offensive into Dacia continues, with general [[Tettius Iulianus]] in command{{sfn|Jones|1992|p=142}}
** The army starts from [[Viminacium]] following the same route Cornelius Fuscus had in the previous year and heads towards [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]], the capital of Dacia{{sfn|Jones|1992|p=142}}
** In Rome, Domitian celebrates the [[Secular Games]] and possibly plans a trip to the Danube to accept Dacians' surrender in person{{sfn|Jones|1992|p=142}}
** Late 88, a battle takes place mainly in the same area, at [[Tapae]], and this time the Romans are victorious{{sfn|Jones|1992|p=142}}
** Facing a difficult road to [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]] and for fear of falling into a trap, Iulianus abandons the offensive&lt;ref name="Romanis REquote01" /&gt;
** Decebalus sues for peace but Domitian refuses&lt;ref name="Romanis REquote01" /&gt;
* 89 AD
** Domitian attacks the Germanic [[Suebi]] tribes of [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]], possibly as a punitive action since the [[Germanics]] did not provide assistance in the Dacian conflict{{sfn|Jones|1992|p=151}}
** After [[Marcomanni]] defeat the Romans in [[Pannonia]] and Rome faces wars on two fronts, Domitian comes in person to the [[Danube]] and accepts the peace with the Dacians{{sfn|Jones|1992|pp=150-151}}
** Later in the year, Decebalus sends [[Diegis]], general, member of the Dacian royal family and brother of Decebalus{{sfn|Martial|100 AD|loc=5.3}}, to Rome{{sfn|Martial|100 AD|loc=5.3}} to accept the [[diadem]] from Domitian and the generous settlement{{sfn|Jones|1992|pp=150-151}}
** Decebalus becomes a [[client state|client king]] of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], he receives money, [[Artisan|craftsmen]]{{sfn|Jones|1992|p=150}} and [[Siege engine|war machines]] to protect the empire's borders
** For Domitians' achievements in Dacia, the [[Roman Senate]] decrees a huge equestrian statue, impressive games take places and throughout the empire statues are erected{{sfn|Jones|1992|p=151}}
* after 89 AD
** Instead of using the money as Rome intended, Decebalus builds [[Dacian Fortresses of the Orăștie Mountains|new citadels in the mountains]], in important strategic points, and reinforces the existing ones.
* 92 AD
** A coalition of [[Dacians]] and [[Rhoxolani]] Sarmatians completely slaughter the [[Legio XXI Rapax|Legio XXI ''Rapax'']] at [[Tropaeum Traiani]], modern [[Romania]], in the [[Battle of Adamclisi (92 AD)|First Battle of Adamclisi]]
** Angustia diploma{{sfn|MacKendrick|2000|p=217}}
* 96 AD – In September, Domitian is assassinated, one potential reason being the unfavorable peace with [[Decebalus]]

== End of ancient history in Romania ==
The date used as the end of the ancient era is entirely arbitrary. Not all historians agree on the ending dates of ancient history, which frequently falls somewhere in the 5th, 6th, or 7th century. [[Western culture|Western]] scholars usually date the end of ancient history with the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]] in AD 476, the death of the emperor [[Justinian I]] in AD 565, or the [[coming of Islam]] in AD 632 as the end of [[Classical Antiquity|ancient European history]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5265">'''Trauma risk management''' (TRiM) is a method of secondary [[PTSD]] (and other traumatic stress related mental health disorders) prevention. The TRiM process enables non-healthcare staff to monitor and manage colleagues. TRiM training provides TRiM Practitioners with a background understanding of psychological trauma and its effects.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg N, Brooks S, Dunn R - "Latest developments in post-traumatic stress disorder: diagnosis and treatment" - British Medical Bulletin. April 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

TRiM is a trauma-focused peer support system&lt;ref&gt;Creamer MC, Varker T, Bisson J, Darte K, Greenberg N, Lau W, Moreton G, O’Donnell M, Richardson D, Ruzek J, Watson P, Forbes D - "Guidelines for peer support in high risk organizations: An international consensus study using the Delphi method" – Journal of Traumatic Stress, April 2012, 25, 134–141&lt;/ref&gt; and the way it works is wholly compliant with the PTSD management guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Care and Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Guidance for employers on promoting mental wellbeing through productive and healthy working conditions. NICE Public Health Guidance no.22. London: NICE, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma risk management Practitioners are trained to carry out an interview which identifies a number of risk factors which, when present, increase the likelihood that an individual may suffer poor longer term mental health as a result of a traumatic event. The initial TRiM interview takes place with an individual, 72 hours after a traumatic incident. People who score highly on this initial interview are provided with extra support by colleagues, and where appropriate, line managers. A follow up TRiM interview is then carried out approximately one month later to assess how well people have come to terms with the traumatic event at that point. Individuals who are found to have persistent difficulties at this point are encouraged and assisted to seek a professional assessment in order to access any specific treatment they require.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg N, Brooks S, Dunn R - "Latest developments in post-traumatic stress disorder: diagnosis and treatment" - British Medical Bulletin. April 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

TRiM originated within the [[UK military]] after previously-used reactive single session models of post incident intervention, such as [[Critical Incident Stress Debriefing]], were subject to scientific scrutiny and shown to not just lack effectiveness but also have the potential to do harm.&lt;ref&gt;Rose SC, Bisson J, Wessely S. "Psychological debriefing for preventing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)". Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2002, Issue 2. Article Number CD000560, DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000560&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Neil Greenberg]] was one of the team at the forefront of developing peer-led traumatic stress support packages, now known as TRiM. He is an academic psychiatrist based at [[King's College London]] UK and is a consultant occupational and forensic psychiatrist.

Although it was first developed in the UK military, trauma risk management is now used by a range of public and commercial organisations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marchonstress.com/page/p/clients&lt;/ref&gt; This includes charities, emergency services, security firms, risk management organisations, UK Government departments including the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/35492/0392-12attachment2of2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the oil and gas industry, transport organisations and media companies including the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/safety/health/trauma-support&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence and research==
A large number of research papers have been published about the use of TRiM and its effectiveness and acceptance. This includes research about the use of TRiM by Cumbria Constabulary, following the Cumbria shootings in 2010. This research&lt;ref&gt;Hunt E, Jones N, Hastings V, Greenberg N. – "TRiM: an organizational response to traumatic events in Cumbria Constabulary"- Occup Med (Lond) 2013 Dec;63(8):549-55&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the officers and staff who received a TRiM response fared better than their colleagues who did not and were less likely to be absent from work than colleagues who did not receive a TRiM intervention.

Research has shown that the use of TRiM may assist in increasing the psychological resilience of military personnel through the facilitation of social support.&lt;ref&gt;Frappell-Cooke W, Gulina M, Green K, Hacker Hughes J, Greenberg N, "Does trauma risk management reduce psychological distress in deployed troops?" - Occupational Medicine Journal, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent research into TRiM came in a review paper, published in the Journal of Occupational Medicine in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Whybrow, D, Jones, N, Greenberg, N. "Promoting organizational well-being: a comprehensive review of Trauma Risk Management" – Journal of Occupational Medicine, 16 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tønnesminde''' is the site of an archaeological excavation ground and present day organic farm on the island of [[Samsø]], [[Denmark]]. Archaeological evidence attests the area around Tønnesminde has a long history of human occupation, dating from approximately 4000 BC to present day. Recent excavations suggest that Tønnesminde contains settlements dating from the [[Funnelbeaker culture]] in the [[Neolithic|Early Neolithic]] period, [[Nordic Bronze Age|Early Bronze Age]], [[Pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe|Pre-Roman Iron Age]], and [[Viking Age]].

__TOC__

==Excavations==
===1999===
Excavations began at Tønnesminde when the [[National Museum of Denmark|Danish National Museum]] investigated a 500 m² area northwest of the farm in preparation for sewage pipeline construction in 1999.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sørensen, P. Ø. 1999: Beretning for arkæologisk udgravning ved Tønnesminde, Tranebjerg sogn, Samsø herred, Holbæk amt. Matr. 26a. Stednr. 030505 sb. 96. NM I 8139/00-1. Danmarks Oldtid, Nationalmuseet.&lt;/ref&gt;Archaeologists excavated the remains of a house, four large pits, a fence, a [[cultural layer]], and a few [[posthole]]s. Finds included [[Flint|flint flakes]], a fishing net anchor ("netsynk"), and [[ceramics]].

=== 2010 ===
Interest in the Tønnesminde area resumed in 2010 with a metal detector survey launched by [[Moesgård Museum|Moesgaard Museum]] and Sams[[Samsø|ø]] Museum in the hopes of learning more about Viking Age military establishments on Samsø and finding sites for additional excavations. The survey has increased the number of metal artifacts from the island, changed the conception of Samsø's settlement history, particularly in regards to the Iron Age, and renewed interest in Tønnesminde.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=FORSKNINGSSTRATEGI MOESGAARD MUSEUM ARKÆOLOGI|last=|first=|date=2016|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2014 ===
After the rediscovery of the site by the metal detector campaign, excavations resumed at Tønnesminde in 2014 as a joint investigation between [[Moesgård Museum|Moesgaard Museum]] and [[Harvard Summer School]] Viking Studies Program. A trial excavation composed of five trial trenches began at Tønnesminde  on March 24, 2014 and revealed remains from [[Pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe|Pre-Roman Iron Age]] and [[Viking Age|Viking]] Age settlements.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Trier, T. 2014: Archaeological Excavation Report for FHM 5216 Tønnesminde, Brundby By, Tranebjerg sogn, Samsø herred, tidl. Århus og Holbæk amt. Sted nr. 03.05.05. Sb.nr. 138. Moesgaard Museum. Højbjerg.&lt;/ref&gt;In June and July 2014, archaeologists from Moesgaard Museum and [[Aarhus University]] as well as students from Harvard excavated three separate trenches, totaling an area of 1100 m², and examined four [[Pit-house|pit houses]], one three-aisled [[Longhouse|long house]], and numerous pits and postholes. Several of the postholes suggested the previous presence of a fence and a small structure. A fifth pit house was discovered but not excavated, and a [[Trial trenching|trial trench]] suggested it could be the remains of a burnt house.

Finds included animal bones, charcoal, pottery, beads, flint debris, an [[arrowhead]], and items typical of Viking Age pit houses, which includes but is not limited to loom weights, spindle whorls,  fragments of soap stone vessel, pottery shards, and glass beads. The investigation additionally discovered circular crop marks nearby, which could constitute [[ring ditch]]es around graves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===2015===
Excavations at Tønnesminde the following summer represented a continuation of the 2014 excavation. Archaeologists excavated approximately 1150 m² in two new separate areas and investigated four pit houses and several pits and postholes. 

Three of the pit houses may provide evidence of textile production because of the discovery of [[spindle whorl]]s and [[Warp-weighted loom|loom weights]].

The fourth pit house featured large amounts of charcoal, [[Slag|iron slag]], iron nails and rivets, [[hammerscale]], and multiple [[Sharpening stone|whetstones]], leading to the conclusion that the pit house may have operated as a [[Forge|smithy]]. Additional finds included other usual Viking Age items, ceramic fragments, flint debris and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], and animal bones.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Trier, T. 2015: Archaeological Excavation Report for FHM 5216 Tønnesminde, Brundby By, Tranebjerg sogn, Samsø herred, tidl. Århus og Holbæk amt. Sted nr. 03.05.05. Sb.nr. 138. Moesgaard Museum. Højbjerg.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 ===
During the 2016 excavations at Tonnesminde, archaeologists studied a Late Iron Age or Early Viking Age long house, several [[cooking pits]], a large cultural layer, and many pits and postholes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.samsoposten.dk|title=Økonomibygning fra vikingetid fundet|last=Øster-Mortensen|first=Jens|date=1 July 2016|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finds included bone fragments, ceramics, flint flakes and scrapers, charcoal and grain (collected from flotation samples).

=== 2017 ===

The 2017 excavation covered an area of 1200m2 containing three Viking Age pit houses of varying depths, as well as two cooking pits and over one hundred postholes. Finds included worked pieces of flint from the Stone Age, two spindle whorls, a small piece of amber, and a wide array of ceramic pieces, several of which were rim sherds from the Viking Age. Many bones, including a large jawbone with one tooth attached to it, were found in one of the pit houses, pit C-14. The same pit house contained layers of burnt, red clay in the northern side of the unit, suggesting that the pit house or at least remnants of it was burned down after its destruction.

The initial excavation of Tønnesminde in 1999 revealed flint flakes from polished axes, possibly from the [[Funnelbeaker culture|Funnel Beaker Culture]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 2014 and 2015 excavations also found flint flakes, including an arrow head, which again indicates settlement during the late Mesolithic or Early Neolithic period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The 2016 excavation additionally discovered flint scrapers and flakes, as well as ceramic fragments, the patterns of which suggest they were created by the Funnel Beaker Culture. A decorated ceramic shard and several flint tools found during the 2017 excavation have been attributed to the Early Neolithic period.

=== Bronze Age  ===
{{main|Nordic Bronze Age}}
The 1999 excavation found potential house remnants, which the archaeologists dated to the [[Neolithic|late Neolithic]] period or early Bronze Age because of its proximity to cultural layers containing artifacts likely from the early Bronze Age, namely, a [[Stone tool|stone axe]] and a ceramic rim shard. The largely undated flint flakes discovered in the 2014, 2015, and 2016 excavations also could indicate habitation of Tønnesminde during the early Bronze Age.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Pre-Roman Iron Age  ===
{{main|Nordic Iron Age}}
The excavation in 1999 investigated several pits cautiously attributed to the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe|Pre-Roman Iron Age]] based on ceramics characteristic of this period. The pits also contained flint flakes, but because the flint collection likely contained older pieces, they were difficult to date.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 2014 investigation of a three aisle long house revealed pottery shards likely from the Pre-Roman Iron Age in one of its roof-bearing posts, as well as in several pits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 2015 excavation examined a feature, interpreted as a cooking pit, which contained a significant amount of ceramics dated to the Pre-Roman Iron Age.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Viking Age  ===
{{main|Viking Age}}
While the investigation in 1999 did not reveal any Viking Age artifacts, subsequent excavations at Tønnesminde have found significant evidence of a Viking Age settlement. The 2014 excavation unearthed [[spindle whorl]]s, glass beads, [[loom weights]], [[Sharpening stone|whetstones]], iron rivets, and iron knives in presumably Viking Age pit houses. Nearby postholes likely belong to other Viking Age buildings, although the postholes lacked dateable material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, the 2015 excavation found spindle whorls, loom weights, iron rivets and nails, and whetstones from pit houses; other excavated postholes probably derive from the Viking Age but could not be dated due to a dearth of dateable material.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The long house excavated by the 2016 team could have functioned as an 'economy house' ('økonomibygning' in Danish) during the Viking Age.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; An older, nearby large cultural layer intersects the long house, and based on the discovery of half of a loom weight and the general structure of the long house, on-site archaeologists dated the long house to the Late Iron Age or Early Viking Age. Similarly, the 2017 excavation unearthed two spindle whorls and many ceramic rim shards that are characteristic of the Viking Age.

== Significance ==

=== Handicraft production ===
Using the artifacts recovered by the 2014-2016 excavations, archaeologists hope to better understand Viking Age activity on Samsø, particularly craft production. The pit houses investigated in 2014 and 2015 show evidence of textile production. Textiles can reflect both long-distance trading networks and daily needs, such as bedding, packing material, sails, and other products.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Viking Age textiles|last=Larsson|first=Annika|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=0-203-41277-X|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more information from Tønnesminde, it may be possible to connect textile production at Tønnesminde with, for example, the Kanhave Canal and the likely fleet stationed there during the Viking Age. Perhaps the textiles were used to repair Viking Age sails, replace clothing, or trade.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Whetstone and spindle whorl.png|thumb|right|Whetstone and spindle whorl found in a pit house during the 2014 excavation]] --&gt;
A pit house investigated in 2015 was identified as a Viking Age smithy. Because of the accessibility of ore, remains from smithing can be found throughout Scandinavia, and smithing a common metal craft rather than a trade reserved for specialists.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Smithing occurred in both rural farms and towns,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; so further investigation of Tønnesminde is needed to categorize the settlement. Nevertheless, the presence of the smithy provides more information about handicraft production on Samsø and helps place Samsø within the broader context of Viking Age Scandinavian settlements.
{{clear left}}
Evidence of handicraft production is further strengthened by the 2017 excavation, which revealed two spindle whorls in one of the pit houses, C15, one of which is intact. The absence of any other significant artifacts in that pit house strongly suggests that the feature has been exclusively used for textile production purposes.

=== Viking Age trade ===
[[File:Kanhave Canal 2016.jpg|alt=Ship in canal|thumb|upright|The Kanhave Canal in 2016 with a full-scale model of a Viking Age ship and a reconstruction of a part of [[Bulwarks|the bulwark]].]]
The excavations at Tønnesminde will greatly add to current knowledge about Samsø and Viking Age trade.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Kanhave Canal]], which has been dated, using [[dendrochronology]], to 726 CE (before the beginning of the Viking Age) based on the wood used for its construction, indicates the importance of the island in the Viking Age, since construction of the 500m canal would have required centralized planning, extensive manual labor, and significant funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortidsmindeguide.dk/Kanhave-Kanal.vt005.0.html|title=Fortidsminder - Guiden til fortidsminder: Kanhave Kanal|website=fortidsmindeguide.dk|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given Samsø's central location, the canal would have enabled a fleet to control ship traffic through Danish waters and better levy taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/en_GB/the-kanhave-canal|title=The Kanhave Canal,  Built by a powerful king  - 1001 Stories of Denmark|website=www.kulturarv.dk|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitsamsoe.dk/en/inspiration/samsoes-historie/|title=The History of Samsø - VisitSamsoe.dk|language=English|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Kanhave Canal indicates a Viking Age presence on the island, the lack of additional Viking Age evidence does not allow characterization of this presence.

Around the time of the construction of the Kanhave Canal, Scandinavia focused increasingly on trade, cultural contacts, and warfare with neighboring areas; these changes affected craft production as craftsmen and their creations became more important.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handicrafts|last=Ljungkvist|first=John|publisher=Routledge Worlds|year=2008|isbn=0415692628|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=Why and in what way did they become "more important"?|date=August 2016}} Indeed, other Scandinavian sites demonstrate extensive long-distance exchange, far more than elsewhere in northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Local and long-distance exchange|last=Sindbæk|first=Søren Michael|publisher=Routledge Worlds|year=2008|isbn=0415692628|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=What does "northern Europe" means in this context? Is it Europe north of the Alps? Does it include The British Isles? What?|date=August 2016}} As one of the few excavations on Samsø, Tønnesminde has added greatly to knowledge of Viking Age trade on the island.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The work houses at Tønnesminde could be connected to this expanding trade and the central location of Samsø. Part of a Norwegian soapstone vessel, found by the 2015 team, provides evidence of trade at Viking Age Tønnesminde.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Norway is particularly known for soapstone quarries, and soapstone vessels have been found throughout Scandinavia as trade increased.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The whetstones found by the 2014 and 2015 teams provide further evidence for craft production and possible subsequent trade at Tønnesminde, as whetstones were another trade item increasingly produced during the Viking Age.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Supplementing the Norwegian soapstone vessel find, the 2017 excavation revealed an almost perfectly round [[Slate|slate]] dish in the pit house C-14, . The absence of [[Slate|slate]] in Denmark implies that the dish must have been imported either from Norway or Sweden. The presence of soapstone on the site suggests that the dish was indeed imported from Norway, further adding to the evidence of trade at Tønnesminde.

'''Ursula Moser Cowgill''' (9 November 1927 – November 27, 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite linked authority file|id=n89-146741|text=Full name and date of birth|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/ursula-cowgill-obituary?pid=177862601&amp;view=guestbook}}{{|text=Date of death}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[biologist]] and [[anthropologist]] who worked for [[Yale University]], [[Dow Chemical Company]] and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] during the second half of the 20th century. Her work includes studies of [[Agriculture in Mesoamerica|agricultural practices in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica]], seasons of [[birth]] in human beings, the relationship between cultural [[sexism|gender bias]] and [[infant mortality]], and the possible role of [[selenium]] in reducing [[death|mortality]] from [[AIDS]]. She also looked after four [[potto]]s for many years and published a series of observations on their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=ursula-moser-cowgill&amp;pid=177862601|title=Ursula Moser Cowgill's Obituary|website=New York Times|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowgill earned a [[PhD]] from [[Iowa State University]] in 1956. Later she worked as an analytical chemist for the [[limnologist]] [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]].  Her first journal articles, some published jointly with Hutchinson, appeared in the early 1960s.

Cowgill was living in [[Colorado]] as of 2003. In addition to her scientific research, she was an activist with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].

==Work and findings==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}

===Pottos===
In 1959, three pairs of pottos from West Africa arrived at Yale's Osborn Zoological Laboratory. At first they lived in the laboratory with a number of other [[nocturnal]] [[prosimian]]s that Cowgill and Hutchinson were studying. In 1964, Cowgill took two of the pairs to live with her. She looked after them until 1981, when she gave the sole surviving male to a colleague.

While the pottos were with her, Cowgill published a number of journal articles on their anatomy, diet, reproduction, illnesses and recovery, and social behaviour. These publications constitute one of the few long-term studies of pottos in captivity.

===Maya agriculture===
Between 1961 and 1963, Cowgill and Hutchinson made studies of [[soil]] in the  [[Petén Basin]], [[Guatemala]], with the aim of learning about the effects of [[agriculture|agricultural]] practices of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]]. Their findings reported that Maya cultivation methods had gradually robbed the soil of vital elements, meaning that it eventually became unable to sustain crops. Some scholars have linked this exhaustion of the soil to the 10th century decline of the Maya urban settlements in the Petén region.

===Sex ratio and childhood mortality===
Cowgill's research into gender and child mortality covered both historical records in [[England]] and contemporary observations in [[Guatemala]]. Using birth and death records from the parish registers of [[York]] between 1538 and 1812, Cowgill found that throughout the city's history, girls at every stage of childhood had died at a higher rate than boys of the same age. This resulted in an adult [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] of 136 males for every 100 females. Cowgill theorised that this was partly because girls were more likely to be victims of [[infanticide]], and partly because sons tended to receive better feeding and care than daughters.

In [[Guatemala]], Cowgill studied an indigenous village where the sex ratio was even more skewed—178:100. Cowgill observed that mothers in this village [[breastfeeding|breastfed]] sons for much longer than daughters, and tended to give them preferential treatment even after weaning. Cowgill and Hutchinson also speculated that the sexually provocative behaviour of young girls in this village might be a [[survival mechanism]].

===Seasons of birth===

Cowgill undertook one of the first scientific studies of seasonality in human reproduction. Taking data from historical records and indigenous peoples in various countries, she concluded that conception and birth in human beings, like that of many other animals, followed seasonal patterns to a degree. Because the pattern was different in the [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]]s, Cowgill hypothesised that [[weather]] was the determining factor. However, she found that in [[urbanisation|urbanised]] and [[industrialisation|industrialised]] areas the pattern had been disrupted. Her 1966 article on the topic, published in the journal ''Ecology'', has formed the basis for subsequent research by other scientists.

===Selenium and AIDS===

In 1997, Cowgill gauged the selenium content of soil in various locations in the [[United States]] by measuring the amount of the mineral that was absorbed by [[alfalfa]]. She then correlated this information with the mortality rate of [[AIDS]] in the area. She found that the more selenium there was in the soil, the lower mortality from AIDS was. The relationship was especially strong among [[African-Americans]].

[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|300px|A late version of a Watt [[double-acting cylinder|double-acting]] [[steam engine]],  built by [[D. Napier &amp; Son]] (London) in 1859, now in the lobby of the Superior Technical School of Industrial Engineers of the [[Technical University of Madrid|UPM]] ([[Madrid]]). Steam engines of this kind propelled the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Great Britain and the world.]]

The '''Watt steam engine''', alternatively known as the '''Boulton and Watt steam engine''', was the first practical [[steam engine]] and was one of the driving forces of the [[industrial revolution]]. [[James Watt]] developed the design sporadically from 1763 to 1775 with support from [[Matthew Boulton]], Watt's design saved so much on fuel costs compared to earlier designs that they were licenced based on the amount of fuel they would save. Watt never ceased developing the steam engine, introducing double-acting designs (with two cylinders) and various systems for taking off rotary power. Watt's design became synonymous with steam engines, and it was many years before significantly new designs began to replace the basic Watt design.

The [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|first steam engine]]s, introduced by [[Thomas Newcomen]] in 1712, was of the "atmospheric" design. Steam was introduced into a cylinder which was then cooled by a spray of water. This caused the steam to condense, forming a [[partial vacuum]] in the cylinder. Atmospheric pressure on the top pushed the piston down. Watt noticed that the water spray also cooled the cylinder itself, and it required significant amounts of heat to warm it back up to the point where steam could enter the cylinder without immediately condensing again. Watt addressed this by adding a separate water-filled cylinder which was opened once the main cylinder was filled. The steam entered the secondary cylinder and condensed, drawing remaining steam from the main cylinder to continue the process. The end result was the same cycle as Newcomen's design, but without any cooling of the main cylinder which was immediately ready for another stroke. Watt worked on the design over a period of several years, introducing the condenser and improvements to practically every part of the design, notably a lengthy series of trials on ways to seal the piston in the cylinder. All of these changes produced a more reliable design which used half as much coal to produce the same amount of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The new design was introduced commercially in 1776, with the first example sold to the [[Carron Company]] ironworks. Watt continued working to improve the engine, and in 1781 introduced a system using a [[sun and planet gear]] to turn the linear motion of the engines into rotary motion. This made it useful not only in the original pumping role, but also as a direct replacement in roles where a [[water wheel]] would have been used previously. This was a key moment in the industrial revolution, which could now be located anywhere instead of previously needing a suitable water source and topology. Boulton began developing a multitude of machines that made use of this rotary power, developing the first modern industrialized factory, the [[Soho Foundry]], which in turn produced new steam engine designs. Watt's early engines were like the original Newcomen designs in that they used low-pressure steam and most of the action was caused by atmospheric pressure, due mostly to safety concerns.&lt;ref name="Dickinson"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Looking to improve on their performance, Watt began considering the use of higher-pressure steam, as well as designs using multiple cylinders in both the double-acting concept and the multiple-expansion concept. These required the invention of the [[parallel motion]], which allowed the [[piston rod]]s of the individual cylinders to move in straight lines.

==Introduction==
In 1698, the English mechanical designer [[Thomas Savery]] invented a pumping appliance that used steam to draw water directly from a well by means of a vacuum created by condensing steam. The appliance was also proposed for draining [[Mining|mines]], but it could only draw fluid up approximately 25 feet, meaning it had to be located within this distance of the mine floor being drained. As mines became deeper, this was often impractical. It also consumed a large amount of fuel compared with later engines.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Rosen|year-2012|pp"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2012|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newcomen steam engine.jpg|thumb|upleft|The model [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen engine]] upon which Watt experimented]]
The solution to draining deep mines was found by [[Thomas Newcomen]] who developed an [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|"atmospheric" engine]] that also worked on the vacuum principle. It employed a cylinder containing a movable piston connected by a chain to one end of a rocking beam that worked a mechanical lift pump from its opposite end. At the bottom of each stroke, steam was allowed to enter the cylinder below the piston. As the piston rose within the cylinder, drawn upward by a counterbalance, it drew in steam at atmospheric pressure. At the top of the stroke the steam valve was closed, and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam. This water condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum below the piston. The atmospheric pressure outside the engine was then greater than the pressure within the cylinder, thereby pushing the piston into the cylinder. The piston, attached to a chain and in turn attached to one end of the "rocking beam", pulled down the end of the beam, lifting the opposite end of the beam. Hence, the pump deep in the mine attached to opposite end of the beam via ropes and chains was driven. The pump pushed, rather than pulled the column of water upward, hence it could lift water any distance. Once the piston was at the bottom, the cycle repeated.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Rosen|year-2012|pp"/&gt;

The Newcomen engine was more powerful than the Savery engine. For the first time water could be raised from a depth of over 150 feet. The first example from 1712 was able to replace a team of 500 horses that had been used to pump out the mine.  Seventy-five Newcomen pumping engines were installed at mines in Britain, France, Holland, Sweden and Russia. In the next fifty years only a few small changes were made to the engine design. It was a great advancement.

While Newcomen engines brought practical benefits, they were inefficient in terms of the use of energy to power them. The system of alternately sending jets of steam, then cold water into the cylinder meant that the walls of the cylinder were alternately heated, then cooled with each stroke. Each charge of steam introduced would continue condensing until the cylinder approached working temperature once again. So at each stroke part of the potential of the steam was lost.

==Separate condenser==
[[File:Watt steam pumping engine.JPG|thumb|left|300px|The major components of a Watt pumping engine]]
In 1763, [[James Watt]] was working as instrument maker at the [[University of Glasgow]] when he was assigned the job of repairing a model Newcomen engine and noted how inefficient it was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Model Newcomen Engine, repaired by James Watt|url=http://www.huntsearch.gla.ac.uk/cgi-bin/foxweb/huntsearch/DetailedResults.fwx?collection=all&amp;SearchTerm=C.29&amp;mdaCode=GLAHM|website=University of Glasgow Hunterian Museum &amp; Art Gallery|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1765, Watt conceived the idea of equipping the engine with a separate [[condensation]] chamber, which he called a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|"condenser"]]. Because the condenser and the working [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] were separate, condensation occurred without significant loss of heat from the cylinder. The condenser remained cold and below [[atmospheric pressure]] at all times, while the cylinder remained hot at all times.

Steam was drawn from the boiler to the cylinder under the [[piston]]. When the piston reached the top of the cylinder, the steam inlet valve closed and the valve controlling the passage to the condenser opened. The condenser being at a lower pressure, drew the steam from the cylinder into the condenser where it cooled and condensed from water vapor to liquid water, maintaining a partial vacuum in the condenser that was communicated to the space of the cylinder by the connecting passage. External atmospheric pressure then pushed the piston down the cylinder.

The separation of the cylinder and condenser eliminated the loss of heat that occurred when steam was condensed in the working cylinder of a Newcomen engine. This gave the Watt engine greater efficiency than the Newcomen engine, reducing the amount of coal consumed while doing the same amount of work as a Newcomen engine.

In Watt's design, the cold water was injected only into the condensation chamber. This type of condenser is known as a ''jet condenser''. The condenser is located in a cold water bath below the cylinder. The volume of water entering the condenser as spray absorbed the latent heat of the steam, and was determined as seven times the volume of  the condensed steam. The condensate and the injected water was then removed by the air pump, and the surrounding cold water served to absorb the remaining thermal energy to retain a condenser temperature of 30°C to 45°C and the equivalent pressure of 0.04 to 0.1 bar &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/treatiseonsteame01fareuoft|title=A treatise on the steam engine : historical, practical, and descriptive|last=Farey|first=John|date=1827-01-01|publisher=London : Printed for Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=339 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each stroke the warm condensate was drawn off from the condenser and sent to a hot well by a vacuum pump, which also helped to evacuate the steam from under the power cylinder. The still-warm condensate was recycled as feedwater for the boiler.

Watt's next improvement to the Newcomen design was to seal the top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a jacket. Steam was passed through the jacket before being admitted below the piston, keeping the piston and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it. The second improvement was the utilisation of steam expansion against the vacuum on the other side of the piston. The steam supply was cut during the stroke, and the steam expanded against the vacuum on the other side. This increased the efficiency of the engine, but also created a variable torque on the shaft which was undesirable for many applications, in particular pumping. Watt therefore limited the expansion to a ratio of 1:2 (i.e. the steam supply was cut at half stroke). This increased the theoretical efficiency from 6.4% to 10.6%, with only a small variation in piston pressure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Watt did not use high pressure steam because of safety concerns.&lt;ref name="Dickinson" /&gt;{{rp|85}}

These improvements led to the fully developed version of 1776 that actually went into production.&lt;ref&gt;Hulse David K (1999): "The early development of the steam engine"; TEE Publishing, Leamington Spa, U.K., ISBN, 85761 107 1 p. 127 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Partnership of Matthew Boulton and James Watt==
{{main article|Boulton and Watt}}
The separate condenser showed dramatic potential for improvements on the Newcomen engine but Watt was still discouraged by seemingly insurmountable problems before a marketable engine could be perfected. It was only after entering into partnership with [[Matthew Boulton]] that such became reality. Watt told Boulton about his ideas on improving the engine, and Boulton, an avid entrepreneur, agreed to fund development of a test engine at [[Soho, Birmingham|Soho]], near [[Birmingham]]. At last Watt had access to facilities and the practical experience of craftsmen who were soon able to get the first engine working. As fully developed, it used about 75% less fuel than a similar Newcomen one.

In 1775, Watt designed two large engines: one for the [[Bloomfield Colliery]] at [[Tipton]], completed in March 1776, and one for [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]]'s ironworks at [[Willey, Shropshire]], which was at work the following month. A third engine, at [[Stratford, London|Stratford-le-Bow]] in east London, was also working that summer.&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Hills, ''James Watt: II The Years of Toil, 1775–1785'' (Landmark, Ashbourne, 2005), 58–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watt had tried unsuccessfully for several years to obtain an accurately bored cylinder for his steam engines, and was forced to use hammered iron, which was out of round and caused leakage past the piston. Joseph Wickham Roe stated in 1916: "When [John] [[John Smeaton|Smeaton]] saw the first engine he reported to the Society of Engineers that 'Neither the tools nor the workmen existed who could manufacture such a complex machine with sufficient precision{{Single double}}.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}. Reprinted by McGraw-Hill, New York and London, 1926 ({{LCCN|27024075}}); and by Lindsay Publications, Inc., Bradley, Illinois, ({{ISBN|978-0-917914-73-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1774, [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented a boring machine in which the shaft that held the cutting tool was supported on both ends and extended through the cylinder, unlike the cantilevered borers then in use. Boulton wrote in 1776 that "Mr. Wilkinson has bored us several cylinders almost without error; that of 50 inches diameter, which we have put up at Tipton, does not err on the thickness of an old shilling in any part".&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

[[Boulton and Watt]]'s practice was to help mine-owners and other customers to build engines, supplying men to erect them and some specialised parts. However, their main profit from their patent was derived from charging a licence fee to the engine owners, based on the cost of the fuel they saved. The greater fuel efficiency of their engines meant that they were most attractive in areas where fuel was expensive, particularly [[Cornwall]], for which three engines were ordered in 1777, for the [[Wheal Busy]], [[Ting Tang]], and [[Chacewater]] mines.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, 96–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later improvements==
[[File:WattParallelMotion.jpg|right|thumb|Watt's [[parallel motion]] on a pumping engine]]
The first Watt engines were atmospheric pressure engines, like the Newcomen engine but with the condensation taking place separate from the cylinder. Driving the engines using both low pressure steam and a partial vacuum raised the possibility of [[reciprocating engine]] development.&lt;ref&gt;Hulse David K (2001): "The development of rotary motion by the steam power"; TEE Publishing, Leamington Spa, U.K., {{ISBN|1 85761 119 5}} : p 58 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; An arrangement of valves could alternately admit low pressure steam to the cylinder and then connect with the condenser. Consequently, the direction of the power stroke might be reversed, making it easier to obtain rotary motion. Additional benefits of the [[Single- and Double-acting cylinder|double acting]] engine were increased efficiency, higher speed (greater power) and more regular motion.

Before the development of the double acting piston, the linkage to the beam and the piston rod had been by means of a chain, which meant that power could only be applied in one direction, by pulling. This was effective in engines that were used for pumping water, but the double action of the piston meant that it could push as well as pull. This was not possible as long as the beam and the rod were connected by a chain. Furthermore, it was not possible to connect the piston rod of the sealed cylinder ''directly'' to the beam, because while the rod moved vertically in a straight line, the beam was pivoted at its centre, with each side inscribing an arc. To bridge the conflicting actions of the beam and the piston, Watt developed his [[parallel motion]]. This masterpiece of engineering uses a four bar [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkage]] coupled with a [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] to produce the required straight line motion much more cheaply than if he had used a slider type of linkage.  He was very proud of his solution.

Having the beam connected to the piston shaft by a means that applied force alternately in both directions also meant that it was possible to use the motion of the beam to turn a wheel. The simplest solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a [[crankshaft|crank]], but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank, Watt was obliged to come up with another solution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/james-watt-monopolist James Watt: Monopolist]&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted the [[epicyclic gear|epicyclic]] [[sun and planet gear]] system suggested by an employee [[William Murdoch]], only later reverting, once the patent rights had expired, to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2012|pp=176–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy, serving as a [[flywheel]] which, once set in motion, by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes. To its rotating central shaft, belts and gears could be attached to drive a great variety of machinery.

Because factory machinery needed to operate at a constant speed, Watt linked a steam regulator valve to a [[centrifugal governor]] which he adapted from those used to automatically control the speed of windmills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A History of the Growth of the Steam-Engine|last=Thurston|first= Robert H.|year=1875 |publisher =D.

These improvements allowed the steam engine to replace the [[water wheel]] and horses as the main sources of power for British industry, thereby freeing it from geographical constraints and becoming one of the main drivers in the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Watt was also concerned with fundamental research on the functioning of the steam engine. His most notable measuring device, still in use today, is the Watt [[indicator diagram|indicator]] incorporating a [[manometer]] to measure steam pressure within the cylinder according to the position of the piston, enabling a diagram to be produced representing the pressure of the steam as a function of its volume throughout the cycle.

==Preserved Watt engines==
The oldest surviving Watt engine is [[Old Bess (beam engine)|''Old Bess'']] of 1777, now in the [[Science Museum, London]]. 
The oldest working engine in the world is the [[Smethwick Engine]], brought into service in May 1779 and now at [[Thinktank, Birmingham|Thinktank]] in Birmingham (formerly at the now defunct [[Museum of Science and Industry, Birmingham]]).
The oldest still in its original engine house and still capable of doing the job for which it was installed is the 1812 Boulton and Watt engine at the [[Crofton Pumping Station]]. This was used to pump water for the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]]; on certain weekends throughout the year the modern pumps are switched off and the two steam engines at Crofton still perform this function.
The oldest extant rotative steam engine, the [[Whitbread Engine]] (from 1785, the third rotative engine ever built), is located in the [[Powerhouse Museum]] in Sydney, Australia.
A Boulton-Watt engine of 1788 may be found in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum, London]].,&lt;ref name="Science Museum, lap engine, 1788" &gt;{{cite web

[[The Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]] houses a replica of a 1788 Watt rotative engine. It is a full-scale working model of a Boulton-Watt engine.  The American industrialist [[Henry Ford]] commissioned the replica engine from the English manufacturer Charles Summerfield in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Ford Museum|website=|url= https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/275719/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum also holds an original Boulton and Watt atmospheric pump engine, originally used for canal pumping in Birmingham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Ford Museum|website=|url= https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/3174/}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrated below, and in use in situ at the Bowyer Street pumping station&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rowington Records|website=|url= http://rowingtonrecords.com/Tiger/Canals/Warwick%20and%20Birmingham%20Canal/index.html#img=DSC00273.JPG}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1796 until 1854, and afterwards removed to Dearborn in 1929.

== Watt engine produced by Hathorn, Davey and Co ==
In the 1880s, Hathorn Davey and Co / Leeds produced a 1 hp / 125 rpm atmospheric engine with external condenser but without steam expansion. It has been argued that this was probably the last commercial atmospheric engine to be manufactured. As an atmospheric engine, it did not have a pressurized boiler. It was intended for small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://the-condensing-engine-project.com/history/daveys-engine-of-1885/|title=Davey's engine of 1885|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==
Watt's Expansion Engine is generally considered as of historic interest only. There are however some recent developments which may lead to a renaissance of the technology. Today, there is an enormous amount of waste steam and [[waste heat]] with temperatures between 100 and 150&amp;nbsp;°C generated by industry. In addition, solarthermal collectors, geothermal energy sources and biomass reactors produce heat in this temperature range. There are technologies to utilise this energy, in particular the [[Organic Rankine cycle|Organic Rankine Cycle]]. In principle, these are steam turbines which do not use water but a fluid (a refrigerant) which evaporates at temperatures below 100°C. Such systems are however fairly complex. They work with pressures of 6 to 20 bars, so that the whole system has to be completely sealed.

The Expansion Engine can offer significant advantages here, in particular for lower power ratings of 2 to 100&amp;nbsp;kW: with expansion ratios of 1:5, the theoretical efficiency reaches 15%, which is in the range of ORC systems. The Expansion Engine uses water as working fluid which is simple, cheap, not toxic, nonflammable and not corrosive. It works at pressure near and below atmospheric, so that sealing is not a problem. And it is a simple machine, implying cost effectiveness. Researchers from the University of Southampton / UK are currently developing a modern version of Watt's engine in order to generate energy from waste steam and waste heat. They improved the theory, demonstrating that theoretical efficiencies of up to 17.4% (and actual efficiencies of 11%) are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Müller|first=Gerald|year=2015|title=Experimental investigation of the atmospheric steam engine with forced expansion|url=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/381695/1/Revised%2520manuscript%2520Muller%252022_06_2014.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2018|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=75|pages=348–355|via=|doi=10.1016/j.renene.2014.09.061}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:25 Watt Condensing Engine Model 2016.jpg|left|thumb|The 25 Watt Experimental Condensing Engine built and tested at Southampton University]]

In order to demonstrate the principle, a 25 watt experimental model engine was built and tested. The engine incorporates steam expansion as well as new features such as electronic control. The picture shows the model built and tested in 2016.

Currently, a [https://the-condensing-engine-project.com/ project] to build and test a 2&amp;nbsp;kW engine is under preparation. An example of how it was built with its material.

== Biography ==
He was a great-grandson of Wadih, the freedman of the [[caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]]. Until 873 he lived in [[Armenia]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], working under the patronage of the [[Iran]]ian dynasty of the [[Tahirids]]; then he traveled to [[India]], [[Egypt]] and the [[Maghreb]],&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Ya'qūbī |volume=28 |page=904 |first=Griffithes Wheeler |last=Thatcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; and died in Egypt. He died in [[Anno Hegirae|AH]] 284 (897/8).&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

His [[Shia]] sympathies&lt;ref&gt;Camilla Adang, ''Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible: From Ibn Rabban to Ibn Hazm'', (E.J. Brill, 1996), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; are found throughout his works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/652001/al-Yaqubi Ya'qubi]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 872, he lists the kingdoms of [[Bilad el-Sudan]], including [[Ghana]], [[Gao]], and [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levtzion|first1=Nehemia|title=Ancient Ghana and Mali|date=1973|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co Ltd|location=New York|isbn=0841904316|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
