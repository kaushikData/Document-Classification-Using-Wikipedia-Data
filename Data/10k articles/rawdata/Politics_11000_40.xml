The '''2002 Somali Reconciliation Conference''', sometimes called the '''Eldoret conference''' were a series of meetings held in [[Eldoret]], [[Kenya]] during November 2002. It was attended by most supporters of the [[Transitional National Government]] (TNG) of [[Somalia]]. The TNG was the predecessor organization of the [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG).

However, at the time, the [[Rahanweyn Resistance Army]] (RRA) was still hotly contending with other factions, including warlord [[Adan Madobe-Habsade]], who captured [[Baidoa]]. The RRA accused the [[Juba Valley Alliance]] of assisting the warlord, an accusation denied by the JVA leader [[Barre Adan Shire Hiiraale]].&lt;ref name=SOMALIA-INTERVIEW-WITH-BARRE-ADAN-SHIRE&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=30536&amp;SelectRegion=Horn_of_Africa&amp;SelectCountry=SOMALIA SOMALIA: Interview with Barre Adan Shire, chairman of the Juba Valley Alliance (JVA)] IRIN&lt;/ref&gt;

Former President and [[member of parliament]] [[Ali Mahdi Muhammad]] blamed [[Ethiopia]] for interfering in the meetings. He left the conference to return to [[Mogadishu]], saying it was a waste of time.&lt;ref name=SOMALI-WARLORD-QUITS-PEACE-TALKS&gt;{{cite news

'''Aerial reconnaissance''' using heavier-than-air machines was an entirely new science that had to be improvised step-by-step. Early operations were low-level flights with the pilot often dismounting from the plane to report verbally to the nearest officers. Photographic support was urgently developed, initially requiring a full-time photographer on-board to handle the heavy, awkward equipment. The interpreting of aerial images was an important new speciality, essential for accurate mapping. By 1915, air-to-ground radio was in use for reconnaissance pilots.

The leader in aeronautics at the outset was France, with its Blériot observation planes, while Germany was more advanced in optics. The British were somewhat behind in the early stages, owing to lack of government backing. America would make valuable contributions in the form of multi-lens cameras for precision spotting.

Reconnaissance remained an under-rated military art, compared with aerial combat, which gained the publicity, but impacted less on the outcome of the war. 

==Beginnings==
The first use of an airplane in war was a reconnaissance flight performed on 23 October 1911 by Captain [[Carlo Maria Piazza]] in a [[Blériot XI]] during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in [[Tripolitania]]. Military aerial photography began that December. The experience in World War I would begin on very similar terms, with French Bleriot and German [[Etrich Taube|Taube]] monoplanes. Reconnaissance was widely perceived as the only practical use of airplanes. 
[[File:Aerial observer in balloon gondola, 1918.jpg|thumb|right|A French balloon observer, 1918]]

While most of the combatant countries possessed a few military aircraft in August 1914, these were almost exclusively devoted to reconnaissance and  [[artillery]] spotting, supplementing well-tried and familiar platforms like balloons and [[kite]]s. Tethered [[balloon]]s could ascend to as high as a mile, but were easy to shoot down. Furthermore, they were unstable observation platforms in any wind, leading to attempts to stabilize them with kite-tails or [[drogue]]s attached to the basket. [[Dirigible]]s like the huge new German [[Zeppelin]]s were considered the best reconnaissance platforms and they served effectively for maritime patrols. Vertical camera installations were used from the beginning of the war, but they were too heavy and bulky for light airplanes, and most early reconnaissance from airplanes consisted of visual observation and written reports. Handheld cameras were widely used but with disappointing results. Good photographs required both  skilled flying and an operator who could devote time to handle the camera and the unwieldy and heavy glass plates it required. In time, longer focal length lenses were used, cameras and gear grew lighter and bigger, and for survival, operating altitudes increased up to the 12-18,000 foot level. Driven high, aircrews began to use oxygen and heated clothing items.

The critical discipline of communicating results led to rampant improvisation. At first it was not uncommon for aircraft to land next to command posts so the pilot could personally pass on urgent information. For artillery spotting, time was of the essence, and the French tried air-dropped messaging, colored flares, and pre-arranged aircraft maneuvers to convey information. France was reportedly the first to try airborne radios, often transmitters alone due to the weight penalty; others maintain that Britain preceded with the light-weight Sterling radio set in aircraft by 1915.
[[File:RFC aircraft with aerial reconnaissance camera.jpg|thumbnail|left|An aerial reconnaissance camera of 1916 as operated by the pilot of a [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c|B.E.2c]]]]
Germany had a scientific lead and adopted the first aerial camera, a [[Goerz (company)|Görz]], in 1913. Austria-Hungary followed their lead. Just two weeks into the war, reporters noted of airplanes: “They have ranged constantly over the enemy’s positions, so that the French have always known what the Germans have been doing. This has so disconcerted the latter that they are now making efforts to frighten the French air scouts away.” By 17 August 1914 and repeatedly thereafter, Belgian “air scouts” reported on German troop movements.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, 15 August, 17 August, 22 August, 4 November 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

France was by far the aeronautical leader at the time, and the French Army had incorporated cameras in airplanes from the beginning. France began the war with several squadrons of Blériot observation planes. The French Army developed procedures for getting prints into the hands of field commanders quickly. In Britain, then lagging far behind in aviation, the reconnaissance pioneer [[Frederick Charles Victor Laws|F.C.V. Laws]] established the first heavier-than-air photography unit at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]] in 1913, using a [[Farman]] fitted with a Watson camera. In stark contrast with the French, early British reconnaissance was essentially conducted on an amateur basis, lacking in official backing.

The United States played an important role in the last months of the war, using French aircraft and modified cameras. Some techniques and equipment used in civilian surveying and mapping were developed by the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] when the topographic engineer, [[James W. Bagley]], transferred from the [[US Geological Survey]] to the army.&lt;ref&gt;Bagley, James Warren. 1917. [https://archive.org/details/usepanoramiccam00baglgoog ''The use of the panoramic camera in topographic surveying: with notes on the application of photogrammetry to aerial surveys'']. US Geological Survey Bulletin #657. Washington: Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; Major Bagley brought his recently invented [[tri-lens camera]] to France, where it was used to make one vertical and two oblique images from airplanes. These images were used to overprint enemy trenches and gun emplacements over existing maps for precision targeting. An example of this camera is held at the Smithsonian Institution: "This object is on display in the Boeing Aviation Hangar at the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] in [[Chantilly, VA]]. [[Fairchild Aerial Camera Corporation]] built the production model of the T-2 and T-2A four-lens camera, which improved upon the T-1 tri-lens mapping camera developed by Maj. James Bagley of the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]]. The T-2A had one vertical lens and three oblique lenses set at 35 degrees, which provided a 120-degree field of view at right angles to the direction of flight. Four lens caps are also displayed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19711004000 Camera, Aerial, Mapping, Fairchild T-2A]. National Air and Space Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy and Russia had prominent roles as well, with Italy deploying some of the best performing aircraft. The small Ottoman air forces were mostly an extension of German air power. The failure of the [[Schlieffen Plan]] offensive in 1914 is attributed in part to French air superiority blinding German reconnaissance, but the German victory at [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] is thought to have been helped by prompt response to air intelligence about Russian movements.

Despite the improvised start, all sides quickly learned the importance of aerial photography, and by 1916 heavier-than-air reconnaissance was a regular practice along the front. This in turn necessitated fighter escorts, and thus drove much of the rapid aeronautical progress of the four years of war. Support of ground forces was almost the sole role of reconnaissance; strategic air war concepts were as yet embryonic. At sea, lighter-than-air photography still dominated; but Zeppelins turned out to be very vulnerable over settled areas. [[Flying boat]]s and [[seaplane]]s ("Hydro-aeroplanes")came into their own for coastal patrol duties. By the end of the war both sides maintained detailed maps of the front derived from mosaics of aerial photographs. Germany alone reportedly generated 4,000 images a day in 1918.

==Equipment==
All major combatants maintained traditional units of kite-balloons and airships for point surveillance and reconnaissance. These were vulnerable and tethered balloon observers were the first to use parachutes. Lighter-than-air platforms would soon be eclipsed, though not replaced, by fixed-wing aircraft.

At the beginning, France had a significant corps of Blériot type observation aircraft, soon replaced by a profusion of more capable types. The [[Royal Flying Corps]] entered the war with the slow but stable and reliable [[B.E.2]] reconnaissance aircraft. It served acceptably in the role until new German fighters drove it from the skies in 1915-16. B.E.2 variants typically mounted a vertical camera outside the pilot’s (rear) cockpit. The more capable but similar [[R.E.8]] replaced the B.E.2c as the standard RAF reconnaissance aircraft and remained in that role despite requiring escort for survival. British aircraft used the Watson Air Camera, the Type A camera, and later the C, E, L and finally L/B cameras (L for Laws and B for [[John Moore-Brabazon|Brabazon]]) developed specifically for aircraft. The early C-type used the available 12 inch lenses and a 4×5&amp;nbsp;in (10x12.5&amp;nbsp;cm)plate. The Allies began to standardize on 18×24&amp;nbsp;cm plates and 25, 50 and 120&amp;nbsp;cm focal lengths, 50 being the most common.

The Central Powers used many different aircraft but especially [[Rumpler]] and [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|Albatros]] types mounting Görz and [[Zeiss Ikon|ICA]] cameras. The Germans used also a standard 70&amp;nbsp;cm focal length and 13×18&amp;nbsp;cm plates. The radio-equipped unarmed photoship [[Rumpler C.VII]] (Rubild) — for ''Rumpler-Bildflugzeug'' (picture-aircraft)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gray |first1=Peter |last2=Thetford |first2=Owen |date=1962 |title=German Aircraft of the First World War |url= |location=London. UK |publisher=Putnam |page=202 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; — distinguished itself for long-range and high-altitude, reaching 21,000 feet. Unusual recon aircraft included the armored [[Junkers J.I]] for low-level flights, the gigantic long-range [[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets|Ilya Muromets]] from Russia, and the high-performing (at well over 200&amp;nbsp;km/h top speed) Italian [[Ansaldo SVA]], considered nearly uninterceptable. Italy standardized on the simple 24-plate Lamperti camera.
[[File:German aerial cameras, 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Captured German aerial cameras, France 1918. Ives/1920]]

German [[optics]] was overwhelmingly superior, as exemplified by [[Carl Zeiss]] lenses and optical glass. The Allies had to quickly learn to make lenses especially for long foci. In the meantime they had to make do with such short-focus lenses as could be found. When the U.S. entered the war, the Army urgently requested that American civilians turn in their lenses and optics, including telescopes and binoculars, for aerial use, specifically naming several sought-after German manufactures. Cameras quickly became large and mechanically very complex. German and Italian cameras generally used 13×18&amp;nbsp;cm plates. France standardized on the advanced deMaria cameras of various configurations. For the last two years of the war, Britain used almost exclusively the 35-pound, semi-automatic, prop-driven L camera.

As was the case for airplanes, the U.S. made use of French and British cameras. As an example, the semi-automatic American deRam (from the French) weighed 45&amp;nbsp;kg, had a focal length of 50&amp;nbsp;cm (standard), and took 18×24&amp;nbsp;cm plates. The U.S. flew [[Curtiss Jenny]]s with [[Folmer &amp; Schwing|Folmer-Schwing]] (Graflex) handheld cameras during the Mexican excursion in 1916. These became the K-1, first in a long line of U.S. aerial cameras. The attempts at Allied interoperability was thus described at the time: “The task of harmonizing the photographic practice as taught in America, following English lines, with French practice as followed in the theater of war, and of adapting planes built on English designs so that they could carry French apparatus, was a formidable one, not likely to be soon forgotten by any who had a part in it.”&lt;ref&gt;Airplane Photography, see below.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overlapping [[stereoscopic]] photos began to be taken, requiring carefully timed exposures. Fully automatic cameras and [[film]] cameras came into use. Germany began using electrically heated cameras and devised engine-driven generator power. Wind-driven generators, both [[Venturi tube#Venturi tubes|venturis]] and small props, came into use for automation. Suction was used to keep film flat on the plate. Despite the weight penalty, [[radiotelegraphy]] gradually replaced earlier “message-in-a-bottle” airdrops. Simple codes for artillery spotting were worked out. Despite some experiments, night photography was unsuccessful due to insufficient flash power and film speed, and inability to precisely time the exposure to the illumination.

At the end of the war, aerial photography was an enormous ongoing project. The number of exposed images numbered in the millions, with many more prints. Large photo-mosaics covering the entire [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] at scales as low as 1:8000 were created and continuously updated. It is estimated that about one third of sorties were devoted to reconnaissance.
[[File:Call for lenses and optics for use in aeroplanes, U.S. Army, 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Urgent request for civilian optical gear: note nearly all lenses sought are of German manufacture. U.S.Army/Nat. Geogr./Jan. 1918]]

==Results==
From an essentially zero base, armies had to create and train interpretation units, since the aerial view and stereoscopic view was quite alien to what ground-based reconnaissance would see. Interpreters had to have extensive knowledge of military hardware. They had to learn how to use shadows for size estimation, and to detect the increasing use of camouflage and decoys. Equally importantly, interpreters learned to standardize annotations and present comprehensive marked-up imagery to commanders. The static fronts and fixed fortifications in Europe were especially suitable for turning the art of interpretation into a science, while the far-ranging operations in the desert and at sea put a great premium on serendipitous discovery and resourcefulness.

Maritime reconnaissance tended to generate its own separate technology and procedures, aided by the customary sharp separation of the fleet from the armies. In the air, however, the two services overlapped, which began to cause friction in assigning responsibilities, especially for sea powers like the U.K. and the U.S. The use of ship-based observation aircraft (though not true carriers) was already well advanced by the end of the war. This quickly became a force multiplier for the fleet. It complicated offensive sea power; for example, Zeppelin surveillance of the North Sea made it difficult for the Royal Navy to exploit its naval superiority.

In four years, commanders learned that reconnaissance innately favors the defensive, as it reduces surprises and makes it difficult for the opponent to mass forces for attack. Inability to conduct reconnaissance, such as due to weather or enemy air domination, conversely leaves one highly vulnerable, as occurred repeatedly during the War. Commanders learned that in aircraft, there is no substitute for performance, and in cameras, no substitute for focal length. They learned to regularly monitor the opponent in order to detect any changes; and they learned the absolute necessity of maintaining libraries and institutional knowledge of targets and of the visual “signatures” of not only equipment, but the subtle effects thereof – tracks, marks, etc. – on the environment. Experts agree that most of this had to be relearned the hard way two decades later.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard&lt;/ref&gt;

Perennial problems included the shortage of trained and experienced photo-interpreters, the difficulty in distributing timely and interpreted prints to exactly the commanders needing them, a lack of overall coordination of effort and centralized interpretation (a ''common air picture''), and the tendency of field commanders to demand risky, repeated flights for objectives only for the photos to languish in files somewhere along the process.

Finally, the recurrent pattern of reconnaissance not gaining recognition commensurate with its importance developed during these years. There were no “reconnaissance aces” and recon pilots were not household names. Air combat gained immense publicity, but – apart from reconnaissance – air operations had negligible military effect. This imbalance in perception would have consequences for preparedness in later years.

[[File:D5401 AWS 260108 d.adkins.jpg|150px|thumb|The AWS indicator inside [[British Rail Class 27|Class 27]] showing ''caution''.]]

The '''Automatic Warning System''' ('''AWS''') was introduced in 1956 in the United Kingdom to provide a train driver with an audible warning and visual reminder that they were approaching a [[UK railway signalling#Running signals|distant signal]] at caution.&lt;ref name="Awsrules"&gt;{{cite web| title = AWS &amp; TPWS Handbook: Section 1.1.3 "The purpose of AWS"| url=https://www.rssb.co.uk/rgs/rulebooks/RS522%20Iss%203.pdf| publisher= RSSB| format =pdf| accessdate =2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its operation was later extended to give warnings for;&lt;ref name="Awsrules 1.4"&gt;{{cite web| title = AWS &amp; TPWS Handbook: Section 1.4 "AWS indications and their meanings"| url=https://www.rssb.co.uk/rgs/rulebooks/RS522%20Iss%203.pdf| publisher= RSSB| format =pdf| accessdate =2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AWS was based on a 1930 system developed by Alfred Ernest Hudd (ca. 1883-1958)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Alfred_Ernest_Hudd|title=Alfred Ernest Hudd - Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marketed as the "Strowger-Hudd" system. An earlier contact system, installed on the [[Great Western Railway]] since 1906 and known as [[Automatic train control#United Kingdom|automatic train control]] (ATC), was gradually supplanted by AWS within the [[Western Region of British Railways]].

== Principles of operation ==
[[File:Class 43 driver's AWS equipment.jpg|thumb|Driver's AWS equipment in a [[British Rail Class 43 (HST)|Class 43]] driving cab]]

Information is conveyed by [[electromagnetic induction]] to the moving train through equipment fixed in the middle of the track, known as an ''AWS magnet''.&lt;ref name="Awsrules"/&gt;  The system works by the train detecting sequences and polarities of magnetic fields passing between the track equipment and the train equipment via a receiver under the train.&lt;ref name="Awsrules"/&gt; Multiple unit trains have a receiver at each end. Vehicles that can operate singly (single car DMUs and locomotives) only have one. This could be either at the front or rear depending on the direction the vehicle is travelling in.

The equipment on a train consists of;
* A magnetically operated 'receiver' underneath the front of the train
* A relay control box
* A visual indicator (known colloquially as a 'sunflower') 
* An audible sounder which produces either a 'horn' or 'bell' sound

===AWS at signals===
[[File:TPWS_panel.jpg|thumb|An AWS/TPWS Driver machine interface]]
As the train passes over an AWS magnet, the 'sunflower' indicator in the driver's cab will change to ''all black''. If the signal being approached is displaying a 'clear' for a semaphore or green for a multiple aspect colour light signal, the AWS will sound a bell (modern locomotives/multiple units use an electronic sounder that gives a distinctive 'ping') and leave the visual indicator black. This lets the driver know that the next signal is showing 'clear' and that the AWS system is working.

If the signal being approached is displaying a restrictive aspect (red, yellow or double yellow in colour-light installations or a distant semaphore at caution (horizontal)), the AWS will sound a horn. The driver then has approximately 2 seconds to cancel the warning by pressing and releasing the AWS/TPWS acknowledgement button (if a driver should collapse onto the button or keep it held down, the AWS will not be cancelled).&lt;ref name="Awsrules"/&gt; On cancelling the warning, the horn then stops and the visual indicator changes to a pattern of black and yellow spokes, which persists until the next AWS magnet and reminds the driver that they have cancelled the AWS.

As a [[fail-safe]] mechanism, if the driver fails to cancel the warning in time, the emergency brake will apply and bring the train to a stand. When this occurs the red ''Brake demand'' light will flash&lt;ref name="rssbatir"/&gt; on the AWS/TPWS Driver machine interface. The driver must now push the AWS/TPWS acknowledgement button, and the brakes will release after a safety time out period has elapsed.

AWS is provided at most main aspect signals on running lines, though there are some exceptions:&lt;ref name="Awsrules"/&gt;
* At through stations where the permitted speed is 30&amp;nbsp;mph or less and the layout is complex. Where this occurs, these are called ''AWS gap'' areas.
* AWS magnets are not provided at semaphore stop signals.
* Where a line is not fitted with AWS magnets, it is shown in the [[Sectional Appendix]].
[[File:temp speed reduction warning.jpg|thumb|75px|Temporary speed restriction warning board]]

===AWS for speed warnings===
The system works in the same way as for signals, except that a fixed magnet positioned between the running rails is located at the service braking distance before the speed reduction. The single magnet will always cause a horn (caution) to sound in the cab, which the driver must cancel to prevent the emergency brake applying. Beyond the magnet, a lineside warning board will advise the driver of the speed requirement ahead.

== History ==

=== Early devices ===
[[File:Zugsicherung sbahn berlin.jpg|thumb|Berlin S-Bahn [[train stop]] in its engaged (left) and disengaged (right) position]]

Early devices used a mechanical connection between the signal and the locomotive. In 1840, the locomotive engineer [[Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy|Edward Bury]] experimented with a system whereby a lever at track level, connected to the signal, sounded the locomotive's whistle and turned a cab-mounted red lamp. Ten years later, the redoubtable Colonel [[William Yolland]] of the [[Railway Inspectorate]] was calling for a system that not only alerted the driver but also automatically applied the brakes when signals were passed at danger but no satisfactory method of bringing this about was found.

In 1873, United Kingdom Patent No. 3286 was granted to C. Davidson and C.D. Williams for a system in which, if a signal was passed at danger, a trackside lever operated the locomotive's whistle, applied the brake, shut off steam and alerted the guard. Numerous similar patents followed but they all bore the same disadvantage – that they could not be used at higher speeds for risk of damage to the mechanism – and they came to nothing. In Germany, the Kofler system used arms projecting from signal posts to connect with a pair of levers, one representing ''caution'' and the other ''stop'', mounted on the locomotive cab roof. To address the problem of operation at speed, the sprung mounting for the levers was connected directly to the locomotive's [[Journal bearing|axle box]] to ensure correct alignment. When Berlin's [[S-Bahn]] was electrified in 1929, a development of this system, with the contact levers moved from the roofs to the sides of the trains, was installed at the same time.

The first useful device was invented by [[Vincent Raven]] of the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] in 1895, patent number 23384. Although this provided audible warning only, it did indicate to the driver when points ahead were set for a diverging route. By 1909, the company had installed it on about 100 miles of track. In 1907 [[Frank Wyatt Prentice]] patented a radio signalling system, using a continuous cable laid between the rails to relay "[[Heinrich Hertz#Electromagnetic research|Hertzian Waves]]" to the locomotive.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 843550, 5 February 1907&lt;/ref&gt; The signal was turned off if the [[Signalling block system|block]] were not "clear", a white or green light in the cab then turned to red and the brakes were applied.  The [[LSWR]] installed the system on its [[Hampton Court Branch]] in 1911, but shortly after removed it when the line was [[LSWR suburban lines#Electrification of the LSWR network|electrified]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Alan A|title=London's Local Railways|date=1978|publisher=David and Charles|location=Newton Abbot, England|isbn=0-7153-7479-6|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GWR automatic train control ===
The first system to be put into wide use was developed in 1905 by the [[Great Western Railway]] and protected by UK patents 12661 and 25955. Its benefits over previous systems were that it could be used at high speed and that it sounded a confirmation in the cab when a signal was passed at clear.

In the final version of the GWR system, the locomotives were fitted with a [[solenoid]]-operated valve into the vacuum train pipe, maintained in the closed position by a battery. At each distant signal, a long ramp was placed between the rails. This ramp consisted of a straight metal blade set edge-on, almost parallel to the direction of travel (the blade was slightly offset from parallel so in its fixed position it would not wear a groove into the locomotives' contact shoes), mounted on a wooden support. As the locomotive passed over the ramp, a sprung contact shoe beneath the locomotive was lifted and the battery current holding closed the brake valve was broken. In the case of a clear signal, current from a battery energising the ramp (but at opposite polarity) passed to the locomotive through the contact and maintained the brake valve in the closed position, with the reversed-polarity current ringing a bell in the cab. When the signal was at 'danger', the ramp battery was disconnected and so could not replace the locomotive's battery current: the brake valve solenoid would then be released and a horn sounded in the cab. The driver was then expected to cancel the warning and apply the brakes under his own control.

Notwithstanding the heavy commitment of maintaining the batteries in the locomotives and [[signal box]]es, the GWR installed the equipment on all its main lines. For many years, [[Western Region of British Railways|Western Region]] (successors to the GWR) locomotives were dual fitted with both GWR ATC and BR AWS system.

=== Strowger–Hudd system ===
By the 1930s, other railway companies, under pressure from the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]], were considering systems of their own. A non-contact method based on [[Magnetic field|magnetic induction]] was preferred, to eliminate the problems caused by snowfall and day-to-day wear of the contacts which had been discovered in existing systems. The Strowger-Hudd system of Alfred Hudd, which used a pair of magnets, one a permanent and one an electro-magnet, was tested by the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]], [[London and North Eastern Railway]] and the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] but these trials came to nothing.

In 1948 Hudd, now working for the LMS, equipped the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway|London, Tilbury and Southend line]], a division of the LMS, with his system. It was successful and [[British Rail]]ways developed the mechanism further by providing a visual indication in the cab of the aspect of the last signal passed. In 1956, the Ministry of Transport evaluated the GWR, LTS and BR systems and selected the one developed by BR as standard for Britain's railways. This was in response to the [[Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash|Harrow and Wealdstone accident]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=G R S|title=Report on the Double Collision which occurred on 8th October, 1952, at Harrow and Wealdstone Station in the London Midland Region British Railways|date=12 June 1953|publisher=[[HMSO]]|location=London|pages=25–29|oclc=24689450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Network Rail ==

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}Network Rail (NR) AWS consists of:
* A permanent magnet set centrally between the rails and usually positioned such that it is encountered before the signal to which it relates. The top of the magnet casing is nominally level with the running surface of the rails.
* An electromagnet between the rails (with opposite polarity to the permanent magnet) positioned after the permanent magnet. Again the top of the casing is nominally level with the running surface of the rails.
* A cab indicator that can show a black disk or a yellow and black "exploding" disk, known as the "AWS sunflower"
* A control unit that connects the system to the brakes on the train
* A driver's AWS acknowledgement button
* An AWS control panel

The system works on a set/reset principle.
 
When the signal is at 'clear' or green ("off"), the electro-magnet is energised. As the train passes, the permanent magnet sets the system. A short time later, as the train moves forward, the electromagnet resets the system. Once so reset, a bell is sounded (a chime on newer stock) and the indicator is set to all black if it is not already so. No acknowledgement is required from the driver. The system must be reset within one second of being set, otherwise it behaves as for a caution indication.

An additional safeguard is included in the distant-signal control wiring to ensure the AWS "clear" indication is only given when the distant is proved "off" – mechanical semaphore distants have a contact in the electromagnet coil circuit closed only when the arm is raised or lowered by at least 27.5 degrees. Colour-light signals have a current sensing relay in the lamp lighting circuit to prove the signal alight, this is used in combination with the relay controlling the green aspect to energise the AWS electro-magnet. In a Solid State Interlocking the signal module has a "Green-Proved" output from its driver electronics that is used to energise the electromagnet.

[[File:BR AWS inductor 1.JPG|thumb|BR Standard Strength AWS track equipment]]

When the distant signal is at 'caution' or yellow (on), the electro-magnet is de-energised. As the train passes, the permanent magnet sets the system. However, since the electro-magnet is de-energised, the system is not reset. After the one-second delay within which the system can be reset, a horn warning is given until the driver acknowledges by pressing a plunger. If the driver fails to acknowledge the warning within 2.75 seconds, the [[brakes]] are automatically applied. If the driver does acknowledge the warning, the indicator disk changes to yellow and black, to remind the driver that he has acknowledged a warning. The yellow and black indication persists until the next signal and serves as a reminder between signals that the driver is proceeding under caution. The one-second delay before the horn sounds allows the system to operate correctly down to speeds as low as 1.75 miles per hour. Below this speed, the caution horn warning will always be given, but it will be automatically cancelled when the electromagnet resets the system if the driver has not already done so. The display will indicate all black once the system resets.

The system is [[fail-safe]] since, in the event of a loss of power, only the electro-magnet is affected and therefore all trains passing will receive a warning. The system suffers one drawback in that on single track lines, the track equipment will set the AWS system on a train travelling in the opposite direction from that for which the track equipment is intended but not reset it as the electromagnet is encountered before the permanent magnet. To overcome this, a suppressor magnet may be installed in place of an ordinary permanent magnet. When energised, its suppressing coil diverts the magnetic flux from the permanent magnet so that no warning is received on the train. The suppressor magnet is fail-safe since loss of power will cause it to act like an ordinary permanent magnet. A cheaper alternative is the installation of a lineside sign that notifies the driver to cancel and ignore the warning. This sign is a blue square board with a white [[Saltire|St Andrew's cross]] on it (or a yellow board with a black cross, if provided in conjunction with a temporary speed restriction).

With mechanical signalling, the AWS system was installed only at distant signals but, with multi-aspect signalling, it is fitted at all main line signals. All signal aspects, except green, cause the horn to sound and the indicator disc to change to yellow on black.

AWS equipment without electromagnets are fitted at locations where a caution signal is invariably required or where a temporary caution is needed (for example, a temporary speed restriction). This is a secondary advantage of the system because temporary AWS equipment need only contain a permanent magnet. No electrical connection or supply is needed. In this case, the caution indication in the cab will persist until the next green signal is encountered.

To verify that the on-train equipment is functioning correctly [[Traction maintenance depot|motive power depot]] exit lines are fitted with a 'Shed Test Inductor' that produces a caution indication for vehicles entering service. Due to the low speed used on such lines the size of the track equipment is reduced from that found on the operational network.

'Standard Strength' magnets are used everywhere except in d.c. third rail electrification areas and are painted yellow. The minimum field strength to operate the on-train equipment is 2 [[Tesla (unit)|mT]] (measured 125mm (5") above the track equipment casing). Typical track equipment produces a field of 5 mT (measured under the same conditions). 'Shed Test Inductors typically produce a field of 2.5 mT (measured under the same conditions). Where d.c. third rail electrification is installed 'Extra Strength' magnets are fitted and are painted green. This is because the current in the third rail produces a magnetic field of its own which would swamp the 'Standard Strength' magnets.

=== Expansion of AWS application ===
* From 1971, an AWS permanent magnet was fitted ahead of the [[UK railway signalling#Permissible speed indicators|warning indicator]] where the permissible speed of a line reduced by more than a third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Master Rulebook: Signals, hand signals, indicators and signs handbook. Section 7.2 "Warning indicators"| url=https://www.rssb.co.uk/rgs/rulebooks/GERM8000-master-module%20Iss%201.pdf| publisher= Network Rail| format =pdf| accessdate =2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a recommendation of the inquiry into the [[Rail accidents at Morpeth#1969 derailment|derailment at Morpeth]] on 7 May 1969.
* From 1977, a portable AWS permanent magnet was fitted ahead of the warning board on the approach to [[UK railway signalling#Speed restrictions|temporary speed restrictions]] (TSRs). This was a recommendation of the inquiry into the [[Nuneaton rail crash|derailment at Nuneaton]] on 6 June 1975, which occurred when the driver missed a TSR warning board due to its lights being extinguished.
* From 1990, AWS permanent magnets were installed immediately ahead of certain 'high risk' stop signals, as a [[Signal passed at danger|SPAD]] mitigation measure. This additional AWS magnet was suppressed when the associated signal showed a 'proceed' aspect. Since the introduction of the [[Train Protection &amp; Warning System|Train protection and warning system]] (TPWS) it is no longer current practice to use AWS for this purpose. [[Signal passed at danger#Collision prevention systems|SPAD indicators]] were also used.

=== Limitations ===
AWS has only two states; clear and caution. It does not provide any information about what the hazard is.

AWS is a warning system which is designed to be cancelled by the driver. It is possible for a driver on a crowded suburban railway to run all day on cautionary aspects. Continually cancelling warnings can lead to a state of conditioning where the driver fails to take appropriate action when necessary. This has led to a number of fatal accidents.

It is possible for AWS to develop a [[wrong-side failure]] whereby the driver is given no indication or a 'clear' indication instead of a 'caution'. Because of this the rulebook states that "AWS does not relieve the driver of the responsibility of observing and obeying lineside signals and indicators."&lt;ref name="Awsrules"/&gt;

Also, there is no automatic brake application when a stop signal is passed. The newer [[Train Protection &amp; Warning System|TPWS]], which is installed at signals where there is a risk of conflicting movements, the approach to reductions of [[UK railway signalling#Speed indicators|permissible speed]] of more than a third and buffer stops, overcomes this problem.

== Bi-directional operation ==
[[File:Bidirectional_AWS.jpg|thumb|Bidirectional AWS, the permanent magnet is in the middle and there is an electromagnet both sides of it]]
Because the permanent magnet is located in the centre of the track, it operates in both directions. The permanent magnet can be suppressed by an electric coil of suitable strength.

Where signals applying to opposing directions of travel on the same line are suitably positioned relative to each other (i.e. facing each other and about 400yds apart), common track equipment may be used, comprising an unsuppressed permanent magnet sandwiched between with both signals' electro-magnets.

== Liberia ==
One of the mining railways in this country had a more advanced AWS system that employed two or three magnets of either polarity and located near the rails to avoid the suppression problem.  The system was therefore able to give more aspects than the BR version.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6875">'''Basic Allowance for Housing''' ('''BAH''') is a [[Military of the United States|United States military]] [[privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] given to many military members. It was previously called '''Basic allowance for quarters''' (BAQ) and is administered by the Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO).

==How it works==

===Eligibility factors===
BAH is given to members so that they can provide housing for themselves and their dependents (usually spouse and children). BAH is given when the member or their dependents do not occupy government quarters or [[barracks]].

BAH is non [[tax]]able money paid on a monthly basis. There are 3 factors for determining the amount of BAH:
#marital status&lt;ref&gt;[http://military.findlaw.com/family-employment-housing/what-are-military-marriage-laws.html What Are Military Marriage Laws?]&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, this allowance used to be called "marriage allowance" in the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1937/dec/15/soldiers-marriage-allowances SOLDIERS' MARRIAGE ALLOWANCES]&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Pay grade]] (this is essentially synonymous with rank), the higher the grade, the higher the BAH.
#Location in the United States - BAH is intended to match the average monthly rent in the area where the member is stationed, thus more expensive regions (they are indexed by zip codes) to live allocate more BAH. Depending on the status of the assignment (such as temporary duty, or an unaccompanied assignment) the BAH may be calculated where the dependents actually reside.
#If the member has dependents or not. There are 2 types or BAH, with dependents and without dependents. The rationale behind this is that a single person doesn't need as much room as a couple or a family.

The following ''do not'' affect the amount of BAH:
*The number of dependents (a member with a spouse and no children and a spouse and one or several children receive the same amount of BAH).
*The actual amount paid for rent.
*The size of the unit (unlike other calculations like [[Housing and Urban Development|HUD]]'s [[Fair market rent|FMR]])

Reservists who are activated, even if they are housed by the military during their mobilization, are still paid BAH on the assumption that a reservist still may have the civilian obligations (like a mortgage) that BAH is designed to offset.

Lastly, veterans who are full-time students taking advantage of the [[Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008|Post 9-11 GI Bill]] are given an allowance pegged to the BAH with dependents rate for an E-5, irrespective of their rank or dependent status.

A service member who is [[marriage|married]] makes substantially more allowance money than a single member.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Reports of soldiers [[Marriage of convenience|marrying for the extra pay]] are not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.com/news/us-soldiers-shop-wives-get-more-pay-benefits-2D80186882 Hidden cameras reveal how US soldiers 'shop' for wives to get more pay, benefits]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Determining allowances===
Robert D. Niehaus, Inc. (RDN), a private firm based in California is contracted to provide the data used to calculate BAH allowances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/faqbah.cfm|title=Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) - Frequently Asked Questions|work=www.defensetravel.dod.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Locations====
Every location in the U.S. has a BAH, including those without a significant military population.  Non-military areas are combined with similar priced rental markets based on U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD)'s Fair Market Rent (FMR) data, and then use same RDN BAH source data available for similar areas. These comparably priced groups are called "County Cost Groups" (CCGs).  There are 39 CCGs in the U.S, consisting of half of all counties (about 1,500) containing less than two percent of the uniformed services' population eligible to receive BAH.

====Methodology====
The following data sources are used to determine BAH:
* Current residential vacancies, identified in local newspapers and real estate rental listings
* Telephone interviews
* Yellow page listings of apartments
* Real estate management companies
* Real estate professionals
* Fort/post/base housing referral offices
* On-site evaluations
* Internet research
* Housing data available from other government agencies

====Timing====
BAH changes every year, based on data gather during the Summer / Spring active rental seasons.  Generally BAH changes 2-5% annually and 5-10% in "hot" markets.

==OHA==
[[Overseas Housing Allowance]], or OHA may be given instead of BAH when a member is stationed outside the United States. Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) which is similar, but has some significant differences. In OHA, each country, and each region in a country have a cap on a per month basis as to what the military will pay for housing. OHA is the exact amount of monthly rent in the local currency (so the exchange rate is taken into consideration each month as the member is paid in US dollars) up to the cap.

OHA may also be paid in certain circumstances if the dependents are living overseas, for example if a member is deployed, and the dependents stay in a country outside of the US.

Frequently a "utility allowance" also accompanies OHA. This is usually a flat rate given to the member to cover the cost of utilities, regardless of the actual amount.

==Acronyms==
* Basic Housing Allowance (BAH) - The housing subsidy paid to military members
* Military Housing Areas (MHAs) - Zip codes combine to make rental markets surrounding a duty area of metropolitan region.  There are 350 MHAs in the U.S. named for installation of nearest city.
* Military Housing Offices (MHOs) - Local base department involved in BAH
* County Cost Groups" (CCGs) - Comparably priced U.S. rental markets.  There are 39 in the U.S.

When the [[United Kingdom]] declared war on [[Nazi Germany]] at the outset of [[World War II]] it controlled to varying degrees numerous [[Crown colony|crown colonies]], [[Protectorate#British and Commonwealth protectorates|protectorates]] and the [[British Raj|Indian Empire]]. It also maintained unique political ties to four semi-independent [[Dominion|Dominions]]—[[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], and [[New Zealand]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] was also technically a dominion but operated largely as a republic and remained neutral during the war)&lt;/ref&gt;—as part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;The term was popularised during World War I and became official after the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] in 1926. [https://books.google.com/books?id=u2G63IrFXpgC&amp;pg=PA558 W. David McIntyre, 1999, "The Commonwealth"; in Robin Winks (ed.), ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume V: Historiography'', Oxford University Press, p. 558. ]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1939 the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] was a global superpower, with direct or de facto political and economic control of 25% of the world's population, and 30% of its land mass.&lt;ref&gt; Stephen Leacock, ''Our British empire; its structure, its history, its strength'' (1941) 
 pp 266-75. [https://archive.org/details/ourbritishempire00leac online free to borrow]&lt;/ref&gt;

The contribution of the [[British Empire]] and Commonwealth in terms of manpower and [[materiel]] was critical to the Allied war effort. From September 1939 to mid-1942 Britain led [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] efforts in almost every global military theatre. Commonwealth forces ([[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|United Kingdom]], [[Crown colony|Colonial]], [[British Raj|Imperial]] and Dominion), totalling close to [[Military production during World War II#Personnel - Allied - British Empire|15 million]] serving men and women, fought the German, Italian, Japanese and other [[Axis powers|Axis]] armies, air forces and navies across Europe, Africa, Asia, and in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic, Indian, Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Commonwealth forces fought in Britain, and across [[Northwestern Europe]] in the effort to slow or stop the Axis advance. Commonwealth airforces fought the [[Luftwaffe]] to a standstill over Britain, and its armies fought and destroyed Italian forces in North and East Africa and occupied several overseas colonies of German-occupied European nations. Following successful engagements against Axis forces, Commonwealth troops invaded and occupied Libya, Italian Somaliland, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley7 Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commonwealth defeated, held back or slowed the Axis powers for three years while mobilizing their [[Sterling area|globally integrated economy]], military, and industrial infrastructure to build what became, by 1942, the most extensive military apparatus of the war. These efforts came at the cost of 150,000 military deaths, 400,000 wounded, 100,000 prisoners, over 300,000 civilian deaths, and the loss of 70 major warships, 39 submarines, 3,500 aircraft, 1,100 tanks and 65,000 vehicles. During this period the Commonwealth built an enormous military and industrial capacity. Britain became the nucleus of the Allied war effort in Europe, and hosted [[Government in exile#Governments in London|governments in exile in London]] to rally support in [[occupied Europe]] for the Allied effort. Canada delivered almost $4 billion in [[Billion Dollar Gift and Mutual Aid|direct financial aid]] to the United Kingdom, and Australia and New Zealand began shifting to domestic production{{clarify|date=March 2017}} to provide material aid to US forces in the Pacific. Following the US entry into the war in December 1941, the Commonwealth and United States coordinated their military efforts and resources globally. As the scale of the US military involvement and industrial production increased, the US undertook command of many theatres, relieving Commonwealth forces for duty elsewhere, and expanding the scope and intensity of Allied military efforts.&lt;ref name="History of the Second World War"&gt;History of the Second World War (104 volumes), Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London 1949 to 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stacey, C P. (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, David (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it also proved difficult to co-ordinate the defence of far-flung colonies and Commonwealth countries from simultaneous attacks by the Axis Powers. In part this was exacerbated by disagreements over priorities and objectives, as well as the deployment and control of joint forces. The governments of Britain and Australia, in particular, turned to the United States for support. Although the British Empire and the Commonwealth countries all emerged from the war as victors, and the conquered territories were returned to British rule, the costs of the war and the nationalist fervour that it had stoked became a catalyst for the [[decolonisation]] which took place in the following decades.

== Pre-war plans for defence ==
From 1923, defence of British colonies and protectorates in [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] was centred on the "[[Singapore strategy]]".  This made the assumption that Britain could send a fleet to its naval base in [[Singapore]] within two or three days of a Japanese attack, while relying on [[France]] to provide assistance in Asia via its colony in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] and, in the event of war with [[Italy]], to help defend British territories in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLouis|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;315&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-war planners did not anticipate the fall of France:  Nazi occupation, the loss of control over the [[English Channel|Channel]], and the employment of French Atlantic ports as forward bases for U-boats directly threatened Britain itself, forcing a significant reassessment of  naval defence priorities.

During the 1930s, a triple threat emerged for the British Commonwealth in the form of right-wing, militaristic governments in Germany, Italy and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBrown|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;284&lt;/ref&gt;  Germany threatened Britain itself, while Italy and Japan's imperial ambitions looked set to clash with the British imperial presence in the Mediterranean and East Asia respectively.  However, there were differences of opinion within the UK and the Dominions as to which posed the most serious threat, and whether any attack would come from more than one power at the same time.

== Declaration of war against Germany ==
[[File:Nla.pic-an23217367-v.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Robert Menzies|Sir Robert Menzies]] broadcasting to [[Australia]] the news of the outbreak of war, 1939]]
On 1 September 1939, Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]]. Two days later, on 3 September, after a British ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany. Britain's declaration of war automatically committed [[British Raj|India]], the [[Crown colonies]], and the [[protectorates]], but the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] had granted autonomy to the [[British Dominions|Dominions]] so each decided their course separately.

[[Australia]]n Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] immediately joined the British declaration on 3 September, believing that it applied to all subjects of the Empire and Commonwealth. [[New Zealand]] followed suit simultaneously, at 9.30 pm on 3 September (local time), after [[Peter Fraser (New Zealand politician)|Peter Fraser]] consulted the  [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]; although as Chamberlain's broadcast was drowned by static, the Cabinet (led by Fraser as Prime Minister [[Michael Joseph Savage|Mickey Savage]] was terminally ill) delayed until the Admiralty announced to the fleet a state of war, then backdated the declaration to 9.30 pm. [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] took three days to make its decision (on 6 September), as the Prime Minister General [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] favoured [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] but was defeated by the pro-war vote in the Union Parliament, led by General [[Jan Smuts]], who then replaced Hertzog. Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]] declared support for Britain on the day of the British declaration, but also stated that it was for Parliament to make the formal declaration, which it did so one week later on 10 September. The [[Irish Free State]], which had been a dominion until 1937, remained [[Irish neutrality|neutral]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBrown|Brown]], pp.&amp;nbsp;307–9&lt;/ref&gt;

While the war was initially intended to be limited, resources were mobilized quickly, and the first shots were fired almost immediately. Just hours after the Australian declaration of war, a gun at [[Fort Queenscliff]] fired across the bows of a ship as it attempted to leave [[Melbourne]] without required clearances.&lt;ref&gt;McKernan (1983). p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October 1939, an aircraft of [[No. 10 Squadron RAAF]] based in England became the first Commonwealth air force unit to go into action when it undertook a mission to [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="Stephens 76–79"&gt;Stephens (2006). pp. 76–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Canadian convoy of 15 ships bearing war goods departed [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] just six days after the nation declared war, with two destroyers {{HMCS|St. Laurent}} and {{HMCS|Saguenay}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Byers, A.R. |title=The Canadians at War 1939–45 |location=Westmount, QC |publisher=The Readers' Digest Association |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-88850-145-5 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further 26 convoys of 527 ships sailed from Canada in the first four months of the war,&lt;ref&gt;Hague, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1 January 1940 Canada had landed an entire [[1st Canadian Infantry Division|division]] in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Byers, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 June 1940 Canadian troops deployed to France in an attempt to secure the southern flank of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] in Belgium. As the fall of France grew imminent, Britain looked to Canada to rapidly provide additional troops to strategic locations in North America, the Atlantic and Caribbean. Following the Canadian destroyer already on station from 1939, Canada provided troops from May 1940 to assist in the defence of the British Caribbean colonies, with several companies serving throughout the war in Bermuda, Jamaica, the Bahamas and British Guiana. Canadian troops were also sent to the defence of the [[colony of Newfoundland]], on Canada's east coast, the closest point in North America to Germany. Fearing the loss of a land link{{clarify|date=March 2017}} to the British Isles, Canada was also requested to also occupy Iceland, which it did from June 1940 to the spring of 1941, following the [[Invasion of Iceland|initial British invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;Stacey 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

From mid-June 1940, following the rapid German invasions and occupations of [[Invasion of Poland|Poland]], [[Operation Weserübung|Denmark]], [[Operation Weserübung|Norway]], [[Battle of France|France]], [[Battle of Belgium|Belgium]], [[German invasion of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] and the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], the British Commonwealth was the main opponent of Germany and the [[Axis powers|Axis]], until the entry into the war of the [[Soviet Union]] in June 1941. During this period Australia, India, New Zealand and South Africa provided dozens of ships and several divisions for the defence of the Mediterranean, Greece, Crete, Lebanon and  [[Egypt]], where British troops were outnumbered four to one by the Italian armies in [[Italian Libya|Libya]] and [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]] pp.&amp;nbsp;336–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grey (2008). pp. 156–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Canada delivered a further [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division]], pilots for two air squadrons, and several warships to Britain to face a possible invasion from the continent.

In December 1941, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] launched, in quick succession, attacks on British [[Malayan Campaign|Malaya]], the United States naval base at [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]].

Substantial financial support was provided by Canada to the UK and Commonwealth dominions, in the form of over $4 billion in aid through the [[Billion Dollar Gift and Mutual Aid]] and the [[Billion Dollar Gift and Mutual Aid|War Appropriation Act]]. Over the course of the war over 1.6 million Canadians served in uniform (out of a prewar population of 11 million), in almost every theatre of the war, and by war's end the country had the third-largest navy and fourth-largest air force in the world. By the end of the war, almost a million Australians had served in the [[Australian Defence Force|armed forces]] (out of a population of under 7 million), whose military units fought primarily in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]], [[North African campaign|North Africa]], and the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]].

The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] (also known as the "Empire Air Training Scheme") was established by the governments of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK resulting in:
* joint training at flight schools in Canada, [[Southern Rhodesia]], Australia and New Zealand;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;310&lt;/ref&gt;
* formation of new squadrons of the Dominion air forces, known as "[[Article XV squadrons]]" for service as part of [[Royal Air Force]] operational commands, and;
* in practice, the pooling of RAF and Dominion air force personnel, for posting to both RAF and Article XV squadrons.

===Finances===
Britain borrowed everywhere it could and made heavy purchases of munitions and supplies in India and Canada during the war, as well as other parts of the Empire and neutral countries. Canada also made gifts. Britain's sterling balances around the world amounted to ₤3.4 billion in 1945 or the equivalent of about $US 200 billion in 2016 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.uwyo.edu/numimage/currency.htm "Pounds Sterling to Dollars: Historical Conversion of Currency"]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Britain treated this as a long-term loan with no interest and no specified repayment date. Just when the money would be made available by London was an issue, for the British treasury was nearly empty by 1945. &lt;ref&gt;Marcelo de Paiva Abreu, "India as a creditor: sterling balances, 1940-1953."

== Crisis in the Mediterranean ==
[[File:Indian Wrens Visit Rosyth, 3 June 1945 A29070.jpg|thumb|Second Officer Kalyan Sen and Chief Officer Margaret L Cooper, Women's Royal Indian Naval Service, 1945]]
In June 1940, France [[Battle of France|surrendered]] to invading German forces, and Italy joined the war on the Axis side, causing a reversal of the Singapore strategy.  [[Winston Churchill]], who had replaced [[Neville Chamberlain]] as British [[Prime Minister]] the previous month (see [[Norway debate]]), ordered that the [[Middle East]] and the [[Mediterranean]] were of a higher priority than the Far East to defend.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLouis|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;335&lt;/ref&gt;  Australia and New Zealand were told by telegram that they should turn to the United States for help in defending their homeland should Japan attack:&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]] p.&amp;nbsp;339&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Without the assistance of France we should not have sufficient forces to meet the combined German and Italian navies in European waters and the Japanese fleet in the Far East.  In the circumstances envisaged, it is most improbable that we could send adequate reinforcements to the Far East. We should therefore have to rely on the United States of America to safeguard our interests there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;317&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Commonwealth forces played a major role in North and East Africa following Italy's entry to the war, participating in the invasion of Italian [[Libya]] and [[Italian Somaliland|Somaliland]], but were forced to retreat after Churchill diverted resources to Greece and Crete.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]] p.&amp;nbsp;337&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fall of Singapore ==
{{main article|Fall of Singapore}}
The Battle of Singapore was fought in the [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II|South-East Asian theatre]] of World War II when the [[Japanese Empire]] invaded [[Malayan Campaign|British Malaya]] and its stronghold of [[Singapore]]. Singapore was the major British military base in [[South East Asia]] and nicknamed the [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|"Gibraltar of the East"]]. The fighting in Singapore lasted from 31 January 1942 to 15 February 1942. It followed a [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|humiliating naval engagement]] in December 1941 in which two British capital ships were sunk.

It resulted in the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]] to the Japanese, and the largest [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] of British-led military personnel in history.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Colin|title=Singapore Burning: Heroism and Surrender in World War II|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2006|isbn=0-14-101036-3}}{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 80,000 [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Australian]] and [[British Raj|Indian]] troops became [[prisoners of war]], joining 50,000 taken by the Japanese in the [[Battle of Malaya|Malayan campaign]]. Britain's Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] called the ignominious fall of Singapore to the Japanese the "worst disaster" and "largest capitulation" in British history.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston (1986).

== Africa ==

Africa was a large continent whose geography gave it strategic importance during the war. North Africa was the scene of major campaigns against Italy and Germany; East Africa was the scene of a major campaign against Italy.  The vast  geography provided major transportation routes linking the United States to the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. The sea route around South Africa was heavily used even though it added 40 days to voyages that had to avoid the dangerous Suez region. Lend Lease supplies to Russia often came this way. Internally, long-distance road and railroad connections facilitated the British war effort. The Union of Africa had dominion status and was largely self-governing, the other British possessions were ruled by the colonial office, usually with close ties to local chiefs and kings. France had extensive possessions in Africa, but they played a much smaller role in the war, since they were largely tied to Vichy France.  Portuguese holdings played a minor role. Italian holdings were the target of successful British military campaigns. The Belgian Congo, and two other Belgian colonies, were major exporters. In terms of numbers and wealth, the British -controlled the richest portions of Africa, and made extensive use not only of the geography, but the manpower, and the natural resources.  Civilian colonial officials made a special effort to upgrade the African infrastructure, promote agriculture, integrate colonial Africa with the world economy, and recruit over a half million soldiers. &lt;ref&gt;  Ashley Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 171-239. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Killingray and Richard Rathbone, edfs. ''Africa and the Second World War'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the war, Britain had made few plans for the utilization of Africa, but it quickly set up command structures. The Army set up the West Africa Command, which recruited 200,000 soldiers. The East Africa Command was created in September 1941 to support the overstretched Middle East Command. The Southern Command was the domain of South Africa. The Royal Navy set up the South Atlantic Command based in Sierra Leone, that became one of the main convoy assembly points. The RAF Coastal Command had major submarine-hunting operations based in West Africa, while a smaller RAF command Dealt with submarines in the Indian Ocean. Ferrying aircraft from North America and Britain was the major mission of the Western Desert Air Force. In addition smaller more localized commands were set up throughout the war.&lt;ref&gt;  Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 175-77. &lt;/ref&gt;

Before the war, the military establishments were very small throughout British Africa, and largely consisted of whites, who comprised only two percent of the population outside Africa.   As soon as the war began, newly created African units were set up, primarily by the Army.  The new recruits were almost always volunteers, usually provided in close cooperation with local tribal leaders. During the war, military pay scales far exceeded what civilians natives could earn, especially when food, housing and clothing allowances are included. The largest numbers were in construction units, called Pioneer Units, with over 82,000 soldiers.. The RAF and Navy also did some recruiting. East Africa provided the largest number of men, over 320,000, chiefly from Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. They did some fighting, a great deal of guard duty, and construction work. 80,000 served in the Middle East. A special effort was made not to challenge white supremacy, certainly before the war, and to a large extent during the war itself. Nevertheless, the soldiers were drilled and train to European standards, given strong doses of propaganda, and learn leadership and organizational skills that proved essential to the formation of nationalistic and independence movements after 1945. There were minor episodes of discontent, but nothing serious, among the natives.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) pp 180-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Afrikaner nationalism was a factor in South Africa, But the proto-German Afrikaner prime minister was replaced in 1939 by [[Jan Smuts during World War II|Jan Smuts]], an Afrikaner who was An enthusiastic supporter of the British Empire. His government closely cooperated with London and raised 340,000 volunteers (190,000 were white, or about one-third of the eligible white men).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) pp 240-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious tension erupted over American support for [[British Raj|independence for India]], a proposition Churchill vehemently rejected.&lt;ref&gt;William Roger Louis, ''Imperialism at Bay: The United States and the Decolonization of the British Empire, 1941-1945'' (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew N.

It fought as part of the Japanese invasion of Burma and eastern India. There was a large pacifist element, which rallied to Gandhi's call for abstention from the war; he said that violence in every form was evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Herman|title=Gandhi &amp; Churchill: The Epic Rivalry That Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdPmzLtU5G4C|year=2008|pages=472–539}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a high level of religious tension between the Hindu majority and the Muslims minority. For the first time the Muslim community became politically active, giving strong support for the British war effort. Over 2 million Indians volunteered for military service, including a large Muslim contingent. The British were sensitive to demands of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]], led by [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], since it needed Muslim soldiers in India and Muslim support all across the Middle East. London used the religious tensions in India as a justification to continue its rule, saying it was needed to prevent religious massacres of the sort that did happen in 1947. The imperialist element in Britain was strongly represented in the Conservative party; Churchill himself had long been its leading spokesman. On the other hand, Attlee and the Labour Party favoured independence and had close ties to the Congress Party. The British cabinet sent Sir [[Stafford Cripps]] to India with a [[Cripps Mission|specific peace plan]] offering India the promise of dominion status after the war. Congress demanded independence immediately and the Cripps mission failed.  Roosevelt gave support to Congress, sending his representative Louis Johnson to help negotiate some sort of independence. Churchill was outraged, refused to cooperate with Roosevelt on the issue, and threatened to resign as prime minister if Roosevelt pushed too hard.  Roosevelt pulled back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Warren F.

Meanwhile, wartime disruptions caused severe food shortages in eastern India; hundreds of thousands died of starvation.

The 2 million Indian soldiers were a major factor in British success in the Middle East. Muslim support for the British war effort proved decisive in the British decision to partition the Raj, forming of the new state of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Eric S.

[[File:News. V.E. Day BAnQ P48S1P12270.jpg|thumb|The front page of [[:en:Montreal Star|The Montreal Daily Star]] announcing the German surrender. May 7, 1945]]

On 8 May 1945,  the [[World War II]] [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] formally accepted the [[unconditional surrender]] of the armed forces of [[Nazi Germany]] and the end of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. The formal surrender of the occupying German forces in the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|Channel Islands]] was not until 9 May 1945. On 30 April [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler committed suicide]] during the [[Battle of Berlin]], and so the surrender of Germany was authorized by his replacement, President of Germany [[Karl Dönitz]].  The ''[[German Instrument of Surrender|act of military surrender]]'' was signed on 7 May in [[Reims]], France, and ratified on 8 May in [[Berlin]], Germany.

In the afternoon of 15 August 1945, the [[Surrender of Japan]] occurred, effectively ending [[World War II]]. On this day the initial announcement of Japan's surrender was made  in Japan, and because of time zone differences it was announced in the United States, Western Europe, the Americas, the Pacific Islands, and Australia/New Zealand on 14 August 1945.  The signing of the surrender document occurred on 2 September 1945.

== Aftermath ==
By the end of the war in August 1945, British Commonwealth forces were responsible for the civil and/or military administration of a number of non-Commonwealth territories, occupied during the war, including [[Italian Eritrea#British occupation and the end of the colony|Eritrea]],  [[British Military Administration (Libya)|Libya]], Madagascar, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, [[Italian Somaliland#British Military Administration (1941-1949)|Italian Somaliland]], Syria, Thailand and portions of Germany, Austria and Japan. Most of these military administrations were handed over to old European colonial authorities or to new local authorities soon after the end of the hostilities. Commonwealth forces administered occupation zones in [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force|Japan]], [[Allied-occupied Germany#Occupation Zones|Germany]] and [[Allied-occupied Austria|Austria]] until 1955. 
World War II confirmed that Britain was no longer the great power it had once been, and that it had been surpassed by the United States on the world stage. Canada, Australia and New Zealand moved within the orbit of the United States. The image of imperial strength in Asia had been shattered by the Japanese attacks, and British prestige there was irreversibly damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]], p.&amp;nbsp;341&lt;/ref&gt;  The price for India's entry to the war had been effectively a guarantee for independence, which came within two years of the end of the war, relieving Britain of its most populous and valuable colony. The deployment of 150,000 Africans overseas from British colonies, and the stationing of white troops in Africa itself led to revised perceptions of the Empire in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]], p.&amp;nbsp;342&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
In terms of actual engagement with the enemy, historians have recounted a great deal in South Asia and Southeast Asia, as summarized by [[Ashley Jackson (historian)|Ashley Jackson]]:
:Terror, mass migration, shortages, inflation, blackouts, air raids, massacres, famine, forced labour, urbanization, environmental damage, occupation [by the enemy], resistance, collaboration – all of these dramatic and often horrific phenomena shaped the war experience of Britain's imperial subjects. &lt;ref&gt;Ashley Jackson, "The British Empire" in {{cite book|author=Richard Bosworth and Joseph Maiolo, eds.|title=The Cambridge History of the Second World War: Volume 2, Politics and Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxb_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT880|year=2015|page=559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British historians of the Second World War have not emphasized the critical role played by the Empire in terms of money, manpower and imports of food and raw materials.&lt;ref&gt; for survey see Ashley Jackson,  "The British Empire and the Second World War" [https://britishempireatwardotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/prologue.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;For comprehensive coverage and up-to-date bibliography see [https://britishempireatwar.org/ "The British Empire at War Research Group"]&lt;/ref&gt; The powerful combination meant that Britain did not stand alone against Germany, it stood at the head of a great but fading empire. As Ashley Jackson has argued," The story of the British Empire's war, therefore, is one of Imperial success in contributing toward Allied victory on the one hand, and egregious Imperial failure on the other, as Britain struggled to protect people and defeat them, and failed to win the loyalty of colonial subjects." &lt;ref&gt; Ashley Jackson,  "The British Empire, 1939-1945 " in Richard J. B. Bosworth and Joseph A. Maiolo, eds., ''The Cambridge History of the Second World War: Volume II Politics and Ideology'' (2015) pp 558-580, quote on p 559.&lt;/ref&gt;  The contribution in terms of soldiers numbered 2.5 million men from India, over 1 million from Canada, just under 1 million from Australia, 410,000 from South Africa, and 215,000 from New Zealand. In addition, the colonies mobilized over 500,000 uniformed personnel who serve primarily inside Africa. &lt;ref&gt; Jackson, p 563. &lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of financing, the British war budget included £2.7 billion borrowed from the Empire's Sterling Area, And eventually paid back.  Canada [[Billion Dollar Gift and Mutual Aid|made  C$3 billion in gifts and loans]] on easy terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Geyer and Adam Tooz, eds.e|title=The Cambridge History of the Second World War: Volume 3, Total War: Economy, Society and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xb_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT80|year=2015|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1388">A '''Bunch of Guys''' (BOGs), or '''Group of Guys''' (GOGs) are terms used by [[counter-terrorism]] officials to refer to small, self-organizing [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[covert_cell|cells]].&lt;ref name='latimes-sg'&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-homegrown16aug16,0,372883.story Small Groups Seen as Biggest Threat in US], ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt;   BOGs typically have little to no contact with global terrorist groups like [[al Qaeda]], so they independently plan and execute their own operations with no outside guidance.  BOGs are usually anonymous groups of disaffected amateurs who "self-radicalize".&lt;ref name='ct-htp'&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-terror_thuaug16,1,7257689.story NYPD Warns of Homegrown Terror Plots], ''Chicago Tribune''&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Bunch of Guys" was popularized by [[Marc Sageman]], author of the book "Leaderless Jihad."&lt;ref name='latimes-sg'/&gt;

In 2000, Canadian authorities determined that a small group of angry [[Algeria|Algerian]] men were harmless, and called them just a "bunch of guys."  One of the group's members, [[Ahmed Ressam]], was later detained with a load of [[nitroglycerin]] and timing devices that he planned to use in a terror attack at [[Los Angeles International Airport]].

'''Comprehensive Area Assessment''', or CAA, is a new way of assessing local public services in England that was introduced by the Government in April 2009. It examines how well councils and other public bodies work together to meet the needs of the people they serve.

Every year six independent inspectorates will provide a joint assessment of what it is like to live in each area of England, and assess the prospects for sustainable improvement in the future. The inspectorates involved in CAA are the '''[[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]]''', '''[[Ofsted]]''', '''[[Care Quality Commission]]''' and Her Majesty's Inspectorates of [[Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary|Constabulary]], of [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons|Prisons]], and of [[HM Inspectorate of Probation|Probation]].

The results of these assessments will be available to the public from 10 December 2009 on a new website called Oneplace.

Through CAA, local public services – including councils, health bodies, police forces, fire and rescue services - will be held collectively to account for their impact on improving quality of life for residents.

CAA focuses on what is preventing improvement, and identifying success and innovation that others can learn. CAA looks at what matters locally, covering issues like increasing affordable housing, reducing the fear of crime, improving education, attracting investment or reducing the area's carbon footprint. The issues assessed in each area will reflect local priorities for improving quality of life and protecting the most vulnerable.

Further information about CAA can be found here. [http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/cpa/cpatransition.asp]

The 1998 [[Türkbank scandal]] led to a no-confidence vote and the resignation of Prime Minister [[Mesut Yılmaz]]. Although Yılmaz was investigated by Parliament, a five-year statute of limitations prevented further action.&lt;ref&gt;Zeynep Sarlak and Besim Bulent Bali (2007), [http://kops.ub.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-46602/Corruptionjn_Turkey.pdf?sequence=1 Corruption in Turkey:“Is the donor content when the recipient is content?!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011012/http://kops.ub.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/urn%3Anbn%3Ade%3Absz%3A352-opus-46602/Corruptionjn_Turkey.pdf?sequence=1 |date=2013-12-03 }}, University of Konstanz Discussion Paper Series 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeynep Sarlak and Besim Bulent Bali (2008), [http://kops.ub.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-116452/Corruption_Sarlak.pdf Corruption in Turkey: Why cannot an urgent problem be a main concern?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319121245/http://kops.ub.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/urn%3Anbn%3Ade%3Absz%3A352-opus-116452/Corruption_Sarlak.pdf |date=2013-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 December 2013, the sons of three Turkish ministers and many prominent businesspeople were [[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey|arrested and accused of corruption]].

=={{anchor|Anti-Corruption Legislation}}Anti-Corruption Legislation==
Anti-Corruption legislation includes Turkey's Criminal Code which criminalizes various forms of corrupt activity, including active and passive bribery, attempted corruption, extortion, bribing a foreign official, money laundering and abuse of office. Nevertheless, anti-corruption laws are poorly enforced, and anti-corruption authorities are deemed ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/turkey/show-all.aspx|website=Business Anti-Corruption Profile|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Potential effects on economy}}Potential economic effects==
[[Corruption]] has slowed business activity and the growth of the Turkish economy. Practices indicative of corruption include [[bribery]], [[embezzlement]], [[theft]] and [[fraud]].

==={{anchor|Economic growth}}Growth===
Corruption affects the institutional structures promoting growth in Turkey:
* [[Right to property|Property rights]]: If government officials are bribed to seize properties from people, investments decrease as potential investors lose confidence.
* [[Patent]]s and [[copyright]]s: Corruption increases theft and fraud, decreasing the flow of innovative technology. 
* Efficient [[financial institution]]s: Corruption decreases the efficiency of financial institutions, such as banks. Corrupt government officials have collaborated with large banks to manipulate the country’s economy for their gain, decreasing trust placed in the banking system.
* [[Literacy]] and universal [[education]]: Corrupt government officials decrease spending on [[infrastructure]] and [[education]], using the money saved for speculation. 
* [[Free trade]]: Domestic businesses bribe government officials to raise [[tariff]]s, decreasing demand for imports and increasing demand for domestic goods.
* Competitive [[market system]]: Although Turkish law usually requires [[Procurement|competitive bidding]], some businesses attempt bribery to gain protection and [[Ingroups and outgroups|favoritism]] from the government. A reduction in competitiveness can reduce market efficiency, encouraging [[Monopoly|monopolies]] and [[Oligopoly|oligopolies]].

==={{anchor|Economic development}}Development===
{{See also|Economic development}}
Economic development is the increase in [[standard of living]] and economic health of a country, reflected in its [[Human Development Index]]. For a country to develop economically it must invest in [[capital good]]s, such as [[infrastructure]], [[health care]] and [[education]]. Unlike [[Final good|consumer goods]], which promote immediate wealth for a nation, capital goods promote future development and a higher standard of living.

Corruption affects economic development in the following ways:
* Decreased spending on capital goods: A corrupt government spends less on capital goods, such as health care and education. This affects a country's population as its [[standard of living]] stalls or falls. In Turkey, 79.6 percent of [[health-care costs]] are covered by the [[Social Security Institution]] (Sosyal Güvenlik Kurumu).
* Abuses of power: Corruption encourages a government to use its power in ways detrimental to the majority of its citizens.
* Misappropriation of funds: To reduce (or avoid) taxation corrupt government officials often send their money overseas, reducing the [[money supply]]. A loss of money encourages the printing of more money, triggering [[inflation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7414">The '''Dumbarton Oaks Conference''' or, more formally, the '''Washington Conversations on International Peace and Security Organization''' was an international conference at which the [[United Nations]] was formulated and negotiated among international leaders. The conference was held at [[Dumbarton Oaks]], in Washington, D.C., from August 21, 1944, to October 7, 1944.

[[File:Dumbarton Oaks - house photo with snow.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Dumbarton Oaks]] in Washington, D.C., was the location of the conference.]]

==Overview==
The Dumbarton Oaks Conference constituted the first important step taken to carry out paragraph 4 of the [[Declaration of the Four Nations|Moscow Declaration of 1943]], which recognized the need for a postwar international organization to succeed the [[League of Nations]]. At the conference, delegations from Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States deliberated over proposals for the establishment of an organization to maintain peace and security in the world. Among the representatives were the British Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir [[Alexander Cadogan]]; Soviet Ambassador to the United States, [[Andrei Gromyko]]; Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, [[Wellington Koo]]; and U.S. Under-Secretary of State [[Edward Reilly Stettinius, Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |year=1944 |title=Video: Allies Study Post-War Security Etc. (1944) |url=https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.39024 |publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]] |accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; each of whom chaired his respective delegation. (When Cadogan was called back to London after the first half of the conference, leadership of the delegation was assumed by [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax]], the British ambassador in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reston|first=James B.|title=China Takes Place in Security Talks; Soviet Phase Ends}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The conference itself was chaired by Stettinius,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/st/Stettini.html Stettinius, Edward Reilly, Jr. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-07] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211155740/http://www.bartleby.com/65/st/Stettini.html |date=February 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and U.S. Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] delivered the opening address.

The conversations were held in two phases, since the Soviets were unwilling to meet directly with the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reston|first=James B.|title=World Plan Talks Will Start Today|url=http://search.proquest.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/docview/106797230?accountid=11311|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=21 August 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first phase, representatives of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States convened between August 21 and September 28. In the second, representatives of Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and the United States held discussions between September 29 and October 7.

==Setting==
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2017}}
[[Robert Woods Bliss]], who with his wife, [[Mildred Barnes Bliss]], had given Dumbarton Oaks to [[Harvard University]] in 1940 to establish a scholarly research institute and museum in Byzantine studies, was instrumental in arranging for these meetings. Already in June 1942—on behalf of the director, John S. Thacher, and the Trustees for Harvard University—he had offered to place the facilities of Dumbarton Oaks at the disposal of Secretary Hull. When in June 1944 the State Department found that Dumbarton Oaks could "comfortably accommodate" the delegates and that "the environment [was] ideal", the offer was renewed by [[James Bryan Conant|James B. Conant]], the president of Harvard University, in a letter of June 30, 1944.

==Goals and outcomes==
The stated purposes of the proposed international organization were:
#To maintain international peace and security; and to that end to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace and the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means adjustment or settlement of international disputes which may lead to a breach of the peace;
#To develop friendly relations among nations and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;
#To achieve international co-operation in the solution of international economic, social and other humanitarian problems; and
#To afford a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the achievement of these common ends.

On October 7, 1944, the delegates agreed on a tentative set of proposals ([http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1944/441007a.html Proposals for the Establishment of a General International Organization]) to meet these goals. The discussions at the conference regarding the make-up of the United Nations included which states would be invited to become members, the formation of the [[United Nations Security Council]], and the right of veto that would be given to [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members of the Security Council]]. [[Charles E. Bohlen]] writes that the Dumbarton Oaks Conference "settled all but two issues regarding the organization of the United Nations—the voting procedure in the Security Council and the Soviet pressure for the admission of all sixteen of the Soviet republics to the General Assembly.  Apparently, it never occurred to anyone on the American side to counter with a proposal that all 48 of the U.S. states be admitted to the General Assembly.  It took the [[Yalta Conference|conference at Yalta]], plus further negotiations with Moscow, before these issues were solved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohlen|first=C.E.|title=Witness to History, 1929–1969|year=1973|location=New York|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also at Yalta, a [[United Nations trust territories|trusteeship system]] was proposed to take the place of the [[League of Nations mandate]] system. At the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]], also known as the San Francisco Conference, in April–June 1945, the Security Council veto powers were established and the text of the [[United Nations Charter]] was finalized.

During its final decade he emerged as an opponent of the [[East Germany|East German]] [[Single-party state|one-]][[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] dictatorship, becoming a member of the [[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|League of Evangelical Churches in the German Democratic Republic (''Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR''/BEK)]]. Since the [[Die Wende|collapse]] of the East German political regime in 1989/90 he has participated prominently on committees and as an author seeking to understand and evaluate it.&lt;ref name=ENSpiegel351993&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13682109.html|title= Stasi Stolpes Verrat an der Kirche|date=30 August 1993|volume=35/1993|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] (online)| accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ENlautDNB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&amp;query=115786155 |title=Literatur von und über Ehrhart Neubert| publisher=Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, Frankfurt am Main |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Neubert was born into the family of a Protestant minister in 1940 in [[Herschdorf]], a hillside village near [[Erfurt]] in central southern Germany. He grew up in nearby [[:de:Großenbehringen|Großenbehringen]]. Between 1958 and 1963 he studied [[Theology]] at [[University of Jena|Jena]]. After 1964 he worked at [[:de:Niedersynderstedt|Niedersynderstedt]] initially as a vicar and later as the minister in charge for the parish. From 1973 he was combining his parish duties with work as a [[:de:Studentenpfarrer|student chaplain]] at nearby [[Weimar]].&lt;ref name=ENlautWerwarwer/&gt; In 1976, probably on the advice of [[Robert Havemann]],&lt;ref name=ENlautEK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddr89.de/ddr89/personen/neubert_e.html|title=Ehrhart Neubert|work=DDR 1989/90|publisher=Erhard Kleps, Berlin|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he joined the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|CDU]], in western Germany a political party of the moderate right, but in the politically and by this time physically [[Inner German border|separated]] eastern German state, one of the so-called "block parties" controlled by the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party of Germany (''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands''/SED)]] party through an organisation known as the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front (''Nationale Front der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik''/NF)]]. In 1984 Neubert resigned from the CDU.&lt;ref name=ENlautrbb/&gt; In 1984 he became community sociology secretary in the Theology Studies department with the Berlin-based [[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|East German League of Evangelical Churches]].&lt;ref name=ENlautWerwarwer/&gt;

From 1967 Ehrhart Neubert was also taking part in various informal discussion groups, focusing on theology, sociology and the interface between them. He was sympathetic to the civil right demands of [[Robert Havemann]], who was seen by the regime as a high-profile political dissident. By 1979 Neubert was participating actively in Peace Groups of the [[:de:Evangelische Studierendengemeinde|Evangelical Students' Association]] and, during then 1980s, in other peace circles. He found himself increasingly in conflict both with the state authorities and with the inherently collaborationist leaderships of the official evangelical churches which were keen to retain a level of recognition and toleration from the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party leadership]]. Neubert also produced a number of quasi-political sociological and theological studies: some of his work appeared in [[West Germany]] under the pseudonym "'''Christian Joachim'''".&lt;ref name=ENlautEK/&gt;

The '''Episcopal Peace Fellowship''' (EPF) is an American peace organization composed of members of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]. It was founded on November 11, 1939 as the Episcopal Pacifist Fellowship by Bishop [[William Appleton Lawrence]], Mrs. Henry Hill Pierce, Rev. [[John Nevin Sayre]] and [[Paul Jones (bishop)|Bishop Paul Jones]] and others with the mission to pray, study and work for peace.  In the 1960s it changed its name.

The EPF has a national office with a small paid staff, and many local chapters (71 as of January 2009).  It urges the broader Episcopal Church, other organizations and people in general to adopt a more peaceful stance on issues such as the [[Iraq War]], [[Iran]], promoting peace in the broader [[Middle East]], [[nuclear weapons]] and [[Cuba]]. It offers Active [[Nonviolence]] Training, takes part in peace demonstrations, helps organize action groups and awards peace prizes to individuals around the world who strive for peace.

It is a sister organization of the [[Anglican Pacifist Fellowship]].

The '''Finnish Security Intelligence Service''' ('''Supo''') ({{lang-fi|Suojelupoliisi (Supo)}}, {{Lang-sv|Skyddspolisen (Skypo)}}, {{Literal translation|protection police}}), formerly the '''Finnish Security Police''', is the [[Security agency|security]] and [[intelligence agency]] of [[Finland]] in charge of [[national security]], such as [[Counterintelligence|counter-intelligence]] and [[counter-terrorism]], under the jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Finland)|Interior Ministry]]. Operational since 1949 and headquartered in [[Helsinki]], Supo had 291 employees and a budget of 27.9 million [[euro]]s in 2016. The Service had a distinct role during the [[Cold War]] in monitoring [[Communism|communists]] as well as in the balance between [[Finnish independence]] and Soviet appeasement ([[finlandization]]); after the 1990s Supo has focused more on countering [[terrorism]] and in the 2010s on preventing [[Hybrid warfare|hybrid operations]].

== History ==

=== During the Cold War ===
The Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) was established on 17 December 1948 upon ratification of the Act and the Decree on the Security Police and became operational at the start of 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Laki suojelupoliisista 17.12.1948/878 ja asetus suojelupoliisista 17.12.1948/879. [Act on the Security Police 17.12.1948/878 and Decree on the Security Police 17.12.1948/879]. (In Finnish).&lt;/ref&gt; Supo was formed to replace its predecessor, the [[State Police (Finland)|State Police]] (Valtiollinen poliisi, Valpo), after communists suffered a defeat in the July 1948 parliamentary elections and the reorganization of Valpo was recommended by a governmental committee in October 1948. In essence, Valpo was abolished by [[Parliament of Finland]] due to the fact that its leadership positions had been filled by [[Communism|communists]] and implicated in erroneous and illegal elements according to a separate governmental committee investigation as well as linked to a number of disappearances in the aftermath of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finland and World War II, 1939-1944|last=Wuorinen|first=John|publisher=Roland Press|year=1948|isbn=|location=New York|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supo.fi/history|title=Supo - History|website=www.supo.fi|language=en|access-date=2017-10-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618235700/http://www.supo.fi/history|archivedate=2017-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ratakatu 12: Suojelupoliisi 1949-2009|last=|first=|publisher=WSOY|year=2010|isbn=|editor-last=Simola|editor-first=Matti|location=Helsinki|pages=|language=fi|trans-title=Ratakatu 12: Security Police 1949-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://jyx.jyu.fi/dspace/handle/123456789/12159|title=Rintamalta Ratakadulle : suomalaiset SS-miehet kommunistisen Valpon kohteina 1945-1948|last=Vertanen|first=Anu|publisher=University of Jyväskylä|year=2005|isbn=|location=Jyväskylä|pages=|language=fi|trans-title=From the Front to Ratakatu : Finnish SS troops as targets for the communist State Police 1945-1948|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302163003/https://jyx.jyu.fi/dspace/handle/123456789/12159|archivedate=2018-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ylioppilaslehti.fi/1999/04/supon-lyhyt-historia-kommunistien-tarkkailusta-kettutyttoihin/|title=Supon lyhyt historia: Kommunistien tarkkailusta kettutyttöihin|last=|first=|date=1999-04-01|work=Ylioppilaslehti|access-date=2017-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023230349/http://ylioppilaslehti.fi/1999/04/supon-lyhyt-historia-kommunistien-tarkkailusta-kettutyttoihin/|archive-date=2017-10-23|dead-url=no|language=fi|trans-title=Short history of Supo: From communist monitoring to fur activists|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:House of Supo.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of the Finnish Security Intelligence Service in [[Punavuori]], [[Helsinki]]|left]]

In general, Finland is described being in a strategic and neutral position between the [[Cold War]] blocks; both sides engaged in intensive intelligence activities in the country. Mostly, Finland was an interest to the superpowers as a buffer zone and as an overflight and military transit route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2011/12/finland-and-american-intelligence|title=Finland and American intelligence - Secret history: How close were Finnish-American relations in the Cold War|last=|first=|date=2011-12-01|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606052355/http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2011/12/finland-and-american-intelligence|archive-date=2017-06-06|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first decades, the main tasks of Supo were to monitor communists, such as the [[Communist Party of Finland]] and [[home Russian]]s, and prevent illegal intelligence, especially [[KGB]] and [[Main Intelligence Directorate|GRU]] espionage. The Service had to work with discretion and caution due to [[finlandization]]—a balance between the [[Independence of Finland|independence]] of Finland and [[appeasement]] to the Soviet Union&lt;nowiki/&gt;. At the same time, Supo had close connections with the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]—although the Service was wary of recording it on paper.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tuomioja.org/kirjavinkit/2009/09/matti-simola-toimittanut-ratakatu-12-suojelupoliisi-1949-2009-wsoy-319-s-hameenlinna-2009/|title=Salaisen palvelun tutkimuksen haasteet|last=Tuomioja|first=Erkki|date=2009-09-08|work=Tuomioja.org|access-date=2017-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024153602/https://tuomioja.org/kirjavinkit/2009/09/matti-simola-toimittanut-ratakatu-12-suojelupoliisi-1949-2009-wsoy-319-s-hameenlinna-2009/|archive-date=2017-10-24|dead-url=no|language=fi-FI|trans-title=Challenges in secret service research|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10224/4054|title=The Cold War and the Politics of History|last=Rentola|first=Kimmo|publisher=Edita Publishing Ltd|year=2008|isbn=978-952-10-4637-7|editor-last=Aunesluoma|editor-first=Juhani|location=Helsinki|pages=269–289|chapter=President Urho Kekkonen of Finland and the KGB|editor-last2=Kettunen|editor-first2=Pauli|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305010917/https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10224/4054|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Urho Kekkonen]] was elected the [[President of Finland]] in 1956, Supo started to transform more into a "presidential police" that gathered information to support the President's domestic and foreign policy decision-making. The shift was partly due to the tense [[Finnish-Soviet Relations|Finnish-Soviet relations]] at the time (see e.g. the [[Night Frost Crisis|night frost]] and [[Note Crisis|note crises]]) as well as Kekkonen's motivation to steer the high-profile Service into alignment with his tactics in handling relations with the [[Soviet Union]]. For example, Kekkonen was kept informed of Finnish communist politicians and their internal discussions as well as was relayed information from foreign intelligence agencies, such as the British [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. After Director Armas Alhava retired in 1972, Kekkonen appointed Arvo Pentti as the new Director—an ally and a fellow politician from the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]]. When Seppo Tiitinen was appointed the new Director in 1978, Kekkonen was still requesting information on political communist movements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Kekkonen kept KGB connections, especially its local Helsinki chief, close and utilized back channels to balance between Western and Soviet interests without provocation, such as during the negotiations on Finland's membership to the [[European Free Trade Association]] in 1962. Similarly, he shifted Supo's counter-intelligence activities to quiet and preventive action. For example, espionage cases were sometimes not submitted to court and KGB diplomats were not declared [[persona non grata]], but instead were quietly asked to leave. When KGB major [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]] defected to the [[United States]] from Helsinki in December 1961, he divulged his knowledge and opinions on KGB networks and interaction in Finland to the CIA. For example, he described President Kekkonen as being "in Soviet service" – Kekkonen was relieved when the CIA and Western intelligence took the claim with reservations. Nevertheless, the revelations prompted Western intelligence to have a more constructive and positive attitude towards Finland and the CIA shared Golitsyn's list of KGB [[intelligence officer]]s to Supo for monitoring.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/rikos/artikkeli/supolla-yhteistyota-seka-lanteen-etta-itaan/2040510|title=Supolla yhteistyötä sekä länteen että itään|last=|first=|date=2009-08-27|work=[[MTV3]]|access-date=2017-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107034352/https://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/rikos/artikkeli/supolla-yhteistyota-seka-lanteen-etta-itaan/2040510|archive-date=2017-11-07|dead-url=no|language=fi|trans-title=Security Police had cooperation with both West and East|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic surveillance of communists was shut down in the early 1980s by President [[Mauno Koivisto]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Service did not gain [[Power of arrest|powers of arrest]] and pre-trial investigation powers until 1 January 1989 due to its predecessors’ colourful actions and history as well as Finland’s sensitive [[foreign policy]] position. Instead, the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Finland)|National Bureau of Investigation]] carried out actual criminal investigations until that point.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1990, [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|West German intelligence]] gave Supo the [[Tiitinen list]], which supposedly contains names of Finns who were believed to have links to [[Stasi]], the [[East Germany|East German]] state security ministry. The list was classified and locked in a safe after Director Seppo Tiitinen and President Mauno Koivisto determined that it was based on vague hints instead of hard evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes2/domestic-news/general/11025-tiitinen-says-he-has-no-recollection-of-names-on-stasi-list-.html|title=Tiitinen says he has no recollection of names on Stasi list|last=|first=|date=2010-05-12|website=www.helsinkitimes.fi|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/supo_determined_to_keep_tiitinen_list_classified/5844276|title=Supo Determined to Keep Tiitinen List Classified|last=|first=|date=2008-07-15|work=Yle Uutiset|access-date=2017-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022193826/https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/supo_determined_to_keep_tiitinen_list_classified/5844276|archive-date=2017-10-22|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in 2002 the Service suspected and questioned Finnish diplomat, [[Alpo Rusi]], of being a Stasi spy. The investigation eventually leaked to national broadcaster [[Yle]]. However, Rusi was cleared of all charges in 2007 after court proceedings and won compensation for damage to his reputation suffered when the case was leaked to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/23/world/europe/23iht-spy.4.9448617.html|title=Cold War list is focus of scandal in Finland|last=Castle|first=Stephen|date=2008-02-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024043210/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/23/world/europe/23iht-spy.4.9448617.html|archivedate=2017-10-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After the Cold War ===

On 1 January 2016, Supo was transferred under the direct control of the Interior Ministry from the National Police Board. Reportedly, the administrative transfer was to ensure that the Service is able to more efficiently conduct its special missions as well as to reinforce its strategic and political direction and clarify its official position both domestically and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-8143123|title=Suojelupoliisi siirtyy suoraan sisäministeriön alaisuuteen ensi vuonna|last=|first=|date=2015-07-09|website=Yle Uutiset|language=fi|trans-title=Finnish Security Intelligence Service will transfer directly under the Interior Ministry next year|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023010556/https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-8143123|archive-date=2017-10-23|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/government_advances_plan_to_move_supo_to_interior_ministry/7713633|title=Government advances plan to move Supo to Interior Ministry|last=|first=|date=2014-12-31|work=Yle Uutiset|access-date=2017-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819061927/https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/government_advances_plan_to_move_supo_to_interior_ministry/7713633|archive-date=2017-08-19|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers reported in November 2016 that Supo was concerned about suspicious land and property transactions made by foreign nationals that could be utilized in [[Hybrid warfare|hybrid operations]], such as to accommodate [[Little green men (Ukrainian crisis)|unmarked military troops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/14331-supo-properties-in-foreign-ownership-may-be-used-to-house-unmarked-military-troops.html|title=Supo: Properties in foreign ownership may be used to house unmarked military troops|last=Teivainen|first=Aleksi|date=2016-11-03|work=Helsinki Times|access-date=2017-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022193403/http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/14331-supo-properties-in-foreign-ownership-may-be-used-to-house-unmarked-military-troops.html|archive-date=2017-10-22|dead-url=no|language=en-gb|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/tabloid_supo_suspects_russia_of_buying_up_finnish_property_for_military_personnel/9266358|title=Tabloid: Supo suspects Russia of buying up Finnish property for military personnel|last=|first=|date=2016-11-01|work=Yle Uutiset|access-date=2017-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023010503/https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/tabloid_supo_suspects_russia_of_buying_up_finnish_property_for_military_personnel/9266358|archive-date=2017-10-23|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A new bill was in process in October 2017 to allow for security authorities to monitor purchases by entities from outside the [[European Union]] (EU) buying property near [[Military base|military installations]] or [[Radio masts and towers|broadcast towers]] in Finland as well as for the State to reclaim or buy strategically important property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/new_law_in_works_to_help_finland_track_land_purchases_by_foreigners/9893377|title=New law in works to help Finland track land purchases by foreigners|last=|first=|date=2017-10-20|work=Yle Uutiset|access-date=2017-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023010420/https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/new_law_in_works_to_help_finland_track_land_purchases_by_foreigners/9893377|archive-date=2017-10-23|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Service was involved in investigating the [[2017 Turku stabbing|Turku stabbing]] of August 2017, which is considered Finland's first suspected [[Terrorism|terrorist]] attack since the end of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9785900|title=Suojelupoliisi: Suomessa epäillään ensimmäistä kertaa terroritekoa – uhka-arvio säilyy ennallaan|last=|first=|date=2017-08-19|website=Yle Uutiset|language=fi|trans-title=Finnish Security Intelligence Service: The first suspected terrorist attack in Finland – threat assessment remains unchanged|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819161542/https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9785900|archive-date=2017-08-19|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.supo.fi/en/news/1/0/threat_assessment_unchanged_for_the_time_being_73980|title=Threat assessment unchanged for the time being|last=|first=|date=2017-08-19|website=Finnish Security Intelligence Service|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302151140/https://www.supo.fi/en/news/1/0/threat_assessment_unchanged_for_the_time_being_73980|archive-date=2018-03-02|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function and organization ==
=== Function ===
The Finnish Security Intelligence Service states that its core functions are [[counterintelligence|counter-intelligence]], [[counter-terrorism]] and other [[National security|national security-related]] work, such as counter-proliferation activities intended to impede the proliferation of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]. It is tasked to prevent events that may cause danger to [[government]] systems, [[Parliamentary Democracy|parliamentary democracy]], or internal and external security of the [[State (polity)|State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supo.fi/en|title=Supo - Frontpage|website=www.supo.fi|language=en|access-date=2017-10-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619011219/http://www.supo.fi/en|archivedate=2017-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global National Security and Intelligence Agencies Handbook|last=|first=|publisher=International Publisher Publications|year=2005|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Encyclopedia of Intelligence and Counterintelligence|last=Carlisle|first=Rodney|date=2015-03-26|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317471776|location=|pages=563|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Service is the responsible authority for national and international cooperation in the fight against terrorism, for preparing and maintaining terrorist threat assessments, for monitoring [[Extremism|extremist]] phenomena, and for performing [[security clearance]]s for personnel recruited into sensitive positions. Supo reports to other security authorities and the [[Government of Finland]] on its activities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://intermin.fi/en/police/agencies-and-responsibilities|title=Agencies and responsibilities|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Interior (Finland)|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809011353/http://intermin.fi/en/police/agencies-and-responsibilities|archive-date=2017-08-09|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the Police Act, Supo can utilize, among others, traffic data monitoring, covert intelligence gathering, undercover activities, pseudo purchases, and controlled delivery to fulfill its missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2011/en20110872|title=Police Act 872/2011|last=|first=|date=|website=www.finlex.fi|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022193547/http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2011/en20110872|archive-date=2017-10-22|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organization ===
Supo is a national police unit subordinate to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Finland)|Ministry of the Interior.]] It follows a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] tradition where the [[intelligence agency]] is governed as a part of police organisations (i.e. in the form of a security police) instead of being a separate organisation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Service formerly used the English title Finnish Security Police; the word "police" was amended in 2010 to emphasize the agency's role in security intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supo.fi/about_supo|title=Supo - About Supo|website=www.supo.fi|language=en|access-date=2017-10-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827051620/http://www.supo.fi/about_supo|archivedate=2017-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Service had 291 employees, of whom 56% were [[police officer]]s and 40% women, and a total budget of 27.9 million [[euro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.supo.fi/instancedata/prime_product_julkaisu/intermin/embeds/supowwwstructure/72829_SUPO_2016_ENG.pdf?304cc2d77276d488|title=Finnish Security Intelligence Service Yearbook 2016|last=|first=|publisher=Finnish Security Intelligence Service|year=2017|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603024816/http://www.supo.fi/instancedata/prime_product_julkaisu/intermin/embeds/supowwwstructure/72829_SUPO_2016_ENG.pdf?304cc2d77276d488|archivedate=2017-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its headquarters in [[Punavuori]], [[Helsinki]], Supo hosts eight regional offices around Finland in [[Turku]], [[Tampere]], [[Vaasa]], [[Lappeenranta]], [[Joensuu]], [[Kuopio]], [[Oulu]] and [[Rovaniemi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.supo.fi/contact_information|title=Supo - Contact|website=www.supo.fi|language=en|access-date=2017-10-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619015052/http://www.supo.fi/contact_information|archivedate=2017-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Supo has liaison officers posted at [[diplomatic mission]]s in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] and [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]] as well as at the [[European Union Intelligence and Situation Centre|European Union (EU) Intelligence and Situation Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supo.fi/internationality|title=Supo - Internationality|website=www.supo.fi|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618230642/http://www.supo.fi/internationality|archivedate=2017-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Service is divided into seven different departments as of a 2017 reorganization:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;small&gt;The source ''Ratakatu 12: Suojelupoliisi 1949-2009'' was "commissioned by Supo, but it was mainly written by professional historians".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen-Eriksen|first=Niklas|date=2010-12-16|title=Ratakatu 12.

'''''God's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It''''' is a 2005 book by author [[Jim Wallis]]. The book focuses on the role of religious hypocrisy in politics, and critiques both the so-called "[[Christian right|religious right]]" and the "[[secular left]]" while noting that the vast majority on the "left" have families who embrace both family values and religion. His criticism includes quotations from the [[Bible]], as he accuses U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] and many at [[Fox News]] such as [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Sean Hannity]] of practicing bad [[theology]], noting that [[Jesus]] was strictly [[nonviolent]] particularly when it comes to invading other countries such as Iraq where over 600,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed due to the U.S. invasion, while Jesus said more about [[social justice]] while he never said anything against [[homosexuality]]. He defends religion in general, and challenges organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] for overreacting to public displays of religion, although the Founding Fathers of the U.S. clearly intended separation of church and State.

The '''''Guardia di Finanza''''' ('''GdF''') ({{IPA-it|ˈɡwardja di fiˈnantsa}}; {{lang-en|Financial Guard}}) is an Italian [[law enforcement]] agency under the authority of the Minister of Economy and Finance. It is a militarized police force, forming a part of the [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy)|Ministry of Economy and Finance]], not the [[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministry of Defence]].  Guardia di Finanza is essentially responsible for dealing with financial crime and smuggling; it has also evolved into Italy's primary agency for suppressing the [[illegal drug trade]]. It maintains over 600 boats and ships and more than 100 aircraft to serve in its mission of patrolling Italy's [[territorial waters]].

==Mission==
The mission and institutional tasks of Guardia di Finanza are stated in the law 189 of April 23, 1959 and 68/2001 and are subdivided into priority ones (preventing, investigating and reporting financial evasions and violations, overseeing the compliance with the provisions of politico-economic interest and surveillance at sea for financial police purposes) and contribution ones (maintaining public order and safety and political-military defense of the borders).

The primary goal of the Guardia di Finanza is to protect the legal economy and the businesses operating in compliance with the law, while ensuring that the Republic, the European Union, the regions, and the local governments can rely on a regular inflow and appropriate use of the resources meant for the community, and for supporting policies for economic and social revival and development.

Its activities are connected with financial, economic, judiciary and public safety: [[tax evasion]], financial crimes, [[smuggling]], [[money laundering]], international [[Illegal drugs trade|illegal drug trafficking]], [[illegal immigration]], [[customs]] and borders checks, [[copyright violation]]s, anti-[[Mafia]] operations, [[credit card fraud]], [[cybercrime]], [[counterfeiting]], [[terrorist financing]], maintaining [[public order]], and safety, political and military defense of the Italian [[borders]].

== History ==

===Light Troops Legion (1774)===
[[File:guardia.di.finanza.car.arp.jpg|thumb|Guardia di Finanza police in central [[Rome]].]]
[[File:GC202.jpg|thumb|Patrol boat of the Guardia di Finanza.]]

The origins of the Guardia di Finanza date back to October 5, 1774, when the "Light Troops Legion" (''Legione truppe leggere'') was set up under the [[King of Sardinia]], [[Victor Amadeus III]]. This was the first example in Italy of a special corps established and organized for financial surveillance duties along the borders, as well as for military defense.

===Customs Guards Corps (1862)===
Once the [[unification of Italy]] was completed in 1862, the "Customs Guards Corps" (''Corpo delle Guardie doganali'') was set up. Its main task was Customs surveillance and co-participation in the Country's defense during wartime.

===''Corpo della Regia Guardia di Finanza'' (1881)===
By Law no. 141 dated April 8, 1881, the Customs Guards Corps became the "Corps of the Royal Finance Guard" (''Corpo della Regia Guardia di Finanza'') whose task was to "impede, suppress and report smuggling activities and any other violation and transgression of financial laws and regulations", and to safeguard the interests of the tax administration, as well as to co-participate in enforcing law and order and public security.

===Twentieth century===
By Royal Decree dated July 14, 1907, the Corps was issued 5-point star uniforms to mark its military status, even though the Army's military discipline regulation was extended to the Financial Guard by Law dated July 12, 1908. The Corps served in the two [[World Wars]] and in the [[War of National Liberation]], deserving 18 awards to its War Flag, which had been granted in 1914 to decree the total integration among the [[Italian Armed Forces]].

Subsequently, the Corps took part in numerous rescue operations during serious [[natural disasters]]; for this commitment the Corps was decorated with 13 additional civil valor awards.

The re-organization of the police forces in 1919 also affected the Royal ''Guardia di Finanza''. The responsibilities were divided between the Inspector General, who was an Army Officer with the rank of [[Lieutenant General]] responsible for military preparation, and the Commanding [[General]], who was a Financial Guard Officer subordinate to the former, but authorized to maintain direct relations with the Minister for ordinary institutional duties and for [[personnel]] management. In 1923, the "Investigative Tax Police" was set up as a specialized branch of the Royal Financial Guard. Within a few years, its naval fleet, motor-vehicles and telecommunication structure underwent a complete change; the Statistical Service equipped with a data processing centre, the Air Service and the Canine Service (for anti-drugs checks) were set up. During the same years, the Corps’ general organization was defined pursuant to Law no. 189 dated April 23, 1959, which laid down its institutional tasks, subsequently amended by specific sector provisions assigning certain responsibilities.

===Recent history===
Besides the review of its organizational structure, laid out by the issuance of Presidential Decree Law no. 34 dated January 29, 1999, the updating of the Corps’ institutional tasks was completed. Law Decree no. 68, dated March 19, 2001, whilst confirming the Corps’ configuration as a military structure, enhanced its role as a police force having general competence on all economic, financial and judicial matters for the safeguard of the public budget and that of the regions, of the local authorities and of the [[European Union]].

The Guardia di Finanza Historical Museum is custodian of the traditions of the Corps. It preserves artifacts of relevance to the Guardia di Finanza and promotes historical research, to aid researchers, scholars and military history enthusiasts.

===Anti-drug operations===
From the statistic data of the anti-drug service central Direction, of the Department of the Interior,the 60% of the drug seized in Italy by all the strengths of law enforcement is found by the Guardia di Finanza.
In 2005, the Financial Guard was responsible for 77% of the [[Heroin]] seizures, 69% of [[Cocaine]] seizures and 54% of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (including [[Hashish]]) seizures.

===The Chiasso financial smuggling case===
{{main|Chiasso financial smuggling case}}
On June 3, 2009 near [[Chiasso, Switzerland]] (near the Swiss/Italian border), officers of the Corps detained two Japanese nationals in their 50s who had attempted to enter Switzerland and had in their possession a suitcase with a false bottom containing [[United States Treasury security|U.S. Treasury Bonds]] worth $134.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Sequestrati a Chiasso titoli USA per novantasei miliardi di euro |work=Guardia di Finanza website |language=Italian |page= |date=June 4, 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2009 |quote= |url=http://www.gdf.it/gdf__informa/notizie_stampa/adnkronos/adnkronos_2009/adnkronos_giugno_2009/info-1518911049.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613034419/http://www.gdf.it/gdf__informa/notizie_stampa/adnkronos/adnkronos_2009/adnkronos_giugno_2009/info-1518911049.html |archivedate=June 13, 2009 }}

The '''Hartz concept''', also known as '''Hartz reforms''' or the '''Hartz plan''', is a set of recommendations submitted by a committee on reforms to the [[Germany|German]] labour market in 2002. Named after the head of the committee, [[Peter Hartz]], these recommendations went on to become part of the [[Bundesregierung|German government's]] ''[[Agenda 2010]]'' series of reforms, known as Hartz I – Hartz IV. The committee devised thirteen "innovation modules", which recommended changes to the German labour market system. These were then gradually put into practice: The measures of Hartz I – III were undertaken between January 1, 2003, and 2004, while Hartz IV was implemented on January 1, 2005.

The "Hartz Committee" was founded on February 22, 2002, by the federal government of Germany led then by [[Gerhard Schröder]]. Its official name was ''Kommission für moderne Dienstleistungen am Arbeitsmarkt'' (Committee for Modern Services in the Labour Market). The 15-member committee was chaired by [[Peter Hartz]], then [[Volkswagen]]'s personnel director.

==Hartz I, II, and III==
Hartz I and II both came into effect on January 1, 2003, aiming at making new types of jobs easier to create, and covered, for example:

&lt;u&gt;Hartz I&lt;/U&gt;
*The foundation of "Staff Services agencies" (''Personal-Service-Agenturen'' or PSAs).
*Support for vocational further education from the German Federal Labour Agency.
*Subsistence payments by the Federal Labour Agency.

&lt;U&gt;Hartz II&lt;/U&gt;
*New types of employment, [[Minijob]] and [[Midijob]], with lower or gradually rising taxes and insurance payments.
*A grant for entrepreneurs, known as the "Ich-AG"  (''Me, Inc.'').
*A rise in the number of job centres.

&lt;U&gt;Hartz III&lt;/U&gt;
*Hartz III came into effect on January 1, 2004. This measure was aimed at restructuring and reforming [[Job Centre]]s, whose name was changed from the '' Bundesanstalt für Arbeit''  or ''[[Arbeitsamt]]'' (Federal Labour Institution), to the ''Bundesagentur für Arbeit'' or ''[[:de:Agentur für Arbeit|Agentur für Arbeit]]'' (Federal Labour Agency).

==Hartz IV==
The fourth stage of the reform was voted in by the ''[[Bundestag]]'' on December 16, 2003 and by the ''[[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]]'' on July 9, 2004, to take effect by January 1, 2005.

This part of the reforms brought together the former [[unemployment benefits]] for long-term unemployed ('Arbeitslosenhilfe') and the welfare benefits ('Sozialhilfe'), leaving them both at approximately the lower level of the former ''Sozialhilfe'' (social assistance). The level for a single person was [[euro|€]]374 per month (known as the ''Regelsatz''). This was subsequently raised to [[euro|€]]391 per month, in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.focus.de/finanzen/news/acht-euro-mehr-ab-2013-regierung-will-arbeitslosengeld-ii-regelsatz-erhoehen_aid_818685.html "Regierung will Arbeitslosengeld II-Regelsatz erhöhen"] (Government to expand unemployment benefits rules), [[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]] (13 September 2012). Retrieved 02.08.2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Added to this is the financial assistance with housing and health care. Couples can receive benefits for each partner plus their children.

Prior to 2005, between 12 and 36 months (depending upon the claimant's age and work history) of their full unemployment benefit (60 to 67% of the previous net salary) were followed by the  ''Arbeitslosenhilfe'' (unemployment assistance), amounting to 53 to 57% of the last net salary. Since 2008, eligibility for the full unemployment benefit (renamed ''Arbeitslosengeld'' in 2005 and commonly referred to as ''Arbeitslosengeld I'' in everyday German to contrast it with the lower benefits discussed below) has been restricted to 12 months in general, 15 months for those aged 50 or older, 18 months for those 55 or older and 24 months for those 58 or older.

This is now followed by the (usually much lower) ''Arbeitslosengeld II'' (Hartz IV) benefits if the claimant meets eligibility requirements.

Whether or not a claimant is eligible for ''Arbeitslosengeld II'' depends on his or her savings, life insurance and the income of spouse or partner. If these assets are below a threshold level, a claimant can get money from the state. The threshold level in July 2008 was €150 for free assets (at least €3,100) and €250 for fixed retirement assets, both calculated per capita and lifetime year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/sgb_2/__12.html Text of Social Code (SGB) Second Book (II) – basic security for job seekers – (Article 1 of the Law of 24 December 2003, Federal Law Gazette I p 2954)] (in [[German language|German]])&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, every employable individual in a communal household (persons living in and depending on the resources of the claimant), can have one car worth about €7,500 and a self-used house of 130 square meters living space (more if there are other people in the common household).

To receive payments, a claimant must agree to a contract subject to [[Public law#German-speaking countries|public law]]. This contract outlines what they are obliged to do to improve their job situation, and when the state is obliged to help. An unemployed person may be required to accept any kind of legal job. This compulsion is restricted by constitutional rights, like freedom of movement, freedom of family, marriage and [[Human dignity#Germany|human dignity]]. If taking on a specific placement is deemed reasonable by the responsible agency, not applying will result in a reduction or even complete suspension of the appropriate payment.

Within the ''Arbeitslosengeld II'' schemes, the state covers the health insurance of the unemployed. Until the end of 2010, payments towards the pension scheme of the claimant were also made.

It is possible to earn income from a job and receive ''Arbeitslosengeld II'' benefits at the same time. Job income is debited from ''Arbeitslosengeld II'' payments according to a formula that leaves a certain amount of the additional revenue untouched. These revenues are: a certain amount of savings (which increases with age); €100 plus 20 percent of the wage up to €800 plus 10% of the wage up to €1200 (up to €1500 if there are children). Through this mechanism ''Arbeitslosengeld II'' can be regarded as a sort of [[minimum wage]] floor for employees without assets, where the minimum wage is not fully paid by the employer but assured by the state. There are criticisms that this defies competition and leads to a downward spiral in wages and the loss of full-time jobs.
&lt;!-- PLEASE SOURCE: The basic value of Hartz IV is comparable to a fulltime job with a wage of 5 euros per hour. With the debiting mechanism this would increase to approximately 6.50 euros per hour. A part time job under the "400 Euro Job" law (wages with no social security deductions for the employee) leads to a virtual wage of 6.35 euros per hour, thus making low paid fulltime jobs look unattractive.

Sample calculation: €351 plus housing (about 200 euros), plus a pension scheme (about 90 euros), plus health insurance (worth 200 euros of which only 115 euros are paid) – a total of about 750 euros a month. 750 divided by an average of 19 working days and 8 working hours a day is about 5 euros. User:Diskriminierung --&gt;

The Hartz IV reform merged the federal level unemployment agency with the local level welfare administration. This facilitated a better, case-oriented approach to helping unemployed people find work and improve their situations. The plan's objective is to reduce caseloads from 400 unemployed persons per agent to not more than 75 (aged 25 or less), or not more than 150 persons over the age of 25. For difficult cases, dedicated case managers may be deployed. Legally, however, the agencies remain separate.

The Hartz IV reforms continue to attract criticism in Germany, despite a considerable reduction in short- and long-term unemployment. This reduction has led to some claims of success for the Hartz reforms. Others say the actual unemployment figures are not comparable because many people work part-time or are not included in the statistics for other reasons, such as the number of children that live in Hartz IV households, which has risen to record numbers.

About 7 million people get Hartz IV benefits, of which 2.2 million are unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.observatoiredesgaspillages.com/2014/06/combien-coute-le-rsa/ "Combien coûte le RSA ?"], Observatoire des Gaspillages (02.06.2014).

==Cultural impact==
Although the official term for long-term unemployment benefits is still ''Arbeitslosengeld II'', most Germans, even news programmes and politicians in parliament, refer to it as ''Hartz IV''. The term was voted [[Word of the year (Germany)|German Word of the Year]] 2004 by the [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache|Society for the German Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l41/l0/F.html#featuredEntry "Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort!",] (One year, one (non-)word), ''[[Spiegel Online]]'' (31.10.2011). Retrieved 02.08.2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in 2002, the term ''Ich-AG'' (another Hartz measure, see above) had been chosen as the [[Un-word of the year|German Un-Word of the Year]] by a jury of linguistic scholars.

Meanwhile, ''Hartz IV'' has become a synonym for the class of non-working poor and is used as a prefix in multiple contexts (i.e. low-brow daytime television programmes are called "Hartz IV TV" by critics).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1842">'''[[Homelessness]] in [[Indonesia]]''' is a significant issue, estimated to impact up to 3 million people in the country, over 28,000 in [[Jakarta]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://homelessworldcup.org/homelessness-statistics/|title=Homelessness statistics|website=homlessworldcup.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homelessness in Indonesia is termed ''tunawisma'' and while by the 2000s the issue was recognised by government authorities, there is no generally accepted definition and no reliable data are available but according to the 2000 census, 1.6% of the country's population, about 3.2 million people do not have a permanent place to stay.&lt;ref name=levs&gt;Levinson, David. Encyclopedia of homelessness. Vol. 1. Sage, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Squatters and street homeless people are often targeted by police raids who cite the reason being the homeless people "disturb the attractiveness of the city".&lt;ref name=levs/&gt;

Another term for homelessness in Indonesia is ''gelandangan'', meaning "tramp". The word is derived from ''gelandang'' meaning "to wander".&lt;ref&gt;Tipple, Graham, and Suzanne Speak. "Attitudes to and interventions in Homelessness: Insights from an International Study." In paper delivered to International Conference Adequate and Affordable Housing for All, June, pp. 24-27. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forced evictions==
One cause of homelessness in Indonesia is forced evictions. According to researchers, between the years 2000 and 2005 over 92,000 people were forcefully evicted from their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Rahardjo, Tjahjono. "Forced eviction, homelessness and the right to housing in Indonesia." In conference on Homelessness: A Global Perspective, New Delhi, pp. 9-13. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44597">'''Infectious diseases within American correctional settings''' are a concern within the public health sector. The corrections population is susceptible to infectious diseases through exposure to blood and other bodily fluids, drug injection, poor health care, [[prison overcrowding]], demographics, security issues, lack of community support for rehabilitation programs, and high-risk behaviors.&lt;ref name=Weinbaum&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weinbaum CM, Sabin KM, Santibanez SS |title=Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV in correctional populations: a review of epidemiology and prevention |journal=AIDS |volume=19 Suppl 3 |issue= |pages=S41–6 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16251827 |doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000192069.95819.aa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of [[infectious disease]]s, such as [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] and other sexually transmitted diseases, [[hepatitis C]] (HCV), [[hepatitis B]] (HBV), and [[tuberculosis]] result largely from needle-sharing, drug use, and consensual and [[Prison rape in the United States|nonconsensual sex among prisoners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sean |last=Guillemette |year=2003 |title=The silent killer doing time |url=http://hepatitismag.com/storydetail.asp?storyid=7 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616003127/http://hepatitismag.com/storydetail.asp?storyid=7 |archive-date=June 16, 2007 |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stark&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stark K, Herrmann U, Ehrhardt S, Bienzle U |title=A syringe exchange programme in prison as prevention strategy against HIV infection and hepatitis B and C in Berlin, Germany |journal=Epidemiology and Infection |volume=134 |issue=4 |pages=814–9 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16371183 |pmc=2870452 |doi=10.1017/S0950268805005613 |jstor=3865972}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C need specific attention because of the specific public health concerns and issues they raise.

The implementation of HIV and STD screening programs in the correctional setting is an important approach to reducing the annual number of new HIV infections in the United States. The correctional system in America is a patchwork of a wide variety of settings such as state and federal prisons, local jails, [[juvenile detention center]]s and they include the legal constraints of state laws. One process for HIV testing would be unlikely or even impossible in all correctional settings.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HIV Testing Implementation Guidance for Correctional Settings. January 2009: 1-38. Available at: http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/5279.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an inherent difference in the jail versus the prison setting that merits infectious disease testing at the jail level.  Jails are largely used to hold offenders who have been charged but not convicted of a crime.  Local jails admitted an estimated 11.7 million persons during the 12-month period ending June 30, 2013.  The average weekly turnover rate was 60.2 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Justice Statistics, Revised August 12, 2014 Jail Inmates at Midyear 2013 - Statistical Tables. Available at http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=4988&lt;/ref&gt;  Implementing HIV, HCV and other STD screening programs at the jail level is an effective way to detect disease before an infected individual is released back to the community and is able to transmit disease.

==At-risk diseases==

=== HIV/AIDS ===
{{see also|Prison rape in the United States#Sexually transmitted diseases}}
At least 17% of people living with HIV/AIDS have been incarcerated at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Arp&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arp III |first=William |title=Race, Incarceration and HIV/AIDS in Louisiana: Risky Sexual Behavior Demands Mandatory Testing |journal=Race, Gender, &amp; Class |year=2009 |volume=16 |issue=1/2 |pages=228–37 |jstor=41658870}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of contracting HIV is ten to one hundred times higher inside the prison system than outside.&lt;ref name="Women Prison HIV"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chandler C |title=Death and dying in America: the prison industrial complex's impact on women's health |journal=Berkeley Women's Law Journal |volume=18 |issue= |pages=40–60 |year=2003 |pmid=15199931 |url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/bglj/vol18/iss1/3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incarcerated population is more likely to contract the disease because they are exposed to more high-risk behaviors within the correctional system. In a Louisiana prison study, 242 inmates (72.8% of male inmates) had participated in sexual encounters with other men, and did not always have access to proper protection.&lt;ref name="Arp"/&gt; Additionally, research has demonstrated that infection rates via injection are much higher among those who have previously served prison terms. Research suggests that elevated rates of infection are a result of increased prison sentencing for drug-related offences and the [[War on Drugs]].&lt;ref name=Hazel&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dean-Gaitor HD, Fleming PL |title=Epidemiology of AIDS in incarcerated persons in the United States, 1994-1996 |journal=AIDS |volume=13 |issue=17 |pages=2429–35 |date=December 1999 |pmid=10597785 |doi=10.1097/00002030-199912030-00015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lynda&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gaiter J, Doll LS |title=Improving HIV/AIDS prevention in prisons is good public health policy |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=86 |issue=9 |pages=1201–3 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8806366 |pmc=1380577 |doi=10.2105/ajph.86.9.1201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since prisons generally divide the individuals by gender, the populations experience different environments; [[incarceration of women in the United States|incarcerated females in the United States]] tend to have higher rates of infection.&lt;ref name="Women Prison HIV" /&gt;

According to the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics, at the end of 2010 among all of the U.S. inmates with HIV/AIDS 18,337 of them were male and 1,756 were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maruschak |first=Laura M. |date=September 2012 |title=HIV in Prisons, 2001-2010 |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/hivp10.pdf |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests young men of color disproportionately represent U.S. inmates and these individuals may be at such a risk of contracting HIV due to high-risk behavior prior to entering the penitentiary system.  Furthermore, research also shows that AIDS is the single largest cause of death among African American men between ages 25 through 44 years, mainly due to drug-related transmission of the virus.&lt;ref name="Men's Health"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Braithwaite RL, Arriola KR |title=Male prisoners and HIV prevention: a call for action ignored |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=759–63 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12721138 |pmc=1447833 |doi=10.2105/ajph.93.5.759}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2013, condoms for prisoners are only available in the US state of Vermont (on September 17, 2013, the California Senate approved a bill for condom distribution inside the state's prisons, but the bill was not yet law at the time of approval).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everybody wants condom vending machines |url=http://grist.org/list/everybody-wants-condom-vending-machines/ |work=Grist Magazine |accessdate=19 September 2013 |first=Holly |last=Richmond |date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 survey of inmates at state prisons and local jails revealed a self-reported HIV positive rate of 1.9% and 2.5% respectively. Sixty-nine percent of state inmates reported being tested since admission to the system while only 18.5% of those in the jail reported being tested.&lt;ref name="stacks.cdc.gov"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV Testing, http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/5279.&lt;/ref&gt;   This suggests that expanded jail testing could increase the number of previously unidentified cases of HIV.  In prisons, where inmates are incarcerated for more than a year, testing should take place at the medical evaluation.  In jails, where a majority of inmates bail out between 72 hours and seven days, routine testing should ideally take place at the intake evaluation.  This may not be possible if the inmate is under the influence of drugs or alcohol or is otherwise mentally unstable.  While medical evaluations typically occur within 10 days of detention, some inmates may have been released and thus, won't get tested.

=== Hepatitis C ===

While the majority of HCV infections occur outside of prison, the disease is still widespread within the prison system as a result of drug injection.&lt;ref name=Champion&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Champion JK, Taylor A, Hutchinson S, etal |title=Incidence of hepatitis C virus infection and associated risk factors among Scottish prison inmates: a cohort study |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |volume=159 |issue=5 |pages=514–9 |date=March 2004 |pmid=14977648 |doi=10.1093/aje/kwh061}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one Rhode Island prison study, HCV infection was found in 23.1% of the male prison population.&lt;ref name=Macalino&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Macalino GE, Vlahov D, Sanford-Colby S, etal |title=Prevalence and incidence of HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus infections among males in Rhode Island prisons |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=94 |issue=7 |pages=1218–23 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15226146 |pmc=1448424 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.94.7.1218}}&lt;/ref&gt; HCV prevention proved to be more challenging than HIV prevention because inmates partake in high-risk behaviors such as "front loading" and sharing spoons to prepare drugs like [[cocaine]].&lt;ref name=Stark /&gt;  The prevalence of these diseases within prisons is a concern because they pose a potential public health risk. When prisoners are released, they may continue the same behaviors, thereby increasing the chances of the disease spreading to outside communities.&lt;ref name=Macalino /&gt; The ''Western Journal of Medicine'' estimates the prevalence and predictors of HCV infection among inmates of California by conducting a system wide survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ruiz JD, Molitor F, Sun RK, etal |title=Prevalence and correlates of hepatitis C virus infection among inmates entering the California correctional system |journal=The Western Journal of Medicine |volume=170 |issue=3 |pages=156–60 |date=March 1999 |pmid=10214102 |pmc=1305533}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Findings concluded that HCV infection appears most common in men and women entering prison, displaying prevalence of anti-HCV positive highest among white males and Latina women.

Limited testing for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in three North Carolina jails have shown a prevalence rate of approximately 7% for HCV.  The primary barrier is the cost of additional tests needed beyond a screening test.  However, some hematologists believe a screening test should be done regardless of ability to pay for follow-up care as a means of changing behavior (for example, refraining from alcohol or not sharing needles).  Studies have shown that knowledge of disease status can change behavior with HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marks|first1=G|last2=Crepaz|first2=N|last3=Senterfitt|first3=JW|last4=Janssen|first4=R|title=Meta-analysis of high-risk sexual behavior in persons aware and unaware they are infected with HIV in the United States: Implications for prevention programs.|journal=Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes|date=2005|volume=39|issue=4|pages=446–453|doi=10.1097/01.qai.0000151079.33935.79}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is estimated that 80% of people with HIV who inject drugs also have hepatitis C virus. HIV coinfection more than triples the risk for liver disease, liver failure, and liver-related death from HCV.

== Differences in funding for sexually transmitted diseases treatment ==

In 2002, the ''Public Health Reports'' released a study entitled "Comparing Quality of Care for Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Specialized and General Clinics", explaining the quality of care provided in public STD clinics and general medical clinics when treating patients with STDs. In October 1995, the County of Los Angeles Department of Health Services faced a budget deficit that led to the decision of restructuring their outpatient care system. The result of this restructuring led to the following: 17 LA County STD clinics and 3 of general medical clinics were also closed down. This then resulted in the shift of "balance of STD services in favor of general medical clinics." Reduced funding greatly therefore affecting the quality of patient care. Six clinics were studied from March 1, 1996 to June 30, 1996 with the data of patients recorded during each visit. Thirty-two process of care quality indicators were determined that listed patient expectations during visitation. Data showed that the public STD clinics demonstrated a greater adherence than general medical clinics for every 14 out of the 32 patient care quality indicators. As a result, both the general medical clinics and STD clinics suffered from the budget deficit of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Miriti MK, Billah K, Weinbaum C, etal |title=Economic benefits of hepatitis B vaccination at sexually transmitted disease clinics in the U.S |journal=Public Health Reports |volume=123 |issue=4 |pages=504–13 |year=2008 |pmid=18763413 |pmc=2430647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate studies assessed the practicality and cost-efficiency of vaccinating all adults treated at STD clinics in a span of a year. Two scenarios were compared, assuming a national program offering the Hepatitis B vaccine to two million clients in order to create a decision model. The first scenario lacked the Hepatitis B vaccination while the second followed a Hepatitis B vaccination. The stages of the HBV virus were followed in a [[Markov Model of Natural History]]. These are the stages that clients can potentially experience if they opted out of vaccination. Those that chose to be part of a routine vaccination would undergo a three-part vaccination stage within a year. The total medical cost for those who contracted the HBV virus is as follows: $1,587&amp;nbsp;million for societal costs; $346&amp;nbsp;million in medical costs; and $1,241&amp;nbsp;million in productivity losses. The projected cost for a national vaccination program that is to serve more than a million clients is "$138&amp;nbsp;million including $95&amp;nbsp;million for vaccine and administration, $30.5&amp;nbsp;million for staff training and supervision, and $12.2&amp;nbsp;million for protocol development and vaccination record-keeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Asch SM, Sa'adah MG, Lopez R, Kokkinis A, Richwald GA, Rhew DC |title=Comparing quality of care for sexually transmitted diseases in specialized and general clinics |journal=Public Health Reports |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=157–63 |year=2002 |pmid=12357000 |pmc=1497416 |doi=10.1093/phr/117.2.157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Carolina, the state Department of Health and Human Services Division of Epidemiology works with the [[AIDS Drug Assistance Program]] to help pay for HIV medication for incarcerated persons in county jails (state and federal prisons are not eligible).  In order to qualify, county detention centers must complete an application for funds that includes the jail health budget to show need.&lt;ref&gt;http://epi.publichealth.nc.gov/cd/hiv/docs/ADAPFactSheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Duke University and UNC-Memorial Hospitals have collaborated with one jail's HCV positive inmates for further follow-up testing and care.

== Policies within the United States ==

The [[World Health Organization]] released guidelines to counteract the spread of HIV in prisons during the 1980s. They stated prisons should apply policies that reduce sexual violence, enhance detection, prosecute offenders, and increase evaluation of activities done to prevent disease from spreading in prisons.&lt;ref name=Black&gt;{{cite book |last=Jürgens |first=Ralf |year=2007 |title=Interventions to Address HIV in Prisons: Prevention of Sexual Transmission |url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/hiv-aids/EVIDENCE%20FOR%20ACTION%202007%20sexual_transmission.pdf |chapter=Methodology |page=7 |publisher=World Health Organization |isbn=978-92-4-159579-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the United States there have been many important policies and programs to eliminate the spread of disease and expand the healthcare system within prisons.

There are two renowned federal cases that established prisoners' rights to healthcare and paved the way for disease prevention. In [[Estelle v. Gamble]], the court case ruled that healthcare within prisons are a constitutional right. Prior to this court case, prison systems deliberately denied prisoners much treatment, delaying access to physicians, or failing to help prisoners seek any medical judgment. This court case created measures to reduce the spread of diseases and also provided inmates with medical attention. In [[Wayne County Jail Inmates v. Lucas]], courts mandated that prisoners have the right to access drug detoxification and treatment for drug dependency. This has helped many inmates quarantine the disease by preventing the sharing of needles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kinsella |first=Chad |date=January 2004 |title=Corrections Health Care Costs |url=http://www.csg.org/knowledgecenter/docs/TA0401CorrHealth.pdf |publisher=Council of State Governments |accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major programs and policies are being initiated within each state. In New York, the Hepatitis C Continuity Program was the first of its kind to remove limits on healthcare access if a prisoner spent a limited time in jail. Prisoners now have access to HCV antiviral treatment from the moment of incarceration to even post-incarceration treatment. It was first issued measure in New York involving a coalition between different sectors to provide aid for prisoners even after release. Other guidelines included collaborating with the local healthcare systems that prisoners may potentially be released to after serving their terms.&lt;ref name=pmid17542460&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Klein SJ, Wright LN, Birkhead GS, etal |title=Promoting HCV treatment completion for prison inmates: New York State's hepatitis C continuity program |journal=Public Health Reports |volume=122 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=83–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17542460 |pmc=1831802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious public health outbreaks like the spread of [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] have prompted drastic measures leading to medical isolation. Proponents of this guideline seek to establish this measure throughout all U.S. Prisons. However, ethical issues have arisen as opponents question the segregation and labeling of individuals based on their health condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marcus |first=Martin |year=2011 |work=ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Treatment of Prisoners |title=Standard 23-2.7 Rationales for long-term segregated housing |url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/criminal_justice_section_archive/crimjust_standards_treatmentprisoners.html#23-2.7 |publisher=American Bar Association |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preventive measures ==

=== Shortcomings and limitations ===
Approaches to preventing the spread of diseases such as HIV and HCV in prisons include not only internal changes within correctional facilities, but also increased external community support. Between 2.7 million and 3.9 million Americans live with a [[Hepatitis C#Chronic infection|chronic Hepatitis C]], but less than 20% receive treatment for the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 26, 2013 |title=Viral Hepatitis Surveillance – United States, 2010 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/Statistics/2010Surveillance/ |publisher=Center for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanwal"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kanwal F, Hoang T, Spiegel BM, etal |title=Predictors of treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection - role of patient versus nonpatient factors |journal=Hepatology |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1741–9 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18046707 |doi=10.1002/hep.21927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many medically underserved patients, who are appropriate candidates for antiviral treatment, do not receive treatment for a variety of reasons, including limited or no insurance coverage and the high cost of antiviral therapy.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ward JW, Lok AS, Thomas DL, El-Serag HB, Kim WR |title=Report on a single-topic conference on 'Chronic viral hepatitis--strategies to improve effectiveness of screening and treatment' |journal=Hepatology |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=307–15 |date=January 2012 |pmid=22105599 |doi=10.1002/hep.24797}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wong JB |title=Hepatitis C: cost of illness and considerations for the economic evaluation of antiviral therapies |journal=PharmacoEconomics |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=661–72 |year=2006 |pmid=16802842 |doi=10.2165/00019053-200624070-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such access barriers are compounded by the fact that HCV is particularly prevalent in populations struggling with substance abuse problems, poverty, homelessness, mental illness, low literacy, and language issues, thereby subjecting them to mass incarceration.&lt;ref name="Kanwal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arora S, Thornton K, Jenkusky SM, Parish B, Scaletti JV |title=Project ECHO: linking university specialists with rural and prison-based clinicians to improve care for people with chronic hepatitis C in New Mexico |journal=Public Health Reports |volume=122 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=74–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17542458 |pmc=1831800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Arora S, Kalishman S, Dion D, etal |title=Partnering urban academic medical centers and rural primary care clinicians to provide complex chronic disease care |journal=Health Affairs |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=1176–84 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21596757 |pmc=3856208 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0278}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study conducted at a Florida State prison concluded that the continual persistence of HIV infections and deaths related to such infections are due to unequal distribution of health care resources to inmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Amankwaa AA, Bavon AL, Amankwaa LC |title=Gaps between HIV/AIDS policies and treatment in correctional facilities |journal=Journal of Health and Human Services Administration |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=171–98 |year=2001 |pmid=12638386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such statistics coupled with an increasing rate of incarceration only amplify the issue of HIV/HCV prevention in prisons, with the number of inmates increasing but healthcare policies remaining stagnant.

While the World Health Organization has endorsed certain preventive practices, only Vermont and Mississippi State Prisons and Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington County Jails have provided condoms to inmates.&lt;ref name="Men's Health" /&gt; Others have argued against providing condoms because officials feel it condones sexual activity, which is illegal within the prison system.&lt;ref name="Lynda"/&gt;

Imprisonment as a response to US drug use has created a ''de facto'' policy of jailing more HIV-infected individuals. High-risk behavior that persists within prisons poses harm to inmates and the greater community alike, but US courts have chosen to remain silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jordan |first=Mary M |title=Care to Prevent HIV Infection in Prison: A Moral Right Recognized by Canada, while the United States Lags Behind |journal=The University of Miami Inter-American Law Review |year=2006 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=319–37 |jstor=40176622}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separating infected individuals from the rest of the prison population has been seen as ineffective because not all infected individuals have been properly tested. That, therefore, promotes high-risk actions because there is a perceived lack of infected population.

=== Possible solutions ===

Universal screening methods have proven very effective in certain circumstances.  For example, screening among blood donors has all but eliminated transmission of HIV through blood transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dodd|first1=RY|last2=Notari|first2=EP|last3=Stramer|first3=SL|title=Current prevalence and incidence of infectious disease markers and estimated window-period risk in the American Red Cross blood donor population|journal=Transfusion|date=2002|volume=42|pages=975–9|doi=10.1046/j.1537-2995.2002.00174.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example is the reduction of perinatal transmission with the introduction of routine screening for pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;CDC. U.S. HIV and AIDS cases reported through December 1999. HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report 1999;11&lt;/ref&gt;  The benefits of introducing a routine screening program include:

* Increasing diagnosis of new cases of HIV infection;
* Preserving staff resources by streamlining the process; 
* Reducing stigma associated with testing 
* Potentially diagnosing HIV infection earlier for the inmate in the course of disease; and 
* Improving access to HIV clinical care, medication and prevention services.&lt;ref name="stacks.cdc.gov"/&gt;

In 1996, the CDC revised its recommendations to incorporate diagnostic HIV testing and opt-out HIV screening as a part of routine clinical care in all health-care settings while also preserving the patient's option to decline HIV testing. The recommendations are intended for all health-care settings including hospital emergency departments, urgent-care clinics, inpatient services, STD clinics or other venues offering clinical STD services, tuberculosis clinics, substance abuse treatment clinics, other public health clinics, community clinics, correctional health-care facilities, and primary care settings. (The guidelines address HIV testing in health-care settings only; they do not change existing guidelines concerning targeted testing of persons at high risk for HIV who seek HIV testing in nonclinical settings such as community-based organizations, outreach settings, or mobile vans.)

The new CDC guidelines state "in all health-care settings, screening for HIV infection should be performed routinely for all patients aged 13-64 years. Health-care providers should initiate screening unless prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infection in their patients has been documented to be &lt;0.1%. In the absence of existing data for HIV prevalence, health-care providers should initiate voluntary HIV screening until they establish that the diagnostic yield is &lt;1 per 1,000 patients screened, at which point such screening is no longer warranted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Branson|first1=BM|last2=Handsfield|first2=HH|last3=et|first3=al|title=Revised Recommendations for HIV Testing of Adults, Adolescents, and Pregnant Women in Health-Care Settings|journal=MMWR. Recommendations and Reports|date=September 22, 2006|volume=55|issue=RR14|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional recommendations for juveniles that are incarcerated in adult jails include the following:

* Know that incarcerated adolescents may be unaware of their rights concerning medical care, privacy, and confidentiality; therefore, it is especially important that adolescents be informed of their rights and that these rights are respected. 
* Follow state or local laws that require parental consent or notification for HIV testing and/or HIV-related health-care services for minors. If required, obtain consent for testing  and/or health-care services from the adolescent's parent or legal guardian prior to providing that service. Consent can be obtained directly from an emancipated minor as defined by state law.  
* Inform adolescents that the medical information, including HIV test results, will not be disclosed without their consent, except as required by law.  
* Inform adolescents that, as with all inmates, their HIV status will not adversely affect their medical care during incarceration or their legal rights.&lt;ref name="stacks.cdc.gov"/&gt;

Procedures for offering support to the inmate who receives a diagnosis of HIV should be in place to assure they can manage the infection.  Privacy in a correctional setting is difficult, but the inmate should be assured that his medical information is confidential. The following are CDC recommended procedures for inmate support:

* Provide education to patients about HIV infection, AIDS-related symptoms, and the significance of any laboratory testing done.  
* Inmates diagnosed with HIV infection may require short-term mental health support.  
* Inmates with mental health conditions may require increased monitoring and intervention for these conditions.  
* Inmates may be reluctant to access or possess HIV educational materials due to concerns about disclosing their HIV infection. Strategies to provide HIV education and counseling for HIV-infected inmates can include HIV educational sessions and support groups.  
* Facilities should have HIV medical information and periodicals available in prison libraries and medical clinics.  
* Facilities should have chronic disease management programs for HIV-infected inmates.  
* Facilities should have a discharge-planning program for HIV-infected inmates.&lt;ref name="stacks.cdc.gov"/&gt;

Linking inmates to HIV care services when they are quickly released back to the community from a local jail can be difficult. Often they can be more concerned with finding a place to live or finding money to pay their legal fees.  But upon giving an inmate a diagnosis of HIV, steps should be taken immediately to ensure that an appointment has been made with a provider, that contact information for a health department or community-based organization case manager is available to help them navigate the healthcare system.  Several studies indicate that follow-up care for HIV positive women may correlate with a reduction in recidivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=JY|last2=Rich|first2=J|last3=Zeirler|first3=S|last4=et all|title=Successful community follow-up and reduced recidivism of HIV-positive women prisoners|journal=Journal of Correctional Health Care|date=1997|volume=4|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vigilante|first1=KC|last2=Flynn|first2=MM|last3=Affleck|first3=PC|title=Reduction in recidivism of incarcerated women through primary care, peer counseling, and discharge planning|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=1999|volume=8|pages=409–415|doi=10.1089/jwh.1999.8.409|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flanigan|first1=TP|last2=Kim|first2=JY|last3=Zierler|first3=S|last4=Rich|first4=JD|last5=Vigilante|first5=K|last6=Bury-Maynard|first6=D|title=A prison release program for HIV-positive women: linking them to health services and community follow-up|journal=Am J Public Health|date=1996|volume=86|pages=446–453|doi=10.2105/ajph.86.6.886 |pmc=1380412}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Correctional facilities should have the following CDC recommended procedures and resources in place for inmates being discharged from custody:

* Provide a list of available agencies that provide HIV case management for released inmates.  
* Provide contact information for local AIDS service organizations and the local health department.
* Assist inmates with making appointments with case manager before release from custody. If possible, arrange for the inmate to meet the case manager before release.  
* Complete applications for other services following release in conjunction with the inmate.  
* Provide medications if the inmate has started therapy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV Testing, http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/5279&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative approaches===

The high rate of turnover in local jails as opposed to prisons may make it difficult to implement a routine testing program at intake or on a scheduled basis.  In cases where testing all incoming inmates is not possible, there are alternative approaches that can be used individually or in combination with other approaches.  One alternative approach could include risk-based criteria screening.  The CDC recommends that jails routinely offer HIV testing to inmates who fall under one or more of the following criteria: 
 
* Injection drug use (IDU); 
* Men who have sex with men (MSM);  
* Sex with an IDU, MSM, or HIV-infected partner;  
* Multiple sexual partners;  
* Exchange of sex for money, drugs, or other goods; and
* Diagnosis of another sexually transmitted disease.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The limitation with this screening approach is that risks are self-reported by the inmate.  One study suggested that up to 42% of inmates diagnosed with HIV reported no risk factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrel|first1=J|last2=Mullins|first2=J|last3=Llanas|first3=M|last4=Griffiths|first4=SD|title=Voluntary rapid human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing in jails [published online ahead of print August 23, 2007]|journal=Sex Transm Dis|date=2007|doi=10.1097/OLQ.0b013e318148b6b1|volume=36|pages=S9–S13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second alternative approach is clinical screening based on HCV, HBV or STD infection.  The presence of any of these diseases increases the likelihood of acquiring or transmitting HIV disease.  Clinical criteria for screening include:

* Pregnancy;   
* A diagnosis or history of sexually or parenterally transmitted infections (e.g., HBV or HCV, syphilis, genital herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas infection);   
* Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection or active TB;   
* Track marks indicative of illicit drug injection;   
* Signs or symptoms suggestive of HIV infection or acute retroviral syndrome.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A third alternative approach for screening in the jail setting is based on demographics such as zip code of residence, age, gender and race or ethnicity.  When using this approach, providers in correctional settings should with their state or local health department to determine the demographics of HIV for their population.  Criteria examples for demographic screening could include:

* Residence in low-income areas/zip codes;     
* Residence in known high-HIV prevalence areas/zip codes;     
* Female sex;    
* Age 25–44 years; and     
* Transgender identity (male to female).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There is also some evidence that screening based on type of arrest could indicate higher rates of HIV infection.  For example, a study by the Department of Justice found that HIV infection is more often associated with property and drug-related crimes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/ascii/hivp01.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

Because there is a high-volume turnover rate of inmates in the jail system, some inmates who are tested for HIV, HCV or other STDs may have been released before receiving their results.  Correctional facilities should assure that all cases of newly diagnosed infectious diseases are reported to the state or local health department for assistance with notification of results, counseling, partner services and linkage to care.  The CDC advocates a syndemic approach&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5j8mvSPIk8&amp;list=PL87B964CE4CF0A98C&lt;/ref&gt; to intervene in the transmission of HIV, HCV and other STDs.  This approach includes "combining services to minimize missed opportunities" to detect disease.  This approach calls for a collaborative effort between agencies to address high incarceration rates and other social justice issues such as poverty.

Possible HCV prevention techniques have included [[vaccinations]], [[methadone]] treatments for drug addicts, access to sterile syringes and needles, use of proper cleaning materials for syringes and needles, lowering the prison population, improving healthcare within prisons, increased availability of condoms, psychological therapy or counseling, or educational classes on drug use and sexual behavior for both inmates and prison staff.&lt;ref name=Weinbaum /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simooya |first=Oscar O |title=Infections in Prison in Low and Middle Income Countries: Prevalence and Prevention Strategies |journal=Open Infectious Diseases Journal |year=2010 |volume=4 |pages=33–7 |doi=10.2174/1874279301004010033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stark K, Herrmann U, Ehrhardt S, Bienzle U |title=A syringe exchange programme in prison as prevention strategy against HIV infection and hepatitis B and C in Berlin, Germany |journal=Epidemiology and Infection |volume=134 |issue=4 |pages=814–9 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16371183 |pmc=2870452 |doi=10.1017/S0950268805005613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some prisons already provide prevention techniques such as bleach tablets for cleaning, drug counselling, detoxification, and drug behavior management, but these techniques are not fully effective.

While vaccination programs are accepted, they are not widely implemented. Substance abuse programs are also rare, though HIV and HCV testing are widely available.&lt;ref name=Weinbaum /&gt; Because of the ineffectiveness of some preventive techniques, advocates push for alternative forms of rehabilitation for drug offenders to keep these potentially infected people outside of the prison system.&lt;ref name="Champion"/&gt;  These techniques do not only apply to HIV and HCV prevention, but also address the various other diseases present within correctional facilities. Since prevention of any infectious diseases presents a major unsolved problem, public healthcare professionals advocate for a more inclusive and all-encompassing approach.&lt;ref name=Weinbaum /&gt;

Due to the high rate of HIV that exists within prisons and the carceral system, these sites are crucial in educating individuals for further infection. The National Commission on Correctional Health Care conducted a study evaluating current modes of handling HIV through prevention programs across the US. In particular, one of the researchers explored peer education in the forms of curriculum modeled after the American Red Cross and California's "[[Reach One, Teach One]]" program. By discussing methods in which infected individuals can be educated, the spread of infectious diseases can be reduced by an appreciable margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lyons T, Osunkoya E, Anguh I, Adefuye A, Balogun J |title=HIV prevention and education in state prison systems: an update |journal=Journal of Correctional Health Care |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=105–15 |date=April 2014 |pmid=24532813 |doi=10.1177/1078345813518630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is near consensus in the literature about what needs to be done to reduce the incidence of sexual violence in prisons, to date, little if any research has been undertaken to assess which strategies are most effective. In addition to evaluating the various components of policies and programs to address sexual violence, prison systems have not allowed external, independent researchers to carry out, at regular intervals, a comprehensive review and analysis of the incidence of rape and other forms of sexual violence in their prisons. Additionally, victims of sexual assault in prison do not have access to [[post-exposure prophylaxis]] (PEP), which could reduce the risk for HIV transmission after exposure to HIV.&lt;ref name=Black /&gt;

== Post-treatment for HCV==

Treatment after being released from prison can be difficult because individuals must locate facilities that can provide them treatment while considering their social status, limited knowledge, and access to these resources. Hepatitis C has been one of the most widespread blood-borne infection to date within the United States of America. From 2005 to 2006, the state of New York began implementing the Hepatitis C Continuity Program, offering free HCV treatment for inmates even after release from its state prisons. The program encompassed 70 prisons and 21 health-care facilities. This program was put together by the collaborative efforts of New York State Department of Correctional Services, New York State Department of Health, New York State Division of Parole, New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and other community-based health care providers. Together, these organizations addressed the immediate need for medication upon release from prison. Inmates were given proper medication provided they possess [[Medicaid]] or any other kind of health insurance and eligibility. This program also included a facility referral system, making it easier for inmates to find the most convenient treatment location for them.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Past statistics show that the majority of inmates (60.1%) that participated in the Hepatitis C Continuity Program come from and return to New York City, 10.4% from suburban NYC counties, 16.6% from upstate counties, and the remaining 12.8% from rural counties. About 87.1% of releases have been treated for HCV by this program during their time in prison. The inmates that qualify for this program meet with staff from the Department of Correctional Services's Health Services and receive information about this opportunity. After going through paperwork regarding release of medical information to hospitals, the Department of Parole, and the Department of Health AIDS Institute, and Medicaid eligibility, the inmates are referred to facilities based on release and type of treatment required. Facilities use the inmates' HCV testing history, genotype, HCV treatment, HIV status and, if HIV infected, most recent CD4/T-Helper cell count and viral load and discharge information to determine the most suitable treatment.&lt;ref name=pmid17542460/&gt;

==CDC Definitions==

* '''Diagnostic testing''': Performing an HIV test for persons with clinical signs or symptoms consistent with HIV infection.
* '''HIV-prevention counseling''': An interactive process of assessing risk, recognizing specific behaviors that increase the risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV, and developing a plan to take specific steps to reduce risks.
* '''Informed consent''': A process of communication between patient and provider through which an informed patient can choose whether to undergo HIV testing or decline to do so. Elements of informed consent typically include providing oral or written information regarding HIV, the risks and benefits of testing, the implications of HIV test results, how test results will be communicated, and the opportunity to ask questions.
* '''Inmate''': A person incarcerated in a local jail, state prison, federal prison, or a private facility under contract to federal, state, or local authorities.
* '''Jail''': A confinement facility usually administered by a local law enforcement agency that is intended for adults, but sometimes holds juveniles, for confinement before and after adjudication. Such facilities include jails and city or county correctional centers; special jail facilities, such as medical treatment or release centers; halfway houses; work farms; and temporary holding or lockup facilities that are part of the jail's combined function. Inmates sentenced to jail facilities usually have a sentence of 1 year or less. Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont operate integrated systems, which combine prisons and jails. 
* '''Opt-out screening''': Performing HIV screening after notifying the patient that 1) the test will be performed and 2) the patient may elect to decline or defer testing. Assent is inferred unless the patient declines testing.
* '''Prison''': A long-term confinement facility, run by a state or the federal government, that typically holds felons and offenders with sentences of more than 1 year. However, sentence length may vary by state. Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont operate integrated systems, which combine prisons and jails. 
* '''Screening''': Performing an HIV test for all persons in a defined population without regard to the individual's characteristics.
* '''Targeted testing''': Performing an HIV test for subpopulations of persons at higher risk, typically defined on the basis of behavior, clinical, or demographic characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Branson, MMWR&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Justice Statistics, Revised September 30, 2014, Prisoners in 2013.

'''Karl William Kapp''' (October 27, 1910 – April 4, 1976) was a German-American [[economist]] and Professor of Economics at the City University of New York and later the University of Basel. Kapp's main contribution was the development of a theory of social costs that captures urgent socio-ecological problems and proposes preventative policies based on the precautionary principle. His theory is in the tradition of various [[Heterodox economics|heterodox economic]] paradigms &lt;ref&gt;Berger, Sebastian (2015) The Heterodox Theory of Social Costs - by K. William Kapp. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; , such as [[ecological economics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spash |first=Clive |date=1999 |title=The Development of Environmental Thinking in Economics |url=http://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1999_Spash_EV_Development.pdf |journal=Environmental Values |volume=8 |location=Cambridge |publisher=The White Horse Press |doi=10.3197/096327199129341897 |pages=413–435}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|417f}}, [[Marxian economics]], [[social economics]], and [[institutional economics]]. As such, Kapp's theory of social costs was directed against neoclassical economics and the rise of [[neoliberalism]]. &lt;ref&gt;Berger, Sebastian (2017) The Social Costs of Neoliberalism: Essays on the Economics of K. William Kapp. Nottingham: Spokesman.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an opponent of the compartmentalization of knowledge and championed, instead, the integration and humanization of the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp (1961), 'Toward a Science of Man in Society' The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Biography ==
Kapp was born in [[Königsberg]] in 1910 as son of August Wilhelm Kapp, who was a teacher of physics. In secondary school at the ''Hufengymnasium'' one of his teachers was the poet [[Ernst Wiechert]]&lt;ref name = "bio"&gt;[http://www.kwilliam-kapp.de/ Biographical Information K. William Kapp], retrieved 15 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; End 1920s he started studying [[law and economics]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|universities in Berlin]] and [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]]. He continued his studies in London and at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in Geneva, where in 1936 he received a [[Ph.D]] in economics with his dissertation „Planwirtschaft und Aussenhandel“.

In Geneva Kapp had met the people of the [[Frankfurt School]], who emigrated to the US and settled as ''Institute for Social Research'' at the Columbia University, New York City. In 1937 they granted Kapp a scholarship.&lt;ref name = "bio"/&gt; From 1938 to 1945 he was an instructor in Economics at the [[New York University]] and [[Columbia University]] in New York. From 1945 to 1950 he was Assistant Professor of Economics at the [[Wesleyan University]] in Middleton, Connecticut.

From 1950 to 1965 he was Professor of economics at the [[University of the City of New York]]. He was among the first members of the Association for Evolutionary Economics (AFEE). In 1965 he returned to Switzerland and was Professor of economics at the [[University of Basel]] until 1976. In that time he was also a Visiting Professor at the [[Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes]], Sorbonne, Paris.

In 1976 Kapp suffered a fatal heart attack during a conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.

== Work ==
Kapp's research interests ranged from economics, sociology, policy making and environmental science to the theory of knowledge, the history of economic thought, and many related topics.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kwilliam-kapp.de/pdf/Obituary%20in%20Journal%20of%20Economic%20Issues%201976.pdf Karl William Kapp 1910–1976, Obituary]" in ''Journal of Economic Issues'' (1976), nr 09.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Planning debate ===
In his 1936 dissertation ''Planwirtschaft und Aussenhandel'' contributed to the debate around the [[economic calculation problem]], a criticism of central economic planning. This problem was first proposed by [[Ludwig von Mises]] in 1920, expounded by Friedrich Hayek and further debated in the 1920s and 1930s. Kapp argued that a [[planned economy]] is "not doomed to autarky because there are ways to deal with the valuation problem so that trade and exchange with market economies can be organized".&lt;ref name = "bio"/&gt;

[[File:Letting-agent-crewe.jpg|thumb|Letting Agent Building in [[Crewe]]]]
A '''letting agent''' is a term for a [[facilitator]] through which an agreement is made between a [[landlord]] and [[leasehold estate|tenant]] for the rental of a [[residential property]]. The term is common in countries using British English, including countries of the [[Commonwealth]]. In the UK, Australia and New Zealand the agreement between landlord and tenant is normally formalised by the signing of a tenancy agreement. A letting agency will normally charge a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] for their services, usually a percentage of the annual rent.

Letting agents will often operate under the umbrella of an [[Estate Agent]] due to the synergies that exists between the two professions, but there are many agents that deal exclusively with [[letting]]s.

Although there are two main types of renting, letting agents deal primarily with tenancies between private individuals and landlords.

== Services and fees ==
There are a number of services offered by lettings agents, including:
*An Introductory Service - Finding a tenant for a landlord's property. The cost can vary depending on the agent and is usually charged up-front.
*Administration Services - This is anything that is involved in processing of the application. This can include referencing (credit searches etc.), drawing up a tenancy agreement, conducting a check-in, drawing up a schedule of condition, among other things. Fees for this service can vary widely and often non-refundable, unless the landlord withdraws from the process. Such fees have been made illegal in Scotland and tenants may reclaim any fees paid through the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/advice_topics/finding_a_place_to_live/renting_privately/letting_agencies#2 |title=Letting agencies - Shelter Scotland |publisher=Scotland.shelter.org.uk |date=2012-05-07 |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rent Collection - Many agents will offer to collect the rent from a tenant for an additional commission. This cost can vary.
*Full Management - This is the term used to describe the day-to-day management of a rental property. Many agents will provide this service for landlords who wish to have a hands off approach to their investment. This service can cost between 7% and 12.5%.

Typical letting agent fees to tenants in England and Wales may include:

*Administration fee - To cover the Administration Services mentioned above
*Inventory fee - To cover the costs of inspecting the property and drawing up an inventory
*Tenancy extension/renewal fee - A renewal fee can be charged if the tenant extends their tenancy beyond the initial term. Renewal fees can vary in cost but tend to be at lower rate than the original referencing fee
*Exit fee - Similar to the inventory fee to cover the cost of a final inspection of the property to compare its condition to that at the start of the tenancy

The chancellor, [[Philip Hammond]], promised to ban letting agent fees in England and Wales in his autumn statement of November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/22/philip-hammond-letting-fees-ban-autumn-statement-affordable-housing|title=Chancellor to crack down on letting fees in autumn statement|first1=Anushka|last1=Asthana|first2=Rowena|last2=Mason|first3=Heather|last3=Stewart|date=22 November 2016|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To maximise the service that a letting agent provides it is important prospective tenants to make letting agents aware of their requirements before they arrange viewings so that properties are better matched to tenant's needs. Since letting agents act as a matchmaker between property, landlord and tenant it is important for them to gain an understanding of customer requirements including; location, property size, budget, pets, etc.

== Regulation ==
There are currently no statutory arrangements regarding the regulation of letting agents. Around half of UK lettings agents are currently self-regulated. The principal organisations for lettings agents are the [[Association of Residential Letting Agents]] (ARLA) and the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] (RICS). These have codes of practice and compliance controls which govern the activities of their members.

The English government also provides its own accrediting body for letting agents. This body is called NALS (National Assured Letting Scheme). See http://www.nalscheme.co.uk/whatis.htm

In Scotland all landlords must be registered with the local authority. Whilst agents are not required to register, they are actively encouraged to do so.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6813">'''Menstrual leave''' is a type of [[Leave of absence|leave]] where a [[woman]] may have the option to take paid or unpaid leave from her employment if she is [[menstruating]] and is unable to go to work because of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://classprojects.kenyon.edu/wmns/Wmns36/bloodflow/legal.htm#leave|title=menstrual leave|author=classprojects}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cleanclothes.org/newslist/252-labour-rights-in-indonesia-what-is-menstruation-leave |title= what is menstruation leave |author= cleanclothes |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110813171350/http://cleanclothes.org/newslist/252-labour-rights-in-indonesia-what-is-menstruation-leave |archivedate= 2011-08-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Menstrual leave is controversial because it is seen by some as a criticism of women's work efficiency or as [[sexism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iuliano|first=Sarah|title=Menstrual leave: delightful or discriminatory?|url=http://lipmag.com/culture/menstrual-leave-delightful-or-discriminatory/|work=5 August 2013|publisher=Lip Magazine|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Price|first=Catherine|title=Should women get paid menstruation leave?|url=http://www.salon.com/2006/10/11/menstruation_4/|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=Salon|date=11 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A girls' school in the south [[India]]n state of [[Kerala]] had granted its students menstrual leave as early as 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/kerala-news/a-kerala-school-granted-period-leave-105-years-ago-1739698 "A Kerala School Granted Period Leave 105 Years Ago"]. [[NDTV]]. 20 August 2017. Retrieved 20 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of menstrual leave started in [[Japan]] in the early 20th century. In the 1920s, Japanese labor unions started to demand leave (seiri kyuka) for their female workers. In 1947, a [[law]] was brought into force by the Japanese Labor Standards that allowed menstruating women to take days off work. Then a unique legislation of its kind, it is now found in a few countries. [[Debate]] continues as to whether it is a [[medical necessity]] or a discriminatory measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor= 3174950|title= Japan's 1986 Equal Employment Opportunity Law and the Changing Discourse on Gender|author=JSTOR | volume=20|pages=268–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://gradworks.umi.com/32/65/3265147.html|title= Periodic struggles: Menstruation leave in modern Japan|author= HARVARD UNIVERSITY, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/24/women-menstrual-leave-menopause-equality-biology-not-destiny&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/should-women-get-paid-menstrual-leave-days/370789/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate policies==

[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] also included menstrual leave in their [[Code of Conduct]] in 2007, implemented around the globe wherever they operate. Nike obliges the [[business partners]] to follow the code principles by signing a [[Memorandum of Understanding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.apparelsearch.com/education/research/child_labor_clothing/child_labor_fashion_industry_2005/V_Apparel_Appendices/Surveys_from_companies/Nike.htm|title= NIKE Policy|author= apparelsearch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU) started a campaign for menstrual leave for female employees at [[Toyota]]. The union asked for 12 paid days of menstrual leave for a woman per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200502/s1300583.htm|title= Unions seek 'menstrual leave' for Toyota workers |author= abc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==
Menstrual leave policies exist in some Asian countries, although individual companies in countries that do not have national laws may choose to implement such policies.

In [[Indonesia]], under the Labor Act of 1948, women have a right to two days of menstrual leave per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niew.gov.my/niew/en/download/doc_download/324-labour-act|title=Labour Act|author=Govt. of Indonesia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004064721/http://www.niew.gov.my/niew/en/download/doc_download/324-labour-act|archivedate=2011-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]],  Article 68 of the Labour Standards Law states "When a woman for whom work during menstrual periods would be specially difficult has requested leave, the employer shall not employ such woman on days of the menstrual period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ilo.org/public/english/dialogue/ifpdial/info/national/jp.htm|title= National Labour Law Profile: Japan |author=International Labour Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianfoodworker.net/maternity/UIZensen-model-CBA.pdf |title= Comparison of the Japanese Laws and Model CBA of UI ZENSEN on Maternity Protection |author= asianfoodworker}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Japanese law requires that a woman going through especially difficult menstruation be allowed to take leave, it does not require companies to provide paid leave or extra pay for women who choose to work during menstruation.

In [[South Korea]], not only are female employees entitled to menstrual leave according to the Article 71 of the Labour Standards Law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ilo.org/public/english/dialogue/ifpdial/info/national/kor.htm |title= National Labour Law Profile: Japan|author= International Labour Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are also ensured additional pay if they do not take the menstrual leave that they are entitled to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2885715 |title= Once again, court orders menstrual leave payout |author= joongangdaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Taiwan]], the Act of Gender Equality in Employment gives women three days of "menstrual leave" per month, which will not be calculated toward the 30 days of "common sick leave", giving women up to 33 days of "health-related leaves" per year. The extra three days do not come with half-pays once a woman employee exceeds the regulated 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2013/11/27/394603/Gender-equality.htm|title=Gender equality in employment act revised|author=The China Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Defense of [[Argentina]]''' is a [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] of the [[Government of Argentina#Executive Branch|national executive power]] that deals with everything related to the country's national defense. It currently works at the [[Libertador Building]], at Paseo Colón 250, [[Buenos Aires]].

As of July 2017 the minister of Defense is [[Oscar Aguad]].

==History==
Traditionally the minister of Defense, as the Joint chiefs of Staff (Spanish: ''Estado Mayor Conjunto'') which traces back its origin to 1948 had a minor role in all armed forces activities, relegating key decisions to the respectives chiefs of staff. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuerzas-armadas.mil.ar/historia/resena.asp RESEÑA HISTÓRICA DEL ESTADO MAYOR CONJUNTO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126162932/http://www.fuerzas-armadas.mil.ar/historia/resena.asp |date=2010-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major change came into effect on 12 June 2006 when President [[Néstor Kirchner]] brought into effect the Defense Law, which had been passed in 1988 as a means to modernize the doctrine of the armed forces and define their role, although successive governments had failed to put it into effect. 

The law states that the armed forces will only be used against foreign aggression, and reduces the powers of the heads of the armed services, centralizing whole operational and acquisitions decisions under the authority of the minister of Defense through the Armed Forces Joint General Staff emphasizing [[Jointness]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=822369|title=Reglamentación de la ley de defensa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Democrats Party''' (NDP) was a small right-wing political party in New Zealand, formed in 1999 by Anton Foljambe.

The party described itself as "New Zealand's only conservative political party". It was generally regarded as crypto-fascist, but not racist. Foljambe ran as an election candidate two or three times, with poor results. [[Kyle Chapman]] became Deputy Chairman of the NDP, and ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Christchurch in 2007, pulling approximately 1% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10469779 |title=The wackiest candidates win our votes |work=nzherald.co.nz |year=2011 |quote=Making waves - or possibly up for a salute or three - on the Mainland was Kyle Chapman, former National Front leader standing under the National Democrats banner for Christchurch mayor.  |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's policies included strident [[anti-communism]] and anti-feminism, the restoration of capital punishment and corporal punishment and strong national defence. It advocated a "corporatist" constitution, and had a conspiratorial view of world events.

Foljambe resigned from the party in 2007. The party now appears to be defunct. Its website is no longer operational.

{{about|the Australian paramilitary offshoot|the novel by Robert Muchamore|New Guard (novel)}}
The '''New Guard''' was a paramilitary organisation formed in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in February 1931 by [[Australian Army officer rank insignia|lieutenant colonel]] [[Eric Campbell (political activist)|Eric Campbell]], as a more visibly militant offshoot of another paramilitary organisation, the [[Old Guard (Australia)|Old Guard]]. Like its predecessor, its central tenets originated from a conservative tradition defending loyalty to King and Empire, sound government, law and order, individual liberty and property rights. In particular, the movement was formed in response to the policies adopted by [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], the leader of the [[Australian Labor Party (NSW)|Labor Party]] and [[Premier of New South Wales]] It was led by Lieute. Colonel [[Eric Campbell (Australian political activist)|Eric Campbell]], a [[World War I|First World War]] veteran. The New Guard declined rapidly following [[Lang Dismissal Crisis|Lang's dismissal]] in May 1932, with its remaining members becoming increasingly inclined towards [[fascism]]. Still led by Campbell, the movement unsuccessfully attempted to enter [[Parliament of New South Wales|parliament]] at the [[New South Wales state election, 1935|1935 state election]] (running as the [[Centre Party (New South Wales)|Centre Party]]), but disbanded completely shortly after.

==Historical context==
Politically, the end of the [[World War I|Great War]] in 1918 left Australians  unusually discontented and polarised.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;
{{Citation | author1=Hogan, Michael (Michael Charles) | title=The sectarian strand : religion in Australian history | publication-date=1987 | publisher=Penguin Books | isbn=978-0-14-009295-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Venomous campaigns for the 1916-1917 conscription plebiscites had contributed a heavy dose of sectarianism and of rhetoric about disloyalty and extremism. The [[Australian General Strike of 1917|1917 Australian General Strike]] had also left a bitter legacy. The [[Labour movement|union movement]] resented the vindictive suppression of the strike; conservatives saw the strike as proof of union extremism sparked by foreign theorists. Similarly, [[Bolshevik]] success in the 1917 [[October Revolution]] in Russia increased the credibility of a revolutionary strategy in the eyes both of those who feared it and of those who favoured it.

The labour movement reflected this sour mood.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;
{{Citation | author1=Freudenberg, Graham (Norman Graham) | author2=Australian Labor Party. New South Wales Branch | author3=Freudenberg, Graham (Norman Graham), 1934- | title=Cause for power : the official history of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labor Party | publication-date=1991 | publisher=Pluto Press in association with the NSW ALP | isbn=978-0-949138-60-6 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Its parliamentary strategy had been partly discredited by the desertion of leaders in the conscription split. After the war, impatient unions signalled their interest in methods proposed by the [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] [[One Big Union (concept)|"One Big Union"]] movement. Thwarted at the [[Australian Labor Party]]'s 1919 Annual Conference, supporters of this approach failed in their attempt to set up a breakaway party; but [[Jock Garden]] (Secretary of the [[Labor Council of New South Wales|NSW Labor Council]]) did manage a merger of socialist groups to form the [[Communist Party of Australia]] in August 1920. For a time the Labor Party managed to contain its hard-core socialists. In October 1921 its Federal Conference did adopt a socialist objective. This was carefully qualified, becoming a timeless target to be pursued by constitutional and parliamentary methods. But unsurprisingly, the ideological conflict alarmed conservatives. So too did NSW Labor's uncomfortable relationship with the Communists. In 1925 the Labor Party Annual Conference even resolved to allow the Communist Party to affiliate with Labor. Although the Party quickly reversed this decision, Communist penetration would remain a credible threat to the labour movement and a basis for "Red bogey" rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nairn|first=Bede|title=The Big Fella|year=1986|publisher=MUP|isbn=0522843298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jack Lang and the Depression==
[[File:JackLang.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]] was [[Premier of New South Wales]] on two separate occasions, from 1925 to 1927 and again from 1930 to his dismissal in 1932.]]
Jack Lang's reputation for radicalism arose during his 1925-27 term as Premier. Graham Freudenberg aptly terms his programme “solid Labor reforms clothed in provocative language”.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;{{rp|139–142}}&lt;ref name=ref4plus&gt;{{Citation | author1=Clune, David | author2=[[Kenneth Turner|Turner, Ken]] | author3=Sesquicentenary of Responsible Government in New South Wales 1856-2006. Committee | title=The premiers of New South Wales, 1856-2005. Volume 2 | publication-date=2006 | publisher=Federation Press | isbn=978-1-86287-551-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jack Lang|year=1977|publisher=Hale and Iremonger|location=Sydney|isbn=978-0-908094-09-7|author=Nelson, H|editor=Radi, Heather}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intimidating most of his parliamentary colleagues, Lang built a fervent following in the unions and branches as the leader, at last, who could be trusted to implement Labor policies.

The “Big Fella” was a remorseless faction fighter and a formidable demagogue. He was no revolutionary nor anyone's puppet. When necessary, he could use support from “Trades Hall Reds”, but still opposed Communist infiltration of the Labor Party. To achieve the Labor reforms he sincerely wanted, he focussed upon shoring up his personal control, carefully polishing his image as the champion of the unions, the branches, the little people.
On the other hand, his aggressive style and rhetoric provided an easy target for cartoonists and press sensationalism. His rough handling of symbolic issues like the role of the upper house, the rights of overseas bondholders or the role of the King's representatives at important ceremonial occasions reinforced conservatives’ image of Lang as a “Red wrecker”.

After a landslide win in October 1930, Lang faced eighteen months of overlapping crises associated with the Great Depression.&lt;ref name=ref5&gt;{{Citation | author1=Schedvin, C. B. (Carl Boris) | title=Australia and the great depression : a study of economic development in the 1920s and 1930s | publication-date=1970 | publisher=Sydney University Press | isbn=978-0-424-06660-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An open economy, dependent on overseas markets and investment, Australia was hit hard by a collapse of world prices for its exports. Large overseas debt repayments could only be met if Australian governments heavily cut other expenditures.

Lang's mission was to fight orthodox economic policies eroding the people's hard-won living standards through cuts in pensions and wages, together with reduced spending on public works which could have countered already severe unemployment levels. His relentless push for the abolition or at least taming of the [[Legislative Council]] reassured Labor supporters but deeply alarmed its opponents, especially when the Council, after new appointments, on May 13, 1932 passed the contentious Mortgages Taxation Bill.

More damaging was his feud with the Commonwealth Government over Depression policy and control of NSW Labor. Eventually a Lang Labor breakaway group helped bring down the Scullin Government and Labor's Federal Conference expelled Lang Labor. Both competed at the December 1931 election, won by the new [[United Australia Party]]. This heralded a decade in the wilderness for Labor at both levels.
To the horror of conservatives, the same period saw a socialist resurgence. At the 1930 Annual Conference Lang's “Inner Group” did not openly oppose a proposal to educate members and workers to prepare the way for “socialism in our time”. The energy of the subsequent campaign produced a rapid expansion of “socialisation units” whose leadership became a rival for control of Labor's machine. The 1931 Annual Conference actually passed a Three Year Plan for “socialism in our time”. It was rescinded on the following day after intense lobbying and ideological counter-attack by the “Inner Group”. Tension remained until the socialisation unit organisation was disbanded in 1933.&lt;ref name=ref6&gt;{{Citation | author1=Cooksey, Robert J. (Robert John) | title=Lang and socialism : a study in the great depression | publication-date=1971 | publisher=Australian National University Press | isbn=978-0-7081-0124-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930 election campaign Lang denied any intention of repudiating overseas debt. Nevertheless, in February 1931 the Lang Plan proposed that Australian governments should pay no further interest to British bondholders until Britain dealt with Australia's debts as it had settled its own with America. For conservatives this was an issue with strong overtones of unsound finance and disloyalty to Britain. A young [[Robert Menzies|R.G. Menzies]] conceded that the depression burden might need to be more fairly shared, but in May 1931 warned against violating the rights of bondholders: “If Australia was to surmount her trouble only by abandonment of traditional British standards of honesty, justice, fair play and honest endeavour, it would be better for Australia that every citizen within her boundaries should die of starvation during the next six months”.&lt;ref name=ref7&gt;{{Citation | author1=Hazlehurst, Cameron | author2=Hazlehurst, Cameron, 1941- | title=Menzies observed | publication-date=1979 | publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin Australia | isbn=978-0-86861-320-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}} Lang played effectively upon the prejudices of his day, demonising landlords, moneylenders, and Jewish international financiers. His perfect target was the deflationary advice of Sir [[Otto Niemeyer]], a Bank of England representative invited to report upon Australian prospects when the Scullin Government asked that Bank to fund Australia's London debts. Unable to get a moratorium or to have the Commonwealth take over a substantial part of NSW debt, Lang announced in February 1932 that NSW would default on April overseas loan payments. After meeting the bill, the new UAP Government sought repayment. Lang defiantly withdrew over £1m of NSW revenue from banks to be held by the NSW Treasury and ordered NSW departments to deposit revenues there in cash. When the Commonwealth on May 6 required NSW officials to pay revenues into the Commonwealth Bank, Lang instructed NSW departments not to do so. This arguably illegal behaviour became the immediate cause of Governor Game's decision to dismiss the Lang Government, although it was not tested in the courts.&lt;ref name=ref8&gt;{{Citation | author1=Clune, David, 1951- | author2=Turner, Ken, 1928- | title=The governors of New South Wales 1788-2010 | publication-date=2009 | publisher=The Federation Press | isbn=978-1-86287-743-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Guard and Old Guard==

One difficulty in assessing the New Guard's impact is that other separate but similar groups were also active, so that it was not always easy to assign responsibility for particular activities.&lt;ref name=ref9&gt;{{Citation | author1=Moore, Andrew (Andrew John), 1953- | title=The secret army and the Premier : conservative paramilitary organisations in New South Wales 1930-32 | publication-date=1989 | publisher=New South Wales University Press | isbn=978-0-86840-283-3 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/19290792}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the countryside many groups protesting against perceived neglect, like the Riverina Movement, saw possible escape from Sydney domination and an opportunity to dissociate themselves from the “New South Welshers”. Behind the scenes a well connected Old Guard exercised considerable influence within such groups, through a network of relationships with traditional country institutions. By contrast, the New Guard was largely a Sydney organisation with only about 3000 country members. Yet it was the very public face of paramilitary activity. Often its name served as an umbrella term for all such activities. So the extent of Old Guard influence was usually not fully recognised, while that of the New Guard overstated.

What was “New”?&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;{{rp|158–163}} The New Guard began as a breakaway from the Old Guard after Campbell had been invited to resign, following his open criticism of the "cowardly secrecy and timid inaction" of Old Guard leaders. Nevertheless, the two groups remained very similar in their values and purposes, their distaste for selfish machine politics, their extremist/socialist targets, and even to some extent in their methods. Indeed, in its first few months the New Guard tried hard to negotiate acceptable terms for amalgamation. Some support for reunion continued even after this approach ended in April 1931.

Yet there were significant differences in their tactical emphases. These reflected differences in the nature of their leadership and the political resources available to them. The Old Guard's basic strength was that its leaders were part of Sydney's social and economic elite, including eminent AIF leaders, churchmen, businessmen. For example, one was a director of the [[Bank of New South Wales]], which provided its bank draft. Another with links to the Defence Department, as secretary of the Royal Agricultural Society could accommodate horses and troops if country light horsemen needed to be sent to Sydney. As president of the [[Royal Sydney Golf Club]], another could provide a convenient site for armed militia to drill. As influential insiders, the Old Guard leaders preferred to wait until threats to social order crystallised. If the civil authorities seemed unable to cope, they were to act as auxiliary guardians in support. Their role was to be a disciplined force prepared to intervene effectively to avert social breakdown, as their predecessors had earlier acted against union militants and socialists to ensure the maintenance of essential services.

Old Guard practice was not quite this restrained. For example, in November 1931 at Grenfell they disrupted an open-air meeting addressed by Jock Garden. On the following day plans for similar action in Cowra were dropped when a large Australian Labor Army force turned up to defend Garden. In many country towns vigilance committees were encouraged to drive out the local subversives.&lt;ref&gt;John James (1961), "The Guardsmen are born", Nation, lxiv, 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt; An impressive mobilisation occurred in Dubbo to deal with its hundred or so “human dingoes”. Despite the anti-climax, which resulted in one person being kicked out, this exercise was favourably received; one newspaper described the incident as staunch bushmen “exterminating Red pests”.&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;{{rp|127–132}}
[[Image:De Groot cutting the ribbon.jpg|thumb|300px|Captain de Groot declares the Sydney Harbour Bridge open.]]
Nevertheless, the New Guard had a stronger taste for vigilante action. It would not merely wait in reserve nor escape responsibility for its actions by hiding behind allegedly spontaneous vigilance committees. One of its divisional commanders foreshadowed its direct action methods against “Communist and other reptile meetings”. “Particularly obnoxious vermin” were to be dealt with by select tarring and feathering and horse whipping. He reported that the boys treated the idea “with much joy and flexing of muscles”.&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;{{rp|146}}

The regular disruption of opponents’ meetings was partly a consequence of the New Guard's more limited political resources. Its finances were always under strain and it lacked the support network associated with the Old Guard. It was a “second-string” force with few socially significant leaders. Lacking the easy legitimacy of high social status and insider influence, it became increasingly wild in the early months of 1932.

Arguing that the time for talk was over, Campbell stepped up the programme of disruption and issued directives on the techniques of street fighting. At a more theatrical level, [[Francis de Groot]]'s cutting of the ribbon at the opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] on March 19, 1932 saved face for Campbell who had promised that Lang could not be permitted to usurp that ceremonial duty.&lt;ref name=ref13&gt;{{Citation | author1=Moore, Andrew | title=Francis de Groot : Irish fascist, Australian legend | publication-date=2005 | publisher=Federation Press | isbn=978-1-86287-573-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; De Groot, an Irish-born veteran of the First World War and furniture maker, infiltrated a mounted parade at the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge#Opening|official opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. Wearing his old [[15th Hussars]] uniform, he slashed the opening ribbon with a cavalry sword before Lang could perform the ceremony. He declared the bridge open "in the name of the loyal and decent people of New South Wales". Arrested by police, he was taken to a mental hospital for examination. The ribbon was hastily retied and duly cut by the premier.
 
By May 1932 it seemed that at least some New Guard members were ready for a coup d’état, as rumours spread of plots to kidnap Lang and to imprison State Cabinet at [[Berrima, New South Wales|Berrima]]. The police presented evidence on this to the trial of the Guardsmen who had attacked Jock Garden, that the New Guard leadership had intended to hijack the Labor cabinet, incarcerate them in the Berrima Goal (disused at the time), and take over the State government.&lt;ref&gt; John James (1965), review of Eric Campbell, "The Rallying Point", Nation, xlxxix 1965, 20-23.&lt;/ref&gt;The Old Guard worried that it might have to protect the social order from the New Guard as well as the socialists.&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;{{rp|163}}

==New Guard capability==

[[File:Colonel Eric Campbell, 1931.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Lieutenant-Colonel [[Eric Campbell (Australian political activist)|Eric Campbell]] was the founder and most prominent leader of the New Guard, and later contested the [[New South Wales state election, 1935|1935 state election]] under the banner of the [[Centre Party (New South Wales)|Centre Party]], which he had also formed.]]

Although ''Labor Daily'' enjoyed taunting the “Boo Guard”, Lang Labor did defend itself by forming its Australian Labor Army and also by providing for the recruitment of special constables. Yet there is room to doubt whether the New Guard was capable of mounting a successful coup. For propaganda reasons, New Guard membership was often exaggerated, as when Campbell foreshadowed a procession of 100,000 men along Macquarie Street to present a petition to the Governor. Police estimates were perhaps 38,000 in Sydney and 3000 in the countryside, not all active or solidly supportive. Meetings were penetrated by spies and informants, while the New Guard's own intelligence operations were unimpressive. For example, its directors unrealistically asserted that there were 252,473 Communists in ten Sydney electorates alone.&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;{{rp|147}}

Its administration was unwieldy, with frequent squabbles within its overcomplicated command structures. Campbell was unconvincing in the role of charismatic great leader and was often criticised within his movement for his rash and abrasive leadership style. Often New Guard operations were surprisingly amateurish. For example, a June 1932 “Operation Bushfires” seemed a good public relations opportunity in the countryside. Despite a considerable effort, transport and equipment bungles and inexpert personnel only irritated locals. On another occasion New Guard members from adjoining areas brawled, each believing the other to be an Australian Labor Army group.

In addition, the New Guard operated under considerable constraints besides labour movement counter-measures. Even the Old Guard resisted its attempts to expand and eventually came to see it as a threat to social order which might have to be taken on. Commonwealth authorities were hostile to its sabre rattling. In the face of a coordinated police campaign, the New Guard even showed some signs of wilting.&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;{{rp|148–154,169–173}}

== Fascist tendencies ==

Initially the New Guard had a highly individualist Ideology; one of its primary aims was 'Maintenance of the full liberty of the subject':  'The foundation of the British Constitution is the supremacy of the individual over the State; the right to enjoy the fruits of our labor; freedom of expression and freedom of conscience. The great struggle ahead of us is to retain these liberties so as to give our children a heritage of freedom, and not slavery'.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Walsh, ‘Communism or Freedom: Which Is It to Be? (Part Two)’,The New Guard, 1:5 (February 1932),pp. 2 – 3&lt;/ref&gt;
Between the wars, [[fascism]] appealed to many who felt liberal democratic institutions were failing to cope. Its alternative was centralisation of authority in the hands of a charismatic leader seeking a regeneration of society, generally upon a basis of unquestioning nationalism tinged with militarism. This overriding cause justified violent suppression of opposition from selfish sectional interests and included fierce anti-communism.The New Guard did display many of these features. In particular, Campbell's interest in an 'individualist form' of fascism strengthened in the early 1930s. At first he was coy about what might replace the old machine politics. Perhaps a small commission of 'disinterested gentlemen' with irreproachable records might provide an interim administration for about three years, or longer if wanted? In 1932 he asserted: 'The New Guard is the vanguard of a crusade for moral regeneration.... We will bridge all classes to work for a common goal...and prove that the British race does not deteriorate under Southern skies...Inspired by the example of Italy, the New Guard will create in Australia a new spirit in the people'.&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;{{rp|137,161}} On his return from a 1933 European tour, he wrote ''The New Road''  which favoured Italian corporatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Eric|title=The New Road|year=1934|publisher=Briton Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also adopted the symbolism of bodyguards, escorts, uniforms, and the Roman salute. The New Guard's ideology was a mixture of classical liberal individualism and economic corporatism.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ‘Campbell’s Slashing Broadcasts’, op. cit., p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New Guard member.jpeg|thumb|Costume of an inner Fascist group member. National Archives of Australia]]
Also within the New Guard were splinter groups like the Fascist Legion whose militancy worried even Campbell. Legion members wore Ku Klux Klan style gowns and hoods at meetings to guarantee anonymity. Besides investigating disloyalty and laxity within the New Guard, they engaged in actions like a home invasion to bash militant unionist [[Jock Garden]]. They were reported to be planning kidnaps and raids upon police arms stores. Such activities contributed to a “stampede” of resignations which began even before Lang's dismissal.&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;

Was NSW close to civil war by May 1932? Certainly political life was fearful, angry, close to violence. Many victims of the Great Depression looked desperately for better answers. While advocates of system change included revolutionary socialists, there seems little basis for the contemporary hysteria about insurrection from that source.  It was rather the self-styled guardians who seemed poised for a coup. Andrew Moore suggests that Campbell (and even more the Fascist Legion) were ready for an effort to fulfil their fascist potential. But he also argues that the New Guard lacked the capability to succeed in that attempt.&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;

==Decline==
{{See also|Centre Party (New South Wales)}}
By mid 1932 the New Guard was largely a spent force, though it drifted into the mid 1930s. It contested the state 1935 election (under the name of the [[Centre Party (New South Wales)|Centre Party]]) and even enjoyed an after life as a bogey in the early 1970s. The rapid fall away of New Guard membership with Lang's dismissal does seem indirect evidence of a lack of support for a fascist agenda. Yet there is no way of knowing what events might have been sparked if a coup had been attempted in so tense a context. However, it was not. Characteristically, the Old Guard waited, preferring first a heavy-handed attempt to influence Governor Game to dismiss the Lang Government. Eventually, after cautious and open consideration, Game's timely intervention did release the tension. Although his polarising style had been a major cause of the crisis, Lang also contributed to the resolution. He apparently considered pre-emptive action to prevent his dismissal, but refrained.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt;  Nor did he have any desire for armed struggle in the streets. Instead he fought on through traditional parliamentary methods. Perhaps he believed he would at least keep control within NSW Labor, to return triumphant as he had after defeat in 1927.

On May 13 the UAP leader, Bertram Stevens, was sworn in as a caretaker Premier. A general election was held on June 11 which overwhelmingly rejected Lang's bid to regain office. Tension between Commonwealth and NSW law enforcement authorities, which had seemed on the verge of confrontation, cooled down. The story of the rise and decline of the New Guard suggests that, for the citizens of NSW, the habits of living with liberal democratic institutions remained entrenched.&lt;ref name=dave&gt;{{Citation | author1=Clune, David | author2=Griffith, Gareth, 1953- | title=Decision and deliberation : the parliament of New South Wales 1856-2003 | publication-date=2005 | publisher=Federation Press | isbn=978-1-86287-591-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|238}}

The '''New People's Army''' ('''NPA''') ({{lang-fil|Bagong Hukbong Bayan}}) is the armed wing of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP). It was formed and founded by [[Jose Maria Sison]] (Commander Dante) and Lucio Manlapaz on 29 March 1969. The [[Maoist]] NPA conducts its armed [[guerrilla]] struggle based on the strategical line of [[protracted people's war]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The [[Philippine Army]] estimated the NPA's strength at 3,200 fighters at the end of 2015.&lt;ref name=StarMar2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romero|first1=Alexi|title=AFP to NPA: No choice but to talk peace|url=https://ph.news.yahoo.com/afp-npa-no-choice-talk-000000779.html|accessdate=30 March 2015|agency=Philippine Star|date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1992, the Philippine government has treated the NPA along with the CPP as an illegal organization. The Anti-Subversion Act of 1957 which outlawed the group was lifted during the administration of [[Fidel Ramos]]. The NPA continued to operate. It was in 2011 that peace talks resumed.

The NPA collects [[revolutionary tax|exhorts money, mostly from businesses, in the areas where it operates]], in the areas where it operates.&lt;ref name=GMAMar14&gt;{{cite news|last=FERNANDEZ|first=AMANDA|title=NPA guerrillas mainly concentrated in north-eastern, southern Mindanao — AFP|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/354670/news/nation/npa-guerrillas-mainly-concentrated-in-north-eastern-southern-mindanao-afp|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=GMA News|date=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPP refers to the NPA as "the tax enforcement agency of the people's revolutionary government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.josemariasison.org/?p=9281|title=About The New People's Army And  Thpal-Sumitomo|publisher=JoseMariasison.org|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Lieutenant Colonel Ramon Zagala, speaking for the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], said that "[the communist rebels] have lost their ideological mooring and now engaged in extortion [activities]".&lt;ref name=GMAMar14/&gt;

Peace negotiations have reached an impasse. The Philippine government has specifically drafted a "new framework" which seeks to end the 27-year-long stalemate in the talks, hoping to build ground with the leftist rebels that is more comprehensive than human rights, the only issue on which the negotiating parties agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/05/06/939112/govt-drafts-new-framework-guide-peace-talks-leftist-rebels|title=Gov't drafts new framework to guide peace talks with leftist rebels|work=PhilStar.com|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, relations with the government soured in 2017. President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] officially designated the group as a terrorist organization in late 2017.

Both the United States and the European Union had designated the NPA as a terrorist organization prior to the Duterte government.

== History ==
{{main article|CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion}}
{{main|First Great Rectification Movement}}
The 1960s saw a revival in nationalism and patriotism especially among the youth and students in the Philippines. The ongoing [[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] in China sparked a renewed interest in [[Marxism–Leninism–Maoism]] study, with emphasis on lessons from the [[Chinese Revolution (1946−1952)|Chinese Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} [[National democratic]] organizations such as the [[Kabataang Makabayan]] and other groups began to see the need for a renewed armed struggle based upon Mao's strategy of [[protracted people's war]]. On 26 December 1968, the CPP was re-established on a Marxist−Leninist−Mao Zedong thought line. The CPP immediately went about organizing a new people's army. The CPP had previously made contact with former members of the [[Hukbalahap|Hukbong Mapagpalayang Bayan]] (HMB), to which the Huks changed their name in the 1950s, in Central Luzon. On 29 March 1969, the New People's Army was formed. It had only 72 fighters and was equipped with light weapons. After its initial formation, the CPP and the NPA dispersed and established regional cells in several parts of the country.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The NPA claims responsibility for the 1989 assassination of [[U.S. Army]] [[Colonel]] [[James N. Rowe|James "Nick" Rowe]], founder of the U.S. Army [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]] (SERE) course. Colonel Rowe was part of a military assistance program to the Philippine Army. The NPA asserts that this made him a legitimate military target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usvetdsp.com/story16.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328043831/http://www.usvetdsp.com/story16.htm|title=U.S. Gives Philippines Lukewarm Reminder to Keep Col.

=== Second Great Rectification Movement ===
{{main|Second Great Rectification Movement}}
In the 1990s internal criticism about mistakes in the 1980s led to the Second Great Rectification Movement, launched in 1992 and largely completed in 1998, leading to a resurgence in the Philippine insurgency. The Second Rectification ended internal purges of the movement that killed hundreds of members on allegations of being "deep penetration agents" of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (AFP) and the [[National Intelligence Coordinating Agency|Philippine intelligence community]]. Former CPP and NPA cadre Lualhati Milan Abreu's award-winning memoir ''Agaw-Dilim Agaw Liwanag'' chronicled the executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abreu|first=Lualhati Milan|title=Agaw Dilim Agaw Liwanag|year=2009|publisher=University of the Philippines Press|location=Quezon City, Philippines|isbn=978-971-542-617-6|page=271|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lBMpoChpa4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=agaw+dilim+agaw+liwanag&amp;hl=tl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-iZ-T_njOaudmQWB-ZTzDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its successes, the Second Great Rectification also resulted in a series of splits within the CPP and the NPA. The [[Alex Boncayao Brigade]], notorious for targeting policemen and officials that were allegedly corrupt, left the party, while some ended up forming groups such as the Revolutionary Proletarian Army and the Rebolusyonaryong Hukbong Bayan.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

This group was designated as a foreign [[terrorist]] organization by the [[United States]] in August 2002 and by the [[European Union]] in November 2005.&lt;ref name="eucouncil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usdos"&gt;{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Powell|title=Designation of a Foreign Terrorist Organization|publisher=[[U.S. State Department]]|date=9 August 2002|url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/2002/12542.htm|accessdate=17 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314180724/http://www.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/2002/12542.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=14 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NPA's founder lives in the [[Philippines]] in peace, but under close watch by the government.

The [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Arroyo]] administration negotiated intermittently with delegates of the NPA in European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New People's Army – Mapping Militant Organizations|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/149|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrest of a [[Naxalite|Naxalite guerrilla]] by Indian security forces suggested links with the NPA, who were said to have traveled to India to teach them how to conduct guerrilla warfare against the army and police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/LD22Ae01.html|title=Asia Times Online :: Southeast Asia news and business from Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, AFP chief Hermogenes Esperon Jr. claimed that the NPA rebels had only around 4,900 members, significantly down from 26,000 at its peak in the 1980s.

On 5 September 2007, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed Amnesty Proclamation 1377 for members of the CPP and its armed wing, the NPA; other communist rebel groups; and their umbrella organization, the [[National Democratic Front (Philippines)|National Democratic Front]]. The [[amnesty]] covers the crime of rebellion and all other crimes "in pursuit of political beliefs", but not crimes against chastity, rape, torture, kidnapping for ransom, use and trafficking of [[illegal drugs]] and other crimes for personal ends and violations of international law or convention and protocols, "even if alleged to have been committed in pursuit of political beliefs". The National Committee on Social Integration (NCSI) was to issue a Certificate of Amnesty to qualified applicants. Implementing rules and regulations were drafted and the decree was submitted to the [[Senate of the Philippines]] and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]] for their concurrence. The proclamation was to become effective only after Congress had concurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/407731/senate-urged-concur-amnesty-proclamation|title=Senate urged to concur with amnesty proclamation|website=PhilStar.com|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 43 people arrested at a community health meeting in Morong, Rizal on 6 February 2010. They were accused of being part of the NPA. On 10 December 2010, President [[Benigno Aquino III]] ordered the release of 38 of the 43 because the [[Morong 43]] case had due process violations. Seven of the released were reported to have returned to the mountains to continue the NPA's armed struggle. The last five admitted being part of the NPA and are being prosecuted for various criminal offenses including murder, extortion and other offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/12/17/10/after-10-months-jailed-morong-43-walk-free|title=After 10 months in jail, 38 members of 'Morong 43' set free|publisher=ABS-CBN|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NPA conducted attacks on 3 October 2011 against three large-scale mining corporations in [[Surigao del Norte]]. The attacks spanned only three hours, but they resulted in grave damage, including the burning of ten dump trucks, eight backhoes, two barges and a guest house. The mining firms attacked include the [[Taganito Mining Corporation]] at Taganito village in [[Claver]] town; the [[4K Mining]] at Cadiano village, also in Claver; and the [[Thpal Mining]] located near the Taganito Mining Corp. compound. The AFP claimed that the NPA attacked the mining firms because of their failure to pay "revolutionary taxes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=GMA News|title=NPA rebels attack 3 mining firms in Surigao del Norte|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/234134/news/regions/npa-rebels-attack-3-mining-firms-in-surigao-del-norte|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=GMA News Online|date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

22 March 2014 saw the arrest of Benito Tiamzon (chairman of the CPP and its armed wing, the NPA) in [[Cebu]] province along with his wife Wilma and five other members of the central committee of the CPP–NPA. Wilma Tiamzon is also the secretary general of the CPP–NPA. The arrest of the Tiamzons happened exactly a week before the 45th anniversary of the CPP–NPA on 29 March 2014. In January 2015, the NPA moved its center of operation to the City of [[Kabankalan]], Negros Occidental. NPA top officials referred to the City of Kabankalan as the "Heart and Liver of Terrorism" where they planned to attack military and civilian outposts every minute and every second of the day as part of their General Plan of Action (GPoA) for 2015. This part of the NPA GPoA, labeled the "Operation: Chiquitita", was revealed during the 15th Annual NPA Strategic Planning held at the Manila Hotel in December 2014. Police and military officers are strongly encouraged to refuse being assigned to the City of Kabangkalan, even at the risk of termination and dishonorable dismissal from the police and military force.

Plantations run by Japanese companies have been assaulted by the NPA.{{refn|&lt;ref name="manilatimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/rebels-own-up-raid-on-japanese-fruit-exporter-in-mindanao/70246/|title=Rebels own up raid on Japanese fruit exporter in Mindanao|work=ManilaTimes.net|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philippinerevolution1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinerevolution.net/statements/20121204_npa-thwarts-fascist-army-brigade-wide-clearing-operation-for-japanese-banana-firm-in-magpet|title=Archived copy|accessdate=23 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829022308/http://www.philippinerevolution.net/statements/20121204_npa-thwarts-fascist-army-brigade-wide-clearing-operation-for-japanese-banana-firm-in-magpet|archivedate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philippinerevolution1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andnowuknow.com/headlines/rebel-forces-philippines-raid-sumitomo-fruits-japanese-fruit-exporter/jordan-okumura|title=Rebel Forces in Philippines Raid Sumitomo Fruits Japanese Fruit Exporter|date=28 January 2014|work=AndNowUKnow.com|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthfirstjournal.org/newswire/2014/03/12/npa-rebels-own-up-deadly-attacks-in-philippines-vow-to-strike-at-plantations-mining-firms/|title=NPA Rebels Own up Deadly Attacks in Philippines; Vow to Strike at Plantations, Mining Firms|date=12 March 2014|work=EarthFirstJournal.org|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshfruitportal.com/news/2014/08/24/communist-rebels-attack-two-philippine-banana-plantations/|title=Communist rebels attack two Philippine banana plantations|date=24 August 2014|work=FreshFruitPortal.com|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesasia/2015/08/26/king-of-ore-despite-nickel-asias-raids-zamora-did-not-retreat/#556ef9491c29|title=King Of Ore: Despite Nickel Asia's Raids, Zamora Did Not Retreat|first=Forbes|last=Asia|date=26 August 2015|work=Forbes.com|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=7e2_1403613988|title=Philippine Rebels attack a Japanese owned Banana Plantation|work=LiveLeak.com|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6cf_1403841858|title=NPA Attack Fail|work=LiveLeak.com|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeBDtwmu01k&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Failed NPA attack at Mawab 16 Jan 2012 (WARNING: GRAPHIC)|work=youtube.com|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="manilatimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davaotoday.com/main/politics/npa-says-bukidnon-plantations-raze-done-to-stop-destructive-expansions/|title=NPA says Bukidnon plantations raze done to stop 'destructive' expansions|date=1 February 2016|work=DavaoToday.com|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philippinerevolution1"/&gt;}}{{excessive citations inline|date=August 2017}}

As of early 2017, the Defense Secretary estimates the NPA has about 5,000 members. However, the AFP estimates the NPA has only 3,700 members.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Ceasefires ===
* In November 1986, the Philippine government and rebels signed a 60-day ceasefire. This deal was scuttled in January 1987 after the events at which police opened fire and killed 13 people during a farmers' demonstration in Manila.
* The peace talks between the two sides were intermittent and inconclusive since 1986, bogging down in 2012 when the government refused to free political prisoners. They resumed in August 2016, when Duterte released 19 rebel leaders from jail. However, President Duterte scrapped talks in February 2017, when rebels ambushed an army convoy, breaking a unilateral ceasefire that had held for five months. Both sides returned to the negotiating table on 1 of April 2017.
* In April 2017, peace talks between the National Democratic Front and the Philippine government brokered by [[Norway]] took place in the [[Netherlands]], hoping to reach a political settlement in twelve months to end the conflict. This was the second time the two sides agreed on a bilateral truce since November 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/world/asia/philippines-and-communist-rebels-agree-to-a-temporary-cease-fire.html "Philippines and Communist Rebels Agree to a Temporary Cease-Fire"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North Atlantic Treaty''', also referred to as the '''Washington Treaty''', is the [[treaty]] that forms the legal basis of, and is implemented by, the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO). The treaty was signed in [[Washington, D.C.]] on 4 April 1949.

==Background==
The treaty was signed in Washington, D.C. on 4 April 1949 by a committee which was chaired by US diplomat [[Theodore Achilles]]. Earlier secret talks had been held at the Pentagon between 22 March and 1 April 1948, of which Achilles said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The talks lasted about two weeks and by the time they finished, it had been secretly agreed that there would be a treaty, and I had a draft of one in the bottom drawer of my safe. It was never shown to anyone except Jack [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[John D. Hickerson|Hickerson]]]. I wish I had kept it, but when I left the Department in 1950, I dutifully left it in the safe and I have never been able to trace it in the archives. It drew heavily on the [[Rio Treaty]], and a bit of the [[Brussels Treaty]], which had not yet been signed, but of which we were being kept heavily supplied with drafts. The eventual North Atlantic Treaty had the general form, and a good bit of the language of my first draft, but with a number of important differences.&lt;ref name="trumanlibrary1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/achilles.htm |title=Theodore Achilles Oral History Interview |publisher=Truman Library |date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Achilles, another important author of the treaty was [[John D. Hickerson]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;More than any human being Jack was responsible for the nature, content, and form of the Treaty...It was a one-man Hickerson treaty.&lt;ref name="trumanlibrary1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The treaty was created with an armed attack by the [[Soviet Union]] against Western Europe in mind, but the mutual self-defense clause was never invoked during the [[Cold War]]. Rather, it was invoked for the first time in 2001 in response to the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] against the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[The Pentagon]] in [[Operation Eagle Assist]].

==Content==

===Article 1===
Article 1 states that: "The Parties undertake, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, to settle any international dispute in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered, and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/stock_publications/20120822_nato_treaty_en_light_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article 2===
Article 2 states that: "The Parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening their free institutions, by bringing about a better understanding of the principles upon which these institutions are founded, and by promoting conditions of stability and well-being. They will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any or all of them."

===Article 3===
Article 3 states that: "In order more effectively to achieve the objectives of this Treaty, the Parties, separately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, will maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack."

===Article 4===
Article 4 states that: "The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened."

The treaty includes Article 4, which triggers not military intervention but merely consultation over military matters when "the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened".&lt;ref name=dt26/&gt;

It has been invoked three times by Turkey: once in 2003 over the Second Persian Gulf War ([[Iraq War]]), once in June 2012 after the shooting down of a Turkish military jet, and once again in October 2012 after Syrian attacks on Turkey and their counterattacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49187.htm?selectedLocale=en|title=The consultation process and Article 4|website=NATO.int|date=4 March 2014|accessdate=4 March 2014|quote=Since the Alliance's creation in 1949, Article 4 has been invoked several times.... On two occasions in 2012, Turkey requested that the North Atlantic Council (NAC) convene under Article 4: once on 22 June after one of its fighter jets was shot down by Syrian air defence forces and the second time on 3 October when five Turkish civilians were killed by Syrian shells....

===Article 5===
The key section of the treaty is Article 5. Its commitment clause defines the ''[[casus foederis]]''. It commits each member state to consider an armed attack against ''one'' member state, in Europe or North America, to be an armed attack against ''them all''.

It has been invoked only once in NATO history: by the United States after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/nato-welcome/index.html NATO: Key Events (timeline)], 2001: "Large-scale terrorist attacks in New York and Washington D.C.—NATO invokes Article 5 for the first time ever and adopts a broader approach to security" (See also: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ-Dxg-SMPM Public statement of casus foederis])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/13/us/after-attacks-alliance-for-first-time-nato-invokes-joint-defense-pact-with-us.html|title=AFTER THE ATTACKS: THE ALLIANCE; For First Time, NATO Invokes Joint Defense Pact With U.S.|last=Daley|first=Suzanne|date=2001-09-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-26|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invocation was confirmed on 4 October 2001, when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2001/1001/e1002a.htm |title=NATO Update: Invocation of Article 5 confirmed – 2 October 2001 |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the 9/11 attacks included [[Operation Eagle Assist|Operation ''Eagle Assist'']] and [[Operation Active Endeavour|Operation ''Active Endeavour'']], a naval operation in the [[Mediterranean]] which was designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction, as well as enhancing the security of shipping in general.

Article 6 states that the treaty covers only member nations' territories in Europe and North America, and islands in the North Atlantic north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], plus [[French Algeria]]. It was the opinion in August 1965 of the US State Department, the US Defense Department and the legal division of NATO that an attack on the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]] would not trigger the treaty, but an attack on the other 49 would.&lt;ref name="hall19650808"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1965/08/08/page/28/article/hawaii-lacks-nato-coverage-if-attacked | title=Hawaii Lacks NATO Coverage if Attacked | work=Chicago Tribune | date=1965-08-08 | agency=UPI | accessdate=29 April 2015 | author=Hall, John | pages=Section 1A, Page 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 April 2003, NATO agreed to take command of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) in [[Afghanistan]], which includes troops from 42 countries. The decision came at the request of Germany and the Netherlands, the two nations leading ISAF at the time of the agreement, and all nineteen NATO ambassadors approved it unanimously. The handover of control to NATO took place on 11&amp;nbsp;August, and marked the first time in NATO's history that it took charge of a mission outside the north Atlantic area.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Auerswald, and Stephen M. Saideman, eds. ''NATO in Afghanistan: Fighting Together, Fighting Alone'' (Princeton U.P., 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pangat''' is a word derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''pankti'' ([http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/macdonell_query.py?qs=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%99%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF&amp;searchhws=yes पङ्क्ति]) that means a line, a row, or a group. It is a synonym for ''Guru Ka Langar''. In a Pangat, food is served by volunteers (Sevadars) to people of all religions who sit together to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Pangat|title=Pangat - SikhiWiki, free Sikh encyclopedia.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pangat is about eating food while sitting in rows with no discrimination on the basis of [[caste]], [[creed]] and [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/sikh-institutions/sangat-and-pangat|title=Sangat and Pangat - Sikh Institutions - Gateway to Sikhism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the beliefs of Sikhism, nobody sleeps without eating, nor should anybody die of hunger.

== History ==
Pangat and Sangat came together from the time of [[Guru Nanak|Guru Nanak Dev Ji]], the first Guru of [[Sikh]]ism. Nanak's father gave him money for trade that he spent on feeding hungry [[Sadhu]]s. He named this that ''True Transaction'' (Sacha Sauda). Where there is Sangat, there is always a Langar (food service).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sikhism.about.com/od/sikhdiningtradition/tp/All-About-Langar.htm|title=All About Sacred Langar and the Guru's Free Kitchen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sikh principles all people (Sangat) who sit in pangat share food on equal basis. 

In the history of Sikhism, when [[Akbar|Emperor Akbar]] and the King of Haripur went to meet Guru Amar Das Ji, the third Guru of Sikhism. They both had to eat Langar in the pangat before meeting the Guru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhmissionarysociety.org/sms/smssikhism/institutions/pangat/|title=Sikh Missionary Society(U.K.) - Sikhism - Institutions - Pangat|first=Amarpreet Singh|last=Munde|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1861">A '''partnership limited by shares''' is a hybrid between a [[partnership]] and a [[limited liability company]].  The [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and ownership of the [[company]] is divided between [[shareholder]]s who have a limited liability and one or more partners who have full liability for the remainder of the company's [[debt]]s.  The partner(s) will usually direct the operations of the company while the shareholders are passive investors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4812">Since the 1970s '''party finance in Sweden''' on all levels of the political system depends heavily on public subsidies&lt;ref&gt;Gullan M. Gidlund, ''Partistöd'', Umea: CWK Gleerup, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; With an estimated SEK 146 (more than $17) per voter a year the spending level is among the highest in the world of established democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Heinz Nassmacher: ''The Funding of Party Competition'', Baden-Baden: Nomos Verlag, 2009, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of funds==
Public subsidies are the major source of party funds in Sweden. At the national level they provide 80 to 90 per cent of the major parties' annual revenue.

==Items of spending==
With all Swedish parties "annual routine spending is far more important than extra campaign expenses".&lt;ref&gt;Gullan Gidlund and Ruud Koole, 'Political Finance in the North of Europe (The Netherlands and Sweden)'. In: Karl-Heinz Nassmacher (ed.), ''Foundations for Democracy'', Baden-Baden: Nomos Verlag, 2001, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation of political money==
As a consequence of the preservation of internal autonomy of political parties as voluntary associations there was no regulation whatsoever for many years. Parties and lawmakers believed that this autonomy had to be preserved.
When [[GRECO]] started to evaluate "Transparency of Party Funding" in [[Council of Europ]]e member states the organization recommended to require political parties "to keep proper books and accounts ... to ensure that income, expenditure, assets and debts are accounted for in a comprehensive manner following a coherent format", to consolidate such accounts to include local branches and provide for an easy access of the general public to the annual accounts of political parties.&lt;ref&gt;Third Evaluation Round, Compliance Report on Sweden, Greco RC-III (2011) 4E, p. 4. [http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/evaluations/round3/GrecoRC3(2011)4_Sweden_EN.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish authorities replied "that they did not have any reason to believe that the longstanding self regulation" needs to be amended.&lt;ref&gt;Third Evaluation Round, Compliance Report on Sweden, Greco RC-III (2011) 4E, p. 5. [http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/evaluations/round3/GrecoRC3(2011)4_Sweden_EN.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of 2012 the Swedish government had "decided to initiate a legislative process with the purpose of ... making information regarding the funding of political parties more accessible. ... draft legislation would be submitted to Parliament in autumn 2013."&lt;ref&gt;Third Evaluation Round, Second Interim Compliance Report on Sweden, Greco RC-III (2012) 22E, p. 3. [http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/evaluations/round3/GrecoRC3(2012)22_Sweden_2nd%20Interim_EN.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4986">In competitive debate, most commonly in the [[World Schools Style debate|World Schools]], Karl Popper, and [[British Parliamentary Style|British Parliamentary]] [[debate]] styles, a Point of Information (POI) is when a member of the team opposing that of the current speaker gets to briefly interrupt the current speaker, offering a POI in the form of a question or a statement. This may be as a correction, asking for clarity, or just a plain question. As in some debating styles, such as [[Parliamentary debate#World Schools Style|World Schools Style]], they often may not be offered in the first or last minute of any speech (known as ''protected time''), or during reply speeches. Points of information may never be offered to a member of the same team.

Points of information are an important part of any debate that includes them, as they offer a much greater degree of engagement between teams. In some styles of debate, such as [[British Parliamentary Style]], they take on an even greater importance, as teams are forced to use them in order to maintain their relevance during a debate. Furthermore, they allow speakers to demonstrate greater wit and presence of thought than is generally possible in a speech, as they are required to respond instantly to prepared points from their opposition in a logical way.

A point of information is also a [[Requests and inquiries#Request for information|request for information]] from the current speaker, in ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]''.  The 11th edition of ''Robert's Rules'', published in 2011, changes the name to ''request for information'' to clarify its purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|title = RONR|edition = 11th|year = 2011|pages = 294–295}}(RONR)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etiquette==
In all competitions that allow points of information, their use is restricted by a number of rules to allow the speaker to maintain control of their speech. Generally, the procedure for offering a point of information is as follows:

# The opposing team member stands, and offers the point.
# The speaker then either accepts or declines the point, or else offers to accept it at the end of the sentence. The speaker is required to accept in a short statement such as "Taken", "Yes sir/ma'am", and so on. If the speaker wishes, they have the right to decline by saying "No, thank you", "Not taken", and so on
# If accepted, the debater that offered the point may then briefly interject a point, question or statement. Generally, this must be done in fifteen seconds or less, and the speaker may cut the opposing offer off at any point.
# The speaker must then immediately answer the point of information.

A [[rule of thumb]] for points of information is that each speaker should accept two during the course of his or her speech, and offer two to every opposing speaker. Taking fewer points may be interpreted as cowardice when plenty were offered, while speakers that accept too many risk losing control of their speech. Similarly, it is generally frowned upon for speakers to offer excessive POIs, a practice known as ''badgering'' that usually results in the adjudicator calling the debate to order.

Points of Information, as with any other debating technique, are subject to each speaker's own personal style. For instance, while it is broadly accepted that a debater should stand when offering a point of information, there is no set wording or format for the offer itself. Examples of valid offers, that may be combined with any of several common hand [[gesture]]s, are:
 
*"On a point of information."
* "May I have this point, sir/miss"
* "On [''subject''] (e.g., [[political capital]] or feasibility)"
* "On that point, sir/miss"
*"POI, sir/ma'am?" 
*"Point, sir/ma'am"
*

Similarly, there is no set way of dealing with a point of information. While a speaker would ideally refute or otherwise deal with it on the spot, it is also acceptable for them to refer the opposing member to another part of their speech (i.e., "I will be dealing with this in greater detail later in my speech."), or to refer the entire point to another of their speakers (i.e., "This point is clearly incorrect. My second speaker will argue..."). While speakers are not explicitly marked for the quality of their points of information or responses to them, they often help to create the impression of skill and improve their overall mark.

==Types==

Points of information may be offered in several forms, depending on the style of debating being used. The two most common of these are:

* ''Points of information'', where a debater simply offers an argument or question to the speaker.
* ''Points of misrepresentation'', which allow the opposing team to point out that the speaker is misrepresenting its argument or setting up a [[straw man]]. This point does not even require the speaker's acceptance, as the mere offer of a point of misrepresentation highlights that the speaker is unfairly treating their opposition.

'''RECOFTC – The Center for People and Forests''' is an international not-for-profit organization that focuses on [[capacity building]] for [[community forestry]] in the Asia Pacific region. It advocates for the increased involvement of local communities living in and around forests - some 450 million people in Asia-Pacific -  in the  equitable and ecologically sustainable management of forest landscapes. The Regional Community Forestry Training Center for Asia and the Pacific (RECOFTC) opened in Bangkok, Thailand, in March 1987 with support from the [[United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization]], the Government of Switzerland (through the [[Asian Development Bank]]), and Thailand's [[Kasetsart University]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Originally a regional training and research hub for community forestry, RECOFTC now works on the ground through a network of strategic partnerships with governments, NGOs, development organizations and local people throughout Asia-Pacific, and has worked in parts of Africa. In 1999, a charter was developed with a proposal to turn RECOFTC into an international organization, which was signed by seven countries (all the [[Mekong]] countries and Switzerland). In 2000, the Royal Thai Government (RTG) signed an agreement with RECOFTC that formally recognized the Center as an autonomous [[International nongovernmental organization|international organization]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Training, capacity building and other learning activities remain central to RECOFTC's work, now complemented with on-the-ground projects, policy work, and strategic communications. In 2009, the organization adopted the new name RECOFTC – The Center for People and Forests to reflect this broader scope of work.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

To strengthen its regional program, RECOFTC established country program offices in Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam in 2010.

== Thematic areas ==
The Center’s work is focused in four thematic areas:

*'''Expanding community forestry:''' Through frontline country programs, RECOFTC works to secure rights for forest-dependent communities to manage their forests.
*'''People, forests, and climate change
*'''Transforming forest conflict
*'''Securing local livelihoods

The Center's portfolio currently includes over 40 projects and services, including large capacity-building projects for [[UN-REDD|REDD+]] regionally and for community forestry in Cambodia.

== Capacity building ==
Since its inception in 1987 as a regional training institution for forestry, the Center has trained over ten thousand practitioners at all levels in community forestry. The Center’s capacity-building program&lt;ref&gt;RECOFTC Training Center: {{cite web |url=http://www.recoftc.org/site/Training-Center/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831043146/http://www.recoftc.org/site/Training-Center/ |archivedate=2011-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of training courses, learning activities and networks, workshops, and study tours. The program seeks to enhance skills in its four thematic areas, listed above.

{{context|date=November 2018}}


The '''Rice index''' is a metric which indicates the degree of agreement, or roll-call cohesion, within any sized voting body. A result of 0 indicates a stalemate, while a 1 indicates a perfect consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Born |first1=Richard |last2=Nevison |first2=Christopher |date=1974 |title=The Agreement Level Measure, and the Rice Index of Cohesion Revisited |journal=American Journal of Political Science |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=617–624 |jstor=2110636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formula is often used in the social sciences, and is the ratio of the difference between majority and minority to the sum of majority and minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rice |first=Stuart A. |date=1938 |title=Quantitative Methods in Politics |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=33 |issue=201 |pages=126–130 |jstor=2279119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;RI = \frac{|\text{yes} - \text{no}|}{\text{yes} + \text{no}}&lt;/math&gt;

Yes = Number of yes votes, No = Number of votes against.

It is named for Stuart A. Rice (1889-1969), Chairman of the United States Central Statistical Board, president of the American Statistical Association in 1933 and Assistant Director of the Office of Statistical Standards in the Bureau of the Budget from 1940-1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1969 |title=The American Satistician |url=http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2010/09/01/rice9_10/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Safety culture''' is the collection of the beliefs, perceptions and values that employees share in relation to '''risks''' within an organization, such as a workplace or community.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, S. &amp; Cox, T. (1991) The structure of employee attitudes to safety - a European example Work and Stress, 5, 93 - 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rip|first=Arie|title=The danger culture of industrial society|date=1991|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-1952-5_16|work=Communicating Risks to the Public|pages=345–365|publisher=Springer Netherlands|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-009-1952-5_16|isbn=9789401073721|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safety culture is a part of [[organizational culture]], and has been described in a variety of ways; notably the National Academies of Science and the Association of Land Grant and Public Universities have published summaries on this topic in 2014 and 2016 .&lt;ref&gt;ZCBI (1991) Developing a Safety Culture., Confederation of British Industry, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southernlibrarianship.icaap.org/content/v07n01/martin_m01.htm|title=That's the Way We Do Things Around Here|author=|date=|website=southernlibrarianship.icaap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aplu.org/library/safety-culture/file|title=A guide to implementing a SAFETY CULTURE in our universities|last=|first=|date=April 2016|website=APLU.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dels.nas.edu/Report/Safe-Science-Promoting-Culture/18706|title=Safe Science: Promoting a Culture of Safety in Academic Chemical Research (2014) : Division on Earth and Life Studies|website=dels.nas.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found that workplace related disasters are a result of a breakdown in an organization’s policies and procedures that were established to deal with safety, and that the breakdown flows from inadequate attention being paid to safety issues.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

A good safety culture can be promoted by senior management commitment to safety, realistic practices for handling hazards, continuous organisational learning, and care and concern for hazards shared across the workforce.

==History of concept==
The [[Chernobyl disaster]] highlighted the importance of safety culture and the effect of managerial and human factors on safety performance.&lt;ref&gt;Flin, R., Mearns, K., O'Conner, P. &amp; Bryden, R. (2000) Measuring safety Climate: Identifying the common features Safety Science 34, 177 - 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IAEA, (1991) Safety Culture (Safety Series No. 75-INSAG-4) International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna&lt;/ref&gt; The term ‘safety culture’ was first used in INSAG’s (1986) ‘Summary Report on the Post-Accident Review Meeting on the Chernobyl Accident’ where safety culture was described as:

"That assembly of characteristics and attitudes in organizations and individuals which establishes that, as an overriding priority, nuclear plant safety issues receive the attention warranted by their significance."

Since then, a number of definitions of safety culture have been published. The U.K. Health and Safety Commission developed one of the most commonly used definitions of safety culture:
"The product of individual and group values, attitudes, perceptions, competencies, and patterns of behaviour that determine the commitment to, and the style and proficiency of, an organisation’s health and safety management".&lt;ref name=ACSNI3&gt;HSC (Health And Safety Commission), 1993. Third report: organising for safety. ACSNI Study Group on Human Factors. HMSO, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Organisations with a positive safety culture are characterized by communications founded on mutual trust, by shared perceptions of the importance of safety and by confidence in the efficacy of preventive measures."

[[File:Forstarbeiter.jpg|thumb|Doing a job with inadequate safety equipment{{clarify|date=September 2018}}&lt;!-- what equipment is missing here?--&gt; may indicate a poor safety culture]]
The Cullen Report into the [[Ladbroke Grove rail crash]] saw safety culture as "the way we typically do things around here"; this would imply that every organisation has a safety culture – just some a better one than others. The concept of 'safety culture' originally arose in connection with major organisational accidents, where it provides a crucial insight into how multiple organisational barriers against such accidents can be simultaneously ineffective: "With each disaster that occurs our knowledge of the factors which make organisations vulnerable to failures has grown. It has become clear that such vulnerability does not originate from just ‘human error’, chance environmental factors or technological failures alone. Rather, it is the ingrained organisational policies and standards which have repeatedly been shown to predate the catastrophe."&lt;ref name=Gadd&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gadd|first1=S|last2=Collins|first2=A M|title=Safety Culture: A review of the literature HSL/2002/25|date=2002|publisher=Health &amp; Safety Laboratory|location=Sheffield|page=3|accessdate=9 April 2015}}[url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/hsl_pdf/2002/hsl02-25.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
However it is now also applied (with less certain validity) to individual accidents, and hence has come to relate to a full range of safety behaviors from the wearing of PPE (or not), the quality of delivery of a tool box talk,{{clarify|date=September 2018}} the quality of shopfloor response to fault conditions  – or (what is frequently the main concern for major accidents) the extent to which safety considerations influence high level meetings and management decisions. A new starter or recently arrived sub contractor will soon pick up what the local norms are and be heavily influenced by them.  If a tipping point of around 90% compliance is observed then these individuals will be highly likely to comply too – but if these individuals observe a 50:50 split then they may feel they have free choice as whatever they do they won't stand out.

The safety culture of an organization and its safety management system are closely related, but the relationship is not simply that the safety culture complies with the formal safety management system 
The safety culture of an organization cannot be created or changed overnight; it develops over time as a result of history, work environment, the workforce, health and safety practices, and management leadership: "Organizations, like organisms, adapt".&lt;ref name= Reason/&gt;  An organization’s safety culture is ultimately reflected in the way safety is addressed in its workplaces (whether boardroom or shopfloor). In reality an organization's safety management system is not a set of policies and procedures on a bookshelf, but how those policies and procedures are implemented into the workplace, which will be influenced by the safety culture of the organization or workplace.&lt;ref name=KenKir&gt;Kennedy, R. &amp; Kirwan, B., (1995) The failure mechanisms of safety culture. In: Carnino, A. and Weimann, G., Editors, 1995. Proceedings of the International Topical Meeting on Safety Culture in Nuclear Installations, American Nuclear Society of Austria, Vienna, pp. 281–290.&lt;/ref&gt;  The UK HSE notes that safety culture is not just (nor even most significantly) an issue of shopfloor worker attitudes and behaviours  "Many companies talk about ‘safety culture’ when referring to the inclination of their employees to comply with rules or act safety or unsafely. However we find that the culture and style of management is even more significant, for example a natural, unconscious bias for production over safety, or a tendency to focussing on the short-term and being highly reactive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organisational Culture|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/humanfactors/topics/culture.htm|website=Health and Safety Executive|accessdate=7 April 2015}}(see [[Aberfan disaster]], [[Flixborough disaster]], for two notable UK events that may have informed this view)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Since the 1980s there has been a large amount of research into safety culture. However the concept remains largely "ill defined".&lt;ref&gt;Guldenmund, F. W. (2000) The nature of safety culture: a review of theory and research Safety Science, 34, 215-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the literature there are a number of varying definitions of safety culture with arguments for and against the concept. Two of the most prominent and most-commonly used definitions are those given above from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) and from the UK [[Health and Safety Commission]] (HSC).&lt;ref name= Yule/&gt; However, there are some common characteristics shared by other definitions. Some characteristics associated with safety culture include the incorporation of beliefs, values and attitudes. A critical feature of safety culture is that it is shared by a group.&lt;ref name=ACSNI3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pidgeon&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pidgeon | first1 = N. | last2 = O'Leary | first2 = M. | year = 2000 | title = Man-Made Disasters: why technology and organizations (sometimes) fail | url = | journal = Safety Science | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 15–30 | doi=10.1016/s0925-7535(00)00004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When defining safety culture some authors focus on attitudes, where others see safety culture being expressed through behaviours and activities.&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt; The safety culture of an organization can be a critical influence on human performance in safety-related tasks and hence on the safety performance of the organization. Many proprietary and academic methods claim to assess safety culture, but few have been validated against actual safety performance. The vast majority of surveys examine key issues such as leadership, involvement, commitment, communication, and incident reporting. Some safety culture maturity tools are used in focus group exercises, though few of these (even the most popular) have been examined against company incident rates.

==Broken culture==
[[File:Challenger explosion.jpg|thumb|The first obvious sign of a poor safety culture may be a major accident e.g. the Challenger explosion]]Although there is some uncertainty and ambiguity in defining safety culture, there is no uncertainty over the relevance or significance of the concept.&lt;ref name=Yule&gt;Yule, S. (2003) Safety culture and safety climate: a review of the literature. Industrial Psychology Research Centre 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Mearns et al.&lt;ref name=Mearns/&gt; stated that "safety culture is an important concept that forms the environment within which individual safety attitudes develop and persist and safety behaviours are promoted". With every major disaster, considerable resources are allocated to identify factors that might have contributed to the outcome of the event. Consideration of the considerable detail revealed by inquiries into such disasters is invaluable in identifying generic factors that "make organisations vulnerable to failures" From such inquiries, a pattern emerges; organizational accidents are not a result of randomly coinciding "operator error", chance environmental or technical failures alone. Rather, the disasters are a result of a breakdown in the organization's policies and procedures that were established to deal with safety, and the breakdown flows from inadequate attention being paid to safety issues. In the UK, investigations into incidents such as the sinking of the [[MS Herald of Free Enterprise]] passenger ferry (Sheen, 1987), the [[King's Cross fire|Kings Cross underground station fire]] (1987) and the [[Piper Alpha]] oil platform explosion (1988)&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;Cullen, W.D., 1990. The Public Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster. HMSO, London.&lt;/ref&gt; raised awareness of the effect of organisational, managerial and human factors on safety outcomes, and the decisive effect of 'safety culture' on those factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reason | first1 = J | year = 1990 | title = The contribution of latent human failures to the breakdown of complex systems | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume = 327 | issue = | pages = 475–484 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1990.0090}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, similar issues were found to underlie the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]], subsequent investigation of which identified that cultural issues had influenced numerous "flawed" decisions on behalf of [[NASA]] and [[Thiokol]] management that had contributed to the disaster. The lesson drawn from the UK disasters was that, "It is essential to create a corporate atmosphere or culture in which safety is understood to be and is accepted as, the number one priority."&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt;{{rp|300}}

From public enquiries it has become evident that a broken safety vulture is responsible for many of the major process safety disasters that have taken place around the world over the past 20 years or so.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, M.D. &amp; Findley, L.J. (2013). 'Strategic Safety Culture Roadmap'. BSMS Inc. Franklin, IN, USA&lt;/ref&gt; Typical features related to these disasters are where there had been a culture of:
* "Profit before safety", where productivity always came before safety, as safety was viewed as a cost, not an investment. 
* "Fear", so that problems remained hidden as they are driven underground by those trying to avoid sanctions or reprimands. 
* "Ineffective leadership'', where blinkered leadership and the prevailing corporate culture prevented the recognition of risks and opportunities leading to wrong safety decisions being made at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons.
* "Non-compliance" to standards, rules and procedures by managers and the workforce. 
* "Miscommunication", where critical safety information had not been relayed to decision-makers and/ or the message had been diluted.  
* "Competency failures", where there were false expectations that direct hires and contractors were highly trained and competent. 
* "Ignoring lessons learned", where safety critical information was not extracted, shared or enforced.

"Tough guy" attributes like unwillingness to admit ignorance, admit mistakes, or ask for help can undermine safety culture and productivity, by interfering with exchange of useful information. A Harvard Business School study found an intervention to improve the culture at [[Shell Oil]] during the construction of the [[Ursa tension leg platform]] contributed to increased productivity and an 84% lower accident rate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/17/482203447/invisibilia-how-learning-to-be-vulnerable-can-make-life-safer Invisibilia: How Learning To Be Vulnerable Can Make Life Safer]&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[Korean Air incidents and accidents|a number of Korean Air crashes]], and particularly after the [[Korean Air Cargo Flight 8509]] crash, a December 1999 review found that a culture of overly strong [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchichy]] (influenced in general Korean culture by [[Confucianism]]) prevented subordinates from speaking up in safety-critical situations. The airline's safety record later improved considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Don.

Gladwell notes (p. 180) that the [[Aviation accidents and incidents|hull-loss]] rate for the airline was 4.79 per million departures, a full 17 times greater than [[United Airlines]] which at the same time had a loss rate of just 0.27 per million departures.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113676875085241209 Korean Air Bucks Tradition To Fix Problems]."

== Ideal culture ==
Reason&lt;ref name = Reason&gt;Reason, J. (1998) Achieving a safe culture: theory and practice Work and Stress, 12, 293-306.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|294}} considers an ideal safety culture "the ‘engine’ that drives the system towards the goal of sustaining the maximum resistance towards its operational hazards" regardless of current commercial concerns or leadership style.  This requires a constant high level of respect for anything that might defeat safety systems and ‘not forgetting to be afraid’.  Complex systems with defence-in-depth (such as would be expected for a major hazard plant) become opaque to most if not all of their managers and operators. Their design should ensure that no single failure will lead to an accident, or even to a revealed near-miss, and there are no timely reminders to be afraid.  For such systems, Reason argues, there is an ‘absence of sufficient accidents to steer by’ and the desired state of ‘intelligent and respectful wariness’ will be lost unless sustained by the collection, analysis and dissemination of knowledge from incidents and revealed near misses.  It is very dangerous to think that an organization is safe because no information is saying otherwise, but it is also very easy.  An organisation that underestimates danger will be insufficiently concerned about poor working conditions, poor working practices, poor equipment reliability, and even identified deficiencies in the defences-in-depth: the plant is still safe ‘by massive margins’, so why rock the boat?&lt;ref name = Reason/&gt; Hence, without conscious efforts to prevent it, complex systems with major hazards are both particularly vulnerable to (and particularly prone to develop) a poor safety culture.

E. Scott Geller has written of a "total safety culture" (TSC) achieved through implementing applied behavioral techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accidents to individuals==
Over the years, a lot of attention has focused on the causes of occupational incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Haslam, R. A., Hide, S. A., Gibb, A. G. F., Gyi, D. E., Pavitt, T., Atkinson, S. &amp; Duff, A. R. (2004) Contributing factors in construction accidents Applied Ergonomics 36, 401-415.&lt;/ref&gt; When incidents occur in the workplace it is important to understand what factors (human, technical, organizational) may have contributed to the outcome in order to avoid similar incidents in the future. Through developing an understanding of why and how incidents occur, appropriate methods for incident prevention can be developed (Williamson and Feyer 2002). In the past, improvement in workplace safety or in the control of workplace risks has come about through the provision of safer machinery or processes, the better training of employees, and the introduction of formal safety management systems.  Consequently, (some argue) in  a workplace that has benefited from these improvements, many of the residual workplace accidents result from operator error — one or more operators doing a job differently from the safe way they were trained to.&lt;ref&gt;HSE Human Factors Briefing Note No. 7 Safety Culture at {{cite web|title=Organisational Culture|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/humanfactors/topics/culture.htm|website=Health And Safety Executive|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, there is now a move to apply the concept of safety culture at the individual level; worker behaviour is influenced by the safety culture of an organization, so safety culture could affect the worker injury rate.&lt;ref name=Glendon&gt;Glendon, A. I., Clarke, S. G. &amp; McKenna, E. F. (2006) Human Safety and Risk Management, Florida, CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the overall culture of an organization may affect the behaviour of employees, much research has focused on the effect of more localised factors (i.e. supervisors, interpretation of safety policies) in the specific culture of individual workplaces, leading to the concept of a "Local safety climate, which is more susceptible to transition and change".&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;{{rp|367}} This would also suggest that safety climate operates on a different level than safety culture. Mearns et al.&lt;ref name=Mearns&gt;Mearns, K., Whitaker, S. M. &amp; Flin, R. (2003) Safety Climate, safety management practice and safety performance in offshore environments Safety Science, 41, 641-680.&lt;/ref&gt; note that although safety culture was a concept originally used to describe the inadequacies of safety management that result in major disasters, that the concept is now being applied to explain accidents at the individual level, although as they emphasize, "The validity of the safety culture concept with regard to individual accidents is yet to be ascertained." (p.&amp;nbsp;643).

Pidgeon and O’Leary argue "a ‘good’ safety culture might reflect and be promoted by four factors&lt;ref name=Pidgeon/&gt; 
* Senior management commitment to safety 
* Realistic and flexible customs and practices for handling both well-defined and ill-defined hazards
* continuous organisational learning through practices such as feedback systems, monitoring, and analysis
* Care and concern for hazards shared across the workforce
Only two of those factors fall within a management system, and leadership as well as management is necessary.

Several papers  (e.g., for the UK offshore oil industry -Mearns et al. (2000)&lt;ref name=Mearns/&gt;) have sought to identify specific safety management practices that predict (conventional) safety performance. Shannon (1998)&lt;ref name=shannon1998&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shannon|first1=Harry|title=Firm level organizational practices. A report to the Royal Commission on Workers' Compensation in British Columbia|date=1998|publisher=Institute for Work and Health|location=Toronto|url=http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/rcwc/research/|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives details of many reported surveys in Canada and the US and reports the conclusions of

Variables consistently related to lower injury rates included both those specified by a safety management system and purely cultural factors.

==Process safety management==
{{main|Process safety management}}

Control of major accident hazards requires a specific focus on process-safety management over and above conventional safety management, and Anderson (2004) has expressed concern at the implications for management of major hazards of the extension of the "safety culture" concept to justify behavioural safety initiatives to reduce injury (or lost-time accident) rates by improving safety culture.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite book|last1= Anderson|first1= M|title= Behavioural safety and major accident hazards: Magic bullet or shot in the dark? in Conference Proceedings, Hazards XVIII Symposium, 24 November 2004.|date= 2004|publisher= IChemE/UMIST|location= Manchester|url= http://www.hse.gov.uk/humanfactors/topics/magicbullet.pdf|accessdate= 10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that "loss of containment" rates on major hazard sites give a good indication of how well the major accident risks are managed; UK studies show no significant correlation with "lost time accident" rates. Furthermore, behavioural safety has come to be targeted{{by whom|date=August 2015}} on reducing the propensity for error of front line staff by getting them to be more careful; UK studies have shown that the vast majority of frontline errors are not free-standing, but are triggered by preceding errors by more senior grades. (In a study of over 700 loss-of-containment events in the 1990s - of 110 incidents due to maintenance, only 17 were due to a failure to ensure that planned maintenance procedures were followed: 93 were due to a failure by the organisation to provide adequate maintenance procedures. Under 6% of incidents were due to front-line personnel deliberately not following procedures.).&lt;ref name=anderson /&gt; There can be no objection to behavioural safety initiatives to reduce the rate of lost-time accidents, provided that they do not divert effort from the management of major hazards and that a low lost-time accident rate does not give rise to unwarranted complacency about the major hazard.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Measuring safety culture==

The tools used to assess safety culture are normally questionnaires.&lt;ref name="Kinesa et al 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169814111001028 |title=Nordic Safety Climate Questionnaire (NOSACQ-50): A new tool for diagnosing occupational safety climate |journal=International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=6 |date=November 2011 |pages=634–646 |first1=Pete |last1=Kinesa |first2=Jorma |last2=Lappalainen |first3=Kim |last3=Lyngby Mikkelsen |first4=Espen |last4=Olsen |first5=Anders |last5=Pousette |first6=Jorunn |last6=Tharaldsen |first7=Kristinn |last7=Tómasson |first8=Marianne |last8=Törnerd |doi=10.1016/j.ergon.2011.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to differences of national and organizational cultures, as well as different approaches in studies and researches, many types of safety culture questionnaires have emerged. For example, in oil companies a safety culture questionnaire was developed in UK. Another questionnaire in the same field was developed in Iran.&lt;ref name="Arghami et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arghami |first1=S. |last2=Nouri Parkestani |first2= H. |last3=Alimohammadi |first3=I. |date=2013 |title=Reliability and validity of a safety climate questionnaire. |journal=Journal of research in health sciences |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=140–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Titan traffic database''' is a [[database]] allegedly in use by the Swedish [[signals intelligence]] agency, the [[National Defence Radio Establishment (Sweden)|National Defence Radio Establishment]] (FRA), according to a news report by ''[[Rapport (news programme)|Rapport]]'' on [[SVT]] in June 2008, based on an account from an [[anonymous source]]. The source alleged the agency had been storing "massive amounts of information" about "who have been talking to whom, but no content";&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2496">'''USDA Office of Rural Development''' (RD) is an agency with the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] which runs programs intended to improve the economy and quality of life in [[rural]] America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rd.usda.gov/about-rd/mission-history USDA Rural Development: Mission &amp; History] Retrieved on February 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural Development has a loan portfolio over $224.5 billion, and administers nearly $16 billion in program loans, loan guarantees, and grants through their programs. Rural Development promotes economic development by supporting loans to businesses through banks, credit unions and community-managed lending pools. It offers technical assistance and information to help agricultural producers and cooperatives get started and improve the effectiveness of their operations. Rural Development also provides technical assistance to help communities undertake community empowerment programs and helps rural residents buy or rent safe, affordable housing and make health and safety repairs to their homes.

==History==
The '''Rural Development Administration''' (RDA) was a USDA agency established by the [[1990 farm bill]] (P.L. 101-624, Sec. 2302), amending the [[Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972]] (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.), to administer [[Farmers Home Administration|FmHA]] community and business programs and other USDA rural development programs. RDA was superseded by the '''Office of Rural Development''' following the 1994 reorganization of USDA authorized by P.L. 103-354.

On October 13, 1994, the Department of Agriculture was reorganized under the [[Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994]] and [[Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994]]. Under that act, USDA Rural Development was created to administer the former [[Farmers Home Administration]]'s (FmHA) non-farm financial programs for rural housing, community facilities, water and waste disposal, and rural businesses. The former [[Rural Electrification Administration]]'s (REA) utility programs were also consolidated within Rural Development. The current leader of Rural Development is Assistant to the Secretary Anne Hazlett.

A '''voter database''' is a [[database]] containing information on voters for the purpose of assisting a [[political party]] or an individual [[politician]], in their [[Get out the vote]] (GOTV) efforts and other areas of the campaign.

In most countries, the election agency makes the [[electoral roll]] available to all campaigns soon after the election campaign has begun. Campaigns can then merge this information with the other data they have collected on voters over the years to create their database.  Often basic information such as [[phone number]]s and [[postal code]]s are not included on the voters list, and the campaign will have to procure this data as well.

The [[United States]] does not have a federal election agency, and thus has no official national voter list. In 2002, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Help America Vote Act]] (HAVA). HAVA required that each state compile an official state voter database by January 2006. Most states complied with HAVA by gathering the [[voter file]]s available from each individual county. States decided what information to include, what restrictions to place on the use of their voter database, and how much the database would cost. In the United States, several companies have merged state voter information with commercially obtained data to create comprehensive voter databases that include a plethora of personal details on each voter. These companies often provide United States Voter Files to statutorily permitted or otherwise non-restricted users.

==Uses==
The voter database is central to many parts of a campaign:
*Fundraising: The database can determine who should receive fundraising [[direct mail]] or telephone calls. These letters and calls can be tailored to reflect the issues and concerns of each potential donor. Past donor history, support for related advocacy groups, magazine subscriptions, and consumer behaviour can all be used to find likely donors and maximize the returns of any fundraising efforts.
*Recruitment: As with fundraising, databases, especially those with detailed past election behaviour, are essential to recruiting volunteers and also finding locations for [[lawn sign]]s.
*Issue tracking: A campaign can track how certain issues are perceived across geographic and demographic lines and can show how to adjust the campaign's message for different audiences. By databasing all incoming telephone calls and e-mails as well as entering petitions and supporter lists from advocacy groups and NGOs (Non-Government Organizations) one can closely track how issues are followed by the electorate.
*[[Get out the vote]]: One of the most important parts of a modern campaign is the campaign to ensure one's own supporters go to the polls on election day, and databases are central to this. A successful [[voter identification]] campaign requires connecting with a significant portion of the electorate and recording how they are going to vote in a database. On election day this information needs to be given out with accurate contact information for each voter so that they can be pulled to the polls.

==Voter information==
Personal data frequently included in a voter database:

* Name
* Physical address
* Mailing address
* Phone number
* Party membership or affiliation
* Voting history (including federal, sub-national, primary, municipal, or special election voting history)
* Absentee or military voter designations
* Source of voter registration, i.e., DMV/MVA, Public Assistance Office, etc.
* Ethnicity or emerges race hypothesis
* Gender
* Birth date or age range

Data that may be added via commercial routes:

* "Extreme voters" status (voters who vote very frequently)
* Homeownership
* Hunting or fishing license holders
* Boat owners
* Concealed Weapon Permit Holders
* Occupation such as physical therapist, teacher, etc.
* Charitable or political contributions
* Magazine subscription status

==Voter database management software==
The use of voter databases has been established in political campaigns from local school board to national elections:

===In the United States===
In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] in the United States, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] used the [[Voter Vault]] platform and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] used [[Demzilla|DataMart]]. Currently, the Republicans use rVotes Data Center and the Democrats use Votebuilder from the [[NGP VAN|Voter Activation Network (VAN)]]. There are non-partisan firms that offer registered voter data in the United States, too: [http://nationbuilder.com NationBuilder], [http://aristotle.com Aristotle], [http://www.eMerges.com eMerges] and [http://www.labelsandlists.com/ Labels and Lists].

In 2015, a database of 191 million U.S. voters was exposed on the internet and included names, addresses, birth dates, party affiliations, phone numbers and emails of voters in all 50 U.S. states and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Database of 191 million U.S. voters exposed on Internet: researcher| work = Reuters| accessdate = 2015-12-31| date = 2015-12-29| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-voters-breach-idUSKBN0UB1E020151229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United Kingdom===

Since the beginning of 2015 the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] has used an online database called Votesource which is a centrally held database that local activists administer. The database merges both the membership database and the electoral roll and the centralised nature of it means the party can build demographic models based on [[Mosaic (geodemography)|Mosaic]] in to it to identify voters who are more likely to support the party at an election. The system is not without criticism and faced particular problems during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 General Election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2015/06/the-computers-that-crashed-and-the-campaign-that-didnt-the-story-of-the-tory-stealth-operation-that-outwitted-labour.html |title=The computers that crashed. And the campaign that didn't. The story of the Tory stealth operation that outwitted Labour last month |publisher=Conservative Home |date=2015-06-16 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the primary to select the Conservative candidate for [[London mayoral election, 2016|2016 London Mayoral Election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2015/09/cchq-presses-on-with-the-london-mayoral-selection-while-battling-with-votesource.html |title=CCHQ presses on with the London Mayoral selection, while battling with VoteSource |publisher=Conservative Home |date=2015-09-11 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar system with a similar Mosaic-based demographic model was used by [[Britain Stronger in Europe]] during the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 EU referendum]].

From 2009 to the end of 2014 the Conservative Party used a system called MERLIN (Managing Elector Relationships through Local Information Networks) which was a national database accessible by every local Conservative Association in the country.{{fact|date=July 2017}} This was commissioned in 2005,&lt;ref name="David Cameron's battle to connect"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2010/04/features/david-camerons-battle-to-connect|title=David Cameron's battle to connect|work=Wired UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went live in 2008.&lt;ref name="Tory activists uneasy over poll software"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dd091fb6-404a-11df-8d23-00144feabdc0.html|title=Tory activists uneasy over poll software|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1990s to 2009 the Conservative Party used a programme called BlueChip which was a programme held on individual Conservative Association computers. BlueChip was not a nationally centralised database and it relied entirely on local activists maintaining it and updating it. For the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]] the party incorporated a national model called Voter Vault into the BlueChip system for the first time to direct canvassers towards voters based on demographics.

Britain's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] has used a variety of voter databases through the past two decades. Its most recent incarnation is the Labour Contact Creator system, an online tool accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. Party members and activists are provided with a username and password and voter contact details, preferences, interests, past voting behaviour, and demographic/socio-economic information are available. The system allows voters to be selected on the basis of a MOSAIC grouping, which attempts to determine the sort of interests and activities a voter or a household might display. Maps of where key voters live and information can be cross-referenced so users can find where target voters live, how often they are contacted, how they prefer to be contacted, and what responses have been provided upon making contact.

The Contact Creator system is also linked with the Labour Party's other new media tools, Print Creator and Email Creator. Print Creator allows key voters identified through Contact Creator to be targeted with direct mails and leaflets about Labour Party activity. Email Creator allows the user to collect a list of email addresses on the Contact Creator system, e-mail thousands of voters, and monitor the response rate from targets.

The Labour Party also operates 'Membersnet', which allows party members to update their registration details, inform other members and Party HQ of rival campaign activities, create events and invite others to attend, email members, create blogs, and share best practice campaign material.

The Labour Party introduced a new system to Membersnet and Contact Creator in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labourlist.org/2013/01/5-key-things-to-take-away-from-labours-target-seat-list-and-election-strategy/|title=5 key things to take away from Labour’s target seat list (and election strategy)|work=LabourList - Labour's biggest independent grassroots e-network}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on a new user-friendly interface, which allows Party Members anywhere in the UK to contact target voters and identify their voting preferences. They will then be able to enter the information gained directly into the Contact Creator system.

In late 2011 Liberal Democrats began to adopt the use of a variant of [[NGP VAN]]'s Voter Activation Network (VAN) software named "Connect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libdemvoice.org/thank-you-ears-but-the-van-is-coming-24486.html|title=Thank you EARS, but the VAN is coming|work=Liberal Democrat Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt; This firm also supplies "Votebuilder" and VAN to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in the USA and to the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] as "Liberalist".

In 2016 [[Vote Leave]] built a bespoke database called VICS (Voting Intention Collection System) which was an online database that local activists used for canvassing and Get Out the Vote operations. The VICS system was the first of its kind to incorporate a geographic street-based reactive demographic model which directed activists towards streets likely to support leaving the European Union. As canvass returns were entered into VICS the model reacted to adjust which streets were priorities so it became more accurate based on actual canvass returns rather than relying solely on demographic modelling. The VICS system was widely credited with the success of Vote Leave's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dominic Cummingss |url=https://dominiccummings.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/on-the-referendum-20-the-campaign-physics-and-data-science-vote-leaves-voter-intention-collection-system-vics-now-available-for-all/ |title=On the referendum #20: the campaign, physics and data science – Vote Leave's 'Voter Intention Collection System' (VICS) now available for all |publisher=Dominic Cummings's Blog |date=2016-10-29 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Canada===

In Canada, the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] developed their in-house software C-VOTE database, which replaced  their previous system [http://cpccims.ca Constituent Information Management System (CIMS)]. After major flaws arose in 2013 over C-VOTE (including not being able to identify undecided Voters), the Conservative Party switched back to CIMS for the 2015 election. CIMS was originally developed by the same company which produced Trackright, which the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]], used to manage voter information prior to the 2011 election, before switching to CIMS as well. It is similar to the Voter Vault software. The [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] uses their own custom database system called Populus. Previously the NDP used a system called NDP Vote. The [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] has recently introduced "[http://liberalist.ca/ Liberalist]" based on the US's Democrats' Voter Activation Network (VAN) Previously the Liberals used a system called ManagElect.&lt;ref name="the merge step"&gt;[http://stevejanke.com/archives/244292.php "The ManagElect "merge" step". Angry in the Great White North. October 22, 2007.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716135628/http://stevejanke.com/archives/244292.php |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dornan and pammett"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7IFIdomfb_IC&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;ots=juteLTQD2Q&amp;dq=managelect&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=managelect&amp;f=false|title=The Canadian General Election of 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Availability===

The availability of voter files sometimes creates a need for voter list management software as opposed to, for example, using Excel spreadsheets. Political campaigns generally have three options:

* Write-their-own software: A political campaign may choose to build their own database management system to handle their voter registration files. This may be accomplished in a spreadsheet program like [[Microsoft Excel]]. This method can be time-consuming and require a certain level of technology know-how, but may be the only option for certain campaigns.
* Desktop-based software: A variety of companies provide voter list management software for a desktop or laptop computer. Generally, this type of software is distributed on a per-computer basis and can therefore be expensive for larger campaigns. However, desktop-based software is easier to use than create-your-own and can provide many integrated, helpful solutions for political campaigns such as walking list generation, computer-based phone banking, and more.
* Internet-based software: Many companies provide online voter list management software. Internet-based software has many of the same benefits of desktop-based software, and has the additional advantage of being accessible from any computer ([[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS|Mac]], or [[Linux]]) with an Internet connection. Internet-based software helps campaigns eliminate the need for large campaign offices with central computer and phone banks.
