'''''Agora''''' ({{lang-es|Ágora}}) is a 2009 Spanish English-language [[historical drama film]] directed by [[Alejandro Amenábar]] and written by Amenábar and [[Mateo Gil]]. The [[biopic]] stars [[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Hypatia]], a female mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in late 4th-century [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]], who investigates the flaws of the [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] and the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model that challenges it. Surrounded by religious turmoil and social unrest, Hypatia struggles to save the knowledge of [[classical antiquity]] from destruction. [[Max Minghella]] co-stars as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave, and [[Oscar Isaac]] as Hypatia's student, and later prefect of Alexandria, [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]].

The story uses [[historical fiction]] to highlight the [[relationship between religion and science]] at the time amidst the [[decline of Greco-Roman polytheism]] and the [[Christianization of the Roman Empire]]. The title of the film takes its name from the ''[[agora]]'', a public gathering place in ancient Greece, similar to the Roman ''[[Forum (Roman)|forum]]''. The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira and shot on the island of [[Malta]] from March to June 2008. [[Justin Pollard]], co-author of ''The Rise and Fall of Alexandria'' (2007), was the historical adviser for the film.

''Agora'' was screened out of competition at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]] in May, and opened in Spain on October 9, 2009 becoming the highest-grossing film of the year for that country. Although the film had difficulty finding distribution, it was released country by country throughout late 2009 and early 2010. The film received a 53% overall approval rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and seven [[Goya Awards]] in Spain, including Best Original Screenplay. It was awarded the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize]] at the [[Hamptons International Film Festival]].

==Plot==
In 391 AD, [[History of Alexandria#Late Roman and Byzantine period|Alexandria]] is part of the [[Roman Empire]], and Greek philosopher [[Hypatia]] is a teacher at the [[Platonism|Platonic]] school, where future leaders are educated. Hypatia is the daughter of [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]], the director of the [[Musaeum]] of Alexandria. Hypatia, her father's [[slave]], Davus, and two of her pupils, [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]] and [[Synesius]], are immersed in the changing political and social landscape. She rejects Orestes's love as she prefers to devote herself to science. Davus assists Hypatia in her classes and is interested in science. He is also secretly in love with her.

Meanwhile, social unrest begins challenging the Roman rule of the city as Pagans and Christians come into conflict. When the Christians start defiling the statues of the pagan gods, the pagans, including Orestes and Theon, ambush the Christians. However, in the ensuing battle, the pagans unexpectedly find themselves outnumbered by a large Christian mob. Theon is gravely injured, and Hypatia and the pagans take refuge in the [[Serapeum#Alexandria|Library of the Serapeum]]. The Christian siege of the library ends when an envoy of the Roman Emperor [[Theodosius I]] declares that the pagans are pardoned, but the Christians shall be allowed to take possession of the library. Hypatia and the pagans flee while trying to save the most important [[scroll]]s before the Christians overtake the library and destroy its contents. Davus chooses to join the Christian forces. He later returns with a [[gladius]] and [[sexual assault|sexually assaults]] her, but he begins to sob and offers his sword to her. However, she removes his slave collar and tells him that he is free.

Several years later, Orestes, now converted to Christianity, is [[prefect]] of Alexandria. Hypatia continues to investigate the motions of the [[Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons#Prehistory|Sun, the Moon, the five known "wanderers" (planets)]], and the stars. Some Christians ridicule the thinking that [[spherical Earth|the Earth is a sphere]] by arguing that people far from the top would fall off the Earth. When they ask Davus what his opinion is, he avoids conflict by saying that only God knows these things.

Hypatia also investigates the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the solar system proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]] by having an object dropped from the mast of a moving ship which demonstrates that a possible motion of the Earth would not affect the motion, relative to Earth, of a falling object on Earth. However, due to [[Heliocentrism#Religious attitudes to heliocentrism|religious objections against heliocentrism]], the Christians have now forbidden Hypatia to teach at the school. The Christians and the [[Judaism|Jews]] come into violent conflict.

The leader of the Christians, [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], views Hypatia as having too much influence over Orestes and stages a public ceremony intended to force Orestes to subjugate her. Hypatia's former pupil, Synesius, now the Bishop of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], comes to her rescue as a religious authority counterweight but says he cannot help her unless she accepts Christianity; she refuses. Hypatia theorizes that the Earth orbits around the Sun in an [[elliptic orbit]], not a circular orbit, with the Sun at one of the [[focus (geometry)|foci]]. Cyril convinces a mob of Christians that Hypatia is a [[witch]], and they vow to kill her. Davus tries to run ahead to warn Hypatia, but she is captured. They strip Hypatia and are about to skin her alive until Davus persuades the mob otherwise, and they decide to [[stoning|stone]] her instead. When the mob goes outside to collect stones, Davus suffocates her to spare her the pain of being stoned and tells the mob that she fainted. Davus leaves as they begin to stone her.

==Cast==
*[[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Hypatia of Alexandria]]. Weisz was already a fan of Amenábar's work when she received the script, and was very interested in the role.&lt;ref name="Zona"&gt;{{cite web |title="Agora" entrevista Rachel Weisz |url=https://www.youtube.com/watchv=uKHGdj_NqS4&amp;feature=related |publisher=''Zona Trailer''}} See also: {{cite web |last=Fine |first=Marshall |authorlink=Marshall fine |date=2010-06-01 |title=The Rachel Weisz theorem |url=http://hollywoodandfine.com/interviews/?p=742 |publisher=hollywoodandfine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she had not heard of Hypatia before, she felt that her history was still relevant to the contemporary world: "Really, nothing has changed. I mean, we have huge technological advances and medical advances, but in terms of people killing each other in the name of God, fundamentalism still abounds. And in certain cultures, women are still second-class citizens, and they’re denied education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |date=2009-05-19 |title=Hypatia, history and a never-ending story |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/articles/2009/05/19/1242498745843.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qKVbewOE?url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2009/05/19/1242498745843.html?page=fullpage |archivedate=2010-06-08 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weisz wanted to delve more into Hypatia's sexuality and her desires, but Amenábar disagreed. She also received science lessons to help inform her depiction of the character.&lt;ref name="Zona" /&gt; At the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, Weisz spoke about her style and approach: "There's no way we could know how people behave in the 4th century. I imagine they were still human beings with the same emotions as we have now. There are cultural customs, I guess, which were different. We approach the acting style to make the people flesh and blood and to make the acting incredibly naturalistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= |title=Rachel Weisz in Cannes for Agora |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBSioB9L9dw |publisher=''Films &amp; Stars''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Max Minghella]] as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave. Davus is in love with Hypatia, but it is an [[unrequited love]], and Davus turns towards Christianity instead. When Hypatia is about to be stoned to death at the end of the film, he decides to suffocate her because he still loves her and doesn't want her to suffer any physical pain. The character of Davus was invented as "eyes for the audience" and is not based on any historical account.&lt;ref name="HolaTV"&gt;{{cite web |date=2009-10-09 |title=En primicia: Max Minghella y Oscar Isaac, estrellas de 'Ágor |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex9rss2hvBg |publisher=''HolaTV.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minghella grew up in Hampstead, near the same area of North London as Weisz, and found it very easy to work with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Agora - Max Minghella |date=2009-10-08 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ-9ngpDz8s |publisher=''Estrenos de Cine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Oscar Isaac]] as [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]]. Student of Hypatia, Orestes is an aristocrat, who like Davus, falls in love with her, and has a strong friendship with Hypatia.&lt;ref name="HolaTV" /&gt; Isaac was familiar with the history of early Christianity during the period represented in the film, but like Weisz, he had not heard of Hypatia before joining the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2009-10-08 |title=Agora - Oscar Isaac |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci13WRN2Sws |publisher=''Estrenos de Cine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sami Samir as Saint [[Cyril of Alexandria]]
*Manuel Cauchi as [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus of Alexandria]], uncle of Cyril
*[[Ashraf Barhom]] as [[Ammonius (monk)|Ammonius]], a [[parabalani]] [[monk]]
*[[Michael Lonsdale]] as [[Theon of Alexandria]], father of Hypatia
*[[Rupert Evans]] as [[Synesius|Synesius of Cyrene]]
*[[Homayoun Ershadi]] as Aspasius the old slave. He acts as Hypatia's [[research assistant]].

===Development===
{{rquote|right|''It's a movie that challenges the audience in terms of reasoning and trying to get into the story. I kept saying the movie is about astronomy and I wanted to express concepts that we study in school—science, mathematics—that don’t show how fascinating the topic is [the way the subjects are taught in modern education]. I wanted to translate [man’s] fascination with the pursuit of knowledge. I wanted to show astronomy and those who study it in the most appealing way. Those are the real heroes of the movie.''|Alejandro Amenábar&lt;ref name="Holleran"&gt;{{cite news|last=Holleran |first=Scott |date=2010-05-30 |title=Interview: Alejandro Amenabar on Agora |url=http://www.scottholleran.com/interviews/alejandro-amenabar.htm |publisher=scottholleran.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qKVt2Mdc?url=http://www.scottholleran.com/interviews/alejandro-amenabar.htm |archivedate=2010-06-08 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After Amenábar completed ''[[The Sea Inside]]'' (2004), he took a break and traveled to the island of Malta, where he used his free time to [[Amateur astronomy|explore the night sky]]. Seeing the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, Amenábar began to discuss astronomy with his friends, speculating about [[extraterrestrial life]] on [[extrasolar planet|other planets]]. He started to research astronomy and came across ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', by American astronomer [[Carl Sagan]].&lt;ref name="Billington"&gt;{{cite news |last=Billington |first=Alex |date=2009-05-26 |title=Cannes Interview: Agora Director Alejandro Amenábar |url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2009/05/26/cannes-interview-agora-director-alejandro-amenabar/ |publisher=''First Showing''}} See also: {{cite news |last=Saavedra |first=Mikhail |date=2009-09-18 |title=Alternavox at TIFF: In Conversation with…Alejandro Amenábar |url=http://alternavox.net/boxoffice/alternavox-at-tiff-in-conversation-withalejandro-amenabar/ |publisher=''Alternavox.net''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amenábar also studied historical figures such as [[Ptolemy]], [[Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but found himself most interested in the story of [[Hypatia]], a 4th-century Greek astronomer whose history, he felt, was still relevant in the 21st century: "We realized that this particular time in the world had a lot of connections with our contemporary reality. Then the project became really, really intriguing, because we realized that we could make a movie about the past while actually making a movie about the present."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Germain |first=David |date=2009-05-17 |title=Weisz, Amenabar preach enlightenment with 'Agora' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8512013 |publisher=''[[guardian.co.uk]]'' |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare for the task of recreating the ancient city of Alexandria without relying on computer generated imagery, Amenábar reviewed older [[sword-and-sandal]] films such as ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), and ''[[Pharaoh (film)|Pharaoh]]'' (1966).&lt;ref name="Billington" /&gt; A year before the start of pre-production, designer [[Guy Hendrix Dyas]] spent three weeks with Amenábar in Madrid to do some preliminary work on the set designs and the recreation of the ancient city of Alexandria so that previs animations could be generated.

The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira, with Telecinco Cinema as the primary producer along with Mod Producciones, Himenoptero, and [[Sogecable]] as co-producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2008-03-13 |title=Agora Starts Shooting Stars |url=http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=73034 |publisher=4RFV.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
{{rquote|right|''A visually imposing, high-minded epic that ambitiously puts one of the pivotal moments in Western history onscreen for the first time.''|Todd McCarthy, ''Variety''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |date=2009-05-25 |title=Agora |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] |url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=review&amp;reviewid=VE1117940282&amp;cs=1 |volume= |issue=|issn= |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

British writer and film critic [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised Alejandro Amenábar and his film, describing ''Agora'' as "an ambitious, cerebral and complex movie.... Unlike most toga movies, it doesn't rely on CGI spectacle, but real drama and ideas." Bradshaw also applauded Rachel Weisz's role as Hypatia, calling it "an outstanding performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bradshaw |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Bradshaw |date=2010-04-22 |title=Agora |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/22/agora-review |publisher=''[[guardian.co.uk]]'' |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
American screenwriter and critic [[Roger Ebert]] liked the film and gave it three stars out of four. He said: "I went to see ''Agora'' expecting an epic with swords, sandals and sex. I found swords and sandals, some unexpected opinions about sex, and a great deal more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100721/REVIEWS/100729996/0/SCANNERS|title='Agora' review by Roger Ebert | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film holds a 52% 'Rotten' rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 87 reviews.&lt;ref name="rt" /&gt;

===Response from Christians===
Before its release, the distribution company insisted on screening the film at the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. No objections were reported and Vatican officials assisted in some of the religious depictions. According to Amenábar, "There’s one scene in which Cyril reads from [[Pauline Epistles|St. Paul]] and [the Vatican] tried to look for the softest version. In the English version, [it is] taken from the [[Authorized King James Version|King James version]] of the [[Bible]]."&lt;ref name="Holleran"/&gt; The line is excerpted from {{bibleverse|1 Timothy|2:8-2:12|9}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy%202:8-2:12&amp;version=KJV The film uses a partial paraphrase of 1 Timothy 2:8 - 2:12, King James Version]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Religious Anti-Defamation Observatory (Observatorio Antidifamación Religiosa), a [[Christianity in Spain|Spanish Catholic]] group, claimed that the film was responsible for "promoting [[anti-Christian sentiment|hatred of Christians]] and reinforcing false clichés about the Catholic Church."&lt;ref name="cna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/civil_groups_protest_new_antichristian_film|title=Civil groups protest new anti-Christian film |publisher=[[Catholic News Agency]]}} See also: [http://www.oadir.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=33 Observatorio Antidifamación Religiosa]&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Ordoña of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' acknowledges that the film has been criticized for "perceived slights against Christians" but that "its lack of condemnation of specific dogma makes the film's target seem to be fundamentalism in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ordoña |first=Michael |date=2010-06-04 |title=Movie review: 'Agora' shows the true casualty of war|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/04/entertainment/la-et-capsules-20100604|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the New York-based Rev. Philip Grey wrote a positive review of the film and strongly recommended it: "Christians who see themselves in the fanatic, murderous monks of the film and feel offended need to do some serious soul-searching.(...) Hypatia as depicted in the film is firmly opposed to what, in her time and at her city, is offered&amp;mdash;or rather, imposed by brute force&amp;mdash;under the name of 'Christianity'. Nevertheless, she seems to me far more a follower of the precepts of Christianity than are her persecutors and tormentors.(...) In particular, in watching the deeply moving final scene, her going calmly to her death amidst the jeering mob, I could not help but strongly recall Jesus Christ on his own way to Golgotha".&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Philip B. Grey, "Real and perceived Christianity in today's mass media and popular culture" in 'Positive Christianity Review', Summer 2010 issue, p. 26,29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
''Agora'' was [[cinema of Spain|Spain's highest-grossing film]] of 2009, earning over $10.3 million within four days of its release on October 9.&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/agora/ |title=Agora |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=October 20, 2012| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091012232946/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/agora/| archivedate= 12 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on North American theatre tracking data from [[Rentrak|Rentrak Theatrical]], ''[[indieWIRE]]'' reported that ''Agora'' "scored the highest per-theater-average of any film in the marketplace" during the [[Memorial Day]] holiday weekend from May 28 through May 31, just after its U.S. [[limited release]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Knegt |first=Peter |date=2010-06-01 |title=Holiday Box Office: "Agora," "Micmacs" Post Decent Debuts; Restored "Breathless" Scores (UPDATED) |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/2010/06/01/holiday_box_office_agora_micmacs_post_decent_debuts_restored_breathless_sco/ |publisher=''[[indieWire]]''}} For hard data see: {{cite news |last=Klady |first=Leonard |date=2010-05-31 |title=True Grit: The Sands of Tommy |url=http://moviecitynews.com/columnists/klady/2010/100531.html |work=The Weekend Report |publisher=''Movie City News''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this very high per-theater average, ''Agora'' was never widely released in the United States. According to [[Box Office Mojo]], its widest release in the United States was just 17 theaters.&lt;ref&gt;http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=agora.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The film grossed over $32.3 million (€21.4 million) by 1 December 2009, and about $35 million by 1 February 2010. As of 10 January 2011, ''Agora'''s worldwide box office earnings were approximately $39 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=agora.htm |title=Agora (2010) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVD and Blu-ray sales numbers are not publicly available.

===Accolades===
''Agora'' was nominated for 13 [[Goya Awards]], winning 7.&lt;ref name="Olsen" /&gt; The film won the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize]] ($25,000 USD) in 2009 at the [[Hamptons International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hamptons Online|url=http://www.hamptons.com/The-Arts/Hamptons-International-Film-Festival/9133/HIFF-And-Alfred-P.-Sloan-Foundation-Celebrate-Ten.html|title=HIFF And Alfred P.

==Historical accuracy==
[[File:Cricau Festival 2013 - Lorica squamata - 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|By the fifth century AD, when the film is set, Roman soldiers wore either [[Lorica squamata|scale armor]] (pictured) or [[Lorica hamata|chain mail]], not leather armor as they are shown wearing in the film.&lt;ref name="O'Neil"/&gt;]]

{{ill|Antonio Mampaso|es}}, a Spanish astrophysicist and one of ''Agora'''s scientific advisors, stated in an interview that "We know that Hypatia lived in Alexandria in the IV and V centuries CE, until her death in 415. Only three primary sources mention Hypatia of Alexandria, apart from other secondary ones". He added that none of Hypatia's work has survived but it is thought, from secondary sources, that her main fields of study and work were geometry and astronomy. Mampaso claimed that Hypatia invented the [[hydrometer]], an instrument still in use today, and that probably her father [[Theon of Alexandria]], together with Hypatia, invented the [[astrolabe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sacristán|first=Enrique|date=2009-10-28|url=http://www.oei.es/divulgacioncientifica/entrevistas_034.htm|title=Antonio Mampaso: 'El mejor legado de Hipatia es su propia historia'|work=Servicio de Información y Noticias Científicas (SINC)|publisher=''[[Organization of Ibero-American States]]'' (OEI) }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is generally accepted that the astrolabe had already been invented a couple of centuries earlier, and that the instrument was known to the Greeks before the Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;'It is generally accepted that Greek astrologers, in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE, invented the astrolabe', Krebs, 'Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance', p. 196 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The invention of the astrolabe is usually attributed to Hipparchus of the second century BC. But there is no firm evidence to support this view. It is however certain that the instrument was well known to the Greeks before the beginning of the Christian era.', Sarma, ‘The Archaic and the Exotic: studies in the history of Indian astronomical instruments’, p. 241 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the hydrometer was invented before Hypatia, and already known in her time. In this regard, [[Pappus of Alexandria]] was recorded as using the hydrometer before Hypatia was even born. [[Synesius]] sent Hypatia a letter describing a hydrometer, and requesting her to have one constructed for him.&lt;ref&gt;"Ep. 15 is rather short, but gives interesting information: it contains a detailed description of a hydroscope which Synesius asks Hypatia to order for him in Alexandria, requesting that she herself oversee its construction.", Kari Vogt, "The Hierophant of Philosophy" - Hypatia of Alexandria, Kari Elisabeth Boerresen and Kari Vogt, Women's studies of the Christian and Islamic traditions: ancient, medieval, and Renaissance foremothers, p. 161 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'For the sake of completeness we must mention that fact that SYNESIOS in his letter to HYPATIA mentions a hydrometer, which according to some was already known in the fourth century AD to PRISCIANUS, that is a century before SYNESIOS and HYPATIA.', Forbes, 'A Short History of the Art of Distillation: from the beginnings up to the death of Cellier Blumenthal', p. 25 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'In 402, Hypatia receives a letter from the ailing Synesius giving a brief description of what he calls a hydroscope. This is a scientific instrument which was then in common use, although Hypatian is often credited with its invention.', Waithe, 'Ancient women philosophers, 600 B.C.-500 A.D.', p. 192 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that the historical Hypatia ever studied the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]]&lt;ref name="O'Neil"/&gt; or that she ever found any evidence to support it.&lt;ref name="Theodore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Neil"/&gt;

The set used in the film is meticulously historically authentic,&lt;ref name="O'Neil"/&gt; showing a blend of Greek, Roman, and Egyptian architectural styles that would have been fitting to the time period,&lt;ref name="O'Neil"/&gt; but the costumes are anachronistic.&lt;ref name="O'Neil"/&gt; The Roman soldiers are shown wearing generic armor and weapons resembling the type used in the first century AD,&lt;ref name="O'Neil"/&gt; but the film is actually set in the fifth century AD, by which time Roman troops no longer wore leather armor&lt;ref name="O'Neil"/&gt; and would have instead worn [[Lorica squamata|scale armor]] or [[Lorica hamata|chain mail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kelly &amp; Robert Douglas Smith|last=DeVries|title=Medieval Weapons: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2007|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jdcrsCOB-VcC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Lorica%20squamata&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q=Lorica%20squamata&amp;f=false 24–27]|isbn=9781851095261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rubens.anu.edu.au/raid1/student_projects97/armour/scale/scale.html|title=Scale (Lorica Squamata)|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Barron (priest)|Robert Barron]], an American Catholic priest, writes in an article: "Hypatia was indeed a philosopher and she was indeed killed by a mob in 415, but practically everything else about the story that Gibbon and Sagan and Amenábar tell is false".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barron |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Barron (priest) |date=2010-05-09| url=http://www.catholicnewworld.com/cnwonline/2010/0509/barron.aspx |title=Christians must resist dangerous silliness of ‘Agora’|work=[[Catholic New World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irene A. Artemi, a doctor of theology at Athens University, states that "The movie—albeit seemingly not turning against the Christian religion—is in fact portraying the Christians as fundamentalist, obscurantist, ignorant and fanatic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Artemi|first=Irene A.|date=2010-02-12|url=http://www.impantokratoros.gr/D3C02F38.en.aspx|title=The historical inaccuracies of the movie "AGORA" by Alejandro Amenabar|publisher=''Orthodoxos Typos''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the atheist historian Tim O'Neil remarks: "Over and over again, elements are added to the story that are not in the source material: the destruction of the library, the stoning of the Jews in the theatre, Cyril condemning Hypatia's teaching because she is a woman, the heliocentric "breakthrough" and Hypatia's supposed irreligiosity."&lt;ref name="O'Neil"/&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2015}}
'''Alexander Rosenberg''' (born 1946) is an American philosopher, and the R. Taylor Cole Professor of Philosophy at [[Duke University]]. He is also a novelist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Krakow-Novel-Alex-Rosenberg/dp/1477830812/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436875168&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+girl+from+krakow&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Rosenberg attended the [[City College of New York]] where he graduated with a B.A. in 1967. He received his Ph.D. from the [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1971. He won the [[Lakatos Award]] in 1993 and was the National [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Romanell Lecturer in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.duke.edu/~alexrose/RosenbergCV.pdf |title=Archived item |accessdate=2013-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002191946/http://people.duke.edu/~alexrose/RosenbergCV.pdf |archivedate=October 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg is an [[atheist]], and a [[metaphysical naturalism|metaphysical naturalist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/why-i-am-a-naturalist/|title=Why I Am a Naturalist|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/bodies-in-motion-an-exchange/|title=Bodies in Motion: An Exchange|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and scholarship==
Rosenberg's early work focused on the [[philosophy of social science]] and especially the [[philosophy of economics]]. His doctoral dissertation, published as ''Microeconomic Laws'' in 1976, was the first treatment of the nature of economics by a contemporary philosopher of science. Over the period of the next decade he became increasingly skeptical about [[neoclassical economics]] as an empirical theory.

He later shifted to work on issues in the [[philosophy of science]] that are raised by biology. He became especially interested in the relationship between molecular biology and other parts of biology. Rosenberg introduced the concept of [[supervenience]] to the treatment of intertheoretical relations in biology, soon after [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] began to exploit [[R. M. Hare|Richard Hare]]'s notion in the philosophy of psychology. Rosenberg is among the few biologists and fewer philosophers of science who reject the consensus view that combines [[physicalism]] with [[antireductionism]] (see his 2010 on-line debate with [[John Dupré]] at [[Philosophy TV]]).

Rosenberg also coauthored an influential book on [[David Hume]] with [[Tom Beauchamp]], ''[[Hume and the Problem of Causation]]'', arguing that Hume was not a skeptic about induction but an opponent of rationalist theories of inductive inference.

==Critical discussions of Rosenberg’s work==
Rosenberg’s treatment of fitness as a supervenient property, which is an undefined concept in the theory of natural selection, is criticized by Brandon and Beatty.&lt;ref&gt;in “The Propensity Interpretation of 'Fitness'--No Interpretation Is No Substitute,” ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 51, No. 2, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; His original development of how the [[supervenience]] of Mendelian concepts blocks traditional derivational reduction was examined critically by [[C. Kenneth Waters]].&lt;ref&gt;in “Rosenberg's rebellion”, ''Biology and Philosophy'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; His later account of reduction in developmental biology was criticized by [[Günter Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;“How Molecular is Molecular Developmental Biology? A Reply to Alex Rosenberg's Reductionism Redux: Computing the Embryo”, ''Biology and Philosophy'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elliott Sober]]'s "Multiple realization arguments against reductionism"&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy of Science'', vol. 66, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; reflects a shift towards Rosenberg's critique of anti-reductionist arguments of [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]]'s and [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]]'s.

Sober has also challenged Rosenberg’s view that the principle of natural selection is the only biological law.&lt;ref&gt;in “Two Outbreaks of Lawlessness in Recent Philosophy of Biology,” ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 64, No. 4, 1996 as did [[Kim Sterelny]] and [[Paul E. Griffiths]], ''Sex and Death''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The explanatory role of the principle of natural selection and the nature of evolutionary probabilities defended by Rosenberg were subject to counter arguments by Brandon&lt;ref&gt;in “The Indeterministic Character of Evolutionary Theory: No "No Hidden Variables Proof" but No Room for Determinism Either” ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 63, No. 3 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and later by Denis Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;“The Pomp of Superfluous Causes: The Interpretation of Evolutionary Theory”, ''Philosophy of Science'' Vol. 74, No. 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg's account of the nature of [[genetic drift]] and the role of probability in the theory of natural selection draws on significant parallels between the principle of natural selection and the second law of thermodynamics.

In the philosophy of social science, Rosenberg’s more skeptical views about [[microeconomics]] were challenged first by Wade Hands&lt;ref&gt;in “What Economics Is Not: An Economist's Response to Rosenberg”, ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 51, No. 3 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and later by Daniel Hausman in several books and articles.&lt;ref&gt;including “Economic Methodology in a Nutshell," ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', Vol. 3, No. 2 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial crisis of 2008–09 resulted in renewed attention to Rosenberg's skeptical views about [[microeconomics]]. Biologist [[Richard Lewontin]] and historian Joseph Fracchia express skepticism about Rosenberg’s claim that functional explanations in social science require Darwinian underlying mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;“Does Culture Evolve?” ''History and Theory'' 38 (4), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Atheist's Guide to Reality''==
In 2011 Rosenberg published a defense of what he called "[[Scientism]]"—the claim that "the persistent questions" people ask about the nature of reality, the purpose of things, the foundations of value and morality, the way the mind works, the basis of personal identity, and the course of human history, could all be answered by the resources of science. This book was attacked on the front cover of [[The New Republic]] by [[Leon Wieseltier]] as "The worst book of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/washington-diarist/magazine/98566/science-atheism-meaning-life#.|title=Leon Wieseltier: The Answers – The New Republic|author=Leon Wieseltier|work=The New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wieseltier|Leon Wiseltier]]'s claim, in turn, was critiqued as exaggeration by [[Philip Kitcher]] in [[The New York Times Book Review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/alex-rosenbergs-the-atheists-guide-to-reality.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Philip | last=Kitcher | title=Alex Rosenberg's 'The Atheist's Guide to Reality' | date=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, 2013, Rosenberg debated Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] over the topics discussed in ''The Atheist's Guide to Reality.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symposiachristi.com/debate/ |title=Is Faith in God Reasonable? |website=Symposia Christi |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg has contributed articles to ''[[The New York Times]]'' Op/Ed series [[The Stone (blog)|The Stone]], on naturalism, science and the humanities, and meta-ethics, and the mind's powers to understand itself by introspection that arise from the views he advanced in ''The Atheist's Guide to Reality.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/why-i-am-a-naturalist/|title=Why I Am a Naturalist|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/bodies-in-motion-an-exchange/|title=Bodies in Motion: An Exchange|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/|title=Can Moral Disputes be Resolved|author=Alexander Rosenberg|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/opinion/why-you-dont-know-your-own-mind|author=Alexander Rosenberg|publisher=”[[The New York Times]]”|date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Girl From Krakow''==
Rosenberg’s 2015 novel, ''The Girl From Krakow'', Lake Union Publishing, is a narrative about a young woman named Rita Feuerstahl from 1935 to 1947, mainly focusing on her struggles to survive in Nazi-occupied Poland and later in Germany, under a false identity. A secondary plot involves her lover’s experiences in France and Spain during its Civil War in the 1930s and then in Moscow during the war. Rosenberg has acknowledged that the novel is based on the wartime experiences of people he knew. He has also admitted the incongruity of writing a narrative, given his attack on the form in ''The Atheist’s Guide to Reality''. He has said that ''The Girl from Krakow'' began as an attempt to put some of the difficult arguments of ''The Atheist’s Guide to Reality'' into a form easier to grasp".&lt;ref&gt;Ognian Georgiev (August 8, 2015). [http://landofbooks.org/2015/08/08/alex-rosenberg-the-girl-from-krakow-is-based-on-people-who-survived-the-war "Alex Rosenberg: ''The Girl from Krakow'' is based on people who survived the war"], ''Land of Books''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Girl From Krakow'' has been translated into Italian, Hungarian, Polish and Hebrew.

==''Autumn in Oxford''==
In 2016 Rosenberg’s second novel, ''Autumn in Oxford'', appeared, also published by Lake Union Publishing. An afterword identifies the large number of real persons—academics, civil rights advocates, military officers, politicians and intelligence agents from the 1940s and '50s who figure in the narrative.

==''How History Gets Things Wrong: The Neuroscience of our Addiction to Stories''==
In 2018 Rosenberg published ’‘How History Gets Things Wrong: The Neuroscience of our Addiction to Stories’‘ This work develops the eliminative materialism of ‘‘The Atheist’s guide to Reality‘‘ applying it to the role ‘the theory of mind’ plays in history and other forms of story telling.  Rosenberg argues that the work of [[Nobel Prize]] winners, [[Eric Kandel]], [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] and [[May-Britt Moser]] along with [[Edvard Moser]] reveals that the ‘‘theory of mind‘‘ employed in every day life and narrative history has no basis in the organization of the brain. Evidence from evolutionary anthropology, child psychology, medical diagnosis and neural imaging reveals it is an innate or almost innate tool that arose in [[Hominini]] evolution to foster collaboration among small numbers of individuals in immediate contact over the near future, but whose predictive weakness beyond this domain reveals its explanatory emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Samira Shackle (October 19, 2018).[https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5371/can-we-learn-from-history"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37065">The '''analytic–synthetic distinction''' (also called the '''analytic–synthetic dichotomy''') is a [[Semantics|semantic]] distinction, used primarily in [[philosophy]] to distinguish propositions (in particular, statements that are affirmative subject–predicate judgments) into two types: '''analytic propositions''' and '''synthetic propositions'''. Analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.&lt;ref name=Rey/&gt; However, philosophers have used the terms in very different ways. Furthermore, philosophers have debated whether there is a legitimate distinction.

==Kant==
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]

===Conceptual containment===
The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] uses the terms "analytic" and "synthetic" to divide propositions into two types. Kant introduces the analytic–synthetic distinction in the Introduction to his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781/1998, A6–7/B10–11). There, he restricts his attention to statements that are affirmative [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]-[[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] judgments and defines "analytic proposition" and "synthetic proposition" as follows:
* '''analytic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is contained in its subject concept
* '''synthetic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is '''not''' contained in its subject concept but related

Examples of analytic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:
* "All bachelors are unmarried."
* "All triangles have three sides."

Kant's own example is:
* "All bodies are extended," that is, occupy space. (A7/B11)

Each of these statements is an affirmative subject-predicate judgment, and, in each, the predicate concept is ''contained'' within the subject concept. The concept "bachelor" contains the concept "unmarried"; the concept "unmarried" is part of the definition of the concept "bachelor". Likewise, for "triangle" and "has three sides", and so on.

Examples of synthetic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:
* "All bachelors are alone."
* "All creatures with hearts have kidneys."

Kant's own example is:
* "All bodies are heavy", that is, they experience a gravitational force. (A7/B11)

As with the previous examples classified as analytic propositions, each of these new statements is an affirmative subject–predicate judgment. However, in none of these cases does the subject concept contain the predicate concept. The concept "bachelor" does not contain the concept "alone"; "alone" is not a part of the ''definition'' of "bachelor". The same is true for "creatures with hearts" and "have kidneys"; even if every creature with a heart also has kidneys, the concept "creature with a heart" does not contain the concept "has kidneys".

===Kant's version and the ''a priori''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;''a posteriori'' distinction===
{{main|A priori and a posteriori}}
In the Introduction to the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', Kant contrasts his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions with another distinction, the distinction between [[a priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] and [[Empirical evidence|''a posteriori'']] propositions. He defines these terms as follows:
* '''''a priori''''' '''proposition''': a proposition whose justification does ''not'' rely upon experience. Moreover, the proposition can be validated by experience, but is not grounded in experience. Therefore, it is logically necessary.
* '''''a posteriori''''' '''proposition''': a proposition whose justification does rely upon experience. The proposition is validated by, and grounded in, experience. Therefore, it is logically contingent.

Examples of ''a priori'' propositions include:
* "All bachelors are unmarried."
* "7 + 5 = 12."

The justification of these propositions does not depend upon experience: one need not consult experience to determine whether all bachelors are unmarried, nor whether {{nowrap|1=7 + 5 = 12}}. (Of course, as Kant would grant, experience is required to understand the concepts "bachelor", "unmarried", "7", "+" and so forth. However, the ''a priori'' / ''a posteriori'' distinction as employed here by Kant refers not to the ''origins'' of the concepts but to the ''justification'' of the propositions. Once we have the concepts, experience is no longer necessary.)

Examples of ''a posteriori'' propositions include:
* "All bachelors are unhappy."
* "Tables exist."

Both of these propositions are ''a posteriori'': any justification of them would require one's experience.

The analytic/synthetic distinction and the ''a priori'' / ''a posteriori'' distinction together yield four types of propositions:
# analytic ''a priori''
# synthetic ''a priori''
# analytic ''a posteriori''
# synthetic ''a posteriori''

Kant posits the third type as obviously self-contradictory.  Ruling it out, he discusses only the remaining three types as components of his epistemological framework{{mdash}}each, for brevity's sake, becoming, respectively, "analytic", "synthetic a priori", and "empirical" or "a posteriori" propositions. This triad will account for all propositions possible.

===The ease of knowing analytic propositions===
Part of Kant's argument in the Introduction to the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' involves arguing that there is no problem figuring out how knowledge of analytic propositions is possible. To know an analytic proposition, Kant argued, one need not consult experience. Instead, one needs merely to take the subject and "extract from it, in accordance with the principle of contradiction, the required predicate" (A7/B12). In analytic propositions, the predicate concept is contained in the subject concept. Thus, to know an analytic proposition is true, one need merely examine the concept of the subject. If one finds the predicate contained in the subject, the judgment is true.

Thus, for example, one need not consult experience to determine whether "All bachelors are unmarried" is true. One need merely examine the subject concept ("bachelors") and see if the predicate concept "unmarried" is contained in it. And in fact, it is: "unmarried" is part of the definition of "bachelor" and so is contained within it. Thus the proposition "All bachelors are unmarried" can be known to be true without consulting experience.

It follows from this, Kant argued, first: All analytic propositions are ''a priori''; there are no ''a posteriori'' analytic propositions. It follows, second: There is no problem understanding how we can know analytic propositions;  we can know them because we only need to consult our concepts in order to determine that they are true.

===The possibility of metaphysics===
After ruling out the possibility of analytic ''a posteriori'' propositions, and explaining how we can obtain knowledge of analytic ''a priori'' propositions, Kant also explains how we can obtain knowledge of synthetic ''a posteriori'' propositions. That leaves only the question of how knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions is possible. This question is exceedingly important, Kant maintains, because all important metaphysical knowledge is of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions. If it is impossible to determine which synthetic ''a priori'' propositions are true, he argues, then metaphysics as a discipline is impossible. The remainder of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' is devoted to examining whether and how knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions is possible.&lt;ref name=Langford1949&gt; See [[Cooper Harold Langford]] (1949)'s ostensive proof: {{cite journal|title= A Proof That Synthetic A Priori Propositions Exist|journal= The Journal of Philosophy|year= 1949 |volume= 46|number= 1| date= 1949-01-06|pages= 20–24 |jstor=2019526 |last1= Langford|first1= C.

===Frege and Carnap revise the Kantian definition===
Over a hundred years later, a group of philosophers took interest in Kant and his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions: the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]].

Part of Kant's examination of the possibility of synthetic ''a priori'' knowledge involved the examination of mathematical propositions, such as
* "7 + 5 = 12." (B15–16)
* "The shortest distance between two points is a straight line." (B16–17)

Kant maintained that mathematical propositions such as these are synthetic ''a priori'' propositions, and that we know them. That they are synthetic, he thought, is obvious: the concept "equal to 12" is not contained within the concept "7 + 5";  and the concept "straight line" is not contained within the concept "the shortest distance between two points". From this, Kant concluded that we have knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions.

[[Gottlob Frege]]'s notion of analyticity included a number of logical properties and relations beyond containment: [[symmetry]], [[transitive relation|transitivity]], [[antonymy]], or [[negation]] and so on. He had a strong emphasis on formality, in particular formal definition, and also emphasized the idea of substitution of synonymous terms. "All bachelors are unmarried" can be expanded out with the formal definition of bachelor as "unmarried man" to form "All unmarried men are unmarried", which is recognizable as tautologous and therefore analytic from its logical form: any statement of the form "All ''X'' that are (''F'' and ''G'') are ''F''". Using this particular expanded idea of analyticity, Frege concluded that Kant's examples of arithmetical truths are analytical ''a priori'' truths and ''not'' synthetic ''a priori'' truths.

{{quote|1=Thanks to Frege's logical semantics, particularly his concept of analyticity, arithmetic truths like "7+5=12" are no longer synthetic ''a priori'' but analytical ''a priori'' truths in [[Carnap]]'s extended sense of "analytic".
Hence logical empiricists are not subject to Kant's criticism of Hume for throwing out mathematics along with metaphysics.&lt;ref name=Katz/&gt;}}

(Here "logical empiricist" is a synonym for "logical positivist".)

===The origin of the logical positivist's distinction===
The logical positivists agreed with Kant that we have knowledge of mathematical truths, and further that mathematical propositions are ''a priori''. However, they did not believe that any complex metaphysics, such as the type Kant supplied, are necessary to explain our knowledge of mathematical truths. Instead, the logical positivists maintained that our knowledge of judgments like "all bachelors are unmarried" and our knowledge of mathematics (and logic) are in the basic sense the same: all proceeded from our knowledge of the meanings of terms or the conventions of language.

{{quote|Since empiricism had always asserted that ''all'' knowledge is based on experience, this assertion had to include knowledge in mathematics. On the other hand, we believed that with respect to this problem the rationalists had been right in rejecting the old empiricist view that the truth of "&lt;nowiki&gt;2+2=4&lt;/nowiki&gt;" is contingent on the observation of facts, a view that would lead to the unacceptable consequence that an arithmetical statement might possibly be refuted tomorrow by new experiences. Our solution, based upon [[Wittgenstein]]'s conception, consisted in asserting the thesis of empiricism only for factual truth. By contrast, the truths of logic and mathematics are not in need of confirmation by observations, because they do not state anything about the world of facts, they hold for any possible combination of facts.&lt;ref name=Schlipp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;|Rudolf Carnap|Autobiography: §10: Semantics, p. 64}}

===Logical positivist definitions===
Thus the logical positivists drew a new distinction, and, inheriting the terms from Kant, named it the "analytic/synthetic distinction".&lt;ref name=Ebbs/&gt; They provided many different definitions, such as the following:
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition whose truth depends solely on the meaning of its terms
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition that is true (or false) by definition
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition that is made true (or false) solely by the conventions of language

(While the logical positivists believed that the only necessarily true propositions were analytic, they did not define "analytic proposition" as "necessarily true proposition" or "proposition that is true in all possible worlds".)

Synthetic propositions were then defined as:
* '''synthetic proposition''': a proposition that is not analytic

These definitions applied to all propositions, regardless of whether they were of subject–predicate form. Thus, under these definitions, the proposition "It is raining or it is not raining" was classified as analytic, while for Kant it was analytic by virtue of its logical form. And the proposition "{{nowrap|1=7 + 5 = 12}}" was classified as analytic, while under Kant's definitions it was synthetic.

==Two-dimensionalism==
[[Two-dimensionalism]] is an approach to [[semantics]] in [[analytic philosophy]]. It is a theory of how to determine the [[sense and reference]] of a [[word]] and the [[truth-value]] of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. It is intended to resolve a puzzle that has plagued philosophy for some time, namely: How is it possible to discover empirically that a [[necessary truth]] is [[Truth|true]]? Two-dimensionalism provides an analysis of the semantics of words and sentences that makes sense of this possibility. The theory was first developed by [[Robert Stalnaker]], but it has been advocated by numerous philosophers since, including [[David Chalmers]] and [[Berit Brogaard]].

Any given sentence, for example, the words,
:"Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O"

is taken to express two distinct [[proposition]]s, often referred to as a ''primary intension'' and a ''secondary intension'', which together compose its [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].&lt;ref name=Chalmers/&gt;

The primary [[intension]] of a word or sentence is its [[sense and reference|sense]], i.e., is the idea or method by which we find its referent. The primary intension of "water" might be a description, such as ''watery stuff''. The thing picked out by the primary intension of "water" could have been otherwise. For example, on some other world where the inhabitants take "water" to mean ''watery stuff'', but, where the chemical make-up of watery stuff is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, it is not the case that water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O for that world.

The ''secondary intension'' of "water" is whatever thing "water" happens to pick out in ''this'' world, whatever that world happens to be. So if we assign "water" the primary intension ''watery stuff'' then the secondary intension of "water" is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, since H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is ''watery stuff'' in this world. The secondary intension of "water" in our world is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in every world because unlike ''watery stuff'' it is impossible for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to be other than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. When considered according to its secondary intension, "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is true in every world.

If two-dimensionalism is workable it solves some very important problems in the philosophy of language. [[Saul Kripke]] has argued that "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is an example of the ''[[necessary truth|necessary]] [[a posteriori]]'', since we had to discover that water was H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but given that it is true, it cannot be false. It would be absurd to claim that something that is water is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, for these are known to be ''identical''.

==Quine's criticisms==
{{See also|Willard Van Orman Quine#Rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction|Two Dogmas of Empiricism#Analyticity and circularity}}
[[Rudolf Carnap]] was a strong proponent of the distinction between what he called "internal questions", questions entertained within a "framework" (like a mathematical theory), and "external questions", questions posed outside any framework&amp;nbsp;– posed before the adoption of any framework.&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Murzi/&gt; The "internal" questions could be of two types: ''logical'' (or analytic, or logically true) and ''factual'' (empirical, that is, matters of observation interpreted using terms from a framework). The "external" questions were also of two types: those that were confused pseudo-questions ("one disguised in the form of a theoretical question") and those that could be re-interpreted as practical, pragmatic questions about whether a framework under consideration was "more or less expedient, fruitful, conducive to the aim for which the language is intended".&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt; The adjective "synthetic" was not used by Carnap in his 1950 work ''Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology''.&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt; Carnap did define a "synthetic truth" in his work ''[[Meaning and Necessity]]'': a sentence that is true, but not simply because "the semantical rules of the system suffice for establishing its truth".&lt;ref name=Carnap2/&gt;

The notion of a synthetic truth is of something that is true both because of what it means and because of the way the world is, whereas analytic truths are true in virtue of meaning alone. Thus, what Carnap calls internal ''factual'' statements (as opposed to internal ''logical'' statements) could be taken as being also synthetic truths because they require ''observations'', but some external statements also could be "synthetic" statements and Carnap would be doubtful about their status. The analytic–synthetic argument therefore is not identical with the [[internal–external distinction]].&lt;ref name=Yablo/&gt;

In 1951, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] published the essay "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" in which he argued that the analytic–synthetic distinction is untenable.&lt;ref name=Dogmas/&gt; The argument at bottom is that there are no "analytic" truths, but all truths involve an empirical aspect. In the first paragraph, Quine takes the distinction to be the following:
* analytic propositions&amp;nbsp;– propositions grounded in meanings, independent of matters of fact.
* synthetic propositions&amp;nbsp;– propositions grounded in fact.

Quine's position denying the analytic-synthetic distinction is summarized as follows:
{{quote|It is obvious that truth in general depends on both language and extralinguistic fact. ... Thus one is tempted to suppose in general that the truth of a statement is somehow analyzable into a linguistic component and a factual component. Given this supposition, it next seems reasonable that in some statements the factual component should be null; and these are the analytic statements. But, for all its ''a priori'' reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith.&lt;ref name=Quine4/&gt;|Willard v. O. Quine|"Two Dogmas of Empiricism", p. 64}}

To summarize Quine's argument, the notion of an analytic proposition requires a notion of synonymy, but establishing synonymy inevitably leads to matters of fact&amp;nbsp;– synthetic propositions. Thus, there is no non-circular (and so no tenable) way to ground the notion of analytic propositions.

While Quine's rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction is widely known, the precise argument for the rejection and its status is highly debated in contemporary philosophy. However, some (for example, Boghossian&lt;ref name=Boghossian/&gt;) argue that Quine's rejection of the distinction is still widely accepted among philosophers, even if for poor reasons.

===Responses===
[[Paul Grice]] and [[P. F. Strawson]] criticized "Two Dogmas" in their 1956 article "In Defense of a Dogma".&lt;ref name=Defense/&gt; Among other things, they argue that Quine's [[skepticism]] about synonyms leads to a skepticism about meaning. If statements can have meanings, then it would make sense to ask "What does it mean?". If it makes sense to ask "What does it mean?", then synonymy can be defined as follows: Two sentences are synonymous if and only if the true answer of the question "What does it mean?" asked of one of them is the true answer to the same question asked of the other. They also draw the conclusion that discussion about correct or incorrect translations would be impossible given Quine's argument. Four years after Grice and Strawson published their paper, Quine's book ''[[Word and Object]]'' was released. In the book Quine presented his theory of [[indeterminacy of translation]].

In ''Speech Acts'', [[John Searle]] argues that from the difficulties encountered in trying to explicate analyticity by appeal to specific criteria, it does not follow that the notion itself is void.&lt;ref name=Searle/&gt; Considering the way which we would test any proposed list of criteria, which is by comparing their extension to the set of analytic statements, it would follow that any explication of what analyticity means presupposes that we already have at our disposal a working notion of analyticity.

In "'Two Dogmas' Revisited", [[Hilary Putnam]] argues that Quine is attacking two different notions:&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt;
{{quote|It seems to me there is as gross a distinction between 'All bachelors are unmarried' and 'There is a book on this table' as between any two things in this world, or at any rate, between any two linguistic expressions in the world;&lt;ref name=Putnam2/&gt;|Hilary Putnam|''Philosophical Papers'', p. 36}}

Analytic truth defined as a true statement derivable from a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] by putting synonyms for synonyms is near [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] account of analytic truth as a truth whose negation is a contradiction. Analytic truth defined as a truth confirmed no matter what, however, is closer to one of the traditional accounts of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. While the first four sections of Quine's paper concern analyticity, the last two concern a priority. Putnam considers the argument in the two last sections as independent of the first four, and at the same time as Putnam criticizes Quine, he also emphasizes his historical importance as the first top rank philosopher to both reject the notion of a priority and sketch a methodology without it.&lt;ref name=Putnam1/&gt;

[[Jerrold Katz]], a one-time associate of [[Noam Chomsky]], countered the arguments of "Two Dogmas" directly by trying to define analyticity non-circularly on the syntactical features of sentences.&lt;ref name=Linsky/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Katz1/&gt;

In ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 1 : The Dawn of Analysis'', [[Scott Soames]] has pointed out that Quine's circularity argument needs two of the logical positivists' central theses to be effective:&lt;ref name=Soames/&gt;

:All necessary (and all ''a priori'') truths are analytic

:Analyticity is needed to explain and legitimate necessity.

It is only when these two theses are accepted that Quine's argument holds. It is not a problem that the notion of necessity is presupposed by the notion of analyticity if necessity can be explained without analyticity. According to Soames, both theses were accepted by most philosophers when Quine published "Two Dogmas". Today, however, Soames holds both statements to be antiquated. He says: "Very few philosophers today would accept either [of these assertions], both of which now seem decidedly antique."&lt;ref name=Soames/&gt;

==Peikoff's criticisms==
Philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]], in his essay "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy",&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard, "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy" In ''Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology'' by Ayn Rand, Meridian Press, 1979, p 94 (first published in ''The Objectivist'' May 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; expands upon [[Ayn Rand]]'s analysis. He posits that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy presents men with the following choice: If your statement is proved, it says nothing about that which exists; if it is about existents, it cannot be proved. If it is demonstrated by logical argument, it represents a subjective convention; if it asserts a fact, logic cannot establish it. If you validate it by an appeal to the meanings of your ''concepts'', then it is cut off from reality; if you validate it by an appeal to your ''percepts'', then you cannot be certain of it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To Peikoff, the critical question is: What is included in the meaning of a concept?  He rejects the idea that some of the characteristics of a concept's referents are excluded from the concept.  Applying Rand's theory&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology,'' 2nd edition, Meridian (Penguin Books), 1990 (first published in ''The Objectivist,'' July 1966 - February 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;  that a concept is a "mental integration" of similar existents, treated as "units", he argues that concepts stand for and mean the actual existents, including all their characteristics, not just those used to pick out the referents or define the concept. He states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since a concept is an integration of units, it has no content or meaning apart from its units. The meaning of a concept consists of the units — the existents — which it integrates, including all the characteristics of these units.... The fact that certain characteristics are, at a given time, unknown to man, does not indicate that these characteristics are excluded from the entity — or from the concept.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, he argues that there is no valid distinction between "necessary" and "contingent" facts, and that all truths are learned and validated by the same process: the application of logic to perceptual data.  Associated with the analytic-synthetic dichotomy are a cluster of other divisions that Objectivism also regards as false and artificial, such as logical truth vs. factual truth, logically possible vs. empirically possible, and a priori vs. the a posteriori.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13084">The '''Apostolic Pastoral Congress''' or "Apostolic Pastoral Congress of Great Britain" ('''''Conventum Apostolicae Pastoralis Magnae Britanniae''''') is a collegiate collective of [[Christian]] bishops, pastors and other clergy in Great Britain.  It is part of the [[Pentecostal]] [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] movement.  Its bishops claim [[apostolic succession]].

The Apostolic Pastoral Congress is one of the forty-three "member-denominations" that together make up the membership of England's national [[ecumenical]] instrument: [[Churches Together in England]].&lt;ref name=CTEwebsite&gt;[http://www.cte.org.uk The website of Churches Together in England]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Congress is also a member of [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]].

The presiding [[prelate]] and executive director of the Congress is [[Doye Agama|Archbishop Doyé Agama]].  Archbishop Agama served as a trustee of Churches Together in England from March 2010 to November 2018.  He is a past co-president of [[Greater Manchester]] Churches Together, and he was the moderator of the Forum of Churches Together in England between 2012 and 2015.

The Congress is listed in the UK Directory of Black &amp; Multicultural Churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackmajoritychurches.co.uk Website of the UK Directory of Black &amp; Multicultural Churches]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the movement also includes several Asian churches and small numbers of white British churches as well.

The Congress is a member of the [[Evangelical Alliance|Evangelical Alliance of Great Britain]].

==History==
The Congress was formed (initially under the name "Apostolic Pastoral Association") during the first decade of the 21st century.  It started in the north of England and now has country-wide membership.  The Congress remains particularly active in Greater Manchester and the surrounding areas, and has its administrative office at Manchester.&lt;ref name=APCwebsite&gt;[http://www.apostolicpastors.info The website of the Apostolic Pastoral Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the presiding prelate of the Congress was elevated to the status of [[archbishop]], at a ceremony held in [[Southwark Cathedral]]&lt;ref&gt;Formally, Southwark Cathedral is "the cathedral and collegiate church of St Saviour and St Mary Overie, Southwark" - a Church of England cathedral, whose origins lie in a [[convent]] established on the south bank of the [[River Thames]] in the year 606 AD.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[London Bridge]] in central London, England.&lt;ref name=2013ordinal&gt;The APC Southwark Cathedral Ordinal booklet 19 October 2013 ''A Joint Service of Celebration, Ordination &amp; Licensing of Recognised Ministers hosted by the Apostolic Pastoral Congress and Awards by the Order of St Hadrian of Canterbury'' (51 pages).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
The Congress is Pentecostal in character, firmly [[evangelical]] in its [[soteriology]], [[sacrament]]al in theology and practice.&lt;ref name=APCwebsite/&gt;&lt;ref name=2013ordinal/&gt; members of the Congress use adapted forms of ancient church [[liturgy]] whenever sacraments are expressed, but at other times allow more open styles of Pentecostal worship.   As such, it may be identified as being part of the [[Convergence Movement]].

The Congress also promotes knowledge of and respect for the ancient Christian church of the [[first millennium]] in the [[British Isles]], and indeed knowledge of and respect for the ancient Christian church worldwide, and encourages disciplined prayer life based on insights derived from the early monastics.&lt;ref name=APCwebsite/&gt;&lt;ref name=2013ordinal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agama, DT ''Ancient Prayers for Today'' 2011 Chakam Limited {{ISBN|978-0-9568126-0-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress policy is to preach and practice Holy [[Baptism]] by full immersion in water, following confession of faith in Jesus Christ and a personal infilling of the [[Holy Spirit]], evidenced by  the biblical gifts (see [[spiritual gift]]) and [[fruit of the Holy Spirit]].  Congress is dedicated to promoting holy living which is the right result of salvation in Christ.&lt;ref name=2013ordinal/&gt;

There is particular emphasis upon the spiritual heritage deriving from early monastic communities such as those at Whithorn ([[Candida Casa]]) (see St [[Ninian]] of Whithorn) in Galloway, Scotland, [[Iona]] and [[Lindisfarne]] and from the seventh century north African ([[Berber people|Berber]]) scholar-monk [[Hadrian of Canterbury]] (Adrian of Canterbury) (Hadrian the African) (c.635 - 710) and [[Antony of Egypt]].

There is particular focus upon the African and Asian diaspora community in the Atlantic Isles and upon BAME (Black, Asian and other minority ethnic) community interests and affairs generally.

==Annual Pentecostal Summit==
For several years now, the Congress has organized and hosted an annual conference or "Pentecostal Summit" in an English cathedral, usually [[Manchester Cathedral]], though in 2013 Southwark Cathedral was used.  This event is combined with the Congress's annual ordination ceremony, and also with awards by the Apostolic Order of St Hadrian of Canterbury (see below).

==Other activities==
The Congress provides training, mentoring, networking, ordination and licensing.

==Related organizations==

===St Hadrian's College===
Training provision is mainly through St Hadrian's College.

===The Christian Way of Life Churches===
This is a group of Christian churches mainly in or around the Manchester area of England.  The Congress's current Presiding Prelate is also Senior Pastor of the Christian Way of Life Churches.  While the "Christian Way of Life Churches" and the Congress are distinct organizations, there is close synergy between them.&lt;ref&gt;The website of the principal congregation of the Christian Way of Life Churches www.wayoflifechurch.co.uk [http://www.wayoflifechurch.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Order of St Hadrian of Canterbury===
The '''Noble Communion and Holy Apostolic Order of St Hadrian of Canterbury''' is another organization very closely linked with the Congress.  The Order declares itself to be a Pentecostal Christian and educational Order.  The Order has as its grand patron Prince [[Ermias Sahle Selassie]] Haile Selassie.  Prince Ermias is a grandson of the Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] (1892-1975), and president of Ethiopia's Crown Council (a council in exile).&lt;ref name=APCwebsite/&gt;  The Order aims to promote aspects of monastic prayer life within black Pentecostal Christian churches.  The Order grants awards to individuals in recognition of outstanding service, and particularly recognizes outstanding community service by Christians from black and other minority ethnic backgrounds in the United Kingdom and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;see the statement on page 12 of the APC Southwark Cathedral Ordinal booklet 19 October 2013 ''A Joint Service of Celebration, Ordination &amp; Licensing of Recognised Ministers hosted by the Apostolic Pastoral Congress and Awards by the Order of St Hadrian of Canterbury'' (51 pages).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those who have been granted awards by the Order are Mrs [[Diezani Alison-Madueke]], Dr [[Goodluck Jonathan]], Bishop [[Nigel McCulloch]], and Bishop [[David Walker (bishop of Manchester)|David Walker]].

===International Apostolic Pastoral Congress===
(''Congres Pastoral Apostolique Internationale'')

This is the international arm of the organization and it is particularly active in Africa.

===Church of England (relations with)===
::''See also "Anglican Communion (relations with), below''
It has been said&lt;ref&gt;For example, by the bishop of Woolwich (Church of England) who, on 19 October 2013, when (speaking on behalf of the diocesan bishop of Southwark) he was formally and publicly welcoming the Congress to Southwark Cathedral for the Pentecostal Summit, stated that the Church of England enjoys long and close relations with the Apostolic Pastoral Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; that there are close relations between the [[Church of England]] and the Apostolic Pastoral Congress. This is exemplified by the fact that the Congress's presiding prelate leads a church that operates in Church of England church buildings, that Church of England bishops attend and participate in the Congress's Annual Pentecostal Summit, that a greeting from the [[archbishop of Canterbury]] was read at the 2013 Summit, and that the Summit and the Congress's ordinations take place within Church of England cathedrals.

The Congress is a designated church under the provisions of the Church of England's Ecumenical Relations Measure.

===Churches Together in England (relations with)===
The Congress is a member of Churches Together in England. The Congress's current (2014) presiding prelate is a member of the board of directors/trustees of Churches Together in England and he is moderator for the three year period 2012 to 2015 of the Forum of Churches Together in England.&lt;ref name=CTEwebsite/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charity Commission website, charity search facility: entry for Churches Together in England; names of trustees&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint College of African-American Pentecostal Bishops (relations with)===
The Congress's presiding prelate is a former member of this Joint College.  He is also a member of the House of Bishops of the [[Pentecostal Churches of Christ]] (based in USA).  

In 2013, the Consecration Mandate for elevating the Congress's presiding prelate, (Bishop (now Archbishop) Doyé Agama), to the status of archbishop was provided by [[J. Delano Ellis]] who is presiding prelate of the Joint College and also of the Pentecostal Churches of Christ.  Archbishop Ellis also sent an episcopal delegation (comprising Bishop Darryl Woodson and Bishop Benjamin Douglass) from USA to London to take the lead role in the ceremony of elevation. Bishops Woodson and Douglass are bishops among the Pentecostal Churches of Christ.&lt;ref name=2013ordinal/&gt;

===Anglican Communion (relations with)===
::''See also "Church of England (relations with)", above''
Bishop [[Duke Akamisoko]] ([[Church of Nigeria]]) was one of the bishops who laid hands upon the Congress's presiding prelate Doye Agama, at the ceremony in London on 19 October 2013 elevating Bishop Agama to the status of archbishop.   

Church of Nigeria is a church within the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]].

[[File:Art of Living International Ashram.JPG|thumb|Art of Living International Centre in Bengaluru]]
Art of Living Foundation (AOL) has its international headquarters in [[Bangalore]], India at Ved Vignan Mahavidyapeeth or VVM campus (usually referred to as [[The Art of Living International Center]] or the Bangalore Ashram) and has regional centers in more than 150 countries. In Europe, the organization is known as the Association for Inner Growth. The Foundation was founded by [[Sri Sri Ravi Shankar]], and offers a variety of personal-development and trauma-relief programs around the world.

AOL has been an educational and humanitarian organization in the U.S. since 1989. Accredited as a United Nations non-governmental organization in 1996, it works in special consultative status with the UN's Economic and Social Council, participating in a variety of committees and activities relating to health, education, sustainable development, conflict resolution, and disaster relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/coordination/ngo/ |title=United Nations - Department of Economic and Social Affairs - NGO Section |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=18 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110501104626/http://www.un.org/esa/coordination/ngo/| archivedate= 1 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Art of Living is a DPI NGO (Department of Public Information), which means it plays an active role in communicating and contributing to various United Nations goals (such as the UN Millennium Goals and the Stand Up initiative).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The majority of the officers of the organization, along with most of its teachers and staff, are volunteers. Many humanitarian programs, disaster relief efforts, and training programs are conducted through, or in conjunction with partner organization, the International Association for Human Values (IAHV).&lt;ref name=iahv_sch&gt;{{cite news|title=School for tsunami affected children inaugurated in Tamil Nadu|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-07-21/india/27994115_1_tsunami-free-education-school-compound|accessdate=30 July 2013|newspaper=THE TIMES OF INDIA|date=21 Jul 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2013}} Some of the key worldwide chapters include the Art of Living Foundation (U.S.A.), Vyakti Vikas Kendra (India), Die Kunst des Lebens (Germany), Art of Living Center (Canada), Art of Living South Africa, Art of Living Israel, Art of Living Brazil, and Art of Living Argentina.

Guided by Sri Sri’s philosophy of peace, "Unless we have a stress-free mind and a violence-free society, we cannot achieve world peace", the Art of Living offers several stress-elimination and self-development programmes based mainly on breathing techniques, meditation and yoga. Art of living hopeline, a telephonic hotline available 24/7, is a dedicated program to reduce suicidal tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Project Hope - World Alliance for Youth Empowerment}}{{full citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==

===Settlement with anonymous bloggers===
In 2010, Art of Living sued two anonymous bloggers, "Skywalker" and "Klim", accusing them of defamation, trade libel, copyright infringement and disclosing trade secrets. Claiming to be former teachers/followers in the organisation they created blogs critical of Art of Living. Art of Living's request to unmask Skywalker and Klim's identities was denied. Further, the judge allowed only the trade secrets claim to go to trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/unmasking-the-art-of-living/Content?oid=3221659 | title = Unmasking The Art of Living | publisher = East Bay Express | date = 6 June 2010 | accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15085">'''Bernard L. Ramm''' (1 August 1916 in [[Butte, Montana]] - 11 August 1992 in [[Irvine, California]]) was a [[Baptist]] theologian and [[apologist]] within the broad [[evangelicalism|Evangelical]] tradition. He wrote prolifically on topics concerned with [[biblical hermeneutics]], [[religion and science]], [[Christology]], and [[apologetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Benard Ramm entry (written by [[Kevin Vanhoozer]]) in ''Handbook of Evangelical Theologians''.

[[William H. Brackney]]. Mercer University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-86554-913-3}}. pp. 500&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s he was widely regarded as a leading evangelical theologian as well known as [[Carl F.H. Henry]].&lt;ref name=A-Z/&gt;    His equally celebrated and criticized 1954 book ''The Christian View of Science and Scripture'' was the theme of a 1979 issue of the ''[[Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation]]'', while a 1990 issue of [[Baylor University]]'s ''Perspectives in Religious Studies'' was devoted to Ramm's views on theology.

==Education==
Ramm initially studied chemistry then switched to philosophy of science in preparation for ministry. His tertiary education included a B.A. ([[University of Washington]]), B.D. ([[Eastern Baptist Seminary]]), M.A. in 1947 &amp; Ph.D in 1950 ([[University of Southern California]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1992/PSCF3-92Spradley.html PSCF 44 (March 1992): 2-9.]&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook additional studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[University of Basel]], Switzerland (1957-1958 academic year with [[Karl Barth]]),&lt;ref name=brack/&gt; and the [[Near Eastern School of Theology]], [[Beirut, Lebanon]].

==Career==
His academic teaching career began in 1943, when he joined the faculty at the [[Bible Institute of Los Angeles]] (now [[Biola University]], La Mirada, California). He became Professor of Philosophy at [[Bethel College and Seminary]], and then Professor of Religion at [[Baylor University]], Texas. Most of his academic teaching took place at the [[American Baptist Seminary of the West]] at Covina, California, where he taught 1958–74 and again 1978-86. At that seminary he held the post of Professor of [[Systematic Theology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Writings==
Ramm wrote eighteen books, contributed chapters to other books, and authored over one hundred articles and book reviews that were published in various theological periodicals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In his contributions to Christian apologetics, Ramm began his career in the [[evidentialist]] camp, but his later work reflected a shift in viewpoint to a modified form of [[presuppositional apologetics]] that had some affinity with the work of [[Edward John Carnell]]. In spite of harsh criticisms of [[Karl Barth]] from more traditionally [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] apologists such as [[Cornelius Van Til]], [[Gordon Clark]], and [[Carl F. H. Henry]], Ramm would explore much of Barth's theological viewpoint, eventually embracing Barth's theology almost wholeheartedly as outlined in Ramm's own book ''After Fundamentalism'' ([[Harper &amp; Row]], 1983).&lt;ref name=A-Z/&gt;

Ramm did not utilise the classical or Thomist approach in arguments for God's existence. He maintained that apart from faith God was unknowable. He likewise emphasised that the [[Nous|noetic]] effects of sin rendered theistic proofs useless. In Ramm's view, the proof of God's existence is in Holy Scripture.

He argued that the primary use of apologetic evidences is to create a favourable climate of opinion so that the Gospel may be proclaimed, and believed. In this respect he felt that miracles and fulfilled prophecy provided a factual basis for that climate of opinion. Ramm placed strong emphasis on the inner witness of the Holy Spirit verifying the gospel to the believer.

In some respects Ramm's emphasis on the inner witness of the Spirit reflected the view of [[John Calvin]], but it also reflected the influence of [[Karl Barth]], under whom he studied in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark A. Noll]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=m7cVN-1Kc6QC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=%22Bernard+Ramm%22&amp;lr= ''Between Faith and Criticism'']. Regent College Publishing, 2004.
{{ISBN|1-57383-098-4}}. pp.95, 178, 261, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of his life, Ramm was honored with a book of essays by his colleagues and younger contemporaries.

===Influence of ''The Christian View of Science and Scripture''===

In his book, ''The Christian View of Science and Scripture'', published in 1954, he was critical of "flood geology" and the notion of a young earth&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1993/PSCF12-93Yang.html Radiocarbon Dating and American Evangelical Christians&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and influenced the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] (ASA) in not supporting "flood geology" during the 1950s before [[Henry M. Morris]] and [[John C. Whitcomb]] popularised [[Young Earth Creationism]] and [[Flood geology]] in their 1961 book entitled ''The Genesis Flood''.

[[Reformed church|Reformed]] theologian [[Meredith G. Kline]] known for advancing the [[framework interpretation]] of Genesis cites this book in his influential article "Because It Had Not Rained" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/resources/WTJ/WTJ58Kline.html Because It Had Not Rained  The Westminster Theological Journal 20 (1958):146-157]&lt;/ref&gt; after having reviewed it three years earlier,&lt;ref name=kline&gt;Review of The Christian View of Science and Scripture, by R. Ramm. WTJ 18 (1955/56): 49-55.
&lt;/ref&gt; stating "It is, indeed, informative and provocative. Moreover, it has some good emphases. It can, therefore, be read profitably if read critically." yet cautioning "It would be well...for teachers of God's people to be hesitant or, at the least, very careful in providing public documentation of the history of their personal struggle after the truth." Kline also found Ramm's defense of the authority of scripture potentially inconsistent and Ramm's hermeneutical question regarding the place of [[natural revelation]] in interpreting scripture while a valid one, his approach in exploring and attempting to answer it done with too much zeal and dangerously close to being error-prone.&lt;ref name=kline/&gt;

The publisher's choice of title in particular its initial article ''The Christian View of Science and Scripture'' turned out to be a magnet for criticism.  Ramm's original title was  'The Evangelical Faith and Modern Science', but the publisher changed this in order for it to be similar to the title of [[James Orr (theologian)|James Orr]]'s 1893 book ''[[The Christian View of God and the World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1979/JASA12-79Hearn.html JASA 31: 179-186.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1979 marked the book's 25th anniversary, which was celebrated by the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] in devoting that year's December issue of its journal ''JASA'' to Ramm by including evaluations from theologians on the influence of ''The Christian View of Science and Scripture'' as well as an interview with Ramm and his wife Alta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1979/JASA12-79Haas.html JASA 31: 177]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of [[Religion and Science]] books, Covenant Theological Seminary professor and ordained [[Presbyterian Church in America|PCA]] minister [[C. John Collins]] called this book "a classic from a conservative evangelical author."&lt;ref&gt;''Science &amp; Faith: Friends or Foes?''. C. John Collins. Crossway, 2003. {{ISBN|1-58134-430-9}}. p.351.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence of ''Protestant Christian Evidences''===

His work ''Protestant Christian Evidences'' is considered a classic and is still often cited.

Professor Ramm is often quoted for writing the following in his work ''Protestant Christian Evidences'':

{{quote|Jews preserved it as no other [[manuscript]] has ever been preserved. With their [[Masoretes|massora]] they kept tabs on every letter, syllable, word, and paragraph. They had special classes of men within their culture whose sole duty was to preserve and transmit these documents with practically perfect fidelity&amp;nbsp;– [[scribe]]s, [[lawyer]]s, [[masoretes]].

In regard to the New Testament, there are about 13,000 manuscripts, complete and incomplete, in [[Greek language|Greek]] and other languages, that have survived from [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. 

A thousand times over, the death knell of the Bible has been sounded, the funeral procession formed, the inscription cut on the tombstone, and committal read. But somehow the corpse never stays put. No other book has been so chopped, knifed, sifted, scrutinized, and vilified. What book on philosophy or religion or psychology or belles lettres of classical or modern times has been subject to such a mass attack as the Bible? With such venom and skepticism? With such thoroughness and erudition? Upon every chapter, line and [[wikt:tenet|tenet]]?

The Bible is still loved by millions, read by millions, and studied by millions.}}

Ramm also stated, in his often cited work ''Protestant Christian Evidences'', the following: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A historic person named Jesus gave certain men such an impact as to be unequaled by far in the entire annals of the human race. After nearly two thousand years the impact is not at all spent, but daily there are people who have tremendous revolutionary experiences which they associate with Jesus Christ, be He dead or risen in Heaven. The personality of Jesus is without parallel. It is unique and incomparable (Protestant Christian Evidences [Chicago: Moody, 1953], p.&amp;nbsp;171).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Brahma Sampradaya''' (Brahma-sampradāya) refers to the disciplic succession (''[[sampradaya]]'') of [[guru]]s starting with [[Brahma]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kMnOBpUy7P4C&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=brahma+sampradaya+krishna&amp;lr=&amp;sig=jA_hkVDEv0lxnt5p6z-4HhnaoH8 Hinduism and Buddhism: An Historical Sketch - Page 239] Charles Eliot, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often used to refer to the beliefs and teachings of [[Madhvacharya]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=krBPtA-3_8UC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=brahma+sampradaya+krishna&amp;lr=&amp;sig=kcitc-fGvlfbcjhGBQCsrsMvPFI The Sadhus and Indian Civilisation - Page 57] Vijay Prakash Sharma - Sadhus - 1998 - 209 pages&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[Dvaita]] philosophy.

==Sampradaya==
Followers of this tradition believe that [[Vedas|Vedic]] knowledge descends from Brahma. In the Vedic conception, these sampradayas began at the creation of the universe and endure to the present moment due to the consistency of the transmission of knowledge, all the previous gurus are present in the teachings of the present spiritual master. The Vedic process assures that the transmission remains pure by assuring the qualifications of the transmitter.&lt;ref name = SDG&gt;{{Citation

'''Dulce Base''' is the subject of a [[ufo conspiracy theory|conspiracy theory]] claiming that a jointly-operated human and [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] underground facility exists under [[List of mountain peaks of Colorado|Archuleta Mesa]] on the Colorado-New Mexico border near the town of [[Dulce, New Mexico]], in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Donovan2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donovan|first=Barna William|title=Conspiracy Films: A Tour of Dark Places in the American Conscious|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJkhqU1IXHAC&amp;pg=PA149|date=29 July 2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8615-1|pages=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims of alien activity there first arose from [[Albuquerque]] businessman [[Paul Bennewitz]].&lt;ref name="Barkun2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Barkun|title=A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA111|accessdate=15 April 2012|date=4 May 2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24812-0|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Starting in 1979, Bennewitz became convinced he was intercepting electronic communications from alien spacecraft and installations outside of Albuquerque. By the 1980s he believed he had discovered a secret underground base near Dulce populated by [[grey aliens]] and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4391|number=391|title=8 Secret Bases: Real or Fictional|date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story spread rapidly within the UFO community and by 1987, [[UFOlogist]] John Lear claimed he had independent confirmations of the base's existence.&lt;ref name="Gulyas2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gulyas|first=Aaron John|title=Conspiracy Theories: The Roots, Themes and Propagation of Paranoid Political and Cultural Narratives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afcEDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|date=25 January 2016|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-9726-3|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] ''[[Weekly World News]]'' published a story entitled "UFO Base Found in New Mexico" which claimed that "diabolical invaders from another solar system have set up a secret underground base in the rugged mountains of northern New Mexico – so they can shanghai human guinea pigs for bizarre genetic experiments". The ''Weekly World News'' story used supposed quotes from UFOlogist [[Leonard Stringfield]] as a source for its claims. Upon learning of the story, Stringfield protested, "I never read such a distortion of facts in my life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bird |first1=Kay |last2=Terrel |first2=Steve |date=1 September 1988 |title=ETs living in NM? Not likely, investigators say |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21779090/ets_living_in_nm_not_likely/ |newspaper=The Santa Fe New Mexican |volume=139 |issue=255 |pages=A-1, A-2 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Political scientist [[Michael Barkun]] writes that [[Cold War]] underground missile installations in the area gave superficial plausibility to the rumors, making the Dulce base story an "attractive legend" within UFOlogy. According to Barkun, claims about experiments on abductees and firefights between aliens and the [[Delta Force]] place the Dulce legend "well outside even the most far-fetched reports of secret underground bases."&lt;ref name="Barkun2006" /&gt;

Residents of Dulce claim to have seen UFOs, moving lights, and other unexplained sights in the area, which has little economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/life/features/move-over-roswell-dulce-is-home-to-true-ufo-believers/article_3164df9a-9813-5add-9b16-5e3a90c0340e.html |date=7 May 2016 |title=Move over, Roswell.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7515">'''Eduardo Guillermo Carrasco Pirard''' (born July 2, 1940 in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]) is a Chilean musician, university professor of philosophy, author, and one of the founders of the Chilean folk music group [[Quilapayún]] -  and the group's musical director from 1969 to 1989.
[[File:eduardocarrasco.jpg|thumb|300px|Eduardo Carrasco in 2009.]]

==Biography==
Carraco studied at the elite José Victorino Lastarria Lyceum in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] and then entered the [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile]] to study [[philosophy]]; he subsequently travelled to Germany to study at the  [[University of Heidelberg|Ruprecht Karl Universitat of Heidelberg]]. In 1964 he returned to Chile to continue his study of philosophy at the [[University of Chile]] and in 1965 he forms the musical ensemble [[Quilapayun]] with his brother Julio Carrasco and his friend [[Julio Numhauser]].

Carrasco completed his formal study of philosophy in April 1970 when he submitted a thesis on [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]; he then commenced to study music at the National Conservatorium of the [[University of Chile]] until the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|Chilean military coup of September 11, 1973]].

The years following the military coup saw Carrasco involved primarily in artistic and political projects. After the coup [[Quilapayún]] becomes the voice of the Chilean resistance and Carrasco tours with the ensemble which performs in the  venues in the world, including, Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall, the Olympia in Paris and in the Tokio Centre.

A [[virtuoso]] of the [[quena]] and wind instruments and a distinctive bass vocalist of the group. He appeared as solo vocalist in many of the groups recordings, among them  “''Pregon Inicial”''   of the [[Cantata Santa María de Iquique]];  ''“Con el alma llena de Banderas”''   of the [[El pueblo unido jamás sera vencido]] album; and ''"Canción para [[Víctor Jara]]"''.     From the beginning he proved himself as a  composer with pieces such as  ''“El canto del cuculi”''  and ''“La cueca triste”''  - co-jointly with [[Víctor Jara]] – and later after acquiring formal training in the field of music he created some of the most significant work of the group, such as ''“Vals de Colombes”,  “Elegia al Che Guevara”,  “Ausencia”''  with [[Rodolfo Parada]], ''”Canción de la esperanza”'' and ''“Luz negra”''. Carrasco forged the concept of ''“La revolucion y las estrellas”/''(The revolution and the stars) which signified an evolution in the alignment of Quilapayún.

Carrasco has written numerous books including two book about Quilapayún; the first (under the pseudonym of Ignacio Santander) and the second ''“Quilapayún, la Revolución y Las Estrellas.” ''   He has also publishing numerous works of poetry, philosophy and his conversations with the Chilean painter [[Roberto Matta]], and with the Chilean philosopher [[Roberto Torretti]]. Once Quilapayún was able to return to [[Chile]] from [[exile]] in 1988, Carrasco maintained that the true place for the group was Chile, since other group members needed to return to France, he decided to remain in Chile and leave the group.

In Chile he has held numerous posts: as professor of philosophy at the [[Universidad de Chile]]; as director in the School of Music of the ''"Sociedad Chilena del Derecho de Author"''  and in the cultural division of the Chilean Ministry of Education. In 2003 Carrasco formed a Chilean based Quilapayun named ''Quilapayún Histórico'' (despite the fact that in France Quilapayún were still releasing new albums and touring as the group had always done whilst in exile) which included some of the original members and Ismael Oddo (the son of [[Willy Oddo]] who was assassinated in 1991). Carrasco toured extensively with ''Quilapayún Histórico'' and one of their concerts held on September 11, 2003 to commemorate 30th Anniversary of the death of  [[Salvador Allende]] was released as a DVD titled ‘[[El Reencuentro]]’ (The Re-encounter).

==Awards==
Carrasco has earned numerous award from Chile and from international organizations, including:
*''Orden al Mérito Docente y Cultural Gabriela Mistral
*''Premio de la Academia "Charles le Gros"
*''Diploma of Honor with the highest distinctions awarded by the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] and the Interamerican Council of Music of Washington DC

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3379">The '''epistemic virtues,''' as identified by [[virtue epistemology|virtue epistemologists]], reflect their contention that belief is an ethical process, and thus susceptible to the intellectual [[virtue]] or [[vice]] of one's own life and personal experiences. Some epistemic virtues have been identified by [[W. Jay Wood]], based on research into the [[medieval]] tradition. 

==Overview==
Being an epistemically virtuous person is often equated with being a [[critical thinking|critical thinker]]&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, M., &amp; Trout, J. D.  2004.  ''Epistemology and the Psychology of Human Judgment''.  Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and focuses on the human agent and the kind of practices that make it possible to arrive at the best accessible approximation of the truth.{{R|"Pigliucci"}}

Epistemic virtues include [[conscientiousness]]&lt;ref&gt;Greco, John. 2011. {{cite SEP |url-id=epistemology-virtue |title=Virtue Epistemology}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the following:{{R|"Pigliucci"}}
* attentiveness
* benevolence (principle of charity)
* [[creativity]]
* [[curiosity]] [see below]
* [[discernment]]
* [[honesty]]
* [[humility]]
* [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]]
* [[Occam's razor|parsimony]]
* studiousness
* [[understanding]]
* warranty
* [[wisdom]]

These can be contrasted to the ''epistemic vices'' such as:
* closed-mindedness
* curiosity [see below]
* [[dogma]]tism
* epistemic blindness
* [[folly (disambiguation)|folly]]
* [[gullibility]]
* [[intellectual dishonesty]]
* obtuseness
* self-deception
* [[superficiality]] of thought
* [[superstition]]
* willful naïveté
* [[wishful thinking]]

Note that in this context ''curiosity'' bears the medieval connotation of attraction to unwholesome things, in contrast to the positive ''studious'' (or perhaps ''inquisitive'').

'''Evidence-based subjective logic''' ('''EBSL''') is a variant&lt;ref name="SdHZ"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skoric | first1 = B. | last2 = Zannone | first2 = N. | year = | title = Flow-based reputation with uncertainty: Evidence-Based Subjective Logic | journal = International Journal of Information Security| volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi=10.1007/s10207-015-0298-5| arxiv = 1402.3319}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[subjective logic]] in which the transitivity of opinions (discounting) is handled by applying weights to the evidence underlying the opinions.
Subjective logic is based on [[Dempster-Shafer theory|Dempster–Shafer belief theory]].
The discounting rule in [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3319.pdf EBSL] makes it possible to handle arbitrary trust networks.

==Relation between evidence and opinions==
Consider a [[Proposition#Treatment in logic|proposition]] P.
Let ''p'' be the amount of evidence supporting P, and ''n'' the amount of evidence supporting &amp;not;P. We write the evidence as a vector (''p'', ''n''). Let ''c'' be a positive constant representing a "unit" of evidence. An [[Subjective Logic#Subjective opinions|opinion]] (''b'', ''d'', ''u'') is formed on the basis of the evidence (''p'', ''n''), in which ''b'',''d'', and ''u'' respectively quantify the level of belief, disbelief and uncertainty in P. There is a one-to-one mapping between the opinion and the evidence,

: &lt;math&gt;
(b,d,u)=\frac{(p,n,c)}{p+n+c}
\quad\quad
(p,n)=c\frac{(b,d)}{u}.
\quad\quad (1)
&lt;/math&gt;

In the original literature on subjective logic the constant was set to
''c'' = 2.
The mapping (1) is the unique solution of the following set of constraints,&lt;ref name="SdHZ" /&gt;
*''b''/''d'' = ''p''/''n''.
*''b'' + ''d'' + ''u'' = 1.
*''p'' + ''n'' = 0 implies ''u'' = 1.
*&lt;math&gt;p\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;u\to 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Alternatively, (1) can be derived from an analysis of 
[[Posterior probability|a posteriori probability]] 
distributions&lt;ref name="J01"&gt;A. Jøsang. A Logic for Uncertain Probabilities. ''[[International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems]].'' 9(3), pp. 279–311, June 2001. [http://folk.uio.no/josang/papers/Jos2001-IJUFKS.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;
([[beta distribution]]s).
&lt;br&gt;
There are three "corner points" in opinion space:
the full Belief B = (1,0,0),
the full Disbelief D = (0,1,0),
and full Uncertainty U = (0,0,1).
Opinions on the line between B and D (including B and D) are called "dogmatic opinions". They have zero uncertainty, which is achievable only with an infinite amount of evidence. Dogmatic opinions are often excluded from the algebra.

==Consensus / fusion==
The consensus operation combines two opinions about the same predicate into one opinion by piling up the evidence.
Let ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;) 
and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;) 
be the opinions that are to be fused, and 
''z'' = ''x'' &amp;oplus; ''y'' the result.
We denote their evidence vectors as
(''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;),
(''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;)
and
(''p''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;)
respectively.
In evidence space the consensus is straightforwardly defined as

: &lt;math&gt;
(p_z,n_z) = (p_x,n_x)+(p_y,n_y).
&lt;/math&gt;

In opinion space this yields

: &lt;math&gt;
x\oplus y = \frac{(p_x+p_y,n_x+n_y,c)}{p_x+p_y+n_x+n_y+c}
&lt;/math&gt;

which using (1) can be rewritten as

: &lt;math&gt;
x\oplus y = \frac{(x_{\rm u} y_{\rm b}+y_{\rm u} x_{\rm b},x_{\rm u} y_{\rm d}+y_{\rm u} x_{\rm d},x_{\rm u} y_{\rm u})}
{x_{\rm u}+y_{\rm u}-x_{\rm u} y_{\rm u}}.
\quad\quad (2)
&lt;/math&gt;

The consensus rule can only be applied if the evidence underlying
''x'' and ''y'' is independent, otherwise ''double counting'' of evidence occurs.

==Discounting==

===Old discounting rule (&amp;otimes;)===
The traditional discounting operation in Subjective Logic is denoted as 
&amp;otimes; and defined as

: &lt;math&gt;
x\otimes y \stackrel{\rm def}{=} 
(x_{\rm b}y_{\rm b}, x_{\rm b}y_{\rm d},1-x_{\rm b}y_{\rm b} - x_{\rm b}y_{\rm d}).
&lt;/math&gt;
This operation suffers from a number of serious problems, e.g.

*There is no natural interpretation of the evidence underlying ''x'' &amp;otimes; ''y'' when (1) is applied.
*Consider the following. Alice has trust ''x'' in Bob. Bob gathers two independent evidence vectors, (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), about some proposition P. &lt;br&gt; Scenario I: Bob forms two indendent opinions, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, based on the evidence. He sends ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  to Alice.  Alice forms opinion &lt;math&gt;(x\otimes y_1)\oplus(x\otimes y_2)&lt;/math&gt; about P. &lt;br&gt; Scenario II: Bob combines his evidence and forms opinion &lt;math&gt;y_1\oplus y_2&lt;/math&gt;. He then sends &lt;math&gt;y_1\oplus y_2&lt;/math&gt; to Alice. Alice forms opinion &lt;math&gt;x\otimes (y_1\oplus y_2)&lt;/math&gt; about P. &lt;br&gt; It is obvious that these scenarios should yield the same result for Alice. Yet the traditional discounting rule gives: &lt;math&gt;
x\otimes(y_1\oplus y_2)\neq (x\otimes y_1)\oplus(x\otimes y_2).
&lt;/math&gt;
These problems make it very difficult to handle trust networks in subjective logic.

===The product of a scalar and an opinion===
Let ''x'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;) be an opinion based on evidence (''p'', ''n''). Let &amp;lambda; &amp;ge; 0 be a scalar. The product &amp;lambda; &amp;sdot; ''x'' is defined&lt;ref name="SdHZ" /&gt; as  (&amp;lambda; ''p'', &amp;lambda; ''n'') in evidence space, which corresponds to

: &lt;math&gt;
\lambda\cdot x=\frac{(\lambda x_{\rm b},\lambda x_{\rm d},x_{\rm u})}
{\lambda(x_{\rm b}+x_{\rm d})+x_{\rm u}}
\quad\quad (3)
&lt;/math&gt;

in opinion space.

===The discounting rule (&amp;#9746;) in EBSL===
Let ''x'' and ''y'' be opinions. Let ''g'' be a mapping from opinion space to [0,1] satisfying
''g''(B) = 1 and ''g''(D) = 0.

In EBSL the discounting of ''y'' through ''x'' is denoted as ''x'' &amp;#9746; ''y'' and defined as&lt;ref name="SdHZ" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\quad
x \boxtimes y \stackrel{\rm def}{=} g(x)\cdot y, 
\quad \quad (4)
&lt;/math&gt;

with the "dot" product as specified in (3).

The function ''g'' can be chosen at will, depending on the context. The &amp;#9746; rule has a very simple interpretation in evidence space: Due to the disbelief and uncertainty present in ''x'', only a fraction ''g''(''x'') of the evidence in ''y'' survives.

The &amp;#9746; operation avoids all the inconsistencies of the &amp;otimes; operation.
The following properties hold,

* &lt;math&gt;x\boxtimes (y_1\oplus y_2)=(x\boxtimes y_1)\oplus (x\boxtimes y_2)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x_1\boxtimes(x_2\boxtimes y)=x_2\boxtimes(x_1\boxtimes y)&lt;/math&gt;.

There is no [[Associative property|associativity]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;x_1\boxtimes(x_2\boxtimes y)\neq(x_1\boxtimes x_2)\boxtimes y&lt;/math&gt;, in contrast to the &amp;otimes; operation. This is not a problem, since the flow if information in a trust network has a well defined direction.

Also, we have

: &lt;math&gt; 
(x_1\oplus x_2)\boxtimes y \neq (x_1\boxtimes y)\oplus (x_2\boxtimes y).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Computation of opinions in arbitrary trust networks==

EBSL makes it possible to compute [[Trust metric|trust values]]
even when the graph connecting the users in the trust network
is complicated.
This makes EBSL interesting e.g. for [[Reputation system]]s

Let ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; be the opinion that user ''i'' has about the trustworthiness of user ''j'', based on ''direct evidence'', e.g. direct interactions between ''i'' and ''j''. We set ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''ii''&lt;/sub&gt; = U.
Let every user publish these direct opinions in a reliable way;
the matrix ''A'' is public and its integrity is guaranteed.&lt;br&gt;
Based on all the available trust information, direct as well as indirect,
what should a user conclude about the trustworthiness of all the other users?
In general this is a nontrivial problem because of the complicated 
connection graphs, in which loops may occur.
The problem is to find a "reputation" matrix ''R'' that consistently
combines the direct and indirect evidence.
In EBSL the following "self-consistent" (self-containing)
equation must be satisfied&lt;ref name="SdHZ" /&gt; by ''R'',

: &lt;math&gt; \mbox{For }i\neq j:\quad
R_{ij}=A_{ij}\oplus \sum_{k:\,k\neq i}R_{ik}\boxtimes A_{kj}
\quad\quad (5)
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\mbox{Diagonal: }R_{ii}=B.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the "&amp;Sigma;" stands for &amp;oplus; operations.
The diagonal is set to full belief since everybody trusts himself implicitly,
independent of other users' opinions.
&lt;br&gt;
User ''i'' forms an opinion about ''j'' by combining
his direct opinion ''A''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;
with other users' opinions ''A''&lt;sub&gt;kj&lt;/sub&gt;.
The indirect evidence is weighted with a scalar that depends on the
reputation of the intermediary: ''g''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;).

Equation (5) can be written compactly in matrix form,

: &lt;math&gt;
R = B{\mathbf 1}\oplus (R\boxtimes A).\quad\quad (6)
&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf 1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity matrix]], and
summation should be executed as &amp;oplus;.
Eq.(6) is a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] equation similar to the case of [[Markov chain]]s.
It can be solved [[Fixed-point iteration|recursively]].
Let ''X'' be a square matrix with the same dimensions as ''A''.
Define a function f as

: &lt;math&gt;f(X)=B{\mathbf 1}\oplus (X\boxtimes A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Pick a starting matrix &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; and repeatedly apply f
until the result does not change any more, i.e. a fixed point
&lt;math&gt;R=f(R)&lt;/math&gt; is reached.
Independent of the choice of &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt;,
after one iteration the diagonal is B'''1'''
and stays B'''1''' in all further iterations.
&lt;br&gt;
If Eq.(6) were an ordinary matrix equation &lt;math&gt;R={\mathbf 1}+RA&lt;/math&gt; 
for real-valued (or complex) ''A''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;,
it would have solution &lt;math&gt;R=({\mathbf 1}-A)^{-1}={\mathbf 1}+\sum_{k\geq 1}A^k&lt;/math&gt;.
However, the opinion algebra does not allow for such a simple expression.
Instead we have

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
f&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = B'''1''' &amp;oplus; ((B'''1''' &amp;oplus; (''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;#9746; ''A'')) &amp;#9746; ''A'')

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
f&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) =
B'''1''' &amp;oplus; ((B'''1''' &amp;oplus; (
B'''1''' &amp;oplus; (''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;#9746; ''A'') 
&amp;#9746; ''A'')) &amp;#9746; ''A'')

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
...

which in general cannot be simplified.

'''Frances Hamilton Arnold''' (born July 25, 1956)&lt;ref name=Nobel /&gt; is an American [[chemical engineer]] and [[Nobel Laureate]]. She is the Linus Pauling Professor of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering and Biochemistry at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech). In 2018, she was awarded [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for pioneering the use of [[directed evolution]] to engineer [[enzyme]]s.

==Early life and education==
Arnold is the daughter of Josephine Inman (née Routheau) and nuclear physicist [[William Howard Arnold (physicist)|William Howard Arnold]], and the granddaughter of Lieutenant General [[William Howard Arnold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/24773/chapter/4|title=Memorial Tributes|date=September 26, 2017|publisher=National Academies Press|doi=10.17226/24773|isbn=978-0-309-45928-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in [[Pittsburgh]] suburb [[Edgewood, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Edgewood]], and Pittsburgh neighborhoods of [[Shadyside (Pittsburgh)|Shadyside]] and [[Squirrel Hill (Pittsburgh)|Squirrel Hill]], graduating from the city's [[Taylor Allderdice High School]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guarino |first1=Ben |title='Her work is incredible': Pittsburgh native Frances Arnold shares Nobel Prize in chemistry |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/science/2018/10/03/Nobel-Prize-chemistry-scientists-frances-arnold-pittsburgh-evolution/stories/201810030120 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a high schooler, she hitchhiked to [[Washington, D.C.]] to protest the Vietnam War and lived on her own working as a cocktail waitress at a local jazz club and a cab driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kharif|first=Olga|title=Frances Arnold's Directed Evolution|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-15/frances-arnolds-directed-evolution|accessdate=September 1, 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold graduated in 1979 with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[aerospace engineering]] from [[Princeton University]], where she focused on solar energy research.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.princeton.edu/news/2018/10/03/princeton-engineering-alumna-frances-arnold-wins-nobel-prize-chemistry|title=Princeton engineering alumna Frances Arnold wins Nobel Prize in Chemistry|work=Princeton University|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the courses required for her major, she took classes in economics, Russian, and Italian, and envisioned herself as becoming a diplomat or CEO, even considering getting an advance degree in international affairs.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/alternative_energy/2013/03/directed_evolution_frances_arnold_engineers_green_chemistry_molecules.html|title=The Director of Evolution|last=Ouellette|first=Jennifer|date=2013-03-08|work=Slate|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took a year off from Princeton after her second year to travel to Italy and work in a factory that made [[nuclear reactor]] parts, then returned to finish out her studies.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://paw.princeton.edu/article/evolution-gets-assist|title=Evolution Gets an Assist|date=2014-10-17|work=Princeton Alumni Weekly|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back at Princeton, she began studying with Princeton's Center for Energy and Environmental Studies – a group of scientists and engineers, at the time led by [[Robert H. Socolow|Robert Socolow]], working to develop sustainable energy sources, a topic that would become a key focus of Arnold's later work.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

After graduating from Princeton in 1979, Arnold worked as an engineer in South Korea and Brazil and at Colorado's [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|Solar Energy Research Institute]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; At the Solar Energy Research Institute (now the National Renewable Energy Laboratory), she worked on designing solar energy facilities for remote locations and helped write [[United Nations]] (UN) position papers.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

She then enrolled at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she earned [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in [[chemical engineering]] in 1985&lt;ref name="thesis-arnold-1985"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/303363741/ |title=Design and Scale-Up of Affinity Separations) |date=1985 |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |type=PhD |last=Arnold |first=Frances Hamilton |via=[[ProQuest]] |subscription=yes |oclc=910485566}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became deeply interested in biochemistry in the process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nae.edu/115564.aspx|title=Frances H.

==Career==
After earning her Ph.D., Arnold completed postdoctoral research in [[biophysical chemistry]] at Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chemistryviews.org/details/ezine/1376211/Interview_with_Frances_H__Arnold__Design_by_Evolution.html|title=Interview with Frances H.

She was promoted to assistant professor in 1986, associate professor in 1992, and full professor in 1996. She was named the Dick and Barbara Dickinson Professor of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering and Biochemistry in 2000 and, her current position, the Linus Pauling Professor of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering and Biochemistry in 2017.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.caltech.edu/news/frances-arnold-wins-2018-nobel-prize-chemistry-83926|title=Frances Arnold Wins 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry {{!}} Caltech|work=The California Institute of Technology|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, she was appointed director of Caltech's Donna and Benjamin M. Rosen Bioengineering Center.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Arnold is a member of the Advisory Board of the [[Joint BioEnergy Institute]] and the Packard Fellowships in Science and Engineering, and she serves on the President's Advisory Council of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology ([[KAUST]]).  She is currently serving as a judge for [[The Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering]]. She worked with the [[National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Science's]] [[Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange]] to help Hollywood screenwriters accurately portray science topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaas.org/frances-arnolds-directed-evolution|title=Frances Arnold's directed evolution|website=American Association for the Advancement of Science|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is co-inventor on over 40 US patents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She co-founded [[Gevo, Inc]]., a company to make fuels and chemicals from renewable resources in 2005.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2013, she and two of her former students, Peter Meinhold and Pedro Coelho, cofounded a company called Provivi to research alternatives to [[pesticide]]s for crop protection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/frances-arnold-directed-evolution-millennium-technology-prize_us_57486774e4b055bb1171f2eb|title=Meet The Woman Who Launched A New Field of Scientific Study|last=Freeman|first=David|date=2016-05-31|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been on the corporate board of the genomics company [[Illumina (company)|Illumina Inc.]] since 2016.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/nobel-winner-overcame-personal-loss-cancer-being-woman-n916391|title=This Nobel winner lost a son and two husbands and survived cancer|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/board-of-directors.html|title=Board of Directors|website=Illumina|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
Arnold is credited with pioneering the use of [[directed evolution]] to create [[enzyme]]s (biochemical molecules—often proteins—that [[Catalysis|catalyze]], or speed up, chemical reactions) with improved and/or novel functions.&lt;ref name="TNP"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2018 |url=https://old.nobelprize.org/che-press.pdf?_ga=2.87232604.535716584.1538560295-715396971.1538560295 |publisher=The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences |accessdate=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[directed evolution]] strategy involves iterative rounds of randomly mutating proteins' genes and screening for proteins with improved functions and it has been used to create useful [[biological system]]s, including [[enzyme]]s, [[metabolic pathway]]s, [[genetic regulatory circuit]]s, and organisms. In nature, evolution by [[natural selection]] can lead to proteins (including enzymes) well-suited to carry out biological tasks, but natural selection can only act on existing sequence variations (mutations) and typically occurs over long time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cirino|first=Patrick C.|pages=215–243|publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA|isbn=978-3-527-30423-3|last2=Arnold|first2=Frances H.|doi=10.1002/3527600647.ch10|title=Directed Molecular Evolution of Proteins|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold speeds up the process by introducing mutations in the underlying sequences of proteins; she then tests these mutations' effects. If a mutation improves the proteins' function she can keep iterating the process to optimize it further. This strategy has broad implications because it can be used to design proteins for a wide variety of applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 3, 2018|title=Scientific Background on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2018|url=https://old.nobelprize.org/che-sci.pdf?_ga=2.228216788.850160180.1538560699-1556534510.1538560699|journal=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, she has used directed evolution to design enzymes that can be used to produce [[renewable fuels]] and pharmaceutical compounds with less harm to the environment.&lt;ref name="TNP" /&gt;

One advantage of directed evolution is that the mutations do not have to be completely random; instead they can be random enough to discover unexplored potential, but not so random as to be inefficient. The number of possible mutation combinations is astronomical, but instead of just randomly trying to test as many as possible, Arnold integrates her knowledge of biochemistry to narrow down the options, focusing on introducing mutations in areas of the protein that are likely to have the most positive effect on activity and avoiding areas in which mutations would likely be, at best, neutral and at worst, detrimental (such as disrupting proper protein folding).&lt;ref name="TNP" /&gt;

Arnold applied directed evolution to the optimization of enzymes (although not the first person to do so, see e.g. Barry Hall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Barry G.|date=1978|title=Experimental Evolution of a New Enzymatic Function. II. Evolution of Multiple Functions for EBG Enzyme in E. coli|journal=Genetics|volume=89|pages=453–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In&lt;ref name="TNP" /&gt; her seminal work, published in 1993, she used the method to engineer a version of [[subtilisin]] E that was active in a highly unnatural environment, namely in the organic solvent [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=K.|last2=Arnold|first2=F. H.|date=1993-06-15|title=Tuning the activity of an enzyme for unusual environments: sequential random mutagenesis of subtilisin E for catalysis in dimethylformamide.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=90|issue=12|pages=5618–5622|doi=10.1073/pnas.90.12.5618|issn=0027-8424}}&lt;/ref&gt; She carried out the work using four sequential rounds of mutagenesis of the enzyme's [[gene]], expressed by bacteria, through error-prone [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. After each round she screened the enzymes for their ability to [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] the milk protein [[casein]] in the presence of DMF by growing the bacteria on agar plates containing casein and DMF. The bacteria secreted the enzyme and, if it were functional, it would hydrolyze the casein and produce a visible halo. She selected the bacteria that had the biggest halos and isolated their DNA for further rounds of mutagenesis.&lt;ref name="TNP" /&gt; Using this method, she designed an enzyme that had 256 times more activity in DMF than the original.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernholm|first=Ann|date=October 3, 2018|title=A (r)evolution in chemistry|url=https://old.nobelprize.org/che-popular.pdf|journal=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2018: Popular Science Background|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her seminal work, Arnold has further developed her methods and applied them under different selection criteria in order to optimize enzymes for different functions. She showed that, whereas naturally evolved enzymes tend to function well at a narrow temperature range, enzymes could be produced using directed evolution that could function at both high and low temperatures.&lt;ref name="TNP" /&gt; In addition to improving the existing functions of natural enzymes, Arnold has designed enzymes that perform functions for which no previous specific enzyme existed, such as when she evolved [[cytochrome P450]] to carry out [[cyclopropanation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coelho|first=Pedro S.|last2=Brustad|first2=Eric M.|last3=Kannan|first3=Arvind|last4=Arnold|first4=Frances H.|date=2013-01-18|title=Olefin cyclopropanation via carbene transfer catalyzed by engineered cytochrome P450 enzymes|journal=Science |volume=339|issue=6117|pages=307–310|doi=10.1126/science.1231434|issn=1095-9203|pmid=23258409}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[carbene]] and [[nitrene]] transfer reactions.&lt;ref name="TNP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prier|first=Christopher K.|last2=Hyster|first2=Todd K.|last3=Farwell|first3=Christopher C.|last4=Huang|first4=Audrey|last5=Arnold|first5=Frances H.|date=2016-04-04|title=Asymmetric Enzymatic Synthesis of Allylic Amines: A Sigmatropic Rearrangement Strategy|journal=Angewandte Chemie (International Ed.

In addition to evolving individual molecules, Arnold has used directed evolution to co-evolve enzymes in biosynthetic pathways, such as those involved in the production of [[carotenoid]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt-Dannert|first=C.|last2=Umeno|first2=D.|last3=Arnold|first3=F. H.|date=July 1, 2000|title=Molecular breeding of carotenoid biosynthetic pathways|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=18|issue=7|pages=750–753|doi=10.1038/77319|issn=1087-0156|pmid=10888843}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Methionine|L-methionine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=May|first=O.|last2=Nguyen|first2=P. T.|last3=Arnold|first3=F. H.|date=March 1, 2000|title=Inverting enantioselectivity by directed evolution of hydantoinase for improved production of L-methionine|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=317–320|doi=10.1038/73773|issn=1087-0156|pmid=10700149}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (which has the potential to be used as a whole-cell biocatalyst).&lt;ref name="TNP" /&gt;

Arnold has applied these methods to [[biofuel]] production. For example, she evolved bacteria to produce the biofuel [[isobutanol]]; it can be produced in ''E. coli'' bacteria, but the production pathway requires the [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]], whereas E. coli makes the cofactor [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]]. To circumvent this problem, Arnold evolved the enzymes in the pathway to use NADH instead of NADPH, allowing for the production of isobutanol.&lt;ref name="TNP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bastian|first=Sabine|last2=Liu|first2=Xiang|last3=Meyerowitz|first3=Joseph T.|last4=Snow|first4=Christopher D.|last5=Chen|first5=Mike M.

Arnold has also used directed evolution to design highly specific and efficient enzymes that can be used as environmentally-friendly alternatives to some industrial chemical synthesis procedures.&lt;ref name="TNP" /&gt; She, and others using her methods, have engineered enzymes that can carry out synthesis reactions more quickly, with fewer by-products, and in some cases eliminating the need for hazardous [[heavy metals]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The method has been adopted by some groups in pharmacology. For example, one of Arnold's former students, Jeffrey Moore, and colleagues used directed evolution to evolve an enzyme to produce the diabetes drug [[sitagliptin]] (Januvia).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Arnold also uses structure-guided protein recombination to combine parts of different proteins to form protein chimeras with unique functions. She developed computational methods, such as [[SCHEMA (bioinformatics)|SCHEMA]], to predict how the parts can be combined without disrupting their parental structure, so that the chimeras will fold properly, and then applies directed evolution to further mutate the chimeras to optimize their functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cheme.che.caltech.edu/groups/fha/Projects2.htm|title=Structure-guided protein recombination|last=|first=|date=|website=The Frances H.

'''Future Worlds Center''' (FWC) is a non-profit, non-Governmental independent organization active in programs with future orientation in areas related to [[Social change|positive social change]], [[social entrepreneurship]] and [[Social transformation|transformation]].

==Founding history==
Future Worlds Center was founded in 1991 as [[Cyprus Neuroscience and Technology Institute]]. In the late 90's, it expanded its operations pioneering in a number of humanitarian, multicultural and peace related projects,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MulticulturalCyprus.net/ Building A Multi-Ethnic and Multi-National Cyprus to Promote European Values and Regional and International Peace]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eucitizenship.net/ Extending EU Citizenship to the Eastern End of Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2005, with a new Constitution, it evolved into a larger organization with a pure international orientation integrating all humanitarian, peace, and multicultural activities under one umbrella.

==Notable Operations==
According to its new Constitution, Future Worlds Center is an incubator of ideas, projects, social entrepreneurs and organizations committed to socio-technical reforms&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futureworlds.eu/wiki/Future_Worlds_Center_Vision_and_Mission&lt;/ref&gt;. Since its inception it has envisioned, designed and implemented more than 100 projects&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futureworlds.eu/wiki/List_of_Future_Worlds_Center_Contracts&lt;/ref&gt;, employed more than 200 young scientists&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futureworlds.eu/wiki/Future_Worlds_Center#Future_Worlds_in_a_snapshot&lt;/ref&gt;, and founded several organizations, including [[CYBER KIDS]]&lt;ref&gt;www.cyber-kids.net CYBER KIDS Wiki&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;www.futureworlds.eu/wiki/CYBER_KIDS CYBER KIDS page at Future Worlds Wiki; previously named [[Cyprus Neuroscience and Technology Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Technology for peace]], the Cyprus Safer Internet Center along with the [[Cyprus Safer Internet Hotline]] and [[Cyprus Safer Internet Helpline| Helpline]], the Cyprus Community Media Centre&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cypruscommunitymedia.org Cyprus Community Media Centre Website&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the United Nations, Youth Power&lt;ref&gt;http://youthpowercyprus.org/about-us/member-organizations Youth Power website&lt;/ref&gt;, Cyprus NGO Platform "Development"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futureworlds.eu/wiki/CYINDEP:_Cyprus_NGO_Platform_%22Development%22 Cyprus NGO Platform "Development" page in Future Worlds Wiki&lt;/ref&gt;, the Cyprus Refugee Council&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/cyrefugeecouncil/ Cyprus Refugee Council in facebook&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Innovations in Education===
The organization has developed the curriculum for CYBER KIDS, a chain of computer learning centers, that started in Cyprus and expanded in 7 countries in the early 90s. CYBER KIDS was a mass-scale experiment to achieve massive social change in a whole country. 

Future Worlds Center also implements many EC-funded projects that conduct research and inform societies about the safer use of the Internet; Cyberethics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberethics.info the Cyprus’ Safer Internet Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Cyprus’ Safer Internet Center, which includes a [[Cyprus Safer Internet Hotline|Hotline]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberethics.info/cyethics2/page.php?pageID=15 Cyprus’ Safer Internet Hotline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110731064153/http://www.cyberethics.info/cyethics2/page.php?pageID=15 |date=2011-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Cyprus Safer Internet Helpline|Helpline]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helpline.cyberethics.info Cyprus’ Safer Internet Helpline] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120803204314/http://www.helpline.cyberethics.info/ |date=2012-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promoting regional peace===
Future Worlds Center  pioneers in envisioning, designing and implementing  projects that promote the culture of peace and reconciliation in Cyprus, the region and the globe.

'''George Frederick Barker''' (1835–1910) was an [[united States|American]] [[physician]] and [[scientist]]. He graduated from the [[Sheffield Scientific School|Yale Scientific School]] in 1858. He was successively chemical assistant in [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1858–1859 and 1860–1861, [[professor]] of [[chemistry]] and [[geology]] in [[Wheaton College, Illinois|Wheaton (Ill.) College]]. In 1864 he became the Professor of Natural Science at the Western University of Pennsylvania, now known as the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he undertook experiments to produce electric light by passing the current through a resisting filament which he claimed was "the first steady electric light generated in [[Pittsburgh]], if not in the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a805098m;didno=00a805098m;view=image;seq=11;node=00a805098m%3A2;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset; | title=History of the University of Pittsburgh| first=William Jacob | last=Holland | pages=8–10 | year=c. 1901 | accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently went to Yale as a professor of [[physiological chemistry]] and [[toxicology]], and later was a professor of [[physics]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], in 1879–1900, when he became [[emeritus]] professor.  He served as [[President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science|president]] of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1879; president of the [[American Chemical Society]]; vice-president of the [[American Philosophical Society]] for 10 years; a member of the [[United States Electrical Commission]]; and for several years an associate editor of the ''[[American Journal of Science]]''.  He lectured in many cities and wrote a ''Text-Book of Elementary Chemistry'' (1870); a ''Physics'' (1892); etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3187">The '''Hexateuch''' ("six scrolls") is the first six books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]:  the [[Torah]] (''[[Pentateuch]]'') and the [[book of Joshua]].&lt;ref name ="Harris"&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term ''Hexateuch'' came into scholarly use from the 1870s onwards mainly as the result of work carried out by [[Abraham Kuenen]] and [[Julius Wellhausen]].&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{Cite NIE |last=Schmidt |first=Nathaniel |authorlink=Nathaniel Schmidt |wstitle=Hexateuch |year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the work of [[Johann Gottfried Eichhorn|Eichhorn]], [[Wilhelm de Wette|de Wette]], [[Karl Heinrich Graf|Graf]], [[Abraham Kuenen|Kuenen]], [[Theodor Nöldeke|Nöldeke]], [[John William Colenso|Colenso]] and others, in his ''[[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels]]'' Wellhausen proposed that Joshua represented part of the northern [[Yahwist]] source (''c'' 950 BC), detached from  JE document by the [[Deuteronomist]] (''c'' 650&amp;ndash;621) and incorporated into the [[Deuteronomic history]], with the books of Judges, Kings, and Samuel.

Reasons for this unity, in addition to the presumed presence of the other documentary traditions, are taken from comparisons of the thematic concerns that underlie the narrative surface of the texts. For instance, the ''Book of Joshua'' stresses the continuity of leadership from [[Moses]] to Joshua. Furthermore the theme of ''Joshua'', the fulfillment of God's promise to lead the Israelites to the Promised Land, complements the thematic material of the Pentateuch, which had ended with the Israelites on the border of the Promised Land ready to enter.

The thesis that ''Joshua'' completes the ''Torah'' in a ''Hexateuch'' may be contrasted with the view of scholars following the older rabbinic tradition, as expressed by the compilers of the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] (compiled between 1901 and 1906), that the ''Pentateuch'' is a complete work in itself.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The thesis may also be contrasted with the view put forward by [[Eduard Meyer]] (1855–1930) that there never was any ''Hexateuch'' per se, but that the ''Law'', ''Joshua'', ''Judges'', ''Samuel'', and ''Kings'' once formed one great historic work.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10914">'''Horace Howard Furness Jayne''' (Cape May, New Jersey, 9 June 1898 &amp;ndash; 6 August 1975, Palm Beach, Florida) was an American museum director and curator, art historian, and expert on Asian art.

==Upbringing==
He was the son of [[University of Pennsylvania]] professor [[Horace Jayne]] and author [[Caroline Furness Jayne]], and the grandson and namesake of Shakespearean scholar [[Horace Howard Furness]]. He grew up in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Wallingford, Pennsylvania]], and attended [[Episcopal Academy]]. Both parents died when he was in his teens; afterward he and his sister Kate lived with their uncle Dr. [[William Henry Furness III]]. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1919, and was a member of its 1923-24 and 1925-26 archaeological expeditions to northwest China, sponsored by the [[Harvard Art Museums|Fogg Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Dilys P. Winegrad, ''Through Time, Across Continents: A Hundred Years of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University Museum'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum, 1993), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; He received a master's degree in art history from the University of Pennsylvania in 1933.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/02/archives/horace-jayne-77-art-curator-dies-exphiladelphia-and-met-aide-was.html "Horace Jayne, 77, Art Curator, Dies,"] ''The New York Times'', August 2, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duque Zhao Philadelphia 01.JPG|thumb|Reception Hall ({{circa}} 1640), Philadelphia Museum of Art.]]
He joined the staff of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] (PMA) in 1921, and was made curator of East Asian art in 1923.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt; He served as director of the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], 1929-1940; and as vice-director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1941-1949.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

During [[World War II]], he was a member of the [[Roberts Commission|American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas]], which provided the U.S. military with lists of and reports on cultural treasures in Europe and the Pacific Arena. The committee's recommendations led to creation of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments Men program]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monumentsmenfoundation.org/the-heroes/the-roberts-commission Roberts Commission], from Monuments Men Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. State Department]] took over the program in 1946, and Jayne was the first American civilian sent to China after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Staniforth, ''Historical Perspectives on Preventive Conservation'' (Getty Publications, 2013), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; He headed the China desk of [[Voice of America]], 1949-1953.&lt;ref name="StPeteobit"/&gt;

He returned to PMA in 1953 as acting chief of Eastern Art, and was named vice-director of the museum the following year.&lt;ref name="StPeteobit"/&gt; He retired from PMA in 1960, and moved to [[Seminole, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Peri Tucker, "Art Innovator Horace Jayne," ''The St. Petersburg Times'', June 10, 1962, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He was advisory curator at the [[Museum of Fine Arts (St. Petersburg, Florida)|Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], 1961-1966; and curator of Asian arts at the [[Norton Museum of Art]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] from 1966 to his death in 1975.&lt;ref name="StPeteobit"&gt;"Horace Jayne, Art Expert," ''The Evening Independent'' (St. Petersburg, Florida), August 4, 1975, p. 6-C.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum acquisitions===
The Philadelphia Museum of Art's massive new building opened in March 1928, but with only about a sixth of its planned galleries completed and open to the public.&lt;ref name="PMA2004"/&gt; That summer, director [[Fiske Kimball]] sent Jayne on a major buying trip to acquire architectural settings in which to exhibit PMA's East Asian art. In [[Nara Prefecture]], Japan, Jayne purchased a circa-1400 temple,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/165177.html?mulR=1980848054|1 Temple of the Attainment of Happiness], from Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Tokyo]], a traditional teahouse by architect Ōgi Rodō (1863&amp;ndash;1941).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/41886.html?mulR=1216177289|11 Ceremonial Teahouse Sunkaraku], from Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; In China, he purchased a circa-1775 scholar's study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/42577.html?mulR=1144848216|1 Scholar's Study], from Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; and a circa-1640 reception hall,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/42422.html?mulR=489599403|1 Reception Hall], from Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; both in [[Beijing]].
 
At age 31, Jayne became director of the University of Pennsylvania Museum, with its collection that focused on archaeology and anthropology. He and Kimball entered into a gentleman's agreement that they would not compete for artworks or artifacts. Each assessed his museum's collections, and exchanged objects that would build on the strengths of the other's holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Sozanski, [http://articles.philly.com/1986-11-20/news/26093442_1_art-museum-african-art-philadelphia-museum "A Museum Pact Breeds an Exhibit; Penn Holdings Will be Shown at Art Museum,"] ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', November 20, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reception Hall====
The late-[[Ming dynasty]] reception hall was from a minor palace outside the [[Forbidden City]].&lt;ref name="PMA2004"&gt;Adriana Proser, Sally Malenka &amp; Beth A. Price, "Painted Splendor: The Context and Conservation of a Chinese Reception Hall in the Philadelphia Museum of Art," ''Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin'', vol. 92, nos. 389-90 (Winter 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The palace was built by Wang Cheng'en, a [[eunuch]] and loyal attendant to the last Ming emperor, [[Chongzhen Emperor]] (reign: 1628-1644).{{efn|Research by PMA Assistant Curator of East Asian Art Adriana Proser, published in 2004, indicates that Jayne misidentified the reception hall's original owner in a 1929 article in ''The Pennsylvania Museum Bulletin''.&lt;ref&gt;Horace H. F. Jayne, "A Collection of Chinese Paintings Given with an Interior for Their Exhibition," ''The Pennsylvania Museum Bulletin'', vol. 24, no. 28 (May 1929), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This error was perpetuated for 75 years until corrected by Proser.&lt;ref name="PMA2004"/&gt;}} [[Li Zicheng]] and the [[Shun dynasty|Shun rebel army]] began their invasion of Beijing on April 24, 1644. The next day, the emperor and his imperial household committed suicide.&lt;ref name="PMA2004"/&gt;

The building was constructed of wood, but its columns rested upon stone footings and its roof was of tile. The interior of the main room &amp;ndash; 26&amp;nbsp;ft (7.92 m) tall, 45&amp;nbsp;ft (13.72 m) wide, and 35.5&amp;nbsp;ft (10.82 m) deep &amp;ndash; featured beams and carved brackets decorated with intricately painted animals, birds, flowers and [[Chinese characters]].&lt;ref name="PMA2004"/&gt; Much of its nearly-300-year-old painted decoration survived.

The building was disassembled, and the numbered pieces arrived in Philadelphia by ship in Summer 1929.&lt;ref name="PMA2004"/&gt; The [[Great Depression]] dealt a crippling blow to private fund-raising to finish the PMA interiors. Beginning in 1935, unemployed craftsmen were given work completing the galleries under the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]].&lt;ref name="PMA2004"/&gt; Reassembly of the reception hall began in 1937, and it was unveiled with the opening of the museum's Asian art wing in 1940.&lt;ref name="PMA2004"/&gt;

==Published works==
Jayne edited the letters of his grandfather, Horace Howard Furness. He wrote numerous articles for the ''Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin'', the ''University Museum Bulletin'', the ''Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', and other publications. He was co-editor (with [[Langdon Warner]] of the Fogg Art Museum) of ''Eastern Art'', a quarterly journal that debuted in 1930 and folded in 1931 after 5 issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/pacscl/ead.html?showall=sort&amp;fq=genre_form_facet%3A%22Correspondence%22&amp;id=PACSCL_PMA_PMA008 Langdon Warner records,''] from Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ignaz Paul Vital Troxler''' (August 17, 1780 – March 6, 1866) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[physician]], [[politician]], and [[philosopher]].

==Early life, education, and career==
Troxler was born in August 1780 in  [[Beromünster]], [[Switzerland]].  He studied in [[Jena]] and [[Göttingen]].  Among his teachers were [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]].  After earning his degree, he worked as a physician in [[Vienna]], where he befriended [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and married Wilhelmine Polborn. During that time, Troxler discovered a phenomenon of [[visual perception]] that now bears his name, [[Troxler's fading]].&lt;ref name="main"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804031720/http://www.troxlerforum.ch/| archivedate=August 4, 2007| deadurl=yes| title=Troxlerforum| url=http://www.troxlerforum.ch/| publisher=Hans U. Iselin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching and later life==
In 1811, he returned to Beromünster.  Troxler represented Switzerland at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.  In 1820 he became a professor for philosophy and history at the [[lyceum]] in [[Lucerne]] but had to leave after a year due to political problems. He founded an educational institution in [[Aarau]] and continued working as a physician.  In 1830, he returned to teaching, this time in [[Basel]]; but had to leave once again the next year due to political problems.  In 1832 he was elected to the legislative assembly of the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Aargau]].  He became a professor at the newly established [[University of Berne]] in 1834, where he stayed until 1850.

In 1848, Troxler succeeded in altering the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] to include elements of the [[United States Constitution]].

==Death==
Troxler died in March 6, 1866 in  Aarau, Switzerland, and is buried there.

The '''International Day of the Disappeared''', on August 30 of each year, is a day created to draw attention to the fate of individuals imprisoned at places and under poor conditions unknown to their relatives and/or legal representatives. The impulse for the day came from the [[Latin American Federation of Associations for Relatives of Detained-Disappeared]] ''(Federación Latinoamericana de Asociaciones de Familiares de Detenidos-Desaparecidos,'' or FEDEFAM), a [[non-governmental organization]] founded in 1981 in [[Costa Rica]] as an association of local and regional groups actively working against [[arbitrary arrest and detention|secret imprisonment]], [[forced disappearance]]s and [[kidnapping|abduction]] in a number of [[Latin America|Latin-American countries]].

Work on secret imprisonment is an important part of the activities for a number of international bodies and organizations in the fields of human rights activism and humanitarian aid, including for example [[Amnesty International]] (AI), the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC). The International Day of the Disappeared is an opportunity to highlight these institutions' work, [[raising awareness|increase public awareness]], and to call for donations and volunteers.

Of those agencies, the ICRC has additional privileges due to its special status as a non-governmental sovereign entity and its strict policy of neutrality. In some cases, the ICRC is the only institution granted access to specific groups of prisoners, thereby enabling a minimum level of contact and inspection of their treatment. For affected families, messages transmitted by the ICRC are often the only hint about the fate of these prisoners.

Visiting those detained in relation to conflicts and enabling them to [[Restoring Family Links|restore and maintain contact with their families]], is a very important part of the ICRC's mandate. But the definition of the Missing or the Disappeared goes far beyond the victims of enforced disappearance.   It includes all those whose families have lost contact as the result of conflicts, natural disasters or other tragedies.  

These missing may be detained, stranded in foreign countries, hospitalized or dead.  Through its tracing services and working with the 189 national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world, the ICRC seeks to obtain information about their fate on behalf of their families.   It reminds governments and other groups of their obligations to respect the families' right to know the fate of their loved ones.  It also works with families of the missing to help them address their particular psychological, social legal and financial needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2013/08-28-disappeared-missing.htm Families of missing people need better support]&lt;/ref&gt;

Imprisonment under secret or uncertain circumstances is a grave violation of some conceptions of [[human rights]] as well as, in the case of an armed conflict, of [[International Humanitarian Law]]. The [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] adopted a [[Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance]] as resolution 47/133 on December 18, 1992. It is estimated that secret imprisonment is practiced in about 30 countries. The OHCHR Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has registered about 46,000 cases of people who disappeared under unknown circumstances.

On August 30, 2007, hundreds of [[Philippine]] relatives and supporters of desaparecidos, mostly activists, missing after being abducted or killed by Philippine security forces protested against the government to mark International Day of the Disappeared. Edita Burgos remembered her missing son, Jonas, a member of the Peasants' Movement of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/30/asia/AS-GEN-Philippines-Day-of-the-Disappeared.php  ITH, Hundreds protest in Philippines against abductions]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, 2008 the [[International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances]], which gathers family member organizations and human rights organizations from around the world, joined hands for a global campaign event to promote the ratification of the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]].

'''Jean-François Lyotard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|j|ɔː|t|ɑːr}}; {{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ fʁɑ̃swa ljɔtaʁ|lang}}; 10 August 1924 – 21 April 1998) was a [[French people|French]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Sociology|sociologist]], and [[Literary theory|literary theorist]]. His interdisciplinary discourse spans such topics as [[epistemology]] and communication, the human body, [[modern art]] and [[postmodern art]], literature and [[critical theory]], music, film, time and memory, space, the city and landscape, the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], and the relation between [[aesthetics]] and [[politics]]. He is best known for his articulation of [[Postmodernism#Jean-Fran.C3.A7ois Lyotard|postmodernism]] after the late 1970s and the analysis of the impact of [[postmodernity]] on the [[human condition]]. He was a director of the [[International College of Philosophy]] which was founded by [[Jacques Derrida]], [[François Châtelet]], [[Jean-Pierre Faye]] and [[Dominique Lecourt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benoit |first1=Peeters |title=Derrida: A Biography |date=2013 |publisher=Polity |location=London |isbn=9780745656151 |page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

=== Early life, educational background, and family ===

Jean François Lyotard was born on August 10, 1924 in [[Vincennes]], France to Jean-Pierre Lyotard, a sales representative, and Madeleine Cavalli. He went to primary school at the Paris [[Lycée Buffon]] and [[Louis-le-Grand]]. As a child, Lyotard had many aspirations: to be an artist, a historian, a Dominican monk, and a writer. He later gave up the dream of becoming a writer when he finished writing an unsuccessful fictional novel at the age of 15.&lt;ref name="Sica, Alan 2005"&gt;Sica, Alan. 2005, "Jean Francois Lyotard." ''Social thought: from the Enlightenment to the present''. Boston: Pearson/Allyn and Bacon, 682.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Lyotard describes the realization that he would not become any of these occupations as "fate" in his intellectual biography called ''Peregrinations'',&lt;ref name="Sica, Alan 2005"/&gt; published in 1988.

He studied philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in the late 1940s. His 1947 DES thesis (''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'', roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis), ''Indifference as an Ethical Concept'' (''L'indifférence comme notion éthique''), analyzed forms of indifference and detachment in [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Stoicism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Epicureanism]].&lt;ref name="Schrift p. 161"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, ''The Work of Mourning'', ed. Pascale-Anne Brault and Michael Naas, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Lyotard took up a position teaching philosophy in [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] in [[French Algeria]] but returned to mainland France in 1952 to teach at the Prytanée military academy in La Flèche, where he wrote a short work on [[Phenomenology]], published in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bamford |first1=Kiff |title=Jean-Francois Lyotard |date=2017 |publisher=Reaktion |location=London |isbn=9781780238081| page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lyotard moved to Paris in 1959 to teach at the Sorbonne: introductory lectures from this time (1964) have been posthumously published under the title ''Why Philosophize?''.       Having moved to teach at the new campus of Nanterre in 1966, Lyotard participated in the events following March 22 and the tumult of May 1968. In 1971, Lyotard earned a [[State doctorate]] with his dissertation ''[[Discourse, Figure|Discours, figure]]'' under [[Mikel Dufrenne]]—the work was published the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, ''The Work of Mourning'', ed. Pascale-Anne Brault and Michael Naas, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyotard joined the Philosophy department of the experimental University at Vincennes, later Paris 8, together with Gilles Deleuze, in the academic year 1970-71; it remained his academic home in France until 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bamford |first1=Kiff |title=Jean-Francois Lyotard: Critical Lives |date=2017 |publisher=Reaktion |location=London |isbn=9781780238081 |page=64-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married his first wife, Andrée May, in 1948 with whom he had two children, Corinne and Laurence, and later married for a second time in 1993 to Dolores Djidzek, the mother of his son David (born in 1986).&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, ''The Work of Mourning'', ed. Pascale-Anne Brault and Michael Naas, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 211-213.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political life===

In 1954, Lyotard became a member of ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'', a French political organisation formed in 1948 around the inadequacy of the [[Trotskyist]] analysis to explain the new forms of domination in the [[Soviet Union]]. ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'' had an objective to conduct a [[critique of Marxism]] from within during the Algerian war of liberation. His writings in this period mostly concern with [[Far-left politics#Ultra-leftism|ultra-left politics]], with a focus on the Algerian situation—which he witnessed first-hand while teaching philosophy in Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lyotard |first= Jean-François |title="The Name of Algeria" in ''Political Writings'' | publisher=UCL Press | year=1993 | pages=165–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote optimistic essays of hope and encouragement to the Algerians, which was reproduced in Political Writings.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Anthony, and Larry J. Ray. "Jean Francois Lyotard." Key contemporary social theorists.2003.Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyotard hoped to encourage an Algerian fight for independence from France, and a [[social revolution]]. Following disputes with [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] in 1964, Lyotard left ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'' for the newly formed [[splinter group]] ''Pouvoir Ouvrier'', before resigning from ''Pouvoir Ouvrier'' in turn in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lefort |first= Claude |authorlink=Claude Lefort |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1977 | issue=30|pages=177}} Cf. http://www.iep.utm.edu/lyotard/.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lyotard played an active part in the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]] uprisings, he distanced himself from [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary Marxism]] with his 1974 book ''[[Libidinal Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bennington, ''Lyotard: Writing the Event'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1988, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He distanced himself from Marxism because he felt that Marxism had a rigid [[Structuralism|structuralist]] approach and they were imposing 'systematization of desires' through strong emphasis on industrial production as the ground culture.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Doug. ''Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory''. Oxford University Press. 2008. pp. 257–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic career===
Lyotard taught at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée d'Aumale|fr|3=Lycée d'Aumale (Constantine)|lt=Lycée of Constantine}}, Algeria&lt;ref name="Schrift p. 161"/&gt; from 1950 to 1952. In 1972, Lyotard began teaching at the [[University of Paris VIII]]; he taught there until 1987 when he became Professor Emeritus. During the next two decades he lectured outside France, notably as a Professor of [[Critical theory#Postmodern critical theory|Critical Theory]] at the [[University of California, Irvine]] and as visiting professor at universities around the world. These included: [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Yale University]], [[Stony Brook University]] and the [[University of California, San Diego]] in the U.S., the [[Université de Montréal]] in [[Quebec]] (Canada), and the [[University of São Paulo]] in Brazil. He was also a founding director and council member of the [[Collège International de Philosophie]], Paris. Before his death, he split his time between Paris and Atlanta, where he taught at [[Emory University]] as the Woodruff Professor of Philosophy and French.

==Work==

Lyotard's work is characterised by a persistent opposition to [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], [[meta-narrative]]s, and generality. He is fiercely critical of many of the 'universalist' claims of [[the Enlightenment]], and several of his works serve to undermine the fundamental principles that generate these broad claims.

In his writings of the early 1970s, he [[Social rejection|rejects]] what he regards as theological underpinnings of both [[Karl Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]: "In Freud, it is judaical,&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; critical sombre (forgetful of the political); in Marx it is catholic.&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; [[Hegelian]], reconciliatory (...) in the one and in the other the relationship of the economic with meaning is blocked in the category of representation (...) Here a politics, there a therapeutics, in both cases a laical theology, on top of the arbitrariness and the roaming of forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lyotard |first=Jean-François |title=Adorno as the Devil | journal=Telos | year=1974 | issue=19|pages=134–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, he rejected [[Theodor W. Adorno]]'s negative [[dialectics]] because he viewed them as seeking a "therapeutic resolution in the framework of a religion, here the religion of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lyotard |first=Jean-François |title=Adorno as the Devil | journal=Telos | year=1974 | issue=19|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lyotard's "libidinal economics" he aimed at "discovering and describing different social modes of investment of libidinal intensities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hurley |first=Robert |title=Introduction to Lyotard | journal=Telos | year=1974 | issue=19|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Postmodern Condition''===
Lyotard is a skeptic for modern cultural thought. According to his ''[[The Postmodern Condition|La Condition postmoderne: Rapport sur le savoir (The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge)]]'' (1979), the impact of the postmodern condition was to provoke [[skepticism]] about universalizing theories. Lyotard argues that we have outgrown our needs for ''[[grand narratives]]'' due to the advancement of techniques and technologies since [[World War II]]. He argues against the possibility of justifying the narratives that bring together disciplines and social practices, such as science and culture; "the narratives we tell to justify a single set of laws and stakes are inherently unjust."&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;Williams, James. 2002. "Jean-Francois Lyotard", pp. 210–214, in ''Key Contemporary Social Theorists'' by Anthony Elliott and Larry Ray. Oxford, Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[faith|loss of faith]] in [[metanarrative|meta-narratives]] has an effect on how we view science, art, and literature. Little narratives have now become the appropriate way for explaining [[social transformation]]s and [[Social conflict|political problems]]. Lyotard argues that this is the driving force behind postmodern science. As metanarratives fade, science suffers a loss of faith in its search for [[truth]], and therefore must find other ways of legitimating its efforts. Connected to this scientific legitimacy is the growing dominance for [[computer|information machines]]. Lyotard argues that one day, in order for knowledge to be considered useful, it will have to be converted into [[Data (computing)|computerized data]]. Years later, this led him into writing his book ''The Inhuman'', published in 1988, in which he illustrates a world where technology has taken over.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Noel and Sim, Stuart. 1997. "Lyotard, Jean Francois (1924–)", pp. 205–208, in ''The A-Z Guide to Modern Social and Political Theorists'', Prentice Hall/Harvester Wheatsheaf.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The collapse of the "grand narrative" and "language-games"===

Most famously, in ''[[The Postmodern Condition|La Condition postmoderne: Rapport sur le savoir (The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge)]]'' (1979), he proposes what he calls an extreme simplification of the "postmodern" as an 'incredulity towards meta-narratives'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lyotard |first= Jean-François |title=La Condition Postmoderne: Rapport sur le Savoir | publisher=Les Editions de Minuit | year=1979 | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These meta-narratives—sometimes 'grand narratives'—are grand, large-scale theories and philosophies of the world, such as the [[Progress (history)|progress of history]], the [[Knowledge#Scientific knowledge|knowability of everything by science]], and the possibility of [[Nirvana|absolute freedom]]. Lyotard argues that we have ceased to believe that narratives of this kind are adequate to represent and contain us all. He points out that [[Consensus reality|no one seemed to agree on what, if anything, was real]] and everyone had their own perspective and story.&lt;ref&gt;Lemert, Charles C.. "After Modern." Social theory: the multicultural and classic readings.1993. Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press, 456.&lt;/ref&gt; We have become alert to difference, diversity, the incompatibility of our aspirations, beliefs and desires, and for that reason postmodernity is characterised by an abundance of micronarratives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://athome.harvard.edu/programs/nagy/threads/micronarratives.html Micronarratives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629164313/http://athome.harvard.edu/programs/nagy/threads/micronarratives.html |date=2011-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this concept Lyotard draws from the notion of '[[language-games]]' found in the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Lyotard notes that it is based on mapping of society according to the concept of the language games.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Anthony, and Larry J. Ray. "Jean Francois Lyotard." Key contemporary social theorists. 2003. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lyotard's works, the term 'language games', sometimes also called 'phrase regimens', denotes the [[Multiculturalism|multiplicity of communities]] of meaning, the innumerable and incommensurable separate systems in which meanings are produced and rules for their circulation are created.&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-François (1984). ''The Postmodern Condition.'' 1st ed. Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]], Print. pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; This involves, for example, an incredulity towards the metanarrative of [[human emancipation]]. That is, the story of how the human race has set itself free that brings together the language game of science, the language game of human historical conflicts and the language game of human qualities into the overall justification of the steady development of the human race in terms of wealth and moral [[well-being]]. According to this metanarrative, the justification of science is related to wealth and education. The development of history is seen as a steady [[Progress (history)#Types|progress towards civilization or moral well-being]]. The language game of human passions, qualities and [[Vice#Etymology|faults]] (c.f. [[Character flaw|character flaws (narratives)]]), is seen as steadily shifting in favor of our qualities and away from our faults as science and historical developments help us [[Positive psychology#Strengths and virtues|to conquer our faults in favor of our qualities]]. The point is that any event ought to be able to be understood in terms of the justifications of this metanarrative; anything that happens can be understood and judged according to the discourse of human emancipation. For example, for any new social, political or scientific revolution we could ask the question, "Is this revolution a step towards the greater [[well-being]] of [[Mass society|the mass of human beings]]?" It should always be possible to answer this question in terms of the rules of justification of the metanarrative of human emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, James (1998). ''Lyotard: Toward a Postmodern Philosophy.'' Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers Inc, Print. p.32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

This becomes more crucial in ''Au juste: Conversations (Just Gaming)'' (1979) and ''Le Différend ([[The Differend]])'' (1983), which develop a postmodern theory of justice. It might appear that the atomisation of human beings implied by the notion of the micronarrative and the language game suggests a collapse of ethics. It has often been thought that universality is a condition for something to be a properly ethical statement: 'thou shalt not steal' is an ethical statement in a way that 'thou shalt not steal from Margaret' is not. The latter is too particular to be an ethical statement (what's so special about Margaret?); it is only ethical if it rests on a universal statement ('thou shalt not steal from anyone'). But universals are impermissible in a world that has lost faith in metanarratives, and so it would seem that ethics is impossible. Justice and injustice can only be terms within language games, and the universality of ethics is out of the window. Lyotard argues that notions of justice and injustice do in fact remain in postmodernism. The new definition of injustice is indeed to use the language rules from one 'phrase regimen' and apply them to another. Ethical behaviour is about remaining alert precisely to the threat of this injustice, about paying attention to things in their particularity and not enclosing them within abstract conceptuality. One must bear witness to the 'differend.' In a differend, there is a conflict between two parties that cannot be solved in a just manner. However, the act of being able to bridge the two and understand the claims of both parties, is the first step towards finding a solution.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I would like to call a differend the case where the plaintiff is divested of the means to argue and becomes for that reason a victim. If the addressor, the addressee, and the sense of the testimony are neutralized, everything takes place as if there were no damages. A case of differend between two parties takes place when the regulation of the conflict that opposes them is done in the idiom of one of the parties while the wrong suffered by the other is not signified in that idiom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lyotard |first= Jean-François |title= The Differend: Phrases in Dispute | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | year=1988 | pages=9 |isbn= 0-8166-1610-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In more than one book, Lyotard promoted what he called [[paganism]] and contrasted it with both the rejection of the pagan gods in Book II of [[Plato]]'s [[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]] and the [[monotheism]] of [[Judaism]]. Lyotard argued that the pagan gods, unlike Platonic philosophy and monotheism, never claimed to have universal truth, but instead were better than humans because they were better at deceit and metamorphosis. Lyotard's paganism was also [[feminist]] because he argued that women, like paganism, are antirational and antiphilosophical.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hsUJPyH_z-sC&amp;pg=PA29 The Ennobling of Democracy: The Challenge of the Postmodern Age] p. 29-31]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Differend''===

In ''[[The Differend]]'', based on [[Immanuel Kant]]'s views on the separation of Understanding, Judgment, and Reason, Lyotard identifies the moment in which language fails as the differend, and explains it as follows: "...the unstable state and instant of language wherein something which must be able to be put into phrases cannot yet be… the human beings who thought they could use language as an instrument of communication, learn through the feeling of pain which accompanies silence (and of pleasure which accompanies the invention of a new idiom)".&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-François (1988). ''The Differend: Phrases in Dispute.'' Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, Print. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyotard undermines the common view that the meanings of phrases can be determined by what they refer to (the referent). The meaning of a phrase—an event (something happens)--cannot be fixed by appealing to reality (what actually happened). Lyotard develops this view of language by defining "reality" in an original way, as a complex of possible senses attached to a referent through a name. The correct sense of a phrase cannot be determined by a reference to reality, since the referent itself does not fix sense, and reality itself is defined as the complex of competing senses attached to a referent. Therefore, the phrase event remains indeterminate.

Lyotard uses the example of Auschwitz and the revisionist historian Faurisson’s demands for proof of the Holocaust to show how the differend operates as a double bind (a dilemma or difficult circumstance from which there is no escape because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions). Faurisson will only accept proof of the existence of gas chambers from eyewitnesses who were themselves victims of the gas chambers. However, any such eyewitnesses are dead and are not able to testify. Either there were no gas chambers, in which case there would be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence, or there were gas chambers, in which case there would still be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence, because they would be dead. Since Faurisson will accept no evidence for the existence of gas chambers, except the testimony of actual victims, he will conclude from both possibilities (gas chambers existed and gas chambers did not exist) that gas chambers did not exist. This presents a double bind. There are two alternatives, either there were gas chambers or there were not, which lead to the same conclusion: there were no gas chambers (and no final solution).&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-François (1988). ''The Differend: Phrases in Dispute.'' Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, Print. pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The case is a differend because the harm done to the victims cannot be presented in the standard of judgement upheld by Faurisson.

===The sublime===
Lyotard was a frequent writer on [[aesthetic]] matters. He was, despite his reputation as a postmodernist, a great promoter of [[modernist art]]. Lyotard saw [[postmodernism]] as a latent tendency within thought throughout time and not a narrowly limited historical period. He favoured the startling and perplexing works of the high modernist avant-garde. In them he found a demonstration of the limits of our conceptuality, a valuable lesson for anyone too imbued with Enlightenment confidence. Lyotard has written extensively also on many contemporary artists of his choice: [[Valerio Adami]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jacques Monory]], [[Ruth Francken]], [[Shusaku Arakawa]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Karel Appel]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[René Guiffrey]], [[Gianfranco Baruchello]] and [[Albert Ayme]] as well as on earlier artists, notably [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Paul Klee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lyotard |first1=Jean-Francois |title=Writings on Contemporary Art and Artists |date=2009-2013 |publisher=Leuven University Press |isbn=9789058678867 |edition=7 volumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He developed these themes in particular by discussing the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The "sublime" is a term in aesthetics whose fortunes revived under postmodernism after a century or more of neglect. It refers to the experience of pleasurable anxiety that we experience when confronting wild and threatening sights like, for example, a massive craggy mountain, black against the sky, looming terrifyingly in our vision. A sublime is the conjunction of two opposed feelings, which makes it harder for us to see the injustice of it, or a solution to it.

Lyotard found particularly interesting the explanation of the sublime offered by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' (sometimes ''Critique of the Power of Judgment''). In this book, Kant explains this mixture of anxiety and pleasure in the following terms: there are two kinds of 'sublime' experience. In the 'mathematically' sublime, an object strikes the mind in such a way that we find ourselves unable to take it in as a whole. More precisely, we experience a clash between our reason (which tells us that all objects are finite) and the imagination (the aspect of the mind that organizes what we see, and which sees an object incalculably larger than ourselves, and feels infinite). In the 'dynamically' sublime, the mind recoils at an object so immeasurably more powerful than we, whose weight, force, scale could crush us without the remotest hope of our being able to resist it. (Kant stresses that if we are in ''actual'' danger, our feeling of anxiety is very different from that of a sublime feeling. The sublime is an aesthetic experience, not a practical feeling of personal danger.) This explains the feeling of anxiety.

What is deeply unsettling about the mathematically sublime is that the mental faculties that present visual perceptions to the mind are inadequate to the concept corresponding to it; in other words, what we are able to make ourselves see cannot fully match up to what we know is there. We know it's a mountain but we cannot take the whole thing into our perception. Our sensibility is incapable of coping with such sights, but our reason can assert the finitude of the presentation.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} With the dynamically sublime, our sense of physical danger should prompt an awareness that we are not just physical material beings, but moral and (in Kant's terms) [[noumenal]] beings as well. The body may be dwarfed by its power but our reason need not be. This explains, in both cases, why the sublime is an experience of pleasure as well as pain.

Lyotard is fascinated by this admission, from one of the philosophical architects of the Enlightenment, that the mind cannot always organise the world rationally. Some objects are simply incapable of being brought neatly under concepts. For Lyotard, in ''[[Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime]]'', but drawing on his argument in ''The Differend'', this is a good thing. Such generalities as 'concepts' fail to pay proper attention to the particularity of things. What happens in the sublime is a crisis where we realise the inadequacy of the imagination and reason to each other. What we are witnessing, says Lyotard, is actually the differend; the straining of the mind at the edges of itself and at the edges of its conceptuality.

===''Libidinal Economy''===

In one of Lyotard's most famous books, ''[[Libidinal Economy]]'' he offers a critique of Marx’s "false consciousness" and claims that the 19th century working class enjoyed being a part of the industrialization process. Lyotard claims that this is due to libidinal energy. The term "libidinal" coming from the term ''[[libido]]'' which is used to refer to the psychoanalytical desires of our deeper consciousness. Lyotard’s writings in ''[[Libidinal Economy]]'' is an achievement in our attempts to live with the rejection of all religious and moral principles through an undermining of the structures associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;Lemert, Charles. 2013. "The Idea of the Postmodern" Pp. 465–468 in Social Theory: The Multicultural, Global, and Classic Readings, Westview Press. Boulder, CO.&lt;/ref&gt; Structures conceal libidinal intensities while intense feelings and desires force us away from set structures. However, there also can be no intensities or desires without structures, because there would be no dream of escaping the repressive structures if they do not exist. "Libidinal energy comes from this disruptive intervention of external events within structures that seek order and self-containment."&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; This was the first of Lyotard's writings that had really criticized a Marxist view. It achieved great success, but was also the last of Lyotard's writings on this particular topic where he really went against the views of [[Karl Marx]].

===''Les Immatériaux''===
In 1985, Lyotard co-curated the exhibition ''Les Immatériaux'' at the Centre de Création Industrielle of [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris, together with the design theorist and curator [[Thierry Chaput]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Y. Hui and A. Broeckmann, ''30 Years after Les Immatériaux'', meson press, Lüneburg, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Grip'': Childhood and mancipium===
Lyotard was impressed by the importance of childhood in human life,&lt;ref&gt;J-F Lyotard, ''The Postmodern Explained to Children'' (London 1992) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; which he saw as providing the opportunity of creativity, as opposed to the settled [[hubris]] of maturity.&lt;ref name="Rereading Jean-Francois Lyotard 2016 p 142"&gt;R Shields ed., ''Rereading Jean-Francois Lyotard'' (2016) p 142&lt;/ref&gt;  In 'The Grip', however, he also explored the hold of childhood experience on the individual through the (Roman) concept of the [[wikt:mancipium|Mancipium]], or authoritative right of possession.&lt;ref name="Rereading Jean-Francois Lyotard 2016 p 142"/&gt; Because parental influences affect the new-born before it has the linguistic skill even to articulate – let alone oppose – them, Lyotard considered that "We are born from others but also to others, given over defenceless to them. Subject to their ''mancipium''."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in K Still ed., ''Minima Memoria'' (Stanford 2007) p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==

Some of the latest works that Lyotard had been working on were both writings about a French writer, activist, and politician, [[André Malraux]]. One of them being a biography, ''Signed, Malraux''. Lyotard was interested in the aesthetic views of society that Malraux shared. Lyotard's other book was named ''The Confession of Augustine'' and was a study in the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of time. This work-in-progress was published posthumously in the same year of Lyotard's death.

Lyotard repeatedly returned to the notion of the Postmodern in essays gathered in English as ''The Postmodern Explained to Children'', ''Toward the Postmodern'', and ''Postmodern Fables''. In 1998, while preparing for a conference on [[postmodernism]] and [[media theory]], he died unexpectedly from a case of [[leukemia]] that had advanced rapidly. He is buried in Division 6 of [[Le Père Lachaise Cemetery|Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tomb of Jean-François Lyotard|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Grave_of_Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Lyotard|accessdate=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

There are three major criticisms of Lyotard's work. Each coincides with a school of thought. [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] have written [[deconstruction]]s of Lyotard's work (Derrida 1992; Nancy 1985).&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques. 2005. ''On Touching, Jean-Luc-Nancy'', Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They focus on Lyotard's postmodern work and on ''The Differend'' in particular. A differend depends upon a distinction drawn between groups that itself depends upon the heterogeneity of [[language game]]s and genres of discourse. Why should these differences be privileged over an endless division and reconstruction of groups? In concentrating on specific differences, Lyotard's thought becomes overly dependent on differences; between categories that are given as fixed and well defined. From the point of view of deconstruction, Lyotard's philosophy gives too much credit to illegitimate categories and groups. Underlying any different there is a multiplicity of further differences; some of these will involve crossing the first divide, others will question the integrity of the groups that were originally separated.&lt;ref name="Elliott, Anthony 2003"&gt;Elliott, Anthony, and Larry J. Ray. "Jean Francois Lyotard." Key contemporary social theorists.2003. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manfred Frank]] (1988) has put the [[Frankfurt School]] criticism best. It attacks Lyotard's search for division over consensus on the grounds that it involves a philosophical mistake with serious political and social repercussions. Lyotard has failed to notice that an underlying condition for consensus is also a condition for the successful communication of his own thought. It is a [[performative contradiction]] to give an account that appeals to our reason on behalf of a difference that is supposed to elude it. So, in putting forward a false argument against a rational consensus, Lyotard plays into the hands of the irrational forces that often give rise to injustice and differ ends. Worse, he is then only in a position to testify to that injustice, rather than put forward a just and rational resolution.&lt;ref name="Elliott, Anthony 2003"/&gt;

From a [[Nietzschean]] and [[Deleuzian]] point of view (James Williams 2000), Lyotard's postmodern philosophy took a turn toward a destructive modern [[nihilism]] that his early work avoids. The different and the sublime are negative terms that introduce a severe pessimism at the core of Lyotard's philosophy. Both terms draw lines that cannot be crossed and yet they mark the threshold of that which is most valuable for the philosophy, that which is to be testified to and its proper concern. It is not possible repetitively to lend an ear to the sublime without falling into despair due to its fleeting nature. Whenever we try to understand or even memorize: the activity of testimony through the sublime, it can only be as something that has now dissipated and that we cannot capture.&lt;ref name="Elliott, Anthony 2003"/&gt;

Charles J. Stivale, of Wayne State University, wrote a critique of Lyotard's ''The Differend'' for ''The French Review'', in 1990. In it, he states: "Jean-François Lyotard's is a dense work of philosophical, political and ethical reflection aimed at a specialized audience versed in current debates in logic, pragmatics and post-structuralism. Even George Van Den Abbeele's excellent translation, complete with a glossary of French terms not available in the original text (Paris: Minuit, 1983), does not, indeed cannot, alleviate the often terse prose with which Lyotard develops his reasoning. With this said, I must also observe that this work is of vital importance in a period when revisionism of all stripes attempts to rewrite, and often simply deny, the occurrence of historical and cultural events, i.e. in attempting to reconstruct 'reality" in the convenient names of "truth" and "common sense" … This overview must leave unexplored the broad philosophical bases from which Lyotard draws support, as well as important questions that he raises regarding history, justice and critical judgement. I can conclude only by suggesting that this work, despite the formidable difficulties inherent to its carefully articulated arguments, offers readers a rich formulation of precise questions for and about the current period of critical transition and re-opening in philosophy, ethics and aesthetics."&lt;ref&gt;Stivale, Charles J (1990). "The French Review." Print. Pp. 722–723.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The collective tribute to Lyotard following his death was organized by the Collège International de Philosophie, and chaired by Dolores Lyotard and [[Jean-Claude Milner]], the College's director at that time. The proceedings were published by PUF in 2001 under the general title ''Jean-François Lyotard, l'exercice du différend''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badiou |first=Alain |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Pocket Pantheon: Figures of Postwar Philosophy |date=July 2009  |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |publisher= Verso|location= |language=|isbn=978-1-84467-357-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=193 |chapter=A Note on the Texts |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyotard's work continues to be important in [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[sociology]], [[literature]], [[art]], and [[cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Anthony, and Larry J. Ray. "Jean Francois Lyotard." Key contemporary social theorists.2003. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; To mark the tenth anniversary of Lyotard's death, An international symposium about Jean-François Lyotard organized by the [[Collège International de Philosophie]] (under the direction of Dolores Lyotard, Jean-Claude Milner and Gerald Sfez) was held in Paris from January 25–27 in 2007.

'''Jesús Ballesteros''' (born 1943 in [[Valencia]]) is a Spanish philosopher and jurist.

==Education==
In 1965, he obtained his law degree, earning the highest qualifications. In 1971, he obtained a doctoral degree from the [[University of Valencia]] after defending a thesis about Giuseppe Capograssi.

==Career==
Since 1983 he has been teaching [[Philosophy of Law]] and [[Political Philosophy]] at the University of Valencia School of Law.

During this time, he combined academic activities with research. He mentored 21 doctoral theses along with 39 dissertations. His presence  was requested on many national and international seminars which have taken place in Germany, Colombia, Spain, Italy and Mexico.

He is currently a member of the Spanish Society of Judicial and Political Philosophy, the Spanish Society of Bioethics, and a member of the Assessment Council on the journals Anuario de Derechos Humanos, Persona y Derecho, Cuadernos de Bioética, Ragion Pratica, Rivista di Filosofia del Diritto y Teoria del diritto e dello Stato. He has also been a member of the Real Academy on Valencian Culture.

==Thought==
His books intend to shake the reader and trigger new thoughts about current issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.unav.es/dspace/bitstream/10171/19045/1/32473755.pdf |title=Jesus Ballesteros : March 2006 |publisher=Dspace.unav.es |language=es |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work manifests his concerns about the recent challenges human beings have faced and how to solve them. He offers an alternative position against the prevailing, [[neo-nietzschean]] [[post-structuralist]] mindset. He emphasizes the value of reason that remains close to reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Postmodernity and Decadence'', Pamplona, Universidad de Navarra, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s he investigated [[political ecology]]. During the decade he considered [[bioethics]] in terms of the new possibilities of [[biotechnology]]. In the first decade of the new century he extended his interest in human rights and the defense of human dignity, writing about the problem of war and intercultural dialogue.

He studied a wide field of philosophy of law and political philosophical issues: foundation of [[human rights]], forms of [[violence]], issues on [[ecology]] from a [[political ecology]] perspective, the ethical problems of [[biotechnology]], [[feminism]] and the possibilities of [[postmodernity]]. Currently he studies the global roots of the economic and financial crisis.  Among other works, he edited a book on [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]].&lt;ref&gt;“Globalisation: from chrematistic rest to humanist wakefulness” en Globalization and human rights : challenges and answers from a European perspective,  Dordrecht, Springer, 2012, pp. 3–26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He is the father of seven children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4174">'''Kalim Siddiqui, Ph.D.''' (15 September 1931) was a [[Pakistani]] [[United Kingdom|British]] writer and [[Islamic]] [[activist]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary--kalim-siddiqui-1305799.html Obituary: The Independent]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life==
Siddiqui was born in the village of Dondi Lohara, [[Central Provinces and Berar|CP]], [[British India]] on 15 September 1931. He became increasing involved in politics as a teenager, when during a small demonstration close to his home town a bullet fired by a British soldier barely missed him, killing the youth behind him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimedia.com/archives/world98/kalim.htm Obituary: Kalim Siddiqui&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After the creation of the state of [[Pakistan]] he briefly joined the [[Khilafat Movement]] in [[Karachi]] and became the editor of its newspaper, ''The Independent Leader''. Along with other members of the movement, he moved to London in the early 1950s. In the mid 1960s he put himself through college and university, taking a degree in [[Economics]] and then, in 1972, a [[PhD]] in [[International Relations]] from [[University College, London]]. He founded the Muslim Institute for Research and Planning in [[London]] in 1972 and campaigned through his writings for [[political Islam]].&lt;ref name="BangashPower"&gt;Zafar Bangash, Introduction to In Pursuit of the Power of Islam, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporting Iran==
He publicly declared his support for the [[Islamic Revolution in Iran]] of 1979, and was later a defender of Ayatullah Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie.{{Citation needed|date= October 2011}}

==The Muslim Parliament==
In 1989 he founded the [[Muslim Parliament]] of [[Great Britain]]. Although activism was certainly a major part of his life, the core of his work was a unique analysis, understanding and exposition of Muslim history and the contemporary situation facing Muslims which he developed and presented in a series of major writings and speeches. He died in [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]] on 18 April 1996, after attending the International Conference on Creating a New Civilization of Islam.&lt;ref name="BangashPower" /&gt; He was an outspoken force in the need for an integrated body of Muslims which could exercise communal interests (the regulation of [[halal]] meat and the sighting of the [[Ramadhan|Ramadan moon]]) and act as a lobbying body in the wider British community, like the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]].{{Citation needed|date= October 2011}}

From his root guru, His Holiness Dharmaraja [[Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche|Jigmey Phuntsok Rinpoche]], he received numerous teachings of both [[Sutrayana]] and [[Tantrayana]], as well as many direct transmissions of tantric pith instructions. After having earned the title "Khenpo" conferred by His Holiness, he took part in the teachings at the Institute and was responsible for educating the Tibetan [[Sangha]] for nine years.  In 1996, he was entrusted by his Holiness to devote himself to the education of Chinese-speaking monastics.  

Today, Khenpo still resides at the Institute to teach and guide both the monastics and lay practitioners, implementing the study and practice of [[bodhicitta]], [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajna]] (wisdom), [[Pure Land]] Practice, [[Lamrim]] (stages of the path to enlightenment), the Five Treatises of [[Maitreya]], and other tantric and [[Mahayana]] teachings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27712">This is a list of people whose ideas became part of [[Nazi ideology]]. The ideas, writings, and speeches of these thinkers were incorporated into what became [[Nazism]], including  [[antisemitism]], [[eugenics]], [[racial hygiene]], the concept of the [[master race]], and [[Lebensraum]]. The list includes people whose ideas were incorporated, even if they did not live in the Nazi era.

==Philosophers and sociologists==
* [[Alfred Baeumler]] (1887–1968), German philosopher in Nazi Germany. He was a leading interpreter of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s philosophy as legitimizing Nazism. [[Thomas Mann]] read Baeumler's work on Nietzsche in the early 1930s, and characterized passages of it as "Hitler prophecy."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mann und Alfred Baeumler, Würzburg: Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 1989, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Alfred Rosenberg]] (1893–1946), considered one of the main authors of key Nazi ideological creeds, including the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]], antisemitism, Lebensraum, abrogation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and opposition to [[degenerate art]]. He is also known for his rejection of [[Christianity]], while playing a role in the development of [[Positive Christianity]]. At Nuremberg he was tried, sentenced to death, and executed by hanging as a war criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889–1976), German philosopher who was politically involved with National Socialism. The relations between Martin Heidegger and Nazism remain controversial. He was a member of the Nazi party, he joined the [[NSDAP]] on May 1, 1933 three weeks after being appointed rector of the [[University of Freiburg]]. Heidegger resigned the rectorship one year later, in April 1934, but remained a member of the NSDAP until the end of [[World War II]]. His first act as rector was to eliminate all democratic structures, including those that had elected him rector. There were book burnings on his campus, though he successfully stopped some of them. There was also student violence.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt/Martin Heidegger - E Ettinger - Yale University Press - 1995 - {{ISBN|0-300-07254-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=1UaRXIFHULcC&amp;pg=PR9]&lt;/ref&gt; Although after the war he neither apologized nor publicly expressed regret for his involvement with his [[Martin Heidegger and Nazism|affiliation with Nazism]],&lt;ref&gt;For critical readings of the interview (published in 1966 as "[[Only a God Can Save Us]]", ''[[Der Spiegel]]''), see the "Special Feature on Heidegger and Nazism" in ''Critical Inquiry'' 15:2 (Winter 1989), particularly the contributions by [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Maurice Blanchot|Blanchot]]. The issue includes partial translations of Derrida's ''Of Spirit'' and Lacoue-Labarthe's ''Of Spirit'' and ''Heidegger, Art, and Politics: the Fiction of the Political''.&lt;/ref&gt; in private he called it "the biggest stupidity of his life" (''die größte Dummheit seines Lebens'').&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Heinrich Wiegand Petzet, ''Auf einen Stern zugehen. Begegnungen und Gespräche mit Martin Heidegger 1929-1976'', 1983 p. 43, and also by Frédéric de Towarnicki, ''A la rencontre de Heidegger. Souvenirs d'un messager de la Forêt-Noire'', Gallimard-Arcades p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Carl Schmitt]] (11 July 1888 – 7 April 1985) was a jurist, philosopher, political theorist, and professor of law. Schmitt joined the [[Nazi Party]] on 1 May 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Koonz, ''The Nazi Conscience'', p 58 {{ISBN|0-674-01172-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented his theories as an ideological foundation of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] dictatorship, and a justification of the "[[Führer]]" state with regard to legal philosophy, in particular through the concept of ''[[auctoritas]]''. Nevertheless, in December 1936, the [[SS]] publication ''[[Das schwarze Korps]]'' accused Schmitt of being an opportunist, a Hegelian state thinker and basically a Catholic, and called his anti-semitism a mere pretense, citing earlier statements in which he criticized the Nazis' racial theories. After this, Schmitt resigned from his position as "Reichsfachgruppenleiter" (''Reich Professional Group Leader''), although he retained his post as a professor in Berlin, and his post as "''Preußischer Staatsrat''". Although Schmitt continued to be investigated into 1937, further reprisals were stopped by Göring.&lt;ref name="Bendersky"&gt;Bendersky, Joseph, W., Theorist For The Reich, 1983, Princeton, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noack"&gt;Noack, Paul, Carl Schmitt - Eine Biographie, 1996, Frankfurt&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Schmitt was captured by the American forces and released in 1946. Schmitt refused every attempt at de-nazification, which effectively barred him from positions in academia.

==Scientists and physicians==
* [[Hans Friedrich Karl Günther]] (1891–1968), German race researcher and [[eugenicist]] in the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany, also known as "Rassengünther" (Race Günther) or "Rassenpapst" (Race Pope). He is considered to be a major influence on National Socialist racialist thought, and was a member of the Nazi Party.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hale]].

He had a leading part in the Nazi, ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'', the plan to unite the previously independent Protestant churches into a single Church of the New Order, which is part of longer history of an attempt to unify the churches under the [[German Evangelical Church]], see ''[[Reichskirche]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Barnes, "Nazism, Liberalism and Christianity",  University Press of Kentucky, Kentucky 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Withholding baptism from non-Aryans was enforced in most churches during the Nazi period, though not without some protest.

* [[Gregor Strasser]] (1892–1934) Involved in the [[Kapp Putsch]] he formed his own völkischer Wehrverband ("popular defense union") which he merged into the NSDAP in 1921. Initially a loyal supporter of Adolf Hitler, he took part in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] and held a number of high positions in the Nazi Party. Soon however, Strasser became a strong advocate of the socialist wing of the party, arguing that the national revolution should also include strong action to tackle poverty and should seek to build working class support.
* [[Julius Streicher]] (1885–1946), the founder and publisher of [[Der Stürmer]] newspaper, which became a central element of the Nazi propaganda machine. His portrayal of Jews as subhuman and evil played a critical role in the dehumanization and marginalization of the Jewish minority in the eyes of common Germans – creating the necessary conditions for the later perpetration of the Holocaust. He was a member of the Nazi party.&lt;ref&gt;The Number One Nazi Jew-baiter: A Political Biography of Julius Streicher, Hitler's Chief Anti- …

==Intellectuals indirectly associated with Nazism==
Some writers came before the Nazi era and their writings were incorporated into Nazi ideology:
*[[Madame Blavatsky]] (1831–1891), founder of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and the [[Theosophical Society]]. [[Guido von List]] took up some of Blavatsky's racial theories, and mixed them with nationalism to create [[Ariosophy]], a precursor of [[Nazi ideology]].  Ariosophy  emphasized intellectual expositions of racial evolution. The [[Thule Society]] was one of several German occult groups drawing on Ariosophy to preach Aryan supremacy. It provides a direct link between occult racial theories and the racial ideology of Hitler and the emerging Nazi party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hitler's Racial Ideology: Content and Occult Sources.|journal=Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual|year=1986|author=[[Jackson J.

* [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] (1855–1927) was a British-born author of books on political philosophy, and natural science. His two-volume book ''Die Grundlagen des Neunzehnten Jahrhunderts'' (Foundations of the 19th. Century) (1899) became a manual for Nazi racial philosophy including the concept of the [[master race]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William L.

* [[Hans Freyer]] (1887–1969), German sociologist who called for an anti-liberal, anti-materialist, anti-Marxist ''Revolution von rechts'' (Revolution from the Right) that would emphasize organic bonds and community (''Gemeinschaft'') over the atomization of industrialized society (''Gesellschaft'').
* [[Arthur de Gobineau]] (1816–1882) was a French aristocrat, novelist and man of letters who developed the racialist theory of the Aryan [[master race]] in his book ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–1855). Although the book condemns [[antisemitism]] and describes Jews in positive terms, the Nazis still referenced the work since it condemns [[miscegenation|race mixing]] and describes the Jews as "alien".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Horrex Rowbotham, The literary works of Count de Gobineau, (1929), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; De Gobineau is credited as being the father of modern racial demography.&lt;ref&gt;Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines - A de Gobineau, H Juin - 1940 - uqac.ca.{{cite web|url=http://www.uqac.ca/zone30/Classiques_des_sciences_sociales/classiques/gobineau/essai_inegalite_races/essai_inegalite_races_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051030033940/http://www.uqac.ca/zone30/Classiques_des_sciences_sociales/classiques/gobineau/essai_inegalite_races/essai_inegalite_races_1.pdf |archivedate=October 30, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote extensively throughout World War I and the interwar period, and supported German hegemony in Europe.

The '''Loi du 20 décembre 1988 relative à la protection des personnes qui se prêtent à des recherches biomédicales''', also known as the '''Loi Huriet''' or '''Loi Huriet-Sérusclat''', is a [[French civil law]] to establish the regulation of those working in [[biomedical research]], and to formalise the [[status quo]] of [[bioethics]]. It was proposed under the second government of [[Michel Rocard]] ([[Parti socialiste (France)|Parti socialiste]]) six months after the [[French legislative election, 1988]]. It was the first French law that put [[clinical trial]]s on a firm legal footing.

== First statute ==
An appendix, IIb, to the French civil code on [[Public Health]], established the [[Comité consultatif de protection des personnes dans la recherche biomédicale]] (CCPPRB), later succeeded by the [[Comités de protection des personnes]] (CPP). Its ambit, defined in Article 15, established in law the notion of a {{lang|fr|consentement éclairé}} (a "Clear [[consent]]", perhaps similar to the [[Clean hands doctrine]] in [[common law]]), and established penalties for breaking the law.

The common name {{lang|fr|[[Loi Sérusclat-Huriet]]}}, and abbreviated variations such as {{lang|fr|[[Loi Huriet]]}} and {{lang|fr|[[Loi Sérusclat]]}}, come from the names of the nominator and seconder in the [[Senate (France)|French senate]], [[Claude Huriet]] ([[Union pour la démocratie française|Centrist]]) and [[Franck Sérusclat]] ([[Parti socialiste (France)|Socialist]]).

==Evolution==
As cases came to court with the usual [[jurisprudence]],&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;A French judge has far more investigative powers than those in [[Common law]] jurisdictions.&lt;/ref&gt; public perception of the importance of [[bioethics]] and other [[European Union law]], have supplemented the powers made under the original regulatory framework, such as {{lang-fr|[[Loi n°94-653 du 29 juillet 1994, relative au respect du corps humain]]}} ("Law of 29 July 1994, Respect of the human body"), which defined the legal notion of [[dignity]], and {{lang|fr|[[Loi du 4 mars 2002 relative aux droits des malades et à la qualité du système de santé]]}} ("Law of 4 March 2002, Patient rights and the quality of health system").

'''Luc Foisneau''', born in [[Blois]] on the 30th March 1963, is a French philosopher specialising in contemporary political thought and that of the [[Early Modern period]]. Director of research at [[CNRS]], he is a member of the [[Centre de recherches politiques Raymond Aron|Centre Raymond Aron]], and teaches at [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cespra.ehess.fr/index.php?1530&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
A former student of the [[Ecole normale supérieure]] (Fontenay-St Cloud) he has a PhD from Paris 1 - Panthéon-Sorbonne [http://www.univ-paris1.fr] and his habilitation (HDR) from [[Ecole des hautes études en sciences sociales]]. From 1993-1995 he was a member of the Centre de philosophie politique et juridique, in the [[University of Caen]], and from 1995-2003 a member of the Centre d'histoire de la philosophie moderne. In 2003 he joined the Department of Politics and International Relations at the [[University of Oxford]], pursuing research there and at the [[Maison Française]] until 2006. He was also lecturer at [[Sciences Po]], Paris, from 1993-2003.

== Research Themes ==

Foisneau wrote his doctoral thesis on the notion of the absolute power of God in Thomas Hobbes' political theory, notwithstanding Hobbes' reputation as a renowned atheist. Foisneau analysed this under-explored conception of power in relation to the fundamental moral and political principles underpinning Leviathan.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in John Dunn, « The Significance of Hobbes’s conception of power », Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy, Vol. 13, Nos. 2–3, June–September 2010, 417–433&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he was awarded the Prix de l'association des professeurs et maîtres de conférences de Sciences Po, Paris. He is recognised as a world expert on the work of Thomas Hobbes, which he has edited and translated into French.&lt;ref&gt;L. Foisneau, interview with Eduardo Wolf, "A democracia representativa tem um elemento aristocratico", Norte, 2009, p. 8-9 [Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt;
Foisneau also devoted fifteen years of research to one of the fundamental aspects of modern political thought: the connection between theories of sovereignty and theories of government.&lt;ref&gt;L. Foisneau, ‘Sovereignty and Reason of State: Bodin, Botero, Richelieu and Hobbes’, in H. A. Lloyd (ed.), The Reception of Bodin, Leiden/Boston, Brill, 2013, pp. 323-342&lt;/ref&gt; He has since turned his attention to the work of [[John Rawls]], and in particular the manner in which Early Modern contract theories were reprised and transformed in the Rawlsian tradition of theories of justice.&lt;ref&gt;See L. Foisneau and V. Munoz-Dardé, ‘La justice en question’, in John Rawls, Justice et critique, Paris, Ed. EHESS, 2014, p. 7-51&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he has focused on the ways in which the idea of justification has had a profound effect in transforming theories of modern democracy.&lt;ref&gt;See J.-Ch.

'''Mario Laserna Pinzón''' (August 21, 1923 – July 16, 2013) was a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] educator and politician born in Paris of Colombian parents. Laserna Pinzón is credited for being the founder of the [[Los Andes University (Colombia)|Los Andes University]] in [[Bogotá]], which was incorporated in 1948 and is a private institution modeled on the [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|United States liberal arts educational system]]. He also served as [[Senate of Colombia|Senator of Colombia]], and Ambassador to [[France]] and [[Austria]] and is an author of several books.

==Career==

===Education===
He was born in Paris, France on August 21, 1923 to Colombian parents, Francisco Laserna Bravo and Elena Pinzón Castillo, and was raised first in Colombia where he attended the Instituto La Salle and then from 1931 to 1932 in Queens in NYC.  He graduated from the [[Gimnasio Moderno]] in 1940 and went on to study Law for three years at [[Our Lady of the Rosary University]] to later change his career and move to the [[United States]] to attend [[Columbia University]] where he completed his [[Bachelor of Arts|undergraduate studies]] in Mathematics, Physics, and Humanities in 1948. He would go on to obtain a [[Master's degree]] at [[Princeton University]] and to study [[German language|German]] and philosophy at the [[University of Heidelberg]] in [[Germany]], and he later obtained a [[Doctorate]] at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. For his life's work he was awarded a Doctorate [[Honorary Degree|Honoris Causa]] by [[Brandeis University]].&lt;ref name="uniandes"&gt;{{cite web| title  = Fundador distinguido| url  = http://www.uniandes.edu.co/la_universidad/Fundadordistinguido.php| publisher  = [[Los Andes University (Colombia)|Los Andes University]]| language  = Spanish| accessdate  = 2005-05-19}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mario Laserna Pinzón is widely admired in his country as an educator, a politician, and a passionate seeker of knowledge, with numerous books and studies to his credit.  During the late 1940s and 1950s he became acquainted with many important scientific figures of the day, including [[Albert Einstein]], whom he met while studying at Princeton, and [[Nicolás Gómez Dávila]], his mentor.&lt;ref name="tiempo"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2007-11-27|title=Mario Laserna Le Gana Recuerdos Al Alzheimer|journal=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]|volume=Nación|location=Bogotá|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-2741041#|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ortiz"&gt;{{cite journal |first=María Paulina |last=Ortiz|date=1993-06-25 |title= El Soñador De Los Andes|journal=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |volume=Nación|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-847373|accessdate=2009-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, upon graduating from Columbia, he returned to Colombia and dedicated himself to the creation of a private secular institution of higher learning in [[Bogotá]]. His dream became a reality on November 16, 1948 when [[Los Andes University (Colombia)|Los Andes University]] was founded, institution of which he became [[Rector (academia)|rector]] between 1953 and 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rectores|publisher=[[Los Andes University (Colombia)|Los Andes University]]|url=http://www.uniandes.edu.co/la_universidad/Rectores.php|accessdate=2009-05-20}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as rector of the [[National University of Colombia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marina |last=Correa |title=Historia |url=http://www.ciencias.unal.edu.co/departamentos/departamentos.php?id=4&amp;ver=historia |publisher=[[National University of Colombia]] |language=Spanish |year=2005 |accessdate=2009-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611043642/http://www.ciencias.unal.edu.co/departamentos/departamentos.php?id=4&amp;ver=historia |archivedate=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1958–1960).

===Politics===
Given his high-profile Laserna was absorbed into politics by those who wanted to present the world with one of the best examples of Colombian intellect, and so he served as the Colombian [[Ambassador]] to his native [[France]] (1976–1979) and to [[Austria]] (1987–1990), served in the [[Senate of Colombia]]&lt;ref name="tiempo"/&gt; and served as [[councillor]] of Bogotá.&lt;ref name="ortiz"/&gt;

He worked in politics as a philosopher interested in learning the workings of government and people which led him to run as Senator representing the radical liberal party of the [[M-19 Democratic Alliance]], even though he himself belonged to the [[Colombian Conservative Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Palabras del Presidente del Partido Conservador Colombiano, Senador Efraín Cepeda Sarabia, en el acto de celebración de los 158 años del Partido Conservador. | first = Efraín | last = Cepeda Sarabia | date = 2007-10-02 | location = Bogotá, D.C. | url = http://partidoconservador.org/files/resourcesmodule/@random476163eb79407/1197565020_Cepeda_158_a_os_partido_conservador.doc | format = DOC | accessdate = 2009-05-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723153442/http://partidoconservador.org/files/resourcesmodule/@random476163eb79407/1197565020_Cepeda_158_a_os_partido_conservador.doc | archivedate = 2011-07-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; he said he joined the M-19 in spite of being a conservative because he ''"wanted to know how the people who had been [hiding] in the mountain and had returned to civil life thought. Also because they had Bolivarian roots"'',&lt;ref name="ortiz"/&gt; as he himself was a believer of [[Bolivarianism]].

As a Senator he had to answer to accusations of working with the fugitive Roberto Soto Prieto who had allegedly stolen $13.5 million [[US dollar]]s and with whom Laserna had connections in Austria through his work as Ambassador, at which time Soto Prieto was an alleged refugee in that country, and through alleged business deals in which Soto was found to be indirectly involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date =1993-09-30| title=Cargos Contra Laserna Por Nexos Con Soto |journal=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |volume=Justicia |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-232439 |accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of the Colombian Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Noemí Sanín]] the last five ambassadors to Austria and all employees of the embassy were investigated by the [[Inspector General of Colombia]] and the [[Attorney General of Colombia]], among those was Mario Laserna Pinzón.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1993-06-25 |title= Investigarán A 5 Ex Embajadores|journal=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |volume=Información general|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-147759 |accessdate=2009-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laserna was later cleared of all charges in respect to the case.

Because of his life's work and contribution to the country, President [[Álvaro Uribe Vélez]] honored him with the [[Order of Boyaca|Order of Boyacá in the Rank of the Grand Cross]], the highest civilian honour bestowed by the Republic of Colombia.&lt;ref name="uribe"&gt;{{cite speech | title = Palabras del Señor Presidente de la República Doctor Álvaro Uribe Vélez, con ocasión de la imposición de la condecoración de la Orden de Boyacá en el Grado de Gran Cruz, al Doctor Mario Laserna Pinzón | first = Álvaro | last = Uribe Vélez | authorlink = Álvaro Uribe Vélez | date = 2003-09-10 | location =Bogotá, D.C. | url = http://www.presidencia.gov.co/prensa_new/discursos/laserna.htm | accessdate = 2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works===
Mario Laserna was a very prolific reader and writer, which led him to write for various newspapers and to become the director of ''[[Revista Semana]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rodríguez Maldonado |first1=Tatiana |title=Imagen Y Discurso: Construcción de sentido en las portadas de las revistas Semana y Cambio 1998-2004|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/monografia/indice.htm|accessdate=2009-05-20|date=November 2005 |publisher= |location=Bogotá |language=Spanish |chapter=Reseñas de las revistas Semana y Cambio|chapterurl=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/monografia/mono2a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the newspaper ''[[La República (Colombia)|La República]]''.&lt;ref name="uribe"/&gt; He also authored various books and essays on Colombian history and government, development in the [[Third World]], and philosophy.

In [[Roman Catholicism]], the '''morning offering''' is a prayer said by an individual at the start of the day in order to consecrate oneself to [[Jesus Christ]]. The practice has traditionally been associated with the [[Apostleship of Prayer]]. While since 1929 the Pope has added a general and a mission intention to the traditional morning offering prayer each month,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popesprayerusa.net/papal-endorsements/|title=Papal Endorsements|website=Pope's Worldwide Prayer Network|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Francis]] has restored this to the original. single monthly intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popesprayerusa.net/2017-intentions/|title=2017 Intentions|website=Pope's Worldwide Prayer Network|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time other forms of the morning offering prayer have been suggested.

==History and theological basis==
The morning offering has been an old practice in the Church but it started to spread largely through the [[Apostleship of Prayer]], started by Fr. Francis X. Gautrelet, [[Jesuit|S.J.]], and especially through the book written by another [[Jesuit]], Fr. Henri Ramière, S.J., who in 1861 adapted the Apostleship of Prayer for parishes and various Catholic institutions, and made it known by his book "The Apostleship of Prayer" which has been translated into many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01633a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: The Apostleship of Prayer|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Johnvianney.jpg|360px|thumb|right|John Marie Vianney]]
Historic roots of such a practice can be traced to those like [[Saint Mechtilde]] (1241-1298) who had visions of Jesus Christ and transmitted the following words of Jesus: "When you awake in the morning, let your first act be to salute My Heart, and to offer Me your own. ...Whoever shall breathe a sigh toward Me from the bottom of his heart when he awakes in the morning and shall ask Me to work all his works in him throughout the day, will draw Me to him. ...For never does a man breathe a sigh of longing aspiration toward Me without drawing Me nearer to him than I was before."

[[John Vianney|Saint John Mary Vianney]] has also said: "All that we do without offering it to God is wasted." Catholic authors encourage repeating this offering throughout the day, especially at the start of one's professional work which takes a large part of each day.

The ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' states:
:The Christian begins his day, his prayers, and his activities with the Sign of the Cross: "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen." The baptized person dedicates the day to the glory of God and calls on the Savior's grace which lets him act in the Spirit as a child of the Father.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church §2157&lt;/ref&gt;

The other element in this theology is the actual work done with spirit of excellence in consonance with the intention of offering something "worthy" to the sanctity, majesty, and goodness of our God.

This theology is also supported by private revelation. Sister [[Josefa Menéndez]] (1890-1923) reported that she heard Jesus Christ tell her: "When you awake, enter at once into My Heart, and when you are in it, offer My Father all your actions united to the pulsations of My Heart. ...If [a person is] engaged in work of no value in itself, if she bathes it in My Blood or unites it to the work I Myself did during My mortal life, it will greatly profit souls, ... more, perhaps, than if she had preached to the whole world."

==Practice==
The Morning offering is meant to be prayed first thing in the morning, upon waking up. In its simplest form, a morning offering is nothing more than a brief prayer that recognizes the presence of God, and puts the day ahead in God's hands.&lt;ref name=und&gt;[http://campusministry.nd.edu/about-catholicism/year-of-faith/february---prayer-throughout-the-day/make-a-morning-offering/ "Make a Morning Offering", Campus Ministry, University of Notre Dame]&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of this offering are proposed on the website of the Apostleship of Prayer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popesprayerusa.net/daily-offering-prayers/|title=Daily Offering Prayers|website=Pope's Worldwide Prayer Network|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional ''Morning offering to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]]'' was composed by French Jesuit Fr. François-Xavier Gautrelet in 1844. It reflects the ''[[Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Harter, Michael. ''Hearts on fire: praying with Jesuits'', 2005 {{ISBN|0-8294-2120-3}} p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Socias, James. ''Handbook of Prayers'' 2006, {{ISBN|0-87973-579-1}} p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Acts of Reparation}}'''Traditional Morning Offering'''
:O Jesus, through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I offer you my prayers, works, joys, sufferings of this day, in union with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass throughout the world. {{nowrap|I offer}} them for all the intentions of your Sacred Heart; the salvation of souls, the reparation for sin, the reunion of all Christians; I offer them for the intentions of our bishops and of all members of the Apostleship of Prayer, and in particular for the intention recommended by the Holy Father this month.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Children's daily offering prayer'''
:For love of me you came to earth; you gave your life for me. So every day you give me now. I give back happily. Take all my laughter, all my tears, each thought, each word, each deed. And let them be my all-day prayer, to help all those in need.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''St. Mechtilde revelation, with two other mystics'''
:Dear Lord, I adore Thy Sacred Heart, which I desire to enter with acts of love, praise, adoration, and thanksgiving. I offer Thee my own heart as I sigh to Thee from its very depths, asking that Thou will worketh through me in all that I do this day; thus may I draw Thee closer to me than Thou wert before. I offer Thee all the crosses and sufferings of the world, in union with Thy life on earth, in expiation for sins. Please join my every action and heartbeat to the pulsations of Thy Heart. I unite all my works of this day to those labors Thou didst perform while Thou wert on earth, bathing them in Thy Precious Blood, and I offer them to the Heavenly Father so that many souls may be saved. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholictradition.org/Christ/morning-offering2.htm|title=MORNING OFFERING|last=Fongemie|first=Pauly|website=www.catholictradition.org|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A daily offering for pro-life activists'''
:God, you know the desires of our hearts for authentic peace, justice, and love. I offer you my prayers, thoughts, words, actions, joys, and sufferings today, together with Jesus who continues to offer himself to us in the Eucharist; who continues to reveal himself to us in the poor, the oppressed, the marginalized, the unborn, the most vulnerable in our world. May your Holy Spirit be my guide and strength today so that I may be a witness to your love, your justice, and your peace, and to the sanctity of each human life. Together with Mary, our mother, sister, and friend, she who carried the Savior in her womb, with all the communion of saints, and with all of us who offer ourselves to you for the good of others today, we pray: Amen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12647">'''Neat''' and '''scruffy''' are labels for two different types of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) research. '''Neats''' consider that solutions should be [[elegance (mathematics)|elegant]], clear and [[Correctness (computer science)|provably correct]]. '''Scruffies''' believe that intelligence is too complicated (or [[computationally intractable]]) to be solved with the sorts of homogeneous system such neat requirements usually mandate.

Much success in AI came from combining neat and scruffy approaches. For example, there are many [[cognitive model]]s matching human [[psychological]] data built in [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ACT-R]]. Both of these systems have formal representations and execution systems, but the rules put ''into'' the systems to create the models are generated [[ad hoc]].

==History==
The distinction was originally made by [[Roger Schank]] in the mid-1970s to characterize the difference between his work on [[natural language processing]] (which represented [[commonsense knowledge]] in the form of large amorphous [[semantic net]]works) from the work of [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], [[Allen Newell]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], [[Robert Kowalski]] and others whose work was based on logic and formal extensions of logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roger Schank actually notes that he originally made this distinction in linguistics, related to Chomskian vs. non-Chomskian, but discovered it works in AI too, and other areas.

The distinction was also partly geographical and cultural: "scruffy" was associated with AI research at [[MIT]] under [[Marvin Minsky]] in the 1960s. The laboratory was famously "freewheeling" and researchers often developed AI programs by spending long hours tweaking programs until they showed the required behavior. This practice was named "[[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacking]]" and the laboratory gave birth to the hacker culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=68−71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important and influential "scruffy" programs developed at MIT included [[Joseph Weizenbaum]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Weizenbaum would become a critic of AI, and would specifically single out the practice of "hacking" as "pathological". {{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|pp=374–376}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ELIZA]], which behaved as if it spoke English, without any formal knowledge at all, and [[Terry Winograd]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Winograd also became a critic of early approaches to AI as well, arguing that intelligent machines could not be built using formal symbols exclusively, but required [[embodied cognition]]. {{Harv|Winograd|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SHRDLU]], which could successfully answer queries and carry out actions in a simplified world consisting of blocks and a robot arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|pp=300–305}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=84−102}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SHRDLU]], while enormously successful, could not be scaled up into a useful [[natural language processing]] system, however, because it had no overarching design and maintaining a larger version of the program proved to be impossible; it was too scruffy to be extended.

Other AI laboratories (of which the largest were [[Stanford]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]]) focused on logic and formal problem solving as a basis for AI. These institutions supported the work of [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], [[Allen Newell]], [[Donald Michie]], [[Robert Kowalski]], and many other "neats".

The contrast between MIT's approach and other laboratories was also described as a "procedural/declarative distinction". Programs like SHRDLU were designed as agents that carried out actions; they executed "procedures". Other programs were designed as inference engines that manipulated formal statements (or "declarations") about the world and translated these manipulations into actions.

The debate reached its peak in the middle 1980s. [[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] in his presidential address to [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]]  in 1983, discussed the issue, arguing that "the field needed both". He wrote "much of the knowledge we want our programs to have can and should be represented declaratively in some kind of declarative, logic like formalism. Ad hoc structures have their place, but most of these come from the domain itself."&lt;ref&gt;Nils Nilsson, presidential address to [[AAAI]] in 1983 quoted in {{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|pp=421–422.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex P. Pentland and Martin Fischler of [[MIT]] argued in response that "There is no question that deduction and logic-like formalisms will play an important role in AI research; however, it does not seem that they are up to the Royal role that Nils suggests. This pretender King, while not naked, appears to have a limited wardrobe."&lt;ref&gt;Pentland and Fischler 1983, quoted in {{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|pp=423–424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other researchers also weighed in on one side or the other of the issue.

The scruffy approach was applied to robotics by [[Rodney Brooks]] in the middle 1980s. He advocated building robots that were, as he put it, [[Fast, Cheap and Out of Control]] (the title of a 1989 paper co-authored with Anita Flynn). Unlike earlier robots such as [[Shakey the robot|Shakey]] or the Stanford cart, they did not build up representations of the world by analyzing visual information with algorithms drawn from mathematical [[machine learning]] techniques, and they did not plan their actions using formalizations based on logic, such as the '[[Planner programming language|Planner]]' language. They simply reacted to their sensors in a way that tended to help them survive and move.&lt;ref name=M454&gt;{{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|pp=454–459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doug Lenat]]'s [[Cyc]] project, one of the oldest and most ambitious projects to capture all of human knowledge in machine readable form, is "a determinedly scruffy enterprise" (according to [[Pamela McCorduck]]).&lt;ref name=M489&gt;{{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|p=489}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cyc database contains millions of facts about all the complexities of the world, each of which must be entered one at a time, by knowledge engineers. Each of these entries is an ad hoc addition to the intelligence of the system. While there may be a "neat" solution to the problem of [[commonsense knowledge]] (such as [[machine learning]] algorithms with [[natural language processing]] that could study the text available over the internet), no such project has yet been successful.

New [[Artificial intelligence#Statistical|statistical]] and mathematical approaches to AI were developed in the 1990s, using highly developed formalisms such as [[Bayesian net]]s and [[optimization (mathematics)|mathematical optimization]]. This general trend towards more formal methods in AI is described as  "the victory of the neats" by [[Peter Norvig]] and [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]].&lt;ref name=RN25&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=25−26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pamela McCorduck]], in 2004: "As I write, AI enjoys a Neat hegemony, people who believe that machine intelligence, at least, is best expressed in logical, even mathematical terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|p=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neat solutions have been highly successful in the 21st century and are now used throughout the technology industry. These solutions, however, have mostly been applied to specific problems with specific solutions, and the problem of [[Artificial general intelligence|general intelligence]] remains unsolved.

The terms "neat" and "scruffy" are rarely used by AI researchers in the 21st century, although the issue remains unresolved. "Neat" solutions to problems such as [[machine learning]] and [[computer vision]], have become indispensable throughout the technology industry,&lt;ref name=RN25/&gt; but ad-hoc and detailed solutions still dominate research into [[robotics]] and [[commonsense knowledge]].

==Typical methodologies==

As might be guessed from the terms, ''neats'' use [[formal methods]] &amp;ndash; such as [[logic]] or pure applied [[statistics]] &amp;ndash; exclusively.  ''Scruffies'' are [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hackers]], who will cobble together a system built of anything &amp;ndash; even [[logic]]. Neats care whether their reasoning is both [[proof theory|provably]] [[Soundness|sound]] and [[Gödel's completeness theorem|complete]] and that their [[machine learning]] systems can be shown to converge in a known length of time. Scruffies would like their learning to converge too, but they are happier if [[empirical]] experience shows their systems working than to have mere [[equations]] and [[Mathematical proof|proof]]s showing that they ''ought'' to.

To a neat, scruffy methods appear promiscuous, successful only by accident and unlikely to produce insights about how intelligence actually works. To a scruffy, neat methods appear to be hung up on [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalism]] and to be too slow, fragile or boring to be applied to real systems.

==Relation to philosophy and human intelligence==

This conflict goes much deeper than [[computer programming]] practices, (though it clearly has parallels in [[software engineering]]). For [[philosophical]] or possibly [[scientific]] [[reason (logic)|reasons]], some people believe that [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] is fundamentally [[Rationality|rational]], and can best be represented by [[logical system]]s incorporating [[truth maintenance systems|truth maintenance]]. Others believe that intelligence is best implemented as a mass of [[learned]] or [[evolved]] [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hack]]s, not necessarily having [[internal consistency]] or any unifying organizational framework.

The apparently scruffy philosophy may also turn out to be provably (under typical assumptions) [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal]] for many applications.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Intelligence is often seen as a form of [[search algorithm|search]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Winston|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such not believed to be perfectly solvable in a reasonable amount of time (see also [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and Simple [[Heuristics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gigerenzer|Todd|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[commonsense reasoning]], [[memetics]], [[reactive planning]]).

It is an open question whether ''human'' intelligence is inherently scruffy or neat. Some claim that the question itself is unimportant: the famous neat [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] has said publicly he has no interest in how human intelligence works{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}, while famous scruffy [[Rodney Brooks]] is openly obsessed with creating humanoid intelligence. (See [[Subsumption architecture]], [[Cog (project)|Cog project]] (Brooks 2001)).

He started out as a marxist philosopher, writing about [[psychoanalysis]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]]. Beginning in the mid-1980s, however, his focus has gradually shifted towards the [[sociological systems theory]] of [[Niklas Luhmann]], and much less political themes.

In the mid-1990s he was appointed [[Professor]] at the [[Copenhagen Business School]], where he was also one of the initiators of the combination MA degree in Business Administration and Philosophy in 1995.

Recent works by Thyssen have focused on [[management philosophy]] and [[values-based management]] (not to be confused with [[value-based management]]), as well as on a number of sociological themes. Most are based on Luhmann's systems theory.

'''Otto Heinrich von Gemmingen zu Hornberg''' (5 November 1755 - 3 March 1836) was a member of the aristocratic [[:de:Gemmingen (Adelsgeschlecht)|Gemmingen]] family.   He was an [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] era writer and a member of a circle of [[Illuminati]].   He was a [[diplomat]] and a [[free mason]].   He was also a friend of the composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap&gt;{{cite web|title=Otto Heinrich von Gemmingen|url=http://www.epoche-napoleon.net/bio/g/gemmingen.html|work=Epoche Napoleon ... von der Bastille bis Waterloo|publisher=Michael Gnessner, Duisburg|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OHGlautADB&gt;{{cite web|title=Gemmingen-Hornberg, Otto Heinrich Freiherr von|url= https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Gemmingen-Hornberg,_Otto_Heinrich_Freiherr_von|author= Erich Schmidt |work=[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]|publisher= Historische Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften| volume=8| date=1878| pages=557–558| accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OHGlautNDB&gt;{{cite web|title= Gemmingen-Hornberg, Otto Heinrich Freiherr von|url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd118716778.html#ndbcontent|author=Gustav Gugitz|work=[[Neue Deutsche Biographie]]|volume=6|date=1964|page=179|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
=== Family provenance and early years ===
Otto Heinrich von Gemmingen-Hornberg was born at the [[Free imperial city]] [[Heilbronn]] where his parents were based for a period.   His father, also called Otto Heinrich von Gemmingen (1727–90) worked as a judge at the [[Reichskammergericht|imperial district court]] in [[Wetzlar]], and it was here that he spent the first ten years of his life, receiving his schooling from his father, probably with backup from a tutor.&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;

His mother, Marie Elis von Gemmingen-Hornberg (1723-1775), was the widow of [[Ambrosius Franz, Count of Virmont|Count von Virmont]] and a daughter of Johann Hermann Franz von Nesselrode.&lt;ref name=OHGlautNDB/&gt;

After the death of his grandfather his father gave up his work as a judge in 1766 and the family relocated to [[Heilbronn]].   From the lawyerly social milieu in the bustling commercial centre, he would move to a more traditionally aristocratic lifestyle during his earl teenage years, with parties and concerts and fireworks in summer evenings and tobogganing in the winter.   It was in this context that the younger Otto Heinrich - generally known as Heinrich in the family - had his first experience of "theatre" at the "Komödiensaal" in the town hall, making frequent stage appearances in the works of Lessing, Schiller, Shakespeare and other playwrights fashionable at the time.&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;   His father nevertheless continued to place emphasis on more serious aspects of his education.   Important for any future career in politics or diplomacy was mastery of the French language, and both French and Jurisprudence featured prominently in his studies.   Literature and Music were not ignored, however.   Heinrich had access not merely to his father's extensive library but also to the public library in the town, which afforded excellent opportunities for building his knowledge.   He also became a competent performer on the [['cello]] and on the [[piano]].   He was a frequent visitor at the home of [[:de:Gottlob Moriz Christian von Wacks|Gottlob Moriz Christian von Wacks]], the longstanding mayor of [[Heilbronn]], by whose wife, Charlotte Sophie von Wacks, a great lover of the arts, Heinrich's own taste was greatly influenced.   During these teenage years he also had a brief but intense love affair with Lotte, the daughter of a Heilbronn businessman.   His artistic mentor, Charlotte Sophie von Wacks, attempted to end the affair which she believed might obstruct Heinrich's subsequent education.   She warned Lotte's mother what was happening.   When that failed to have any effect she arranged a meeting between the two fathers.   In the end Lotte was persuaded that Heinrich's commitment was not as absolute as she had thought, while Heinrich's father brought forward the date on which the boy should be sent away to pursue his studies.&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;    Heinrich von Gemmingen later recycled the experience in his play, "Der deutsche Hausvater", with which he established his reputation as a dramatist virtually overnight.

=== Mannheim years ===
When he was still only 19 he was sent to [[Mannheim]] to pursue his legal studies, although he still made frequent returns to [[Heilbronn]] where he continued to participate in the drama productions at the town hall.   As far as theatre was concerned, the atmosphere in Mannheim was at this stage strikingly less carefree than in provincial [[Heilbronn]], and tainted by an undercurrent of piety:  the absolutist rulers had let it be known that scholars and aristocrats should attend theatre, if at all, discreetly, observing performances only from the back of the auditorium.&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;    Von Gemmingen's love for the theatre persisted, however, and Mannheim was changing.   Its position on one of Europe's main communication channels, the [[River Rhine]], gave the city quick access to new currents of [[Age of Enlightenment|"Enlightenment"]] thinking.   He settled quickly into Mannheim society and soon came to the attention of the authorities.   After barely half a year in the city he was appointed a [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]], although he never showed any appetite for the life of a courtier.   In any case, jobs of this nature disappeared when the royal court left Mannheim for Munich in 1778 after [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Theodore]], the Prince-Elector, inherited the [[Electorate of Bavaria|dukedom of Bavaria]].   Meanwhile,  von Gemmingen continued to read extensively and to profit from the cultural opportunities provided by [[Mannheim]] and nearby [[Schwetzingen]].   He attended and was deeply affected by a performance of what was said to be the first [[opera]] sung in the [[German language]].&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;    Around this time he took the decision to devote his free time in future to learning how to become a writer.   He wanted to be able to use these skills to enlighten and, in the words of one source, to liberate the simple people from ignorance.&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;

Meanwhile, in or before 1777 he became a "Hofkammerrath" in Mannheim, which cemented his membership of society and gave him oversight responsibilities for education and schools which also extended to the [[National Theatre Mannheim|"deutsche Bühne" (principal Mannheim theatre)]],&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt; (a set of duties from which [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] had just resigned).

=== Mozart friendship ===
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] arrived in Mannheim at the start of his second visit to the city on 30 October 1777.   Gemmingen-Hornberg and the composer quickly got to know one another and to value each other's company.   They shared a love of music and a passion for the theatre.   Together they worked on "Semiramis", an opera which is believed subsequently to have been lost&lt;ref name=OHGlautADB/&gt; (and may very well never have been completed).&lt;ref name="Schroeder1999"/&gt;  Mozart mentions Gemmingen a number of times in letters to his father.   He writes about their work together on the first act of "Semiramis" in which the work is described as an "opera" and then as a "duodrama".&lt;ref name="Schroeder1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=David P. Schroeder|title=A nonexistent opera: Semiramis|work=Mozart in Revolt: Strategies of Resistance, Mischief, and Deception| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-i26q0ueM48C&amp;pg=PA143|year=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn= 978-0-300-07542-7|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;   During the next few months Mozart and Gemmingen were frequently seen out and about together, for instance in rehearsals for the [[Ignaz Holzbauer|Holzbauer]] opera [[Günther von Schwarzburg (opera)|"Günter von Schwarzburg"]].   They were seen together on 6 November 1777 when Mozart was presented to [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|the prince-elector]], and again on 3 December when Mozart was giving lessons to the ("extra-marital") four children of the prince-elector born in rapid succession to [[Josepha von Heydeck|Josepha Seyffert]] (who later became the Countess von Heydeck).   Although himself a member of the influential "Kurpfälzischen Deutschen Gesellschaft" (''"Kurpfalz German Society"'') only since 1776, Gemmingen was well known to fellow members, having already given many presentations and lectures to it, and he was able to introduce Mozart to the membership.   That led to a number of intense discussions over how the German language might be promoted, at a time when much literature was in French and operas normally featured Italian lyrics.   There was also discussion over how a German national theatre might be established.&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;

On 15 March 1778 Mozart set out on a journey to [[Paris]], accompanied by his mother.   He had already been obliged to sell his own carriage to finance the trip, and Gemmingen was able to improve the quality of his journey, providing three gold "[[Louis d'or]]" coins, "to repay the expense of writing out the music" of a recently composed quartet.&lt;ref name=WAM24Mar1778&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pianosociety.com/pages/mozartlettersparis/|title=Paris Match 1778-January 1779: Letter nbr. 100|work=The letters of Mozart  ...

=== National theatre ===
Meanwhile, the national theatre project became a reality and on 1 September 1778 [[Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg]] was appointed  intendant (in effect, director) of the [[National Theatre Mannheim|National Theatre]] in [[Mannheim]].   A permanent theatre company was created, headed up by [[August Wilhelm Iffland]].   The first production was presented on 7 October 1779 and within a few years Mannheim became one of the leading theatres in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]].   The premier of [[The Robbers]] on 13 January 1782 was a huge success with the public, marking as it did the public launch of the career of a new playwright, [[Friedrich Schiller]].   The success also made the [[National Theatre Mannheim|National Theatre]] itself a cultural focus for intellectual elites.   In recognition of his contribution to launching and sustaining the theatre project Heinrich von Gemmingen zu Hornberg was invited to assume oversight of [[dramaturgy]].   He also became a frequent and committed theatre critic.   In 1779 it became apparent that he had also been working on a play of his own.&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;

Meanwhile, early in July 1778, news came through that [[Anna Maria Mozart|Mozart's mother]] had died suddenly while accompanying her son in Paris.   Mozart returned to Mannheim where Gemmingen showed him the translation he was working on of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s [[Pygmalion (Rousseau)|Pygmalion]], and discussed his plans for translating [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]].   However, Mozart received a forceful letter from his father, dated 9 December 1778, ordering him urgently back to [[Vienna]].   There was no question of disobeying his father, but Mozart gave free rein to his anger.

=== Success with "Hausvater" ===
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#FFDEAD|align=right|width=45%|
{{left|''' [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] wrote to the intendant at [[National Theatre Mannheim|National Theatre]] in [[Mannheim]]'''}}&lt;br&gt;
"Ich höre, dass ein Baron von Gemmingen der Verfasser des Hausvaters ist und wünschte«, die Ehre zu haben, diesem Mann zu versichern, dass ich eben diesen Hausvater für ungemein gut erfunden halte und einen vortrefflichen Mann und sehr schönen Geist bewundert habe."&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;&lt;br&gt;''"I hear that a certain Baron von Gemmingen is the author of "Hausvater", and I wanted to have the honour to assure this man that I think "Hausvater" is tremendously good, and a perfectly crafted characterisation with a superb spirit."''
}}
In 1779 Gemmingen revisited the thwarted love affair of his youth with his performance piece "Der deutsche Hausvater" (''loosely: "The German house father"'').   The play was presented in the Autumn/Fall before the  "Kurpfälzischen Deutschen Gesellschaft" (''"Kurpfalz German Society"'').   It was consciously and unusually political, denouncing the division between aristocracy and bourgeoisie, and the treatment of the peasantry by both.   Gemmingen used the piece as a passionate attack on class barriers.   The audience included both friends and critics - those who had criticised him in the past for excessive restraint and vagueness.   At the end of the first reading, resounding applause broke out.   Apprehension on the part of some of the aristocratic audience members could not prevent the piece becoming a success.   The actor manager [[Friedrich Ludwig Schröder]] (who later became a personal friend), immediately accept the play for his company, and headed up the first performance at [[Hamburg]] on 4 October 1779.   Within a few months "Der deutsche Hausvater" was enjoying long runs in [[Munich]], [[Hamburg]], [[Berlin]], [[Vienna]], [[Prague]] and a number of smaller cities.   It was even translated into Italian.   [[Friedrich Schiller]], whose own later play [[Intrigue and Love]] was clearly influenced by "Hausvater", wrote effusively to [[Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg]] at the [[National Theatre Mannheim|National Theatre]], with warm words to be passed to the author of the work.&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;

=== Free masonry ===
It is believed that Gemmingen joined the [[freemason]]s around 1779 when he was 24.   He had connections with several lodges, not just in [[Mannheim]] itself but also in [[Heidelberg]], [[Worms]] and [[Vienna]].   There are also indications that he introduced the young Mozart to freemasonry during the composer's time in [[Mannheim]], although there is no firm evidence for this.&lt;ref name=fmlautNaxos&gt;{{cite web|title=Mozart und die Freimaurerei|url=https://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.570897&amp;catNum=570897&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=German|publisher=Naxos Records| work=Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791), Maurerische Musik|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is probable that Gemmingen became a member of the [[:de:Carl zur Eintracht|Carl zur Eintracht lodge]] in Mannheim in 1779, some 23 years after the establishment of the lodge, which came under the direction of the [[Grand Lodge]] [[:de:Große Loge von Preußen genannt Royal York zur Freundschaft|of Prussia called Royal York for friendship]].   He appears already to have reached the degree of [[Master craftsman|"Master"]] by 1782 when he relocated to [[Vienna]] where, between 1782 and 1787, he was regarded as one of the city's leading free masons.&lt;ref name=FMlautHR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2005/50/A_Jakobiner_i__Wien/komplettansicht |title=Die Jakobiner von Wien|work=Über Mozart als Freimaurer ist viel geschrieben worden. Doch wenige nur wissen, dass etliche seiner Bundesbrüder in den Tagen der Französischen Revolution zu aktiven Demokraten wurden|author= Helmut Reinalter|date=8 December 2005| publisher= [[Die Zeit]] (online)| accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
His court appointment involved working in the [[Schwetzingen Palace]], and Gemmingen therefore took rooms in the palace "for reasons of economy" (as he wrote to his father).   This meant regularly dining at the [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Prince-elector's]] table, and in the palace grounds he frequently met the [[Countess Palatine Elisabeth Auguste of Sulzbach|Countess Palatine]] accompanied by her ladies in waiting.   One of these was the Countess Charlotte [[House of Sickingen|von Sicklingen]] (1756-1826)&lt;!---Maria Karoline Charlotte von Sickingen---&gt;.   Gemmingen and Charlotte married on 8 September 1779.   Shortly afterwards the couple were temporarily separated when the [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Prince-elector]] acquired Bavaria and moved the court to Munich.   Gemmingen moved with the court.   The Prince-elector's wife, the  [[Countess Palatine Elisabeth Auguste of Sulzbach|Countess Palatine]] remained in Mannheim, however, together with her ladies in waiting.

In Munich Gemmingen oversaw the first Munich productions of "The Inheritance" and "The House-father", which had to be adapted for Bavarian conditions.   However, in 1780 he was able to return to Mannheim for the birth of [[:de:Karl Theodor Joseph von Gemmingen|his first son]].

=== Move to Vienna:  enlightenment years ===
In 1781 oversight of schools, which had fellan within the  Gemmingen's remit, was transferred to the Catholic Church.   That would have been a setback to any ambitions Gemmingen may have had to implement the new [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment values]] in the electorate.   A little earlier, in November 1780, the death of the [[Maria Theresa|Empress Maria Theresa]] had left her eldest son, as [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]], free to pursue Enlightenment ideals in the Hapsburg lands, unencumbered by his mother's pragmatic conservatism.  Heinrich von Gemmingen's position at court was worth 950 [[Baden gulden|Gulden]] per month plus bonuses.   He now resigned his position and moved to [[Vienna]] where he hoped to be able to progress his goals under more favourable conditions.   In Vienna he received a friendly welcome:  it is possible that his friend Mozart had prepared the ground for his arrival.  He quickly gained access to the household of the [[:de:Maria Anna von Kottulinsky|Princess of Thun]], who was exceptionally well connected in literary and musical circles.   In her house he would have met members of the nobility, writers and musicians.   [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|The emperor himself]], arriving incognito, was also a frequent visitor.&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;

[[Friedrich Münter]] wrote that Gemmingen "was very influential in the background through his connections with [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg|Kaunitz]], [[Gottfried van Swieten|Swieten]] and  [[:de:Maria Anna von Kottulinsky|the Princess of Thun]].   Backed by other influential freemasons, Gemmingen tried to support [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II's]] policy of reform, using his contributions to the weekly political journals "Weltmann" and "Wahrheiten" for which, in 1783, he became editor.   As editor, he continued to write many of the articles himself, using the pseudonym "O. H. Edler von Hoffenheim", a reference to the estate at [[Hoffenheim]] which his father had inherited in 1781.  There were contributions from other freemasons, and some of the ideas of the "[[Illuminati]]" (of whom he evidently became one) also found a resonance in the journals.   However, his publications attracted some hostility in aristocratic and, more particularly, church circles.&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;   The established church in [[Vienna]] was still the [[Roman Catholic]] Church.   One article Gemmingen published appeared under the headline, "Dabei schaffe sich der Mensch zwischen sich und Gott Mittelwesen, wobei er über diese Gott vergisst" (''"Thus mankind creates intermediaries [i.e. saint] enabling him to forget about God"'').   Another was headed "Schutzpatrone, Heilige überhaupt und besonders Maria: Was sind dies anderes als Mittelwesen? … Noch ein allgemeiner Zug des Aberglaubens ist die übertriebene Verehrung des Priestertum." (''"Protectors, saints in general and the Blessed Mary in particular:  These are nothing more than intermediaries - one more piece of pressure to honour the priests excessively"'').

=== Feemasonry in Vienna and its divisions ===
Gemmingen's time in Viemnna coincided with a struggle in the city's energetic masonic community.   This had been unleashed by new types of teaching associated with the reformist [[Rite of Strict Observance|"Strict Observance"]] movement, which Gemmingen opposed because of the enhanced role it gave to [[Sacred mysteries|"occult mysticism"]].   This led him to support the creation of a new lodge, respecting the older obligations and the differenatiation between the difference degrees (ranks) of members, along with backing for Enlightenment goals, charity, toloeration, rejection of superstition, and support for the emperor's (pro-enlightenment) reforms by word and deed.   That led to the establishment a new lodge based on the so-called [[:de:Zur wahren Eintracht|precepts of true concord]].&lt;ref name=OHGHlautZeno&gt;{{cite web|title=Gemmingen-Hornberg, Otto Heinrich von  ...  Biographie|publisher=Contumax GmbH &amp; Co. KG (Zeon.org)|url=http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Gemmingen-Hornberg,+Otto+Heinrich+von/Biographie| accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The development was made known in a letter dated 14 February 1783, and Gemmingen himself became Master of the Lodge which received strong backing from the original (itself founded in Vienna in 1781) [[:de:Zur wahren Eintracht|Lodge of true concord]].

Soon afterwards he became the district lodge secretary for Vienna, with the mandate to draft up some constitutional statutes.   It was under these statutes that on 22 April 1784 The Austrian Grand Lodge  was set up under the leadership of [[Karl Johann Baptist, Prince of Dietrichstein|Prince Dietrichstein]].   This was seen as a great achievement on Gemmingen's part.   By the end of 1784 the "lodge of good deeds" (''"Loge Zur Wohltätigkeit"'') comprised around 40 members.   A highlight was the recruitment of Gemmingen's friend, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], after the composer became aware that Gemmingen was a member of the at that time secret organisation.

=== Setbacks ===
After he had been appointed editor in chief of "Wöchentlichen Wahrheiten für und über die Prediger in Wien" (''"Weekly Truths for and about Priests in Vienna"'') in 1783 and, at about the same time, taken charge of "Der Weltmann", which was if anything less restrained in discussion of church matters, Gemmingen found himself on the receiving end of attacks from [[Leopold Alois Hoffmann]], founder of "Wöchentlichen Wahrheiten" and Gemmingen's predecessor as its editor in chief.   Gemmingen's editorial appointments had been made in response to "orders from on high", which seems to refer to behind the scenes string pulling on the part of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|the emperor himself]].  But now it was Hoffmann who complained that fees due to him had not been paid and promises had not been kept.   In fact, Gemmingen had taken care to ensure that Hoffmann received a dispensation meaning that, despite his relative youth, he could become a member of the "lodge of good deeds" (''"Loge Zur Wohltätigkeit"'').   He also employed Hoffmann as his secretary, and used his influence with his friend [[Gottfried van Swieten|Swieten]] to see to it that Hoffmann received a post as a professor at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Pest]].   In later years [[Leopold Alois Hoffmann|Hoffmann]] acquired a reputation as a leading critic in the media of [[freemasonry]].&lt;ref name=LAHlautBLKOe&gt;{{cite web|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK%C3%96:Hoffmann,_Leopold_Alois|title=Hoffmann, Leopold Alois (Schriftsteller, geb. zu Wien, nach Anderen in Böhmen 1748, gest. zu Wiener Neustadt 2. September 1806)|work=Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich|author=Constantin von Wurzbach (compiler)|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is possible that even in 1784 his hostility to Gemmigen was conflated with a negative view of the movement.   It is also possible that after publication of "Wöchentlichen Wahrheiten" ended on 10 June 1784, Gemmingen could no longer justify (or afford) retaining Hoffmann as his secretary, and Hoffmann's subsequent attacks were a form a "pay back".

Since 1783 or earlier Gemmingen had been thinking that the weekly political journals for which he was responsible, targeted on members of the upper classes, were too restricted in their appeal, and in 1784 he launched "Magazin für Wissenschaften und Literature" (''"Magazine for Sciences and Literature"''), intended to appeal to the growing ranks of [[Vienna]]'s bourgeoisie.   However, by 1785 this project was abandoned, having failed to interest its intended readership.   One source speculates that it was pitched "at too high a level".&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;   In 1784 financial pressures drove Gemmingen to try and obtain a position at court, but in this he was not successful.   Shortly afterwards, on 22 August 1784, he was placed under police surveillance, and his written work was subjected to censorship for the first time.   He made one more attempt to launch a political journal with a more popular appeal, this time under the title "Vienna [[Ephemeris]]".   This fared better than his earlier attempt, and was published till 1787, the year in which he left [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;

Gemmingen's departure from Vienna was sudden and largely unexplained.   There are suggestions that he had made too many enemies in the city.  He certainly faced financial challenges.   These arose in connection with the indebtedness of his brother-in-law, Franz von Sickingen.   Gemmingen's wife was certainly always very close to her brother whose approach to his finances seems to have been excessively "easy going".&lt;!---per German wiki, tho another source would be nice---&gt;

=== Inheritance ===
Gemmingen's father died on 3 February 1790 and he moved with his family into the patrimonial estate at [[Hoffenheim]], between [[Heidelberg]] and [[Heilbronn]].   Six weeks later, on 26 March 1790, he issued an "Ordinance" which reads like a cross between the constitution for a small state and a set of instructions to his tenants.   The details in this prescriptive document document are characterised by practical attention to detail worthy of a German product of [[Age of Enlightenment|the enlightnement]].&lt;ref name=OHGlautEpoNap/&gt;   Sources are silent over the implementation phase of the Hoffenheim Ordinance, but by the end of 1790 Gemmingen had sold the Hoffenheim estate to his younger brother, Sigmund, for 40,000 [[Baden gulden|Gulden]].   On 11 May 1791 he purchased an estate at nearby [[:de:Maudach|Maudach]], on the farther bank of the [[Rhine]], for 36,000 Gulden.   In an age before railroads and motorways the river was the principal transport artery for the region, and his new estate was less than an hour away from [[Mannheim]], [[Heidelberg]], [[Schwetzingen]] and [[Speyer]].   Gemmingen moved in with his family, spending a lot of time in Mannheim on the opposite bank.   However, in 1795 the [[French revolution]] came to his Maudach estate, the [[French Revolutionary Army|"revolutionary army"]] badly damaging the estate and destroying part of his book collection.   With his brother-in-law Franz von Sickingen he now exchanged the Maudach property for an estate at Mühlbach near [[Karlstadt am Main]] which was in a slightly less exposed position with regard to marauding armies, and which he had inherited via his wife.&lt;ref name=OHGlautHN&gt;{{cite web|title=Otto Heinrich von Gemmingen (1755-1836)|publisher=Stadtarchiv Heilbronn |url=https://stadtarchiv.heilbronn.de/stadtgeschichte/geschichte-a-z/g/gemmingen-otto-heinrich-von.html|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Back to Vienna ===
In 1799 Gemmingen was sent on a special mission to [[Vienna]] on behalf of [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|the court]].   In Vienna his initial reception was cool.   Enlightenment principals had lost their appeal in the light of the [[French Revolution]] and [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|the Emperor Joseph]] had died in 1790, but there were many in the political establishment who still remembered Gemmingen from his time in Vienna during the 1780s.   However, his diplomatic skills soon won him recognition at the [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|court]].   The [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|Margrave of Baden]] was more than pleased with his performance and appointed him a permanent plenipotentiary to the Court at Vienna, for which he received annual remuneration of 22,000 Gulden.

With Napoleon's decisive victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], [[Electorate of Baden|Baden]] benefitted substantially from the [[Napoleon|French empoeror]]'s favour, its territory substantially enlarged as it became the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], a development in which Gemmingen played his part.

=== Final years ===
After 1806 Gemingen returned to Mühlbach with his family, spending the last three decades of his life away from public life and increasingly impoverished.   His high level of indebtedness mey have resulted from excessive cash tranasfers and guarnatees on behalf of his impecunious brother in law.   He then attempted to increase his income by increasing the charges on the tenant farmers on the estates.   This met with particularly strong resistance at [[Hoffenheim]] where at one stage troops had to be called in and set on the tenants.   His own financial difficulties led him to forget earlier backing for unjustly treated peasants.   In 1817 the estate at Mühlbach had to be given up and he moved back, briefly, to Hoffenheim, and then to [[Heidelberg]] where, in 1819, he was obliged to file for bankruptcy.   When the [[:de:Gant (Recht)|data]] were computed he was found to have debts in excess of 200,000 Gulden and the Mannheim High Court was obliged to intervene.   His wife died in 1826, and he died ten years later, completely impoverished.   He retained only a small collection of books.   During his final years this once esteemed enlightement write and diplomat fell into a level of obscurity from which his reputation has not yet recovered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8578">{{Thomism}}{{Abortion in the Catholic Church}}The '''principle of double effect'''—also known as the '''rule of double effect'''; the '''doctrine of double effect''', often abbreviated as '''DDE''' or '''PDE''', '''double-effect reasoning'''; or simply '''double effect'''—is a set of ethical criteria which Christian philosophers, and some others, have advocated for evaluating the permissibility of acting when one's otherwise legitimate act (for example, relieving a terminally ill patient's pain) may also cause an effect one would otherwise be obliged to avoid (sedation and a slightly shortened life). The first known example of double-effect reasoning is [[Thomas Aquinas]]' treatment of homicidal self-defense, in his work ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3064.htm#article7 ''Summa Theologiae, IIa-IIae Q. 64, art. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

This set of criteria states that an action having foreseen harmful effects practically inseparable from the good effect is justifiable if the following are true:
* the nature of the act is itself good, or at least morally neutral;
* the agent intends the good effect and does not intend the bad effect either as a means to the good or as an end in itself;
* the good effect outweighs the bad effect in circumstances sufficiently grave to justify causing the bad effect and the agent exercises due diligence to minimize the harm.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Cavanaugh, ''Double-Effect Reasoning: Doing Good and Avoiding Evil'', p.36, Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intentional harm versus side effects==
The principle of double effect is based on the idea that there is a morally relevant difference between an "intended" consequence of an act and one that is foreseen by the actor but not calculated to achieve his motive. So, for example, the principle is invoked to consider the terror bombing of non-combatants having as its goal victory in a legitimate war morally out of bounds, while holding as ethically in bounds an act of strategic bombing that similarly harms non-combatants with foresight  as a side effect of destroying a legitimate military target. Because advocates of double effect propose that consequentially similar acts can be morally different, double effect is most often criticized by [[consequentialism|consequentialists]] who consider the consequences of actions entirely determinative of the action's morality.

In their use of the distinction between intent and foresight without intent, advocates of double effect make three arguments. First, that intent differs from foresight, even in cases in which one foresees an effect as inevitable. Second, that one can apply the distinction to specific sets of cases found in military ethics (terror bombing/strategic bombing), medical ethics (craniotomy/hysterectomy), and social ethics (euthanasia). Third, that the distinction has moral relevance, importance, or significance.

The doctrine consists of four conditions that must be satisfied before an act is morally permissible:

# The ''nature-of-the-act condition.'' The action must be either morally good or indifferent.
# The ''means-end condition.'' The bad effect must not be the means by which one achieves the good effect.
# The ''right-intention condition.'' The intention must be the achieving of only the good effect, with the bad effect being only an unintended side effect.
# The ''proportionality condition.'' The bad effect must not be disproportionate to the good effect.

The second of these four conditions is an application of the more general principle that good ends do not justify evil means.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Timmons, ''Moral Theory: An Introduction'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-8476-9768-7}}), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Medicine===
The principle of double effect is frequently cited in cases of [[pregnancy]] and [[abortion]]. A doctor who believes abortion is always morally wrong may still remove the uterus or [[Fallopian tube|fallopian tubes]] of a pregnant woman, knowing the procedure will cause the death of the [[embryo]] or [[fetus]], in cases in which the woman is certain to die without the procedure (examples cited include aggressive [[uterus|uterine]] [[cancer]] and [[ectopic pregnancy]]). In these cases, the intended effect is to save the woman's life, not to terminate the pregnancy, and the effect of not performing the procedure would result in the greater evil of the death of both the mother and the foetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | title = Doctrine of Double Effect | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/ | editor = Edward N.

In cases of terminally ill patients who would hasten their deaths because of unbearable pain, or whose caregivers would do so for them ([[euthanasia]], [[medical aid in dying]], etc.), a principle of "double effect death" could be applied to justify the deliberate administration of a pain-killer in potentially unsafe doses—not in an attempt to end life but the pain suffered is considered harmful to the patient. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has voiced support for this principle in its deliberations over the constitutionality of medical aid in dying.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vacco v. Quill]]'' and ''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]]'', both in 1997. See: Tucker, Kathryn E., “Legal Advocacy to Improved Care and Expand Options at the End of Life,” in ''Physician-Assisted Dying: The Case for Palliative Care &amp; Patient Choice'', edited by T.E. Quill and M.P. Battin ([[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2004). The Court made it clear that a “medical death” hastened by palliative measures was permissible.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

[[Consequentialism|Consequentialists]], in particular, reject the notion that two acts can differ in their moral permissibility if both have exactly the same consequences, or expected consequences. [[John Stuart Mill]], a nineteenth-century advocate of the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] version of consequentialism, argues that it is a mistake to confuse the standards for right action with a consideration of our motives to perform a right action: "He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble; he who betrays the friend that trusts him, is guilty of a crime, even if his object be to serve another friend to whom he is under greater obligations." According to Mill, scrutiny of motives will show that almost all good behavior proceeds from questionable intentions. Therefore, Mill argues, our moral analysis should ignore matters of motivation, and so we should reject DDE, which appeals to a distinction between intended and [[unintended consequences]].&lt;ref name="JSM"&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]'' (London: Parker, Son and Bourn, 1863), page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill further claims that scrutiny of motives will reveal a man's character, but utilitarianism does not judge character, only the rightness or wrongness of actions.

==Life==
Vujcic was born on 20 July 1960 in the [[Southern and Eastern Serbia|eastern]] [[Serbia]]n city of [[Požarevac]] to father Jefrem and mother Nadežda and it was in Požarevac that he completed his [[primary education|elementary education]].&lt;ref name="Urban Book Circle"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.urbanbookcircle.com/prvoslav-ldquopearserdquo-vujcic.html |publisher=Urban Book Circle |title=Prvoslav Vujčić biography |accessdate=27 July 2013 |date=16 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Vujcic won the Zmaj Award (awarded annually by the [[Association of Writers of Serbia]] for the best book of the year) for his collection of poetry titled ''Pesnik i pesma'' – the award was presented to him by [[Desanka Maksimović]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Večernje novosti]]'' (31 March 2007). "Rodoljubive pesme, pg. 26" {{sr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he visited Canada and the [[United States]] for the first time where he met one of his literary influences [[Charles Bukowski]]. Vujcic then read and presented his poetry with Bukowski on tour for fourteen days in 1977.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette 1989"&gt;''The Canada Gazette: La Gazette du Canada'', Volume 123, Issue 1, Part 1 (in English &amp; French). Queen's Printer. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Vujcic completed his ''[[matura]]'' and graduated from the [[Požarevac Gymnasium]] in 1979. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was the leader of the Požarevac section of the [[Grobari]], the supporters group of [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]].&lt;ref name="Migrating Memories 2010. pp. 306"/&gt; In 1983, Vujcic wrote a book of poetry titled ''Razmišljanja jednog leša'' which was banned by the [[League of Communists of Serbia|Communist government]] in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] by court order in 1983.&lt;ref name="Ginsberg, Whitman, Banned Poetry and a Supermarket in California "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barnonegroup.com/2016/10/ginsberg-whitman-banned-poetry-and.html |author=Bar None Group |title=Ginsberg, Whitman, Banned Poetry and a Supermarket in California |accessdate=17 May 2017 |date=4 October 2016 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1984 in literature|1984]], Vujcic was [[Political prisoners in Yugoslavia|imprisoned]] in [[Tuzla]] for seven days (for his writing and criticizing of Yugoslavia's communist regime) where he wrote his second book of poetry titled ''Kastriranje vetra'' which was also banned by the Communist government.&lt;ref name="Canadian Dust"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arhiv.rs/novinska-clanak/danas/2004/2/7/3B03BBEC53A4C6E7C1256E3300766B43/kanadska-prasina |author=''[[Danas (newspaper)|Danas]]'' |title=Kanadska prašina |accessdate=23 September 2015 |date=7 February 2004 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Otadžbina na Gembl aveniji"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arhiv.rs/novinska-clanak/politika/2004/3/28/B4982374C7526F4CC1256E65004B277C/otadzbina-na-gembl-aveniji |author=''[[Politika]]'' |title=Otadžbina na Gembl aveniji |accessdate=23 September 2015 |date=28 March 2004 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nezavisne Novine ref"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novine.ca/starevesti/Zajednica/srpska_zajednica104.html |author=''Nezavisne Novine'' |title=Promocija knjiga Prvoslava Vujčića |accessdate=2017-10-18 |date=2004-04-27 |language=Serbian |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913182939/http://www.novine.ca/starevesti/Zajednica/srpska_zajednica104.html |archivedate=2017-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1987, Vujcic moved to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;''Reč naroda'' (issue #1927, pg. 9; 3 February 1987). "Portreti – Prvoslav Vujčić – Reč kao osnov" {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival in Canada, he helped raise funds for the construction of the [[Church of Saint Sava]] in [[Belgrade]] and the [[Živojin Mišić]] monument in [[Mionica]].&lt;ref name="Migrating Memories 2010. pp. 306"/&gt; On 28 June 1989, Vujcic helped organize the 600th Anniversary Ceremony commemorating the [[Battle of Kosovo]] throughout Canada.&lt;ref name="Migrating Memories 2010. pp. 306"/&gt; The ''[[Canada Gazette]]'' wrote about Vujcic and his beginnings in Canada in a 1989 edition.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette 1989"/&gt; In 1992, he founded the United Serbs FC soccer club for which he and [[Mike Stojanović]] played (as a child, Vujcic played soccer in the youth categories of FK Železničar Požarevac).&lt;ref&gt;''Srpske novine'' (24 September 1992). "FK Ujedinjeni Srbi, Serbian News #2607, pg. 14" (in Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Vujcic was a contributor to Serbian magazine ''[[Pogledi]]''. In 1999, he was one of the organizers of the Toronto-based demonstrations against the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|bombing of Serbia and Montenegro]]. In terms of the Serbian diaspora, the demonstrations lasted all 78 days only in Toronto.&lt;ref name="Serbia 2005. pp. 47"&gt;''U čast pisaca iz rasejanja'' (in Serbian). Ministry of Diaspora of the Republic of Serbia. 2005. pp. 47–48. {{ISBN|86-906685-0-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vujcic is a member of the [[Association of Writers of Serbia]], the [[Royal Canadian Legion]], the [[Canadian Association of Journalists]], the [[Srpska književna zadruga|Serbian Literary Society]], the [[Association of Writers of Republika Srpska]] and the US-based International Association of Writers.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]]'' (9 April 2005). "Pisac je livac: Prvoslav Vujčić, pg. 18" {{sr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the International Association of Writers&lt;ref name="Migrating Memories 2010. pp. 306"/&gt; named him a Poetry Ambassador of the United States.&lt;ref name="Migrating Memories 2010. pp. 306"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He is also an honourable member of the Desanka Maksimović Serbian Canadian Association. Vujcic is featured in the book ''Moždana veza sa Srbijom, 100 dragulja srpskog rasejanja'' (''Brain Connection with Serbia, 100 Jewels of the Serbian Diaspora)'' by Radivoje Petrović, PhD. The book features the "one hundred most-known Serbs throughout the world-wide Serbian diaspora."&lt;ref&gt;''Moždana veza sa Srbijom, 100 dragulja srpskog rasejanja'' (in Serbian). Global Puls Beograd &amp; Serbian Unity Congress, San Francisco. 2005. pp. 286–288.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also featured on the cover of the Ministry of Diaspora of the Republic of Serbia book called ''U čast pisaca iz rasejanja / In honour of writers in the diaspora'' in which literary critics [[Miodrag Perišić]] and [[Čedomir Mirković]] said that "Vujcic is one of the most significant living Serbian poets and dissidents."&lt;ref name="Serbia 2005. pp. 47"/&gt;

He is the founder of the Urban Book Circle, based in Canada.&lt;ref name="Urban Book Circle"/&gt;

==Reviews==

From [[Joseph A. Tainter]], Professor of Sustainability, Utah State University, "Scientists working in the policy arena are often naïve about the impact of their findings. Producing rational results, scientists expect their research to be rationally accepted. The fundamental problem is that humans are not rational. We are emotional thinkers. Science on the Verge exposes many of the fallacies in science applied to societal problems. No matter how good the science, public issues are always ideological and political." {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} 

From [[Judith Curry]],  climatologist and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] writing on her blog "This book is a very rich resource for grappling with the problems with science in the 21st century – the articles themselves, as well as the extensive references.  I expect to be using this book as a resource for a number future blog posts.  This book deserves a wide audience, and I hope this blog post will help increase its reach."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://judithcurry.com/2016/06/09/science-on-the-verge/|title=Science on the verge {{!}} Climate Etc.|first=Judith|last=Curry|date=9 June 2016|access-date=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese folk religion|expanded=Concepts}}

'''Shangdi''' ({{zh|c=上帝|p=Shàngdì|w=Shang Ti}}), also written simply, "[[Emperor]]" ({{zh|c=帝|p=Dì}}), is the Chinese term for "Supreme Deity" or  "Highest Deity" in the [[Chinese theology|theology of the classical texts]], especially deriving from [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] theology and finding an equivalent in the later ''[[Tian]]'' ("Heaven" or "Great Whole") of [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] theology.{{sfnb|Eno|2008|p=70}}

Although in Chinese religion the usage of "Tian" to refer to the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] [[God]] of the [[universe]] is predominant, "Shangdi" continues to be used in a variety of traditions, including certain [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical schools]],{{sfnb|Chang|2000}} certain strains of [[Confucianism]],{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=457}} some [[Chinese salvationist religions]] (notably [[Yiguandao]]) and [[Protestantism in China|Chinese Protestant Christianity]]. In addition, it is common to use such term among contemporary and secular Chinese, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese societies typically for a singular universal deity and a non-religion translation for the God in Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewslens.com/post/313239/|title=《死期大公開》上帝一家難念的經 - The News Lens 關鍵評論網|first=|last=放映週報|date=23 April 2016|website=thenewslens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Shang Di" is the [[pinyin]] [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] of two [[Chinese characters]]. The first {{ndash}} {{lang|zh|{{linktext|上}}}}, ''Shàng'' {{ndash}} means "high", "highest", "first", "primordial"; the second {{ndash}} {{lang|zh|{{linktext|帝}}}}, ''Dì'' {{ndash}} is typically considered as a short hand for ''huangdi'' （皇帝）in modern Chinese, the title of the [[emperors of China]] first employed by [[Qin Shi Huang]], and is usually translated as "emperor". The word itself is derived from [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Three "Huang" and Five "Di"]], including [[Yellow Emperor]] (Huangdi 黃帝), the mythological originator of the [[China|Chinese civilization]] and the ancestor of the Chinese race. However, 帝 refers to the High God of Shang, thus means "deity" (manifested god), {{sfnb|Chang|2000}}. Thus, the name ''Shangdi'' should be translated as "Highest Deity", but also have the implied meaning of "Primordial Deity" or "First Deity" in Classical Chinese. The deity preceded the title and the emperors of China were named after him in their role as ''[[Chinese sovereign|Tianzi]]'', the sons of Heaven. In the classical texts the highest conception of the heavens is frequently identified with Shang Di, who is described somewhat anthropomorphically. He is also associated with the pole star. The conceptions of the Supreme Ruler (Shang Di) and of the Sublime Heavens (Huang-t'ien)afterward coalesce or absorb each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religions of the World:Their Nature and their History|last=Clemen|first=Carl|publisher=Cosmos Publications|year=2005|isbn=81-7755-927-3|location=New Delhi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Shang dynasty===
[[File:Shang-Orakelknochen excerpt adjusted for contrast.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Oracle bone script]], the earliest known form of [[Chinese characters|Chinese]].]]
The earliest references to Shangdi are found in [[oracle bone]] inscriptions of the [[Shang Dynasty]] in the 2nd millennium BC, although the later work ''[[Classic of History]]'' claims yearly sacrifices were made to him by [[Emperor Shun]], even before the [[Xia Dynasty]].

Shangdi was regarded as the ultimate spiritual power by the ruling elite of the [[Huaxia]] during the [[Shang dynasty]]: he was believed to control victory in battle, success or failure of harvests, weather conditions such as the floods of the [[Yellow River]], and the fate of the kingdom. Shangdi seems to have ruled a [[Chinese pantheon|hierarchy of other gods]] controlling nature, as well as the [[Chinese ancestor worship|spirits of the deceased]].&lt;ref name="Zhao, Yanxia 2010. p. 154"&gt;Zhao, Yanxia. ''Chinese Religion: A Contextual Approach.'' 2010. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were later mirrored or carried on by the [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[Jade Emperor]] and his [[celestial bureaucracy]].

Shangdi was probably more [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] than [[immanence|immanent]], only working through lesser gods.&lt;ref name="Zhao, Yanxia 2010. p. 154"/&gt; Shangdi was considered too distant to be worshiped directly by ordinary mortals. Instead, the Shang kings proclaimed that Shangdi had made himself accessible through the souls of their royal ancestors,&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane D. Fowler, Merv Fowler, 2008, Chinese religions: beliefs and practices, Sussex Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; both in the legendary past and in recent generations as the departed Shang kings joined him in the afterlife. The emperors could thus successfully entreat Shangdi directly.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the oracle bone inscriptions record these petitions, usually praying for rain&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 173&lt;/ref&gt; but also seeking approval from Shangdi for state action.

===Zhou dynasty===
In the later Shang and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou dynasties]], Shangdi was conflated with [[Tian|Heaven]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|天}}}}, ''[[Tian|Tiān]]'').&lt;ref name = b220211&gt;{{citation | contribution = Shangdi | year = 2011 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/538488/Shangdi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Duke of Zhou]] justified [[Battle of Muye|his clan's usurpation]] through the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], which proposed that the protection of Shangdi was not connected to their clan membership but by their just governance. Shangdi was not just a tribal but instead an unambiguously good moral force, exercising its power according to exacting standards.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Book of Documents]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It could thus be lost and even "inherited" by a new dynasty, provided they upheld the proper rituals.

Nonetheless, the connection of many rituals with the [[Zi (surname)|Shang clan]] meant that Shang nobles continued to rule several locations (despite their rebellions) and to serve as court advisors and priests. The Duke of Zhou even created an [[Luoyang|entire ceremonial city]] along strict cosmological principals to house the Shang aristocracy and the [[Nine Tripod Cauldrons|nine tripods]] representing Huaxia sovereignty; the Shang were then charged with maintaining the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]''. Likewise, the Shang's lesser houses, the [[Four occupations#The shi (士)|''shi'' knightly class]], developed directly into the learned Confucian gentry and scholars who advised the Zhou rulers on courtly etiquette and ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;"Chinese Philosophy". China Renmin Univ., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Five Classics|Confucian classics]] carried on and ordered the earlier traditions, including the worship of Shangdi. All of them include references:

{| class="wikitable"

|}

The [[Four Books]] mention Shangdi as well but, as it is a later compilation, the references are much more sparse and abstract. Shangdi appears most commonly in earlier works: this pattern may reflect increasing rationalization of Shangdi over time, the shift from a known and arbitrary tribal god to a more abstract and philosophical concept,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Book of Documents]] says: "August Heaven has no partisan affections: it supports only the virtuous".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' says: "Unless one is virtuous, the people will not be in harmony and the spirits will not partake of one's offerings. What the spirits are attracted to is one's virtue".&lt;/ref&gt; or his conflation and absorption by other deities.

===Han dynasty===
By the time of the [[Han dynasty]], the influential [[Confucianism|Confucian]] scholar [[Zheng Xuan]] glossed: "''Shangdi'' is another name for [[Tian|Heaven]]". [[Dong Zhongshu]] said: "Heaven is the ultimate authority, the king of gods who should be admired by the king".&lt;ref&gt;Dong Zhongshu. ''Chunqiu Fanlu''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later eras, he was commonly known by the name "Heavenly Ruling Highest Deity" (皇天上帝, ''Huángtiān Shàngdì'') and, in this usage, he is especially conflated with the Taoist [[Jade Emperor]].

==Identification==
{{Further information|Chinese theology}}

===The Shang progenitor===
In Shang sources, Di is already described as the supreme ordainer of the events which occur in nature, such as wind, lightning and thunder, and in human affairs and politics. All the gods of nature are conceived as his envoys or manifestations. Shang sources also attest his cosmological [[Wufang Shangdi|Five Ministries]].{{sfnb|Eno|2008|p=71}} Di, or Tian, as later texts explain, did not receive [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] for being too remote for living humans to sacrifice to directly. Instead, an intermediary such as an ancestor was necessary to convey to Di the offerings of the living.{{sfnb|Eno|2008|p=72}}

According to some prominent scholars, including Guo Moruo, Shangdi was originally identical to Ku (or Kui) or Diku ("''[[Divus]]'' Ku"), the [[progenitor]] (first ancestor) of the Zi (子) lineage, the founders of the Shang dynasty, attested in the ''[[Shiji]]'' and other texts.{{sfnb|Eno|2008|p=72}} According to this interpretation, this identification had profound political implications, because it meant that the earthly Shang kings were themselves by birth aspects of divinity.{{sfnb|Eno|2008|p=73}}

Further evidence from Shang sources suggests that there wasn't a complete identification between the two, as Di controls spirits of nature, while Kui does not; Di is frequently pictured sending down "approvals", while Kui is never so pictured; and Kui received cult, while Di did not. Moreover, Kui is frequently appealed in "horizontal" relationship with other powers, undermining any portrait of him as the apex of the pantheon.{{sfnb|Eno|2008|p=73}}

===Shangdi as the celestial pole===
David Pankenier has studied the astral connections of Shangdi, drawing on a view that interest in the sky was a focal character of the religious practices of the Shang, but also of the earlier [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] and [[Erlitou culture]]s. Especially intriguing is the fact that palatial and ceremonial structures of these cultures were carefully aligned to the [[celestial pole]] and the procession of [[pole star]]s. Pankenier notes that the true celestial pole lies in a sky template which is vacant of significant stars, and that the various pole stars are those nearest to this vacant apex which is of crucial importance.{{sfnb|Eno|2008|pp=73-74}}

He illustrates how the Shang [[oracle bone script|oracular script]] for Di can be projected on the north pole template of the ancient sky in such a way that its extremity points correspond with the visible star, while the intersection of the linear axes at the centre will map to the vacant celestial pole. Pankenier argues that the supreme Di was identified with the celestial pole, an idea familiar in later stages of Chinese religion, linking with the ''Tàiyī'' 太一 ("Great One") fully documented as early as the 4th century BCE.{{sfnb|Eno|2008|p=74}}

The interpretation of Shangdi as the celestial pole, Taiyi and as Ku the progenitor of the Shang is not contradictory. Feng Shi argues that Ku and Di are indeed identical. The Shang probably deliberately identified their ancestor with a universal god recognized in different regions and local cultures in order to legitimize their power.{{sfnb|Eno|2008|p=75}}

===Contemporary Confucianism===
Contemporary Confucian theologians have emphasised differences between the Confucian idea of Shangdi, conceived as both [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[immanent]], and act only as a governor of the world, and the Christian idea of God, which they conceived contrary to those of Christian as a deity that is completely otherwordly (transcendent) and is merely a creator of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Zhōng Shǐ-shēng, 天学初征: "天是「統御世間、主善罰惡之天，即《詩》、《易》、《中庸》所稱上帝是也」，但這個主宰之天只是「治世，而非生世，譬如帝王，但治民而非生民也」"&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=457}}

As mentioned above, sacrifices offered to Shangdi by the king are claimed by traditional Chinese histories to predate the Xia dynasty. The [[Oracle bones#Discovery|surviving archaeological record]] shows that by the Shang, the [[scapula|shoulder blades]] of sacrificed oxen were used to send questions or communication through fire and smoke to the divine realm, a practice known as [[scapulimancy]]. The heat would cause the bones to crack and royal diviners would interpret the marks as Shangdi's response to the king. Inscriptions used for divination were buried into special orderly pits, while those that were for practice or records were buried in common [[midden]]s after use.&lt;ref&gt;Xu Yahui. Caltonhill, Mark &amp; al., trans. ''Ancient Chinese Writing: Oracle Bone Inscriptions from the Ruins of Yin.'' [[Academia Sinica]]. [[National Palace Museum]] (Taipei), 2002. Govt. Publ. No. 1009100250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Shangdi or his later names, the deity received sacrifices from the ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty annually at a great [[Temple of Heaven]] in the imperial capital. Following the principles of [[fengshui|Chinese geomancy]], this would always be located in the southern quarter of the city.{{efn|For instance, the Classic of History records the Duke of Zhou building an altar in the southern part of Luo.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}}} During the ritual, a completely healthy bull would be slaughtered and presented as an animal sacrifice to Shangdi.{{efn|Although the Duke of Zhou is presented as sacrificing two.}} The ''[[Book of Rites]]'' states the sacrifice should occur on the "[[summer solstice|longest day]]" on a round-mound altar.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} The altar would have three tiers: the highest for Shangdi and the [[Son of Heaven]]; the second-highest for the sun and moon; and the lowest for the natural gods such as the stars, clouds, rain, wind, and thunder.

It is important to note that Shangdi is never represented with either images or idols. Instead, in the center building of the Temple of Heaven, in a structure called the "Imperial Vault of Heaven", a "spirit tablet" (神位, shénwèi) inscribed with the name of Shangdi is stored on the throne, ''Huangtian Shangdi'' (皇天上帝). During an annual sacrifice, the emperor would carry these tablets to the north part of the Temple of Heaven, a place called the "Prayer Hall For Good Harvests", and place them on that throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jsdj.com/luyou/tp2/BJTT12.jpg |title = JSDJ |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051214105152/http://www.jsdj.com/luyou/tp2/BJTT12.jpg |archivedate = 2005-12-14 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflation with Concept of Singular Universal God===
{{see also|Chinese Rites controversy|Chinese names for the God of Abrahamic religions|Unknown God}}

It was during Ming and Qing dynasty, when Roman Catholicism was introduced by [[Jesuit]] Priest [[Matteo Ricci]], that the idea of "Shangdi" started to be applied to the [[God in Christianity|Christian conception of God]].

While initially he utilized the term ''Tianzhu'', Ricci gradually changed the translation into "Shangdi" instead.&lt;ref&gt;“上帝給人雙目、雙耳、雙手、雙足，欲兩友相助，方爲事有成矣。”《交友論》,1595&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“上帝者，生物原始，宰物本主也。”《二十五言》,1599&lt;/ref&gt; His usage of Shangdi was contested by Confucians, as they believed that the concept of ''Tian'' and "Shangdi" is different from that of Christian's God: Zhōng Shǐ-shēng, through his books,&lt;ref&gt;天学初征&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;天学再征&lt;/ref&gt; stated that Shangdi only governs, while Christian's God is a creator, and thus differ.&lt;ref&gt;程小娟：《God的汉译史——争论、接受与启示》，社会科学文献出版社，2013年&lt;/ref&gt; Ricci's translation also invited the displeasure of [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and that of the Roman Curia; On March 19, 1715, [[Pope Clement XI]] released the Edict ''Ex Illa Die'', stating that Catholics must use "Tianzhu" instead of "Shangdi" for Christianity's God.

When [[Protestantism]] entered China in the mid of 19th century, the Protestant missionaries also encountered a similar issue; some preferred the term "Shangdi", while some preferred the term ''Shen'' (god). A conference held in 1877 in Shanghai, discussing the translation issue, also believed that "Shangdi" of Confucianism and the Christian concept of God are different in nature.&lt;ref&gt;艾約瑟譯《各省教師集議記略》，載李天綱編校《萬國公報文選》，北京：生活·讀書·新知三聯書店，1998年，第22頁。&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by the 20th century, most British missionaries, some [[Catholics]], [[Chinese Orthodox Church|Chinese Orthodox Christians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodox.cn/localchurch/200406ancientcnhist_en.htm|title=Ancient Chinese History in Light of the Book of Genesis|author=|date=|website=www.orthodox.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Evangelicals]] preferred Shangdi as a connection with Chinese native [[monotheism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[James Legge|Legge, James]], The Religions of China, Hodder and Stoughton, 1880, p24-25: "'He sacrificed specifically, but with the ordinary forms, to ShangTi' -that is, we have seen, to God."&lt;/ref&gt; with some further the argument by linking it with the [[unknown god]] as described in bible passage of {{bibleref|Acts|17:23-31|31}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rlhymersjr.com/Online_Sermons_Chinese/2012/092912PM_TheUnknownGod.html|title=Sermons in Traditional Chinese: THE UNKNOWN GOD|author=|date=|website=www.rlhymersjr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzimxWlnh8YC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=%E6%9C%AA%E8%AD%98%E4%B9%8B%E7%A5%9E%E4%B8%8A%E5%B8%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DxRsF2XPfv&amp;sig=zC3h5h_AAAJmTbFBapc1l39s_rg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4ipKq4qrMAhUMsIMKHZ1hBHcQ6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%E6%9C%AA%E8%AD%98%E4%B9%8B%E7%A5%9E%E4%B8%8A%E5%B8%9D&amp;f=false|title=Confucian Christian Theology|first=Tian|last=Tongxin|date=|publisher=Academic Press Corporation|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics preferred to avoid it, due to compromises with the local authority in order to do their missions, as well as fear such translation may associate the Christian God to Chinese polytheism.&lt;ref name=sg282211&gt;{{citation | first = Archie CC | last = Lee | title = God's Asian Names: Rendering the Biblical God in Chinese | publisher = SBL Forum | date = Oct 2005 | url = http://sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleID=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, through the secular Chinese-language media, the Chinese word of "Shangdi" and "Tian" are frequently used to as a translation for the singular universal deity with minimal religious attachment to the Christian idea of God, while Confucians and intellectuals in contemporary mainland China and Taiwan attempt to realign the term to its original meaning. The Catholics officially use the term [[Tianzhu (Chinese name of God)|Tianzhu]] (Chinese: 天主, Tiānzhǔ), lit. "The Lord of Heaven", while Evangelicals typically utilize Shangdi (上帝) and/or Shen (神, "The God").

'''''The Rebel''''' ({{lang-fr|L'Homme révolté}}) is a 1951 book-length [[essay]] by [[Albert Camus]], which treats both the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and the historical development of [[rebellion]] and [[revolution]] in [[society|societies]], especially [[Western Europe]]. Camus relates writers and artists as diverse as [[Epicurus]] and [[Lucretius]], the [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Max Stirner]], [[André Breton]], and others in an integrated, historical portrait of man in revolt. Examining both rebellion and revolt, which may be seen as the same phenomenon in personal and social frames, Camus examines several '[[Counterculture|countercultural]]' figures and movements from the history of Western thought and art, noting the importance of each in the overall development of revolutionary thought and philosophy.  This work has received ongoing interest, influencing modern philosophers and authors such as [[Paul Berman]] and others.

Fred Rosen has examined the influence of ideas of [[Simone Weil]] on Camus' thinking in ''The Rebel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rosen | first=Fred | title=Marxism, Mysticism, and Liberty: The Influence of Simone Weil on Albert Camus | journal=Political Theory | volume=7 | issue=3 | pages=301–319 | date=August 1979 | doi=10.1177/009059177900700302|jstor = 190943}}&lt;/ref&gt;  George F Selfer has analysed parallels between Camus and Friedrich Nietzsche in philosophical aesthestics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Selfer | first=George F | title=The Existential vs. the Absurd: The Aesthetics of Nietzsche and Camus | journal=The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism | volume=32 | issue=3 | pages=415–421 | date=Spring 1974 |jstor = 428426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
One of Camus' primary arguments in ''The Rebel'' concerns the motivation for rebellion and revolution. While the two acts - which can be interpreted from Camus' writing as states of being - are radically different in most respects, they both stem from a basic human rejection of normative justice. If human beings become disenchanted with contemporary applications of justice, Camus suggests that they rebel. This rebellion, then, is the product of a basic contradiction between the human mind's unceasing quest for clarification and the apparently meaningless nature of the world. Described by Camus as "[[Absurdism|absurd]]," this latter perception must be examined with what Camus terms "lucidity." Camus concludes that such an 'absurdist' sensibility contradicts itself because when it claims to believe in nothing, it believes in its own protest and in the value of the protester's life. Therefore, this sensibility is logically a "point of departure" that irresistibly "exceeds itself." In the inborn impulse to rebel, on the other hand, we can deduce values that enable us to determine that murder and oppression are illegitimate and conclude with "hope for a new creation." 

Another prominent theme in ''The Rebel'', which is tied to the notion of incipient rebellion, is the inevitable failure of attempts at human perfection. Through an examination of various titular revolutions, and in particular the [[French Revolution]], Camus argues that most revolutions involved a fundamental denial of both history and transcendental values. Such revolutionaries aimed to kill God. In the French Revolution, for instance, this was achieved through the execution of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and subsequent eradication of the [[divine right of kings]]. The subsequent rise of [[utopia]]n and [[Materialism|materialist]] idealism sought "[[End of history|the end of history]]." Because this end is unattainable, according to Camus, terror ensued as the revolutionaries attempted to coerce results. This culminated in the "temporary" enslaving of people in the name of their future liberation. Notably, Camus' reliance on non-secular sentiment does not involve a defense of religion; indeed, the replacement of divinely-justified morality with pragmatism simply represents Camus' apotheosis of transcendental, moral values.

Faced with the manifest injustices of human existence on one hand, and the poor substitute of revolution on the other, Camus' rebel seeks to fight for justice without abandoning transcendental values, including the principle of the intrinsic value of human life. Consequently, of all the modern revolutionaries, Camus admires the "fastidious assassins", namely the Russian terrorists led by Kalyayev, active in the early twentieth century were prepared to offer their own lives as payment for the lives they took, rather than licensing others to kill others.

A third is that of [[crime]], as Camus discusses how rebels who get carried away lose touch with the original basis of their rebellion and offer various defenses of crime through various historical epochs.

At the end of the book, Camus espouses the possible moral superiority of the ethics and political plan of [[syndicalism]].  He grounds this politics in a wider "midday thought" which opposes love of this life, and an unrelativisable normative commitment to fellow human beings, against ideological promises of the other world, end of history, or triumph of an alleged master race.

[[File:Stylised atom with three Bohr model orbits and stylised nucleus.png|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Stylised atom as an emblem of [[science]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Emb logo.png|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;An emblem of the [[Theosophical Society]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
Immediately after formation the [[Theosophical Society]] in 1875, the founders of modern '''[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]''' were aimed to show that their ideas can be confirmed by '''[[science]]'''. According to professor [[Olav Hammer]], at the end of the 19th century the Theosophical doctrine has acquired in Europe and America wide popularity, thanking to numerous publications, which contained its simplified exposition and, in particular, asserted that Theosophy "includes" both science and religion, thus, positioning itself as "a scientific religion," or "a religious science."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=222}}{{refn|group=note|[[Helena Blavatsky]] argued that ancient civilizations owned wisdom based on "unity of science and religion."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=10}}}} Professor [[Joscelyn Godwin]] wrote that the Theosophical Society was formed at the "crucial historical moment when it seemed possible to unite science and [[occultism]], West and East" in modern Theosophy, adding into western civilization the [[esoteric]] eastern wisdom.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xv}}

== Scientism of Theosophy ==
For the modern Theosophy, which Hammer considered as a standard of the esoteric tradition, conventional science is called upon to play "two diametrically opposite roles." On the one hand, Theosophy has always expressed its clearly negative attitude towards it. On the other hand, in the process of building the occult doctrine, it gave to certain fragments of scientific discourse the status of valued elements. In this case, science was not used as an object of criticism, but as "a basis of legitimacy and source of doctrinal elements." Thus, in Hammer's opinion, the main goal was achieved: the doctrine acquired a "scientistic" appearance.{{sfnm|Hammer|2003|1pp=203, 204|Asprem|2013|2p=408}}{{refn|group=note|Lydia Fesenkova wrote: "Modern esotericism show itself usually in a scientistic wear... It appeals to science, proclaiming the principle of the unity of science, religion, and philosophy."{{sfn|Фесенкова|2003|pp=84–85}} However, in opinion of professor [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], the "scientistic aspect of modem esotericism is much more than mere terminology; it reflects an ongoing effort to bridge the worlds of [[spirit]] and physical matter."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=235}}}}

The Theosophical Society proclaimed its third main task, "To investigate the unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in man."{{sfnm|Kuhn|1992|1p=113|Hammer|2003|2p=218}} Thus, it set itself one of its goals to investigate phenomena whose existence itself is highly controversial, that is, the very premises of Theosophy have become "fertile ground" for the search for "scientistic formulations." Scientism and the ambivalence relation to science were already evident in the first Theosophical publications. It can be seen in both [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] early articles, and in ''[[Isis Unveiled]],'' the book that became the "first full-scale attempt" to create the Theosophical doctrine, where she stated that Theosophy does not contradict science, but is, in fact, a "higher form of science", in comparison with what is usually understood by this term.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=219}} This statement by Blavatsky is quoted in Hammer's thesis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The exercise of ''[[Magic (paranormal)|magical]]'' power is the exercise of ''natural'' powers, but superior to the ordinary functions of Nature. A miracle is not a violation of the laws of Nature, except for ignorant people. Magic is but a ''science,'' a profound knowledge of the Occult forces in Nature, and of the laws governing the visible or the invisible world... A powerful [[mesmerism|mesmerizer]], profoundly learned in his science, such as [[Baron du Potet]], Regazzoni, Pietro d'Amicis of Bologna, are ''magicians,'' for they have become the [[adept]]s, the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiated]] ones, into the great mystery of our Mother Nature."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1966|1p=137|Hammer|2003|2p=220}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A dual relation of Blavatsky to science remained unchanged, in Hammer's opinion, throughout her theosophical career. It was manifested also in the [[The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett|mahatma letters]] and later continued in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]].''{{refn|group=note|Hammer, apparently, considered Blavatsky the author, including the letters of the mahatmas. However, according to [[Charles Leadbeater|Leadbeater]], the letters were not written or dictated directly by the mahatmas, as the Theosophists supposed, "but were the work of pupils carrying out general directions given to them by the Masters."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=807}}}} In one of the letters, terms and theories of the conventional science are characterized with words such as "misleading", "vacillating", "uncertain" and "incomplete".{{sfnm|Barker|1924|1p=62|Hammer|2003|2p=220}} It is this last word that is most important, that is, "science is a half-truth." The Theosophical doctrine "not so much" denies the truth of science, how much condemns its inability to explain an essence of the [[spirit]]ual processes that "are supposedly the real causes" of the physical and chemical phenomena.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=221}} According to Hammer, "The Secret Doctrine" is completely "imbued with the rhetoric of scientism". Although the "basic cosmological" concept in this work ultimately derives "from ancient wisdom" that was received by Blavatsky, as she claimed, from her "Masters," many of the details of this declassified cosmology are accompanied by references to archaeological discoveries, modern biological theories such as evolutionary theory of [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], etc. She believed that the positioning of Theosophy in relation to science is of great importance, and the third parts of both the 1st and 2nd volumes of her book have the common heading ''Science and the Secret Doctrine Contrasted.'' These sections are devoted both to the refutation of the conventional science, and to the search in it the support of occult teachings.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=221}} Blavatsky repeatedly returned to the assertion that modern physical sciences point to the same reality as the esoteric doctrines:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If there is anything on earth like progress, Science will some day have to give up, ''nolens volens,'' such monstrous ideas as her physical, self-guiding ''laws''—void of soul and [[Spirit]],—and then turn to the occult teachings. It has done so already, however altered are the title-page and revised editions of the Scientific Catechism."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1pp=506–507|Hammer|2003|2p=262}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blavatsky generally did not reject science, suggesting the possibility of "reconciliation" of science and Theosophy.{{refn|group=note|[[Nikolai Berdyaev]] wrote, "Contemporary popular theosophy is very deferential towards science... From the natural sciences it borrows a naive realism."{{sfn|Berdyaev}}}} She believed that they have "important common grounds", and that the "weaknesses" of the traditional science are only its "temporary shortcomings." The main point of contact, which unites science and "occultism" against the common enemy, a dogmatic religion, was the refusal to recognize "unknowable, absolutely transcendent causes." Theosophical cosmos appears and disappears in an infinite sequence of "cycles of evolution and involution." This is [[pantheism| pantheistic]] position, because the beginning of this process does not require "transcendent God."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=265}} Hammer has cited:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Well may a man of science ask himself, 'What power is it that directs each atom?' &lt;...&gt; [[Theism|Theists]] would solve the question by answering 'God'; and would solve nothing philosophically. Occultism answers on its own pantheistic grounds."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1p=549|Hammer|2003|2p=265}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Theosophical criticism ==
In his thesis Arnold Kalnitsky wrote that, criticizing science of the 19th century, the Theosophists claimed on the "futility" its attempts to adequately explain "the greatest enigmas" of Universe. They evaluated the "occult based" hypotheses as more accurate than those presented by science.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=312}}

Hammer wrote Blavatsky defined her position regarding science "from the beginning of her theosophical career." Thus, the ''Mahatma Letters'' contain, in his opinion, the "rather unsystematic" accusations the modern science and the fragments of the occult doctrine, supposedly "far superior" the scientific ideas of the day. The essence of Blavatsky's "later argument" is anticipated in the next passage from letter No. 11: "Modern science is our best ally. Yet it is generally that same science which is made the enemy to break our heads with."{{sfnm|Barker|1924|1p=63|Hammer|2003|2p=261|Asprem|2013|3p=405}} She constantly condemned the traditional science as "limited, [[materialism|materialistic]] and prejudiced" and blamed in this the famous thinkers and scholars.{{refn|group=note|A Russian Indologist [[Alexander Senkevich]] wrote that in the 19th century, an idea of the omnipotence of science became the main one, and "men believed in steam's force more than in virtue of preaching."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=157}}}} [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] was the first among the culprits "due to the materialism of his method, 'the general tenor' of his writing and, more specifically, his misunderstanding of spiritual evolution." [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] materialist error allegedly consisted in the fact that in his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of gravitation]] the primary was the power, not the influence of the "spiritual causes." In addition, she repeated the baseless, according to Hammer, assertion that Newton came to his ideas after reading [[Jakob Böhme|Böhme]].{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1pp=481, 490|Hammer|2003|2p=267}}{{refn|group=note|In the third chapter of ''Isis'' (Vol. 1) named by its author ''The blind leaders of the blind'' she particularly sharply criticized the two "high priests" of the scientific materialism [[John Tyndall|Tyndall]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]].{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=73–98|Lachman|2012|2p=174|Asprem|2013|3p=409}}}}

An American author Joseph Tyson wrote that, according to Blavatsky, the mechanistic science's adepts of her time were the "animate corpses." She wrote that "they have no spiritual sight because their spirits have left them." She called their hypotheses "the [[sophism]]s suggested by cold reason," which future generations would banish to the "limbo of exploded myths."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=306, 318, 621|Tyson|2006|2p=388}} Also [[Henry Olcott]] proclaimed that the Theosophists must break "the walls of incredulous and despotic Western science."{{sfnm|Olcott|2011|1p=100|Tyson|2006|2p=387}}{{refn|group=note|[[Vladimir Trefilov]] wrote, "The main difference between the Theosophical science and the usual modern science is seen in the fact that the latter has to do only with scraps of a whole—with the physical phenomena of this and other worlds, with that that can be performed through the physical brain of man and his feeling."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}}}}{{refn|group=note|Adhering to a line of the initial theosophical criticism, [[#Theosophists-scientists|Edi Bilimoria]]{{sfn|Theowiki}} suggested to those modern scientists who claim that they investigate and unravel "the 'mind of God' would do better to probe into their own minds to discover the arrogance and philosophic naivete of such 'investigations'."{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=159}}}}

Some scientists, according to Blavatsky, were more prone to spiritual, and she "selectively approved" them. "The positive side of [[René Descartes|Descartes']] work" was supposedly his faith in the "magnetic doctrine" and [[alchemy]], although he was a "worshipper of matter." She was admired by [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] method, "combining scientific and esoteric thought."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=206, 207|Hammer|2003|2p=267}} She gave also some excerpts from Newton's most "speculative" works, where he supports a "spiritualized" approach to gravity. Thus, according to her words, these "greatest scientists" rediscovered the esoteric knowledge already available to "Western occultists including [[Paracelsus]]... [[Kabbalah|kabbalists]] and alchemists."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1p=490|Hammer|2003|2p=267}}{{refn|group=note|Bilimoria classified Newton as a "greatest mystic and Occultist" of England.{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=150}}}}

A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] wrote Blavatsky claimed in ''The Secret Doctrine'' that occultism does not combat with conventional science, when "the conclusions of the latter are grounded on a substratum of unassailable fact." But when its opponents try "to wrench the formation of [[Kosmos]]...  from Spirit, and attribute all to blind matter, that the Occultists claim the right to dispute and call in question their theories." She stated that "science is limited" to researching one aspect of human life that relates to the sphere of material nature. "There are other aspects" of this life—[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], supersensory, for the knowledge of which science has no tools. Science devotes its strength to the study of vital forces, which are expressed in a phenomenal or sensual area. Consequently, it sees nothing but the residual effects of such forces. "These are but the shadow of reality," Blavatsky claimed. Thus, science deals "only with appearances" and hints of life, and that is all that it is capable of until the postulates of the occult are recognized. Science is tied to "the plane of effects", but occultism is take to "the plane of causes." Science "studies the expression of life", esotericism sees life itself. So that the scientist can learn "the elements of real causality", he will have to develop in himself such [[siddhi|abilities]] which today almost all Europeans and Americans absolutely lack. There is no other way to get enough facts to substantiate his conclusions.{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1pp=477–78|Kuhn|1992|2p=258}}

Tim Rudbøg wrote in his thesis: "A large part of Blavatsky's critique of modern science consisted in the critical view that many of these so-called new discoveries and theories were actually known to the ancients, but lost to the moderns due to their arrogance. In other words, any 'new' discovery was, to a large extent, simply 'old wine in new bottles'."{{sfn|Rudbøg|2012|p=276}}

== Theosophical evolutionism ==
Modern Theosophy, as professor [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] stated, "adapting contemporary scientific ideas," raised the concept of "[[spiritual evolution]] through countless worlds and eras."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=211}} According to professor [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Donald Lopez]], the occult "system of spiritual evolution" was more profound and advanced than that proposed by [[Charles Darwin]]. Theosophists accepted his theory but rejected the assertion that life originated from matter, and not from spirit.{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=11}}{{refn|group=note|In 1963 a British chemist [[#Theosophists-scientists|Lester Smith]]{{sfn|Theosopedia}} said, "There is a tendency to believe that the whole secret of life is wrapped up in this [[genetic code]], so that  when it has been completely unravelled it will be possible to create life... We should proclaim firmly  that the biochemists are not studying Life itself, but its mechanisms, the almost unbelievably intricate and delicate tools it uses for its purposes."{{sfn|Smith|1963|p=18}} An [[:ru:Действительные члены РАН|academician]] [[Erik M. Galimov|Galimov]] stated that [[Darwinism]] proved unproductive "in reference to the problem of the origin of life."{{sfn|Галимов|2001|p=212}} Lydia Fesenkova noted that from the positions of the natural sciences, Darwinism now looks like a "hypothesis that greatly simplifies the real state of things," so his conclusions find "constantly-increasing objections."{{sfn|Фесенкова|2007|p=128}}}}

Kuhn wrote that, according to Blavatsky, between the spiritual evolution of man and his physical development "there is an abyss which will not be easily crossed by any man in the full possession of his intellectual faculties." [[Evolution|Physical development]], "as modern Science teaches it, is a subject for open controversy; spiritual and moral development on the same lines is the insane dream of a crass materialism."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=650|Kuhn|1992|2p=255}} Darwinian theory and the materialistic science suggest that the development of matter in an organic form leads to the emergence of the psyche and intelligence as the products of two elements: matter and energy. Occultism claims that such a process can lead to the creation of physical forms only. Instead of considering intellect and consciousness as properties of evolved organisms, Theosophy speaks of a "spiritual evolution" as a concomitant biological one and associated with it. "Evolution in its higher aspect" can't be explained if its factors are reduced to blind material forces arising under the impact of the "mechanical influences of environment."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|pp=253, 254}}{{refn|group=note|According to Indian philosophy, there are "other worlds than that which our senses reveal to us, other senses than those which we share with the lower animals, other forces than those of material nature."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1948b|p=373}}}}

An American author [[Gary Lachman]] wrote that, according to Blavatsky, the "scientific" theory of evolution reflects only that part of it that takes place in our present physical world. [[Darwinism]] does not take into account what happens before and after. In her opinion, Darwin "begins his evolution of species at the lowest point and traces upward. His only mistake may be that he applies his system at the wrong end." After passing through the period of necessary separation, the spirit returns to itself enriched during its journey. Consequently, the biological evolution is not a "random" event that could "occur" due to some "rare" combination of chemical matters and then continued driven by the need for survival and suitable [[mutation]]s. Blavatsky claimed that, not spirit is in matter, but on the contrary, ''matter'' "clings temporarily to spirit."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=428, 429|Lachman|2012|2p=171}}{{refn|group=note|Senkevich wrote that, according to Darwin, the three main factors: [[Genetic variability|variability]], [[heredity]], and [[natural selection]] were responsible for evolution; thus, "the pragmatic West" with its mundane approach to life simply lacked "common sense, to gain faith in the evolution of [[soul]] or consciousness."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=435}}}} Thus, the spirit (or consciousness) is primary, and matter is a temporary means used in its "work." According to Theosophy, evolution is the basic phenomenon of the Universe that does not coincide with the materialistic vision, which, in Blavatsky's opinion, is "a hideous, ceaseless procession of sparks of cosmic matter created by ''no one''... floating onward from ''nowhence''... and it rushes ''nowhither''."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=xviii|Lachman|2012|2p=171}} She proposed the kabalistic scheme of evolution: "A stone becomes a plant; a plant a beast; a beast a ''man''; a man a ''spirit''; and the spirit a god." In this scheme: "Each perfected species in the physical evolution only affords more scope to the directing intelligence to act within the improved nervous system."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1pp=301, 425|Lachman|2012|2p=171}}

According to words of Dimitry Drujinin, Olcott claimed, "Theosophy shows the student that evolution is a fact, but that it has not been partial and incomplete as Darwin's theory makes it."{{sfnm|Olcott|1885|1p=250|Дружинин|2012|2p=79}} Professor [[I. K. Taimni|Iqbal Taimni]]{{sfn|Harris, Swarup}} wrote that, it is not known to science that the main goal "of the evolution of forms" is to obtain more effective means for the development of the mind and "unfolding consciousness." This barbarism is quite standard because the ordinary scientists decline to view everything that is "invisible" and can't be investigated "by purely physical means." Occultism allows one to obtain the "missing knowledge" and makes the concept of the evolution of forms not only more complete, but also explains the cause of the entire process, without which it seems completely meaningless.{{sfn|Taimni|1969|p=384}}

== Orientalists and Theosophists ==
In 1888, the president of the Theosophical Society Henry Olcott met in [[Oxford]] with [[Max Müller]], "the father of the '[[Science of religion]]'," as Lopez named his.{{sfn|Lopez|2009|pp=154, 158}} Olcott wrote later in his diary that professor Müller, in a conversation with him, highly appreciated the work of Theosophists in translating and re-publishing the sacred books of the East. "But as for our more cherished activities," Olcott wrote, "the discovery and spread of ancient views on the existence of [[Siddha]]s{{sfn|Eliade|1958|p=303}} and of the ''[[siddhi]]s'' in man,{{sfnm|Radhakrishnan|1948b|1pp=366–7|Трефилов|2005|2p=379}} he was utterly incredulous." In Müller's opinion, nor in the [[Vedas]], nor in the [[Upanishads]] there are any esoteric overtones announced by the Theosophists, and they only sacrifice their reputation, pandering "to the superstitious belief of the Hindus in such follies." In response to Olcott's attempt to argue his point of view by references to the [[Gupta-Vidya]]{{refn|group=note|"'''Gupta-vidya''' (Sanskrit) ''Gupta-vidyā'' [from ''gupta'' from the verbal root ''gup'' to conceal, preserve + ''vidyā'' knowledge, wisdom] Secret knowledge, secret wisdom; the source of all religions and philosophies known to the world: theosophy, the ancient wisdom-religion, the esoteric philosophy."{{sfn|Purucker|1999}}}} and [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Patanjali]] the professor said, "We had better change the subject." The president has remembered well not only this conversation, but also "two marble statuettes of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] sitting in [[meditation]], placed to the right and left of the fireplace." He noted this fact, having written in his diary in brackets: "[[Buddhist]]s take notice."{{sfnm|Olcott|1910|1p=61|Lopez|2009|2p=157}}

Professor Lopez claimed that this was a significant meeting, because both, Buddhist Olcott, and the [[Buddhist studies]] scholar Müller, although both were directly related to Buddhism, nevertheless took different positions and lived in different worlds. The world of Olcott, an American emigre and convinced Theosophist "no formal training in the classical languages of Buddhism", but who was knowing well both the Buddhist world, and many reputable monks, collided with the world of Müller, a German emigre and outstanding [[sanskrit]]ologist, who was reading "Buddhist manuscripts in the original Sanskrit and [[Pali]]," and however failed to recognize theirs esoteric meaning and "never traveled beyond Europe." In Asia, Olcott faced with Buddhist superstition, which is why he argued with some of the leading monks of Sri Lanka. But he deeply revered the Buddhist mores. After his travels through the countries of Asia, he knew that for Buddhists it was absolutely unacceptable and offensive to place anything connected with [[dharma]] on the floor [or even on a chair]. Moreover, he knew that Buddhists "would never place a statue of the Buddha on the floor."{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=158}}{{refn|group=note|"As a representation of an exalted being, the image of the Buddha must also be exalted."{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=159}}}} {{See also|Buddhism and Theosophy#The Founders of the Theosophical Society}}

Olcott asked all the same of the origin of these statuettes and inquired about their placement. Müller answered that "the statues of the Buddha" standing on the floor near his fireplace were taken out of "the great temple of [[Rangoon]] (presumably the [[Shwedagon Pagoda|Shwedagon]])."{{refn|group=note|"It is unclear whether they were pillaged during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]", Lopez wrote, "when British troops captured and held the temple for two years, or during the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War|Second]], when British troops captured the temple in 1852; it then remained under the control of the military until 1929."{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=159}}}} The professor was so imbued with the British imperialism, as Lopez noted, that he was not at all embarrassed to use the military trophies captured in the Buddhist temple. The "more interesting" was Müller's answer to the question why he put the Buddha statues on the floor: "Because with the Greeks the hearth was the most sacred spot." According to Lopez, the answer "sounds slightly disingenuous, but its implication is important." For Müller, the image of the Buddha, captured in Asia and taken to England, has ceased to be Asian, and therefore its owner was not obliged allegedly to follow the "Asian custom." For him, the Buddha became part "of European culture, like a Greek god," and therefore he should follow the customs of Western civilization.{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=159}}

Five years after the meeting with Olcott, professor Müller published an article ''Esoteric Buddhism,'' in which he tried again, in a different form, to prove that there is no esotericism in Buddhism and never was. All his indignation the professor directed against Blavatsky, believing that the Buddhist esotericism is only her invention. "I love Buddha and admire Buddhist morality", Müller wrote, "that I cannot remain silent when I see his noble figure lowered to the level of religious charlatans, or his teaching misrepresented as esoteric twaddle."{{sfnm|Müller|1893|1p=784|Lopez|2009|2p=179}}{{refn|group=note|Also a prominent Buddhist studies scholar [[Thomas Rhys Davids|Rhys Davids]] believed that "the original Buddhism was the very contrary of esoteric."{{sfn|Davids|1896|p=210}}}} Theosophists often disagreed with the European [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] and ridiculed their limitation. In 1882, in his letter to [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Alfred Sinnett]] [[mahatma]] [[Kuthumi]] offered, "Since those gentlemen—the Orientalists—presume to give to the world their ''soi-disant'' translations and commentaries on our sacred books, let the theosophists show the great ignorance of those 'world' [[pandit|pundits]], by giving the public the right doctrines and explanations of what they would regard as an absurd, fancy theory."{{sfnm|Barker|1924|1p=185|Lopez|2009|2pp=184–185}}

== Occultists and sceptics ==
For Hindus, the [[Siddhi|supernatural powers]] of a [[yogi|person, who was specially trained]], aren't something special. Professor [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] noted that in Indian psychology "the psychic experiences, such as [[telepathy]] and [[clairvoyance]], were considered to be neither abnormal nor miraculous."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1948a|p=28}}

Kuhn wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, to consider [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] as a deception is to offend humanity: "To believe that for so many thousands of years, one-half of mankind practiced deception and fraud on the other half, is equivalent to saying that the human race was composed only of knaves and incurable idiots."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=18|Kuhn|1992|2p=132}} However, according to the Theosophical [[mahatma|Masters]], the "recent persecutions" for alleged [[witchcraft]], magic, [[mediumship]] convincingly show that the "only salvation" of the genuine occultists lies in the public skepticism, because the attribution to the "charlatans and the jugglers" securely protects them.{{sfn|Barker|1924|p=4}}

A member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] [[Eugene Alexandrov]] argued that the [[paranormal]] phenomena don't exist. He wrote, "There is no telepathy (a transmission and reading of thoughts), there is no clairvoyance, [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] is impossible, there is no '[[dowsing]]', there is no phenomena of a '[[poltergeist]]', there is no [[psychokinesis]]."{{sfn|Александров|2015|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|See also arguments of [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]]:{{sfn|Carroll|2003}}}} As Edi Bilimoria{{sfn|Theowiki}} wrote, a typical western scientist don't distinguish (or can't distinguish) two things: a "map" (the scientific model of the world) and "territory" (Nature).{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=71}}{{refn|group=note|Thus, if he didn't want to mark any "ravines" or "swamps" (the paranormal phenomena) on his "map," this don't mean that he will never "find himself" there. For participants in a hypothetical dialogue the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiated]] occultist and a typical scientist, Bilimoria chose the appropriate abbreviations: OWL (''Occultist,'' ''Wise,'' and ''Learned,'' or ''an owl'') and ASS (''Archetypal Sceptical Scientist,'' or ''an ass'').{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=99}}}} {{See also|Map–territory relation}}

=== "Occult or Exact Science?" ===
{{Fringe section|date=September 2018}}
A religious studies scholar Arnold Kalnitsky wrote that in this work Blavatsky outlines her "typical" views about science.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=155}}{{refn|group=note|This article was first published in 1886 in the Theosophical magazine ''[[The Theosophist]].'' Later it was included in the 7th volume of the ''Blavatsky Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Blavatsky|1956}}}}

;Statement on impotence of science
Kalnitsky wrote that at the beginning of her article, Blavatsky distinguishes "modern science" from "esoteric science", and argues that the methodology of the latter is preferable because it ultimately has a more practical, solid basis.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=155}}{{refn|group=note|A religious studies scholar [[Vladimir Trefilov]] stated, "Without denying the positive role of science, the Theosophical theorists emphasize its limitations."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}}}} He cited the passage from hers article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Every new discovery made by modern science vindicates the truths of the archaic philosophy. The true [[occult]]ist is acquainted with no single problem that esoteric science is unable to solve, if approached in the right direction."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=55|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=155}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He concluded Blavatsky considers modern science to be a form of the "archaic philosophy", which, as a synthesized worldview, includes the "esoteric science." According to her, this is the position of the "true occultist," who can solve any problem by the proper use of esoteric methodology.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=155}}{{refn|group=note|A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] stated, "Madame Blavatsky declared that occultism had no quarrel with so-called exact science where 'the conclusions of the latter are grounded on a substratum of unassailable fact'."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=258}}}}

Blavatsky criticizes, Kalnitsky noted, the perspective of modern science, by disagreeing with the idea that the manipulation of matter presents a real scientific challenge. She asserts that replacing the word "[[matter]]" with the term "[[spirit]]" would result in a greater goal. She tries to show that knowledge of mere matter is not enough to provide the answers sought by science, because such knowledge does not adequately explain even the simplest phenomena of nature. Blavatsky notes that [[Spiritualism|spiritualistic phenomena]], with which she claims her audience would be well familiar, show the need for revising the prevailing scientific consensus. She argues that there is another form of "proof" of the existence of [[Extrasensory perception|extrasensory abilities]], citing the example of the use of narcotics, which allegedly had facilitated the demonstration of such abilities.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=156}}{{refn|group=note|Radhakrishnan claimed that, according to Indian philosophy's teachings, "The perfections ([[siddhi]]s) are attained through birth, drugs (oadhi), spells ([[mantra]]s), austerity (tapas), or concentration ([[samadhi]])."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1948b|p=339}}}} Blavatsky's statement on "natural phenomena" is quoted in Kalnitsky thesis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"No doubt the powers of human fancy are great; no doubt delusion and hallucination may be generated for a shorter or a longer period in the healthiest human brain either naturally or artificially. But natural phenomena that are not included in that 'abnormal' class do exist; and they have at last taken forcible possession even of scientific minds."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=59|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=156}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Recognizing the potential errors inherent in relying upon imagination, and the unreliability of "delusion and hallucination," Blavatsky is still trying to gain the "stamp of legitimation" from reputable scientific judgement that could confirm that supersensory abilities "do exist." It was a constant aim of Theosophy, though implicit, and it was accompanied always by a distrust to the scientific approach. On the one hand, Blavatsky gives occasion for a reconciliation with the scientists, on the other—continues to denounce them.{{refn|group=note|Hammer claimed that Blavatsky often demonstrated how it is possible to combine the negative attitude to science with a positive.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=221}}}} In Kalnitsky's opinion, she demonstrates a desire to show that the scientific evidence of the extrasensory perception is quite possible:{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=156–7}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The phenomena of [[Hypnosis|hypnotism]], of [[telepathy|thought-transference]], of sense-provoking, merging as they do into one another and manifesting their occult existence in our phenomenal world, succeeded finally in arresting the attention of some eminent scientists."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=59|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=157}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Kalnitsky stated Blavatsky shows a dualistic approach in her interpretation of these phenomena, distinguishing between "their occult existence" and their manifestation "in our phenomenal world." Apparently, this means that there is [[Noumenon|noumenal]] "sphere of reality," which is the basis of the phenomenal world. Furthermore, the assertion that "some eminent scientists" had shown interest in various forms of ESP, obviously, indicates that most scientists are not interested in it, and that widely recognizing of their paranormal nature did not happen. In particular, she criticizes the findings of the doctor [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]] and some other scientists in France, England, Russia, Germany and Italy, who "have been investigating, experimenting and theorising for over fifteen years."{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=157}} This is quoted in work by Kalnitsky:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The sole explanation given to the public, to those who thirst to become acquainted with the real, the intimate nature of the [[Paranormal|phenomena]], with their productive cause and genesis—is that the sensitives who manifest them are all '''hysterical!''' They are psychopates, and neurosists—we are told—no other cause underlying the endless variety of manifestations than that of a purely physiological character."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=59|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=157}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Scientific method's limitation
Kalnitsky wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the scientists, who are trying to explore the controversial [[Paranormal|paranormal phenomena]], find themselves in a situation of utter helplessness, but it is not their fault. They simply do not have an appropriate set of conceptual "tools" for the right approach to these phenomena. Without an elementary familiarization with occult principles and the adoption, at least as a working hypothesis, the notion of the [[Plane (esotericism)|subtle worlds]] of nature, the science is not able to reveal the true depth and scope of the universal laws that underlie all cosmic processes. The orthodox [[Materialism|scientists-materialists]] are constrained by the limitations of their sciences, and so they need a new orientation based on the attraction of occult knowledge. However, according to Blavatsky, even admitting the legitimacy of the occult hypothesis, they will not be able to bring their research to the end:{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=158–9}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Therefore, having conducted their experiments to a certain boundary, they would desist and declare their task accomplished. Then the phenomena might be passed on to [[transcendental philosophy|transcendentalists]] and philosophers to speculate upon."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=71|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=159}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Turning to the consideration of conflicting opinions about the paranormal experience, Blavatsky says that the scientific recognition of the hypothesis about the nature of the [[Parapsychology|psychic]] phenomena is not excluded, but it requires a discussion in relation to their underlying causes. She also claims that to defend the Theosophical position harder than spiritualistic, because the Theosophists categorically reject as a materialist theory so and a belief in spirits, presented in a traditional spiritualistic approach. Blavatsky classifies the spiritualists as the "idealists" and the scientists—as the "materialists," who both fully convinced that modern science can, respectively, or to confirm, or to deny the authenticity of the kingdom of the spirits. But those who believe in the ability of a science to accept the occult presentation will be disappointed, because its modern methodology simply does not allow it.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=160}} Kalnitsky has quoted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Science, unless remodelled entirely, can have no hand in occult teachings. Whenever investigated on the plan of the modern scientific methods, occult phenomena will prove ten times more difficult to explain than those of the spiritualists pure and simple."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=77|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=160}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He wrote that Blavatsky believes that modern scientific methods need to be rethought and remodeled to make it possible to study phenomena that can not be adequately explained from the materialistic standpoint. She expresses her disappointment with the existing state of affairs, doubting in achieving any progress. After ten years of a careful monitoring of the debate, she does not believe in the possibility of an objective and impartial investigation of the paranormal phenomena, not to mention the real revision of the well-established scientific views and the adoption of more adequate occult theory. The few scientists who could believe in the authenticity of such phenomena do not accept the hypothesis beyond the spiritualistic representations. Even in the midst of doubt of the truth of the materialist worldview, they are unable to move from spiritualism to the occult theory. In the study of [[Paranormal|unexplained]] side of the nature their respect for the traditional scientific orthodoxy always prevails over their personal views. Thus, according to Blavatsky, a necessary condition of objectivity is the impartiality and a change of the opinions.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=160–1}}

In Kalnitsky's opinion, considering the methodology of science, Blavatsky understood that the [[inductive reasoning]], based on data supplied by the physical senses, can not adequately provide a reliable way to study the abnormal phenomena.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=162}} He has quoted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Science—I mean Western Science—has to proceed on strictly defined lines. She glories in her powers of observation, induction, analysis and inference. Whenever a phenomenon of an abnormal nature comes before her for investigation, she has to sift it to its very bottom, or let it go. And this she has to do, and she cannot, as we have shown, proceed on any other than the inductive methods based entirely on the evidence of physical senses."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1p=78|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=162}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Against ethical materialism
Kalnitsky wrote Blavatsky argues that the fruits of materialistic scientific worldview, reaching the sphere of practical interests of the people, shape their [[ethics]]. She sees a direct logical connection between a faith in the soulless mechanistic universe and by the fact that is for her as a purely egoistic attitude to life.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=162}} He has quoted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The theoretical materialistic science recognizes nought but [[Matter|'''substance''']]. Substance is its deity, its only God." We are told that practical materialism, on the other hand, concerns itself with nothing that does not lead directly or indirectly to personal benefit. "Gold is its idol," justly observes Professor [[Alexander Butlerov|Butleroff]] (a spiritualist, yet one who could never accept even the elementary truths of occultism, for he "cannot understand them"). – "A lump of matter," he adds, "the beloved substance of the theoretical materialists, is transformed into a lump of mud in the unclean hands of ethical materialism. And if the former gives but little importance to inner (psychic) states that are not perfectly demonstrated by their exterior states, the latter disregards entirely the inner states of life... The spiritual aspect of life has no meaning for practical materialism, everything being summed up for it in the external. The adoration of this external finds its principal and basic justification in the dogma of materialism, which has legalized it."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1956|1pp=79–80|Kalnitsky|2003|2pp=162–3}}{{refn|group=note|In 1871, Butlerov organized, "to the consternation of many of his fellow scientists," the first scientific commission for the investigation of the [[Mediumship|mediumistic]] phenomena.{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=171}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Kalnitsky wrote Blavatsky clearly expresses her utter contempt for the values of "practical materialists." She accuses the ideological foundations of theoretical materialism for its an ignoring of the spiritual dimension of reality. This aversion to the complete unspirituality of the materialism reflects her "implicit [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] ethical stance." A materialistic-physical and selfish interests are not compatible with the idealised world of the spirit and the transcendental purpose of [[Mysticism|mystical]] enlightenment. The practical materialists, even professing adherence to a moral code, do not cease to be by ethical materialists. According to Kalnitsky, "Blavatsky's radical gnostic dualism is allowing no room for compromise or alternative options." Thus, she considers the esoteric vision of reality the only viable alternative.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=163–4}}

Kalnitsky wrote that science was seen in the West as the dominant category of knowledge and for the Theosophists it was not so an enemy, as a potential ally. However, the stereotypes of the materialistic thinking were one of the main obstacles to the esoteric representation of reality. Thus, at every opportunity Blavatsky tries to dispel what was for Theosophy, as she considered, alien and wrong. It is meant to challenge to many of the basic principles that supported the materialistic basis of science. However, a neutral and objective approach of the science to the analysis of the facts seemed, for the Theosophists, trustworthy. Blavatsky's striving to apply this approach to the consideration of the paranormal and mystical phenomena pursued a goal: to achieve the legitimacy and public acceptance of Theosophy. A skeptical position, which was taken by Blavatsky in respect of the materialistic science, was motivated by her outrage over the ignore by the scientists the spiritual dimension of reality. On the other hand, the assertion that spiritual truths can be proven from a scientific point of view, was a constant theme of Blavatsky's claims. The efforts of the Theosophists were focused on the legitimation of all forms of extrasensory and mystical experience.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=165}}

== Theosophical psychophysiology ==
{{Main article|Thought-Forms (book)}}
A few years after Blavatsky's death, the "second generation" of the Theosophists came to the leadership of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Wessinger|2013}} As Hammer wrote, during this period, the "foci" of the Theosophical scientism shifted from the theory of evolution to other areas of science.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=222}} [[Charles Leadbeater]], who became "the chief ideologist" of the Society, had involved with [[Annie Besant]] in the study of a functioning of the human mind. A religious studies scholar Gregory Tillett wrote that, according their claim, the functioning of mind "extrudes into the external world" the thought-forms which can be observed using clairvoyance methods.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} In 1901 Besant and Leadbeater published a book named ''[[Thought-Forms (book)|Thought-Forms: A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation]]'' contained a lot of color illustrations of forms, "created," according to its authors, by thoughts, emotions, and senses of men, as well by music. They argued that main source of the forms is the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura of man]], the outer part of the cloud-like substance of his "[[Subtle body|subtle bodies]]," interpenetrating each other, and extending beyond the confines of his physical body.{{sfnm|Hammer|2003|1p=55|Wessinger|2013|2p=36}}{{refn|group=note|In Hammer's opinion, "Leadbeater proposed a theory of the human aura" based on some Blavatsky's ideas.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=223}} Truly, according to Blavatsky, "Every person emits a magnetic exhalation or aura."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1877a}} Goodrick-Clarke noted that a Japanese scientist [[Hiroshi Motoyama]] has expanded Leadbeater's concepts "through [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] experimental work concerning the subtle network of [[chakra]]s and [[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]] as conductors of [[prana|energy]] in the [[Subtle body|subtle bodies]]."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=235}}}}

== Theosophical chemistry ==
{{Main article|Occult Chemistry}}
According to Hammer and other scholars, in parallel with the "[[psychophysiology|psychophysiological]]" researches, the Theosophists were busy an occult chemistry based on a "greatly modified" atomic theory. Leadbeater began "the occult investigation" of chemical elements as early as 1895, and Besant soon joined him. They argued that, using clairvoyance, can describe the intra-atomic structure of any element. In their words, each element composed of atoms containing a certain number of "smaller particles." They published "these and other results" in 1908 in a book ''[[Occult Chemistry|Occult Chemistry: Clairvoyant Observations on the Chemical Elements]].'' Hammer wrote, "Although Leadbeater was the principal clairvoyant, the enduring interest in... chemistry is probably due to Annie Besant's fascination with science, especially chemistry."{{sfnm|Hammer|2003|1pp=222–23|Wessinger|2013|2p=36|DeGracia|2006|3pp=131–148}}{{refn|group=note|[[René Guénon]] wrote that the "detailed description of different kinds of atoms" by Besant and Leadbeater can be termed as "pseudo-scientific fantasies."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=101}}}}

== Theosophy and physics ==
A historian of religion Egil Asprem informed that in 1923, an astronomer and Theosophist G. E. Sutcliffe published a book ''Studies in Occult Chemistry and Physics'' which was a "critical analysis" of the [[theory of relativity]]. The author has pursued the goal: to equalize the meaning of "Eastern" and "Western science," describing their "as two complementary 'schools'." In this book, the theory of relativity is regarded as the highest achievement of "Western science," whereas the results of the Theosophical study "of atoms and etheric structures" known as "occult chemistry" are presented as the achievement of "the 'Eastern' school".{{sfnm|Sutcliffe|1923|1pp=v–vi|Asprem|2013|2p=415}} In an effort to show that the results of occult research can be compared with the theory of relativity, Sutcliffe "proposes a wholly new theory of gravity," based on physics of [[Luminiferous aether|ether]]. From his reasoning it can be seen that he is thoroughly erudite in the Theosophical literature, while also having a background in "conventional physics from Britain" in the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. Sutcliffe tries to reinterpret the theory of [[Albert Einstein]] in "a tradition of British anti-relativism",  operating with the liberal "concept of ether."{{refn|group=note|"Ether physics was a crucial component of physics in Britain, and was part of the curriculum at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], as late as
1910."{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=416}}}} The concept of Sutcliffe is based on "contraction and expansion of the accompanying ether of bodies," so, according to him, gravitation "is one of the effects of an expanding sphere of ether," and the electrical phenomena are a function of the "contracting sphere."{{sfnm|Sutcliffe|1923|1p=xv|Asprem|2013|2p=416}}

Professor Taimni wrote that the theory of relativity apparently gave "a new direction to our civilization" and created problems that "are a challenge" to our current worldview and ways of thinking. In the "scientific circles" it is considered that if mathematics is used to prove something, then the question "is finally settled", and it can't be discussed. However, most such conclusions are not always based on proven assumptions, and this makes possible a mistake in "the final conclusion." Often one does not take into account the fact that mathematical inference can then be correct if he accepts into account "all factors" concerning this issue, and if it is not, the conclusion may be incorrect "or only partially correct." This should be borne in mind when considering the nature of space and time, as well as the Einstein's method used to solve this problem. He based his theory "only on facts of the physical world" and if there are other, more [[Plane (esotericism)|subtle worlds]] "besides the physical",{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=936}}{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=237}} and they exist in accordance with the occult, then his theory has no authority "with respect to those worlds." Since his theory is based only on physical facts, it can be true, at best, "only for purely physical phenomena." It can't be assumed that it reveals the nature of space and time "in general", because it is presented "to the human mind" functioning within the boundaries of "the physical brain." "The very fact that the concept of the [[Spacetime|time-space continuum]]" given in his theory is too difficult for the human mind, indicates its limitations. In fact, its author simply tried to interpret "imperfectly the shadows of some realities cast on the screen in a shadow play of the mind."{{sfn|Taimni|1969|pp=226–227, 334}}

Taimni wrote that anyone who closely studied the nature of space and time could be convinced that the human mind is "also a very important factor in this problem", therefore, to understand the space and time, it is necessary to take into account this factor. And since the human mind is not only what is manifested through its physical brain, but has "many degrees of subtlety and modes of expression," the entire human nature is "really involved in the problem" of space and time. And therefore only the one who "dived" into his consciousness and has "unraveled" his deepest secrets, having reached the source from which space and time come,{{refn|group=note|According to the occult science, space and time are the result of the manifestation of their archetypal principles, called "Mahakasha" and "[[Mahakala]]" respectively.{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=146}}}} is really capable of saying what the true nature "of these basic realities of the universe is." "Who is more competent to pronounce a correct opinion about the nature of an orange," Taimni is asking, "he who has merely scratched the rind or he who has peeled the orange and eaten it?"{{sfn|Taimni|1969|pp=334–335}}{{refn|group=note|In Taimni's opinion, Einstein's theory does not imply the existence "of super-physical worlds," ignores "the existence of mind and consciousness as principles independent of the physical world," suggests that there are "only three dimensions of space and one of time" and does not take into account "many other facts" of reality that are "part of the Occult Doctrine" and were repeatedly tested "by [[clairvoyance|seers]], occultists and [[mysticism|mystics]] of all ages."{{sfn|Taimni|1974|pp=6–7}}}}{{refn|group=note|Lopez claimed, "To understand the nature of reality, one must achieve [[buddhahood]]."{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=19}}}}

According to words of Kuhn, Blavatsky claimed, "It is on the doctrine of the illusive nature of matter, and the infinite divisibility of the atom, that the whole science of Occultism is built."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1p=520|Kuhn|1992|2p=261}} The researchers in esotericism Emily B. Sellon and Renée Weber have written: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Anticipating the conclusions of Einsteinian relativity and [[Field (physics)|field]] theory, as well as [[quantum mechanics]], Blavatsky proposed a universe in which billiard-ball atoms and push-pull forces were replaced by space, time, motion, and energy, yielding a picture of a dynamic universe far in advance of her time."{{sfn|Sellon, Weber|1992|p=326}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== New paradigm ==
According to a philosopher and religious studies scholar [[Vladimir Trefilov]], the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|modern Theosophists]] were among the first who attempted to create "a new paradigm of thinking through the synthesis of scientific and non-scientific knowledge."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}} As professor of Buddhist studies and Buddhist [[Evgeny Torchinov]] said, "Discussion between physicists, philosophers, psychologists, and scholars of religious studies in order to find the solutions of a problem of the [[Paradigm shift|general scientific paradigm change]], the isomorphism of consciousness and physical world,{{refn|group=note|According to Indian occultists, the manifested Universe is the product of interaction of two primary Principles: "'''[[Shiva]]''', or '''Consciousness''' and '''[[Shakti]]''', or '''Power'''."{{sfnm|Woodroffe|1973|1p=23|Bilimoria|1997|2p=133}}}} and even the [[ontology]] of consciousness in general could well take place, if don't resort to sticking labels like 'mysticism'."{{sfn|Торчинов|2007|loc=Заключение}} Professor [[Stanislav Grof]], psychologist, wrote that Western science has raised matter to a status of the prime cause of Universe, reducing life, consciousness, and mind to the forms of its accidental products. Dominance in Western science a [[Mechanistic Materialism|paradigm of Newton-Descartes]] became one of the causes of the emergence and development of the "planetary crisis."{{sfn|Grof|1998|loc=Ch. 6}}

An Ukrainian philosopher [[#Theosophists-scientists|Julia Shabanova]] has believed that "the post-materialist scientific paradigm and the worldview idealism" should become a conceptual basis of the future civilization.{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=197}} The Russian cyberneticist [[Sergei P. Kurdyumov|Sergei Kurdyumov]] and [[Doktor nauk|philosopher]] Helena Knyazeva, in a book ''Laws of Evolution and Self-organization of Complex Systems,'' suggested that the "paradigm of self-organization and non-linearity" would become the basis of the new scientific paradigm, taking from the West "the positive aspects of the tradition of analysis", and from the East—ideas of the [[Holism|integrity]], cyclicity, and the one law for Universe and man.{{sfn|Князева, Курдюмов|1994|pp=73, 223}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Eastern ideas about the universal coherence, the unity of everything in the world, and the cyclic flowing into each other of Non-Being and [[Being]] (unmanifested and manifested) can resonate with the [[Synergetics (Haken)|synergetic]] models... We can assume that there is a kind of an origin environment, in which all other observable and studied environments have grown. Then all the environments, with which we are dealing in life and scientific experiment, appear as some fluctuations (disturbances), the visible to us manifestations (modifications) of this one substrate—the origin environment."{{sfn|Князева, Курдюмов|1994|p=57}}{{refn|group=note|[[Fritjof Capra]] wrote in 1982, "The parallels to [[Eastern mysticism]] are appearing not only in physics but also in biology, psychology and other sciences...

According to a historian of religion Egil Asprem, an Indian scientist and engineer Edi Bilimoria{{sfn|Theowiki}} was one of the most significant characters "in the Theosophical discourse on science of the last decade and a half." In his work ''Mirages in Western Science Resolved by Occult Science'' he confirms the division into "Western" and "occult" science which took place already at the time of the formation of the Theosophical Society, and also "conceptually" updates the discussion of "modern physics and cosmology." Playing back the well-known Theosophical "rhetoric," Bilimoria suggests to move forward to "a reconciliation and reuniting of the wise old parent, Occult Science, with its adolescent prodigal son, Western science."{{sfnm|Bilimoria|1997|1p=v|Asprem|2013|2p=424}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Occult science is not bent on toppling, but rather on uplifting Western science to an even nobler position, by using examples from Western science itself to show how it is rooted in the deeper substratum of Occult Science and Philosophy."{{sfnm|Bilimoria|1997|1p=196|Asprem|2013|2p=425}}{{refn|group=note|Speaking of the ancient occult science, mahatma Kuthumi wrote, "Our laws are as immutable as those of Nature, and they were known to man and eternity before this strutting game cock, modern science, was hatched."{{sfn|Barker|1924|p=144}} Thus, according to Bilimoria, the fact of the "expanding Universe was well known" to occultists else in antiquity, "only in greater" detail in comparison with the concept of the "modern cosmologists."{{sfn|Bilimoria|1997|p=142}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism of Theosophy ==
{{See also|Theosophical mysticism#Criticism}}
A Russian philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] wrote that modern Theosophy is a doctrine not only "anti-religious" and "antiphilosophic", but also "anti-scientific."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1911|p=397}} A religious philosopher [[Sergius Bulgakov]] stated that [Blavatskian] Theosophy, trying to replace religion with itself, turns into a "vulgar pseudoscientific mythology."{{sfn|Bulgakov|2012|p=37}} In [[Nikolai Berdyaev|Berdyaev's]] opinion, modern Theosophy does not represent a synthesis of religion, philosophy and science, as its adherents say, but there is a "mixture" of them, in which there is no real religion, no real philosophy, no real science.{{sfn|Berdyaev|1972|p=299}}

The ambiguous attitude of the Theosophists towards science was especially abruptly criticized by the servants of the Christian church.{{refn|group=note|See also: [[Christianity and Theosophy#Confrontations]].}} In 1912, John Driscoll, an author of ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]],'' has described [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy's]] attitude to science as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Modern theosophy claims to be a definite science. Its teachings are the product of thought, and its source is consciousness, not any Divine revelation. &lt;...&gt; Judging it as presented by its own exponents, it appears to be a strange mixture of mysticism, charlatanism, and thaumaturgic pretension combined with an eager effort to express its teaching in words which reflect the atmosphere of Christian ethics and modern scientific truths."{{sfn|Driscoll|1912|pp=627–8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A Russian theologian, [[Andrey Kuraev]], accused the Theosophists of violation of the principles of scientific aethics, arguing they do not react to the opponents' objections, do not bring "a scientific arguments in support of their position", and also put themselves "beyond all criticism from side of science." In support of his words, Kurayev quoted Blavatsky's statement on the need to fight with "every modern scholar's" pretension to evaluate "of ancient Esotericism", when he is not "a Mystic" or "a Kabalist".{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1897|1p=13|Кураев|2000|2p=129}} In connection with the special attention of the Theosophists to the theory of evolution, a Russian Orthodox cleric and theologian Dimitry Drujinin wrote that "Theosophy began to parasitize on the central tendencies of thought and science of its time." And also: "The rough and cheeky Blavatsky's criticism of Darwinism turned into personal insults to scholars." According to Drujinin, "the statements of Theosophy are an absurd nonsense."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|pp=79–81}} Lydia Fesenkova, an employee of the [[Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of philosophy]], also severely criticized the occult statements of Blavatsky, which described anthropogenesis: "From the point of view of science, such beliefs are an explicit profanity and don't have the right to exist in the serious literature."{{sfn|Фесенкова|2004|p=93}}

An [[:ru:Действительные члены РАН|academician]] [[:ru:Вячеслав Стёпин|Viacheslav Stepin]] answering the question about [[pseudoscience]] said, "The dominant value of the scientific rationality begins to influence other spheres of culture—and religion, the myth are modernized often under this influence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5217">{{Kehuna and Kohanim}}
The '''twenty-four kohanic gifts''' are a description in the [[Gemara]] tradition of offerings given to the Jewish priests.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli: the Gemara: the classic Vilna edition Hersh Goldwurm - 2007 "A bechor is one of twenty-four "gifts" that the Torah awards to Kohanim (Rashi ; for a complete list of the twenty-four Kohanic gifts, see Gemara below, 110b)."&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective "kohanic" means "of a [[kohen]]", relating to a Jewish priest.

The [[Kohen|Kohanim]] were compensated for their service in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] - and to the nation - through twenty-four "priestly gifts".  The majority of these gifts were food items. Of these twenty-four gifts, ten gifts were given to the priests in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], the "Holy House" (''beyth ha-miqdash''), four were to be consumed by the priests in [[Jerusalem]], and ten were to be given to the priests even outside the [[land of Israel]]. 

The gifts are usually not given today, when there is no Temple in Jerusalem. For example, most practising Jews today do not give first-born of their animals to modern Kohanim. Other practices may be followed, such as selling the mother animal to a non-Jew before it gives birth to the firstborn, and then buy back both the animal and its firstborn.&lt;ref&gt;Zeʾev Grinvald ''Shaarei Halachah: A Summary of Laws for Jewish Living'' (2001), pPage 384 "Firstborn male animals are one of the twenty-four gifts which were given to Kohanim. Many halachos apply to firstborn animals (e.g. one may not slaughter them, eat their meat, etc.). Today, when there is no Temple, first-born animals are not given to Kohanim, but it is customary to sell the mother cow, sheep, or goat to a non-Jew before she gives birth to her firstborn, and then buy back the mother and the firstborn."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gifts==
According to [[Tosefta]] Hallah, the ten gifts given in (or to be consumed in) the Temple area were portions of:{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
:1. an animal brought as a [[sin offering]]
:2. [[guilt offering]]
:3. sacrifices of the communal [[Slaughter offering|peace offering]]
:4. a bird brought in as a sin offering
:5. the suspensive guilt offering&lt;ref&gt;Neusner ''The Comparative Hermeneutics of Rabbinic Judaism: Why this, not that?'' p115&lt;/ref&gt;
:6. the olive oil offering of a [[Leper|metzora]]&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Neusner ''Texts Without Boundaries: Sifra and Sifré to Numbers '' 2002 D. The [[sin offering]], guilt offering, sacrifices of peace offerings of the community, the hide of the burnt offering, the excess of the log of oil presented by the metzora, the excess of the sheaf of first barley, the two loaves and...&lt;/ref&gt;
:7. the two loaves of bread brought on [[Shavuot|Shavuot (first fruits)]]
:8. the [[showbread]]
:9. the left over portion of the [[meal offering]]
:10. the left over portion of grain from the offering of the [[Wave offering|first sheaf]], the [[Counting of the Omer|omer]] offering

Gifts given (or to be consumed) within the walls of Jerusalem were:
:11. firstborn of any domestic kosher animal
:12. [[First_Fruits#Hebrew_perspective|first fruits]]
:13. the inner organs of certain offerings, that which is removed from the [[Nazirite#Ending of the nazirite period|Nazirite offering]]
:14. the skins of certain offerings

Gifts which could be given (or consumed) outside Jerusalem were:
:15. [[Terumah|heave offering]] of a portion of the harvest
:16. [[Terumat hamaaser|heave offering of the tithe]] - a [[tithe]] of the Levite's tithe
:17. [[Challah|a portion of dough]]
:18. the first shearing of the sheep
:19. [[foreleg, cheeks and maw]] of all non-sanctified, ritually slaughtered domestic animals
:20. [[Pidyon haben|money given in exchange for redemption of a first-born son]] (Hebrew: ''pidyon haben'' פדיון הבן; redemption of the son) - in rabbinical practice five silver [[shekel]]s for the redemption of a firstborn [[Israelite]] son
:21. money (or a sheep or goat) redeemed in place of a firstborn donkey
:22. things declared [[Herem (priestly gift)|herem]], the hromim property or possession dedicated to the Temple without specifying to which use it is to be given
:23. inherited fields that were dedicated to the Temple and not reclaimed in the [[Jubilee (biblical)|Jubilee]] year
:24. that recovered which was stolen from a resident alien who has died, leaving no heirs

Females, who did not serve in the Tabernacle or the Temple, were permitted to consume and/or benefit from some of the twenty-four priestly gifts. But if a Kohen's daughter married a man from outside the Kohanic line, she was no longer permitted to benefit from the priestly gifts. Conversely, the daughter of a non-priest who married a priest took on the same rights as an unmarried daughter of a priest.

==Early life==
Z. Budapest was born in [[Budapest, Hungary]]. Her mother, Masika Szilagyi, was a medium, a practicing witch, and a professional sculptress whose work reflected themes of [[Goddess]] and [[nature]] spirituality. In 1956, when the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] broke out, she left Hungary as a political refugee. She finished high school in [[Innsbruck]], graduated from a bilingual gymnasium, and won a scholarship to the [[University of Vienna]] where she studied languages.&lt;ref name="Lesbian Pride Website" /&gt;

Budapest immigrated to the United States in 1959, where she studied at the [[University of Chicago]], with groundbreaking originator of the art of improvisation, Viola Spolin, and the improvisational theater group [[The Second City]].&lt;ref name="Lesbian Pride Website" /&gt; She married and had two sons, Laszlo and Gabor, but later divorced.

==Career==
[[File:Three-Crescents-Diane-Poitiers-multicolored.png|thumb]]
She moved to Los Angeles from New York City in 1970, and became an activist in the [[women's liberation movement]]. She was on the staff of the first Women's Center in the U.S. there for many years,&lt;ref&gt;''Women's Periodicals in the United States: Social and Political Issues'' by Kathleen L. Endres and Therese L. Lueck. Greenwood Publishing Group (Jan 1, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and became the Founder and High Priestess of [[Susan B. Anthony]] Coven #1, the first feminist, women-only, witches' coven, which was founded in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://susanbanthonycoven.com/membership/ |title=Membership – Dianic Tradition – Susan B.

==Controversy==

===Witch-hunt===
In 1975, she was arrested for "fortune telling" at her candle and book store in [[Venice, California]] following a "sting" by an undercover police woman Rosalie Kimberlin, who received a tarot reading from her. Subsequently, Budapest was charged with violating a municipal by-law, Code 43.30, which meant fortune telling was unlawful. Budapest and her defense team described the event as "the first witch prosecuted since Salem,"&lt;ref name="Full Bloom 1999"&gt;''In Full Bloom: Tales of Women in Their Prime'' by Sharon Creeden. August House (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and the ensuing trial became a focus for media and pagan protesters. Budapest was found guilty.&lt;ref name="Full Bloom 1999"/&gt;

Duly, Budapest and her legal counsel set out to establish Wicca, and more specifically Dianic Wicca, as a bona fide religion. The state's Supreme Court reversed the guilty verdict as unconstitutional and in violation of the Freedom of Religion Act.&lt;ref name="The Visionary State 2006"&gt;''The Visionary State: A Journey Through California's Spiritual Landscape'' by Erik Davis. Chronicle Books (June 22, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her conviction, she engaged in nine years of appeals on the grounds that reading the Tarot was an example of women spiritually counseling women within the context of their religion. With [[pro bono]] legal representation she was acquitted, and the laws against "fortune telling" were struck from California law.&lt;ref name="The Visionary State 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlogTalkRadio Website"&gt;[http://www.blogtalkradio.com/League_of_Extraordinary_Paranormal_Women/blog/2008/03/07/Michelle-Belanger-and-Z-Budapest BlogTalkRadio Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831005946/http://www.blogtalkradio.com/League_of_Extraordinary_Paranormal_Women/blog/2008/03/07/Michelle-Belanger-and-Z-Budapest |date=August 31, 2009 }}.

==="We All Come From The Goddess"===
In 2012, Budapest requested via [[Facebook]] that the song she wrote, "We All Come From The Goddess" be performed as written and not be altered to include male gods. She initially stated that anyone changing her song was cursed, but clarified in comments section of this post that she was joking.&lt;ref name="Song Controversy"&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/zbudapest/posts/3332681429068 Facebook].

==Television==
Budapest claims that her first job in television was as a Color Girl for the CBS Network in New York; that she was assigned to ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', and that it was her face that CBS adjusted their camera's settings to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zbudapest.com/] Z Budapest website {{cite web |url=http://zbudapest.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916084520/http://zbudapest.com/ |archivedate=September 16, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighties, she created the TV show ''13th Heaven'', which ran on syndicated cable in the San Francisco Bay area for seven years.&lt;ref name="Women's Studies 1995"/&gt;
