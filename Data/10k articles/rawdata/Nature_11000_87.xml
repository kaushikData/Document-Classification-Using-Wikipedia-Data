{{classic element}}
'''Air'''   is one of the four [[classical element]]s in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and in Western [[alchemy]].

==Greek and Roman tradition==
According to [[Plato]], it is associated with the [[octahedron]]; air is considered to be both hot and wet. The ancient Greeks used two words for air: ''aer'' meant the dim lower atmosphere, and ''[[aether (mythology)|aether]]'' meant the bright upper atmosphere above the clouds.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''A History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, pp. 466, 470–71.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]], for instance writes that "So it is with air: there is the brightest variety which we call ''aether'', the muddiest which we call mist and darkness, and other kinds for which we have no name...."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'', ch. 27, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the early Greek [[Pre-Socratic]] philosophers, [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] (mid-6th century BCE) named air as the ''[[arche]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, ''History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, pp. 115–16, 120–32; Jonathan Barnes, ''Early Greek Philosophy'', pp. 77–80.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar belief was attributed by some ancient sources to [[Diogenes Apolloniates]] (late 5th century BCE), who also linked air with intelligence and soul (''psyche''), but other sources claim that his ''arche'' was a substance between air and fire.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, vol. 2, pp. 362–81; Barnes, pp. 289–94.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristophanes]] parodied such teachings in his play ''[[The Clouds]]'' by putting a prayer to air in the mouth of [[Socrates]].

Air was one of many ''archai'' proposed by the Pre-socratics, most of whom tried to reduce all things to a single substance. However, [[Empedocles]] of Acragas (c. 495-c. 435 BCE) selected four ''archai'' for his four roots: Air, [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[water (classical element)|water]], and [[earth (classical element)|earth]]. Ancient and modern opinions differ as to whether he identified air by the divine name [[Hera]], [[Hades|Aidoneus]] or even [[Zeus]]. Empedocles’ roots became the four classical elements of Greek philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, vol. 2, pp. 138–46. Guthrie suggests that Hera is the safest identification for air.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] (427–347 BCE) took over the four elements of Empedocles. In the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', his major cosmological dialogue, the [[Platonic solid]] associated with air is the [[octahedron]] which is formed from eight equilateral triangles. This places air between fire and water which Plato regarded as appropriate because it is intermediate in its mobility, sharpness, and ability to penetrate.  He also said of air that its minuscule components are so smooth that one can barely feel them.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'', chap. 22–23; Gregory Vlastos, ''Plato’s Universe'', pp. 66–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's student [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) developed a different explanation for the elements based on pairs of qualities. The four elements were arranged concentrically around the center of the universe to form the [[sublunary sphere]]. According to Aristotle, air is both hot and wet and occupies a place between fire and water among the elemental spheres. Aristotle definitively separated air from [[aether (classical element)|aether]]. For him, aether was an unchanging, almost divine substance that was found only in the heavens, where it formed [[celestial spheres]].&lt;ref&gt;[[G. E. R. Lloyd]], ''Aristotle'', chapters 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Medicine in ancient Greece|ancient Greek medicine]], each of the [[four humours]] became associated with an element. [[Blood]] was the humor identified with air, since both were hot and wet. Other things associated with air and blood in ancient and medieval medicine included the season of [[spring (season)|spring]], since it increased the qualities of heat and moisture; the sanguine temperament (of a person dominated by the blood humour); [[hermaphrodite]] (combining the masculine quality of heat with the feminine quality of moisture); and the northern point of the compass.&lt;ref&gt;Londa Schiebinger, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[alchemical symbol]] for air is an upward-pointing triangle, bisected by a horizontal line.

==Modern reception==
The [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], founded in 1888, incorporates air and the other Greek classical elements into its teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Regardie, ''The Golden Dawn'', pp. 154–65.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[magical weapon|elemental weapon]] of air is the dagger which must be painted yellow with magical names and sigils written upon it in violet.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p.322; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 149–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings. The archangel of air is [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], the angel is Chassan, the ruler is Aral, the king is Paralda, and the air [[elemental]]s (following [[Paracelsus]]) are called [[sylph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Air is considerable and it is referred to the upper left point of the pentagram in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', pp. 280–286; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 206–209.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these associations have since spread throughout the occult community.

In the Golden Dawn and many other magical systems, each element is associated with one of the [[cardinal point]]s and is placed under the care of guardian Watchtowers. The Watchtowers derive from the [[Enochian magic|Enochian system of magic]] founded by Dee. In the Golden Dawn, they are represented by the Enochian elemental tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Doreen Valiente, ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Air is associated with the east, which is guarded by the First Watchtower.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Air is one of the five elements that appear in most [[Wicca]]n and Pagan traditions. [[Wicca]] in particular was influenced by the Golden Dawn system of magic and [[Aleister Crowley]]'s mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, pp. 216–23; Valiente, Witchcraft for Tomorrow, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallels in non-Western traditions==
In [[Hinduism]], ''[[Vayu]]'' ([[Sanskrit]] वायु  ), also known as ''Vāta'' वात, ''Pavana'' पवन (meaning the Purifier),&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning By Eva Rudy Jansen p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Prāna,'' is a primary deity, who is the father of [[Bhima]] and the spiritual father of Lord [[Hanuman]]. As the words for air (Vāyu) or wind (Pavana) it is one of the ''[[Classical elements#Classical elements in Hinduism|Panchamahābhuta]]'' the "five great elements" in Hinduism. 

Air is not one of the traditional five [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Chinese classical elements]].  Nevertheless, the ancient Chinese concept of ''[[Qi]]'' or ''chi'' is believed to be close to that of air. ''Qi'' is believed to be part of every living thing that exists, as a kind of "[[Vitalism|life force]]" or "[[energy (spirituality)|spiritual energy]]". It is frequently translated as "energy flow", or literally as "air" or "breath". (For example, ''tiānqì'', literally "sky breath", is the Chinese word for "[[weather]]"). The concept of qi is often [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]], however no scientific evidence supports its existence.

The element air also appears as a concept in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosophy which has an ancient history in China.

Some Western modern occultists equate the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Chinese classical element]] of [[metal (classical element)|metal]] with ''air'',&lt;ref&gt;Donald Michael Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; others with [[Wood (Wu Xing)|wood]] due to the elemental association of wind and wood in the [[bagua]].

[[Enlil]] was the god of air in ancient [[Sumer]]. [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] was the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] of air and the husband of [[Tefnut]], goddess of moisture. He became an emblem of strength by virtue of his role in separating [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] from [[Geb]]. Shu played a primary role in the [[Coffin Texts]], which were [[spell (paranormal)|spells]] intended to help the deceased reach the realm of the afterlife safely. On the way to the sky, the spirit had to travel through the air as one spell indicates: "I have gone up in Shu, I have climbed on the sunbeams."&lt;ref&gt;Bob Brier, ''Ancient Egyptian Magic'', p.128.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42484">'''Baptismal regeneration''' is the name given to doctrines held by major [[Christian denomination]]s which maintain that [[Christian salvation|salvation]] is intimately linked to the act of [[baptism]], and that salvation is impossible apart from it. [[Etymology|Etymologically]], the term means "being born again" (regeneration, or rebirth) "through [[baptism]]" (baptismal). Etymology concerns the origins and root meanings of words, but these "continually change their meaning, … sometimes moving out of any recognisable contact with their origin … It is nowadays generally agreed that current usage determines meaning."&lt;ref&gt;[[G. B. Caird|Caird, G.B.]] "The Language and Imagery of the Bible". London: Duckworth (1980), p.44&lt;/ref&gt; While for Reformed theologian [[Louis Berkhof]], "regeneration" and "new birth" are synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Berkhof|Berkhof, L.]] ''Systematic Theology'', London: Banner of Truth Trust (1963), p.465&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Lockyer treats the two terms as different in meaning in one publication,&lt;ref&gt;Lockyer, Herbert. ''Encyclopedia de Doctrinas Bíblicas'', Miami: Logoi(1979) p.260.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} but in another states that baptism signifies regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;"Baptism is a figure of our union with the Lord by the work of the Spirit. The Supper is a figure of our communion with the same Lord through the work of His cross. The former signifies ''regeneration''; the latter, ''redemption''" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=BywUZArOxMkC&amp;pg=PA258 Herbert Lockyer, ''All the Doctrines of the Bible''] (Zondervan 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-31028051-4}}), p. 258).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is associated with {{bibleref|John|3:1-21|ESV}}, where Jesus tells Nicodemus, a Pharisee and member of the [[Sanhedrin|Jewish ruling council]], that "unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God ... unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|3:3-8|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest of the [[Church Fathers]] to enunciate clearly and unambiguously the doctrine of baptismal regeneration ("the idea that salvation happens at and by water baptism duly administered") was [[Cyprian]] (c. 200 – 258): "While he attributed all the saving energy to the grace of God, he considered the 'laver of saving water' the instrument of God that makes a person 'born again,' receiving a new life and putting off what he had previously been. The 'water of new birth' animated him to new life by the Spirit of holiness working through it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3QHRJNkbKJgC&amp;pg=PA118 Robert E. Olson, ''The Story of Christian Theology''] (InterVarsity Press 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-83081505-0}}), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of this doctrine include the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]], [[Lutheran]], and [[Anglican]] (especially its High-Church and Anglo-Catholic parties) churches.  In addition, churches originating out of the American [[Restoration Movement]], mainly the [[Churches of Christ]], are also commonly believed to hold to this doctrine, though they dispute this to be the case.

==Major denominations==

===Roman Catholicism===
{{see also|Sacraments of the Catholic Church}}
Section 1215 of the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3H.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] states: "This sacrament [baptism] is also called 'the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit,' for it signifies and actually brings about the birth of water and the Spirit without which no one 'can enter the kingdom of God.' (Titus 3:5)" Quoting the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19651207_ad-gentes_en.html Decree on the Church's Missionary Activity:14(para 1)], Christopher J. Walsh comments that the Second Vatican Council reaffirms the traditional understanding of Christian initiation as a unity and a process.  "It is not something achieved with a trickle of water one Sunday afternoon, but a progressive entry into a commitment and a relationship ... Becoming a Christian is a conversion a growing adherence to Christ in faith and sacrament over an extended period of time." (See also [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3J.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church], 1229–31)

Against this background the more detailed doctrine of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] can be summed up in the following statements from that catechism:
# While in {{bibleverse||John|3:5}} Jesus himself affirms that baptism is necessary for salvation, and no one should refuse to be baptized,&lt;ref&gt;"If anyone says that baptism is optional, that is, not necessary for salvation ({{bibleverse||John|3:5}}), let him be anathema" ([http://www.ewtn.com/library/councils/trent7.htm#3 Council of Trent, canon 5 on baptism).]&lt;/ref&gt; the effects of sacramental baptism are brought about also by "[[baptism of blood]]" (dying for the sake of the faith) and "[[baptism of desire]]", whether explicit, as in the case of catechumens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church], 1259&lt;/ref&gt; or implicit, as in the case of anyone who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it,
# As regards children who die without baptism, the Church entrusts them to the mercy of God.
# In Roman Catholic teaching, baptism, like all the sacraments, presupposes faith and by words and objects also nourishes, strengthens, and expresses it.
# Baptism is the sacrament of faith (cf. Mark 16:16). But faith needs the community of believers. It is only within the faith of the Church that each of the faithful can believe. The faith required for Baptism is not a perfect and mature faith, but a beginning that is called to develop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church], 1257-60,1261,1123,1153&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint [[Cyprian]] of Carthage explained the salvation promised by [[Jesus]] to one of the thieves crucified with him ("Today, you shall be with me in paradise", {{bibleverse||Luke|23:43}}) but who is not reported to have been baptized with water, by saying he was baptized in his own blood as a martyr, an opinion shared by Saint [[Jerome]], while Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] said that "the thief received the baptism of substitution ... through the faith and conversion of the heart, taking into account that circumstances made it impossible for him to celebrate the sacrament".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=US3SxAn-MNgC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41 André Daigneault, ''The Good Thief''] 2005 {{ISBN|1-59781-358-3}}, pp. 41, 49, 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine's explanation corresponds to the Roman Catholic Church teaching of the existence of ''baptism by desire'' for those who would partake of the Sacrament if they could and experience a perfect desire to do all that pertains to salvation, but are prevented from receiving baptism by circumstances beyond their control, while Cyprian's corresponds to the same Church's teaching on ''baptism of blood'' for martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia 1913, Baptism, http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
{{main article|Eastern Orthodoxy#The Holy Mysteries (Sacraments)}}
The following claims are made on websites associated with Orthodox Churches:
# Orthodoxy (and it is only fair to add, also the Roman Catholics and Anglo-Catholics) has always held to baptismal regeneration. In other words, that spiritual life begins with baptism.[http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/mission/makarios_zimbabwe_culture.htm]
#The Bible's "sacramental theology" states that there is [a need for the taint of sin to be removed] since "...through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men." (Romans 5:12) For this reason, "...there are none righteous, not even one" (i.e. not infants). (Romans 3:10) How are these young ones saved from the sin they have received from Adam's race? They are saved through the regenerative power of baptism and the faith of the Church (i.e. the Christian faithful) &lt;small&gt;[here Titus 3:5; Acts 2:38; John 3:5 &amp; 1 Peter 3:20, 21 are quoted]&lt;/small&gt; Baptism is not just a symbolic testimony of what God has done in the heart of an adult believer, but is in itself a dynamic means of actually effecting the power of the Gospel (the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ) in a life (Romans 6:4). Christian baptism is the means whereby we encounter and identify with Jesus Christ Himself [http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7067|The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]&lt;!-- Christian Baptism is the mystery of starting anew, of dying to an old way of life and being born again into a new way of life, in Christ. In the Orthodox Church, baptism is "for the remission of sins" (cf. the Nicene Creed) and for entrance into the Church; the person being baptized is cleansed of all sins and is united to Christ; through the waters of baptism he or she is mysteriously crucified and buried with Christ, and is raised with him to newness of life, having "put on" Christ (that is, having been clothed in Christ). The cleansing of sins includes the washing away of the ancestral sin. http://orthodoxwiki.org/Baptism --&gt;

===Oriental Orthodoxy===
If infants can receive the blessings of laying of hands by the Lord, they can also receive baptismal grace of regeneration. The theology behind this is that grace precedes faith (Eph. 2: 8) and prevenial grace is a reality. The initiative is from God always. If God takes the first step in dying for us, He also takes the first step in saving through the free gift of regeneration without the precondition of faith. [http://malankara.com/church/faithfaq.html The Syrian Orthodox Church in North America]

===Lutheranism===
{{main article|Lutheran sacraments}}

''The Doctrine of Baptism''. St. Louis: Concordia, 1972. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Luther's Small Catechism also states that baptism "works forgiveness of sins, delivers from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare."&lt;ref&gt;http://bookofconcord.org/smallcatechism.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther, in his Large Catechism (XIII), also wrote the following: "Moreover, that it is most solemnly and strictly commanded that we must be baptized or we cannot be saved".&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Concord Online, Luther's Large Catechism, Part 4 - Baptism, Paragraph 6. http://bookofconcord.org/lc-6-baptism.php#para6&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Lutheran writer, "[i]t is in the context of writing against people who believed that 'Baptism is an external thing, and that external things are no benefit'...Luther's point was that since the Lord instituted baptism (Matthew 28:19) and spoke of its importance (Mark 16:16), then we are to do as he says and baptize, knowing that the Holy Spirit works through baptism to change people's hearts. So, baptism is necessary in the sense that the Lord commands us to administer baptism:  it is not for us to decide whether or not we are going to do what the Lord says." &lt;ref name=WELS-NB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wels.net/what-we-believe/questions-answers/baptism/necessity-baptism |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=Necessity of Baptism |first= James |last= Pope |date= 9 Oct 2014|publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1552 an invitation to the congregation was inserted into the Anglican baptism rite to give thanks to God that the newly baptized are "regenerate and grafted into the body of Christ's congregation".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Holeton| first=David R.| title=Church, Sacraments and Ministry: 4 Initiation| encyclopedia=The Study of Anglicanism| editor-first=Sykes| editor-last=Stephen| editor2-last= Booty| editor2-first=John| location=London| publisher=SPCK| year=1988| page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were at least three periods in the history of English Anglicanism when the doctrine caused heated debate.  In the seventeenth century, some [[puritans]] objected strongly (it was mentioned specifically at the [[Savoy Conference]] in 1660);&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last1=Procter| last2=Frere| title=A New History of the Book of Common Prayer| location=London |publisher=MacMillan and Co| year=1902| page=181f}}&lt;/ref&gt; the subject come to the fore again in 1810&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Oxford Movement in Context | publisher=CUP | author=Nockles, Peter B. | year=1994 | location=Cambridge| page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the rise of the [[Tractarian Movement]] it was again hotly debated and gave rise to the celebrated [[Gorham Case]].&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, Owen. ''The Victorian Church''(vol 1) London: Adam &amp; Charles Black, 1966. p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

====Differing Anglican attitudes====
&lt;small&gt;[Page references in this section are to Nockles unless otherwise stated.]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In his summary of the situation from 1810 onwards, Nockles detects at least seven different strands of thought on the subject:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Oxford Movement in Context | publisher=CUP | author=Nockles, Peter B. | year=1997 | location=Cambridge| page=229ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Extreme Highchurch view: This insisted that the spiritual effects of baptism were inseparable from it even to the point of an ''opus operatum'' or purely mechanical understanding of the rite and this was the only acceptable doctrine of the Church of England.(pp.&amp;nbsp;230,232,233)
# The moderate HighChurch: While holding a high view of Baptismal Regeneration themselves, they recognised diversity of opinion must arise but held that the Liturgy provided a corrective.(p.&amp;nbsp;235)
# Calvinist Evangelicals: These accepted a rigorous doctrine of predestination, and with it that of antecedent grace, and therefore denied baptismal regeneration outright as unscriptural.(p.&amp;nbsp;229)
# The majority of Evangelicals: For them baptism was little more than initiation into the visible Church.(p.&amp;nbsp;229)
# Some of the former: The "little more" included the recognition of baptism at least as a sign of regeneration as stated by Article 27 of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]](p.&amp;nbsp;229)
# The moderate Evangelicals:  These, and J.B. Sumner (Archb of Canterbury 1848-62) was one, accepted what was, from the Highchurch perspective, a modified version of the doctrine in which the spiritual effects are not inseparably tied to the rite.  While holding this position, Sumner was not prepared to label Gorham's Calvinistic arguments heretical and insisted that Elizabethan divines (theologians) had allowed that the grace of spiritual regeneration could be separated from the sacrament of Baptism.(p.&amp;nbsp;230)
# A Protestant position: Formulated in the first instance by James Mozley as he moved away from Tractarianism and investigated the opinions of early generations of highchurch theologians on baptismal regeneration as Sumner had done.  He discovered "statements made sometimes, which, if put into easy English and placed before our [Highchurch] friends, would be set down as heresy, but which occur in undoubtedly orthodox authorities"(quoted Nockles, p.&amp;nbsp;234)

====The fundamental theological issue====
Griffith Thomas summed it up as follows: "[[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles]] XXV, XXVI, XXVII&lt;ref&gt;http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx#XXVI%7C&lt;/ref&gt; are all clearly against the ''opus operatum''[i.e. the invariable spiritual regeneration of every baptized infant (ed)] and yet the Baptismal Service has, "Seeing now that this child is regenerate"; and the Catechism also speaks of, "My Baptism wherein I was made a member of Christ," etc.  How are these to be reconciled? The question largely turns on the interpretation of the word "Regeneration," and differences of opinion are largely due to its ambiguity".&lt;!--
Dyson Hague comments on the affirmation "This Child is regenerate" as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;...volumes have been written upon this subject... ...We must be aware of the dangers of misinterpretation or partial exposition.  The words have often been taken by themselves as if they taught... ... the Roman doctrine of the invariable spiritual regeneration of every baptized infant, which they certainly do not.¶ All the troubles in regard to our Baptismal Service have come from disintegration or misinterpretation.  The teaching of the Church on Baptism must never be taken in segments, nor are fragmentary elements of the service to be excised or protruded.  Articles, Catechism and Baptismal Services form one perfect whole, and it is only insofar as all and each of them are weighed, compared and mutually interpreted that the doctrinal integrity and beauty of the Church's teaching can be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Hague| first=Dyson| title=Through the Prayer Book| location=London| publisher=Church Book Room Press| year=1948| page=294f}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; --&gt;
The Highchurchmen took their stand on the fact that "the liturgy declared the infant to be regenerate";&lt;ref name="chad250"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Victorian Church (vol I) | publisher=Adam &amp; Charles Black | author=Chadwick, Owen | year=1966 | location=London | pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Evangelical knew this "and wrote books to prove that he might use the service with a good conscience, interpreting the liturgy in a charitable sense"&lt;ref name="chad250" /&gt;  Bishop Moule spoke for this second group when he wrote:"In the sense of title and position, he [the newly baptized] is at once regenerate.  He receives the right and pledge and entitlement to covenant blessing.  But the infant who in sacramental title is regenerate needs in heart and spirit to be inwardly and really born again."  The bishop then widens the scope of his argument appealing to sacramental theology in general by quoting Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer|Cranmer]], Archbishop [[Ussher]] and [[Richard Hooker]] who in different ways state that the outward application a sacrament does not necessarily communicate the grace of the thing signified.&lt;ref&gt;quoted by {{citation| last=Hague| first=Dyson| title=Through the Prayer Book| location=London| publisher=Church Book Room Press| year=1948| page=296f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, Anglo-Catholic theologian [[E.L. Mascall]] has expressed the view that, "[T]he entry upon the supernatural realm which is bestowed by incorporation into Christ and which is fittingly described as a new birth is also a deliverance from the realm of fallen human nature -- the sphere in which man lies under the curse of original sin -- and an insertion into the realm of the perfect manhood of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Mascall, E.L. ''Christ, the Christian and the Church''. London: Longmans, 1946. p.84.&lt;/ref&gt; Mascall explains that, "The grace of incorporation into Christ, the normal channel of which is baptism, is a supernatural fact in the ontological order which does not of itself immediately produce physical and moral effects; but it does produce such effects mediately and progressively when, and to the degree in which, the soul co-operates with this grace and surrenders itself to its influence.&lt;ref&gt;Mascall, E.L. ''Christ, the Christian and the Church''. London: Longmans. 1946. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the Holy Spirit in Baptism has been emphasized by a several theologians. [[Richard A. Norris]] has said, "Forgiveness of sins and incorporation into Christ... are only made possible for people by the action of the Holy Spirit. It is the Spirit who... is God working within people to connect them with Christ and thus to set them in their proper relation with the Father. Baptism, consequently, has always been understood as a sacrament which signifies the gift of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Richard A. ''Understanding the Faith of the Church'' (The Church's Teaching Series). New York: The Seabury Press, 1979. p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey W. Bromiley]], an evangelical Anglican theologian, has written, "Baptism as identification with Christ is the sacrament of the regenerative work of the Holy Spirit, not of my consciousness and confession of faith. It is the sign of faith only as this is itself the work of the primary and sovereign divine operation."&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey W. ''Children of Promise: The Case for Baptizing Infants''. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1979. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; And Anglican theologian and bishop [[Hugh Montefiore]] says, "Baptism is efficacious if it is asked for in faith, in the sense that it enacts sacramentally what has been begun spiritually, and the very fact that it is an outward and visible sign both strengthens the faith of the baptized and is a public witness to that faith."&lt;ref&gt;Montefiore, Hugh. ''Credible Christianity: The Gospel in Contemporary Society''. London: Mowbray, 1993; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1994. p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodism===
The [[Methodist]] understanding of Holy Baptism is a "Wesleyan blend of sacramental and evangelical aspects."&lt;ref name=BWATS&gt;{{cite web|title=By Water and the Spirit: A United Methodist Understanding of Baptism|year=2008|work=The Book of Resolutions of The United Methodist Church|publisher=The United Methodist Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wesley]], the founder of the Methodist Church, taught that:
{{quote|In baptism a child was cleansed of the guilt of original sin, initiated into the covenant with God, admitted into the church, made an heir of the divine kingdom, and spiritually born anew. He said that while baptism was neither essential to nor sufficient for salvation, it was the "ordinary means" that God designated for applying the benefits of the work of Christ in human lives. On the other hand, although he affirmed the regenerating grace of infant baptism, he also insisted upon the necessity of adult conversion for those who have fallen from grace. A person who matures into moral accountability must respond to God's grace in repentance and faith. Without personal decision and commitment to Christ, the baptismal gift is rendered ineffective. Baptism for Wesley, therefore, was a part of the lifelong process of salvation. He saw spiritual rebirth as a twofold experience in the normal process of Christian development—to be received through baptism in infancy and through commitment to Christ later in life. Salvation included both God's initiating activity of grace and a willing human response.&lt;ref name=BWATS&gt;{{cite web|title=By Water and the Spirit: A United Methodist Understanding of Baptism|year=2008|work=The Book of Resolutions of The United Methodist Church|publisher=The United Methodist Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]]'' in Article XVII — Of Baptism, therefore states that "Baptism is not only a sign of profession and mark of difference whereby Christians are distinguished from others that are not baptized; but it is also a sign of regeneration or the new birth. The Baptism of young children is to be retained in the Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/the-articles-of-religion-of-the-methodist-church|title=The Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church|work=The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church|publisher=1784|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformed tradition===
{{see also|Calvinism}}
The [[Reformed confessions]] consistently teach a conjunction between baptism and regeneration. The confessions teach that baptism is an external sign of an inward reality (regeneration and cleansing from sin), and that baptism actually confers the inward reality which it signifies. The power of baptism, however, resides in the Holy Spirit rather than the act of baptism itself. Further, the application of the grace conferred in baptism is not tied to the time at which it is administered. The promise offered in baptism is conditional on faith and repentance, which may occur at a time later than the act of baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Letham |first=Robert |title=The Westminster Assembly: Reading Its Theology in Historical Context |series=The Westminster Assembly and the Reformed Faith |year=2009 |publisher=P&amp;R Publishing |location=Phillipsburg, NJ |isbn=978-0-87552-612-6 |pages=338&amp;ndash;339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Congregationalist New Testament scholar and theologian H. T. Andrews, after an examination of five texts (1 Cor. 6:11, 1 Cor. 15:29, Eph. 4:5 and 5:26, Titus 3:5), concluded: "In the light of these statements it is difficult to believe that the more neutral phrases, e.g. 'baptized into Christ,' 'baptized into one body,' imply a merely symbolical interpretation of baptism. With this evidence before us it seems very hard to resist the conclusion (however little we may like it) that if the Epistles do not enunciate the ecclesiastical doctrine of baptismal regeneration, they at any rate approximate very closely to it."&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, H. T. "Sacraments in the New Testament," in P. T. Forsyth, ed. ''Lectures on the Church and Sacraments''. London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1917. pp. 145-150.&lt;/ref&gt; The twentieth-century Scottish theologian [[D. M. Baillie]] has remarked that "[I]n New Testament thought baptism was closely connected with the death and resurrection of Christ. It stood for the great spiritual event in which a man, united by faith with the death and resurrection of Christ, dies to himself and the world and rises to newness of life, puts off the old man with his deeds and puts on the new man."&lt;ref&gt;Baillie, D. M. ''The Theology of the Sacraments''. New York: Scribner's, 1957. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other groups said to teach baptismal regeneration==
Gregory A. Boyd says that Oneness Pentecostals teach what he calls baptismal regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gospeloutreach.net/brchap.html Gregory A. Boyd, ''Oneness Pentecostals &amp; the Trinity'']&lt;/ref&gt; The publication ''Vantage Point'' attributes what it calls baptismal regeneration to "Roman Catholicism, Seventh-day Adventism, Mormonism, United Pentecostalism (and other Oneness churches), most [[Churches of Christ]] and Eastern Orthodoxy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfial.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=artGeneral.article_3 ''Vantage Point'', November 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter-Day Saint (Mormon)===
Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saint (Mormon) Church believe in baptismal regeneration. Baptism is understood as the means by which people enter the Body of Christ and receive a remission of their sins. Through baptism people enter a covenant by which they promise to come into the fold of God, to take upon themselves the name of Christ, to stand as a witness for God, to keep his commandments, and to bear one another's burdens, manifesting a determination to serve him to the end, and to prepare to receive the spirit of Christ for the remission of sins. The Lord, as his part of the covenant, is to pour out his spirit upon them, redeem them from their sins, raise them in the first resurrection, and give them eternal life. Baptism is understood to represent the death of the old person and their rebirth as an adopted spiritual child of Christ. Baptism is considered necessary for [[salvation]] and [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]]. Baptism must be conducted by an ordained Priesthood Holder with a line of authority that can be traced back to Christ.[http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Baptism] Latter-Day Saints trace this line of authority through Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery who are believed to have been ordained at the hands of the resurrected [[Apostle Peter]].[http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Melchizedek_Priesthood]

===Churches of Christ viewpoint===
Because of the belief that baptism is a necessary part of salvation, some hold that the Churches of Christ endorse the doctrine of baptismal regeneration.&lt;ref name="Foster 2001"&gt;Douglas A.

Everett, "Written Debate on Baptism"]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, members of the Churches of Christ reject this, arguing that since faith and repentance are necessary, and that the cleansing of sins is by the blood of Christ through the grace of God, baptism is not an inherently redeeming ritual.&lt;ref name="Foster 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Understanding Four Views on Baptism"/&gt;{{rp|p.133}}&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement: Regeneration"&gt;Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L.

Foster denies this contention regarding the [[Restoration Movement]] as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;"If by baptismal regeneration the accusers mean that the act of immersion inherently regenerates or converts or saves a person, then the charge is not true. From the earliest days of the Stone-Campbell Movement, the teaching has been that the only proper subjects for baptism are those who have faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and who repent of their past sins. It is the blood of Jesus that cleanses people from all sin by his grace. Baptism is not a ritual act that has inherent redeeming power. It is not true that when people "get baptized," they are automatically "born again."" Douglas A.

==Criticisms==
Critics of the doctrine frequently allege that it tends to emphasize external form (including the role of water) rather than internal belief.

Some Protestants claim that baptismal regeneration is not clearly taught in Scripture and thus contradicts their fundamental belief that all things necessary for salvation are taught in the Bible clearly enough for the ordinary believer to find them there ([[Clarity of scripture]]; also see [[Sola fide]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-highway.com/Sola_Scriptura_Godfrey.html What Do We Mean by Sola Scriptura? by Dr. W. Robert Godfrey]&lt;/ref&gt;  Evangelical, Fundamentalist, and Pentecostal Christians emphasize the need for a conversion experience that involves a personal encounter of the individual with the power of God. Generally, these denominations teach that those without such a conversion experience are not "saved" and therefore are not true Christians.&lt;ref name="Christianity.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christianity.com/BecomingAChristian/|title=Becoming A Christian|accessdate=2007-10-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071010113856/http://www.christianity.com/BecomingAChristian/| archivedate= 10 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups frequently refer to personal salvation through such an experience as being "born again."

'''Big Hill Springs Provincial Park''' is a [[provincial park]] in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. It is located {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Cochrane, Alberta|Cochrane]], {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Alberta Highway 22|Highway 22]] on [[Alberta Highway 567|Highway 567]], in [[Rocky View County]].

Big Hill Springs is located northwest of [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] at the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The main attraction is a series of small waterfalls that flow year-round over rocky terraces covered with a lush growth of shrubs and grasses; the park is also the site of an historic fish hatchery and Alberta's first commercial creamery.

==Activities==
Activities in the park include [[hiking]], scenic and [[wildlife]] viewing. A historic [[Hatchery|fish hatchery]] is also located in the park.

[[File:Biologia Centrali-Americana - Compsocerocoris elegans.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Compsocerocoris elegans]]'' as illustrated in Biologia Centrali-Americana.]]
The '''''Biologia Centrali-Americana''''' is an encyclopedia of the [[natural history]] of [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], privately issued in 215 parts from 1879 to 1915 by the editors [[Frederick DuCane Godman]] and [[Osbert Salvin]], of the [[British Museum (Natural History)]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/Bca/documentation/INOTAXAOverview.pdf|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|access-date=29 October 2017|title=INOTAXA INtegrated Open TAXonomic Access and the "Electronic Biologia Centrali-Americana"}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started by [[Alfred Maudslay]] publishing his first long-form description of [[Chichen Itza]] - Archaeology (London: R.H. Porter and Dulau, 1889-1902).

This work is still fundamental for the study of [[Neotropical]] plants and animals, because it contains almost all that was known of the [[biodiversity]] of Mexico and Central America at the time of its publication. Leading scientists of the day were the authors of the volumes. The whole series has 63 volumes with 1677 [[lithograph]] plates (more than 900 of which are in color) depicting 18,587 subjects. In total, 50,263 species are treated, of which 19,263 are described as new. [[Archaeology]] was added to the already monumental project because of new discoveries in the region.

Since the ''Biologia Centrali-Americana'' was published, several volumes have been reprinted, but on the whole the series is rare in libraries and mostly absent from Latin American research laboratories. The original volumes were printed on [[acid paper]] and have suffered from handling of the now brittle pages.

The [[Smithsonian Institution]] is currently digitizing the entire work for distribution via the internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3515">The '''Branner Earth Sciences Library and Map Collections''' is the main library supporting the [[Stanford University School of Earth, Energy &amp; Environmental Sciences]] on the [[Stanford University]] campus and part of Stanford University Libraries and Academic Information Resources (SULAIR). It was named after [[John Casper Branner]], first professor of geology and former president of Stanford University, whose book collection was the initial core of the library.
Branner Library contains more than 125,000 volumes, including 2000 serial titles, most of which are related to the earth and environmental sciences. The library  also houses a collection of over 270,000 sheet maps and the Branner [[geographic information systems|GIS]] facilities and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Derksen|first=Charlotte|title=History|url=http://library.stanford.edu/depts/branner/about/history.html|work=Branner Earth Sciences Library and Map Collections|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate=18 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319223604/http://library.stanford.edu/depts/branner/about/history.html|archivedate=19 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Branner Earth Sciences Library and Map Collections had its origins when Stanford's first faculty member and second President, John Casper Branner, began buying books as an 18-year-old student at Cornell. He continued to acquire books, maps, and reports while at the Pennsylvania and Arkansas Geological Surveys. When he came to Stanford in 1891, he and his wife brought a boxcar full of books, which became the de facto departmental library, with himself also as the university's first librarian. He oversaw its continued growth and use by colleagues and students until he sold it to the University in 1915. He continued to buy and donate books to the collection until his death in 1922. Later, during the tenure of librarian Kathryn Cutler (1939–1979) the library had been moved from its long-time location on the second floor of Geology Corner to its current location in the Mitchell Earth Sciences Building.

==Building==
Between 1968-1970, Spencer, Lee &amp; Busse provided architectural design and planning for the building that houses the Earth Sciences library. The design includes a small, permanent mineral exhibit in the Mitchell Earth Sciences Building open to the public. Most specimens are on the second floor of the Branner Library, surrounded by a spiral staircase or glass library court.

'''Buddhist vegetarianism''' is the belief that following a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] diet is implied in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s teaching. In [[Buddhism]], however, the views on vegetarianism vary between different [[Schools of Buddhism|schools]] of thought. According to [[Theravada]], the Buddha allowed his [[Buddhist monk|monks]] to eat [[pork]], [[chicken]] and [[fish]] if the monk was aware that the animal was not killed on their behalf. The [[Mahayana]] schools generally recommend a vegetarian diet; according to some [[Sutra|sutras]] the Buddha himself insisted that his followers should not eat the flesh of any sentient being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shabkar.org/scripture/sutras/index.htm Sutras on refraining from eating meat]&lt;/ref&gt; Monks of the Mahayana traditions that follow the [[Brahma Net Sutra]] are forbidden by their vows from eating flesh of any kind.

==Early Buddhism==
The earliest surviving written accounts of Buddhism are the Edicts of Asoka written by King [[Asoka]], a well-known Buddhist king who propagated Buddhism throughout Asia and is honored by both Theravada and Mahayana schools of Buddhism. The authority of the Edicts of Asoka as a historical record is suggested by the mention of numerous topics omitted as well as corroboration of numerous accounts found in the Theravada and Mahayana Tripitakas written down centuries later.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8572/2479 |website=Heidelberger OJS-Journals (Universitäts-Bibliothek Heidelberg) |title=Journal of International Association of Buddhist Studies – Asoka and Buddhism - A Reexamination : Presidential Address Given on the Occasion of the Fourth Conference of the IABS Madison, Wisconsin, August, 1980 |last=Bashram |first=A.L.  |quote=on pp 131-132 : “The Kalinga war, which according to the 13th Rock Edict, was the main factor in Asoka’s conversion to Buddhism is not mentioned in either the Theravada tradition or in the Asokavadana,  which, since it was transmitted mainly in Mahayana circles, we shall refer to it as the Mahayana tradition…”  and on page 141:”It is not wholly clear what form of Buddhism Asoka believed in, but it is evident that it was different from any form existing nowadays…Asoka’s reference to his “going forth to Sambodhi” in the 8th Rock Edict may indicate the very beginning of the concept of the bodhisattva…” |page=131-132, 141 |date=1982 |access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asoka Rock Edict 1 dated to c. 257 BCE mentions the prohibition of animal sacrifices in Asoka’s [[Maurya Empire]] as well as his commitment to vegetarianism; however, whether the Sangha was vegetarian in part or in whole is unclear from these edicts. However, Asoka’s personal commitment to, and advocating of, vegetarianism suggests Early Buddhism (at the very least for the layperson) most likely already had a vegetarian tradition (the details of what that entailed besides not killing animals were not mentioned, and therefore are unknown.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_books/5282.pdf |website=Archaeological Survey of India |title=Asoka’s Edicts |last=Sen |first=Amulyachandra |quote=“Formerly in the kitchen of the Beloved of the gods, King Priyadarsin [another name for Asoka], many hundreds of thousands of animals were killed everyday for the sake of curry.  But now when this Dharma-rescript is written, only three animals are being killed (everyday) for the sake of curry, (viz.) two peacocks (and) one deer, (and) the deer again not always. Even these three animals shall not be killed in the future.” |page=64 |date=1956 |access-date=2018-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508090318/http://asi.nic.in/asi_books/5282.pdf |archive-date=2016-05-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views of different schools ==
There is a divergence of views within Buddhism as to whether vegetarianism is required, with some schools of Buddhism rejecting such a requirement. The first precept in Buddhism is usually translated as "I undertake the precept to refrain from taking life". Some Buddhists see this as implying that Buddhists should avoid [[meat consumption]], whereas other Buddhists argue that this is untrue. Some Buddhists do strongly oppose meat-eating on the basis of scriptural injunctions against flesh-eating accorded in [[Mahayana sutras]].

=== Mahayana view ===
According to the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'', a [[Mahayana sutras|Mahayana sutra]] purporting to give [[Gautama Buddha]]'s final teachings, the Buddha insisted that his followers should not eat any kind of meat or fish, even those not included in the 10 types, and that even vegetarian food that has been touched by meat should be washed before being eaten. Also, it is not permissible for the monk or nun just to pick out the non-meat portions of a diet and leave the rest: the whole meal must be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soulcurrymagazine.com/sc/buddhism-vegetarianism-non-vegetarianism.html Buddhism &amp; Vegetarianism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021172541/http://soulcurrymagazine.com/sc/buddhism-vegetarianism-non-vegetarianism.html|date=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra]]'' quotes a dialogue between Gautama Buddha and [[Manjushri]] on meat eating:

{{quote|Mañjuśrī asked, “Do Buddhas not eat meat because of the tathāgata-garbha ?”
The Blessed One replied, “Mañjuśrī, that is so. There are no beings who have not been one’s mother, who have not been one’s sister through generations of wandering in beginningless and endless saṃsāra. Even one who is a dog has been one’s father, for the world of living beings is like a dancer. Therefore, one’s own flesh and the flesh of another are a single flesh, so Buddhas do not eat meat.
“Moreover, Mañjuśrī, the dhātu of all beings is the dharmadhātu, so Buddhas do not eat meat because they would be eating the flesh of one single dhātu.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webspawner.com/users/tathagatagarbha18/index.html Angulimaliya Sutra] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105032808/http://www.webspawner.com/users/tathagatagarbha18/index.html |date=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Certain [[Mahayana sutras]] do present the Buddha as very vigorously and unreservedly denouncing the eating of meat, mainly on the grounds that such an act is linked to the spreading of fear amongst [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] (who can allegedly sense the odour of death that lingers about the meat-eater and who consequently fear for their own lives) and violates the [[bodhisattva]]'s fundamental cultivation of compassion. Moreover, according to the Buddha in the [[Angulimaliya Sutra]], since all beings share the same "Dhatu" (spiritual Principle or Essence) and are intimately related to one another, killing and eating other sentient creatures is tantamount to a form of self-killing and cannibalism.  The sutras which inveigh against meat-eating include the [[Nirvana Sutra]], the [[Shurangama Sutra]], the [[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahmajala Sutra]], the [[Angulimaliya Sutra]], the Mahamegha Sutra, and the [[Lankavatara Sutra]]. In the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], which presents itself as the final elucidatory and definitive Mahayana teachings of the Buddha on the very eve of his death, the Buddha states that "the eating of meat extinguishes the seed of Great Kindness", adding that all and every kind of meat and fish consumption (even of animals found already dead) is prohibited by him. He specifically rejects the idea that monks who go out begging and receive meat from a donor should eat it: ". . . it should be rejected . . . I say that even meat, fish, game, dried hooves and scraps of meat left over by others constitutes an infraction . . . I teach the harm arising from meat-eating." The Buddha also predicts in this sutra that later monks will "hold spurious writings to be the authentic Dharma" and will concoct their own sutras and falsely claim that the Buddha allows the eating of meat, whereas he says he does not. A long passage in the Lankavatara Sutra shows the Buddha speaking out very forcefully against meat consumption and unequivocally in favor of vegetarianism, since the eating of the flesh of fellow sentient beings is said by him to be incompatible with the compassion that a Bodhisattva should strive to cultivate. This passage has been seen as questionable.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;[http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_eng/lanka-chapter-4.htm#chap8 The Lankavatara Sutra:Chapter Eight]&lt;/ref&gt; In a translation by [[D. T. Suzuki]], a note is made that this section:

{{quote|This chapter on meat-eating is another later addition to the text, which was probably done earlier than the Rāvaṇa chapter....It is quite likely that meat-eating was practised more or less among the earlier Buddhists, which was made a subject of severe criticism by their opponents. The Buddhists at the time of the Laṅkāvatāra did not like it, hence this addition in which an apologetic tone is noticeable.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;}}

In several other Mahayana scriptures, too (e.g., the Mahayana [[jatakas]]), the Buddha is seen clearly to indicate that meat-eating is undesirable and karmically unwholesome.

Some suggest that the rise of monasteries in Mahayana tradition to be a contributing factor in the emphasis on vegetarianism. In the monastery, food was prepared specifically for monks.  In this context, large quantities of meat would have been specifically prepared (killed) for monks.  Henceforth, when monks from the Indian geographical sphere of influence migrated to [[China]] from the year 65 CE on, they met followers who provided them with money instead of food. From those days onwards Chinese monastics, and others who came to inhabit northern countries, cultivated their own vegetable plots and bought food in the market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kundalini.org.hk/sychinese/2_buddhism_p2.htm 佛教的本相   (下)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macau-buddhism.org/39/39-2f.htm 《學佛素食與健康長壽》]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727051833/http://www.macau-buddhism.org/39/39-2f.htm|date=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This remains the dominant practice in China, Vietnam and part of Korean Mahayanan temples.

Mahayana lay Buddhists often eat vegetarian diets on the vegetarian dates (齋期). There are different arrangement of the dates, from several days to three months in each year, in some traditions, the celebration of the bodhisattva [[Avalokitesvara]]'s birthday, enlightenment and leaving home days hold the highest importance to be vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guoxue.com/discord/zz/dzps.htm 《地藏菩萨十斋日》]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theravada View ===
The Buddha in the [[Anguttara Nikaya]] 3.38 '''Sukhamala Sutta''', before his enlightenment, describes his family being wealthy enough to provide non-vegetarian meals even to his servants. After becoming enlightened, he accepted any kind of food offered with respect as alms, including meat,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/dharmadata/fdd21.htm Dharma Data: Vegetarianism]&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no reference of him eating meat during his seven years as an ascetic.

In the modern era, the passage cited below has been interpreted as allowing the consumption of meat ''if'' it is not specifically slaughtered for the recipient:
{{quote|… meat should not be eaten under three circumstances: when it is seen or heard or suspected (that a living being has been purposely slaughtered for the eater); these, [[Jivaka]], are the three circumstances in which meat should not be eaten, Jivaka! I declare there are three circumstances in which meat can be eaten: when it is not seen or heard or suspected (that a living being has been purposely slaughtered for the eater); Jivaka, I say these are the three circumstances in which meat can be eaten. —'''Jivaka Sutta''', MN 55 '', [[unpublished]] translation by [[Sister Uppalavanna]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vipassana.info/055-jivaka-e1.htm Jiivakasutta], this is an undated (and not formally published) translation by Sister Uppalavanna (b., 1886 as Else Buchholtz), originally distributed on the internet by the Sri Lankan website "Metta.LK".&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also in the Jivaka Sutta, Buddha instructs a monk or nun to accept, without any discrimination, whatever food is offered in receiving alms offered with good will, including meat, whereas the Buddha declares the meat trade to be [[Noble Eightfold Path|wrong livelihood]] in the '''Vanijja Sutta''', AN 5:177

{{quote|Monks, a lay follower should not engage in five types of business. Which five? Business in weapons, business in human beings, ''business in meat'', business in intoxicants, and business in poison. These are the five types of business that a lay follower should not engage in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/anguttara/an05-177.html Vanijja Sutta: Business (Wrong Livelihood)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119074312/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/anguttara/an05-177.html |date=November 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But this is not, strictly speaking, a dietary rule.  The Buddha, on one particular occasion, specifically refused suggestions by [[Devadatta]] to institute vegetarianism in the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha069.htm#note4 "Buddhism and Vegetarianism, The Rationale for the Buddha's Views on the Consumption of Meat"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007043230/http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha069.htm |date=2013-10-07 }} by Dr V. A. Gunasekara" 'The rule of vegetarianism was the fifth of a list of rules which Devadatta had proposed to the Buddha. Devadatta was the founder of the tapasa movement in Buddhism and his special rules involved ascetic and austere practices (forest-dwelling, wearing only rags, etc). The Buddha rejected all the proposed revisions of Devadatta, and it was in this context that he reiterated the tikoiparisuddha rule. (On this see the author's Western Buddhism and a Theravada heterodoxy, BSQ Tracts on Buddhism'&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Amagandha Sutta in the Sutta Nipata, a vegetarian Brahmin confronts [[Kassapa Buddha]] (a previous Buddha before Gautama Buddha) in regard to the evil of eating meat. The Buddha countered the argument by listing acts which cause real moral defilement and then at the end of the verse, he emphasized that the consumption of meat is not equivalent to those acts. ("... this is the stench giving defilement, not the consumption of meat").

:"[t]aking life, beating, wounding, binding, stealing, lying, deceiving, worthless knowledge, adultery; this is stench. Not the eating of meat." ('''Amagandha Sutta''').

There were monastic guidelines prohibiting consumption of 10 types of meat: that of humans, [[Elephant meat|elephants]], horses, dogs, snakes, lions, tigers, leopards, bears and hyenas. This is because these animals can be provoked by the smell of the flesh of their own kind, or because eating of such flesh would generate a bad reputation for the Sangha.

Paul Breiter, a student of [[Ajahn Chah]], states that some bhikkhus in [[Thai Forest Tradition|Thailand]] choose to be vegetarian and that [[Ajahn Sumedho]] encouraged supporters to prepare vegetarian food for the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breiter|first=Paul|title=Venerable Father|publisher=Paraview Special Editions|page=xii|year=2004|ISBN=1-931044-81-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pali Canon, Buddha once explicitly refused suggestion by [[Devadatta]] to institute vegetarianism in the monks' [[Vinaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Phelps | first = Norm | authorlink = Norm Phelps | title = The Great Compassion: Buddhism &amp; Animal Rights | year = 2004 | publisher = Lantern Books | location = New York | pages = 76 | quote =monks would have to accept whatever they found in their begging bowls, including meat, provided that they had not seen, had not heard, and had no reason to suspect that the animal had been killed so that the meat could be given to them. | isbn = 1-59056-069-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vajrayana ===
Some Vajrayana practitioners both drink alcohol &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elephantjournal.com/2009/03/mindful-drinking-vajrayana-tradition-alcohol-and-buddhism/ Mindful Drinking?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lodro-rinzler/buddhism-and-alcohol-what_b_695369.html Buddhism and Alcohol]&lt;/ref&gt; and eat meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universaldharma.com/pages/dharma%20pages/msdway.html The Maitreya Sangha Way] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717163515/http://www.universaldharma.com/pages/dharma%20pages/msdway.html |date=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rinpoche.com/teachings/nomeat.htm?page_id=52 Teaching on Not Eating Meat by His Holiness 17th Gyalwang Karmapa]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many traditions of the [[Ganachakra]] which is a type of [[Panchamakara]] [[puja (Buddhism)|puja]] prescribed the offering and ingestion of meat and alcohol, although this practice is now often only a symbolic one, with no actual meat or alcohol ingested.

One of the most important [[tertön]]s of [[Tibet]], [[Jigme Lingpa]], wrote of his great compassion for animals:
{{quote|Of all his merit-making, Jigme Lingpa was most proud of his feelings of compassion for animals; he says that this is the best part of his entire life story. He writes of his sorrow when he witnessed the butchering of animals by humans. He often bought and set free animals about to be slaughtered (a common Buddhist act). He ‘changed the perception’ of others, when he once caused his followers to save a female yak from being butchered, and he continually urged his disciples to forswear the killing of animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serv-online.org/Eileen-Weintraub.htm Life as a Vegetarian Tibetan Buddhist Practitioner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lmqSoNsRSx8C Apparitions of the Self: The Secret Autobiographies of a Tibetan Visionary]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''The Life of Shabkar, the Autobiography of a Tibetan Yogin'', [[Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol]] wrote:
{{quote|Above all, you must constantly train your mind to be loving, compassionate, and filled with [[Bodhicitta]]. You must give up eating meat, for it is very wrong to eat the flesh of our parent sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bXAUkoM0esMC ''The life of Shabkar: the autobiography of a Tibetan yogin''] page 541&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[14th Dalai Lama]] and other esteemed lamas invite their audiences to adopt vegetarianism when they can. When asked in recent years what he thinks of vegetarianism, the 14th Dalai Lama has said: "It is wonderful. We must absolutely promote vegetarianism."&lt;ref&gt;''Buddha Heart, Buddha Mind,'' 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama tried becoming a vegetarian and promoted vegetarianism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godsdirectcontact.org.tw/eng/news/160/vg6.htm Vegetarian Awakening in the Himalayas]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, it was published that the Dalai Lama would only be vegetarian every other day and partakes of meat regularly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99jan17/sunday/speaking.htm To be or not to be a vegetarian]&lt;/ref&gt; When he is in Dharamsala, he is vegetarian, but not necessarily when he is outside Dharamsala.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/page.52.htm A Routine Day of HH The Dalai Lama] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224214736/http://www.dalailama.com/page.52.htm |date=February 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul McCartney has taken him to task for this and wrote to him to urge him to return to strict vegetarianism, but "[The Dalai Lama] replied [to me] saying that his doctors had told him he needed [meat], so I wrote back saying they were wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article2099953.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Sir Paul McCartney's advice to the Dalai Lama  | date=15 December 2008 | accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]] became vegetarian in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VqgIJ8AObA]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arjia Rinpoche]] became vegetarian in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shabkar.org/teachers/tibetanbuddhism/arjia_rinpoche.htm Arjia Lobsang Thubten Rinpoche (1950 - )]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January 2007, one of the two 17th [[Karmapa]], [[Urgyen Trinley Dorje]], strongly urged vegetarianism upon his students, saying that generally, in his view, it was very important in the Mahayana not to eat meat and that even in Vajrayana students should not eat meat:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are many great masters and very great realized beings in [[India]] and there have been many great realized beings in [[Tibet]] also, but they are not saying, "I'm realized, therefore I can do anything; I can eat meat and drink alcohol." It's nothing like that. It should not be like that.
According to the [[Kagyupa]] school, we have to see what the great masters of the past, the past lamas of Kagyupas, did and said about eating meat. The Drikung Shakpa [sp?] Rinpoche, master of Drikungpa, said like this, "My students, whomever are eating or using meat and calling it tsokhor or [[Ganachakra|tsok]], then these people are completely deserting me and going against the dharma." I can't explain each of these things, but he said that anybody that is using meat and saying it is something good, this is completely against the dharma and against me and they completely have nothing to do with dharma. He said it very, very strongly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shabkar.org/download/pdf/Talk_on_Vegetarianism.pdf Talk on Vegetarianism] by Orgyen Trinle Dorje, Karmapa XVII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Common practices ==

=== Theravada ===
In the modern world, attitudes toward vegetarianism vary by location. In [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[Theravada]] countries of [[South East Asia]], monks are obliged by the [[vinaya]] to accept almost any food that is offered to them, including meat unless they suspect the meat was slaughtered specifically for them.

=== Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Taiwanese traditions ===
In [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Taiwan]] and their respective diaspora communities monks and nuns are expected to abstain from meat and, traditionally, eggs and dairy, in addition to the [[fetid]] vegetables – traditionally [[garlic]], ''[[Allium chinense]]'', [[asafoetida]], [[shallot]], and ''[[Allium victorialis]]'' (victory onion or mountain leek), although in modern times this rule is often interpreted to include other vegetables of the [[Allium|onion]] [[genus]], as well as [[coriander]] – this is called pure vegetarianism (純素, chúnsù). Pure Vegetarianism is Indic in origin and is still practiced in India by some adherents of Dharmic religions such as Jainism and in the case of Hinduism, lacto-vegetarianism with the additional abstaintion of pungent or fetid vegetables.  A minority of Buddhist lay believers are year-long vegetarians in the monastic way.  Many lay followers followed monastic style vegetarianism on Lunar New Year's Eve, Saints days and ancestral feast days as well as the 1st and 15th day of the lunar calendar. Some lay followers also followed monastic style vegetarianism on the six-day，ten-day， Guan-yin (Avalokitesvara) vegetarian, etc., set lunar calendar schedule. Other Buddhist lay-followers also follow less stringent forms of vegetarianism. Most Buddhist lay-followers however are not vegetarians. Some [[Zhaijiao]] lay adherents also do not eat any meat.

=== Japanese traditions ===
{{see also|Shōjin ryōri}}
Japan initially received [[Chinese Buddhism]] in 6th century. In the 9th century, [[Emperor Saga]] made a decree prohibiting meat consumption except fish and birds.  This remained the dietary habit of Japanese until the introduction of European dietary customs in the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  Again around the 9th century, two Japanese monks ([[Kūkai]] and [[Saichō]]) introduced Vajrayana Buddhism into Japan and this soon became the dominant Buddhism among the nobility.  In particular, Saichō, who founded the [[Tendai]] sect of Japanese Buddhism, reduced the number of vinaya code to 66. (Enkai 円戒)  During the 12th century, a number of monks from [[Tendai]] sects founded new schools ([[Zen]], [[Pure Land]]) and de-emphasised vegetarianism, [[Nichiren Buddhism]] today likewise de-emphasises vegetarianism. However, Nichiren himself practiced vegetarianism.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Zen does tend generally to look favourably upon vegetarianism. The [[Shingon]] sect founded by Kūkai recommends vegetarianism and requires it at certain times, but it is not always strictly required for monks and nuns.

=== Tibetan traditions === 
In [[Tibet]], where vegetables have been historically very scarce, and the adopted vinaya was the Nikaya Sarvāstivāda, vegetarianism is very rare, although the [[Dalai Lama]], the [[Karmapa]], and other esteemed lamas invite their audiences to adopt vegetarianism whenever they can. [[Chatral Rinpoche]] in particular stated that anyone who wished to be his student must be vegetarian. Contradictory to the compassionate Tibetan Buddhist traditions in which a sanctity of life, both human and animal, is cherished, meat is often consumed as a form of sustenance due to lack of vegetation readily available. For example, Tibetan medicine emphasizes the necessity to acquire and sustain a balance between the bodily fluids of wind (rlung), phlegm (bad kan), and bile (mkhns), in which a meatless diet would disturb and eventually lead to fatigue.  The 18th century Tibetan religious leader Jigmé Lingpa suggested that Tibetan Buddhists who wish to consume meat, but also do not want to sacrifice their religious beliefs, should recite a prayer over their plate of meat in order to purify it before it is consumed. This is said to create a favorable interconnection between the consumer and the animal, assisting it to attain a finer rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barstow|first1=Geoffrey|title=Buddhism between abstinence and indulgence: vegetarianism in the life and works of Jigmé Lingpa|journal=Journal of Buddhist Ethics|date=1 January 2013|volume=20|pages=75–104|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu.authenticate.library.duq.edu/buddhistethics/|accessdate=4 February 2015}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biogeography]], a [[taxon]] is said to have a '''cosmopolitan distribution''' if its [[range (biology)|range]] extends across all or most of the world in appropriate [[habitat]]s. Such a taxon is said to exhibit cosmopolitanism or cosmopolitism. The opposite extreme is [[endemism]].

==Related terms and concepts==
The term '''pandemism''' also is in use, but not all authors are consistent in the sense in which they use the term; some speak of pandemism mainly in referring to diseases and [[pandemic]]s, and some as a term intermediate between endemism and cosmopolitanism, in effect regarding pandemism as '''subcosmopolitanism'''. This means near cosmopolitanism, but with major gaps in the [[species distribution|distribution]], say, complete absence from Australia.&lt;ref name="Simpson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael G.

==Aspects and degrees==
The term "cosmopolitan distribution" usually should not be taken literally, because it often is applied loosely in various contexts. Commonly the intention is not to include polar regions, extreme altitudes, oceans, deserts, or small, isolated islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ecology and Environmental Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKTeiqPBpM4C&amp;pg=PA164|date=15 July 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-1324-6|pages=164–}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[housefly]] is nearly as cosmopolitan as any animal species, but it is neither oceanic nor polar in its distribution.&lt;ref name="RussellOtranto2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard C. Russell|author2=Domenico Otranto|author3=Richard L. Wall|title=The Encyclopedia of Medical and Veterinary Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9QfhF_wQSV4C&amp;pg=PA157|year=2013|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-78064-037-2|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the term "cosmopolitan weed" implies no more than that the plant in question occurs on all continents except [[Antarctica]]; it is not meant to suggest that the species is present in all regions of every continent.

==Oceanic and terrestrial==
Another concept in [[biogeography]] is that of [[Oceanography|oceanic]] cosmopolitanism and endemism. Although there is a temptation to regard the [[World Ocean]] as a medium without biological boundaries, this is far from reality; many physical and biological barriers interfere with either the spread or continued residence of many species. For example, temperature gradients prevent free migration of tropical species between the Atlantic and Indian-plus-Pacific oceans, even though there is open passage past continental masses such as the Americas and Africa/Eurasia. Again, as far as many species are concerned, the [[Southern Ocean]] and the Northern marine regions are completely isolated from each other by the intolerable temperatures of the tropical regions. In the light of such considerations, it is no surprise to find that endemism and cosmopolitanism are quite as marked in the oceans as on land.

==Ecological delimitation==
Another aspect of cosmopolitanism is that of ecological limitations. A species that is apparently cosmopolitan because it occurs in all oceans might in fact occupy only [[littoral zone|littoral zones]], or only particular ranges of depths, or only [[Estuary|estuaries]], for example. Analogously, [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] species might be present only in forests, or mountainous regions, or sandy [[arid]] regions or the like. Such distributions might be patchy, or extended, but narrow. Factors of such a nature are taken widely for granted, so they seldom are mentioned explicitly in mentioning cosmopolitan distributions.

==Regional and temporal variation in populations==
Cosmopolitanism of a particular species or variety should not be confused with cosmopolitanism of higher taxa.  For example, the family [[Antlion|Myrmeleontidae]] is cosmopolitan in the sense that every continent except Antarctica is home to some indigenous species within the Myrmeleontidae, but nonetheless no one species, nor even genus, of the Myrmeleontidae is cosmopolitan. Conversely, partly as a result of human introduction of unnatural [[Beekeeping|apiculture]] to the New World, ''[[western honey bee|Apis mellifera]]'' probably is the only cosmopolitan member of its family; the rest of the family [[Apidae]] have modest distributions.

Even where a cosmopolitan population is recognised as a single species, such as indeed ''Apis mellifera'', there generally will be variation between regional sub-populations. Such variation commonly is at the level of [[subspecies]], [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] or [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]], whereas some variation is too slight or inconsistent for formal recognition.

For an example of subspecific variation, consider the so-called "[[Africanized bee|African killer bee]]", which is the subspecies ''[[African bee|Apis mellifera scutellata]]'', and the [[African bee|Cape bee]], which is the subspecies ''[[African bee|Apis mellifera capensis]]''; both of them are in the same cosmopolitan species ''Apis mellifera'', but their ranges barely overlap.

Other cosmopolitan species, such as the [[osprey]] and [[house sparrow]], present similar examples, but in yet other species there are less familiar complications: some migratory birds such as the [[Arctic tern]] occur from the Arctic to the [[Southern Ocean]], but at any one season of the year they are likely to be largely in passage or concentrated at only one end of the range. Also, some such species breed only at one end of the range. Seen purely as an aspect of cosmopolitanism, such distributions could be seen as temporal, seasonal variations.

Other complications of cosmopolitanism on a planet too large for local populations to interbreed routinely with each other, lead to genetic effects such as [[ring species]], for example in the ''[[Larus]]'' gulls.&lt;ref name="Kunz2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Werner Kunz|title=Do Species Exist: Principles of Taxonomic Classification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQxwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT211|date=2 August 2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-3-527-66426-9|pages=211–}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also lead to the formation of [[Cline (biology)|clines]] such as in [[Drosophila]].&lt;ref name="KrimbasPowell1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Costas B. Krimbas|author2=Jeffrey R. Powell|title=Drosophila Inversion Polymorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PLSPhg3KPGgC&amp;pg=PA23|date=21 August 1992|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-6547-8|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient and modern==

Cosmopolitan distributions can be observed both in extinct and extant species. For example, ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'' was cosmopolitan in the Early Triassic after a mass extinction.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759.full.pdf |author1=Sahney, S.  |author2=Benton, M.

In the modern world, the [[killer whale]] has a cosmopolitan distribution, extending over most of the Earth's [[ocean]]s.

===Peak oil criticisms===
Yergin criticized predictions of imminent [[peak oil]], noting in 2011 that the early 21st century is the fifth period of widespread predictions that world oil production was about to fall. The four previous times when experts commonly predicted that oil production would soon decrease were: first in the 1880s, then after each of the World Wars, and again in the 1970s. He wrote that [[Hubbert peak]] theory ignores the effects of economics and technological advances. Instead of a peak, Yergin predicts future oil production will be more of a plateau, as increasing prices moderate demand and stimulate production.&lt;ref name=wsj-will&gt;Yergin, Daniel. [https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111904060604576572552998674340 "There will be oil"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fox-business&gt;{{cite web | url=http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/embed.js?id=1174676277001&amp;w=466&amp;h=263 | title=Daniel Yergin on Fox Business | work=Fox Business News | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523015259/http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/embed.js?id=1174676277001&amp;w=466&amp;h=263 | archivedate=May 23, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-raises&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Daniel|title=U.S. incentives for renewable energy raise questions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/business/worldbusiness/27iht-startup.4.5886367.html?_r=1|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ft-perils&gt;{{cite news|last=Yergin|first=Daniel|title=The Perils, Prizes and Pitfalls of a Post-Gaddafi Era of Oil|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1b0d3e0c-ee76-11e0-a2ed-00144feab49a.html#axzz1bLRABicT|accessdate=May 29, 2012|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also addressed peak oil in a chapter in ''The Quest'' entitled “Is the World Running Out of Oil?”&lt;ref name=quest-epicc&gt;’’[[The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World]]’’ New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991. {{ISBN|0-671-50248-4}}.

Yergin's skepticism toward peak oil has in turn been criticized by the theory's defenders.&lt;ref name="Oil Drum"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title=Holding Daniel Yergin and CERA Accountable |url=http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3487 | work=[[The Oil Drum]] |location=Colorado, United States |access-date=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wj-finite&gt;{{cite web

|work=Our Finite World |date=September 29, 2011 |first= Gail |last=Tverberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Jean Laherrère]] contended in 2011 that Yergin's predictions on energy production and prices omitted key facts, leading Yergin to draw incorrect conclusions.&lt;ref name=petrole&gt;{{cite news|title=Peak Oil : Laherrère responds to Yergin|url=http://petrole.blog.lemonde.fr/2011/09/26/peak-oil-laherrere-responds-to-yergin/|newspaper=[[Le Monde]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another industry observer criticized Yergin's statement in September 2007 that the price of crude oil was then higher than justified by fundamentals.&lt;ref name="Oil Drum" /&gt; At the time of Yergin's statement, the price of [[West Texas Intermediate]] oil was US$79 per barrel.

Most recently, Yergin chaired IHS Markit’s study on “Reinventing the Wheel,” which focused on changing transportation methods, the role of electric vehicles, and the timing of peak oil demand.&lt;ref name=oil-demand&gt;{{cite news  |date=September 2017 |title=Reinventing the Wheel: The future of cars, oil, chemicals, and electric power |url= https://cdn.ihs.com/www/pdf/Reinventing-the-Wheel-2017.pdf | work=IHS Markit|access-date=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earthshine Moon.jpg|thumb|220px|During the [[lunar phase|crescent phase]], the darker side of the [[Moon]] reflects indirect [[sunlight]], reflected from Earth, while the other side reflects direct sunlight.]]

'''Earthlight''' is the [[diffuse reflection]] of [[sunlight]] reflected from [[Earth]]'s surface and [[cloud]]s. '''Earthshine''' (an example of [[planetshine]]), also known as the '''Moon's ashen glow''', is the dim illumination of the otherwise dark side of the [[Moon]] by this indirect sunlight. Earthlight on the Moon during the waxing [[crescent]] is called "the old Moon in the new Moon's arms", while that during the waning crescent is called "the new Moon in the old Moon's arms".{{cn|date=February 2018}}

This phenomenon is most visible from Earth at [[night]] (or astronomical [[twilight]]) a few days before or after the day of [[new moon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sb44AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=earthlight+best+observed+after+new+moon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjahKzR0ubUAhUT-mMKHb2CCksQ6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=earthlight%20best%20observed%20after%20new%20moon&amp;f=false |title=The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science, and Art |date=1874 |publisher=Leavitt, Trow, &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[lunar phase]] is a thin crescent. On these nights, the entire lunar disk is both directly and indirectly sunlit, and is thus unevenly bright enough to see. Earthshine is most clearly seen after [[dusk]] during the waxing crescent (in the western sky) and before [[dawn]] during the waning crescent (in the eastern sky).

The term ''earthlight'' would also be suitable for an observer on the Moon seeing Earth during the lunar night, or for an [[astronaut]] inside a [[spacecraft]] looking out the window. [[Arthur C. Clarke]] uses it in this sense in his novel ''Earthlight''. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' recognizes the word.

'''Energy in Croatia''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and import in [[Croatia]].

[[Croatia]] satisfies its [[electricity]] needs largely from [[hydropower|hydro]] and [[thermal power station|thermal]] power plants, and partly from the [[Krško Nuclear Power Plant|Krško nuclear power plant]], which is co-owned by Croatian and [[Slovenia|Slovenian]] state-owned power companies.

''[[Hrvatska elektroprivreda]]'' (HEP) is the national energy company charged with production, transmission and distribution of electricity.

In 2009, electricity consumption totaled 17.5 terawatt-hours, which is about 1% less than in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hep.hr/hep/publikacije/godisnje/god2009.pdf HEP 2009 annual report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity==
===Production===
[[File:Electric energy in Croatia.png|thumb|right|325px|Energy production in Croatia]]
Total installed capacity of generating objects built in Croatia amounts to 3745 MW, 2079 MW of which is hydropower's share, and 1666 MW comes from thermal power plants. There are 25 hydroelectric power plants, most of which are located on the coast (including the single [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage hydroelectric plant]], RHE Velebit), and 7 thermal power stations, 3 of which also generate heat for industry and heating in cities. Also, 338 MW is available from the co-owned Krško nuclear power plant, and 210 MW from the privately owned Plomin 2 thermal power plant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hep.hr/proizvodnja/en/basicdata/default.aspx HEP Basic Production Data&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, domestic production amounted to 12015 GWh, which was 67.9% of total domestic demand. Remaining 32.1% was covered through trade.
Total consumption equaled 17697 GWh, a 1% decrease from 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hep.hr/ops/en/hees/data.aspx HEP electricity data&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission===
Croatian transmission grid consists of lines on three different rated voltage levels, namely 400, 220 and 110 kV. Total length of high-voltage lines is {{convert|7315|km|2|abbr=on}}.

The grid was often the target of attacks during [[Croatian War of Independence]], resulting in frequent black-outs during the period. Since then, the grid has been repaired, and reconnected to [[synchronous grid of Continental Europe]] synchronous zones 1 and 2, making it an important transit system again.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hep.hr/ops/en/hees/default.aspx HEP Croatian power system&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution===
Under the 2004 Energy law, customers in Croatia are allowed to choose their preferred distributor of electricity. However, HEP Operator distribucijskog sustava or HEP-ODS (a Hrvatska elektroprivreda subsidiary) remains the largest distributor to both industry and households. Its distribution grid is {{convert|132938|km|2|abbr=on}} long, with 26 764 transformers installed, totaling 14 170 MVA of power. 

In 2009 there were 2 310 811 customers, 90.8% of which were households.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hep.hr/ods/publikacije/godisnje2009.pdf HEP ODS 2009 annual report]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berner Tricoil Energy Recovery System atop the Center for Sustainable Landscape.jpg|thumbnail|Berner Tricoil Energy Recovery System atop the Center for Sustainable Landscapes in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]

'''Energy recovery''' includes any technique or method of minimizing the input of [[energy]] to an overall [[system]] by the [[energy transfer|exchange of energy]] from one sub-system of the overall system with another. The energy can be in any form in either subsystem, but most energy recovery systems exchange [[thermal energy]] in either [[sensible heat|sensible]] or [[latent heat|latent]] form.

In some circumstances the use of an enabling technology, either diurnal [[thermal energy storage]] or [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES, which allows heat or cold storage between opposing seasons), is necessary to make energy recovery practicable. One example is [[waste heat]] from [[air conditioning]] machinery stored in a buffer tank to aid in night time [[heating]]. Another is an STES application at a foundry in Sweden. Waste heat is recovered and stored in a large mass of native bedrock which is penetrated by a cluster of 140 heat exchanger equipped boreholes (155mm diameter) that are 150m deep. This store is used for heating an adjacent factory as needed, even months later.&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, O.; Hägg, M. (2008), [http://www.saunier-associes.com/igeia/docs/documents/projectPublications/D10-FeasabilityStudies.pdf  "Deliverable 10 – Sweden – Preliminary design of a seasonal heat storage for ITT Flygt, Emmaboda, Sweden"], IGEIA – Integration of geothermal energy into industrial applications, pp. 38–56 and 72–76, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; An example of using STES to recover and utilize natural heat that otherwise would be wasted is the [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] in [[Alberta]], Canada. The community uses a cluster of boreholes in bedrock for interseasonal heat storage, and this enables obtaining 97 percent of the year-round space heating from solar thermal collectors on the garage roofs.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Bill (June 28, 2011), [http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf "Drake Landing Solar Community"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030520/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto, pp. 1–30, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong B., Thornton J.

The chill is later recovered from the storage for summer air conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Paksoy, H.; Stiles, L. (2009), [http://underground-energy.com/Aquifer_Thermal_Energy_Cold_Storage_System_at_Richard_Stockton_College.pdf "Aquifer Thermal Energy Cold Storage System at Richard Stockton College"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112152451/http://www.underground-energy.com/Aquifer_Thermal_Energy_Cold_Storage_System_at_Richard_Stockton_College.pdf |date=2014-01-12 }}, Effstock 2009 (11th International) – Thermal Energy Storage for Efficiency and Sustainability, Stockholm.&lt;/ref&gt;  With a coefficient of performance (COP) of 20 to 40, this method of cooling can be ten times more efficient than conventional air conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen, G. 1998.

March 16 and 17, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
A common application of this principle is in systems which have an ''exhaust stream'' or ''waste stream'' which is transferred from the system to its surroundings. Some of the energy in that flow of material (often [[gas]]eous or [[liquid]]) may be transferred to the ''make-up'' or ''input'' material flow. This ''input'' [[mass]] flow often comes from the system's surroundings, which, being at ambient conditions, are at a lower temperature than the ''waste stream''. This temperature differential allows [[heat transfer]] and thus energy transfer, or in this case, recovery. Thermal energy is often recovered from liquid or gaseous waste streams to ''fresh'' ''make-up'' [[air]] and [[water]] intakes in [[buildings]], such as for the [[HVAC]] systems, or process systems.

==System approach==
[[Energy consumption]] is a key part of most human activities. This consumption involves [[energy conversion|converting one energy system to another]], for example: The conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy, which can then power computers, light, motors etc. The input energy propels the work and is mostly converted to heat or follows the product in the process as output energy. Energy recovery systems harvest the output power and provide this as input power to the same or another process.

An energy recovery system will close this energy cycle to prevent the input power from being released back to nature and rather be used in other forms of desired work.

==Examples==
* Heat recovery is implemented in heat sources like e.g. a [[steel mill]]. Heated [[cooling water]] from the process is sold for heating of homes, shops and offices in the surrounding area.
* [[Regenerative braking]] is used in electric cars, trains, heavy cranes etc. where the energy consumed when elevating the potential is returned to the electric supplier when released.
* Active pressure reduction systems where the differential pressure in a pressurized fluid flow is recovered rather than converted to heat in a pressure reduction valve and released.
* [[Energy recovery ventilation]]
* [[Energy recycling]]
* [[Water heat recycling]]
* [[Heat recovery ventilation]]
* [[Heat recovery steam generator]]
* [[Cyclone Waste Heat Engine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclonepower.com/ Cyclone Power Technologies Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) ===
Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving energy efficiency for the stationary power generation industry.

Fossil fuel based power generation is predicted to continue for decades, especially in developing economies. This is against the global need to reduce carbon emissions, of which, a high percentage is produced by the power sector worldwide.

ETC works by making gas and diesel-powered gensets (Electric Generators) work more effectively and cleaner, by recovering waste energy from the exhaust to improve power density and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* Gives independent power providers (IPPs), power rental companies and generator OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) a competitive advantage and potential increased market share.
* Improves overall efficiency of the genset, including fuel input costs and helping end-users reduce amount of fuel burned. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* Capability to increase power output and capacity, with improved fuel efficiency.
* ETC system integration offers a step change in efficiency without increasing service or maintenance requirements.
* The cost of generating power through waste heat recovery is substantially less than burning more fuel, even with low diesel prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==== Disadvantages of using ETC ====
* Upfront costs incur an additional expense for businesses.
* The need to update existing turbomachinery and recertification of the unit adds additional costs and can be time consuming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There will be additional weight to add an ETC to a current unit.
* Process still uses fossil fuels, thus still has a carbon footprint in a renewable age.
* They are bespoke to each generator so the design, build and implementation can be a lengthy process.
* There are challenges with high speed turbo generators such as high stress in the rotors, heat generation of the electrical machine and rotordynamics of the turbo generator system.

==Environmental impact==
There is a large potential for energy recovery in compact systems like large industries and utilities. Together with [[energy conservation]], it should be possible to dramatically reduce [[world energy consumption]]. The effect of this will then be:

* Reduced number of [[coal power plant|coal-fired power plants]]
* Reduced airborne particles, [[NOx]] and [[CO2]] – improved air quality
* Slowing or reducing [[climate change]]
* Lower fuel bills on transport
* Longer availability of [[crude oil]]
* Change of industries and economies not fully researched

In 2008 [[Tom Casten]], chairman of [[Recycled Energy Development]], said that "''We think we could make about 19 to 20 percent of U.S. electricity with heat that is currently thrown away by industry.''"&lt;ref name=npr2008may22&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90714692 'Recycling' Energy Seen Saving Companies Money]. By David Schaper. May 22, 2008. [[Morning Edition]]. [[National Public Radio]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 Department of Energy study found the potential for 135,000 megawatts of [[combined heat and power]] (which uses energy recovery) in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hedman, Energy and Environmental Analysis/USCHPA, "Combined Heat and Power and Heat Recovery as Energy Efficiency Options", Briefing to Senate Renewable Energy Caucus, September 10, 2007, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; and a Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory study identified about 64,000 megawatts that could be obtained from industrial waste energy, not counting CHP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/843010-3bxGVs/native/843010.pdf|title=Clean Energy Technologies: a Preliminary Inventory of the Potential for Electricity Generation, Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory, 4/05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies suggest that about 200,000 megawatts, or 20%, of total power capacity could come from [[energy recycling]] in the U.S. Widespread use of [[energy recycling]] could therefore reduce global warming emissions by an estimated 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epat2p2.html|title=The Energy Information Administration, Existing Capacity by Energy Source, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, as of 2005, about 42% of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution came from the production of electricity and 27% from the production of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html|title=Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks|work=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218171807/http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html|archivedate=2011-12-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/emission.html|title=Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the United States 2005|work=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]],}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is, however, difficult to quantify the environmental impact of a global energy recovery implementation in some sectors. The main impediments are:{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
* Lack of efficient technologies for private homes. Heat recovery systems in private homes can have an efficiency as low as 30% or less. It may be more realistic to use energy conservation like [[thermal insulation]] or improved buildings. Many areas are more dependent on forced cooling and a system for extracting heat from dwellings to be used for other uses are not widely available.
* Ineffective infrastructure. Heat recovery in particular need a short distance from producer to consumer to be viable. A solution may be to move a large consumer to the vicinity of the producer. This may have other complications.
* [[Transport sector]] is not ready. With the transport sector using about 20% of the energy supply, most of the energy is spent on overcoming gravity and friction. [[Electric car]]s with [[regenerative braking]] seem to be the best candidate for energy recovery. Wind systems on ships are under development. Very little work on the [[airline industry]] is known in this field.

It develops hanging, bright-red flowers between September and December. It is also known as the 'itchy tree': small caterpillars feed on the leaves during the wet season and cause localised skin irritation if touched. 	 
* ''[[Allosyncarpia ternata]]'' (Allosyncarpia / An-binik) – a large, hardy evergreen that is restricted to the stone country of Kakadu and Arnhem Land. 	 
* ''[[Banksia dentata]]'' (Tropical Banksia / Guibuk) – the only ''[[Banksia]]'' found in the Top End. It has distinctive serrated leaves and the characteristic banksia flower, which appears between January and April. 	 
* ''[[Brachychiton paradoxus]]'' (Red-flowered Kurrajong / An-marrenarnak) – a small, often straggly tree that is widespread on the lowlands. It is deciduous in the dry season, when bright-red bell-shaped flowers appear on short stems from the branches. 	 
* ''[[Buchanania obovata]]'' (Green Plum / An-dudjmi) – a medium-sized tree with large, thick leathery leaves. Bunches of green grape-sized plums appear in October to December; they are considered to be some of the best bush tucker around.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7745">'''Geography of aging''' or '''gerontological geography''' is an emerging field of knowledge of [[Human Geography]] that analyzes the socio-spatial implications of [[aging]] of the [[population]] from the understanding of the relationships between the [[Social environment|physical-social environment]] and the [[elderly]], at different scales, micro (City, region, country), etc.

Since the 1970s in a number of developed countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Japan]], there have been increasing studies focusing on the understanding of spatial patterns of [[aging population]], as well as aspects related to residential changes and provision of health and social services. Among the geographers of aging is S. Harper, who identified the phenomenon of aging associated with the social construction of old age and the processes of residential mobility of this group to the urban periphery, mainly nursing homes and sheltered housing.

The contribution of geographers of aging, such as Graham D. Rowles, SM. Golant, S. Harper, G. Laws, are contributing to environmental gerontology by understanding the environmental aspects of [[gerontology]] in developed and developing countries. Also in Spain, some geographers, such as Gloria Fernández-Mayoralas, Fermina Rojo-Pérez and Vicente Rodríguez-Rodríguez, have made outstanding contributions to the study of residential strategies, access to health services, and, in general, quality of Life of the elderly, as well as the impacts of Northern European retirees on the Costa del Sol (Spain).

In [[Latin America]] and [[Spain]], Diego Sánchez-González has shed light on the deepening of issues such as the physical-built and [[social environment]] and the [[quality of life]] of the [[elderly]]; the importance of the [[natural environment]] (therapeutic [[natural landscape]]) on active and [[healthy aging]] in the place; residential strategies for the maintenance of the elderly in the communities; the socio-environmental [[vulnerability]] of the elderly in the face of [[climate change]]; as well as issues related to the attachment to the place (identity and [[public space]]); elderly people with [[disabilities]] and [[social exclusion]]; [[leisure]] and [[tourism]] of elderly; and the [[planning]] of gerontological and geriatric services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42102">The '''Global Burden of Disease Study''' ('''GBD''') is a comprehensive regional and global research program of [[disease burden]] that assesses [[death|mortality]] and [[disability]] from major diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s. GBD is a collaboration of over 1,800 researchers from 127 countries. Under principal investigator [[Christopher J.L. Murray]], GBD is based out of the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] (IHME) at the [[University of Washington]] and funded by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does a $100 million public health data revolution look like?|url=http://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=17751|website=TEDMED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Global Burden of Disease Study began in 1990 as a single [[World Bank]]-commissioned&lt;ref name="sign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/announcement/institute-health-metrics-and-evaluation-and-world-health-organization-sign-new |title=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and World Health Organization sign new agreement |publisher=[[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] |accessdate=January 29, 2017 |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; study, now called GBD 1990.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt; The original project quantified the health effects of more than 100 diseases and injuries for eight regions of the world, giving estimates of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] by age, sex, and region. It also introduced the [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY) as a new metric to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s,&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Annette|last1=Prüss-Üstün|first2=C.|last2=Mathers|first3=Carlos|last3=Corvalán|first4=A.|last4=Woodward|title=Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels: Introduction and methods|year=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241546204|series=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=1|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/9241546204/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutgbd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/index.html|title=About the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project|work=Health statistics and health information systems|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/|title=Global burden of disease|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; to aid comparisons. GBD 1990 was "institutionalized" at the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the research was "conducted mainly by researchers at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and WHO".&lt;ref name="sign" /&gt;

In 2000–2002, the 1990 study was updated by WHO to include a more extensive analysis using a framework known as ''comparative risk factor assessment''.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;

The WHO estimates were again updated for 2004 in ''The global burden of disease: 2004 update'' (published in 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_full.pdf |title=''The global burden of disease: 2004 update'' |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Global health risks'' (published in 2009).&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalHealthRisks_report_Front.pdf |title=''Global health risks: mortality and burden of disease attributable to selected major risks'' |year=2009 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official DALY estimates had not been updated by WHO since 2004&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/en/ Global Burden of Disease (GBD)] at WHO, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; until the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), also known as the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/node/1366 |title=Global Burden of Disease: Massive shifts reshape the health landscape worldwide |publisher=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation |accessdate=January 30, 2017 |quote=That’s one of the main findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010), a collaborative project led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington.}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in December 2012.&lt;ref name="ihme_history" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murray CJ, Vos T, Lozano R, Naghavi M, Flaxman AD, Michaud C, etal | title=Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 291 diseases and injuries in 21 regions, 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 | journal=Lancet | year= 2013 | volume= 380 | issue= 9859 | pages= 2197–223 | pmid=23245608 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61689-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work quantified the burdens of 291 major causes of death and disability and 67 risk factors disaggregated by 21 geographic regions and various age–sex groups.&lt;ref name="GBD2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murray CJ, Ezzati M, Flaxman AD, Lim S, Lozano R, Michaud C, etal | title=GBD 2010: design, definitions, and metrics | journal=Lancet | year= 2013 | volume= 380 | issue= 9859 | pages= 2063–6 | pmid=23245602 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61899-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Watts C, Cairncross S | title=Should the GBD risk factor rankings be used to guide policy? | journal=Lancet | year= 2013 | volume= 380 | issue= 9859 | pages= 2060–1 | pmid=23245600 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62121-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; GBD 2010 had the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation as its coordinating center, but was a collaboration between several institutions including WHO and the [[Harvard School of Public Health]].&lt;ref name="GBD2010" /&gt; The work was funded by the Gates Foundation.&lt;ref name="sign" /&gt; The GBD 2010 estimates contributed to WHO's own estimates published in 2013,&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt; although WHO did not acknowledge the GBD 2010 estimates.&lt;ref name="2014_rudan"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3406781/RudanComment2013GBD.pdf |first1=Igor |last1=Rudan |first2=Kit Yee |last2=Chan |title=Global health metrics needs collaboration and competition |date=December 18, 2014 |accessdate=January 27, 2017 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62006-7 |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=385 |pages=92–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2017_doughton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/science/historic-gift-gates-foundation-gives-279-million-to-university-of-washington/ |first=Sandi |last=Doughton |title=Historic gift: Gates Foundation gives $279 million to University of Washington |publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]'' |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 25, 2017 |quote=Initially, though, IHME antagonized other health experts, who accused the Seattle institute of arrogance and failing to share data and methods.

The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) was published in 2014.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt; The first installment, "Smoking Prevalence and Cigarette Consumption in 187 Countries, 1980–2012", was published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in January, and further installments were published throughout the year.&lt;ref name="ihme_history" /&gt; IHME continued to act as the coordinating center for the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about/history |title=GBD History |publisher= Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation |accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) was published.&lt;ref name="ihme_history" /&gt; The work was still coordinated at IHME.

==Aims==

The GBD has three specific aims:

#To systematically incorporate information on non-fatal outcomes into the assessment of the health status (using a time-based measure of healthy years of life lost due either to premature mortality or to years lived with a disability, weighted by the severity of that disability)
#To ensure that all estimates and projections were derived on the basis of objective epidemiological and demographic methods, which were not influenced by advocates.
#To measure the burden of disease using a metric that could also be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions. The metric chosen was the DALY.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The burden of disease can be viewed as the gap between current health status and an ideal situation in which everyone lives into old age free of disease and disability. Causes of the gap are premature mortality, disability and exposure to certain risk factors that contribute to illness.

==Results==

The 2013 report showed that global [[life expectancy]] for both sexes increased from 65.3 years in 1990, to 71.5 years in 2013,&lt;ref name="Lancet2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators| date=2014|title=Global, regional, and national age–sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=The Lancet|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–171|issn=0140-6736|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmid=25530442|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the number of deaths increased from 47.5 million to 54.9 million over the same interval.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt; Progress varied widely across [[demographic]] and national groups. Reductions in age-standardised death rates for [[cardiovascular diseases]] and [[cancers]] in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from [[diarrhoea]], [[lower respiratory infections]] and neonatal causes in low-income regions drove the changes. [[HIV/AIDS]] reduced life expectancy in southern [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell, while for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates.

Global deaths from injury increased by 10.7%, from 4.3 million deaths in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21%.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt; For some causes of more than 100,000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, [[pancreatic cancer]], [[atrial fibrillation]] and flutter, drug use disorders, [[diabetes]], [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle-cell anaemias]]. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes and malaria remain in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important [[pathogens]] are [[rotavirus]] for diarrhoea and [[pneumococcus]] for lower respiratory infections.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt;

GBD 2015 found that for the first time, annual deaths from [[measles]] had fallen below 100,000 in 2013 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/11/16/vaccinations-vaccine-science-and-a-new-us-president/ |title=Vaccinations, Vaccine Science, and a New US President {{!}} Speaking of Medicine |publisher=[[PLOS]] |date=November 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 31, 2017 |author=Peter Hotez |quote=Those results include new findings just released by the Gates Foundation-supported Global Burden of Disease 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators that found a 75 percent reduction in global measles mortality over the last decade such that (for the first time ever) fewer than 100,000 children died from measles in 2013 and 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl3&amp;pii=S0140673614616822 |title=Table 3: Selected causes of global child deaths in 1990 and 2013 |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl5&amp;pii=S0140673616310121 |title=Table 5: Global deaths in 2005 and 2015 for all ages and both sexes combined and age-standardised death rates, with percentage change between 2005 and 2015 for 249 causes |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that the global annual rate of new HIV infections has largely stayed the same during the past 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/global-rate-of-new-hiv-infections-hasn-t-fallen-in-a-decade-1.20305 |publisher=Nature News &amp; Comment |title=Global rate of new HIV infections hasn't fallen in a decade |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |author=Nisha Gaind |date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GBD 2015 also introduced the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) as a measure of a location's socio-demographic development that takes into account average income per person, educational attainment, and [[total fertility rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/global-burden-disease-study-2015-gbd-2015-socio-demographic-index-sdi-1980%E2%80%932015 |title=Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) 1980–2015 |website=GHDx |accessdate=February 7, 2017 |publisher=[[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/there-s-a-new-ranking-of-the-healthiest-countries-how-is-yours-doing/ |title=There's a new ranking of the healthiest countries.

British involvement in the Iraqi oil industry dates to [[World War I]]. Political influence in the region has given Great Britain the power to establish a number of oil companies in Iraq.

== History ==
In the early twentieth century, use of oil rapidly increased. This was first demonstrated during [[World War I]], when the [[Great power|major powers]] relied on oil to power newly-built naval ships and vehicles. Oil was needed not only for war, but for production in the civilian economy. Britain had to turn elsewhere to address its growing oil needs.

As [[William I, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm I]] and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan struggled to reassert Ottoman dominion over the [[Sheikhdom of Kuwait]], the [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|British viceroy]] of the [[colonial government in India]] entered into an agreement with Sheikh [[Mubarak Al-Sabah]] which created a [[British protectorate]] in Kuwait. Britain needed a supply of petroleum which was not controlled by contemporary rivals such as [[Russia]], [[Germany]], or the [[Netherlands]]. British Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]] wanted to replace Britain's [[coal]]-burning naval vessels with fuel-burning ships. This shift was crucial for Britain's [[History of the Royal Navy#Two-power standard|two-power standard]], which held that Britain's navy should have as many ships as the next two largest fleets combined. The new fuel-burning ships would be called [[dreadnought]]s. Since [[Persia]] was within Britain's sphere of influence, Britain pursued its interests in the [[Persian Gulf]] rather than the [[United States]] or [[Mexico]]; at the time, [[Standard Oil]] controlled 43 percent of the global market. In 1909, after oil was discovered in [[Iran]], [[William Knox D'Arcy]] became director of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]]; however, concessionary rights in [[Mosul Vilayet]] and [[Baghdad Vilayet]] continued to be elusive.&lt;ref name=black07&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons| isbn = 978-0-471-70895-7| last = Black| first = Edwin| title = Banking on Baghdad: Inside Iraq's 7,000-Year History of War, Profit, and Conflict| chapter=7. The Race to Monopolize | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVScQYzhx5oC |date = 2004-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of their [[colonial empire]] allowed Britain to ensure that oil kept flowing into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain's Legacy in the Middle East: Iraq's Oil|url=https://www.theglobalist.com/britains-legacy-in-the-middle-east-iraqs-oil/|accessdate=17 May 2018|publisher=The Globalist - Rethinking globalization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq, from 1918 until its independence in 1931, was known as [[Mandatory Iraq]]. Britain controlled the oil-rich territory and began to influence the development of its oil, including a guarantee of an oil-trading deal.

Britain entered into the 1916 [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]], a secret pact with [[France]] which defined the countries' spheres of influence in [[Western Asia]]. The two countries had agreed to divide the region's fertile areas, and the British realised that they had ceded much of Iraq's oil-potential areas to the French. To secure the oil reserves, British forces captured the city of [[Mosul]]; this created a power struggle with France. In 1927, the British began major oil exploration and discovered large oil deposits in the province surrounding Mosul. The United States also began to insert itself into the power struggle due to its goal of securing influence in the region. Growing transatlantic pressure led the British and French to sell some of their consortium stakes to the United States.&lt;ref name="onceupon"&gt;{{cite news|title=Once Upon a Red Line: The Iraq Petroleum Company Story|url=https://www.geoexpro.com/articles/2013/06/once-upon-a-red-line-the-iraq-petroleum-company-story|accessdate=25 May 2018|publisher=GEO ExPro}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British, still the dominant colonial power, secured nearly half of Iraq’s oil reserves for themselves.&lt;ref name="onceupon"/&gt; The negotiations took six years, and ended with the July 1928 [[Red Line Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Great Power Conflict over Iraqi Oil: World War I era|url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/185-general/40479-great-power-conflict-over-iraqi-oil-the-world-war-i-era.html|accessdate=16 May 2018|publisher=Global Policy Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later in the century, Iraq was one of the five founding members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ([[OPEC]]) and began nationalising its oil fields in 1961.&lt;ref name="pastpresentfuture"&gt;{{cite article|title=Iraq's Oil Sector: Past, Present and Future|url=https://www.bakerinstitute.org/media/files/page/97579f52/noc_iraq_jaffe.pdf|accessdate=16 May 2018|publisher= The James A. Baker III Institute For Public Policy Rice University}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the nationalisation of its oil, Iraq created the [[Iraq National Oil Company]].&lt;ref name="onceupon"/&gt; In 1976, after the nationalisation of its oil industry, Iraq established a [[Ministry of Oil (Iraq)|Ministry of Oil]]. The ministry was tasked with planning and creating petroleum infrastructure, and established oil companies. Iraq increased its oil production; it was the third largest oil-producing country in the world in 1979, with an output of four million barrels per day.&lt;ref name="pastpresentfuture"/&gt; Increasing oil production lead to the establishment of an Iraqi petroleum company which was shared by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[BP|British Petroleum and Mobil]], and [[Exxon]]. The company had a monopoly on Iraq's oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What is the history of oil in Iraq|url=https://usiraq.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=000907|accessdate=25 May 2018|publisher=ProCon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of oil in Iraq ==
Oil, as a natural resource and a commodity, can be identified as a contributor to war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why you can't explain the Iraq War without mentioning oil|url=https://theconversation.com/why-you-cant-explain-the-iraq-war-without-mentioning-oil-59352|accessdate=25 May 2018|publisher=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gulf War|Gulf]] and [[Iraq War]]s, oil and its flow to other countries were factors considered by Iraq and the other countries involved in the conflict. Although political changes, economic sanctions, and war created instability in Iraq's oil production, its production could still affect future oil trends.&lt;ref name="pastpresentfuture"/&gt; According to senior British Army official in Iraq James Ellery, "Iraq holds the key to stability in the region, due to its relatively large, consuming population," possessing "the second-largest reserve of oil – under-exploited", and its geostrategic location "on the routes between Asia, Europe, Arabia and North Africa ... the Silk Road."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/20/iraq-war-oil-resources-energy-peak-scarcity-economy|title=Iraq invasion was about oil|last=Nafeez|first=Ahmed|publisher=The Guardian|date=20 Mar 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the ongoing [[Iraq conflict (2003–present)|Iraq conflict]], the country's oil-production capability reached 2.5 to 2.7 million barrels per day (b/d). The estimate dropped to 1.5&amp;nbsp;million b/d in 2003 and climbed back to 2.06 million b/d in early 2006.&lt;ref name="pastpresentfuture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/a/maps-explain-crisis-iraq|title=27 maps that explain the crisis in Iraq|author=|date=|website=vox.com|accessdate=16 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601010626/http://www.vox.com/a/maps-explain-crisis-iraq|archivedate=1 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current Iraqi production capacity is estimated by the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) at below five million b/d.&lt;ref name="pastpresentfuture"/&gt; This figure is expected to rise to 6.5 million b/d by 2022, since [[Baghdad]] and the oil companies have agreed to boost [[Petroleum|crude-oil]] production in the country.&lt;ref name="approves"&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq Approves Oil Production Capacity Boost|url=https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iraq-Approves-Oil-Production-Capacity-Boost.html|accessdate=8 May 2018|publisher=Oil Price.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Future of Oil in Iraq|url=http://www.sustainableamerica.org/blog/the-future-of-oil-in-iraq/|accessdate=17 May 2018|publisher=Sustainable American Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Economic interests and implications ===
Crude oil, one of the Iraqi government's most important revenue sources, will continue to be valued for the foreseeable future due to the country's lack of diversification options.&lt;ref name="pastpresentfuture"/&gt; According to the [[World Bank]], more than 65 percent of Iraq's 2016 GDP derived from the oil sector.&lt;ref name="subsidyreform"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandiera, Luca; Celiku, Bledi; Maseeh, Ashwaq Natiq|title=Iraq economic monitor - From war to reconstruction and economic recovery : with a special focus on energy subsidy reform|date=2018|page=5|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/771451524124058858/pdf/125406-WP-PUBLIC-P163016-Iraq-Economic-Monitor-text-Spring-2018-4-18-18web.pdf|publisher=World Bank Group|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety percent of the Iraqi government’s 2016 revenue came from oil,&lt;ref name="subsidyreform"/&gt; which makes up nearly all of Iraq's exports.&lt;ref name="subsidyreform"/&gt; 
Although oil investment has recently increased, the government needs to cut expenditures due to falling oil prices (a 63-percent drop between 2014 and 2016) and is focusing on non-oil investments.&lt;ref name="subsidyreform"/&gt;

Iraq's dependence on crude oil has had negative implications for the country and has made it a focus of international discussion. This was demonstrated in the 2016 OPEC production-cut deal, in which all 14 members of the organisation agreed to cut oil production to 32.5 million b/d to stabilise the drop in oil prices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=OPEC reaches agreement to cut oil production to 32.5 million barrels a day: Oil Ministers|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/30/opec-reportedly-reaches-agreement-to-cut-oil-production.html|accessdate=8 May 2018|publisher=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to further discussions of Iraq’s dependence on oil.&lt;ref name="approves"/&gt; Iraqi oil minister [[Jabbar Alluaibi]] said in a 2016 interview that his country's crude-oil reserves are larger than forecast, with previous estimates of 143 billion barrels expanded to 153 billion barrels. If this proves true, Iraq would have the world's largest oil reserves.&lt;ref name="approves"/&gt;

The Iraq conflict, which began with the 2003 invasion, has had significant effects on the country's oil situation. Iraq and its oil industry suffered from the wars and sanctions, increasing the need for  international cooperation and investment. Operations of the most prominent British oil companies, [[BP]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supermajors - Largest Oil Companies|url=http://www.oilprices.org/largest-oil-companies.html|accessdate=17 May 2018|publisher=OilPrices.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Kirkuk]] and [[Rumaila]] regions were also affected by the conflict and have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khadduri|first1=Walid|title=Te Iraq Inquiry: UK interests in Iraqi oil|journal=International Journal of Contemporary Iraqi Studies|date=2017|volume=11|issue=1 &amp; 2|pages=75–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== {{anchor|Kirkuk oil field}}Kirkuk ===
The [[Kirkuk Field|Kirkuk oil field]], in northern Iraq near Kirkuk, is over 100 kilometers long and up to four kilometers wide and has estimated reserves of about nine billion barrels of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oil and Gas Fields: Kirkuk|url=http://www.iraq-businessnews.com/list-of-oil-and-gas-fields-in-iraq/oil-and-gas-fields-kirkuk/|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=Iraq Business News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of Iraq's largest. Due to the conflict between the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] and Baghdad, oil from the Kirkuk field has been a contested issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=U.S. Energy Information Administration|title=Country Analysis Brief: Iraq|date=2016|pages=9f.|url=https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=IRQ|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] seized control of Kirkuk and its oil field in 2014, the central government re-occupied the region in October 2017 after the Peshmerga ignored an Iraqi deadline to withdraw from the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baghdad: Iraqi forces in full control of Kirkuk|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/baghdad-iraqi-forces-full-control-kirkuk-171016133409720.html|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=www.aljazeera.com.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2018, the Iraqi government and BP signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] with the goal to increase production output of Kirkuk to an aspired level of 750,000 barrels/day. BP announced that the company will provide technological support and expertise to develop the field.&lt;ref name="strikes"/&gt; 
In late February 2018, the Iraqi government and the Kurdish Regional Government reached an agreement about the production and exporting of oil from Kirkuk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kurdish-Iraqi Deal Could Restore Oil Production|url=https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Kurdish-Iraqi-Deal-Could-Restore-Oil-Production.html|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=OilPrice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 2018, Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said that BP signed an agreement with Iraq’s  North Oil Company in the southern Iraqi city of Basra to raise production capacity from six fields in the Kirkuk region to a total of more than 1 million bpd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-oil-kirkuk/iraq-bp-sign-kirkuk-oilfield-development-contract-official-says-idUSKBN1I81SD|title=Iraq, BP sign Kirkuk oilfield development contract, official says|last=Mohammed|first=Aref|publisher=Reuters|date=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Handbook of British Birds''''' was a pioneering bird guide by [[Henry Witherby|H.F. Witherby]], [[Francis Charles Robert Jourdain|Rev. F.C.R. Jourdain]], [[Norman Ticehurst|Norman F. Ticehurst]] and [[Bernard Tucker|Bernard W. Tucker]], published in five volumes by [[H. F. &amp; G. Witherby]] between 1938-1941.

==The Handbook==

''The Handbook'', as it was often cited, was itself a much enlarged and revised version of H.F. Witherby's ''Practical Handbook of British Birds'' (published between 1919 and 1924 as two volumes in three parts).

Some of the plates were by [[Marinus Adrianus Koekkoek the Younger]] and were licensed after they were painted for ''Ornithologia Neerlandica, de vogels van Nederland'' by [[Eduard Daniel van Oort]] (published 1922-1935).

''The Handbook'' was reprinted a number of times, until at least the eight impression in 1958. The later printings (they were not described as new [[First edition|editions]]) having a few pages devoted to "additions and corrections" to previous "impressions", but few of these are of great significance. In only a few cases was the main text correspondingly corrected.

Eventually, it was superseded by [[The Birds of the Western Palearctic]].

A single-volume concise edition, ''The Popular Handbook of British Birds'' was produced by [[Philip Hollom]] in 1952. It used descriptions drawn from the ''Handbook'' and updated accounts of their status and distribution. Revised editions appeared in 1955, 1962, 1968 and 1988. These editions were far more heavily revised than those of the original ''Handbook'', not least to take account of changes in bird taxonomy, as described in each edition's new forward.

===Fourth edition===

(SBN 85493 002 7&lt;!-- Yes, SBN not ISBN --&gt;)

The 1968 edition complied with the then-new [[British Ornithologists' Union]] checklist, and incorporated further research by [[J. L. F. Parslow]]. Its 511 numbered pages described 330 species. The eggs of all breeding species were illustrated, at life size, mostly in colour

===Fifth edition===

({{ISBN|0-85493-169-4}}&lt;!-- first with ISBN --&gt;)

Produced in 1988, this was the first edition not to include the forewords from preceding editions. The entire text was reset, the status and distribution accounts were again revised, and the species sorted into the then-current taxonomic order, ending with the [[bunting (bird)|buntings]]. The jacket illustration showed [[blue tit]], [[coal tit]] and [[long-tailed tit]], with a [[great spotted woodpecker]] on the spine, and was by Norman Arlott. 350 species were described. It ran to 486 numbered pages.

==Popular Handbook of Rarer British birds==

Hollom also produced the supplemental ''The Popular Handbook of Rarer British Birds'', in 1960. It described over 100 species omitted, on the grounds of their scarcity in Britain, from the ''Popular Handbook'', about 30 of which had not occurred there at the time of the original ''Handbook''. New plates were specially commissioned from [[David Morrison Reid Henry|David Reid-Henry]] (and one, of a [[Baikal teal]], by [[Peter Scott]]), to add to those re-used from the ''Handbook''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8544">'''Hydraulic redistribution''' refers to the mechanism by which some [[vascular plant]]s redistribute soil water. It occurs in vascular plants that commonly have roots in both wet soil and extremely dry soil, especially plants with both [[taproot]]s that grow vertically down to the [[water table]], and [[lateral roots]] that sit close to the surface.

==Process==
Hot, dry periods, when the surface soil dries out to the extent that the lateral roots exude whatever water they contain, will result in the death of such lateral roots unless the water is replaced. Similarly, under extreme wet conditions when lateral roots are inundated by flood waters, oxygen deprivation will also lead to root peril. In plants that exhibit hydraulic redistribution, there are [[xylem]] pathways from the taproots to the laterals, such that the absence or abundance of water at the laterals creates a pressure potential analogous to that of [[transpirational pull]]. In drought conditions, [[ground water]] is drawn up through the taproot to the laterals and exuded into the surface soil, replenishing that which was lost. Under flooding conditions, plant roots perform a similar function in the opposite direction. For a visualization of this process, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230601/http://dawsonlab.synthasite.com/resources/Hydraulic%20Redistribution%20Cartoon.JPG "Hydraulic Redistribution Cartoon," Dawson Lab, UC Berkeley, CA]

Though often referred to as '''hydraulic lift''', movement of water by the plant roots has been shown to occur in any direction.&lt;ref&gt;S.S.O. Burgess, M.A. Adams, N.C. Turner, C.R. Beverly, C.K. Ong, A.A.H. Khan, and T.M.

Burgess and T.M. Bleby (2006), Redistribution of soil water by lateral roots mediated by stem tissues, Journal of Experimental Botany, 57:12, 3283-3291&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulze et al. 1998"&gt;E.D.

Trimborn (1998), Downward flux of water through roots (i.e. inverse hydraulic lift) in dry Kalahari sands, Oecologia, 115, 460-462&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The movement of this water can be explained by the theory of water transport through a plant.  This well established theory is called the [[cohesion-tension theory]].   In brief, it states that movement of water through the plant depends on having a continuous column of water, from the roots to the leaves.  Water is then pulled from the roots to the leaves, through the plant system, by the difference in water potential between the [[boundary layer]]s of the [[soil]] and the [[atmosphere]].  Therefore, the driving force for moving water through a plant is the cohesive strength of water molecules and a pressure gradient from the roots to the leaves.  This theory can still be applied when the boundary layer to the atmosphere is closed, e.g. when [[plant]] [[stomata]] are closed or in senesced plants.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Leffler, M.S. Peek, R.J. Ryel, C.Y. Ivans, and M.M. Caldwell (2005), Hydraulic redistribution through the root systems of senesced plants, Ecology, 86, 633-642&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure gradient is between soil layers with different water potentials; water moves through the roots from wetter to drier soil layers in the same manner as it does when the plant is transpiring.

==Significance==
The [[ecological]] importance of hydraulically redistributed water is becoming better understood as this phenomenon is more carefully examined.  Water redistribution by plant roots has been found influencing crop irrigation, where watering schemes leave a harsh heterogeneity in soil moisture.  The plant roots have been shown to smooth or homogenize the soil moisture.  This sort of smoothing out of soil moisture is important in maintaining plant root health.  The redistribution of water from deep moist layers to shallow drier layers by large trees has shown to increase the moisture available in the daytime to meet the transpiration demand.

The implications of hydraulic redistribution seem to have an important influence on plant [[ecosystem]]s.  Whether or not plants redistribute water through the soil layers can affect plant [[population dynamics]], such as the facilitation of neighboring species.&lt;ref&gt;M.M. Caldwell, T.E. Dawson, and J.H. Richards (1998), Hydraulic lift: consequences of water efflux from the roots of plants, Oecologia, 113, 151-161&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase in available daytime soil moisture can also offset low transpiration rates due to drought (''see also [[drought rhizogenesis]]'') or alleviate competition for water between competing plant species.  Water redistributed to the near surface layers may also influence plant nutrient availability.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Ryel, M.M. Caldwell, C.K. Yoder, D. Or, and A.J. Leffler (2002), Hydraulic redistribution in a stand of ''Artemisia tridentata'': evaluation of benefits to transpiration assessed with a simulation model, Oecologia, 130, 173-184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations and modeling==
Due to the ecological significance of hydraulically redistributed water, there is an ongoing effort to continue the categorization of plants exhibiting this behaviour and adapting this physiological process into land-surface models to improve model predictions.

Traditional methods of observating hydraulic redistribution include Deuterium isotope traces,&lt;ref name="Smart et al. 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawson 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulze et al. 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.R.

The '''Interior Low Plateaus''' are a physiographic region in eastern United States.  It consists of a diverse landscape that extends from north Alabama across central Tennessee and Kentucky into southern Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Its natural communities are a matrix of temperate forests, woodlands, and prairies.

==Setting==
This is a region of rolling plains and eroded plateaus, with a temperate continental climate. It is notable for its extensive karst limestone, which comprise the caves at [[Mammoth Cave National Park]].
This region includes a portion of what the U.S. Forest service calls the "Central Hardwood Forest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/2317|title=The Central Hardwood Forest: Its Boundaries and Physiographic Provinces|last=Fralish|first=James S.|year=2003|work=General Technical Report NC-234|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service, North Central Research Station|pages=3|accessdate=2008-10-05}} (cites definition by [[Emma Lucy Braun|Braun]] 1950)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The underlying bedrock of the Interior Low Plateaus consists of sedimentary rocks such as limestone, sandstone, and shale. These date from the [[Ordovician period]] in the [[Nashville Basin]] and [[Bluegrass region]], up to the [[Carboniferous Period]] in the [[Shawnee Hills]].&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Ron |date=2005 |title=Plant Life of Kentucky |url= |location= |publisher=The University Press, Kentucky |pages=14–15 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Interior Low Plateaus lie at the southern edge of the glacial boundary. Unlike the [[till plain]] to the north, the underlying bedrock is generally close to the surface, and the topography of an area depends on how resistant the underlying bedrock is to erosion. More resistant sandstones have resulted in hillier areas such as the Norman Upland and Crawford Upland in Southern Indiana, while softer limestones have already eroded down to gently rolling plains, like the Scottsburg Lowlands and Wabash Lowlands of southeast and southwest Indiana. The hillier parts of the Interior Low Plateaus are not mountain ranges, but [[dissected plateau]]s.

==Natural Communities==
The natural communities in this region are a matrix of forest, woodlands, and prairie. Today, much of the open prairie and savanna communities have been lost due to fire suppression and agriculture. However, oak-hickory woodlands remain relatively common, and mesic forest is abundant along riparian areas.

===Woodlands===
Oak-hickory woodland is the most common natural community in the Interior Low Plateaus. It is the dominant natural community for many areas of rolling hills, including the Western Highland Rim, Shawnee Hills, and Outer Bluegrass. These woodlands represent an intermediate state between a forest and a savanna, with a moderate historical fire frequency. Today, many remnants have transitioned into mesic forest due to fire suppression.

Common trees in this community include post oak (''[[Quercus stellata]]''), white oak (''[[Quercus alba]]''), southern red oak (''[[Quercus falcata]]''), black oak (''[[Quercus velutina]]''), and pignut hickory (''[[Carya glabra]]''). In more calcareous areas, common woodland trees include Shumard oak (''[[Quercus shumardii]]''), Chinquapin oak (''[[Quercus muhlenbergii]]''), and Carolina shagbark (''[[Carya carolinae-septentrionalis]]''). In more acidic dry woodlands there are stands of chestnut oak (''[[Quercus montana]]'') and Virginia pine (''[[Pinus virginiana]]''). In swampy fragipan flats, woodlands consist of willow oak (''[[Quercus phellos]]''), overcup oak (''[[Quercus lyrata]]''), pin oak (''[[Quercus palustris]]''), sweetgum (''[[Liquidambar styraciflua]]''), and blackgum (''[[Nyssa sylvatica]]'').&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; The woodlands in this region contain a rich sun-loving herbaceous layer, with many species of goldenrod (''[[Solidago]]''), sunflower (''[[Helianthus]]''), and aster (''[[Symphyotrichum]]'').

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Prairie and Savanna===
The flat surfaces of the Interior Low Plateaus historically contained extensive areas of open prairie. This fire-maintained community was concentrated in the areas of the [[Mitchell Plain]] and [[Pennyroyal Plain]] with smaller areas of prairie in the [[Nashville Basin]] and [[Highland Rim]]. Early settlers describe these areas as nearly treeless expanses, containing [[Greater prairie chicken]] and herds of Bison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southeastveg.blogspot.com/2015/01/pennyroyal-plain-prairies-of-tennessee.html Pennyroyal Plain Prairies, by Dwayne Estes, Botanical Research Institute of Texas]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some prairie remains in areas that are managed by controlled burns, or other forms of tree removal such as powerline and roadside clearings.&lt;ref name=chester&gt;{{cite book |last=Chester |first=Edward |date=2015 |title=Guide to the Vascular Plants of Tennessee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dry prairies are the most common remnant in this region, due to their unsuitability for agriculture and resistance to succession. They are dominated by ''[[Schizachyrium scoparium]]'' (little bluestem) and ''[[Aristida purpurascens]]'' (three-awn grass). Mesic prairies are rarer, and are dominated by very tall grasses such as Indian grass (''[[Sorghastrum nutans]]''), big bluestem (''[[Andropogon gerardi]]''), and plume grass (''[[Erianthus alopecuroides]]''). Wet prairies are the rarest and most poorly-documented grassland type in this region. The few existing remnants have species such as gamagrass (''[[Tripsacum dactyloides]]''), prairie cordgrass (''[[Spartina pectinata]]''), and many rushes (''[[Juncus]]'') and sedges (''[[Carex]]''). Significant prairie remnants now remain at [[Ft. Campbell]] and [[Arnold Air Force Base]], as well as in a few small nature preserves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campbell.army.mil/SiteAssets/Environmental/The%20Barrens%20Final%206%2028%2016.pdf The Barrens, Cultural Resources Program of Fort Campbell]&lt;/ref&gt; Blackjack oak (''[[Quercus marilandica]]'') was reportedly one of the few trees that could occasionally survive the annual wildfires in the prairies.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Forests===
Due to fire suppression, forests have replaced many areas of former oak woodland. However, closed-canopy forests in this region are also naturally found in many areas, such as riparian zones, river bottoms, and dissected terrain.

Mesic forests are often found in narrow stream gorges. These forests have a particularly rich diversity in spring wildflowers. They are dominated by sugar maple (''[[Acer saccharum]]''), beech (''[[Fagus grandifolia]]''), basswood (''[[Tilia americana]]''), northern red oak (''[[Quercus rubra]]''), and tuliptree (''[[Liriodendron tulipifera]]''). In the Eastern Highland Rim, at the edge of the Cumberland Plateau, these forests develop a more Appalachian character, and contain species such as eastern hemlock (''[[Tsuga canadensis]]''), yellow buckeye (''[[Aesculus flava]]''), and cucumber magnolia (''[[Magnolia tripetala]]'').&lt;ref name=chester/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; Acidic sandstone cove forests in the Shawnee Hills also contain more typically Appalachian species such as yellow birch (''[[Betula alleghaniensis]]'') and umbrella magnolia (''[[Magnolia tripetala]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Marion |date=1997 |title=The Natural Heritage of Indiana |publisher=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Floodplain forests in the Interior Low Plateau remain relatively common, although many areas have been converted to agriculture. These forests are dominated by sugarberry (''[[Celtis laevigata]]''), boxelder (''[[Acer negundo]]''), silver maple (''[[Acer saccharinum]]''), and sycamore (''[[Platanus occidentalis]]'').&lt;ref name= Jones/&gt;

Forests were particularly common in the uplands of the [[Bluegrass region|Inner Bluegrass]] region of Kentucky, which has naturally mesic conditions. These forests were dominated by sugar maple (''[[Acer saccharum]]''), bitternut hickory (''[[Carya cordiformis]]''), Ohio buckleye (''[[Aesculus glabra]]''), blue ash (''[[Fraxinus quadrangulata]]''), and chinquapin oak (''[[Quercus muhlenbergii]]''). This community is now quite rare in the Inner Bluegrass due to logging by early European settlers. Its destruction was so rapid and complete, that mid-20th century ecologists mistook the successional state of the Bluegrass as its natural condition. Sun-loving species such as hackberry (''[[Celtis occidentalis]]''), black cherry (''[[Prunus serotina]]''), black walnut (''[[Juglans nigra]]''), and white ash (''[[Fraxinus americana]]'') now dominate much of the Bluegrass region.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30142885 |title=Anthropogenic Disturbance and the Formation of Oak Savanna in Central Kentucky, USA  |journal=  Journal of Biogeography  |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=965–975 |first1=Ryan |last1=McEwan |first2=Brian |last2=McCarthy|date=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01857.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Historical evidence for forest composition in the Bluegrass Region in Kentucky |url= http://bluegrasswoodland.com/uploads/CHvolume07page231.pdf |journal=  Proceedings of the Seventh Central Hardwood Forest Conference, 5–8 March 1989 |pages=231–246 |first1=Julian |last1=Campbell |date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Barrens and Glades===
Barrens are open treeless areas on slopes, often with shallow soil. These are found sporadically in the Outer Bluegrass, Inner Nashville Basin, Shawnee Hills, and in parts of the Highland Rim. It is unclear whether these communities rely on fire for their openness, or are maintained by soil conditions alone.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; They are usually dominated by short grasses such as little bluestem (''[[Schizachyrium scoparium]]''), and large showy forbs such as prairie dock (''[[Silphium terebinthinaceum]]'') and blazing star (''[[Liatris]]''). Barrens are particularity abundant and well-preserved in the area of Adams County, Ohio, which includes [[Adams Lake State Park|Adams Lake Prairie]], [[Lynx Prairie]], [[Chaparral Prairie State Nature Preserve|Chaparral Prairie]], and others.

[[Cedar glades|Glades]] are areas of flat rock exposures of bedrock. In the Nashville Basin, glades are most often found in areas that were a matrix of barren and woodland communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fws.gov/Asheville/pdfs/Curricula-TNcedar%20glades.pdf The Cedar Glade Ecosystems of Middle Tennessee]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to fire suppression and other land-use changes, many are now surrounded by dense thickets of redcedar (''[[Juniperus virginiana]]'') and redbud (''[[Cercis canadensis]]''). Glades are most common the Nashville Basin, although there are rare examples found in the Mitchell Plain, Pennyroyal Plain and Outer Bluegrass. Glades have a flora adapted to extreme dry conditions in the summer, and standing water in the spring.&lt;ref name=chester/&gt; The glades of the Nashville Basin and Moulton Valley are considered a center endemism due to their large number of restricted species. Characteristic species of the Nashville Basin glades include Nashville glade cress (''[[Leavenworthia stylosa]]''), limestone fame-flower (''[[Phemeranthus calcaricus]]''), Nashville breadroot (''[[Pediomelum subacaule]]''), Gattinger's prairie clover (''[[Dalea gattingeri]]''), and Tennessee milk-vetch (''[[Astragalus tennesseensis]]''). Glades in other regions contain less endemism, and are characterized by species such as widow's-cross stonecrop (''[[Sedum pulchellum]]''), limestone skullcap (''[[Scutellaria parvula]]''), glade violet (''[[Viola egglestonii]]''), one-flower gladecress (''[[Leavenworthia uniflora]]''), and poverty dropseed (''[[Sporobolus vaginiflorus]]'').&lt;ref name= Jones/&gt; Glade remnants are common and well-preserved due to their undesirability for agriculture, and their largely edaphic nature. Many examples exist in [[Cedars of Lebanon State Park]], as well as numerous other natural areas.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Wetlands===
The Interior Low Plateau has an abundance of sinkhole ponds in the karst regions of the Mitchell Plain, Pennyroyal Plain, and Highland Rim. These isolated communities were historically found within a matrix of wet prairie. These communities are often covered in swamp forest, and are dominated by swamp cottonwood (''[[Populus heterophylla]]'') and red maple (''[[Acer rubrum]]''). High-quality herbaceous examples have species with coastal plain affinities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tn.gov/environment/article/na-na-morrison-meadow Morrison Meadow, Tennessee Natural Heritage Program]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these communities have been destroyed due to drainage for agriculture.&lt;ref name=chester/&gt;

Emergent shrub sloughs are found along the bottoms of major rivers, such as the Cumberland River and Tennessee River. These are dominated by buttonbush (''[[Cephalanthus occidentalis]]''), and along the Tennessee River contain bald-cypress (''[[Taxodium distichum]]''). These sloughs were historically widespread, but dam construction and agricultural activity have destroyed most of them.

A rare wetland type in this region is the calcareous seepage fen. These are found sparingly in the Highland Rim, and are dominated by grass of Parnassus (''[[Parnassia grandifolia]]'') and contain the federally-endangered Tennessee yellow-eyed grass (''[[Xyris tennesseensis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://explorer.natureserve.org/servlet/NatureServe?searchSystemUid=ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.723164 Interior Low Plateau Seepage Fen, NatureServe]&lt;/ref&gt; Calcareous seeps are also found near glades in the Inner Nashville Basin. These communities often have extensive stands of sunnybells (''[[Schoenolirion croceum]]'') and other rare species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tennessee.gov/environment/article/na-na-sunnybell-cedar-glade Sunnybell Cedar Glade State Natural Area, Tennessee Natural Heritage Program]&lt;/ref&gt; Calcareous seeps and swamp forest are also found sparingly in the Bluegrass region. These contain trees such as green ash (''[[Fraxinus pennsylvanica]]'') and swamp white oak (''[[Quercus bicolor]]''), along with many herbaceous plants that are considered regionally rare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluegrasswoodland.com/uploads/Bluegrass_Wetlands.pdf Native Wetlands of the Central Bluegrass Region: from seeps to streamheads to swamps to ponds, By Julian Campbell]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Fauna==
This region contains the richest diversity of freshwater animals in North America. In particular, the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]] in Tennessee is considered one of the top three most biologically rich rivers in the world, containing over 150 species of fish, 60 species of freshwater mussels, and 22 species of aquatic snails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/tennessee/placesweprotect/duck-river.xml] The Nature Conservancy&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Green River, Kentucky|Green River]] in this region also harbors diversity of a similar scale.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wku.edu/greenriver/ WKU Green River Preserve&lt;/ref&gt; This high amount of freshwater mussel diversity is due to the limestone bedrock underlying much of the region. The limestone creates calcareous water that acts as a buffer against acidity, which helps the mussels in shell-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haag |first=Wendell |date=2012 |title=North American Freshwater Mussels: Natural History, Ecology, and Conservation |url= |location= |publisher= |pages=102–103 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds of the woodlands include [[vireo]]s and [[tanager]]s while mammals include [[Eastern gray squirrel]]s, [[chipmunk]]s, [[raccoon]]s and [[opossum]]s.

== Threats ==
The dominance of oak in this part of the [[pre-Columbian savannas of North America]] was due to frequent fires.  The [[fire suppression]] policies since the 1930s have been a significant forest disturbance.&lt;ref name="Dey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/2065|title=Sustaining Oak Ecosystems in the Central Hardwood Region: Lessons from the Past--Continuing the History of Disturbance|last=Dey|first=Daniel C.|author2=Richard P. Guyette|year=2000|work=Trans. 65th No. Amer. Wildl. and Natur. Resour. Conf. p. 170-183|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there is very little intact habitat in this ecoregion, with a reduction of [[bottomland hardwood forest]]s by 70–95%, and only 0.02 percent of the original oak savannas remain.&lt;ref name=Dey /&gt;  Although much of the area is forested, these forests tend to be highly fragmented and significantly altered by development, agriculture, and fire suppression.  The forests are dominated primarily by oak and hickory species, but [[Secondary succession|succession]] has filled the understory with [[maple]]s and [[yellow poplar]] and blocking oak regeneration.&lt;ref name=Dey /&gt;  In some areas, habitat is threatened by urbanization and invasive species such as non-native [[privet]], [[honeysuckle]], [[garlic mustard]] and [[kudzu]].

==Protected Land==
Significant natural areas in the ecoregion include: Mammoth Cave National Park; the [[Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area]] of Tennessee and Kentucky; [[Hoosier National Forest]] and [[Yellowwood State Forest]] in southern [[Indiana]]; the [[Edge of Appalachia Preserve]] in [[Ohio]]; and the [[Shawnee Hills]] in southern [[Illinois]].

The '''International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation''' (IFNEC) formerly the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) began as a U.S. proposal, announced by [[United States Secretary of Energy]] [[Samuel Bodman]] on February 6, 2006, to form an international partnership to promote the use of [[nuclear power]] and close the [[nuclear fuel cycle]] in a way that reduces [[Radioactive waste|nuclear waste]] and the risk of [[nuclear proliferation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doe.gov/news/3161.htm Department of Energy Announces New Nuclear Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918013530/http://www.doe.gov/news/3161.htm |date=2008-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal would divide the world into "fuel supplier nations," which supply [[enriched uranium]] fuel and take back spent fuel, and "user nations," which operate nuclear power plants.

As GNEP the proposal proved controversial in the United States and internationally.  The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] provided far less funding for GNEP than [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] requested.  U.S. arms control organizations criticized the proposal to resume reprocessing as costly and increasing proliferation risks.  Some countries and analysts criticized the GNEP proposal for discriminating between countries as nuclear fuel cycle "haves" and "have-nots." In April 2009 the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] announced the cancellation of the U.S. domestic component of GNEP.&lt;ref name=NEI-20090415&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2052719|title=US GNEP programme dead, DOE confirms|date=15 April 2009|publisher=Nuclear Engineering International|accessdate=2009-07-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613090037/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2052719|archivedate=13 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the GNEP was renamed the International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation.  IFNEC is now an international partnership with 25 partner countries, 28 observer and candidate partner countries, and three international organization observers.&lt;ref name=IFNEC-website&gt;[http://www.ifnec.org/ International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt; The international organization observers are: the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], the [[Generation IV International Forum]], and the [[European Atomic Energy Community|European Commission]]. IFNEC operates by consensus among its partners based on an agreed GNEP Statement of Mission.&lt;ref name=GNEP-SOP&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ifnec.org/docs/IFNEC_StatementofMission.pdf|title=IFNEC Statement of Mission|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105050105/http://www.ifnec.org/docs/IFNEC_StatementofMission.pdf|archivedate=2010-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GNEP in the United States==
The GNEP proposal began as part of the Advanced Energy Initiative announced by [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] in his 2006 [[State of the Union address]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/01/20060131-6.html State of the Union: The Advanced Energy Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;

In announcing the GNEP Proposal, the U.S. Department of Energy said:

{{quote|The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership has four main goals.  First, reduce America's dependence on foreign sources of fossil fuels and encourage economic growth.  Second, recycle nuclear fuel using new proliferation-resistant technologies to recover more energy and reduce waste.  Third, encourage prosperity growth and clean development around the world. And fourth, utilize the latest technologies to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation worldwide.

Through GNEP, the United States will work with other nations possessing advanced nuclear technologies to develop new proliferation-resistant recycling technologies in order to produce more energy, reduce waste and minimize proliferation concerns. Additionally, &lt;nowiki&gt;[the]&lt;/nowiki&gt; partner nations will develop a fuel services program to provide nuclear fuel to developing nations allowing them to enjoy the benefits of abundant sources of clean, safe nuclear energy in a cost effective manner in exchange for their commitment to forgo enrichment and reprocessing activities, also alleviating proliferation concerns.}}

As a research and development program, GNEP is an outgrowth of the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.doe.gov/AFCI/neAFCI.html Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510084252/http://www.ne.doe.gov/AFCI/neAFCI.html |date=2012-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnep.energy.gov What is the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222213855/http://www.gnep.energy.gov/ |date=2006-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009 the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] announced the cancellation of the U.S. domestic component of GNEP,&lt;ref name=NEI-20090415 /&gt; and in June 2009 announced that it is no longer pursuing domestic commercial reprocessing and had largely halted the domestic GNEP programme. Research would continue on proliferation-resistant fuel cycles and waste management.&lt;ref name=NEI-20090701&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&amp;storyCode=2053466|title=GNEP is dead; long live Gen-4|date=1 July 2009|publisher=Nuclear Engineering International|accessdate=2009-07-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613104945/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&amp;storyCode=2053466|archivedate=13 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WNN-20090629&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-DoE_cancels_GNEP_EIS-2906095.html|title=Fatal blow to GNEP?|date=29 June 2009|publisher=[[World Nuclear News]]|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==
The United States has established a number of cooperative arrangements to pursue technical cooperation on this proposal.  On February 16, 2006 the United States, [[France]] and [[Japan]] signed an "arrangement" to research and develop [[Fast breeder reactor|sodium-cooled fast reactors]] in support of the GNEP.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.energy.gov/news/3218.htm |title=Generation IV International Forum Signs Agreement to Collaborate on Sodium Cooled Fast Reactors |date=February 17, 2006 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Energy]] |accessdate=2008-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420215727/http://www.energy.gov/news/3218.htm |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States has established "action plans" for collaboration with Russia, Japan and China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnep.energy.gov/afciparticipants/intlcollaboration.html International Collaboration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017091144/http://www.gnep.energy.gov/afciparticipants/intlcollaboration.html |date=2008-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2007, 16 countries officially became GNEP Partners by signing the GNEP Statement of Principles.&lt;ref name=GNEP-SOP /&gt; These countries were:
*Australia
*Bulgaria
*China
*France
*Ghana
*Hungary
*Japan
*Jordan
*Kazakhstan
*Lithuania
*Poland
*Romania
*Russia
*Slovenia
*Ukraine
*United States

Since then, nine additional countries have joined:

*Republic of Korea
*Morocco
*Oman
*Senegal
*United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/nuclearPolicies/Membership_of_GNEP_has_tripled_170907.shtml |title=Membership of GNEP has tripled|date=17 September 2007|publisher=World Nuclear News|accessdate=2007-10-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071004152158/http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/nuclearPolicies/Membership_of_GNEP_has_tripled_170907.shtml |archivedate = 2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.energy.gov/print/5497.htm|title=Global Nuclear Energy Partnership Triples in Size to 16 Members|date=September 16, 2007|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventeen countries have been invited to join GNEP as partners but have not been willing to sign the Statement of Principles and have participated as observers. These include South Africa, although South African Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica stated that "Exporting uranium only to get it back refined, instead of enriching it in South Africa, would be 'in conflict with our national policy.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iVN6X3NLfzljt66R_ThfRyFl6R2Q|title=SAfrica out of GNEP to keep right to enrich uranium: minister|date=September 18, 2007|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|accessdate=2007-10-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008200047/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iVN6X3NLfzljt66R_ThfRyFl6R2Q|archivedate=October 8, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25 additional countries have been invited to join GNEP at the October 1, 2008 GNEP Ministerial in Paris, France.&lt;ref name=GNEP-website&gt;[http://www.gneppartnership.org Global Nuclear Energy Partnership website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2007 a large number of U.S. nuclear arms control organizations sent a joint letter to [[United States Congress|Congress]] requesting that GNEP funding be terminated on the grounds that it undermined U.S. nuclear proliferation policy, would cost over $100 billion, and did not solve the [[Radioactive waste|nuclear waste]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/global_security/Community-letter-GNEP-Congress_Final.pdf |title=Letter to Senators Byron L. Dorgan and Pete V. Domenici (Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, Senate Appropriations Committee)|date=October 31, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071204211549/http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/global_security/Community-letter-GNEP-Congress_Final.pdf |archivedate = 2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 [[United States Congress|Congress]] allocated less than half of the requested funds, supporting GNEP research but not technology demonstration projects. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] assessed that reprocessing spent nuclear fuel would cost considerably more than disposal in a long-term repository.&lt;ref name=wmdinsights&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.wmdinsights.com/I23/I23_G2_GlobalNuclearEnergy.htm|title=Global Nuclear Energy Partnership: Progress, Problems, and Prospects|author=Richard Weitz|publisher=WMD Insights|date=March 2008|accessdate=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states do not approve of the GNEP philosophy that partitions the world between a few fuel-cycle states and a larger number of receiver states, reflecting the distinctions in the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].&lt;ref name=NAM-1998&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nam.gov.za/xiisummit/|title=Durban Final Document|author=Heads of State, Non-Aligned Countries|date=2–3 September 1998|publisher=[[Non-Aligned Movement]]|page=para. 120|accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are concerned that their nuclear fuel assurance could in the future be subject to external political pressure.&lt;ref name="sean-lucas -200411"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_58a.html|title=The Bush Proposals: A Global Strategy for Combating the Spread of Nuclear Weapons Technology or a Sanctioned Nuclear Cartel?|author=Sean Lucas|date=November 2004|publisher=[[Center for Nonproliferation Studies]]|accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe it creates an unfortunate incentive on states to develop enrichment or reprocessing technology now, to position themselves to become one of the future fuel-cycle states.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ostina.org/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=1677|title=Proposals to Strengthen the Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime|author=Harold D. Bengelsdorf|date=December 2006|publisher=Office of Science &amp; Technology|accessdate=2007-10-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716072559/http://www.ostina.org/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=1677|archivedate=2011-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Kidd, Head of Strategy &amp; Research at the [[World Nuclear Association]], has explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An alternative view of GNEP may see it as somewhat discriminatory and potentially anti-competitive. By restricting parts of the fuel cycle to particular countries, albeit with fair rights of access to nuclear materials, there is a risk of maintaining or even reinforcing the existing NPT arrangements that have always upset certain nations, notably India and Pakistan. Similarly, by maintaining a market stranglehold on, for example, enrichment facilities in the existing countries, it can be argued that the market will be uncompetitive and lead to excessive profits being achieved by those who are so favoured.&lt;ref name=NEI-20060601&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2036516|title=GNEP: the right way forward?|author=Steve Kidd|date=1 June 2006|publisher=Nuclear Engineering International|accessdate=2008-08-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127032251/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2036516|archivedate=27 November 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another criticism is that GNEP seeks to deploy proliferation-prone reprocessing technology for commercial reasons, and to bypass the continued delays with the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]], while erroneously claiming to enhance global nuclear security.&lt;ref name=NEI-20070914&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&amp;storyCode=2047064|title=Evolving international pacts for tomorrow|author=Steve Kidd|date=14 September 2007|publisher=Nuclear Engineering International|accessdate=2007-10-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613102708/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&amp;storyCode=2047064|archivedate=13 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In geology, '''lake capture''' is the process of capture (see [[Stream capture]]) of the waters collected in a lake by a neighbor river basin.

The occurrence of a lake capture is mainly controlled by the water balance at the lake's basin and the changes in topography due to erosion, sedimentation, and tectonism.&lt;ref name=GSA2006&gt;Garcia-Castellanos, D., 2006. Long-term evolution of tectonic lakes: Climatic controls on the development of internally drained basins. In: Tectonics, Climate, and Landscape evolution. Eds.: S.D. Willett, N. Hovius, M.T. Brandon &amp; D.M. Fisher. GSA Special Paper 398. 283-294. doi:10.1130/2006.2398(17)  [https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B_xuyENh5ksFZmM3ODM1ZmItMDdlNy00NWY2LThjZWEtMTYxMjNhMTJkY2Fm&amp;export=download&amp;hl=en pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; If evaporation at the surface of a lake, plus the water losses through underground infiltration and plant evapotranspiration are high enough to account for all precipitation water collected by the lake, then the lake becomes [[endorheic]], closed, or internally drained. This situation prevails until the water balance changes again and the lake overburdens the limits of its basin or until the lake capture occurs. Opening the drainage of an [[endorheic]] lacustrine basin by fluvial erosion generally implies a lake capture.

Lake captures are therefore very sensitive to the preexisting topography as well as to climatic and lithological factors. A climatic change towards more humid conditions can result in a higher water level in the internally drained basin, eventually causing overflow, this . In a longer time-scale, sediment colmatation of the lacustrine basin can also lead to overflow. Both can hinder the relative importance of the capture process carried out by erosion.

Examples include the Late Neogen capture of the [[endorheic]] [[Geology of the Iberian Peninsula#Ebro Basin|Ebro Basin]] (capture) or the Pleistocene [[Lake Bonneville]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4220">A '''''lapis manalis''''' ([[Latin]]: "stone of the [[Manes]]"{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}) was either of two sacred stones used in the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]].  One covered a gate to [[Hades]], abode of the dead; Festus called it ''ostium Orci'', "the gate of [[Orcus]]".  The other was used to make rain; this one may have no direct relationship with the ''Manes'', but is instead derived from the verb ''manare'', "to flow".  

The two stones had the same name.  However, the grammarian [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] held the cover to the gate of the underworld and the rainmaking stone to be two distinct stones.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Pompeius Festus, ''[http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/erudits/Festus/m.htm De verborum significatione]'', sub. tit. ''manalis'' (Latin and French text)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gate to the underworld==
{{See also|Mundus cerialis}}
[[Image:UmbilicusUrbi.jpg|thumb|[[Plutarch]] linked the Roman ''mundus'' to the religious center of the city of Rome, the ''[[umbilicus urbis Romae]]''.]]
One such stone covered the '''''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#mundus|mundus]] [[Ceres (mythology)|Cereris]]''''', a pit thought to contain an entrance to the [[underworld]].  Most cities of [[Latium]] and [[Etruria]] contained a similar pit or ditch; [[Plutarch]] describes the custom of a ''mundus'' as being of [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] origin, and states that it was used as a place where first-fruits were deposited.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Romulus*.html#11 Life of Romulus]'' ch. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Latin word ''mundus'' meant "[[world]]".  Festus, quoting [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] this time, explains that:

:''Mundo nomen impositum est ab eo mundo qui supra nos est.''
::(The ''mundus'' gets its name from that world which is above us.)&lt;ref&gt;W. Warde Fowler, "[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/JRS/2/Mundus*.html Mundus Patet]", ''Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 2 (1912), pp 25‑33.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Roman ''mundus'' was located in the [[Comitium]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, supra.&lt;/ref&gt;  This stone was ceremonially opened three times a year, during which   spirits of the blessed dead (the ''Manes'') were able to commune with the living.  The three days upon which the ''mundus'' was opened were August 24, October 5, and November 8.  Fruits of the harvest were offered to the dead at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Adkins and Roy A. Adkins, ''Dictionary of Roman Religion'' (Facts on File, 1996) {{ISBN|0-8160-3005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, above&lt;/ref&gt; [[Macrobius]], quoting [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], says of these days that: 

:''Mundus cum patet, deorum tristium atque inferum quasi ianua patet.''
::("When the ''mundus'' is open, it is as if a door stands open for the sorrowful [[di inferi|gods of the underworld]].")

Accordingly, he reports that military and public matters were not transacted upon them, even though they were not ''[[nefasti|dies nefasti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#16.18 Saturnalia]'' I 16.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charm to make rain==
The other was used as part of a ceremony called the '''''aquaelicium''''' (Latin: "calling the waters") which sought to produce [[rain]] in times of [[drought]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[James Frazer]], ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' ch. 5, "[[s:The Golden Bough/The Magical Control of the Weather|Magical Control of the Weather]]" (Abridged edition, MacMillan, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt; During the ceremony, the ''[[pontifex|pontifices]]'' had the stone brought from its usual resting place, a temple of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] near the [[Porta Capena]], into the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].  Offerings were made to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] petitioning for rain, and water was ceremonially poured over the stone.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Bailey, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18564/18564-8.txt The Religion of Ancient Rome]'', ch. 2 (Archibald, Constable &amp; Co., London, 1907)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Leap Manifesto''' is a political [[manifesto]] issued by a broad coalition of [[Canadians|Canadian]] authors, artists, national leaders and activists in September 2015, during the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|Canadian federal election campaign]]. Initial signatories to the Manifesto include actors [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Rachel McAdams]], [[Ellen Page]], [[Sarah Polley]], and documentary filmmaker [[Avi Lewis]];  musicians [[Neil Young]], [[Leonard Cohen]], and [[Alanis Morissette]]; and writers [[William Gibson]], [[Naomi Klein]] and [[Michael Ondaatje]], along with environmental groups and labour union members including former [[Canadian Union of Public Employees]] president [[Paul Moist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/canada-leap-manifesto-fossil-fuels-naomi-klein |title = Canadian activists and artists back Leap Manifesto's call to end fossil fuel use |first = Jessica |last = Murphy |date = 15 September 2015 |newspaper = [[The Guardian]] |language = en-GB |issn = 0261-3077 |access-date = 16 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The document calls for a restructuring of the Canadian economy and an end to the use of fossil fuels. A resolution referring the manifesto to local riding associations for discussion was approved by delegates during the 2016 [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP) Convention.&lt;ref name="globe-and-mail"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/leap-manifesto-what-is-it-and-what-could-it-mean-for-the-ndpsfuture/article29583796/ |title = The Leap Manifesto: What is it, and what could it mean for the NDP’s future? |first1 = Justin |last1 = Giovannetti |first2 = Laura |last2 = Stone |first3 = Evan |last3 = Annett |date = 11 April 2016 |newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political involvement ==

Although those behind the leap manifesto identify as non-partisan,&lt;ref name="eve"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/new-democrats-hear-leap-manifesto-push-on-eve-of-convention |title = New Democrats hear Leap Manifesto push on eve of convention |first = Lee |last = Berthiaume |date = 15 February 2018 |newspaper = [[National Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; they have intentionally presented the manifesto to the NDP at key times.  The Leap Manifesto was first presented in September 2015 during the Canadian federal election campaign, when then NDP leader Tom Mulcair was praising the party as moderate.&lt;ref name="globe-and-mail"/&gt; Leap advocates again pressed the NDP to adopt the manifesto principles at the NDP biennial policy convention held in Edmonton in April 2016, following the loss of the 2015 federal election. This has proven to divide members of the NDP party, with much controversy surrounding the Leap’s perspective towards pipelines and resource extraction energy projects.&lt;ref name="globe-and-mail"/&gt; In February 2018, on the night before the biennial NDP policy convention, Leap supporters held a conference to once again urge the NDP to embrace and support the manifesto principles. In the convention, the party remained divided regarding adopting the manifesto as party policy.&lt;ref name="eve"/&gt;

== Criticisms ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}{{Original research section|date=May 2018}}

There are several criticisms about the Leap Manifesto. First, although the Leap Manifesto is heavily focused on climate change and the importance of moving away from a fossil fuel-dependent economy, there is very little in the document detailing how to transition to a green economy. The document suggests that new jobs will be created in the caregiving sector, although it is argued{{by whom|date=June 2018}} this isn’t plausible for many small communities.

Another concern is that the Manifesto is expensive. With a goal of a "100% Clean Economy by 2050", the amount of technology needing to be installed and the attached prices are high. The Manifesto provides a document by Dr. Jacobson titled ‘[http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/CountriesWWS.pdf 100% Clean and Renewable Wind, Water, and Sunlight (WWS) All-Sector Energy Roadmaps for 139 Countries of the World]’ to support its cause. The implementation of renewable energy systems is a lengthy and expensive process, which is argued{{by whom|date=June 2018}} to be unachievable.

Another criticism{{by whom|date=June 2018}} is that there are many questions attached to the manifesto, yet there are not as many answers. The manifesto is much harder on resource extraction than it is on the inequalities brought about by a capitalist system. The manifesto mentions new jobs produced in caregiving sectors, although this may not be suitable for all communities across Canada.{{according to who|date=June 2018}} Former New Democrat and co-founder of [[The Waffle]], [[James Laxer]], described the manifesto as "a document for elites and not the majority of Canadians" due to its focus on divestment from resource extraction rather than addressing wage and wealth inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.macleans.ca/politics/why-leap-isnt-a-manifesto-for-the-people/ |title=Why Leap isn’t a manifesto for the people |first=James |last=Laxer |journal=[[Maclean's]] |date=13 April 2016 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indonesian faunal emblems''' are [[Fauna of Indonesia|Indonesian endemic fauna]] that gain the status as national animal symbol that represent [[Indonesia]] and describe Indonesian [[biodiversity]]. Today there are three animals that gained the status as Indonesian faunal emblems: [[Komodo dragon]], [[Javan hawk-eagle]] and  [[Asian arowana]]. Next to national animal symbols, there are also more specific [[Provinces of Indonesia|provincial]] faunal emblems that represent each respective [[provinces of Indonesia]].

==Indonesian national faunal emblems==
''Komodo'' is an Indonesian [[endemic]] animal found only in [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]], [[Padar (island)|Padar]] and [[Rinca]] island within [[Komodo National Park]]. The surviving largest lizard on earth is easily recognised as Indonesian national animal. Komodo also become the emblem of [[East Nusa Tenggara]] province.

''Elang Jawa'' or [[Javan hawk-eagle]] (''Nisaetus bartelsi'') an endangered [[Bird of prey|raptor]] endemic to the mountainous forest regions of [[Java]]. The Javan hawk-eagle was chosen because its resemblance to the [[Garuda Pancasila]], the most obvious physical traits is the prominent [[Crest (feathers)|crest]] crowning its head and the plumage coloured dark-brownish to chestnut-gold. By Presidential decree, the Javan hawk-eagle was legally registered as considered as the national bird of Indonesia, and thus attributing the endangered species very high protection.&lt;ref name="Keppres No.4/1993"&gt; Keputusan Presiden No. 4/1993, issued on 10 January 1993, the status of ''Elang Jawa'' (Javan hawk-eagle) as the national bird of Indonesia (Widyastuti 1993, Sözer et al. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both ''arwana merah'' (super red [[Asian arowana]]) and ''arwana emas'' (golden Asian arowana) are designated as Indonesian national animal of charm and also national fish. These fish are endemic in rivers of Sumatra and Indonesian Borneo. Both species of ''Scleropages aureus'' (red-tailed golden arowana) is native to northern Sumatra, while the ''Scleropages legendrei'' (super red arowana) is native to [[Kapuas River|Kapuas]] river and nearby lakes in [[West Kalimantan]].

This is a '''list of wild forests''' in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Lands designated as "[[Forest Preserve (New York)#Wild forest|wild forest]]" in New York are managed by the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] as part of the [[Forest Preserve (New York)|Forest Preserve]].

==Management==
Wild forests are intended to retain an essentially wild and natural character, however management facilitates a greater amount of recreational use than areas designated by the state as [[wilderness]], which feature an increased sense of remoteness and solitude.&lt;ref name=StateLandClass&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/7811.html |title=State Land Classifications |publisher=NYS Department of Environmental Conservation |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are located within the boundaries of [[Adirondack Park]] or [[Catskill Park]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5516">'''Louise Beebe Wilder''' (1878–1938) was an American gardening writer whose books are now considered classics of their era.

==Biography==
Louise Beebe was born to a well-to-do family in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1878. She showed an early interest in gardening.&lt;ref name=robbins/&gt; 

In 1902, she married architect Walter Robb Wilder, and the couple moved to [[Pomona, New York]],&lt;ref name=hort/&gt; where she transformed the rural property (known as Balderbrae),&lt;ref name=balderbrae/&gt; adding pathways, a pair of half-moon fountains, a grape arbor, terraces, flowering trees, a walled garden, and an herb bed.&lt;ref name=robbins/&gt; Later, they moved a bit further south to the village of [[Bronxville, New York|Bronxville]], where she designed Station Plaza and founded a local Working Gardeners Club (1925).&lt;ref name=robbins/&gt; She designed residential gardens across the county; her philosophy, influenced by the aesthetic of British gardener [[Gertrude Jekyll]],&lt;ref name=tankard/&gt; was to create something "formal in design but most informal in execution".&lt;ref name=robbins/&gt;

Wilder wrote ten books about her experiences as a gardener that were popular for offering clear, explicit advice rather than flowery nature writing.&lt;ref name=robbins/&gt; She also wrote for newspapers and gardening and shelter magazines such as  ''Horticulture'', ''House &amp; Garden'', and the ''New York Times''.&lt;ref name=robbins/&gt; In particular, she took up the challenge of adapting Jekyll's aesthetic—developed for a substantially different climate and range of plant species—to the needs of American gardeners.&lt;ref name=tankard/&gt; The title of her second book, ''Colour in My Garden'', deliberately echoes Jekyll's influential 1908 book ''Colour in the Flower Garden''.

Wilder's "socio-botanical commentaries"—as author [[Michael Pollan]] termed them&lt;ref name=pollan/&gt;—captured the spirit of a moment in America when suburban gardening and its attendant forms of landscape design were on the rise and an older, more formal style of large estate garden was in decline. A ''New York Times'' editor called her a Romantic, but one "with a strong vein of scientific curiosity that she exercised on a domestic scale.”&lt;ref name=robbins/&gt; Another ''New York Times'' editor, after noting that she was conversant with both classic British and recent American horticultural literature, praised her for the sharpness of her field observations.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; Her books—especially ''Colour in My Garden''—are now considered classics,&lt;ref name=tankard/&gt; and in 2001 some were reissued as a four-volume collection, ''The Louise Beebe Wilder Gardener’s Library: Four Classic Books by America’s Greatest Garden Writer''.&lt;ref name=robbins/&gt;

Wilder also served on the board of the New York Botanical Garden.&lt;ref name=hort/&gt; 

She was honored with the [[Garden Club of America]]'s Gold Medal for Horticultural Achievement in 1937.&lt;ref name=robbins/&gt;
 
Walter committed suicide in 1934, and Wilder herself died April 20, 1938.&lt;ref name=robbins/&gt;

== History ==
Nappes or nappe belts are a major feature of the [[Europe]]an [[Geology of the Alps|Alps]], [[Carpathians]] and [[Stara planina|Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmid, S. M., Fügenschuh, B., Kissling, E, and Schuster, R. 2004: [http://pages.unibas.ch/earth/tecto/research/Schmid_et_al_2004_Ecl.pdf ''Tectonic Map and Overall Architecture of the Alpine Orogen.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128152822/http://pages.unibas.ch/earth/tecto/research/Schmid_et_al_2004_Ecl.pdf |date=2006-11-28 }} ''Eclogae geologicae Helvetiae'' v. 97, Basel: Birkhäuser Verlag, pp. 93–117, ISSN 0012-9402&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gamkrelidze, I.P. 1991: ''Tectonic nappes and horizontal layering of the Earth’s crust in the Mediterranean belt (Carpathians, Balkanides and Caucasus).'' Tectonophysics, 196, p. 385-396&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century many geologists have uncovered areas with large-scale overthrusts. Some of these were substantiated with [[paleontology|paleontological]] evidence. The concept was developed by [[Marcel Alexandre Bertrand]], who unraveled the complex [[tectonic]] history of the Alps and identified the feature as ''nappe de charriage''. He reinterpreted earlier studies by [[Arnold Escher von der Linth]] and [[Albert Heim]] in the [[Glarus Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;Franks, S., Trümpy, R., 2005: ''The Sixth International Geological Congress: Zürich, 1894.'' Episodes, vol. 28, 3, p. 187-192&lt;/ref&gt; His work in [[Switzerland]] influenced Escher and [[Maurice Lugeon]]. Several years later, nappe structure was investigated in northwestern [[Scotland]] by [[Charles Lapworth]]. Lugeon later transferred the ideas of nappes to the [[Carpathians]].

== Structure ==
[[Image:Vápeč od Horní Poruby.jpg|thumb|right|Klippe of [[Hronicum|Hronicum nappe]], [[Vápeč]], [[Strážovské vrchy|Strážovské vrchy Mts.]], Slovakia]]
''Nappe'' can be qualified in a number of ways to indicate various features of a formation. The frontal part in the direction of movement, is called ''the leading edge'' of a nappe; numerous [[Fold (geology)|folds]] and secondary [[Thrust fault|thrusts]] and [[duplex (geology)|duplexes]] are common features here and are sometimes called ''digitations''. The surface of a [[thrust fault]] which caused movement of a nappe is called a ''[[decollement]]'', ''detachment plane'' or sole of thrust. The ''root area'' is an area where the nappe is completely separated from its substratum. It is often compressed and reduced, even underthrust below the surrounding tectonic units, resulting in a specific structure called a ''[[Suture (geology)|suture]]''. A nappe whose root area is unknown, is called a ''rootless nappe''.

Areas with a nappe structure often contain two types of geological features:

* A ''nappe outlier'' or ''[[klippe]]'' is a small area isolated from the main body of the nappe by [[erosion]] that lies on the autochthonous base; the summit of [[Veľký Rozsutec]] in the [[Western Carpathians]] is a typical example.
* A ''fault inlier'', ''fenster'', or '''[[Window (geology)|window]]''' is an area of the autochthonous basement uncovered by erosion, but entirely surrounded by the body of the nappe; the [[Hohe Tauern window]] in the Alps is a typical example.

== Classification ==
According to petrographical composition, two basic types of nappes are known:

* [[Basement nappe]]s are composed generally of [[Basement (geology)|crystalline basement]] rocks (but may contain basement sedimentary cover), forming so-called [[thick-skinned deformation|thick-skinned style]]. Nappes of this type usually reach a large thickness and form independent superunits such as [[Penninic nappes]].
* [[Cover nappe]]s or so called ''superficial nappes'' are composed generally of [[sedimentary rock]]s that form the upper part of [[Earth crust|crust]], forming so-called [[thin-skinned deformation|thin-skinned style]]. Therefore, nappes of this type form smaller units, such as the [[Hallstatt nappe]] in the [[Austroalpine nappes]] of the Alps.

== Mechanisms of emplacement ==
[[File:Orogenic wedge.jpg|thumb|right|Converging tectonic plates and the orogenic wedge]]
Nappes are generally considered as [[Thrust tectonics|compressional]] structures, however some exceptions could be found especially among the gravitational slides along low angle faults.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R.H. (1979) "Gravity sliding in the Maritime Alps" pp. 335&amp;ndash;352 ''In'' McClay, K. R. and Price, N.J. (editors) (1981) ''Thrust and Nappe Tectonics'' (Geological Society of London Special Publication 9) Blackwell Scientific, Oxford, England, {{ISBN|978-0-632-00614-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Park, R. G.|origyear=1997|year=2004|title=Foundations of Structural Geology|edition=third|type=reprint of 1997 edition of Chapman &amp; Hall|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Abingdon, England|pages= 131–132|ISBN=978-0-7487-5802-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravitational forces could be even important in certain cases during emplacement of compressional thrusts. The movement of huge masses of rock may be influenced by several forces, forces that may act together or sequentially.

At shallower depths, low [[pressure]]s and [[temperature]]s can't cause the [[plastic]] and [[viscous]] behavior of solid [[Rock (geology)|rock]] necessary to move along low angle faults. It is considered that such characteristics may be achieved at significantly less extreme conditions in the [[clay]]ey rocks or [[evaporites]], which can then act as tectonic [[lubricant]]s. The process, which significantly reduces the [[friction]]al resistance, is the fluid overpressure, which acts against the normal pressure, thereby reducing high lithostatic pressures and allowing [[fracturation]], [[cataclasis]] and formation of [[Fault breccia|tectonic breccia]] or [[fault gouge]] that could act as a [[decollement]] plane. Evaporites are also often related the decollement and thrust planes. Evaporites are strongly prone to [[Shear (geology)|shear deformation]] and therefore preferred planes of detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, D.M., Engelder, T., 1985: ''The role of salt in fold-and-thrust belts.'' Tectonophysics, 119, p. 67-88&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavior of [[Thrust fault|thrust]] sheets is currently explained on the model of the [[orogenic wedge]], which is dependent on the internal wedge taper θ.&lt;ref&gt;Nemčok, M., Schamel, S., Gayer, R. A., 2005: ''Thrustbelts: structural architecture, thermal regimes and petroleum systems.'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 554 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Gravitational sliding is movement generated by the movement down an inclined plane under the action of [[gravity]]. Gravitational spreading, possibly accompanied by an initial phase of [[diapirism]], is generated by large heat flow that causes detachment in a hinterland.&lt;ref&gt;Price, N.J., McClay, K.R., 1981: [http://sp.lyellcollection.org/cgi/reprint/9/1/1 ''Introduction.''] p. 1-5 in Price, N.J., McClay, K.R. (Eds.), ''Thrust and Nappe Tectonics.'' Geological Society, Special Publications vol. 9, London, 528 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Other mechanisms, such as push from behind, action of tangential compressive forces, and shortening of the basement, are essentially variations of the previous mechanisms.

'''Ocean zoning''' is a policy approach for [[environmental resource management]] in [[ocean]]ic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ocean Zoning Factsheet|url = http://waittinstitute.org/oceanzoning/|accessdate = 2015-06-08|first = |last = |publisher = Waitt Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, often big picture, approach to ocean management allocates areas for various ocean uses. Types of zones can include areas designated for [[marine protected areas]] (including [[marine reserve]]s), [[aquaculture]], various types of fishing, shipping, recreation (including [[scuba diving]]), mooring/anchoring, and energy production (including [[offshore wind power]]). The process of [[Marine Spatial Planning|marine spatial planning]] can result in ocean zones being legally established.

Benefits of ocean zoning can include reducing conflict between users, safeguarding ecologically important areas, enabling commercial activity to develop with certainty, and supporting international cooperation. A key challenge of ocean zoning is balancing environmental, economic, security, social, and cultural interests in delineation of zone boundaries.

'''Oceanus Procellarum''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|s|iː|ə|n|ə|s|_|ˌ|p|r|ɒ|s|ᵻ|ˈ|l|eɪ|r|ə|m}}; [[Latin]] for "'''Ocean of Storms'''") is a vast [[lunar mare]] on the western edge of the [[near side of the Moon|near side]] of the [[Moon]]. It is the only one of the lunar maria to be called an "Oceanus" (ocean), due to its size: Oceanus Procellarum is the largest of the maria, stretching more than {{convert|2500|km|abbr=on}} across its north-south axis and covering roughly {{convert|4000000|km²|abbr=on}}.

==Characteristics==
Like all lunar maria, Oceanus Procellarum was formed by ancient [[basalt]]ic flood [[volcano|volcanic]] eruptions that covered the region in a thick, nearly flat layer of solidified [[magma]]. Unlike the other lunar maria, however, Oceanus Procellarum may or may not be contained within a single well-defined impact basin. Around its edges lie many minor bays and seas, including [[Mare Nubium]] and [[Mare Humorum]] to the south. To the northeast, Oceanus Procellarum is separated from [[Mare Imbrium]] by the [[Montes Carpatus|Carpathian Mountains]]. On its north-west edge lies the 32&amp;nbsp;km wide [[Aristarchus (crater)|Aristarchus ray crater]], which is considered as the brightest feature on the Near side of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;DK Space Encyclopedia: The Near Side of the Moon&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the more-prominent ray-crater [[Copernicus (lunar crater)|Copernicus]] lies within the eastern edge of the mare, distinctly with its bright ray materials sprawling over the darker material. On the northern edge of Oceanus Procellarum lies [[Sinus Roris]].

==Origin==

[[File:Procellarum Rifts.tif|thumb|Gravity anomalies (red) bordering the Procellarum region overlaid on a global elevation map.]]

There are several hypotheses about the origin of Oceanus Procellarum and a related asymmetry between the near and far sides of the Moon. One of the most likely is that Procellarum was a result of an ancient giant impact on the near side of the Moon. The size of the impact basin has been estimated to be more than 3,000 kilometers, which would make it [[List of largest craters in the Solar System|one of the largest craters in the Solar System]]. 
[[File:Apollo 12 landing site 3154 h2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Image of [[Apollo 12]] landing site (center) used in mission planning (1.75 x 1.75 km).]] 
The impact likely happened very early in the Moon's history: at the time when [[Lunar magma ocean|magma ocean]] still existed or just ceased to exist. It deposited 5–30&amp;nbsp;km of crustal material on the far side forming highlands. If this is the case, all impact related structures such as crater [[Impact crater|rim]], central peak etc. have been obliterated by later impacts and [[volcanism]]. One piece of evidence in support of this hypothesis is concentration of incompatible elements ([[KREEP]]) and low calcium [[pyroxene]] around Oceanus Procellarum.&lt;ref name=Nakamura2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nakamura | first1 = R. | last2 = Yamamoto | first2 = S. | last3 = Matsunaga | first3 = T. | last4 = Ishihara | first4 = Y. | last5 = Morota | first5 = T. | last6 = Hiroi | first6 = T. | last7 = Takeda | first7 = H. | last8 = Ogawa | first8 = Y. | last9 = Yokota | first9 = Y. | last10 = Hirata | doi = 10.1038/NGEO1614 | first10 = N. | last11 = Ohtake | first11 = M. | last12 = Saiki | first12 = K. | title = Compositional evidence for an impact origin of the Moon's Procellarum basin | journal = Nature Geoscience | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 775 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..775N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Byrne2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Byrne | first1 = C.

Procellarum may have also been formed by spatially inhomogeneous heating during the Moon's formation.&lt;ref name=Nakamura2012/&gt; The GRAIL mission, which mapped the gravity gradients of the moon, found square formations resembling rift valleys surrounding the region beneath the lava plains, suggesting the basin was formed by heating and cooling of the lunar surface by internal processes rather than by an impact, which would have left a round crater.&lt;ref name=NASA2014&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=NASA Mission Points to Origin of "Ocean of Storms" on Earth’s Moon |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/october/nasa-mission-points-to-origin-of-ocean-of-storms-on-earth-s-moon |agency=NASA |date=2014-10-01 |accessdate=2014-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other hypotheses include a late accretion of a companion Moon on the far side. The latter postulates that in addition to the present Moon, another smaller (about 1,200&amp;nbsp;km in diameter) moon was formed from debris of the [[giant impact hypothesis|giant impact]]. After a few tens of millions of years it collided with the Moon and due to a small collisional velocity simply piled up on one side of the Moon forming what is now known as far side [[Lunar highlands|highlands]].&lt;ref name=Jutzi2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jutzi | first1 = M. | last2 = Asphaug | first2 = E. | doi = 10.1038/nature10289 | title = Forming the lunar farside highlands by accretion of a companion moon | journal = Nature | volume = 476 | issue = 7358 | pages = 69–72 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21814278| pmc = | bibcode = 2011Natur.476...69J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration==
The [[robotic spacecraft|robotic]] lunar [[space probe|probes]] [[Luna 9]], [[Luna 13]], [[Surveyor 1]] and [[Surveyor 3]] landed in Oceanus Procellarum.  Luna 9 landed southwest of [[Galilaei (lunar crater)|Galilaei]] crater in 1966.  Luna 13 landed southeast of [[Seleucus (crater)|Seleucus]] crater, later in 1966.  Surveyor 1 landed north of [[Flamsteed (crater)|Flamsteed]] crater (within the larger Flamsteed P) in 1966, and Surveyor 3 landed in 1967.  

During the Apollo program, flight operations planners were concerned about having the optimum lighting conditions at the landing site, hence the alternative target sites moved progressively westward, following the terminator. A delay of two days for weather or equipment reasons would have sent Apollo 11 to [[Sinus Medii]] (designated ALS3) instead of ALS2—[[Mare Tranquillitatis]]; another two-day delay would have resulted in ALS5, a site in Oceanus Procellarum, being targeted.

The manned [[Apollo 12]] mission landed in Oceanus Procellarum, with [[astronaut]]s [[Pete Conrad]] and [[Alan Bean]] on board. Their landing site, within {{convert|300|m|ft|sp=us}} of Surveyor 3, has become known as [[Mare Cognitum]].

'''Oil production and smuggling''' was the major revenue maker for the self-declared state of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL/ISIS),&lt;ref name=cosgrove/&gt;&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; its product being termed "the 'black gold' feeding the 'black flag'".&lt;ref name=solomon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/b8234932-719b-11e5-ad6d-f4ed76f0900a.html#axzz3rhwAkkfP|author1=Erika Solomon |author2=Guy Chazan |author3=Sam Jones |title=Isis Inc: how oil fuels the jihadi terrorists| publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=14 October 2015 |accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil extracted from fields controlled by ISIL( '''Islamic State Of Iraq And The Levant''' ) in Syria and Iraq were mainly distributed within most its territory, but also smuggled to surrounding states at below market prices.

While oil products, [[petrol]] and [[mazout]], were the backbone of the economy of ISIL-controlled areas with mazout being the power source for generators for electricity,&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; not all energy production was provided by oil. [[Hydroelectric power plant]]s had been captured in northern Syria, so the [[Tabqa Dam]], the [[Baath Dam]], and, from 2012-2015, the [[Tishrin Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powerengineeringint.com/articles/print/volume-22/issue-8/features/iraq-s-electricity-from-crisis-to-isis.html |author=Harry Istepanian|title=Iraq's electricity: from crisis to ISIS| publisher=Power Engineering International |date=22 September 2014 |accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some electric power has been sold back to the Syrian government.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Max|title=How ISIS is exploiting the economics of Syria's civil war|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/6/12/5802824/how-isis-is-exploiting-the-economics-of-syrias-civil-war|date=12 June 2014|website=Vox|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian government was also reported to send technicians to support and maintain  ISIL-controlled gas power plants, and, in return, received electricity.&lt;ref name=dm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3324789/Russia-hits-ISIS-hurts-Raids-target-oil-trucks-Syria.html| author=Keiligh Baker |title=Putin hits ISIS where it hurts: Russia hits more than 200 targets in 24 hours as Moscow aims to cut off jihadists' income by taking out refinery and oil trucks| publisher=Daily Mail| date=19 November 2015 |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil production within ISIL developed over time reaching a peak by 2014.&lt;ref name=mckay&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/11/isis-still-stealing-spilling-and-smuggling-oil-throughout-iraq.html| author=Hollie McKay |title=ISIS still stealing, spilling and smuggling oil throughout Iraq |publisher=Fox News| date=September 11, 2017 |accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[Military intervention against ISIL|military interventions]], ISIL subsequently lost much of its territory to continue oil production on a larger scale in Syria and Iraq, yet continues to produce oil from those oil fields it controls.&lt;ref name=mckay/&gt;

== Oil as a source of revenue for ISIL ==
Estimates of the income ISIL derived from its oil operations vary. In 2014, Dubai-based energy analysts put the combined oil revenue from ISIL's Iraqi-Syrian production as high as US$3 million per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.com/International/story?id=24814359|title=ISIS Makes Up To $3 Million a Day Selling Oil, Say Analysts|date=2 August 2014|accessdate=8 October 2014|publisher=ABC news|author=Karen Leigh}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimate from October 2015 indicated the production to be about 34,000-40,000 bpd that was sold at US$20–45 at the wellhead generating an income of US$1.5 million per day.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; Another 2015 estimate sets the monthly income as high as US$40 million.&lt;ref name= rt1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/usa/322330-isis-oil-trucks-destroyed/ | title=US airstrikes destroy more than 100 ISIS oil trucks in Syria| publisher=RT |date=16 November 2015 |accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other reports indicated in 2015 that ISIS obtained 1.1 to 1.5 million dollars a day from selling of oil and its products.&lt;ref name="Finantial"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ig.ft.com/sites/2015/isis-oil/ | title=Inside Isis Inc: The journey of a barrel of oil | work=Financial Times | date=11 December 2015 | accessdate=27 December 2015 | author=Solomon, Erika | author2=Kwong, Robin | author3=Bernard, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tass"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://tass.ru/en/politics/845182 | title=Russia unveils schemes of Islamic State’s oil supplies to Turkey to UN | work=TASS | date=18 December 2015 | accessdate=27 December 2015 | author=Staff writers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;  At the end of 2015 [[Military intervention against ISIL|increased air strikes]] targeting oil production and distribution started to affect oil operations.&lt;ref name=heuvelen&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.iraqoilreport.com/news/armed-intel-u-s-strikes-curtail-oil-sector-17473/| author=Van Heuvelen B and staff |title=Armed with intel, U.S. strikes curtail IS oil sector |publisher=Iraq Oil Report| date=28 December 2015 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus an estimate for March 2016 was a monthly income of about US$20 million.&lt;ref name=warrick/&gt;

==Oil fields under ISIS control==
{{Further information|List of oil fields in Libya claimed by ISIL}}
In 2013 ISIL moved operations from the north of Syria to its east in recognition of the importance of the oil fields for its operations, among the fields in the [[Deir Ezzor]] region such as the al-Omar, the Deiro and the al-Tanak fields, and outside this region, the al-Jabsah fields and al Tabqa fields.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;[http://ig.ft.com/sites/2015/isis-oil/  Financial Times: Inside Isis Inc: The journey of a barrel of oil]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deir Ezzor]] oil field is located in [[Deir ez-Zor]] province that produces 34,000-40,000 barrels a day. al-Omar and al-Tanak are top producing and beneficial oil fields. Quality of Petroleum determined price of each barrel sold at the wellhead 25 to 45 dollars.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/b8234932-719b-11e5-ad6d-f4ed76f0900a.html#axzz3vWs4y7f8 | title=Jihadis’ oil operation forces even their enemies to trade with them | work=Financial Times | date=14 October 2015 | accessdate=28 December 2015 | author=Solomon, Erika | author2=Chazan, Guy | author3=Jones, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iraq ISIL conquered the Ajil and Allas oil fields in northern Iraq during the [[Fall of Mosul|Mosul campaign in 2014]]. These areas were later recaptured by the Iraq army.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; Also, in north of Iraq, the Qayyarah oil field was controlled by ISIS producing 8,000 barrels a day of [[heavy crude oil]].&lt;ref name="Finantial" /&gt; Ajil in north of [[Tikrit]] and Himiran were important ISIS-controlled oil fields in Iraq.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/19/-sp-islamic-state-oil-empire-iraq-isis | title=Inside Islamic State’s oil empire: how captured oilfields fuel Isis insurgency | work=Theguardian | date=19 November 2014 | accessdate=27 December 2015 | author=Hawramy, Fazel | author2=Mohammad, Shalaw | author3=Harding, Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISIL had been able recruit engineers and expert personnel to manage the oil production sites. Oil production was centrally controlled by the top leadership. Until his death in May 2015, [[Abu Sayyaf (ISIL)|Abu Sayyaf]] had been the "emir" or top official for oil production&lt;ref name="solomon" /&gt; controlling oil production from 200-plus wells.&lt;ref name="heuvelen" /&gt;

At the end of September 2016, [[Rudaw Media Network|Rudaw]] (a Kurdish media organization) reported that ISIL no longer controlled any Iraqi oil after Shargat and Qayyarah had been recaptured by the Iraqi army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/270920164| publisher=[[Rudaw Media Network]]|title=ISIS no longer controls any Iraqi oil |date=September 27, 2016 |accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local distribution ==
ISIL made its money at the pump where it sold its products to usually independent traders from Syria and Iraq.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; In addition, ISIL taxed oil in the distribution system.&lt;ref name=heuvelen/&gt; It had been estimated that there was a fleet of about 1,000 delivery trucks.&lt;ref name=rt1/&gt; Oil was brought to local refineries to produce petrol and mazout.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; Many "refineries" were just rudimentary furnaces spread along the roadsides.&lt;ref name=bb2/&gt; Most of these oil products were sold within ISIL-controlled areas in Syria and Iraq by traders. Rebel-held areas in northern Syria were also receiving oil from ISIL.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

ISIS had several markets in Iraqi and Syrian towns and provinces. Some of the largest ISIS oil market were [[Manbij]], [[Al-Bab]], and [[Al-Qa'im (town)|Al-Qa'im]].&lt;ref name="Finantial" /&gt;

== Oil smuggling ==

In January 2016 the Israeli Defence minister alleged that Turkey was buying oil from ISIS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35415956|title=Israeli defence minister accuses Turkey of buying IS oil|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=26 January 2016|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, an RT documentary presented documents left by retreating ISIL operatives and witness reports that also suggested a link between ISIL's oil production and support by Turkey that, in turn, was benefiting from cheap oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/news/336967-isis-files-oil-turkey-exclusive/ |title=ISIS, oil &amp; Turkey: What RT found in Syrian town liberated from jihadists by Kurds (EXCLUSIVE) |publisher=RT |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the allegations, Serko Cevdet, the head of the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government's (KRG) energy commission, told the Turkish media that the trucks in the footage actually belonged to the Kurds and there was no way that ISIL could have transported them through a Kurdish controlled territory due to the ongoing conflict between the Kurds and ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kurds Deny Russian 'Proof' of Turkish IS Oil Smuggling; Turkey Alleges Russian Links to IS Oil|url=https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/4684-kurds-deny-russian-proof-of-turkish-is-oil-smuggling-turkey-alleges-russian-links-to-is-oil|accessdate=10 May 2017|work=OCCRP|date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fawaz Gerges from the London School of Economics and Political Science argued that the claims about Turkey's involvement in ISIL oil trade were conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=John|first1=Tara|title=Is Turkey Really Benefiting From Oil Trade With ISIS?|url=http://time.com/4132346/turkey-isis-oil/|accessdate=10 May 2017|work=Time|date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 [[WikiLeaks]] published more than 57,000 emails from 2010 to 2016 reportedly obtained by the [[hacktivist]] group [[Redhack]] that linked ISIL with Turkey's Minister of Oil [[Berat Albayrak]], [[Tayyip Erdogan]]'s son-in-law, by allegedly "proving his connection to ISIS operation smuggling oil into Turkey," even years after Turkey banned most oil imports from ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4006568/WikiLeaks-reveals-57-000-emails-son-law-President-Erdogan-proving-connection-ISIS-operation-smuggling-oil-Turkey.html|author=Hannah Al-Othman |title=WikiLeaks reveals 57,000 emails from the son-in-law of President Erdogan, 'proving his connection to ISIS operation smuggling oil into Turkey' |work=Daily Mail |date=December 9, 2016 |accessdate=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the allegations, [[John R.

Arab media accused [[Israel]] of being a major buyer of oil [[Smuggling|smuggled]] out of the ISIL-held Syrian and Iraqi territories.&lt;ref name=globes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article.aspx?did=1001084873|title=Israel has become the main buyer for oil from ISIS controlled territory, reports "al-Araby al-Jadeed." |work=Globes |date=11 November 2015 |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this accusation, oil was smuggled to [[Zakhu]] where Israeli and Turkish dealers would determine the price, the oil was then sent as Kurdish oil to [[Silopi]], Turkey, and transported to Turkish ports (such as [[Ceyhan]]) and shipped to Israel.&lt;ref name=globes /&gt;

=== Ways of smuggling ===
[[File:Kirkuk–Ceyhan oil pipeline.svg|thumb|The Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline]]
ISIL transferred oil in different ways out of its territory. Oil could be trucked to Turkey, refined there and be used in Turkey or transported to tankers at the ports of [[Ceyhan]] or [[Dortyol]].&lt;ref name=banco&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/how-isis-oil-ended-us-streets-2344465|author=Erin Banco|title=How ISIS Oil Ended Up On US Streets|work=International Business Times |date=29 March 2016|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil could also be sold to middlemen in northern Iraq who then would mix it with legitimate oil that enter through one of many feeders the [[Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline]].&lt;ref name=banco /&gt; At the end of the pipeline it would have been difficult to determine if some ISIS oil was present in the mix that was supposed to come from Kurdish fields.&lt;ref name=banco /&gt;

Another way of smuggling was the transport of oil to Jordan. Smugglers went south through [[Al Anbar Governorate|Al Anbar province]] towards [[Jordan]].&lt;ref name="Finantial" /&gt; In fact, Al Anbar was known as a major smuggling hub in Iraq.&lt;ref name="theguardian" /&gt; Sami Khalaf, an oil smuggler and former Iraqi intelligence officer under Saddam Hussein, said that: "We buy an oil tanker carrying around 26 to 28 tonnes [of oil] for $4,200. We sell it in Jordan for $15,000. Each smuggler takes around eight tankers a week." Also, he added: "smugglers typically paid corrupt border officials $650 to pass through each checkpoint."&lt;ref name="theguardian" /&gt;

In January 2017, US officials indicated that revenues from oil and gas sold to President [[Bashar al-Assad]]'s government had become the main revenue for ISIL.&lt;ref name=forbes17&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/01/20/oil-gas-isis-syria-assad/ |author=Feliz Solomon|title=Oil and Gas Sales to the Syrian Regime Are Now ISIS’s Largest Source of Funds, Report Says |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=January 20, 2017|accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trucks that previously delivered oil to Turkey and Iraq had been re-directed to territory controlled by Assad.&lt;ref name=forbes17 /&gt;

==ISIL oil production as a military target==
While degrading oil operations is an obvious target for military operations, the United States was reported to have refrained from using this approach out of concerns for civilian casualties and destabilizing the life of a ten million population that depended on oil from ISIL production.&lt;ref name=rt1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;&lt;ref name=bb2/&gt; Also, rebel-held areas supported by the U.S. depended on ISIL oil for sustenance.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; Further, direct hits on oil fields could lead to a natural disaster and make future use difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/daily_videos/how-isis-steals-oil-to-stay-in-power/ |title= How ISIS steals oil to stay in power| publisher=PBS |date=19 October 2015 |accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SyrianOilRefineryStrikesRADM Jeribe Modular Oil Refinery (Sep. 2014).jpg|thumb|right|U.S. airstrike against Jeribe modular oil refinery, September 2014]]
While [[Bloomberg Business]] reported in the fall of 2014 that U.S. airstrikes had significantly reduced ISIL oil business,&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt; the [[Financial Times]] reported in October 2015 that only 196 of 10,600 air strikes by U.S. led coalition forces were conducted against oil infrastructure since August 2014 and that ISIL continued a very profitable oil business generating about $1.5 million per day.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; In late 2015 a U.S. spokesman conceded that the effectiveness of past air strikes against oil-related targets had been grossly overestimated while the importance of oil production as a revenue maker had been underestimated.&lt;ref name=bb2/&gt;

When in May 2015 U.S. forces conducted a raid that killed Abu Sayyaf, detailed records of the oil operation of ISIL were obtained.&lt;ref name=heuvelen/&gt; The recognition of the significance of oil for ISIL and insights into its operations led to a new focus in air strikes.&lt;ref name=heuvelen/&gt; Thus, on 21 October 2015 the U.S. launched operation ''[[Operation Tidal Wave II]]'' in reference to [[Operation Tidal Wave]] in World War II in a renewed effort to reduce the ability of ISIL to fund itself through oil production.&lt;ref name=cosgrove&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/10/us-air-force-pledges-to-degrade-isis-oil-cash.html |author=Jenny Cosgrove| title=US Air Force pledges to 'degrade' ISIS oil cash |publisher=[[CNBC]]| date=10 November 2015 |accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=matyshak &gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/13/ISIS-Making-Millions-US-Boosts-Its-Attacks-Oil-Fields| author=Martin Matyshak |title= With ISIS Making Millions, U.S. Boosts Its Attacks on Oil Fields| publisher=[[The Fiscal Times]]| date=13 November 2015| accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2015 Russia established [[Khmeimim (air base)|Khmeimim air base]] in Syria. After the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] the French Defence Minister [[Jean-Yves Le Drian]] indicated that degradation of oil production as the "lifeblood" of ISIL needed to be at the center of military strategy.&lt;ref name=dm/&gt; In an effort to reduce revenue for ISIL more oil tankers were destroyed later in the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-in-syria-us-air-strikes-destroys-283-oil-tankers-used-for-smuggling-to-fund-terror-group-a6746211.html |author=Lizzie Dearden| title=Isis in Syria: US air strikes destroys 283 oil tankers used for smuggling to fund terror group |publisher=The Independent| date=24 November 2015 |accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to targeted air raids, smuggling trucks had sometimes waited for weeks in queues near the oil fields to buy crude.&lt;ref name="Finantial" /&gt; The defense ministry of [[Moscow]] released satellite images showing columns of waiting trucks near the border of [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-releases-proof-turkey-is-smuggling-isis-oil-over-its-border-a6757651.html | title=Russia unveils 'proof' Turkey's Erdogan is smuggling Isis oil across border from Syria | work=Independent | date=4 December 2015 | accessdate=27 December 2015 | author=Brooks-Pollock, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Russian air attacks against smuggling trucks, ISIS changed its system to prevent the formation of long queues.&lt;ref name="Finantial" /&gt;

A report at the end of December 2015 indicated that ISIL was starting to have financial problems due to lower oil revenues resulting in lower salaries for foreign fighters and higher prices for electricity and oil in [[Raqqa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.focus.de/finanzen/news/kampf-gegen-den-terror-zu-hohe-ausgaben-islamischer-staat-geht-allmaehlich-das-geld-aus_id_5176872.html |title= Höhere Steuern, niedrigere Gehälter: Terror-Staat IS kämpft gegen die Pleite |publisher=Focus |language=German|date=27 December 2015 |accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shortage of oil within ISIL-controlled territories had resulted in energy shortages with less electricity and water becoming available.&lt;ref name=heuvelen/&gt; Also, smuggling of oil had decreased as it had become more dangerous and less lucrative.&lt;ref name=heuvelen/&gt;

A 2016 analysis of ISIL's response to the air strikes on the oil infrastructure indicated the development of multiple tiny makeshift refineries in oil fields under their control.&lt;ref name=warrick&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/07/satellite-photos-show-isis-installing-hundreds-of-makeshift-oil-refineries-to-offset-losses-from-air-strikes/?tid=a_inl |author=Joby Warrick|title=Satellite photos show Islamic State installing hundreds of makeshift oil refineries to offset losses from airstrikes |journal=[[Washington Post]] |date=7 July 2016 |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These micro-refineries consisted of a pit to store crude and a portable metal furnace to distill it into fuel.&lt;ref name=warrick/&gt; The operation was dirty and relatively inefficient but harder to destroy. According to [[Stratfor]] income from oil had declined to about $20 million a month (March 2016).&lt;ref name=warrick/&gt;

[[File:Calcareous Soil Profile, Seven Sisters Country Park - geograph.org.uk - 1280181.jpg|thumb|Soil Profile on [[Chalk]] at Seven Sisters Country Park, England]]

'''Pedology''' (from Greek: πέδον, ''pedon'', "soil"; and λόγος, ''logos'', "study") is the study of [[soil]]s in their natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://natres.psu.ac.th/Link/SoilCongress/bdd/symp45/75-t.pdf | title = Soil Preservation and the Future of Pedology | author = Ronald Amundsen |accessdate = 2006-06-08|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of two main branches of [[soil science]], the other being [[edaphology]]. Pedology deals with [[pedogenesis]], [[soil morphology]], and [[soil classification]], while edaphology studies the way soils influence [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], and other living things.

==Overview==
[[Soil]] is not only a support for vegetation, but it is also the [[pedosphere]], the locus of numerous interactions between [[climate]] (water, air, temperature), [[soil life]] (micro-organisms, plants, animals) and its residues,  the [[mineral]] material of the original and added [[Rock (geology)|rock]], and its position in the landscape. During its formation and genesis, the [[soil profile]] slowly deepens and develops characteristic layers, called 'horizons', while a steady state balance is approached.

Soil users (such as [[agronomist]]s) showed initially little concern in the dynamics of soil.  They saw it as medium whose chemical, physical and biological properties were useful for the services of agronomic productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Saltini Antonio, ''Storia delle scienze agrarie'', 4 vols, Bologna 1984-89, {{ISBN|88-206-2412-5}}, {{ISBN|88-206-2413-3}}, {{ISBN|88-206-2414-1}}, {{ISBN|88-206-2415-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, pedologists and geologists did not initially focus on the agronomic applications of the soil characteristics (edaphic properties) but upon its relation to the nature and history of landscapes. Today, there is an integration of the two disciplinary approaches as part of landscape and environmental sciences.

Pedologists are now also interested in the practical applications of a good understanding of  [[pedogenesis]] processes (the evolution and functioning of soils), like interpreting its environmental history and predicting consequences of changes in land use, while agronomists understand that the cultivated soil is a complex medium, often resulting from several thousands of years of evolution. They understand that the current balance is fragile and that only a thorough knowledge of its history makes it possible to ensure its [[sustainable development|sustainable]] use.

==Concepts==
Important pedological concepts include:&lt;ref&gt;Buol, Stanley W., F,D. Hole and R.W. McCracken. 1997. Soil Genesis and Classification, 4th ed. Iowa State Univ. Press, Ames {{ISBN|0-8138-2873-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hole Francis D., J.B. Campbell. 1985. Soil landscape analysis. Totowa Rowman &amp; Allanheld, 214 p. {{ISBN|0-86598-140-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bockheim|first1=J.G.|last2=Gennadiyev|first2=A.N.|last3=Hammer|first3=R.D.|last4=Tandarich|first4=J.P.|title=Historical development of key concepts in pedology|journal=Geoderma|date=January 2005|volume=124|issue=1-2|pages=23–36|doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2004.03.004|url=http://www.envsci.rutgers.edu/~gimenez/SoilsandWater08/Homeworks/Bockheim.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Complexity in [[pedogenesis|soil genesis]] is more common than simplicity.
* Soils lie at the interface of [[Earth's atmosphere]], [[biosphere]], [[hydrosphere]] and [[lithosphere]]. Therefore, a thorough understanding of soils requires some knowledge of [[meteorology]], [[climatology]], [[ecology]], [[biology]], [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology]], [[geology]] and many other [[earth sciences]] and [[natural sciences]].
* Contemporary soils carry imprints of pedogenic processes that were active in the past, although in many cases these imprints are difficult to observe or quantify. Thus, knowledge of [[paleoecology]], [[palaeogeography]], [[glacial geology]] and [[paleoclimatology]] is important for the recognition and understanding of soil genesis and constitute a basis for predicting future soil changes.
* Five major, external factors of formation ([[climate]], [[soil life|organisms]], [[topography|relief]], [[parent material]] and [[geologic time scale|time]]), and several smaller, less identifiable ones, drive pedogenic processes and create soil patterns.
* Characteristics of soils and soil landscapes, e.g., the number, sizes, shapes and arrangements of soil bodies, each of which is characterized on the basis of [[soil horizons]], degree of internal homogeneity, [[slope]], [[Aspect (geography)|aspect]], landscape position, age and other properties and relationships, can be observed and measured.
* Distinctive bioclimatic regimes or combinations of pedogenic processes produce distinctive soils. Thus, distinctive, observable [[soil morphology|morphological features]], e.g., [[illuvial]] clay accumulation in B horizons, are produced by certain combinations of pedogenic processes operative over varying periods of time.
* [[Pedogenesis|Pedogenic]] (soil-forming) processes act to both create and destroy order ([[anisotropy]]) within soils; these processes can proceed simultaneously. The resulting [[soil profile]] reflects the balance of these processes, present and past.
* The geological Principle of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|Uniformitarianism]] applies to soils, i.e., pedogenic processes active in soils today have been operating for long periods of time, back to the time of appearance of organisms on the land surface. These processes do, however, have varying degrees of expression and intensity over space and time.
* A succession of different soils may have developed, eroded and/or [[soils retrogression and degradation|regressed]] at any particular site, as soil genetic factors and site factors, e.g., [[vegetation]], [[sedimentation]], [[geomorphology]], change.
* There are very few old soils (in a geological sense) because they can be destroyed or buried by geological events, or modified by shifts in climate by virtue of their vulnerable position at the surface of the earth. Little of the soil continuum dates back beyond the [[Tertiary]] period and most soils and land surfaces are no older than the [[Pleistocene]] Epoch. However, preserved/lithified soils ([[paleosol]]s) are an almost ubiquitous feature in terrestrial (land-based) environments throughout most of geologic time. Since they record evidence of ancient climate change, they present immense utility in understanding climate evolution throughout geologic history.
* Knowledge and understanding of the genesis of a soil is important in its [[soil classification|classification]] and [[soil mapping|mapping]].
* Soil classification systems cannot be based entirely on perceptions of genesis, however, because genetic processes are seldom observed and because pedogenic processes change over time.
* Knowledge of soil genesis is imperative and basic to soil use and management. Human influence on, or adjustment to, the factors and processes of soil formation can be best controlled and planned using knowledge about soil genesis.
* Soils are natural clay factories ([[clay]] includes both [[clay mineral]] structures and particles less than 2&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter). [[Shale]]s worldwide are, to a considerable extent, simply soil clays that have been formed in the [[pedosphere]] and [[eroded]] and deposited in the ocean basins, to become [[lithified]] at a later date.

'''Planetary consciousness''' is the idea that human beings are members of a planetary society of [[Earth]] as much as they are members of their nations, provinces, districts, islands, cities or villages.

== History ==
In his 1906 book ''American Character'', author [[Brander Matthews]] mentions the idea of a "league of nations" and a "planetary consciousness", believing it would be created by American politicians in the coming centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=UA2WY1GvV-oC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=%22League+of+Nations%22+%22planetary+consciousness%22+-wikipedia#v=onepage&amp;q=%22League%20of%20Nations%22%20%22planetary%20consciousness%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false | author=Matthews, Brander | authorlink=Brander Matthews | title=American Character | page=187 | publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell &amp; Co |date=September 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key planetary consciousness events of the 20th century include the creation of the [[League of Nations]], the signing of [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], the creation of the [[United Nations]], and the creation of the [[Bretton Woods system]].  [[Democratic globalization]] advocate [[Abhay Kumar]] points to the [[ICANN|International Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) board of directors election in 2000, which were conducted globally, as the first example of global democracy.&lt;ref name=abhay&gt;{{cite news | title=Birth of Global Democracy | author=K, Abhay | authorlink=Abhay Kumar | work=[[Times of India]] | date=21 January 2011 | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-21/edit-page/28367706_1_printing-press-number-of-mobile-phones-gutenberg | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2001, [[Ervin László]] and the [[Dalai Lama]] wrote an essay titled "Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness", which was adopted at a meeting at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in Budapest.&lt;ref name=manifesto&gt;{{cite web | author1=László, Ervin | authorlink1=Ervin László | author2=[[Dalai Lama]] | title=Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness | publisher=WorldShift International | date=15 September 2001 | url=http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | accessdate=13 August 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828003626/http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | archivedate=28 August 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its introduction begins:

{{cquote|text=In the closing years of the twentieth century, we have reached a crucial juncture in our history. We are on the threshold of a new stage of social, spiritual, and cultural evolution, a stage that is as different from the stage of the earlier decades of this century as the grasslands were from the caves, and settled villages from life in nomadic tribes. We are evolving out of the nationally based industrial societies that were created at the dawn of the first industrial revolution, and heading toward an interconnected, information-based social, economic, and cultural system that straddles the globe.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

[[Andreas Bummel]], CEO of the Committee for a Democratic UN, says, "The first step into the direction of a world parliament would be the establishment of a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations".&lt;ref name=bummel/&gt;

==Concept==
Advocacy for the idea of planetary consciousness is based on the technological advancements made by the mankind in the fields of transport and telecommunications during the 20th century and in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; Kumar claims that these technological advancements have turned the whole planet into an interdependent economic, political and communication community.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He specifically cites the invention of the Internet and the mobile phones as key technological achievements of the 20th century which brought humans into more continuous interconnected communication.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He believes that these inventions will lead to a second [[Renaissance]] and global democracy, just as the [[Gutenberg press]] in 1439 led to the first Renaissance, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and [[Nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt;  Bummel describes planetary consciousness as integral, insofar as it does not conflict with other levels of [[Identity (social science)|social identity]], but instead is a holistic perspective on humanity and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref name=bummel&gt;{{cite journal | title=Social Evolution, Global Governance and a World Parliament | author=Bummel, Andreas | journal=[[Cadmus (journal)|Cadmus]] | date=11 April 2012 |url=http://www.cadmusjournal.org/article/issue-4/social-evolution-global-governance-and-world-parliament#13 | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steven Kull writes that while nation states are reluctant to work cooperatively, individuals seem more willing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kull, Steven | title=Listening to the Voice of Humanity | journal= Kosmos Journal | issue=Spring/Summer | year= 2010 | pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire planetary consciousness and [[global citizenship]] among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Being able to accurately identify pollen has a wide range of applications though it has been difficult in the past due to the limitations of [[Microscope|microscopic]] identification of pollen.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Karen L.|last2=de Vere|first2=Natasha|last3=Keller|first3=Alexander|last4=Richardson|first4=Rodney T.|last5=Gous|first5=Annemarie|last6=Burgess|first6=Kevin S.|last7=Brosi|first7=Berry J.|date=2016-04-13|title=Pollen DNA barcoding: current applications and future prospects|journal=Genome|volume=59|issue=9|pages=629–640|doi=10.1139/gen-2015-0200|pmid=27322652|issn=0831-2796|hdl=1807/72815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollen identified using DNA barcoding involves the specific targeting of gene regions that are found in most to all plant species but have high variation between members of different species. The unique sequence of base pairs for each species within these target regions can be used as an identifying feature.

The applications of pollen DNA barcoding range from [[Forensic science|forensics]], to [[food safety]], to [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. Each of these fields benefits from the creation of plant barcode reference libraries.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Karen L.|last2=Loeffler|first2=Virginia M.|last3=Brosi|first3=Berry J.|date=2017-03-01|title=An rbcL Reference Library to Aid in the Identification of Plant Species Mixtures by DNA Metabarcoding|journal=Applications in Plant Sciences|volume=5|issue=3|pages=1600110|doi=10.3732/apps.1600110|pmid=28337390|pmc=5357121}}&lt;/ref&gt; These libraries range largely in size and scope of their collections as well as what target region(s) they specialize in.

One of the main challenges of identifying pollen is that it is often collected as a mixture of pollen from several species. '''Metabarcoding'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cristescu|first=Melania E.|title=From barcoding single individuals to metabarcoding biological communities: towards an integrative approach to the study of global biodiversity|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=29|issue=10|pages=566–571|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2014.08.001|pmid=25175416|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of identifying the individual species DNA from a mixed DNA sample and is commonly used to catalog pollen in mixed pollen loads found on pollinating animals and in [[environmental DNA]] (also called eDNA) which is DNA extracted straight from the environment such as in soil or water samples.

== Advantages ==
Some of the principle constraints of microscopic identification are the expertise and time requirements. Identifying pollen via microscopy requires a high level of expertise in the pollen characteristics of the specific plants being studied. With expertise it can still be extremely difficult to identify pollen accurately with high taxonomic resolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The skills required to do DNA barcoding are much more common&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adamowicz|first=Sarah J.|last2=Steinke|first2=Dirk|date=2015-11-10|title=Increasing global participation in genetics research through DNA barcoding|journal=Genome|volume=58|issue=12|pages=519–526|doi=10.1139/gen-2015-0130|pmid=26642251|issn=0831-2796|hdl=1807/70679}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the approach easier to adopt. Pollen DNA barcoding is a technique that has grown in popularity due to the decreased costs associated with "next generation sequencing" (NGS) techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Sang Tae|last2=Kim|first2=Jayoung|date=November 2016|title=Trends in Next-Generation Sequencing and a New Era for Whole Genome Sequencing|journal=International Neurourology Journal|volume=20|issue=Suppl 2|pages=S76–83|doi=10.5213/inj.1632742.371|pmc=5169091|pmid=27915479}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is being continually improved in efficiency including through the use of a dual-indexing approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sickel|first=Wiebke|last2=Ankenbrand|first2=Markus J.|last3=Grimmer|first3=Gudrun|last4=Holzschuh|first4=Andrea|last5=Härtel|first5=Stephan|last6=Lanzen|first6=Jonathan|last7=Steffan-Dewenter|first7=Ingolf|last8=Keller|first8=Alexander|date=2015-07-22|title=Increased efficiency in identifying mixed pollen samples by meta-barcoding with a dual-indexing approach|journal=BMC Ecology|volume=15|pages=20|doi=10.1186/s12898-015-0051-y|pmid=26194794|pmc=4509727|issn=1472-6785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other major advantages include the savings in time and resources compared to microscopic identification. Identifying pollen is time consuming involving spreading pollen on a slide, staining the pollen to improve visibility, then focusing in on individual pollen grains and identifying them based on size, shape, as well as the shape and number of pores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Yan-Hui|last2=Ren|first2=Zong-Xin|last3=Lázaro|first3=Amparo|last4=Wang|first4=Hong|last5=Bernhardt|first5=Peter|last6=Li|first6=Hai-Dong|last7=Li|first7=De-Zhu|date=2016-05-24|title=Floral traits influence pollen vectors' choices in higher elevation communities in the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains|journal=BMC Ecology|volume=16|pages=26|doi=10.1186/s12898-016-0080-1|pmid=27221235|pmc=4879733|issn=1472-6785}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a pollen reference library is not available, then pollen has to be collected from wild specimens or from [[herbarium]] specimens and is then added to a pollen reference library.

== Challenges ==
There are many challenges when it comes to genetic barcoding of pollen. The [[Polymerase chain reaction|amplification]] process of DNA can mean that even small pieces of plant DNA can be detected included those from contaminants to a sample. Strict procedures to prevent contamination are important and can be facilitated by the hardiness of the pollen coat allowing the pollen to be washed of contaminants without damaging the internal pollen DNA.

DNA barcode reference libraries are still being built and standardized target regions are being gradually adopted. These challenges are likely due to the newness of DNA barcoding and will likely improve with the wider adoption of DNA barcoding as a tool used by taxonomists.

Determining the amount of each contributor to a mixed pollen load can be difficult to determine through the use of DNA barcoding. However, scientists have been able to compare pollen amounts via rank order.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Rodney T.|last2=Lin|first2=Chia-Hua|last3=Quijia|first3=Juan O.|last4=Riusech|first4=Natalia S.|last5=Goodell|first5=Karen|last6=Johnson|first6=Reed M.|date=2015-10-30|title=Rank-Based Characterization of Pollen Assemblages Collected by Honey Bees Using a Multi-Locus Metabarcoding Approach|journal=Applications in Plant Sciences|volume=3|issue=11|pages=1500043|doi=10.3732/apps.1500043|pmid=26649264|pmc=4651628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternatives ===
Innovations in automated microscopy and imagining software offer one potential alternative in the identification of pollen. Through the use of pattern-recognition software, researchers have developed software that can characterize microscopic pollen images based on texture analyzes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcos|first=J.

=== Forensics ===
Being accurately able to identify pollen found on evidence helps forensic investigators identify which regions evidence originated from based on the plants that are endemic to those regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller Coyle|first=H.|last2=Ladd|first2=C.|last3=Palmbach|first3=T.|last4=Lee|first4=H.

=== Ancient pollen ===
Due to the hardy structure of pollen which has evolved to survive being transported sometimes great distances while keeping the internal genetic information intact, the origin of pollen found mixed in ancient substrates can often be determined through DNA barcoding.

=== Food safety ===
Honeybees carry pollen as well as the nectar used in their production of honey. For food quality and safety concerns it is important to understand the plant providence of human-consumed bee products including honey, royal jelly, and pollen pellets. Investigators can test which plants honeybees foraged on and thus the origin of the nectar used in honey by collecting pollen packets from honeybees' [[Pollen basket|corbicular loads]] and identify the pollen via DNA metabarcoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galimberti|first=Andrea|last2=Mattia|first2=Fabrizio De|last3=Bruni|first3=Ilaria|last4=Scaccabarozzi|first4=Daniela|last5=Sandionigi|first5=Anna|last6=Barbuto|first6=Michela|last7=Casiraghi|first7=Maurizio|last8=Labra|first8=Massimo|date=2014-10-08|title=A DNA Barcoding Approach to Characterize Pollen Collected by Honeybees|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=9|issue=10|pages=e109363|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0109363|pmid=25296114|pmc=4190116|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Extratropical cyclone]], which is [[Weather front|frontal]], sometimes still retains winds of hurricane or [[tropical storm]] force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml#EXTRA|title=Glossary of NHC Terms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Remnant low, which is non-frontal, has maximum sustained winds of less than 34 knots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml#REM|title=Glossary of NHC Terms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all systems fall into the above two classes. According to the guideline, a system without frontal characteristics but with maximum winds above 34 knots may not be designated as a remnant low. It should be merely described as post-tropical.&lt;ref name="noaa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/notification/scn10-06trop_cyclone_terms.txt |title=SERVICE CHANGE NOTICE 10-06 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=January 15, 2010 |website=[[Nws.noaa.gov]] |publisher=National Weather Service |access-date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few examples falling into this grey area are listed below.

However, there has been an occasion that the [[United States]] [[National Hurricane Center]] violated the definition and designated [[2011 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Calvin|Calvin]] (2011) as a 35-knot remnant low.&lt;ref&gt;{{NHC TCR url|id=EP032011_Calvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, if a tropical cyclone degenerates into a [[tropical wave]] or [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]], then it does not qualify as a post-tropical cyclone. It would be referred as the "remnants of (tropical cyclone name)".

[[Météo-France]] classifies systems in the South-West Indian Ocean undergoing an [[extratropical transition]] or losing tropical characteristics as “post-tropical depressions”, since the [[2012–13 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|2012–13 cyclone season]]. They would be re-classified as extratropical depressions after completing the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meteofrance.re/cyclone/saisons-passees/2012-2013|title=Saison 2012-2013|publisher=Météo-France|language=French|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
A post-tropical cyclone is formed when the typical characteristics of a [[tropical cyclone]] are replaced with those of [[extratropical cyclone]]s, otherwise known as [[extratropical transition]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelissero|first=Jonathon|last2=Chiao|first2=Sen|date=July 5, 2013|title=The influences of post-tropical reintensification and dissipation on North Atlantic shipping routes|url=http://libezp.lib.lsu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edb&amp;AN=97177623&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds-main|journal=[[Meteorological Applications]]|publisher=[[Royal Meteorological Society]]|volume=21|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial formation, a post-tropical cyclone has the potential to gain strength and intensity by forming an extratropical storm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If a post-tropical cyclone does become an extratropical storm, it will eventually decay through the process of occlusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/extratropical-cyclone|title=Extratropical Cyclone|last=|first=|date=|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts ==
The re-intensification of a post-tropical cyclone can cause dangerous conditions in North Atlantic shipping routes with high seas and winds comparable to those of [[hurricanes]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Origin==
The terminology was initiated by [[Canadian Hurricane Centre]] in 1998 during [[Hurricane Bonnie (1998)|Tropical Storm Bonnie]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans-hurricanes/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=5375B60F-1&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the National Hurricane Center used this term for [[Tropical Storm Laura (2008)|Tropical Storm Laura]] to address the limitation of the two classes (extratropical/remnant low) mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/al12/al122008.discus.010.shtml|title=Tropical Storm LAURA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later adopted by the [[National Weather Service]] on May 15, 2010.&lt;ref name="noaa.gov"/&gt;

==Synonym==
The [[Bureau of Meteorology]] in [[Australia]] refers a former tropical cyclone as an "ex-tropical cyclone".{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} An example is [[Cyclone Oswald|ex-tropical cyclone Oswald]].

'''''Reaction Time: Climate Change and the Nuclear Option''''' is a book by Professor [[Ian Lowe]] which was officially launched by science broadcaster [[Robyn Williams]] at the Writers' Festival in Brisbane in September 2007.  The book is about [[energy policy]], and Lowe argues that [[nuclear power]] does not make sense on any level: economically, environmentally, politically or socially.&lt;ref name=lowe&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/14/2032596.htm Reaction time: climate change and the nuclear option]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Ian Lowe, [[Order of Australia|AO]], explains that energy is essential for civilised living, and says our energy-intensive lifestyle based on fossil fuels is unsustainable, and that he believes fundamental improvements must be made. In his book he says: ''"the nuclear option does not make sense on any level: economically, environmentally, politically or socially. It is too costly, too dangerous, too slow and has too small an impact on global warming."'' &lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;

==Quote==
:"Promoting nuclear power as the solution to climate change is like advocating smoking as a cure for obesity. That is, taking up the nuclear option will make it much more difficult to move to the sort of sustainable, ecologically healthy future that should be our goal."&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Ian (2007). Reaction time: climate change and the nuclear option, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
Professor Lowe is the Emeritus professor of ''[[Science and technology studies|Science, Technology and Society]]'' at [[Griffith University]] and the former President of the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/melbourne/stories/s2031036.htm Ian Lowe, Liam Black and Dean Skinner]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15509">The '''Simon-Ehrlich Wager''' describes a 1980 [[scientific wager]] between business professor [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian L. Simon]] and biologist [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]], betting on a mutually agreed-upon measure of [[Natural resource|resource]] [[scarcity]] over the decade leading up to 1990. The widely-followed contest originated in the pages of ''[[Social Science Quarterly]]'', where Simon challenged Ehrlich to put his money where his mouth was. In response to Ehrlich's published claim that "If I were a gambler, I would take [[even money]] that England will not exist in the year 2000" Simon offered to take that bet, or, more realistically, "to stake US$10,000 ... on my belief that the cost of non-government-controlled raw materials (including grain and oil) will not rise in the long run."

Simon challenged Ehrlich to choose any raw material he wanted and a date more than a year away, and he would wager on the inflation-adjusted prices decreasing as opposed to increasing. Ehrlich chose [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], [[tin]], and [[tungsten]]. The bet was formalized on September 29, 1980, with September 29, 1990 as the payoff date. Ehrlich lost the bet, as all five commodities that were bet on declined in price from 1980 through 1990, the wager period.&lt;ref name=Gorelick&gt;{{cite book|last=Gorelick|first=Steven M.|title=Oil Panic and the Global Crisis: Predictions and Myths|year=2009|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-1405195485|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1968, Ehrlich published ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', which argued that mankind was facing a demographic catastrophe with the rate of population growth quickly outstripping growth in the supply of food and resources. Simon was highly skeptical of such claims, so proposed a wager, telling Ehrlich to select any raw material he wanted and select "any date more than a year away," and Simon would bet that the commodity's price on that date would be lower than what it was at the time of the wager.

Ehrlich and his colleagues picked five metals that they thought would undergo big price increases: chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten. Then, on paper, they bought $200 worth of each, for a total bet of $1,000, using the prices on September 29, 1980, as an index. They designated September 29, 1990, 10 years hence, as the payoff date. If the inflation-adjusted prices of the various metals rose in the interim, Simon would pay Ehrlich the combined difference. If the prices fell, Ehrlich et al. would pay Simon.

Between 1980 and 1990, the world's population grew by more than 800 million, the largest increase in one decade in all of history. But by September 1990, the price of each of Ehrlich's selected metals had fallen. Chromium, which had sold for $3.90 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.70 in 1990. Tin, which was $8.72 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.88 a decade later.&lt;ref name=doomslayer&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, in October 1990, Paul Ehrlich mailed Julian Simon a check for $576.07 to settle the wager in Simon's favor.

==Analysis==
Julian Simon won because the price of three of the five metals went down in nominal terms and all five of the metals fell in price in inflation-adjusted terms, with both tin and tungsten falling by more than half.&lt;ref name=ehrlich-1998/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.overpopulation.com/faq/People/julian_simon.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703014812/http://www.overpopulation.com/faq/People/julian_simon.html |date=July 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Betrayal of Science and Reason'', Ehrlich wrote that Simon "[asserted] that humanity would never run out of anything". Ehrlich added that he and fellow scientists viewed [[renewable resources]] as more important indicators of the state of planet Earth, but that he decided to go along with the bet anyway.&lt;ref name=ehrlich-1998&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ehrlich | first1=Paul | last2=Ehrlich | first2=Anne | authorlink1=Paul Ehrlich | title=Betrayal of Science and Reason: How Anti-Environmental Rhetoric Threatens Our Future | pages=100–104 | year=1998 | isbn=978-1610912501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, Simon offered to raise the wager to $20,000 and to use any resources at any time that Ehrlich preferred. Ehrlich countered with a challenge to bet that temperatures would increase in the future.&lt;ref name=ehrlich-1998/&gt; The two were unable to reach an agreement on the terms of a second wager before Simon died.

He also noted that if the wager had been expanded to "all of the most important commodities," instead of just five metals, over that longer period of 1980 to 2011, then Simon would have lost "by a lot." &lt;ref name=Grantham/&gt; Economist Mark J. Perry noted that for an even longer period of time, from 1934 to 2013, the inflation-adjusted price of the [[Dow Jones]]-AIG Commodity Index showed "an overall significant downward trend" and concluded that Simon was "more right than lucky".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aei.org/publication/julian-simon-still-more-right-than-lucky-in-2013/ | last=Perry | first=Mark J. | title=Julian Simon: Still more right than lucky in 2013 | publisher=[[American Enterprise Institute]] | date=January 12, 2013 | accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist Tim Worstall wrote that "The end result of all of this is that yes, it is true that Ehrlich could have, would have, won the bet depending upon the starting date. ... But the long term trend for metals at least is downwards."&lt;ref name=worstall-2013/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The price of raw and other natural commodities such as oil, gold, and uranium have risen substantially in recent years,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} due to increased demand from [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[India]], and other [[newly industrialized country|industrializing countries]]. However, Simon has argued that this price increase is not necessarily contrary to his [[cornucopian]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Julian|title=The State of Humanity| publisher = Wiley–Blackwell | year = 1996 | page = 24 | isbn = 978-1-55786-585-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich has dismissed the bet as a side issue and stated that the main worry is environmental problems like the [[ozone hole]], [[acid rain]], and [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="Tierney"&gt;{{cite journal |magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |author=John Tierney |date=December 2, 1990 |title=Betting on the Planet |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DA163CF931A35751C1A966958260&amp;pagewanted=all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The proposed second wager==
Understanding that Simon wanted to bet again, Ehrlich and climatologist [[Stephen Schneider]] counter-offered, challenging Simon to bet on 15 current trends, betting $1000 that each will get worse (as in the previous wager) over a ten-year future period.&lt;ref name=ehrlich-1998/&gt;

The trends they bet would continue to worsen were:
* The three years 2002–2004 will on average be warmer than 1992–1994.
* There will be more [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] in 2004 than in 1994.
* There will be more [[nitrous oxide]] in the atmosphere in 2004 than 1994.
* The concentration of [[ozone]] in the lower atmosphere (the [[troposphere]]) will be greater than in 1994.
* Emissions of the air pollutant [[sulfur dioxide]] in [[Asia]] will be significantly greater in 2004 than in 1994.
* There will be less fertile [[cropland]] per person in 2004 than in 1994.
* There will be less [[agriculture|agricultural]] soil per person in 2004 than 1994.
* There will be on average less [[rice]] and [[wheat]] grown per person in 2002–2004 than in 1992–1994.
* In [[developing nations]] there will be less [[firewood]] available per person in 2004 than in 1994.
* The remaining area of virgin tropical moist [[forest]]s will be significantly smaller in 2004 than in 1994.
* The [[ocean]]ic [[fishery]] harvest per person will continue its downward trend and thus in 2004 will be smaller than in 1994.
* There will be fewer [[plant]] and [[animal]] [[species]] still extant in 2004 than in 1994.
* More people will die of [[AIDS]] in 2004 than in 1994.
* Between 1994 and 2004, [[Spermatozoon|sperm cell]] counts of human males will continue to decline and reproductive disorders will continue to increase.
* The [[income inequality|gap in wealth]] between the richest 10% of humanity and the poorest 10% will be greater in 2004 than in 1994.

Simon declined Ehrlich and Schneider's offer to bet, and used the following analogy to explain why he did so:&lt;ref&gt;http://jasoncollins.org/2011/05/20/the-simon-ehrlich-bet/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | Let me characterize their offer as follows. I predict, and this is for real, that the average performances in the next [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] will be better than those in the last Olympics. On average, the performances have gotten better, Olympics to Olympics, for a variety of reasons. What Ehrlich and others says is that they don't want to bet on athletic performances, they want to bet on the conditions of the track, or the weather, or the officials, or any other such indirect measure.}}

In his 1981 book ''[[The Ultimate Resource]]'', Simon noted that not all decreases in resources or increases in unwanted effects correspond to overall decreases in human wellbeing.&lt;ref name="Simon-1981"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Julian|title=The Ultimate Resource|date=August 1981|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=069109389X|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Resource-Julian-Lincoln-Simon/dp/069109389X/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence there can be an "optimal level of pollution" which accepts some increases in certain kinds of pollution in a way that increases overall wellbeing, while acknowledging that any increase in pollution is nevertheless a cost which must be considered in any such calculation (p.143). Some of the trends listed above are actually predicted by Simon's theory of resource development, and do not in themselves even count as costs (as pollution does). E.g., he pointed out that due to increased efficiency, the amount of cropland required and actually used to grow food for each person has decreased over time and is likely to continue to do so (p.5). The same might potentially be true of decreased reliance on firewood in developing countries, and per capita use of specific food sources like rice, wheat, and fish, if economic development makes a diverse range of alternative foods available. Some have also proven false, e.g., the amount of ozone in the lower atmosphere has decreased from 1994 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/ozone-trends&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other wagers==
In 1996, Simon bet $1000 with David South, professor of the Auburn University School of Forestry, that the inflation-adjusted price of timber would decrease in the following five years. Simon paid out early on the bet in 1997 (before his death in 1998) based on his expectation that prices would remain above 1996 levels (which they did).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forestry.auburn.edu/sfnmc/web/bet.html |title=The Simon South Bet On Pine Sawtimber |publisher=Forestry.auburn.edu |date=1998-02-08 |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Xuoqlqvo?url=http://www.forestry.auburn.edu/sfnmc/web/bet.html |archivedate=2008-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, when ''[[The Economist]]'' headlined an article entitled, "$5 a barrel oil soon?" and with oil trading in the $12/barrel range, David South offered $1000 to any economist who would bet with him that the price of oil would be greater than $12/barrel in 2010.  No economist took him up on the offer. However, in October 2000, Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, an economist with The University of the West Indies, bet $1000 with David South that the inflation-adjusted price of oil would decrease to an inflation-adjusted price of $25 by 2010 (down from what was then $30/barrel). Madjd-Sadjadi paid South an inflation-adjusted $1,242 in January 2010. The price of oil at the time was $81/barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fp.auburn.edu/sfws/sfnmc/web/oilbet.html |title=The Madjd-Sadjadi South Bet On Oil |publisher=Forestry.auburn.edu |date=2010-01-31 |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608030701/https://fp.auburn.edu/sfws/sfnmc/web/oilbet.html |archivedate=2012-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6119">'''Spectral noise logging (SNL)''' is an [[acoustic noise]] measuring technique used in [[oil well|oil]] and [[gas well]]s for well integrity analysis, identification of production and injection intervals and hydrodynamic characterisation of the reservoir. SNL records acoustic noise generated by fluid or gas flow through the reservoir or leaks in downhole well components.

== Development history ==
Noise logging tools have been used in the [[petroleum industry]] for several decades. As far back as 1955, an acoustic detector was proposed for use in well integrity analysis to identify casing holes.&lt;ref&gt;Enright, R.J. 1955. Sleuth for Down-Hole Leaks, Oil &amp; Gas J.:78-79&lt;/ref&gt; In this class of problems, the efficiency of noise logging was comparable to that of temperature surveys. In 1973, McKinley presented his technique for passive noise logging in which signals were recorded in several, e.g. three or four, frequency ranges at every measurement depth.&lt;ref&gt;McKinley R.M., Bower F.M., Rumble R.C. 1973. The Structure and Interpretation of Noise From Flow Behind Cemented Casing, Journal of Petroleum Technology, 3999-PA&lt;/ref&gt; This method, allowing quantitative and qualitative data interpretation, became common across the petroleum industry.

Over many years, downhole noise logging tools proved effective in inflow and injectivity profiling of operating wells,&lt;ref&gt;Britt E.L. 1976. Theory and applications of the borehole audio tracer survey, the SPWLA Seventeenth Annual Logging Symposium, Denver, Colorado&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=SPE-162081-MS Spectral Noise Logging Data Processing Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; leak detection,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=SPE-161983-MS Leak Detection by Temperature and Noise Logging]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=SPE-161712-MS Innovative Logging Tool Using Noise Log and High Precision Temperature Help to Diagnoses Complex Problems]&lt;/ref&gt; location of cross-flows behind casing,&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, R.M. 1994. Temperature, Radioactive Tracer, and Noise Logging for Well Integrity: 112-156&lt;/ref&gt; and even in determining reservoir [[fluid]] compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Wang J, Alex van der Spek et al. 1999. Characterizing Sound Generated by Multiphase Flow, SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition held in Houston, Texas&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson (1974) described how noise logging can be used to determine effective reservoir thickness.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson W.S. 1974. Field Results From the Noise-Logging Technique, 49th Annual Fall Meeting of the SPE of AIME in Houston, Texas&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical principles ==
The theory of [[sound generator|sound generation]] by turbulent flow of fluid or gas through a single channel has been well elaborated by many authors, while the generation of acoustic oscillations by fluid flow through porous reservoirs is still poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;Hinze J.O. 1959. Turbulence, McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., New York&lt;/ref&gt;  Various physical models have been proposed, including the mechanism of sound generation by transient pulsing of the fluid flowing through pores with randomly varying properties (Zaslavsky, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Zaslavsky Yu. M. 2005. On the theory of acoustical emission accompanying gas filtration by partially fluid-saturated medium, Electronic Journal Technical Acoustics, vol.5 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; This paper also describes the effect of the elastic compressibility of the rock matrix on the noise signal generated by fluid flow. Especially noteworthy among the many sound generation models is the aerodynamic one based on the turbulence of fluid microflows escaping capillaries and entering wider pores (Lighthill, 1954).&lt;ref&gt;Lighthill M.J. 1954. On Sound Generated Aerodynamically: Turbulence as a Sound Source, Proc., Royal Soc. of London&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, all of these existing models are valid and all of the above phenomena contribute to noise generation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3112">A '''subglacial meltwater channel''' is a channel beneath an ice mass, such as [[ice sheet]]s and [[valley glacier]]s, roughly parallel to the main ice flow direction. These meltwater channels can have different sizes, ranging from very small channels of a metre deep and wide to big valleys which can be up to a kilometre wide. The dimensions of these channels are regulated by several factors: water temperature, meltwater volume, debris content in the water, [[ice]] wall closure rates (governed by the ice thickness) and squeezing of fluidized sediment.&lt;ref&gt;van der Meer, Jaap JM, John Menzies, and James Rose. 2003. "Subglacial till: the deforming glacier bed." Review of. Quaternary Science Reviews 22 (15):1659-85.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Glaciology|glaciological]] literature three forms of sub glacial melt water channels are commonly mentioned. 

==R-channels==
The first type of channel is the ''R-channel'' after [[Hans Röthlisberger]] who initiated work on water pressures in tubes under glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;Röthlisberger, H. 1972, ''Water pressure in intra- and subglacial channels''. Journal of Glaciology, Vol. 11, No. 62, p. 177-203.&lt;/ref&gt; These are semi-circular channels cut upward into the ice. The balance between channel enlargement by viscous heating and closure by ice deformation when the channels are water-filled reflects their size and [[Fluid pressure|water pressure]]. He stated the equation 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dp_w}{dx}=const\cdot Q^{-2/11}\Big(\frac{p_i-p_w}{nA}\Big)^{8n/11}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the discharge, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the same as in Glens's Flow Law, &lt;math&gt;p_w&lt;/math&gt; is the steady state pressure, &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the initial pressure, and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the distance upstream. &lt;ref&gt;Walder, J S. 2010. ''Röthlisberger channel theory: its origins and consequences'', US Geological Survey, Cascades Volcano Observatory, https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/39BCA503939401F57BB79A5B0044528D/S0022143000213282a.pdf/rothlisberger_channel_theory_its_origins_and_consequences.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==H-channels==
The second type mentioned are H-channels, after Roger Hooke.&lt;ref&gt;Hooke, Roger LeB, T. Laumann, and J. Kohler. 1990. "Sub glacial water pressures and the shape of subglacial conduits." Journal of Glaciology 36 (122):67-71.&lt;/ref&gt; These channels are similar to R channels, cut upward into the ice that tends to follow the local bed slope but are broad and flatter than R channels. Such channels form where water flows at [[atmospheric pressure]] beneath thin ice and on steep downglacier bedslopes.
==N-channels==
The final type, the N-channel (after [[John Nye (scientist)|John Nye]]), are those incised into bedrock, perhaps suggesting long-term channel stability under some glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, H H. 2001. ''Subglacial meltwater channels (Nye channels or N-channels) in sandstone at Hindostan Falls, Martin County, Indiana'', Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science, 110, 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chemical engineering}}
In [[engineering]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], the study of '''transport phenomena''' concerns the exchange of [[mass]], [[energy]], [[charge (physics) | charge]], [[momentum]] and [[angular momentum]] between observed and studied [[Physical system|systems]]. While it draws from fields as diverse as [[continuum mechanics]] and [[thermodynamics]], it places a heavy emphasis on the commonalities between the topics covered. Mass, momentum, and heat transport all share a very similar mathematical framework, and the parallels between them are exploited in the study of transport phenomena to draw deep mathematical connections that often provide very useful tools in the analysis of one field that are directly derived from the others.

The fundamental analyses in all three subfields of mass, heat, and momentum transfer are often grounded in the simple principle that the sum total of the quantities being studied must be conserved by the system and its environment. Thus, the different phenomena that lead to transport are each considered individually with the knowledge that the sum of their contributions must equal zero. This principle is useful for calculating many relevant quantities. For example, in fluid mechanics, a common use of transport analysis is to determine the [[velocity profile]] of a fluid flowing through a rigid volume.

Transport phenomena are ubiquitous throughout the engineering disciplines. Some of the most common examples of transport analysis in engineering are seen in the fields of process, chemical, biological,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Truskey|first=George|title=Transport Phenomena in Biological Systems|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0131569881|pages=888|edition=Second|author2=Yuan F |author3=Katz D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and mechanical engineering, but the subject is a fundamental component of the curriculum in all disciplines involved in any way with [[fluid mechanics]], [[heat transfer]], and [[mass transfer]]. It is now considered to be a part of the engineering discipline as much as  [[thermodynamics]], [[mechanics]], and [[electromagnetism]].

Transport phenomena encompass all agents of [[physical change]] in the [[universe]]. Moreover, they are considered to be fundamental building blocks which developed the universe, and which is responsible for the success of all life on [[earth]]. However, the scope here is limited to the relationship of transport phenomena to artificial [[engineered systems]].&lt;ref name=J-L-Plawsky&gt;{{Cite book| last = Plawsky| first =Joel L.| title =Transport phenomena fundamentals| publisher =CRC Press| date =April 2001| format =Chemical Industries Series| pages =1, 2, 3| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=huwzAAlNxzsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=transport+phenomena&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false

==Overview==
In [[physics]], '''transport phenomena''' are all [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible processes]] of [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] nature stemming from the random continuous motion of [[molecules]], mostly observed in [[fluid mechanics|fluids]]. Every aspect of transport phenomena is grounded in two primary concepts : the [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s, and the [[constitutive equation]]s. The conservation laws, which in the context of transport phenomena are formulated as [[continuity equations]], describe how the quantity being studied must be conserved. The [[constitutive equations]] describe how the quantity in question responds to various stimuli via transport. Prominent examples include [[Fourier's Law of Heat Conduction]] and the [[Navier-Stokes equations]], which describe, respectively, the response of [[heat flux]] to [[temperature gradient]]s and the relationship between [[fluid dynamics|fluid flux]] and the [[forces]] applied to the fluid. These equations also demonstrate the deep connection between transport phenomena and [[thermodynamics]], a connection that explains why transport phenomena are irreversible. Almost all of these physical phenomena ultimately involve systems seeking their [[second law of thermodynamics|lowest energy state]] in keeping with the [[principle of minimum energy]]. As they approach this state, they tend to achieve true [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], at which point there are no longer any driving forces in the system and transport ceases. The various aspects of such equilibrium are directly connected to a specific transport: [[heat transfer]] is the system's attempt to achieve thermal equilibrium with its environment, just as mass and [[momentum|momentum transport]] move the system towards chemical and [[mechanical equilibrium]].

Examples of transport processes include [[heat conduction]] (energy transfer), [[fluid flow]] (momentum transfer), [[molecular diffusion]] (mass transfer), [[radiant energy|radiation]] and [[electric charge]] transfer in semiconductors.&lt;ref&gt;Plawsky, Joel., "Transport Phenomena Fundamentals." Marcel Dekker Inc.,2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alonso &amp; Finn. "Physics." Addison Wesley,1992. Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deen, William M. "Analysis of Transport Phenomena." Oxford University Press. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Ziman, ''Electrons and Phonons: The Theory of Transport Phenomena in Solids (Oxford Classic Texts in the Physical Sciences)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Transport phenomena have wide application. For example, in [[solid state physics]], the motion and interaction of electrons, holes and [[phonons]] are studied under "transport phenomena". Another example is in [[biomedical engineering]], where some transport phenomena of interest are [[thermoregulation]], [[perfusion]], and [[microfluidics]]. In [[chemical engineering]], transport phenomena are studied in [[nuclear reactor|reactor design]], analysis of molecular or diffusive transport mechanisms, and [[metallurgy]].

The transport of mass, energy, and momentum can be affected by the presence of external sources:
* An odor dissipates more slowly (and may intensify) when the source of the odor remains present.
* The rate of cooling of a solid that is conducting heat depends on whether a heat source is applied.
* The [[gravitational force]] acting on a rain drop counteracts the resistance or [[drag (physics)|drag]] imparted by the surrounding air.

==Commonalities among phenomena==
An important principle in the study of transport phenomena is analogy between [[phenomena]].

===Diffusion===
There are some notable similarities in equations for momentum, energy, and mass transfer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; which can all be transported by [[diffusion]], as illustrated by the following examples:
* Mass: the spreading and [[dissipation]] of odors in air is an example of mass diffusion.
* Energy: the conduction of heat in a solid material is an example of [[heat diffusion]].
* Momentum: the [[drag (physics)|drag]] experienced by a rain drop as it falls in the atmosphere is an example of [[momentum diffusion]] (the rain drop loses momentum to the surrounding air through viscous stresses and decelerates).

The molecular transfer equations of [[Newtonian fluid|Newton's law]] for fluid momentum, [[Heat conduction|Fourier's law]] for heat, and [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's law]] for mass are very similar.  One can convert from one transfer coefficient to another in order to compare all three different transport phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas, William J. "Introduction to Transport Phenomena." Prentice Hall: Upper Saddle River, NJ, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

A great deal of effort has been devoted in the literature to developing analogies among these three transport processes for [[turbulent]] transfer so as to allow prediction of one from any of the others. The [[Reynolds analogy]] assumes that the turbulent diffusivities are all equal and that the molecular diffusivities of momentum (μ/ρ) and mass (D&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;) are negligible compared to the turbulent diffusivities. When liquids are present and/or drag is present, the analogy is not valid. Other analogies, such as [[Theodore von Kármán|von Karman]]'s and [[Ludwig Prandtl|Prandtl]]'s, usually result in poor relations.

The most successful and most widely used analogy is the [[Chilton and Colburn J-factor analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Transport Phenomena
|edition=1
|publisher=Nirali Prakashan
|year=2006

&lt;/ref&gt; This analogy is based on experimental data for gases and liquids in both the [[Laminar flow|laminar]] and turbulent regimes. Although it is based on experimental data, it can be shown to satisfy the exact solution derived from laminar flow over a flat plate.  All of this information is used to predict transfer of mass.

===Onsager reciprocal relations===
{{main|Onsager reciprocal relations}}

In fluid systems described in terms of [[temperature]], [[density|matter density]], and [[pressure]], it is known that [[temperature]] differences lead to [[heat]] flows from the warmer to the colder parts of the system; similarly, pressure differences will lead to [[matter]] flow from high-pressure to low-pressure regions (a "reciprocal relation"). What is remarkable is the observation that, when both pressure and temperature vary, temperature differences at constant pressure can cause matter flow (as in [[convection]]) and pressure differences at constant temperature can cause heat flow. Perhaps surprisingly, the heat flow per unit of pressure difference and the density (matter) flow per unit of temperature difference are equal.

This equality was shown to be necessary by [[Lars Onsager]] using [[statistical mechanics]] as a consequence of the [[time reversibility]] of microscopic dynamics. The theory developed by Onsager is much more general than this example and capable of treating more than two thermodynamic forces at once.&lt;ref name="onsager"&gt;[http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v37/i4/p405_1 Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes. I., Phys. Rev. 37, 405 - 426 (1931)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Momentum transfer ==

In momentum transfer, the fluid is treated as a continuous distribution of matter. The study of momentum transfer, or [[fluid mechanics]] can be divided into two branches: [[fluid statics]] (fluids at rest), and [[fluid dynamics]] (fluids in motion). 
When a fluid is flowing in the x-direction parallel to a solid surface, the fluid has x-directed momentum, and its concentration is ''υ''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''ρ''. By random diffusion of molecules there is an exchange of molecules in the ''z''-direction.  Hence the x-directed momentum has been transferred in the z-direction from the faster- to the slower-moving layer.
The equation for momentum transport is Newton's Law of Viscosity written as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_{zx}=-\nu \frac{\partial \rho\upsilon_x }{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;zx&lt;/sub&gt; is the flux of x-directed momentum in the z-direction, ''ν'' is ''μ''/''ρ'', the momentum diffusivity, ''z'' is the distance of transport or diffusion, ''ρ'' is the density, and ''μ'' is the dynamic viscosity. [[Newton's Law]] is the simplest relationship between the flux of momentum and the velocity gradient.

==Heat &amp; Mass transfer==

When a system contains two or more components whose concentration vary from point to point, there is a natural tendency for mass to be transferred, minimizing any concentration difference within the system. Mass Transfer in a system is governed by [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's First Law]]: 'Diffusion flux from higher concentration to lower concentration is proportional to the gradient of the concentration of the substance and the diffusivity of the substance in the medium.' Mass transfer can take place due to different driving forces. Some of them are:&lt;ref name="Griskey, Richard G 2006"&gt;"Griskey, Richard G. "Transport Phenomena and Unit Operations." Wiley &amp; Sons: Hoboken, 2006. 228-248.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Mass can be transferred by the action of a pressure gradient (pressure diffusion)
* Forced diffusion occurs because of the action of some external force
* Diffusion can be caused by temperature gradients (thermal diffusion)
* Diffusion can be caused by differences in [[chemical potential]]

This can be compared to Fick's Law of Diffusion, for a species A in a binary mixture consisting of A and B:

:&lt;math&gt;J_{Ay}=-D_{AB}\frac{\partial Ca}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt;

where D is the diffusivity constant.

==Energy transfer==

All processes in engineering involve the transfer of energy. Some examples are the heating and cooling of process streams, phase changes, distillations, etc. The basic principle is the first law of thermodynamics which is expressed as follows for a static system:

:&lt;math&gt;q=-k\frac{dT}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

The net flux of energy through a system equals the conductivity times the [[differential calculus|rate of change]] of temperature with respect to position.

For other systems that involve either turbulent flow, complex geometries or difficult boundary conditions another equation would be easier to use:

:&lt;math&gt;Q = h\cdot A \cdot {\Delta T}&lt;/math&gt;

where A is the surface area, :&lt;math&gt;{\Delta T}&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature driving force, Q is the heat flow per unit time, and h is the heat transfer coefficient.

Within heat transfer, two types of convection can occur:

[[Forced convection]] can occur in both laminar and turbulent flow. In the situation of laminar flow in circular tubes, several dimensionless numbers are used such as Nusselt number, Reynolds number, and Prandtl. The commonly used equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;Nu_{a}=\frac{h_{a}D}{k}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Natural or [[free convection]] is a function of [[Grashof number|Grashof]] and [[Prandtl number]]s. The complexities of free convection heat transfer make it necessary to mainly use empirical relations from experimental data.&lt;ref name="Griskey, Richard G 2006"/&gt;

Heat transfer is analyzed in packed beds, reactors and heat exchangers.

The generator stood for some time in the chapel of [[Aston Hall]], accompanied by a plaque bearing the following inscription:&lt;ref name="thomas"/&gt;

{{Quotation|This machine, founded upon Faraday's great discovery of Induction, was invented by the late John Stephen Woolrich of Birmingham. It was constructed by Messrs. Prime &amp; Son in 1844, and was worked by them for many years, until superseded by machines of improved construction and greater power. It is the FIRST magnetic machine that ever deposited silver, gold or copper, and it is the forerunner of all the magnificent dynamo machines that have since been invented. Professor Faraday, on the occasion of the meeting of the British Association in Birmingham, paid a visit, together with some of his scientific friends, to Messrs. Prime &amp; Son's Works, purposely to see the application of this great discovery in practical operation, and expressed his intense delight at witnessing his discovery so early and extensively applied and so successfully carried into practical use. To Birmingham belongs the honour not only of introducing electro-plate, the use of which has been extended to every civilised nation, but also the honour of first adopting Faraday's great discovery of obtaining electricity from magnetism, — a discovery that has influenced science and art to an enormous extent.}}

==John Stephen Woolrich==
The generator's designer, John Stephen Woolrich, was born in [[Lichfield]], England in late 1820. The second son of John Woolrich (c.1791–1843) and his wife Mary Woolrich (formerly Egginton),&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;Baptismal register, [[St Mary's Church, Lichfield]]&lt;/ref&gt; he was baptised at [[St Mary's Church, Lichfield]] on 6 November 1820.&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt;

In August 1842 he was granted patent number 9431 for the use of a magneto-electrical machine (instead of [[battery (electricity)|batteries]]) in electroplating, and the use of gold sulphite and silver sulphite as electrolytes. He offered to sell the rights to Elkingtons for the enormous sum of £15,000; they declined, and after some heated correspondence eventually, in May 1845, agreed to pay Woolrich £100 initially and then £400 annually for the rest of the term of the patent.&lt;ref name="hunt"/&gt; Woolrich later relicensed the patent himself to use in his own Magneto-Plating and Gilding Works in Great Charles Street, Birmingham,&lt;ref name="hunt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pod1845"&gt;Post Office Directory of Birmingham, 1845&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1849 was listed as a "chemist &amp; magneto-plater &amp; gilder", residing at 12 James Street, just off [[St Paul's Square, Birmingham|St Paul's Square]] in the [[Jewellery Quarter]].&lt;ref name="pod1849"&gt;Post Office Directory of Birmingham, 1849&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at the age of 29 in early 1850, and was buried at [[St Bartholomew's Church, Edgbaston]] on 4 March 1850.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;Burial register, [[St Bartholomew's Church, Edgbaston]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The elder John Woolrich is listed in the [[United Kingdom Census 1841]] as a "Chemist",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite census|title=United Kingdom Census 1841|location=[[Ladywood]], Birmingham, Warwickshire|enumdist=1|roll=HO107/1140/1|page=16|line=14–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the time of his death on 20 April 1843 was a lecturer in chemistry at the [[Royal School of Medicine and Surgery]] in Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deaths, arranged in Counties|journal=[[Gentleman's Magazine]]|date=August 1843|volume=55|page=220|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l_RfAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a particular interest in [[electrochemistry]], and in February 1819 wrote a letter entitled ''On Galvanic Shocks'' to the [[Annals of Philosophy]], pointing out an error in the editor [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]]'s book ''System of Chemistry''. He was granted a number of patents for chemical processes, including one in 1836 for an improved method of producing "carbonate of baryta" ([[barium carbonate]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=List of English patents granted between the 28th of May and the 24th of June, 1836|journal=[[Mechanics Magazine]]|date=25 June 1836|issue=672|page=224|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZY9fAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another in 1839 for producing "[[lead carbonate|carbonate of lead]], commonly called white lead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Patents|journal=[[Annual Register]]|date=1838|volume=80|page=374|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j5FNfdZ8QwcC&amp;pg=RA1-PA374|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
