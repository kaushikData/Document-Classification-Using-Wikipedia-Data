'''Alfred Caldecott''' (/ˈkɔːldəˌkɑːt/; 9 November 1850 – 8 February 1936) was an English philosopher.

==Early life==
Caldecott was born at Challoner House, Crook Street, Chester. His father, John Caldecott, was an accountant, twice married with 13 children. Caldecott was his sixth child by his first wife Mary Dinah (née Brookes). His older brother [[Randolph Caldecott|Randolph]] was a renowned English artist and illustrator. In 1860 the family moved to 23 Richmond Place at Boughton just outside Chester. He spent the last five years of his schooling at The King's School, Chester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grayling|first1=A.C.|title=Continuum Companion of British Philosophy|date=2010|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9780199754694|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/viewbydoi/10.1093/acref/9780199754694.013.0343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 Caldecott went to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] to read the Moral Sciences Tripos and he took First Class honours in 1880. He was then elected to a Fellowship at St John's. He was one of the founders of the Cambridge University [[Moral Sciences Club]] and the first meeting took place on 19 October 1878 in his rooms at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pitt|first1=Jack|title=Russell and the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club|journal=Russell|date=1981|volume=1|issue=2|pages=103–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

After gaining his degree, Caldecott was elected to a Fellowship at St John's. He then took Holy Orders and became rector of North and South Topham in Norfolk from 1895-98. He joined [[King's College London]] in 1891 first as Chair of Logic and Mental Philosophy, then later as Chair of Mental and Moral Philosophy.  He developed a syllabus with a renewed emphasis on theological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Michael|last2=Johnson|first2=Andrew|last3=Papineau|first3=David|title=Philosophy at King’s College London – a  History|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/philosophy/about/historyphilosophy.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Dean of King's College from 1913–17; and Prebendary of St Paul's from 1915 to 1935.

Caldecott wrote several books on religious subjects including: ''English Colonialism and the Empire'' (1891)and ''The Philosophy of Religion in England and America'' (1901). He also collaborated with his brother Randolph on one book: ''Aesop's Fables'' (1883).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caldecott|first1=Randolph|title=Aesop's Fables|date=1883|publisher=Macmillan|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007696266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contained his translation of Aesop from the original Greek.

In 1910 he made up a deputation with [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]] and [[Louisa Garrett Anderson]] who were allowed to put forward the case, for women to have the vote, to the Prime Minister.

He died on 8 February 1936, aged 85, at Malvern.

A portrait of Alfred painted by his brother Randolph Caldecott hangs in the Liverpool Academy of Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liverpool Academy of Arts|url=http://www.la-art.co.uk|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Altar Wings of Roudníky - Right wing - Inner part.jpg|thumb|Right wing]]
'''''Altar Wings of Roudníky''''' are two surviving wings of [[Gothic architecture|late Gothic]] [[retable]], which probably originated in one of Prague's contemporary workshops for village ([[Utraquist]]) parish church.&lt;ref&gt;Wenceslas in Roudníky u Chabařovic (dist. Usti n / Labem).&lt;/ref&gt; The altar wings exhibited at the Hussite Museum in Tabor have the status of a national cultural monument. These are the two sides painted plates accrued before 1486.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Horníčková K.'' Mezi tradicí a inovací.&lt;/ref&gt; The wings were cut back and secondarily coated with baroque marbling, making reconversion survived the 17th and 18th centuries, since the inside of the right wing is the oldest depiction of the burning of [[Jan Hus]] depicted in the Czech Gothic panel painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/arts/the-art-of-the-bohemian-reformation-turns-spotlight-on-lesser-known-period-of-art|title=Radio Prague -|website=www.radio.cz|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to be a fragment of an [[altarpiece]], which has not survived. The anonymous painter portrayed "Crucifixion" and "The Last Supper", possibly in monstrance with the body of the Lord.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Royt, J.'' In: ''Gotické deskové malířství v severozápadních a severních Čechách 1340-1550'' (J. Royt, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the fact that both wing plates are shown, it is assumed that the patron was [[Jakoubek of Vřesovice]], a Hussite captain, from Roudníky and his son John.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

== Description ==
Each of the truncated wing plates has dimensions of 162 x 68&amp;nbsp;cm, framed 179 x 82&amp;nbsp;cm. The inner side of the left wing appears at the top of the ''Beheading of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James the Greater]]'', while at the bottom is shown the Burning of [[Lawrence of Rome|St. Lawrence]]. The ''Beheading of St. James'' depicts two figures in discussion, one of which with a headdress in brocade in the form of a miter, the high priest [[Abiathar]]. The figure is a reference to the prelates who Hus condemned. In the lower part shows the ''death of St. Lawrence'', while the figure on the right is identifiable with the [[Decius|Emperor Decius]]. On the outer side of the plate is left St. James the Greater pilgrim's staff and St. Lawrence deacon holding the book and palm branch. Contralateral altar wing (board 2 inv. No. 4336) has on the inside at the top of ''Passion of Sebastian'', in the lower half of the burning of Jan Hus. On the outside is depicted [[James the Less|St. James the Less]], at the bottom of [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen]] deacon. While the martyrdom of St. Sebastian depicts the [[Diocletian|Emperor Diocletian]] (left figure with a crown on his head), the "Burning" is dominated by the figure of a man with a princely cap. This represents Rhine Louis of Wittelsbach, which Sigismund handed Hus over to death. On the altar, cover it and Jan Hus assigned to prvomučedníkům Christian church – St. James, Vol. Sebastian and St. Lawrence. The fact that the left bottom plate is shown "baking" St. Lawrence, while on the right wing is depicted the "burning of Jan Hus", is not accidental. These are parallels between the forms of martyrdom of the saints.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Dating ==
The altar wings are not dated nor signed. The time of their creation can be inferred either by comparing to the manuscript painters in contemporary context, or biographical content of the patron of the altar. Jaromir Pešina states that the author of the piece was in contact with [[St. George's altar]], whose work dates to early in the second half of the 15th century, newly assigned to Czech [[International Gothic|late Gothic]] panel painting.&lt;ref&gt;Pešina J. ''Desková malba''.&lt;/ref&gt; Milena Bartlová considered the painter as a member of the Prague workshop environment with knowledge of the [[Nuremberg masters]] ([[Hans Pleydenwurff]]) and Brussels patterns ([[Dirck Bouts]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bartlová M. ''Upálení sv.''&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Royt states that the artist who painted panels was aware of the [[Wrocław Master]] painting in the [[altar of St. Barbara]],&lt;ref&gt;Dobrzeniecki T. ''A Central Panel of a Pentaptych (The legend of S. Barbara)''.&lt;/ref&gt; which could be instrumental in these Western European influences. These conjectures allow dating the genesis of the retable in 1470 to 1480s. In the event that the purchaser of the altar was a Hussite captain Jakoubek of Vřesovice, who died in 1467, dating emergence retable it can be shifted to the 1460s. [[The Church of St. Wenceslas (Roudníky)]], for whose altar it was intended, is already mentioned as a parish in 1352, and was rebuilt in the [[Gothic style]] in 1486.

== The wings' fate ==
In 1966, during restoration of the village church, students of the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Prague]] discovered two door panels on which were concealed, beneath overpainting, a baroque quality pre-medieval painting dating to the 1470s. Restoration of the original painted panels was done by Bohuslav and Ludmila Slaný in 1975. The last conservation and restoration work on both boards conducted by academic painter Naděžda Mašková and Miroslav Křížek in the year 2013/14. The altar wings were bought from the [[Trmice parish]] in the [[Diocese of Litomerice]] for the amount of CZK 12 million paid from the funds of the [[Ministry of Culture]] of the [[Czech Republic]]. Today it is one of the most important artistic artefacts, in the [[Hussite Museum]] in [[Tábor]].

== Art-historical importance ==
The finding of altar wings of Roudniky became one of the few documented [[Utraquist]] works in the development of painting in [[Bohemia]] after a period of stagnation on topics and painting techniques at the time of [[George of Poděbrady]]. It was a diversion in Prague acting "Master of St. George's altar" from a conservative home environment{{huh?|date=July 2018|reason=Seems to be mistranslated - the context is totally inappropriate for this phrase to make sense}} and the influence of Nuremberg painting from the mid-15th century, which influenced the anonymous Master. The Roudniky panels also likely originate from the Prague workshop environment.

The meaning of the altar wings of Roudniky lies in their [[iconography]]. Illustrations of Jan Hus as a holy martyr are captured in their oldest form, as we know from the few surviving fragments of altars from the middle of the 15th century.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; This monumental painting presents us with Jan Hus as a man of small stature with a round face, beardless, dressed in a liturgical white shirt. His representation with other religious saints assigns him to providence, and the founding legitimacy of the early church. Utraquists needed to present their own saint, with the traditional saints, as one of the reasons their relationship to the paintings had religious themes.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; 
Conversely the painting served as a means of spreading reform ideas, but had a didactic function for laymen unfamiliar with iconography.&lt;ref&gt;Studničková, M. ''Kališnická ikonografie a dobová zpodobnění M. Jana Husa''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
The altar wings of Roudniky was exhibited in the Teresian Wing of the Old Royal Palace at [[Prague Castle]] in the exhibition "[[Jan Hus]] 1415–2005" (30 June – 25 September 2005). Again, the two boards exhibited in the Imperial Stables at Prague Castle during the exhibition "Art of the Czech Reformation", which took place from 16 December 2009 to 4 April 2010. The new acquisition exhibiting an altar wing of the Hussite Museum in Tabor in February 2009, which is got into professional care at the end of 2012. the last two altar slabs enriched the exhibition "Prague Hus and the Hussite 1415–2015", which was held in the [[Clam-Gallas Palace]] in Prague from 25 September 2015 and 24 January 2016.

'''''An Essay on Liberation''''' is a 1969 book by the [[Frankfurt School]] philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]].

==Summary==
Marcuse argues that advanced industrial society has rendered the traditional conception of human freedom obsolete, and outlines new possibilities for contemporary human liberation.

==Reception==
Brian Easlea writes that Marcuse, having in the past been attacked by Marxists for his "quite unambiguous indictment of science and perhaps feeling that he had directed too much attention away from the rulers of advanced industrial society", apparently "reversed direction" in ''An Essay on Liberation'' by endorsing science and technology as "great vehicles of liberation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Easlea, Brian |title=Science and Sexual Oppression: Patriarchy's Confrontation with Woman and Nature |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |year=1981 |page=25 |isbn=0 297 77894 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Baxter''' (1686/1687, [[Aberdeen]]{{snd}}23 April 1750, [[Whittingehame]], [[East Lothian]]) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] metaphysician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Stewart | first= M. A. | year= | contribution=Baxter, Andrew | editor-last=Haakonssen | editor-first=Knud | title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=2 | pages=1145–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Baxter was educated at [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], [[University of Aberdeen]]. He maintained himself by acting as tutor to noblemen's sons. From 1741 to 1747 he lived with Lord Blantyre and Mr Hay of [[Drumelzier|Drummelzier]] at Utrecht, and made excursions in [[Flanders]], [[France]] and [[Germany]]. Returning to Scotland, he lived at [[Whittingehame]], near [[Edinburgh]], until his death in 1750. At Spa he had met [[John Wilkes]], then twenty years old, and formed a lasting friendship with him.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Writings==
Baxter's chief work, ''An Inquiry into the Nature of the Human Soul'' (editions 1733, 1737 and 1745; with appendix added in 1750 in answer to an attack in [[Colin Maclaurin|Maclaurin]]'s ''Account of Sir I. Newton's Philosophical Discoveries'', and dedication to John Wilkes), examines the properties of matter. It described the one essential property of matter as its inactivity, ''vis inertiae'' (accepted later by [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo|Monboddo]]). All movement in matter is, therefore, caused by some immaterial force, namely, God. But the movements of the body are not analogous to the movements of matter; they are caused by a special immaterial force, the soul. The soul, as being immaterial, is immortal, and its consciousness does not depend upon its connection with the body. He claimed the argument was supported by an analysis of the phenomena of dreams, which are ascribed to direct spiritual influences. Lastly Baxter attempted to prove that matter is finite.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 

Baxter's ''Inquiry'' met rather different reactions. E.g. it was criticized by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in a letter which pointed on Baxter's lack of understand in mechanics&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin [https://books.google.ee/books?id=TdNOAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA479#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On the Vis Inertiae in Matter: In a Letter to Mr. Baxter] in Political, Miscellaneous, and Philosophical Pieces, London: J. Johnson, 1779, pp. 479-486 (accessed 15 November 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;, yet left a lasting impression on [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who said, 'I should not wonder if I found that Andrew had thought more on the subject of Dreams than any other of our Psychologists, Scotch or English'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/an-enquiry-into-the-nature-of-the-human-soul An enquiry into the nature of the human soul] British Library: Collection items (accessed 15 November 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;.

His work is an attack on [[John Toland]]'s ''Letters to Serena'' (1704), which argued that motion is essential to matter, and on [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. His criticism of Berkeley (in the second volume) is, however, based on the common misinterpretation of his theory. Sir [[Leslie Stephen]] described him as a curious example of "the effects of an exploded metaphysics on a feeble though ingenious intellect".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Baxter's ideas on dreams were contested by [[Thomas Branch]] in his ''Thoughts on Dreaming'' (1738).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sydney.edu.au/science/hps/early_modern_science/publications_and_preprints/Sutton_carelessness_and_inattention.pdf |title=Carelessness and Inattention: mind-wandering and the physiology of fantasy from Locke to Hume |author= John Sutton|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Areius''' or '''Areius Didymus''' or '''Arius''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄρειος}}) was an [[Alexandria]]n philosopher of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] or [[Stoicism|Stoic]] schools who lived in the 1st century BCE. He was the "personal philosopher" of the Roman emperor [[Augustus]] for a time.

Augustus esteemed him so highly that after the conquest of Alexandria, he declared that he spared the city chiefly for the sake of Areius.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Ant.'' 80, Apophth. p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' 51.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], ''Epistulae'' 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'' xiv. p.670&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars disagree over whether this was the actual reason Augustus spared the city, as at the same time Augustus claimed he was also doing it to honor the memory of [[Alexander the Great]], and some scholars also suggest that he did it to curry favor with that city's elite.&lt;ref name="ae"&gt;{{cite book | last =Capponi | first =Livia | title =Augustan Egypt: The Creation of a Roman Province | publisher =[[Routledge]] | series =Studies in Classics | date =2005 | pages =87, 179 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=JhYfDAAAQBAJ | isbn = 9781135873691 | accessdate=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Gurval | first =Robert Alan | title =Actium and Augustus: The Politics and Emotions of Civil War | publisher =[[University of Michigan Press]] | date =1998 | pages =70-71 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=qVd4vuhkVqcC | isbn = 9780472084890 | accessdate=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areius as well as his two sons, Dionysius and Nicanor, are said to have instructed Augustus himself in philosophy, and Areius for a time resided directly within Augustus's household.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', ''Augustus'' 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rs"&gt;{{cite book | last =Arnold | first =Edward Vernon | title =Roman Stoicism: Being Lectures on the History of the Stoic Philosophy with Special Reference to Its Development Within the Roman Empire | publisher =The University Press | date =1911 | pages =110-111 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=8w1aAAAAcAAJ | accessdate=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is frequently mentioned by the philosopher [[Themistius]], who says that Augustus valued Areius not less than [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], who is commonly thought of as Augustus's confidant and right-hand man (though it must be mentioned that Themistius was writing four hundred years after the fact).&lt;ref&gt;[[Themistius]], ''Orations'' v. p. 63d. viii. p. 108b. x. p. 130b. xiii. p. 173c. ed. Petav. 1684&lt;/ref&gt;

Others sources state that he was offered the post of ''[[Praefectus Augustalis]]'' (governor) of Egypt, but that Areius turned Augustus down in order to take a post in the province of [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]], though modern scholars have some doubt about this anecdote (primarily because there are no other examples of anyone being "offered" a post by Augustus and having turned him down). It has been suggested that this story was state propaganda to justify Augustus's removal of Areius from the province of Egypt and installation of [[Cornelius Gallus]] as Praefectus.&lt;ref name="ae"/&gt;

Areius was succeeded as "personal philosopher" of Augustus by the philosopher [[Theon (1st century BC)|Theon]].&lt;ref name="rs"/&gt; From [[Quintilian]]  it appears that Areius also taught or wrote on rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintilian]], ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'' 2.15.36, 3.1.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], ''[[De Consolatione ad Marciam]]'' 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus]], ''Varia Historia'' 12.25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Suda]], Ἄρειος, Θέων&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constructive theology''' is the redefinition or reconceptualization of what historically has been known as [[systematic theology]]. The reason for this reevaluation stems from the idea that, in systematic theology, the [[Christian theology|theologian]] attempts to develop a coherent theory running through the various doctrines within the tradition ([[Christology]], [[eschatology]], [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|pneumatology]], etc.). A potential problem underlying such study is that in constructing a system of theology, certain elements may be "forced" into a presupposed structure, or left out altogether, in order to maintain the coherence of the overall system.  

In response to this realization, some modern theologians, especially [[Christian feminists]] such as [[Sallie McFague]], [[Catherine Keller (theologian)|Catherine Keller]], and Sharon V. Betcher, feel that the term "systematic" is no longer accurate in reference to theology, and prefer the language of constructive theology. While not a proponent of the language of 'constructive theology,' [[Karl Barth]] frequently criticized the practice of systematizing theology or structuring a coherent system upon a philosophical foundation external to theology's own internal commitments.

''Constructive Theology'' is also the title of a journal on the subject. A Bloomsbury book series on constructive theology, titled ''Rethinking Theologies, Constructing Alternatives'', is edited by Marion Grau, Susannah Cornwall, Steed Davidson and Hyo-Dong Lee.

{{Sociology}}
'''Discourse''' (from [[Latin]] ''discursus'', "running to and from") denotes written and spoken [[communication]]s:

* In [[semantics]] and [[discourse analysis]]: Discourse is a conceptual generalization of [[conversation]] within each modality and context of communication.
* The totality of codified language (vocabulary) used in a given field of intellectual enquiry and of social practice, such as legal discourse, medical discourse, religious discourse, et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marks|first=Larry|date=June 2001|publisher=revue-texto.net|accessdate=25 May 2011|title=A Little Glossary of Semantics|url=http://www.revue-texto.net/Reperes/Glossaires/Glossaire_en.html#discourse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the work of [[Michel Foucault]], and that of the social theoreticians he inspired: ''discourse'' describes "an entity of sequences, of signs, in that they are enouncements (''énoncés'')", statements in conversation.&lt;ref name=Foucault1969&gt;{{Cite book| author = M. Foucault| year = 1969| title = [[The Archaeology of Knowledge|L'Archéologie du savoir]]| location = Paris| publisher = Éditions Gallimard| authorlink = M. Foucault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As discourse, an "enouncement" (statement) is not a unit of [[semiotic]] signs, but an abstract construct that allows the semiotic signs to assign meaning, and so communicate specific, repeatable communications to, between, and among objects, subjects, and statements.&lt;ref name=Foucault1969 /&gt; Therefore, a discourse is composed of semiotic sequences (relations among signs that communicate meaning) between and among objects, subjects, and statements.

The term "discursive formation" ({{lang-fr|formation discursive}}) conceptually describes the regular communications (written and spoken) that produce such discourses, such as informal conversations. As a philosopher, Michel Foucault applied the discursive formation in the analyses of large bodies of knowledge, such as [[political economy]] and [[natural history]].&lt;ref name=Foucault1970&gt;{{Cite book|author= M. Foucault|title=[[The Order of Things]]|year=1970|orig-year=1966| publisher=[[Pantheon Books|Pantheon]]|isbn= 0-415-26737-4|authorlink= M. Foucault}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Compact Oxford Dictionary, Thesaurus and Wordpower Guide'' (2001). Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first sense-usage (semantics and discourse analysis), the term ''discourse'' is studied in [[corpus linguistics]], the [[study of language]] expressed in ''[[Text corpus|corpora]]'' (samples) of "real world" text. In the second sense (the codified language of a field of enquiry) and in the third sense (a statement, ''un énoncé''), the analysis of a ''discourse'' examines and determines the connections among [[language]] and [[structure and agency]].

Moreover, because a discourse is a body of text meant to communicate specific data, information, and knowledge, there exist internal relations in the content of a given discourse; likewise, there exist external relations among discourses. As such, a discourse does not exist ''per se'' (in itself), but is related to other discourses, by way of inter-discursivity. Discourses are also perpetually differentiating toward each other in time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308792484_Quantum_Anthropology_Man_Cultures_and_Groups_in_a_Quantum_Perspective|title=section on inter-discursivity, chapter 10 in Quantum anthropology: Man, cultures, and groups in a quantum perspective|last=Trnka R., Lorencova R.|first=|publisher=Charles University Karolinum Press|year=2016|isbn=978-80-246-3470-8|location=Prague|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meeting the Universe halfway: Quantum physics and entanglement of matter and meaning|last=Barad, K.|first=|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, in the course of [[Research|intellectual enquiry]], the discourse among researchers features the questions and answers of ''What is ...?'' and ''What is not. ...'', conducted according to the meanings (denotation and connotation) of the concepts (statements) used in the given field of enquiry, such as [[anthropology]], [[ethnography]], and [[sociology]]; [[cultural studies]] and [[literary theory]]; the [[philosophy of science]] and [[feminism]].

==The humanities==
In the [[humanities]] and in the [[social science]]s, the term ''discourse'' describes a formal way of thinking that can be expressed through language; the discourse is a social boundary that defines what statements can be said about a topic.

Discourse can affect the person's perspective; it is impossible to avoid discourse for any subject. For example, two notably distinct discourses can be used about various [[guerrilla]] movements describing them either as "[[Resistance movement|freedom fighters]]" or "[[terrorists]]". In other words, the chosen discourse provides the vocabulary, expressions and perhaps also the [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]] needed to communicate.

Discourses are embedded in different rhetorical genres and metagenres that constrain and enable them. That is language talking about language, for instance the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[DSMIV]] manual tells which terms have to be used in talking about mental health, thereby mediating meanings and dictating practices of the professionals of psychology and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine F. Schryer and Philippa Spoel. Genre Theory, Health-Care Discourse, and Professional Identity Formation. Journal of Business and Technical Communication 2005. 19: 249  http://jbt.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/19/3/249&lt;/ref&gt;

Discourse is closely linked to different theories of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[State (polity)|state]], at least as long as defining discourses is seen to mean defining reality itself. This conception of discourse is largely derived from the work of French philosopher Michel Foucault.

== Formal semantics ==
A [[discourse representation theory]] describes the [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantics]] of a sentence using [[predicate logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Muskens, Reinhard. "[https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/180683/COMBININ.PDF Combining Montague semantics and discourse representation]." Linguistics and philosophy 19.2 (1996): 143-186.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Modernism ==

Modern theorists were focused on achieving progress and believed in the existence of natural and social laws which could be used universally to develop knowledge and thus a better understanding of society.&lt;ref name="Larrain, 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal
| author = J. Larrain
| year = 1994
| title = Ideology and cultural identity: Modernity and the third world presence
| location = Cambridge
| publisher = [[Polity Press]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernist theorists were preoccupied with obtaining the truth and reality and sought to develop theories which contained certainty and predictability.&lt;ref name="Best &amp; Kellner, 1991"&gt;{{Cite book
| author = [[Steven Best]] &amp; [[Douglas Kellner]]
| year = 1997
| title = The postmodern turn
| publisher = [[The Guilford Press]]
| isbn = 1-57230-221-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernist theorists therefore viewed discourse as being relative to talking or way of talking and understood discourse to be functional.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"&gt;Strega, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Discourse and language transformations are ascribed to progress or the need to develop new or more "accurate" words to describe new discoveries, understandings, or areas of interest.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; In modern times, language and discourse are dissociated from power and ideology and instead conceptualized as "natural" products of common sense usage or progress.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; [[Modernism]] further gave rise to the liberal discourses of rights, equality, freedom, and justice; however, this rhetoric masked substantive inequality and failed to account for differences, according to Regnier.&lt;ref&gt;Regnier, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structuralism ==

[[Structuralism|Structuralist]] theorists, such as [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Jacques Lacan]], argue that all human actions and social formations are related to [[language]] and can be understood as systems of related elements.&lt;ref name="Howarth, 2000"&gt;{{Cite book
| author = D. Howarth
| year = 2000
| title = Discourse

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the "…individual elements of a system only have significance when considered in relation to the structure as a whole, and that structures are to be understood as self-contained, self-regulated, and self-transforming entities." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| isbn = 0-335-20070-2
| page =17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is the structure itself that determines the significance, meaning and function of the individual elements of a system. Structuralism has made an important contribution to our understanding of language and social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Aaron. ''Discourse and Difference'' "University of New Hampshire Cosmology Seminar" [http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/preceptorial/Summaries_2002/summary3_2002.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Course in General Linguistics|Saussure's theory of language]] highlights the decisive role of meaning and signification in structuring human life more generally.&lt;ref name="Howarth, 2000"/&gt;

== Postmodernism ==

Following the perceived limitations of the modern era, emerged [[postmodernism|postmodern]] theory.&lt;ref name="Larrain, 1994"/&gt; Postmodern theorists rejected modernist claims that there was one theoretical approach that explained all aspects of society.&lt;ref name="Best &amp; Kellner, 1991"/&gt; Rather, postmodernist theorists were interested in examining the variety of experience of individuals and groups and emphasized differences over similarities and common experiences.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt;

In contrast to modern theory, postmodern theory is more fluid and allows for individual differences as it rejected the notion of social laws. Postmodern theorists shifted away from truth seeking and instead sought answers for how truths are produced and sustained. Postmodernists contended that truth and knowledge is plural, contextual, and historically produced through discourses. Postmodern researchers therefore embarked on analyzing discourses such as texts, language, policies and practices.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt;

French social theorist [[Michel Foucault]] developed a notion of discourse in his early work, especially the ''[[Archaeology of knowledge]]'' (1972). In ''Discursive Struggles Within Social Welfare: Restaging Teen Motherhood'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Lessa | first = Iara | title=Discursive struggles within social welfare: Restaging teen motherhood | journal= [[The British Journal of Social Work]] | volume=36 | issue = 2 | pages=283&amp;ndash;298 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi=10.1093/bjsw/bch256 | date = February 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bch256 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iara Lessa summarizes Foucault's definition of discourse as "systems of thoughts composed of ideas, attitudes, courses of action, beliefs and practices that systematically construct the subjects and the worlds of which they speak." Foucault traces the role of discourses in wider social processes of legitimating and power, emphasizing the construction of current truths, how they are maintained and what power relations they carry with them. Foucault later theorized that discourse is a medium through which power relations produce speaking subjects.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; Foucault (1977, 1980) argued that power and knowledge are inter-related and therefore every human relationship is a struggle and negotiation of power.&lt;ref&gt;Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972–1977. M Foucault. ''Selected interviews and other writings'' 1972, 1977, 1980. [[Pantheon Books|Pantheon]]&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault further stated that power is always present and can both produce and constrain the truth.&lt;ref name="Strega, 2005"/&gt; Discourse according to Foucault (1977, 1980, 2003) is related to power as it operates by rules of exclusion. Discourse therefore is controlled by objects, what can be spoken of; ritual, where and how one may speak; and the privileged, who may speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coining the phrases [[power-knowledge]] Foucault (1980) stated knowledge was both the creator of power and creation of power.  An object becomes a "node within a network."  In his work, ''The Archaeology of Knowledge,'' Foucault uses the example of a book to illustrate a node within a network.  A book is not made up of individual words on a page, each of which has meaning, but rather "is caught up in a system of references to other books, other texts, other sentences."  The meaning of that book is connected to a larger, overarching web of knowledge and ideas to which it relates.

One of the key discourses that Foucault identified as part of his critique of power-knowledge was that of [[neoliberalism]], which he related very closely to his conceptualization of [[governmentality]] in his lectures on biopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M. (2008) ''The Birth Of Biopolitics: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1978–1979''. New York: Palgrave MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; This trajectory of Foucault's thinking has been taken up widely within [[Human Geography]].

&lt;/ref&gt;{{bettersource|date=November 2017}} Doubt on an [[emotion]]al level is indecision between [[belief]] and [[wikt:disbelief|disbelief]]. It may involve [[uncertainty]], [[distrust]] or lack of conviction on certain [[fact]]s, actions, motives, or [[Decision making|decisions]]. Doubt can result in delaying or rejecting relevant action out of concern for mistakes or missed opportunities.

[[File:Mr Pipo Think 03.svg|thumbnail|Doubt]]

==Definition==
The concept of doubt as a suspense between two contradictory propositions covers a range of phenomena: on a level of the mind it involves reasoning, examination of facts and evidence and on an emotional level believing and disbelieving

In premodern theology doubt was "the voice of an uncertain conscience" and  important to realize, because when in doubt "the safer way is not to act at all".

==Impact on society==
Doubt sometimes tends to call on [[reason]]. Doubt may encourage people to [[procrastination|hesitate]] before acting, and/or to apply more [[rigour|rigorous]] methods. Doubt may have particular importance as leading towards disbelief or non-acceptance.

[[Politics]], [[ethics]] and [[law]], with decisions that often determine the course of individual [[personal life|life]], place great importance on doubt, and often foster elaborate [[adversarial process]]es to carefully sort through all available evidence.

Societally, doubt creates an atmosphere of distrust, being accusatory in nature and ''de facto'' alleging either foolishness or deceit on the part of another. Such a stance has been fostered in Western European society since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in opposition to [[tradition]] and [[authority]].

==Psychology==
[[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalytic theory]] attributes doubt (which may be interpreted as a symptom of a [[phobia]] emanating from the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]) to [[childhood]], when the ego develops. Childhood experiences, these theories maintain, can plant doubt about one's abilities and even about one's very [[Personal identity|identity]].

[[Cognitive]] mental as well as more [[spirituality|spiritual]] approaches abound in response to the wide variety of potential causes for doubt. [[Behavioral therapy]] — in which a person systematically asks his own [[mind]] if the doubt has any real basis — uses rational, [[Socratic method]]s. This method contrasts to those of say, the [[Buddhist]] faith, which involve a more [[esoteric]] approach to doubt and inaction. Buddhism sees doubt as a negative attachment to one's perceived [[past]] and [[future]]. To let go of the personal [[history]] of one's life (affirming this release every day in [[meditation]]) plays a central role in releasing the doubts — developed in and attached to — that history.

Partial or intermittent negative [[reinforcement]] can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[René Descartes|Descartes]] employed [[Cartesian doubt]] as a pre-eminent methodological tool in his fundamental philosophical investigations.
Branches of philosophy like [[logic]] devote much effort to distinguish the dubious, the [[probability|probable]] and the certain. Much of illogic rests on dubious assumptions, dubious data or dubious conclusions, with [[rhetoric]], [[whitewash (censorship)|whitewashing]], and [[deception]] playing their accustomed roles.

==Theology==
[[File:Caravaggio - The Incredulity of Saint Thomas.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''[[Doubting Thomas|The Incredulity of Saint Thomas]]'' by [[Caravaggio]].]]

Doubt that god(s) exist may form the basis of [[agnosticism]] — the belief that one cannot determine the existence or non-existence of god(s). It may also form other brands of [[skepticism]], such as [[Pyrrhonism]], which do not take a positive stance in regard to the existence of god(s), but remain negative. Alternatively, doubt over the existence of god(s) may lead to acceptance of a particular religion: compare [[Pascal's Wager]]. Doubt of a specific theology, scriptural or deistic, may bring into question the truth of that theology's set of beliefs. On the other hand, doubt as to some doctrines but acceptance of others may lead to the growth of [[heresy]] and/or the splitting off of [[sect]]s or groups of thought. Thus [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestants]]  doubted [[papal authority]], and substituted alternative methods of governance in their new (but still recognizably similar) churches.

[[Christianity]] often debates doubt in the contexts of [[salvation]] and eventual redemption in an [[afterlife]]. This issue has become particularly important in [[Protestantism]], which requires ''only'' the acceptance of [[Jesus]], though more contemporary versions have arisen within the Protestant churches that resemble [[Catholicism]].
[[File:Rae, Henrietta - Doubts - 1886.jpg|thumb|180px|''Doubts'', by [[Henrietta Rae]], 1886]]

Doubt as a path towards (deeper) [[belief]] lies at the heart of the story of Saint [[Thomas the Apostle]]. Note in this respect the theological views of [[Georg Hermes]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... the starting-point and chief principle of every science, and hence of theology also, is not only methodical doubt, but positive doubt. One can believe only what one has perceived to be true from reasonable grounds, and consequently one must have the courage to continue doubting until one has found reliable grounds to satisfy the reason.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Christian existentialism|Christian existentialists]] such as [[Søren Kierkegaard]] suggest that for one to truly have belief in God, one would also have to doubt one's beliefs about God; the doubt is the rational part of a person's thought involved in weighing evidence, without which the belief would have no real substance. Belief is not a decision based on evidence that, say, certain beliefs about God are true or a certain person is worthy of love. No such evidence could ever be enough to pragmatically justify the kind of total commitment involved in true theological belief or romantic love. Belief involves making that commitment anyway. Kierkegaard thought that to have belief is at the same time to have doubt.&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', ed. by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong, v. 1, Princeton University Press, 1992, pp. 21–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Soren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers'', trans. Hong and Malantschuk, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
Most [[criminal law|criminal]] cases within an [[adversarial system]] require that the prosecution proves its contentions [[beyond a reasonable doubt]] — a doctrine  also called the "[[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]]". This means that the State must present propositions which preclude "reasonable doubt" in the mind of a [[reasonable person]] as to the guilt of defendant. Some doubt may persist, but only to the extent that it would ''not'' affect a "reasonable person's" belief in the defendant's guilt.  If the doubt raised ''does'' affect a "reasonable person's" belief, the jury is not satisfied beyond a "reasonable doubt".  The [[jurisprudence]] of the applicable jurisdiction usually defines the precise meaning of words such as "reasonable" and "doubt" for such purposes.

To doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient solutions; both dispense with the necessity of reflection.
—[[Henri Poincaré]], Science and Hypothesis (1905) (from Dover abridged edition of 1952)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[scientific method]] regularly quantifies doubt, and uses it to determine whether [[further research is needed]]. [[Isaac Azimov]], in his essay collection ''[[Fact and Fancy]]'', described science as a system for causing and resolving intelligent doubt.&lt;ref&gt;http://patduffyhutcheon.com/humanist%20articles/asimov.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dragoš Kalajić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Драгош Калајић}}; 22 February 1943 – 22 July 2005) was a Serbian artist, philosopher and writer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2005/07/23/srpski/K05072202.shtml Glas javnosti obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kalajić studied art at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma|Accademia di Belle Arti]] in [[Rome]]. He graduated in 1965 with the highest marks in his class. After completing his training he began living and working in Belgrade and Rome. Kalajić was an accomplished writer beside being an artist (he wrote for the magazine ''[[Pogledi]]''). He was a member of the [[Association of Writers of Serbia]], the Association of Fine Artists of Serbia and the Association of Writers of Russia. He achieved considerable success in the many fields that he ventured into, from literature to visual arts to the history of art and publishing. He was friends with many greats in the fields of art, literature, film and philosophy such as [[Julius Evola]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Aleksandr Dugin]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and [[Gualtiero Jacopetti]] among many others.&lt;ref name=hyperborean&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragos Kalajic: A Hyperborean Biography|url=http://openrevolt.info/2012/09/28/dragos-kalajic-a-hyperborean-biography/|publisher=openrevolt.info|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragoš Kalajić (1943-)|url=http://www.invaluable.com/artist/kalajic-dragos-pcednzs33c|publisher=invaluable.com|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=fn_F3uZ7DTEC&amp;pg=PA207|page=207|title=Serbian Dreambook|author=Marko Živković|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Environmental Values''''' started as a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] closely associated with the [[ecological economics]] movement, but also firmly based in [[applied ethics]]. Subjects covered are [[philosophy]], [[economics]], politics, [[sociology]], geography, anthropology, ecology, and other disciplines, which relate to the present and future environment of human beings and other species. The journal was established in 1992 and edited by Alan Holland until 2007 when [[Clive L. Spash]] became [[editor-in-chief]].

In 2013 the journal expanded to six issues a year. This was a result of increasing popularity and standing in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spash | first = Clive L. | title = Changes needed | journal = Environmental Values | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | doi = 10.3197/096327113X13528328798075 | date = February 2013 | url = https://doi.org/10.3197/096327113X13528328798075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2015 [[impact factor]] of 1.311, ranking it 14th out of 51 journals in the category "Ethics".&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2016 |chapter=Journals Ranked by Impact: Ethics |title=2015 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Social Sciences |series=[[Web of Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''{{lang|la|Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium}}''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Moral Letters to [[Lucilius Junior|Lucilius]]"), also known as the '''''Moral Epistles''''', is a collection of 124 letters which were written by [[Seneca the Younger]] at the end of his life, during his retirement, and written after he had worked for the Emperor [[Nero]] for more than ten years. They are addressed to [[Lucilius Junior|Lucilius]], the then [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]] of [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], although he is known only through Seneca's writings. Regardless of how Seneca and Lucilius actually corresponded, it is clear that Seneca crafted the letters with a broad readership in mind.

The letters often begin with an observation on daily life before proceeding to an issue or principle that is abstracted from it. The result is a diary or handbook of philosophical meditations. The letters focus on many traditional themes of [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]] such as the contempt of death, the stout-heartedness of the sage, and virtue as the supreme good.

==Writing==
The ''Letters'' were probably written in the last three years of Seneca's life. It is generally agreed that the letters are arranged in the order in which they were written.&lt;ref name="sataioli193"&gt;{{Harvnb|Setaioli|2013|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; In letter 8 Seneca alludes to his retirement from public life which is thought (by reference to Tacitus ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' xiv. 52–6) to have been around spring 62.&lt;ref name="sataioli1912"&gt;{{Harvnb|Setaioli|2013|pp=191-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letter 18 was written in December in the run-up to the [[Saturnalia]]. Letter 23 refers to a cold spring, presumably in 63.&lt;ref name="sataioli1912"/&gt; Letter 67 refers to the end of a cold spring and is thought (in order to allow forty-three intervening letters to be written) to have been written the following year.&lt;ref name="sataioli1912"/&gt; Letter 91 refers to the great fire of [[Lugdunum]] (Lyon) which took place in the late summer of 64.&lt;ref name="sataioli1912"/&gt; Letter 122 refers to the shrinking daylight hours of autumn.&lt;ref name="fanthamxxii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fantham|2010|p=xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other chronologies are possible; in particular if letters 23 and 67 refer to the same spring then this can reduce the timescale by a full year.&lt;ref name="sataioli1912"/&gt;

The 124 letters are arranged in twenty manuscript volumes, but the collection is not complete.&lt;ref name="sataioli198"&gt;{{Harvnb|Setaioli|2013|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aulus Gellius]] (mid-2nd-century) quotes an extract from the "twenty-second book", so some letters are missing.&lt;ref name="gravlong6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|Long|2015|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However since the fire of Lyon mentioned in letter 91 took place less than a year before Seneca's death (in spring 65) the number of missing letters is not thought to be very many.&lt;ref name="gravlong6"/&gt;

Collectively the letters constitute Seneca's longest work.&lt;ref name="gravlong6"/&gt; Although addressed to Lucilius, the letters take the form of open letters,&lt;ref name="sataioli194"&gt;{{Harvnb|Setaioli|2013|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are clearly written with a wider readership in mind.&lt;ref name="gravlong4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|Long|2015|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Epistle|epistolary genre]] was well-established in Seneca's time.&lt;ref name="sataioli196"&gt;{{Harvnb|Setaioli|2013|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca refers to Cicero's [[Epistulae ad Atticum|letters to Atticus]] and the letters of [[Epicurus]], and he was probably familiar with the [[Epistles (Plato)|letters of Plato]] and the [[Epistles (Horace)|epistles of Horace]].&lt;ref name="sataioli195"&gt;{{Harvnb|Setaioli|2013|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the careful literary crafting, there is no obvious reason to doubt that they are real letters.&lt;ref name="sataioli193"&gt;{{Harvnb|Setaioli|2013|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca often says that he is writing in response to a letter from Lucilius, although there is unlikely to have been a strict back-and-forth exchange of letters.&lt;ref name="fanthamxxi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fantham|2010|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if both writers had access to the imperial mail service, a letter from central Italy to Sicily would have taken four to eight days to travel.&lt;ref name="fanthamxxi"/&gt; In many instances Seneca probably composed letters as a new subject occurred to him.&lt;ref name="fanthamxxi"/&gt; On average the letters tend to become longer over time,&lt;ref name="sataioli198"/&gt; and the later letters focus increasingly on theoretical questions.&lt;ref name="sataioli192"/&gt; However even in the later letters Seneca continues to include letters that are very short.&lt;ref name="gravlong5"/&gt;

==Content==
[[File:Seneca - Epistolae ad Lucilium, MCCCCLXXXXIIII a di XIIII di Aprile - 544792.jpg|thumb|right|Printed edition in the Italian ([[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]) vernacular. 1494]]
These letters all start with the phrase "''Seneca Lucilio suo salutem''" ("Seneca greets his Lucilius") and end with the word "''Vale''" ("Farewell"). In these letters, Seneca gives Lucilius advice on how to become a more devoted [[Stoicism|Stoic]]. Some of the letters include "On Noise" and "Asthma". Others include letters on "the influence of the masses" and "how to deal with one's slaves". Although they deal with Seneca's personal style of Stoic philosophy, they also give us valuable insights into daily life in ancient Rome.

There is a general tendency throughout the letters to open proceedings with an observation of a specific (and usually rather minor) incident, which then digresses to a far wider exploration of an issue or principle that is abstracted from it.&lt;ref name="rommy"/&gt; In one letter, for instance, Seneca begins by discussing a chance visit to an arena where a gladiatorial combat to the death is being held; Seneca then questions the morality and ethics of such a spectacle, in what is the first record (to our current knowledge) of a pre-Christian writer bringing up such a debate on that particular matter.&lt;ref name="rommy"/&gt;

Seneca frequently quotes Latin poets, especially [[Virgil]], but also [[Ovid]], [[Horace]], and [[Lucretius]].&lt;ref name="gravlong89"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|Long|2015|pp=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca also quotes [[Publilius Syrus]], such as during the eighth letter, "On the Philosopher's Seclusion".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 8|''Moral letters to Lucilius'', Letter 8]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Seneca's letters are focused on the inner-life, and the joy which comes from wisdom.&lt;ref name="gravlong13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|Long|2015|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasizes the Stoic theme that virtue is the only true good and vice the only true evil.&lt;ref name="sataioli192"&gt;{{Harvnb|Setaioli|2013|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeatedly refers to the brevity of life and the fleeting nature of time.&lt;ref name="sataioli193"/&gt;

Underlying a large number of the letters is a concern with death on the one hand (a central topic of Stoic philosophy, and one embodied in Seneca's observation that we are "dying every day") and suicide on the other, a key consideration given Seneca's deteriorating political position and the common use of forced suicide as a method of elimination of figures deemed to be oppositional to the Emperor's power and rule.&lt;ref name="rommy"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Romm |first1=James |title=Rome's House of Cards |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/masterpiece-letters-to-lucilius-by-seneca-the-younger-a-look-at-roman-government-1394820402 |website=The Wall Street Journal|date=14 March 2014 |accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early letters often conclude with a maxim to meditate on, although this strategy is over by the thirtieth letter.&lt;ref name="gravlong5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|Long|2015|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such maxims are typically drawn from [[Epicurus]], but Seneca regards this as a beginner's technique.&lt;ref name="gravlong11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|Long|2015|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In letter 33 he stresses that the student must begin to make well-reasoned judgements independently.&lt;ref name="gravlong11"/&gt;

==Language and style==
[[File:Epistulaemoralesadlucilium1887paris.JPG|thumb|right|French edition, 1887]]
The language and style of the letters is quite varied, and this reflects the fact that they are a mixture of private conversation and literary fiction. As an example, there is a mix of different vocabulary, incorporating technical terms (in fields such as medicine, law and navigation) as well as colloquial terms and philosophical ones.&lt;ref name="berno"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Berno |first1=Francesca Romana |title=Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium |url=https://www.academia.edu/1125154/Seneca_Epistles |website=Academia.edu |accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca also uses a range of devices for particular effects, such as ironic parataxis, hypotactic periods, direct speech interventions and rhetorical techniques such as alliterations, chiasmus, polyptoton, paradoxes, antitheses, oxymoron, etymological figures and so forth. In addition there are neologisms and [[hapax legomena]].&lt;ref name="berno"/&gt;

==Later history==
The oldest manuscripts of the letters date from the ninth-century.&lt;ref name="gravlong20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|Long|2015|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time the letters did not circulate together, letters 89–124 in particular appear in their own manuscripts.&lt;ref name="gravlong20"/&gt; They began to be widely circulated together from the twelfth-century onwards.&lt;ref name="gravlong21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|Long|2015|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first printed edition appeared  in 1475.&lt;ref name="gravlong21"/&gt; [[Erasmus]] produced a much superior edition in 1529.&lt;ref name="gravlong21"/&gt;

==Legacy and influence==
[[Michel de Montaigne]] was influenced by his reading of Seneca's letters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Carol E. |title=Seneca's Letters to Lucilius as a source of some of Montaigne's imagery |journal=Bibliothèque d'Humanisme et Renaissance |date=1968 |volume=30, 2 |pages=249–266 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/41430068?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103904873161 |accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he modelled his ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' on them.&lt;ref name="gravlong21"/&gt; The letters were a principal source for [[Justus Lipsius]] for the development of his [[Neostoicism]] towards the end of the 16th-century.&lt;ref name="gravlong21"/&gt;

==Quotations==
The tag ''Vita sine litteris mors'' ('Life without learning [is] death') is adapted from ''Epistle'' 82 (originally ''Otium sine litteris mors'', 'Leisure without learning [is] death') and is the [[motto]] of [[Derby School]] and [[Derby Grammar School]] in [[England]], [[Adelphi University]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and Manning's High School, [[Jamaica]].

The work is also the source for the phrase ''[[non scholae sed vitae]]'': "We do not learn for school, but for life".

==Criticism==
*[[Erasmus]] in his 1529 edition raised three main criticisms of the letters.
**First was Seneca's habit of mixing personas in the work, running objections and refutations of obections together in a way that Eramus found not illuminating but obfuscatory.&lt;ref name="fanthamxxviii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fantham|2010|p=xxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Second was the way Seneca, in complaining about philosophical logic-chopping, nevertheless filled his pages with much of that empty quibbling himself, in illustration - prompting Erasmus to second [[Quintilian]]'s objection to Seneca's own standing as a philosopher.&lt;ref name="fanthamxxviii"/&gt;
**Thirdly, Erasmus felt that the letters were more disguised essays than a real correspondence: "one misses in Seneca that quality that lends other letters their greatest charm, that is that they are a true reflection of a real situation".&lt;ref name="fanthamxxviii"/&gt;

'''Hempel's dilemma''' is a question first asked (at least on record) by the philosopher [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]].&lt;ref name=Hempel&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has relevance to [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]] and [[physicalism]] in philosophy, and to [[philosophy of mind]].

==Overview==
[[Physicalism]], in at least one rough sense, is the claim that the entire world may be described and explained using the [[physical law|laws of nature]], in other words, that all phenomena are natural phenomena.  This leaves open the question of what is 'natural', but one common understanding of the claim is that everything in the world is ultimately explicable in the terms of physics. This is known as reductive physicalism. However, this type of physicalism in its turn leaves open the question of what we are to consider as the proper terms of physics.  There seem to be two options here, and these options form the horns of Hempel's dilemma, because neither seems satisfactory.

On the one hand, we may define the physical as whatever is currently explained by our best physical theories, e.g., [[quantum mechanics]], [[general relativity]]. Though many would find this definition unsatisfactory, some would accept that we have at least a general understanding of the physical based on these theories, and can use them to assess what is physical and what is not. And therein lies the rub, as a worked-out explanation of mentality currently lies outside the scope of such theories.

On the other hand, if we say that some future, "ideal" physics is what is meant, then the claim is rather empty, for we have no idea of what this means. The "ideal" physics may even come to define what we think of as mental as part of the physical world.  In effect, physicalism by this second account becomes the circular claim that all phenomena are explicable in terms of physics because physics properly defined is whatever explains all phenomena.

[[Carlo Beenakker|Beenakker]] has proposed&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0702072v1 Carlo Beenakker (2007), "Hempel's dilemma and the physics of computation"]&lt;/ref&gt; to resolve Hempel's dilemma with the definition: "The boundary between physics and metaphysics is the boundary between what can and what cannot be computed in the age of the universe".

Hempel's dilemma is relevant to philosophy of mind because explanations of issues such as [[consciousness]], [[knowledge representation|representation]], and [[intentionality]] are very hard to come by using current physics although many people in philosophy (and other fields such as [[cognitive science]], [[psychology]], and [[neuroscience]]) hold to physicalism.

[[Shamanism]] is a system of religious practice believed to be one of the oldest and earliest forms of religion in the world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/shamanism |title=Shamanism {{!}} religion |work=Encyclopaedia Britannica |access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often associated with [[Indigenous people|indigenous]] and [[tribal societies]] tribes around the world, and involves belief in that ''shamans'', with a connection to the [[otherworld]], have the power to heal the sick, communicate with spirits, and escort souls of the dead to the [[afterlife]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.shamanism.com/what-is-shamanism |title=What is Shamanism? |work=Shamanism.com |access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shamans are often regarded as people who can connect with nature and spirits and can often also heal spiritual as well as physical sicknesses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although shamanic practices have differed slightly around the world, the fundamental principles and believes remain the same, with variation occurring in rituals and worship of ancestors. Shamans are often highly respected in their communities due to the multiple roles they play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.56thparallel.com/shamanism-in-siberia/ |title=Shamanism in Russia – Embrace the Ancient Rituals and Traditions |date=2015-06-18 |work=Tours in Russia |access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shamanism is especially associated with the native peoples of [[Siberia]] in northern Asia, where shamanic practice has been noted for centuries by Asian and Western visitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.rferl.org/a/shaman-of-siberia/27992537.html |title=The Shamans of Siberia |website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty |access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term itself derives from a Siberian language, though ''shamanism'' as a [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropological]] term is applied much more broadly to similar practices world-wide.

They have been associated as healers, teachers, scholars and a spiritual guide in the early times of human civilization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com.au/books?id=imfiCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=history+of+shamanism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilhtTr7qfdAhWSOnAKHf-HDRgQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20shamanism&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of Shamanism |last1=Harvey |first1=Graham |last2=Wallis |first2=Robert J. |date=2015 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=9781442257986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shamans are often highly regarded due to the multiple roles they play and is often the one who leads and guides the rituals and ceremonies that take place. 

Historians such as [[:de:Hans_Findeisen|Hans Findeisen]] described it as religion because it contains a set of beliefs, tales, and ritual practices that form a well-organized net of interrelationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Shamanism: Critical Concepts in Sociology |last=Znamenski |first=Andrei |publisher=Routledge Curzon |date=2004 |isbn=0415311926 |location=London |pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there are also those such as [[Timothy Insoll]] who consider the religious label misleading because of the notion that shamanism represented a configuration within a broader religious pattern instead of religion for its followers even in [[Siberia]], the origin of the word ''shaman''.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Origins of Shamanism, Spirit Beliefs, and Religiosity: A Cognitive Anthropological Perspective |last=Sidky |first=H. |publisher=Lexington Books |date=2017 |isbn=9781498551892 |location=Lanham, Maryland |pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conception, according to an account,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; fits what [[Harvey Whitehouse]] described as "imagistic mode of religiosity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Modes of Religiosity: A Cognitive Theory of Religious Transmission |last=Whitehouse |first=Harvey |publisher=Altamira Press |date=2004 |isbn=0759106142 |location=Walnut Creek, California |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[Shamanism]] practices varies across the globe where it is a prehistoric tradition from the [[Paleolithic era]], with cave art some 30,000 years old showing evidence of shamanic practices. The term's origin in the history of Manchu-Tungus and related languages is unknown and this is primarily attributed to the way it comes from an oral tradition.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of Shamanism |volume=1 |last=Pratt |first=Christina |publisher=Rosen Publishing Group |date=2007 |isbn=9781404210400 |location=New York |page=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists, however, propose that it originated in northern Asia, particularly from the [[Evenki language|Evenki]] word ''saman'', which is derived from the [[Tungusic languages|Tunguso]]-[[Manchu language|Manchurian]] verb {{lang|tuw|sa}} (to know) and also related to the same word used by the [[Mongols]], and the ''kan'' and ''xam'' of [[Turkic languages]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2018|reason=Which languages? Neither "kan" nor "xam" are Turkish for 'to know'.}}

There is a theory that the origin of shamanism has a physiological basis on account of the capacity of all [[mammal]]ian [[nervous system]]s for [[trance]] and altered perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=From Shaman to Scientist: Essays on Humanity's Search for Spirits |last=Houran |first=James |publisher=Scarecrow Press |date=2004 |isbn=0810850540 |location=Lanham, Maryland |pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This drew support from the claim made by [[Jean Clottes]] and [[David Lewis-Williams]] that prehistoric humans experienced [[Hallucination|hallucinations]] and performed repetitive ritual activities that affected the consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Flights of the Soul: Visions, Heavenly Journeys, and Peak Experiences in the Biblical World |last=Pilch |first=John |publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing |date=2011 |isbn=9780802865403 |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explain the emergence of shamans. 

Shamanic practices have often been regarded as one of the oldest spiritual practices which have slowly become incorporated into other religions replicated through mystic and symbolic practices and rituals of other religion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Shamanism practices have been found all over the world however little traces of it remain as it has gradually declined in practice and as a religion. Before shamanism faded out it was one of the most widely practiced religions with practices differing in multiple regions however they are all still similar in which the religion revolves around shamans and the multiple spiritual beliefs.

== Historical background ==

Shamanism varies from region to region, country to country as a result of differing cultures and beliefs. As shamanism has been around for so long the exact date of when shamanism actually occurred leaves much to be debated by anthropologists, due to issues with historical preservation and historical accuracy of records. Shamanism is believed to have been around as early as the Paleolithic era or more commonly known as the Stone Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080430093540/http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/clottes/page7.php |title=Paleolithic Cave Paintings and Rock Art in France |work=BradshawFoundation.com |publisher=[[Bradshaw Foundation]] |date=2008-04-30 |access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;In Europe and Africa cave artworks from the Paleolithic era dated some 20,000 years ago indicate that shamanic practices were prominent even during that time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Spirit of Shamanism |last=Walsh |first=Roger N. |publisher=Tarcher Perigree |date=1991 |isbn=0874776260 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to shamanism practices varying across each continent and country there is also a discrepancy in its history however as not enough history was preserved to explain in great detail due to the decline of shamanism as well as various other historical events.

Although there is evidence suggesting that shamanism has been around for 30,000 years and maybe even longer there is however no solid evidence which provides conclusive&amp;nbsp;evidence as to the exact time period on when shamanism has come about.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There is however concrete evidence that shamanism has existed for at least 10,000 years ago due to excavations   
Shamans often play an important role in each tribal society and are often regarded as the healer and also the medium that can communicate with spirits and the dead where they are often responsible for sacrificial rituals where ceremonies are carried out by them and throughout history they were a vital part of each tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.illinoisstatemuseum.org/content/online-resources |title=Online Resources {{!}} Illinois State Museum |work=IllinoisStateMuseum.org |access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Shamanism has slowly started to decline as time progressed and new religions such as Christianity came in and eventually only a few remote tribes still retained the practices of shamanism and one such tribe is the Inuit Tribe in the Canadian Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Jarich |last1=Oosten |first2=Frédéric |last2=Laugrand |first3=Cornelius |last3=Remie |date=Summer 2006 |title=Perceptions of Decline: Inuit Shamanism in the Canadian Arctic |url= https://doi.org/10.1215/00141801-2006-001 |journal=Ethnohistory |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=445-447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional shamanism often involved the Shamans being chosen by the tribe or inherited however as the tradition of Shamanism declined and now replaced with a modern version of Shamanism people can now choose to take up shamanism training.&lt;ref name="Scuro &amp; Rodd" /&gt; Traditionally the role of shamans is one that is often respected and regarded as an elder in the tribe.

In a excavation of a Mesolithic archaeological site, Star Carr located in North Yorkshire, [[England]], evidence of shamanism can be found in the archaeological findings.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://guerillaarchaeology.wordpress.com/resources/mesolithic-shamanism/ |title=Mesolithic Shamanism? |date=2012-06-08 |work=Guerilla Archaeology |access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mesolithic period or otherwise known as the Middle Stone Age dates between 10,000 BC and 4000 BC.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.britannica.com/event/Mesolithic-Period |title=Mesolithic Period {{!}} prehistoric period |work=Encyclopaedia Britannica |access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Star Carr excavation site they found twenty one adult red deer skull parts where there was evidence that these skull parts was deliberately carved and shaped to make it possible for them to be worn on the head of humans with archaeologists suggesting these were used on special occasions or for shamanic practices.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This was suggested due to the fact that a characteristic part of shamanic rituals was the headdress's seen on shamans as part of the ceremonial costume where is was believed that headdresses had the effect of increasing concentration in shamans when they are in meditation or performing spiritual ceremonies.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; To this day Star Carr plays a vital role in understanding the history of shamanism especially from a western point of view due to limited historical records as they have not been able to be preserved throughout time.

Not only in England but costume has played a key role in shamanic practices as it is believed to allow one to better integrate themselves with the spiritual world and the nature around them with many archaeologists suggesting that during the middle stone age period natural places like hills, waterfalls and caves contain animistic entities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is particularly so as shamanic practices have traditionally been correlated to the naturalistic world.

Even though it has declined, Shamanism has managed to survive the prosecution of various regimes through time such as other organised religion and Marxist regimes with key principles of Shamanism still present today albeit limited in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Balzar |first=M.

== In the modern world ==
Shamanism has long declined and this is because larger religions have emerged and replacing it. Shamanism has declined mainly due to larger religions coming in and replacing it where shamanism is now often considered as a primitive and superstitious religion which is untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Oosten |first=J. |date=2006-07-01 |title=Perceptions of Decline: Inuit Shamanism in the Canadian Arctic |url= https://doi.org/10.1215/00141801-2006-001 |journal=Ethnohistory |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=445–477 |doi=10.1215/00141801-2006-001|issn=0014-1801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shamanism is a religion that has changed over time and modern shamanism in the Western context is now regarded as [[neo-shamanism]], which emerged in the 20th century. It involves the integration of traditional indigenous shamanic techniques combined with psychotherapeutic techniques of the urbanised Western world where its main inspiration is derived mainly from the indigenous shamanic practices of Amazonian, Mesoamerican, and North American indigenous people.&lt;ref name="Scuro &amp; Rodd"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scuro |first1=Juan |last2=Rodd |first2=Robin |title=Neo-Shamanism |date=2015-01-01 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304036146_Neo-Shamanism |pages=1–6 |access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Harner introduced the concept of "core shamanism" in his work ''The Way of the Shaman'', which forms the basis of neo-shamanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.huffpost.com/entry/neoshamanism_b_976102 |title=Neoshamanism: A Call to the Western Animistic Soul |work=[[Huffington Post]] |access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, shamanism is considered a universal religion something that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries with emphasis on the importance in reconnecting with our spiritual roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy |last=Eliade |first=Mircea |publisher=FCE |date=2009 |isbn= |location=Mexico |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of the counterculture movement where people started to seek to understand more on ones consciousness, spiritual connection and healing, people began to look into the historical roots of shamanism and a growing interest in plant-based hallucinogenic drugs. This gave rise to neo-shamanism in that time period where it started to gain a greater prominence and interest globally. The counterculture movement was a time during the 1960s where youth rejected the socials norms of that era with a rise in women rights, LGBT movement and experiments with psychedelic music and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-was-the-counterculture-of-the-1960s-and-70s.html |title=What Was the Counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s? |work=WorldAtlas |access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a rise in neo-shamanism due to what it embodies about spiritual consciousness and psychotherapy. Neo-shamanism often dismisses the evil and fear that has been associated with traditional shamanism where fear and evil was a core part of shamanic rituals in some spiritual connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120120013711/http://www.ull.es/congresos/conmirel/YORK.html |title=The Role of Fear in Traditional and Contemporary Shamanism |work=ULL.es |date=2012-01-20 |access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 20th century, people began to see shamanism as a form of psychotherapy suggesting that shamanic practices is comparable to that of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Levi-Strauss |first=Claude |chapter=The Effectiveness of Symbols |translator1-last=Jacobsen |translator1-first=C. |translator2-last=Schoepf |translator2-first=B. G. |title=Structuralanthropology |publisher=Basic Books |date=1963 |ISBN= |location=New York |pages=186-205}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Abraham Maslow]] referred to shamanism as an ancient form of psychotherapy, particularly one that supports the view of psychotherapy as need gratification through interpersonal relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Genealogies of Shamanism: Struggles for Power, Charisma and Authority |last=Boekhoven |first=Jeroen |publisher=Barkhuis |date=2011 |isbn=9789077922927 |location=Groningen |pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, shamanism practices have been increasingly studied by medical specialists and psychologists who utilize its core principles to better complement the treatments given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.naturalawakeningsmag.com/Healing-Ways-Archive/The-Modern-Shaman/ |title=The Modern Shaman |access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Psychologists have also done numerous research on the core principles of shamanism and applying it to spiritual and mental well being by using it in psychological treatments. Much research has gone into looking at how spiritualism can help with easing of the mind playing a bigger role in psychology today. Modern shamanism can also be explained in a scientific sense as one that is inherently able to connect with our beliefs on a spiritual level in a certain state of consciousness. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.sharedwisdom.com/article/modern-shaman |title=The Modern Shaman |work=SharedWisdom.com |access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is demonstrated in the case of the shamanic journey where the shaman enters an alternate state of consciousness and acquire knowledge through access to multiple layers of reality.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=t1koDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88&amp;dq=shaman+journey+consciousness&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3i8_mpufeAhWDMnwKHVR6DNIQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=shaman%20journey%20consciousness&amp;f=false |title=The Shamanic Path to Quantum Consciousness: The Eight Circuits of Creative Power |last=Huguelit |first=Laurent |date=2013-12-17 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781591438489}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been considered a psychological technique that has certain similarities to [[Lucid dream|lucid dreams]], [[Analytical psychology|Jungian]] active imagination, and [[Near-death experience|near-death experiences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology |volume=4 |last1=Weiner |first1=Irving |last2=Craighead |first2=Edward |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=2010 |isbn=9780470170243 |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |pages=1586}}&lt;/ref&gt; When applied as a treatment, the shamanic journey allows the retrieval of memory and the causes of problems such as trauma.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

As shamanic beliefs embraces cosmogenic beliefs from a scientific view researchers have considered the idea that various aspects of shamanic trance like healing is involved with activating certain areas of the brain to generate certain somatic reactions.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Albert |first1=J.-P. |last2=Crubézy |first2=E. |date=2005 |title=Shamanic healing in the age of modern medicine |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15903086 |journal=Medecine Tropicale: Revue du Corps de Sante Colonial |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=93–99 |issn=0025-682X |pmid=15903086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking from this aspect it has meant that doctors and psychologists are placing greater importance in the resurgence of certain shamanic practices as it can potentially have large benefits in therapeutic management of social and psychoaffective factors.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

'''''Homo unius libri''''' ("(a) man of one book") is a [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase attributed to [[Thomas Aquinas]] in a literary tradition going back to at least the 17th century, 
bishop [[Jeremy Taylor]] (1613–1667) being the earliest known writer in English to have done so. Saint Thomas Aquinas is reputed to have employed the phrase "''hominem unius libri [[wikt:en:timeo#Latin|timeo]]''" (meaning "I fear the man of a single book").

There are other attributions, and variants of the phrase.
Variants include ''cave'' for ''timeo'', and ''virum'' or ''lectorem'' ("reader") for ''hominem''.
''The Concise Dictionary of Foreign Quotations'' (London 1998), attributes the quote  to [[Augustine of Hippo]].
Other attributions named [[Pliny the Younger]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Quintilian]] or [[Augustine]], but the existence of the phrase cannot be substantiated as predating the [[early modern period]].&lt;ref&gt;
Andreas Fritsch, "Timeo lectorem unius libri", '' Vox Latina'' 19 (1983), 309 ff.
Pliny did express a comparable sentiment. 
"''CAVE AB HOMINE UNIUS LIBRI.''
Never was this old Latin proverb of greater import, never did it convey a deeper meaning than in this, our own century, when everyone appears to have become an "heluo librorum." Since most men seem to know a little of everything and not much of anything, the man of one book, the reader who is intimate with one great author, whom he has chosen for his favorite, who has imbibed the spirit of his model, and fashioned almost insensibly his own mind after that of his exemplar, is, indeed, a formidable antagonist. Pliny tells us that we should read much, but not many books."
''The Stylus'', Volume III, Number 3, 1 April 1885. [http://newspapers.bc.edu/cgi-bin/bostonsh?a=d&amp;d=stylus18850401-01.2.8 newspapers.bc.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was in origin a dismissal of [[eclecticism]], i.e. the "fear" is of the formidable intellectual opponent who has dedicated himself to and become a master in a single chosen discipline; 
however, the phrase today most often refers to the interpretation of expressing "fear" of the opinions of the [[illiterate]] man who has "only read a single book".&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Portable Twentieth-Century Russian Reader'', Clarence Brown, editor (Penguin) 1985, p. 246; see ''[[The Hedgehog and the Fox]]'' for further discussion of this phrase.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==

===Mastery of a single topic===
The literary critic Clarence Brown described the phrase in his introduction to a novel by [[Yuri Olesha]]:
{{quote|[Aquinas's] words are generally quoted today in disparagement of the man whose mental horizons are limited to one book. Aquinas, however, meant that a man who has thoroughly mastered one good book can be dangerous as an opponent. The Greek poet [[Archilochus]] meant something like this when he said that the [[fox]] knows many things but the [[hedgehog]] knows one big thing.&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Portable Twentieth-Century Russian Reader'', Clarence Brown, e  ditor (Penguin) 1985, p. 246; see ''[[The Hedgehog and the Fox]]'' for further discussion of this phrase.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The poet [[Robert Southey]] recalled the tradition in which the quotation became embedded: 
{{quote|When St Thomas Aquinas was asked in what manner a man might best become learned, he answered, 'By reading one book'; 'meaning,' says [[Jeremy Taylor|Bishop Taylor]], 'that an understanding entertained with several objects is intent upon neither, and profits not.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Taylor, ''Life of Christ'', Pt. II. Sect. II. Disc. II. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''homo unius libri'' is indeed proverbially formidable to all conversational figurantes. Like your sharp-shooter, he knows his piece perfectly, and is sure of his shot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=div&amp;did=LITERATURE.0006.0185.0104&amp;isize=text&amp;pview=hide Robert Southey, ''The Doctor, &amp;c'', (1848), Interchapter VII (e-text)]. 
Southey's version of the quote was taken up by [[John Bartlett (publisher)|John Bartlett]] (1820-1905), the compiler of ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'' (ninth edition, 1902, p. 853).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By way of comparison, Southey quotes [[Lope de Vega]]'s ''Isidro de Madrid'' expressing a similar sentiment, 
:''For a noteworthy student is he,
:''The man of a single book.
:''For when they were not filled up
:''With so many extraneous books,''

The writer and naturalist [[Charles Kingsley]], following the tradition laid down by [[Gilbert White]] in ''The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne'' (1789), also invoked the proverb in favour of knowing completely one small area. "A lesson is never learnt till it is learnt over many times, and a spot is best understood by staying in it and mastering it. In natural history the old scholar's saw ''Cave hominem unius libri''&lt;ref&gt;"Beware the man of one book."&lt;/ref&gt; may be paraphrased by, 'He is a thoroughly good naturalist who knows one parish thoroughly.'"&lt;ref&gt;Charles Kingsley, ''At Last: A Christmas in the West Indies'', 1871.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wesley]] invoked the phrase in this sense and declared himself to be a "homo unius libri", the "one book" being the [[sola scriptura|Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;"in 1730 I began to be homo unius libri, to study (comparatively) no book but the Bible." Letter to John Newton, May 14, 1765. He wrote privately on another occasion
:"I receive the written word as the whole and sole rule of my faith..... From the very beginning, from the time that four young men united together, each of them was homo unius libri... They had one, and only one, rule of judgement with which to regard all their tempers, words and actions; namely, the oracles of God."  
Wesley used it more publicly in the ''Preface'' to his collected sermons;
:"He came from heaven; He hath written it down in a book. O give me that Book! At any price, give me the Book of God. I have it; here is knowledge enough for me. Let me be homo unius libri!" 
&lt;/ref&gt;
Like Methodists in the strict Wesleyan tradition of depending upon the One Book, many seventeenth century and modern radical Protestants pride themselves on being ''homines unius libri''. The poet [[William Collins (poet)|William Collins]] in his deranged condition, met by chance his old friend [[Dr. Samuel Johnson]], who found Collins carrying a New Testament. "I have but one book," said Collins, "but it is the best".&lt;ref&gt;Collins' epitaph in [[Chichester Cathedral]] reads, in part:
''Sought on one book his troubled mind to rest, And wisely deemed the book of God the best.''The Johnson anecdote and Collins' epitaph are reported in Walsh 1892 ''s.v.'', "Book, Beware of the man of one".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrow learning===
[[Edward Everett]] applied the remark "not only to the man of one book, but also to the man of one idea, in whom the sense of proportion is lacking, and who sees only that for which he looks".&lt;ref&gt;Reported in William Shepard Walsh, ''Handy-book of Literary Curiosities'', 1892, ''s.v.'', "Book, Beware of the man of one".

&lt;!--The familiar thought was paralleled by the Augustan poet [[Alexander Pope]]:

:A little learning is a dang'rous thing; 
:Drink deep, or taste not the [[Pierian Spring|Pierian spring]]:
:There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,
:And drinking largely sobers us again. &amp;mdash; ''Essay on Criticism,'' Part ii.15.--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Needham]], in the general conclusions to his ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' series, observed of the saying, "It could mean that this man has only read one book, has only written one book, does not possess more than one book, or puts his faith in one book only. The fear that is felt may be on behalf of the man himself. Having read so little he is quite at the mercy of his one book!"&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Civilisation in China'', "50 General Conclusions and Reflections", p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limited success as an author===
In [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[The Way of All Flesh]]'' (1903), a publisher uses the phrase to describe the novel's protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Pontifex, who is a writer with only one commercially or critically successful work: "'Mr Pontifex,' he
said, 'is a ''homo unius libri'', but it doesn't do to tell him so.'" {{cite book|last=Butler|first=Samuel|title=The Way of All Flesh|year=1917|publisher=E.P. Dutton &amp; Company|pages=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Butler also records that his own publisher, ''Trübner'', applied the phrase to him to express doubts in his literary prospect, the "one book" of Butler's in this case being ''[[Erewhon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
''The Note-books of Samuel Butler'', ed. H. F. Jones (1912),  [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6173/6173-h/6173-h.htm#page155 p. 155]

'''Hongzhi Zhengjue''' ({{zh|c=宏智正覺|p=Hóngzhì Zhēngjué|w=Hung-chih Cheng-chueh}}, {{CJKV|j=Wanshi Shōgaku}}), also sometimes called '''Tiantong Zhengjue''' ({{zh|s=天童正覺|}}; {{CJKV|j=Tendo Shōgaku}}) (1091–1157),&lt;ref name="zensite"&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Bright_Field_of_Spirit_Hongzhi.html The Bright Field of Spirit: The Life and Teachings of Chan Master Hongzhi Zhengjue]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ancient"&gt;[http://www.ancientdragon.org/dharma/articles/the_art_of_just_sitting Hongzhi, Dogen and the Background of Shikantaza]&lt;/ref&gt; was an important Chinese [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] [[Buddhist]] monk who authored or compiled several influential texts. Hongzhi's conception of ''silent illumination'' is of particular importance to the Chinese [[Caodong school|Caodong]] Chan and Japanese [[Sōtō]] Zen schools.&lt;ref name="zensite"/&gt; Hongzhi was also the author of the ''[[Book of Equanimity]]'', an important collection of [[koan|''kōan'']]s

==Life==
According to the account given in [[Taigen Dan Leighton|Taigen Dan Leighton's]] ''Cultivating the Empty Field'', Hongzhi was born to a family named Li in [[Xi County, Shanxi|Xizhou]], present-day [[Shanxi]] province. He left home at the age of eleven to become a monk, studying under Caodong master [[Kumu Faqeng]], among others, including [[Yuanwu Keqin]], author of the famous ''kōan'' collection, the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]''.

In 1129, Hongzhi began teaching at the Jingde monastery on [[Mount Tiantong]], where he remained for nearly thirty years, until shortly before his death in 1157, when he ventured down the mountain to bid farewell to his supporters.

==Texts==
The main text associated with Hongzhi is a collection of one hundred of his kōans called the ''[[Book of Equanimity]]'' ({{CJKV|c=從容録|p=Cóngróng Lù|j=従容録|r=Shōyōroku|}}).  This book was compiled after his death by [[Wansong Xingxiu]] (1166–1246) at the urging of the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] statesman [[Yelü Chucai]] (1190–1244), and first published in 1224, with commentaries by Wansong.  This book is regarded as one of the key texts of the [[Caodong school]] of Zen Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Buswell Jr. | first1=Robert E. | last2=Lopez Jr. | first2=Donald S. | title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2013 | isbn=9781400848058 | page=197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A collection of Hongzhi's philosophical texts has also been translated by Leighton.

Hongzhi is often referred to as an exponent of Silent Illumination Chan ({{nihongo|''Mokushō Zen'' 黙照禅|}} in Japanese).

Aside from his own teacher, [[Eihei Dōgen]]—the founder of the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan—quotes Hongzhi in his work more than any other Zen figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Zen Masters|last=Heine|first=Steven|editor-last=Heine|editor-first=Steven|editor2-last=Wright|editor2-first=Dale S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|ISBN=9780195367652|page=119|contribution=Dōgen, Zen Master, Zen Disciple: Transmitter or Transgressor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29699">[[File:CoverOfWhatComputersCantDo.jpg|thumb|Book cover of the 1979 paperback edition]]
[[Hubert Dreyfus]] has been a critic of [[artificial intelligence]] research since the 1960s. In a series of papers and books, including '''''Alchemy and AI''''' [[#{{harvid|Dreyfus|1965}}|(1965)]], '''''What Computers Can't Do''''' ([[#{{harvid|Dreyfus|1972}}|1972]]; [[#{{harvid|Dreyfus|1979}}|1979]]; [[#{{harvid|Dreyfus|1992}}|1992]]) and '''''Mind over Machine''''' [[#{{harvid|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}|(1986)]], he presented a pessimistic assessment of AI's progress and a critique of the philosophical foundations of the field. Dreyfus' objections are discussed in most introductions to the [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]], including {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003}}, the standard AI textbook, and in {{Harvtxt|Fearn|2007}}, a survey of contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus was one of the only non-computer scientists asked for a comment in IEEE's survey of AI's greatest controversies. {{Harv|Hearst et al.|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreyfus argued that human intelligence and expertise depend primarily on unconscious processes rather than conscious [[physical symbol system|symbolic]] manipulation, and that these unconscious skills can never be fully captured in formal rules. His critique was based on the insights of modern [[continental philosophy|continental philosopher]]s such as [[Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Heidegger]], and was directed at the first wave of AI research which used high level [[physical symbol system|formal symbols]] to represent reality and tried to reduce intelligence to symbol manipulation.

When Dreyfus' ideas were first introduced in the mid-1960s, they were met with ridicule and outright hostility.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=211–243}}{{sfn|Crevier|1993|pp=120–132}} By the 1980s, however, many of his perspectives were rediscovered by researchers working in [[robotics]] and the new field of [[connectionism]]—approaches now called "[[Artificial intelligence#Sub-symbolic|sub-symbolic]]" because they eschew early AI research's emphasis on high level symbols. In the 21st century, [[AI#Statistical|statistics-based]] approaches to [[machine learning]] simulate the way that the brain uses unconscious process to perceive, notice anomalies and make quick judgements. These techniques are highly successful and are currently widely used in both industry and academia.  Historian and AI researcher [[Daniel Crevier]] writes: "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments."{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=125}} Dreyfus said in 2007, "I figure I won and it's over—they've given up."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dreyfus' critique ==
=== The grandiose promises of artificial intelligence ===

In ''Alchemy and AI'' [[#{{harvid|Dreyfus|1965}}|(1965)]] and ''What Computers Can't Do'' [[#{{harvid|Dreyfus|1972}}|(1972)]], [[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus]] summarized the [[history of artificial intelligence]] and ridiculed the unbridled optimism that permeated the field. For example, [[Herbert A. Simon]], following the success of his program [[General Problem Solver]] [[#{{harvid|Newell|Simon|1963}}|(1957)]], predicted that by 1967:{{sfn|Newell|Simon|1963}}
# A computer would be world champion in chess.
# A computer would discover and prove an important new mathematical theorem.
# Most theories in psychology will take the form of computer programs.
The press reported these predictions in glowing reports of the imminent arrival of machine intelligence.

Dreyfus felt that this optimism was totally unwarranted. He believed that they were based on false assumptions about the nature of human intelligence. Pamela McCorduck explains Dreyfus position:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[A] great misunderstanding accounts for public confusion about thinking machines, a misunderstanding perpetrated by the unrealistic claims researchers in AI have been making, claims that thinking machines are already here, or at any rate, just around the corner.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=212}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These predictions were based on the success of an "information processing" model of the mind, articulated by Newell and Simon in their [[physical symbol systems hypothesis]], and later expanded into a philosophical position known as [[computationalism]] by philosophers such as [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].{{sfn|Horst|2005}} Believing that they had successfully simulated the essential process of human thought with simple programs, it seemed a short step to producing fully intelligent machines. However, Dreyfus argued that philosophy, especially [[20th-century philosophy]], had discovered serious problems with this information processing viewpoint. The mind, according to modern philosophy, is nothing like a digital computer.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=212}}

=== Dreyfus' four assumptions of artificial intelligence research ===

In ''Alchemy and AI'' and ''What Computers Can't Do'', Dreyfus identified four philosophical assumptions that supported the faith of early AI researchers that human intelligence depended on the manipulation of symbols.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=211}} "In each case," Dreyfus writes, "the assumption is taken by workers in [AI] as an axiom, guaranteeing results, whereas it is, in fact, one hypothesis among others, to be tested by the success of such work."{{sfn|Dreyfus|1979|p=157}}

;The biological assumption: ''The brain processes information in discrete operations by way of some biological equivalent of on/off switches.''

In the early days of research into [[neurology]], scientists realized that [[neuron]]s fire in all-or-nothing pulses. Several researchers, such as [[Walter Pitts]] and [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch|Warren McCulloch]], argued that neurons functioned similar to the way [[Boolean logic]] gates operate, and so could be imitated by electronic circuitry at the level of the neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|pp=51–57, 88–94}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=30}}; {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=15−16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When digital computers became widely used in the early 50s, this argument was extended to suggest that the brain was a vast [[physical symbol system]], manipulating the binary symbols of zero and one. Dreyfus was able to refute the biological assumption by citing research in [[neurology]] that suggested that the action and timing of neuron firing had analog components.{{sfn|Dreyfus|1992|pp=158–62}} To be fair, however, Daniel Crevier observes that "few still held that belief in the early 1970s, and nobody argued against Dreyfus" about the biological assumption.{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=126}}

;The psychological assumption: ''The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules.''

He refuted this assumption by showing that much of what we "know" about the world consists of complex ''attitudes'' or ''tendencies'' that make us lean towards one interpretation over another. He argued that, even when we use explicit symbols, we are using them against an unconscious background of [[commonsense knowledge]] and that without this background our symbols cease to mean anything. This background, in Dreyfus' view, was not implemented in individual brains as explicit individual symbols with explicit individual meanings.

;The epistemological assumption: ''All knowledge can be formalized.''

This concerns the philosophical issue of [[epistemology]], or the study of [[knowledge]].  Even if we agree that the psychological assumption is false, AI researchers could still argue (as AI founder [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] has) that it was possible for a symbol processing machine to represent all knowledge, regardless of whether human beings represented knowledge the same way. Dreyfus argued that there was no justification for this assumption, since so much of human knowledge was not symbolic.

;The ontological assumption: ''The world consists of independent facts that can be represented by independent symbols''

[[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus]] also identified a subtler assumption about the world. AI researchers (and futurists and science fiction writers) often assume that there is no limit to formal, scientific knowledge, because they assume that any phenomenon in the universe can be described by symbols or scientific theories. This assumes that everything that ''exists'' can be understood as objects, properties of objects, classes of objects, relations of objects, and so on: precisely those things that can be described by logic, language and mathematics. The question of what exists is called [[ontology]], and so [[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus]] calls this the ontological assumption. If this is false, then it raises doubts about what we can ultimately know and what intelligent machines will ultimately be able to help us to do.

=== Knowing-how vs. knowing-that: the primacy of intuition ===

In ''Mind Over Machine'' [[#{{harvid|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}|(1986)]], written during the heyday of [[expert systems]], Dreyfus analyzed the difference between human expertise and the programs that claimed to capture it. This expanded on ideas from ''What Computers Can't Do'', where he had made a similar argument criticizing the "[[Artificial intelligence#Symbolic|cognitive simulation]]" school of AI research practiced by [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] in the 1960s.

Dreyfus argued that human problem solving and expertise depend on our background sense of the context, of what is important and interesting given the situation, rather than on the process of searching through combinations of possibilities to find what we need. Dreyfus would describe it in 1986 as the difference between "knowing-that" and "knowing-how", based on [[Heidegger]]'s distinction of [[present-at-hand]] and [[ready-to-hand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}} and see [http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/html/paper_socrates.html From Socrates to Expert Systems]. The "knowing-how"/"knowing-that" terminology was introduced in the 1950s by philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing-that is our conscious, step-by-step problem solving abilities. We use these skills when we encounter a difficult problem that requires us to stop, step back and search through ideas one at time. At moments like this, the ideas become very precise and simple: they become context free symbols, which we manipulate using logic and language. These are the skills that [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]] had demonstrated with both psychological experiments and computer programs. Dreyfus agreed that their programs adequately imitated the skills he calls "knowing-that."

Knowing-how, on the other hand, is the way we deal with things normally. We take actions without using conscious symbolic reasoning at all, as when we recognize a face, drive ourselves to work or find the right thing to say. We seem to simply jump to the appropriate response, without considering any alternatives. This is the essence of expertise, Dreyfus argued: when our intuitions have been trained to the point that we forget the rules and simply "size up the situation" and react.

The human sense of the situation, according to Dreyfus, is based on our goals, our bodies and our culture—all of our unconscious intuitions, attitudes and knowledge about the world. This “context” or "background" (related to [[Heidegger]]'s [[Dasein]]) is a form of knowledge that is not stored in our brains symbolically, but intuitively in some way. It affects what we notice and what we don't notice, what we expect and what possibilities we don't consider: we discriminate between what is essential and inessential. The things that are inessential are relegated to our "fringe consciousness" (borrowing a phrase from [[William James]]): the millions of things we're aware of, but we're not really thinking about right now. 

[[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus]] does not believe that AI programs, as they were implemented in the 70s and 80s, could capture this "background" or do the kind of fast problem solving that it allows. He argued that our unconscious knowledge could ''never'' be captured symbolically. If AI could not find a way to address these issues, then it was doomed to failure, an exercise in "tree climbing with one's eyes on the moon."{{sfn|Dreyfus|1992|p=119}}

== History ==

Dreyfus began to formulate his critique in the early 1960s while he was a professor at [[MIT]], then a hotbed of artificial intelligence research. His first publication on the subject is a half-page objection to a talk given by [[Herbert A. Simon]] in the spring of 1961.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=225}} Dreyfus was especially bothered, as a philosopher, that AI researchers seemed to believe they were on the verge of solving many long standing philosophical problems within a few years, using computers.

=== Alchemy and AI ===
In 1965, Dreyfus was hired (with his brother [[Stuart Dreyfus]]' help) by [[Paul Armer]] to spend the summer at [[RAND Corporation]]'s Santa Monica facility, where he would write ''Alchemy and AI'', the first salvo of his attack. Armer had thought he was hiring an impartial critic and was surprised when Dreyfus produced a scathing paper intended to demolish the foundations of the field.  (Armer stated he was unaware of Dreyfus' previous publication.) Armer delayed publishing it, but ultimately realized that "just because it came to a conclusion you didn't like was no reason not to publish it."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Armer, quoted in {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; It finally came out as RAND Memo and soon became a best seller.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=225-227}}

The paper flatly ridiculed AI research, comparing it to [[alchemy]]: a misguided attempt to change metals to gold based on a theoretical foundation that was no more than mythology and wishful thinking.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=238}} It ridiculed the grandiose predictions of leading AI researchers, predicting that there were limits beyond which AI would not progress and intimating that those limits would be reached soon.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=230}}

=== Reaction ===
The paper "caused an uproar", according to Pamela McCorduck.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=227–228}} The AI community's response was derisive and personal. [[Seymour Papert]] dismissed one third of the paper as "gossip" and claimed that every quotation was deliberately taken out of context.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=228}} [[Herbert A. Simon]] accused Dreyfus of playing "politics" so that he could attach the prestigious RAND name to his ideas. Simon said, "what I resent about this was the RAND name attached to that garbage".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreyfus, who taught at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], remembers that his colleagues working in AI  "dared not be seen having lunch with me."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], the author of [[ELIZA]], felt his colleagues' treatment of [[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus]] was unprofessional and childish. Although he was an outspoken critic of Dreyfus' positions, he recalls "I became the only member of the AI community to be seen eating lunch with Dreyfus. And I deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Weizenbaum]], quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=123}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper was the subject of a short in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine on June 11, 1966. The piece mentioned Dreyfus' contention that, while computers may be able to play checkers, no computer could yet play a decent game of chess. It reported with wry humor (as Dreyfus had) about the victory of a ten-year-old over the leading chess program,  with "even more than its usual smugness."{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=230}}

In hope of restoring AI's reputation, [[Seymour Papert]] arranged a chess match between Dreyfus and [[Richard Greenblatt (programmer)|Richard Greenblatt]]'s [[Mac Hack]] program. Dreyfus lost, much to Papert's satisfaction.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=230-232}} An [[Association for Computing Machinery]] bulletin&lt;ref&gt;The bulletin was for the Special Interest Group in Artificial Intelligence. (ACM SIGART).&lt;/ref&gt; used the headline:
: "A Ten Year Old Can Beat the Machine— Dreyfus: ''But the Machine Can Beat Dreyfus''"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dreyfus complained in print that he hadn't said a computer will ''never'' play chess, to which [[Herbert A. Simon]] replied: "You should recognize that some of those who are bitten by your sharp-toothed prose are likely, in their human weakness, to bite back ... may I be so bold as to suggest that you could well begin the cooling---a recovery of your sense of humor being a good first step."{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=233}}

=== Vindicated ===
By the early 1990s several of Dreyfus' radical opinions had become mainstream.

'''Failed predictions'''. As Dreyfus had foreseen, the grandiose predictions of early AI researchers failed to come true. Fully intelligent machines (now known as "[[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]") did not appear in the mid-1970s as predicted. [[HAL 9000]] (whose capabilities for natural language, perception and problem solving were based on the advice and opinions of [[Marvin Minsky]]) did not appear in the year 2001. "AI researchers", writes Nicolas Fearn, "clearly have some explaining to do."{{sfn|Fearn|2007|p=40}} Today researchers are far more reluctant to make the kind of predictions that were made in the early days. (Although some futurists, such as [[Ray Kurzweil]], are still given to the same kind of optimism.)

'''The biological assumption''', although common in the forties and early fifties, was no longer assumed by most AI researchers by the time Dreyfus published ''What Computers Can't Do''.{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=126}} Although many still argue that it is essential to reverse-engineer the brain by simulating the action of neurons (such as [[Ray Kurzweil]]{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005}} or [[Jeff Hawkins]]{{sfn|Hawkins|Blakeslee|2005}}), they don't assume that neurons are essentially digital, but rather that the action of analog neurons can be simulated by digital machines to a reasonable level of accuracy.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005}} ([[Alan Turing]] had made this same observation as early as 1950.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(7) Argument from Continuity in the Nervous System."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The psychological assumption''' and '''unconscious skills'''. Many AI researchers have come to agree that human reasoning does not consist primarily of high-level symbol manipulation. In fact, since Dreyfus first published his critiques in the 60s, AI research in general has moved away from high level symbol manipulation or "[[GOFAI]]", towards new models that are intended to capture more of our ''unconscious'' reasoning. [[Daniel Crevier]] writes that by 1993, unlike 1965, AI researchers "no longer made the psychological assumption",{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=126}} and had continued forward without it. 

In the 1980s, these new "[[sub-symbolic]]" approaches included: 
* [[Computational intelligence]] paradigms, such as [[neural net]]s, [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and so on are mostly directed at simulated unconscious reasoning.  Dreyfus himself agrees that these sub-symbolic methods can capture the kind of "tendencies" and "attitudes" that he considers essential for intelligence and expertise.{{sfn|Dreyfus|1992|pp=xiv-xvi}}
* Research into [[commonsense knowledge]] has focused on reproducing the "background" or context of knowledge.
* [[Robotics]] researchers like [[Hans Moravec]] and [[Rodney Brooks]] were among the first to realize that unconscious skills would prove to be the most difficult to reverse engineer. (See [[Moravec's paradox]].)  Brooks would spearhead a movement in the late 80s that took direct aim at the use of high-level symbols, called [[Nouvelle AI]]. The [[situated]] movement in [[robotics]] research attempts to capture our unconscious skills at perception and attention.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Brooks|1990}} or {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s and the early decades of the 21st century, [[AI#Statistical learning|statistics-based approaches to machine learning]] used techniques related to economics and statistics to allow machines to "guess" &amp;ndash; to make inexact, probabilistic decisions and predictions based on experience and learning. These programs simulate the way our unconscious instincts are able to perceive, notice anomalies and make quick judgements, similar to what Dreyfus called "sizing up the situation and reacting", but here the "situation" consists of vast amounts of numerical data. These techniques are highly successful and are currently widely used in both industry and academia.

This research has gone forward without any direct connection to Dreyfus' work.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=236}}

'''Knowing-how and knowing-that'''. Research in psychology and economics has been able to show that Dreyfus' (and Heidegger's) speculation about the nature of human problem solving was essentially correct. [[Daniel Kahnemann]] and [[Amos Tversky]] collected a vast amount of hard evidence that human beings use two very different methods to solve problems, which they named "system 1" and "system 2". System one, also known as the  [[adaptive unconscious]], is fast, intuitive and unconscious. System 2 is slow, logical and deliberate. Their research was collected in the book ''[[Thinking, Fast and Slow]]'', and inspired [[Malcolm Gladwell]]'s popular book ''[[Blink (book)|Blink]]''. As with AI, this research was entirely independent of both Dreyfus and Heidegger.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=236}}

===Ignored===
Although clearly AI research has come to agree with Dreyfus, McCorduck claimed that "my impression is that this progress has taken place piecemeal and in response to tough given problems, and owes nothing to Dreyfus."{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=236}}

The AI community, with a few exceptions, chose not to respond to Dreyfus directly. "He's too silly to take seriously" a researcher told Pamela McCorduck.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p= 233}} [[Marvin Minsky]] said of Dreyfus (and the other critiques coming from [[philosophy]]) that "they misunderstand, and should be ignored."{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=143}} When Dreyfus expanded ''Alchemy and AI'' to book length and published it as ''What Computers Can't Do'' in 1972, no one from the AI community chose to respond (with the exception of a few critical reviews). McCorduck asks "If Dreyfus is so wrong-headed, why haven't the artificial intelligence people made more effort to contradict him?"{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=233}}

Part of the problem was the ''kind'' of philosophy that Dreyfus used in his critique. Dreyfus was an expert in [[continental philosophy|modern European philosophers]] (like [[Heidegger]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]]).{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=213}} AI researchers of the 1960s, by contrast, based their understanding of the human mind on engineering principles and efficient problem solving techniques related to [[management science]]. On a fundamental level, they spoke a different language. [[Edward Feigenbaum]] complained, "What does he offer us? [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]]! That ball of fluff. That cotton candy!"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=229–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, there was simply too huge a gap between European philosophy and [[artificial intelligence]], a gap that has since been filled by [[cognitive science]], [[connectionism]] and [[robotics]] research. It would take many years before artificial intelligence researchers were able to address the issues that were important to continental philosophy, such as [[situated]]ness, [[Embodied cognition|embodiment]], [[perception]] and [[gestaltism|gestalt]].

Another problem was that he claimed (or seemed to claim) that AI would ''never'' be able to capture the human ability to understand context, situation or purpose in the form of rules. But (as [[Peter Norvig]] and [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] would later explain), an argument of this form cannot be won: just because one cannot imagine formal rules that govern human intelligence and expertise, this does not mean that no such rules exist. They quote [[Alan Turing]]'s answer to all arguments similar to Dreyfus's:&lt;blockquote&gt;"we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(8) The Argument from the Informality of Behavior"&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=950-51}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dreyfus did not anticipate that AI researchers would realize their mistake and begin to work towards new solutions, moving away from the symbolic methods that Dreyfus criticized. In 1965, he did not imagine that such programs would one day be created, so he claimed AI was impossible. In 1965, AI researchers did not imagine that such programs were necessary, so they claimed AI was almost complete. Both were wrong.

A more serious issue was the impression that Dreyfus' critique was incorrigibly hostile. McCorduck wrote, "His derisiveness has been so provoking that he has estranged anyone he might have enlightened. And that's a pity."{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|p=236}} Daniel Crevier stated that "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier."{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=125}}

He primarily works in the areas of [[ethics]], [[moral psychology]], and related areas such as the [[philosophy of action]], and [[practical reasoning]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Education and career==
Velleman received his Ph.D. from [[Princeton University]] in 1983 under the supervision of [[David K. Lewis]]. He taught previously for more than twenty years at the [[University of Michigan]] before moving to NYU.

He has received [[fellow]]ships from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]].  He is founding co-editor with Stephen Darwall of ''[[Philosophers' Imprint]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophersimprint.org|title=Philosophers' Imprint|work=philosophersimprint.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' an on-line, peer-refereed philosophy journal.  Several of his former students are now established philosophers, including Connie Rosati at the [[University of Arizona]] and Nishiten Shah at [[Amherst College]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

'''Jaegwon Kim''' (born September 12, 1934) is a [[Korean-American]] [[philosopher]] who is now an emeritus professor at [[Brown University]], but who also taught at several other leading American universities. He is best known for his work on [[Problem of mental causation|mental causation]], the [[Mind-body dichotomy|mind-body problem]] and the metaphysics of [[supervenience]] and events.  Key themes in his work include: a rejection of [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] [[metaphysics]], the limitations of strict [[Mind-body dichotomy|psychophysical identity]], [[supervenience]], and the individuation of events. Kim's work on these and other contemporary [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] issues is well represented by the papers collected in ''Supervenience and Mind: Selected Philosophical Essays'' (1993).

==Biography==
Kim took two years of college in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] as a [[French literature]] major, before transferring to [[Dartmouth College]] in 1955. Soon after, at Dartmouth, he changed to a combined major in [[French language|French]], [[mathematics]], and philosophy and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree. After Dartmouth, he went to [[Princeton University]], where he earned his [[Ph.D.]] in philosophy.&lt;ref name="ephilosopher.com"/&gt;

Kim is the Emeritus William Herbert Perry Faunce Professor of Philosophy at [[Brown University]] (since 1987). He has also taught at [[Swarthmore College]], [[Cornell University]], the [[University of Notre Dame]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], and, for many years, at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]]. From 1988–1989, he was president of the [[American Philosophical Association]], Central Division. Since 1991, he has been a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.brown.edu/myresearch/Jaegwon_Kim |title=Kim, Jaegwon |publisher=Research.brown.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Ernest Sosa]], he is a joint editor of the quarterly philosophical journal ''[[Noûs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brown University |url=https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/faculty/kim.html |title=Home &amp;#124; Philosophy |publisher=Brown.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kim, two of his major philosophical influences are [[Carl Hempel]] and [[Roderick Chisholm]]. Hempel, who sent him a letter encouraging him to go to Princeton, was a "formative influence".&lt;ref name="ephilosopher.com"&gt;[http://www.ephilosopher.com/page.php?15]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017192900/http://www.ephilosopher.com/page.php?15 |date=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, Kim claims that he hopes he learned "a certain style of philosophy, one that emphasizes clarity, responsible argument, and aversion to studied obscurities and feigned profundities."&lt;ref name="ephilosopher.com"/&gt; From Chisholm he learned "not to fear metaphysics." This allowed him to go beyond the [[logical positivist]] approaches, that he had learned from Hempel, in his investigations in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind.&lt;ref name="ephilosopher.com"/&gt;  Although not a logical positivist, Kim's work always respected the limitations on philosophical speculation imposed by the sciences.

==Work==
Kim's philosophical work focuses on the areas of [[philosophy of mind]], [[metaphysics]], [[Action theory (philosophy)|action theory]], [[epistemology]], and [[philosophy of science]].

===Philosophy of mind===
Kim has defended various mind-body theories during his career. He began defending a version of the [[identity theory of mind|identity theory]] in the early 1970s, and then moved to a non-reductive version of [[physicalism]], which relied heavily on the [[supervenience]] relation.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, he has rejected strict physicalism on the grounds that it is an insufficient basis for resolving the mind-body problem. In particular, he has concluded that the [[hard problem of consciousness]]—according to which a detailed and comprehensive neurophysical description of the brain would still not account for the fact of consciousness—is insurmountable in the context of a thoroughgoing physicalism. His arguments against physicalism can be found in his two latest monographs: ''Mind in a Physical World'' (1998) and ''Physicalism, or Something Near Enough'' (2005). Kim claims "that physicalism will not be able to survive intact and in its entirety."&lt;ref&gt;Kim, 2005, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; This, according to Kim, is because [[qualia]] (the phenomenal or qualitative aspect of mental states) cannot be reduced to physical states or processes. Kim claims that "phenomenal mental properties are not functionally definable and hence functionally irreducible"&lt;ref name="Kim, 2005, p. 29"&gt;Kim, 2005, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and "if functional reduction doesn't work for qualia, nothing will"&lt;ref name="Kim, 2005, p. 29"/&gt; Thus, there is an aspect of the mind that physicalism cannot capture.

Kim currently defends the thesis that intentional mental states (e.g., beliefs and desires) can be functionally reduced to their neurological realizers, but that the qualitative or phenomenal mental states (e.g., sensations) are irreducibly non-physical and [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenal]]. He, thus, defends a version of [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], although Kim argues that it is physicalism near enough. As of March, 2008, Kim still sees physicalism to be the most comprehensive world view that is irreplaceable with any other world view.&lt;ref name="Kim, Kihyeon 2008"&gt;Kim, Kihyeon, [http://article.joins.com/article/article.asp?total_id=3061770 "세계적 철학자 7명 릴레이 인터뷰 ⑧·끝 김재권 미 브라운대 석좌교수 (Relay Interview with 7 World Renown Philosophers ⑧ End: Jaegwon Kim, William Herbert Perry Faunce Professor of Philosophy at Brown University)"], ''[[Joongang Ilbo]] Newspaper article'', March 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 interview with Korean daily newspaper [[Joongang Ilbo]], Kim stated  that we must seek a naturalistic explanation for mind because mind is a natural phenomenon, and supernatural explanation only provides "one riddle over another".&lt;ref name="Kim, Kihyeon 2008"/&gt; He believes that any correct explanation for the nature of mind would come from natural science rather than philosophy or psychology.&lt;ref name="Kim, Kihyeon 2008"/&gt;

=== Argument against non-reductive physicalism===
[[Image:Figure1.gif|thumb|right|Figure demonstration how M1 and M2 are not reduced to P1 and P2.]]

Kim has raised an objection based on [[causal closure]] and [[overdetermination]] to [[non-reductive physicalism]].&lt;ref&gt;(2003) "Blocking Causal Drainage and Other Maintenance Chores with Mental Causation", ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'' 67.1: 151-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-reductive physicalist is committed to following three principles: the irreducibility of the mental to the physical, some version of mental-physical [[supervenience]], and the causal efficaciousness of mental states. The problem, according to Kim, is that when these three commitments are combined with a few other well-accepted principles, an inconsistency is generated that entails the causal impotence of mental properties. The first principle, which most ontological physicalists would accept, is the causal closure of the physical domain, according to which, every physical effect has a sufficient physical cause. The second principle Kim notes is that of causal exclusion, which holds that no normal event can have more than one sufficient cause. The problem is that a behavior cannot have as its cause, both a physical event and a (supervening) mental event, without resulting in a case of overdetermination (thus violating the principle of causal exclusion). The result is that physical causes exclude mental states from causally contributing to the behavior.

In detail: he proposes (using the chart on the right) that ''M1'' causes ''M2'' (these are mental events) and ''P1'' causes ''P2'' (these are physical events). ''M1'' has ''P1'' as its supervenience base, and ''M2'' has ''P2'' as its supervenience base. The only way for ''M1'' to cause ''M2'', is by causing its supervenience base ''P2'' (a case of mental-to-physical causation). If ''P1'' causes ''P2'', and ''M1'' causes ''P2'', then we have a case of causal overdetermination. Applying the principle of causal-exclusion, either ''P1'' or ''M1'' must be eliminated as a cause of ''P2''. Given the principle of the causal closure of the physical domain, ''M1'' is excluded.

The non-reductive physicalist is forced to choose between two unappealing options: one could reject the causal-exclusion principle and claim that in this scenario we are dealing with a genuine case of overdetermination, or one could embrace [[epiphenomenalism]]. Kim argues that mental causation can only be preserved by rejecting the premise of irreducibility in favor of reduction; in order for mental properties to be considered causally efficacious, they must be reducible to physical properties.

===Metaphysics===
Kim's work in metaphysics focuses primarily on events and properties.

Kim developed an [[Event (philosophy)|event]] identity theory, but has not defended it recently.  This theory holds that events are identical if and only if they occur in the same time and place and instantiate the same property.  Thus if one waves ten fingers, several events occur, including the waving of an even number of fingers, the event of waving fingers that are evenly divisible by five, and evenly divisible by ten.  Some have criticized his theory as producing too many events.

Kim also theorized that events are structured. He is known for a property-exemplification account of events. They are composed of three things: Object(s), a property and time or a [[Units of time#General units of time|temporal interval]]. Events are defined using the operation [x, P, t].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

A unique event is defined by two principles: the existence condition and the identity condition. The existence condition states "[x, P, t] exists if and only if object x exemplifies the n-adic P at time t". This means a unique event exists if the above is met. The identity condition states "[x, P, t] is [y, Q, t`] if and only if x=y, P=Q and t=t`".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Epistemology===
Kim is a critic of the "naturalized" [[epistemology]] popularized by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] in the latter half of the twentieth century.  Kim's influential article "What is 'Naturalized Epistemology'?" (1988) argues that "naturalized" epistemologies like Quine's are not proper epistemologies as they are merely descriptive in scope, while one generally expects an "epistemology" to make normative claims about knowledge. Kim argues that mere description of belief-forming practices cannot account for justified belief.  (He also argues that to even individuate beliefs, the naturalized epistemologist must presuppose normative criteria of justification.)  Naturalized epistemology cannot address the issue of justification, and therefore it does not share the same aspiration as the traditional approach to epistemology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">'''John Alday''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1570), was an English translator of semi-philosophical and classical works in the reign of [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. He was described by [[Thomas Tanner (bishop)|Thomas Tanner]] as a resident of London.

==Works==
The book by which Alday is chiefly known is an English version of two French pamphlets, published in 1558, and it bears the title: ‘Theatrum Mundi, the Theatre or rule of the worlde, wherein may be sene the running race and course of every mans life, as touching miserie and felicity, wherein be contained wonderful examples and learned deuises to the ouerthrowe of vice and exalting of vertue. Whereunto is added a learned and maruellous worke of the excellencie of mankinde. Written in the French and Latin tongues by Peter Boaystuau (i.e., [[Pierre Boaistuau]], surnamed Launay), and translated into English by John Alday.’ London, H. D. for Thomas Hacket, 16mo. The book was dedicated to Sir [[William Chester (mayor)|William Chester]], alderman of London, and verses in its praise appear on the back of the title-page. It is undated, but, having been licensed towards the end of 1566 (Arber's ''Transcript of the Stationers' Register,'' i.366), the translation was probably published early in the next year. The work contains several pieces of verse, and on their account [[Joseph Ritson]] numbered Alday among the English poets of the sixteenth century (''Bibliographia Poetica,'' p.&amp;nbsp;114). The longest piece is entitled ‘A complaint of the pore husbandmen in meter.’ A second edition of the work appeared in 1574, printed by H. Bynneman for Thomas Hacket. From his address to the reader there, we gather that Alday claimed to be the first to use the word theatre in an English book, or to introduce into England the simile comparing human life to the stage. A third edition of the work was published in 1581, and there it was stated that John Alday had ‘perused, corrected, and amended’ the English rendering, ‘the old translation being corrupted.’ The latter part of the book—‘Of the Excellencie of Mankinde’—is frequently referred to by [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] in his ''[[Anatomy of Melancholie]]''. A new English translation of the whole work, by Francis Farrer, merchant, was published in 1663.

An English version of a French summary of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ‘History,’ which was licensed in July 1566 (Arber's ''Stationers' Register,'' i.314), is also ascribed to Alday. Its full title runs: ‘A summarie of the Antiquities and wonders of the worlde, abstracted out of the sixtene first bookes of the excellente Historiographer Plinie, wherein may be sene the wonderfull workes of God in his creatures, translated oute of French into English by I. A. Imprinted at London by [[Henry Denham]] for Thomas Hacket.’ 8vo. A copy of this rare work is in the [[Grenville Library]]. A translation of another French treatise from Alday's pen was printed by Thomas East for William Ponsonby in 1579; it bears the title, ‘Praise and Dispraise of Women: Gathered out of sundrye Authors, as well Sacred as Prophane, with plentee of wonderfull examples, whereoff some are rare and not heard off before, as by the principall notes in the Margent may appeare. Written in the French tongue, and brought into our vulgar by John Allday,’ London, 1579, 8vo.

==Biography==
Born in [[Osnabrück]], Fortlage taught in [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] before becoming professor of philosophy at [[University of Jena|Jena]] in 1846 (1846 associate professor, 1860 honorary professor),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd118684256.html Fortlage, Arnold Rudolf Karl] In: [[Neue Deutsche Biographie]] (NDB).

Originally a follower of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], he turned to [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and the [[psychologist]] [[Friedrich Eduard Beneke]], agreeing with his assertion that psychology is the basis of all philosophy. The fundamental idea of his psychology is [[impulse (psychology)|impulse]], which combines representation (thereby presupposing consciousness) and feeling (i.e. pleasure). [[Reason]] is the highest thing in nature, i.e. it is divine in its nature. God is the absolute [[Ego (religion)|Ego]], and the empirical egos are his instruments.

'''Leonardo Garzoni''' ([[Venice]], Italy, 1543 – [[Venice]], Italy, March 10, 1592) was a Jesuit [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]].

==Life==
The little data we have about Garzoni’s life are the brief notices registered on official documents of the Society of Jesus. From these sources we know that Garzoni was born into a patrician family and that he began his philosophical studies before 1565. About 1566 he joined a congregation near to the Jesuits’ College in Brescia and entered the Society of Jesus in 1567 or 1568. In 1568 he lectured in logic in Parma and in 1573 he was a third–year student in theology in Padua. On June 9, 1579 he took his four vows in Brescia and from 1579 he lived, as a confessor, in Venice. After a stay in Verona (about 1588) he came back to Venice, where he died.

==Works==
Garzoni’s only extant work, the ''Due trattati sopra la natura, e le qualità della calamita'', is the first known example of a modern treatment of magnetic phenomena. Written in years near 1580 and never published, the treatise had a wide diffusion. In particular, Garzoni is referred to as an expert in magnetism by [[Niccolò Cabeo]], whose ''Philosophia Magnetica'' (1629) is just a re-adjustement of Garzoni’s work. Garzoni’s treatise was known also to [[Giovanni Battista Della Porta]] and [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]. Even if the Jesuit is never mentioned, both Della Porta’s ''Magia Naturalis'' (1589) and Gilbert’s ''De Magnete'' (1600) shows a heavy dependence on Garzoni’s treatise. In the case of Della Porta we are facing a blatant plagiarism, as was already remarked by Niccolò Cabeo (''Philosophia Magnetica'', Praefatio ad lectorem) and [[Niccolò Zucchi]] (''Philosophia magnetica…'', fols. 62v-63r).

===Contents===
The first treatise, consisting of 17 chapters, contains Garzoni's theory of magnetism. The second treatise contains the description of a number of experiments, presented as 90 conclusions or doubts, and 39 corollaries.

In the first treatise Garzoni explains the two principal magnetic effects displayed by the loadstone: its tendency to the poles and its interaction with other loadstones, or with iron. Firstly, the author ascertains that the motion towards the poles is a natural one, ascribes it to an internal mover ant its appropriate instrument, which he names the ''qualità delle due facce'' (quality of two faces). The loadstone naturally possesses the quality, or [[verticity]], while iron can acquire it from the stone, becoming magnetized. Iron naturally possesses a similar quality, or 'qualità di una faccia'' (quality of one face), by means of which it is disposed to receive verticity from a loadstone. Once magnetized, iron behaves exactly like a loadstone.
The most interesting features concerns Garzoni's description of the way verticity moves the loadstone and the way it alters surrounding bodies, virtually propagating itself outside the stone. Other interesting features arise from the explanation of double nature of the magnetic quality, and from the problem of the location of the geographical magnetical poles.

The second treatise starts with a classical experiment showing the proper alignment of the loadstone to the poles, followed by a lot of experiences about the interaction between two loadstones, between the loadstone and iron, and  about the transmission of the magnetic virtue. Garzoni then considers the diffusion of the magnetic virtue inside the stone, outside it, and inside iron. These results are obtained by magnetizing bodies of different shapes and sizes. In particular, Garzoni considers the behaviour of magnetized iron dust. The behaviour of iron placed in the sphere of action of more loadstones is salso investigated. In the subsequent experiments, Garzoni studies the external diffusion of magnetic virtue by displacing a magnetic needle within the sphere of action. At every point, the direction of the needle gives the direction of the magnetic virtue. The configuration Garzoni obtains coincides with the one theorized in the first treatise (look at the accompanying diagrams displaying the lines of propagation of verticity). Garzoni then studies the behaviour of two magnetized needles, and he investigates the action of non–magnetized iron, the properties of the quality of one face and the alteration of the quality of one and two faces. Finally, he quickly mentions spontaneous magnetization and the loss of verticity.

{{Judicial interpretation}}
In [[Canadian law]], the '''living tree doctrine''' ({{Lang-fr|théorie de l'arbre vivant}}) is a [[legal doctrine|doctrine]] of constitutional interpretation that says that a constitution is organic and must be read in a broad and progressive manner so as to adapt it to the changing times.

== Concept ==
The living tree doctrine has been deeply entrenched into Canadian constitutional law since the seminal constitutional case of ''[[Edwards v Canada (Attorney General)]]'' also widely known as the ''Persons Case'' wherein [[John Sankey, 1st Viscount Sankey|Viscount Sankey]] stated in the 1929 decision: "The [[British North America Act]] planted in Canada [is] a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits." This is known as the Doctrine of Progressive Interpretation. This means that the Constitution cannot be interpreted in the same way as an ordinary statute. Rather, it must be read within the context of society to ensure that it adapts and reflects changes. If constitutional interpretation adheres to the [[original intent|Framer's Intent]] and remains rooted in the past, the Constitution would not be reflective of society and eventually fall into disuse. 

{{quote|
The "frozen concepts" reasoning runs contrary to one of the most fundamental principles of Canadian constitutional interpretation: that our Constitution is a living tree which, by way of progressive interpretation, accommodates and addresses the realities of modern life....

Lord Sankey LC’s reference to "natural limits" did not impose an obligation to determine, in the abstract and absolutely, the core meaning of constitutional terms....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Reference re Same-Sex Marriage|link=Reference re Same-Sex Marriage|year=2004|court=scc|num=79|pinpoint=par. 22, 28|parallelcite=[2004] 3 SCR 698|date=2004-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

However, "natural limits" cannot be granted too elastic a definition. In the [[Bank of Montreal v. Marcotte|Marcotte trilogy]], it was held that payments by [[credit card]] could not be considered to fall within the federal [[bills of exchange]] power, as there had been no shift in how a bill of exchange is defined in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Marcotte v. Fédération des caisses Desjardins du Québec|year=2014|court=scc|num=57|pinpoint=par. 21|date = 2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charter ==
The interpretation of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] also makes use of the living tree doctrine.  Chief Justice [[Antonio Lamer]] stated in ''[[Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act]]'', "If the newly planted 'living tree' which is the Charter is to have the possibility of growth and adjustment over time, care must be taken to ensure that historical materials, such as the Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee, do not stunt its growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act|link=Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act|year=1985|court=scc|num=81|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 53|parallelcite=[1985] 2 SCR 486|date=1985-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Matteo Tafuri''' ([[Soleto]] 8 August 1492{{spaced ndash}}[[Soleto]] 13 June 1582) was an Italian [[philosopher]], [[astrologer]] and [[physician]].

== Biography ==

Matteo Tafuri was born in [[Soleto]], a small village in the south of [[Apulia]], on 8 August 1492.&lt;ref&gt;Manni, "La guglia, l'astrologo, la macàra" op.cit., p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
In his early years he studied the Hellenic culture through the teachings of [[Sergio Stiso]], a famous hellenist from [[Zollino]], and later he devoted himself to philosophy and medicine in [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;Manni, "La guglia, l'astrologo, la macàra" op.cit., p 103.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1525 in [[Padua]] he met [[Zimaria]], an Aristotelian disciple of [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] and in [[Venice]] he proved his ability of divination to king [[Francis I of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Lanera, Paone, "Momenti e figure di storia pugliese", op.cit., p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year he went to England where he met [[Thomas More]] and the Archbishop [[Thomas Wosley]] but there he was inquired for heresy.&lt;ref&gt;Manni, "La guglia, l'astrologo, la macàra" op.cit., p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
Then he studied philosophy and medicine in Paris at the "[[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]", he attended the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain and travelled through Africa, Poland and Greece. Finally he came back to his native village, Soleto, where in 1569 he was accused of witchcraft and satanic powers by the [[Inquisition]], was imprisoned for 15 months, and later acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;Manni, Lanera, Paone, "Momenti e figure di storia pugliese", op.cit., p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1571 he received a visit from [[Juan of Austria]], a commander of the fleet of the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]] that won the [[Battle of Lepanto]], who wanted to meet the "old Matteo".&lt;ref&gt;Lanera, Paone, "Momenti e figure di storia pugliese", op.cit., p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived his last years in poverty in Soleto, feared and disliked by the people, receiving a pension from the Archbishop of Capua and a support from the “Universitas” of Soleto, which wanted to reward him for his contribution to the education of the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Manni, "La guglia, l'astrologo, la macàra"op.cit., p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
He died in Soleto on 13 June 1582.&lt;ref&gt;Manni, "La guglia, l'astrologo, la macàra"op.cit., p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Character==

Matteo Tafuri was one of the most eminent personalities of Apulia in the 16th century and he remained in the popular culture as a [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] and a practitioner of the "demonic religion".&lt;ref&gt;Manni, "La guglia, l'astrologo, la macàra"op.cit., p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
The magic of Tafuri must be understood as knowledge of natural mysteries through [[astrology]], [[alchemy]] and [[medicine]], which could break the "spell of evil."&lt;ref&gt;Manni, "La guglia, l'astrologo, la macàra"op.cit., p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was defended by [[Father Stanislao]], who said, in his "critical propositio", that Tafuri never practiced the demonic magic and that many powerful and wise men came from everywhere attracted by his wide culture.&lt;ref&gt;Manni, "La guglia, l'astrologo, la macàra"op.cit., p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works and culture==

Matteo Tafuri wrote many works but they were lost by his relatives in the course of the years, and what we have nowadays, except for the "Pronostico", is only a list of names.
He was a great [[astrologer]] and an expert of [[physiognomy]]. According to his contemporaries, he based himself on somatic characteristics to know the future events about a person.&lt;ref&gt;Manni, "La guglia, l'astrologo, la macàra" op.cit., p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was also expert in herbs and medical plants and studied the properties of [[mandrake (plant)|mandrake]] to cause apparent death, he studied anesthetic substances and methods of inducing sleep (contained in the "somnibus" and "de insomniandi artificial")&lt;ref&gt;Lanera, Paone, "Momenti e figure di storia pugliese", op.cit., p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; and he has likely used the "treacle", an alchemical medicine, to cure sick people when the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] spread throughout the area of [[Soleto]] in 1571.&lt;ref&gt;Manni, "La guglia, l'astrologo, la macàra" op.cit., p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work "Pronostico", dated 1571, we learn that Tafuri suggested to the Marquis [[Giovanni Del Tufo]] to stick on the shoulders of his sick child some pieces of paper with a [[psalm]] of death written on, in order to drive away bad luck and evil forces, a typically ecclesiastical remedy.&lt;ref&gt;Manni, "La guglia, l'astrologo, la macàra"op.cit., p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohand Tazerout''' (1893 in [[Aghribs]] &amp;ndash; 1973 in [[Tangier]]) was an Algerian philosopher, writer, translator and Algerian civilizationist. He translated several works of German philosophers including ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' by [[Oswald Spengler]] in 1931,&lt;ref name="Déjeux1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Déjeux|first=Jean|title=Dictionnaire des auteurs maghrébins de langue française|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIqosKCXtWIC&amp;pg=PA202|date=1 January 1984|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|language=French|isbn=978-2-86537-085-6|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpressiondz.com/culture/le_temps_de_lire/174044-un-brillant-penseur-algerien-injustement-ignore.html|title=MANIFESTE CONTRE LE RACISME DE MOHAND TAZEROUT (1893-1973) Un brillant penseur algérien injustement ignoré|publisher=Lexpressiondz.com|accessdate=9 May 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote many books, including several commentaries on Soviet communism (''La Métaphysique intellectuelle'' - 1955), and a political history of northern Africa (''Histoire politique de l'Afrique du Nord'' - 1961).

Born in the [[Kabylia]] region, he studied at [[Bouzaréa]] in [[Algiers]], and was appointed to a school in [[El-Had Thénia]]. In 1912, he rebelled against the director and left Algeria for Cairo, joining [[al-Azhar University]]. In 1913, he moved to Iran where he learned Persian. He subsequently moved to Russia and then China around 1914, picking up the local languages.&lt;ref name="GasimovDuque2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gasimov|first1=Zaur|last2=Duque|first2=Carl Antonius Lemke|title=Oswald Spengler als europäisches Phänomen: Der Transfer der Kultur- und Geschichtsmorphologie im Europa der Zwischenkriegszeit 1919-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oYX3AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142|date=14 August 2013|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|language=German|isbn=978-3-525-10126-1|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tazerout then visited Europe, and was recruited in Belgium for service in 1917 during [[World War I]]. He later studied at [[Poitiers]] and [[Strasbourg]]. He spent much of his last 20 years back in Algeria, before passing away in [[Tangier]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="Déjeux1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Déjeux|first=Jean|title=Dictionnaire des auteurs maghrébins de langue française|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIqosKCXtWIC&amp;pg=PA201|date=1 January 1984|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|language=French|isbn=978-2-86537-085-6|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
Leopold Weiss was born on 2 July 1900 to a Jewish family in Lemberg, [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (which is currently the city of [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]). Weiss was a descendant of a long line of Jewish [[rabbi]]s; however, his father, Akiva Weiss, broke from tradition and became a lawyer. Leopold received a religious education and was proficient in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] from an early age, as well as familiar with [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. He studied the Jewish Bible or [[Tanakh]], the text and commentaries of the [[Talmud]], the [[Mishna]] and [[Gemara]], also delving into the intricacies of Biblical [[exegesis]] and the [[Targum]].

At the age of fourteen he escaped school and joined the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austrian army]] under a false name. After a week or so, his father traced him with the help of the police, and he was escorted back to [[Vienna]].{{Sfn|Road|p=56}}

===Years in wilderness (1920–1922)===
After abandoning university in Vienna, Weiss drifted aimlessly around 1920s Germany, working briefly for the expressionist film director [[Fritz Lang]] ([[F. W. Murnau]], according to ''The Road to Mecca''). By his own account, after selling a jointly written film script, he splurged the windfall on a wild party at an expensive Berlin restaurant, in the spirit of the times. While working as a telephone operator for an American news agency in Berlin, Weiss obtained a coveted interview with Russian author [[Maxim Gorky]]'s wife, his first published piece of journalism, after simply ringing up her hotel room.&lt;ref name=islamicencyclopedia.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Muhammad Asad – Islamic Encyclopedia|url=http://islamicencyclopedia.org/islamic-pedia-topic.php?id=698}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Muhammad Asad in 1982.jpg|thumb|300px|right]] --&gt;

==Stay in Middle East (1922–1926)==


In 1922 Weiss moved to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], staying in [[Jerusalem]] at the house of his maternal uncle [[Dorian Feigenbaum]] at his invitation. Feigenbaum was a [[psychoanalyst]], a disciple of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], and later founded the ''[[Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]''.

===Foreign correspondent for ''Frankfurter Zeitung''===
He picked up work as a [[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for the German newspaper ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'', one of the most prestigious newspapers of Germany and Europe,{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} selling articles on a freelance basis. His pieces were noteworthy for their understanding of Arab fears and grievances against the Zionist project.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} He published a small book on the subject in 1924, and this so inspired the confidence of the ''Frankfurter Zeitung'' that it commissioned him to travel more widely still, to collect information for a full-scale book. Weiss made the trip, which lasted two years.

==Conversion to Islam (1926)==
To gain closer assignments in the Arabic world, Weiss developed an ever-deepening engagement with Islam.  This led to his religious conversion in 1926 in Berlin and adopting an Arabic name, Muhammad Asad.

Asad spoke of Islam:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Islam appears to me like a perfect work of architecture. All its parts are harmoniously conceived to complement and support each other; nothing is superfluous and nothing lacking; and the result is a structure of absolute balance and solid composure."&lt;ref name="islamicencyclopedia.org"/&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Magazine ''[[Saudi Aramco World]]'' in a 2002 essay described his journey to conversion in these words: "Two roads diverged in Berlin in the 1920s: a well-worn one to the West, the other, rarely traveled, to the East. Leopold Weiss, a gifted young writer, traveler and linguist with a thorough knowledge of the Bible and the [[Talmud]] and with deep roots in European culture, took the road eastward to [[Mecca|Makkah]]."&lt;ref name="islamicencyclopedia.org"/&gt;

==Years in Arabia (1927–1931)==
After his conversion to Islam, Asad moved to [[Saudi Arabia]] making a journey by camel across the [[Arabian Desert]], from [[Tayma]] to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name="Lure of Mecca"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lure of Mecca|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197406/the.lure.of.mecca.htm|access-date=22 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113084034/http://saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197406/the.lure.of.mecca.htm|archive-date=13 January 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed there for nearly six years during which he made five [[Hajj|pilgrimages]].&lt;ref name="Journey of lifetime"&gt;{{cite web|title=Journey of a lifetime|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199204/the.journey.of.a.lifetime.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside, he started writing essays for the [[Swiss]] newspaper ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'', and continued to do so till 1934.{{Sfn|Banda-e-Sehrai|p=265}}

===Ibn Saud's confidant and Bolshevik allegations===
After the sudden death of his wife Elsa, Asad stayed on in Mecca where, in a chance encounter in the [[Masjid al-Haram|Grand Mosque's]] library, he met [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Prince Faysal]]. On Faysal's invitation, Asad met [[Ibn Saud|King Abdulaziz]] (founder of modern [[Saudi Arabia]]); the meeting led to almost daily audiences with the King, who quickly came to appreciate Asad's knowledge, keen mind and spiritual depth.&lt;ref name="islamicencyclopedia.org"/&gt; Ibn Saud allowed Asad to visit the [[Najd]] region (in the King's company), which was forbidden to foreigners at that time.&lt;ref name=yourmiddleeast.com /&gt;

In late 1928, an [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] named Abdallah Damluji, who had been an adviser to Ibn Saud, submitted a report to the British on "[[Bolshevik]] and Soviet penetration" of the [[Hijaz]]. In this report, after highlighting Asad's activities in Arabia, Damluji alleged that Asad had connections with [[Bolshevik]]s: "What is the real mission which makes him endure the greatest discomforts and the worst conditions of life? On what basis rests the close intimacy between him and Shaykh Yusuf Yasin (secretary to the [[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] and editor of the official newspaper ''Umm al-Qura'')? Is there some connection between von Weiss and the Bolshevik consulate in [[Jeddah|Jidda]]?"&lt;ref name=martinkramer.org /&gt;

===Ikhwan Rebellion===
According to Asad, he did finally become a secret agent of sorts. [[Ibn Saud]] sent him on a secret mission to Kuwait in 1929, to trace the sources of financial and military assistance being provided to [[Faisal al-Duwaish|Faysal al-Dawish]] – an [[Ikhwan]] leader-turned-rebel against Ibn Saud's rule.&lt;ref name=martinkramer.org /&gt; Asad, after traveling day and night through the desert without lighting fire, reached [[Kuwait]] to collect first-hand evidence. He concluded that the British were providing arms and money to Ad-Dawish to weaken Ibn Saud for the purpose of securing a 'land route to India' – a railroad from [[Haifa]] to [[Basra]] ultimately connecting the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="Welcome-Back: Umar Mukhtar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Umar Mukhtar – The Lion of the Desert|url=http://www.welcome-back.org/profile/m_asad_11.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Sfn|Road|p=228}}

==Years in British India and Pakistan (1932–1952)==
[[File:ChNiazAliKhan2.jpg|thumb|right|Muhammad Asad (seated right) and his wife Pola Hamida Asad (seated left) at the residence of [[Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan]] in [[Jauharabad]], Pakistan.  Circa 1957]]

===Meeting Iqbal and visiting Kashmir===
Asad left Arabia and came to [[British India]] in 1932 where he met South Asia's premier Muslim poet, philosopher and thinker [[Muhammad Iqbal]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Iqbal had proposed the idea of an independent Muslim state in India, which later became [[Pakistan]]. Iqbal persuaded Asad to stay on in British India and help the Muslims of India establish their separate Muslim state. Iqbal introduced Asad to [[Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan]], a philanthropist and agriculturalist, who, on the advice of Muhammad Iqbal, established the Dar-ul-Islam Trust Institutes in [[Pathankot]], India and [[Jauharabad]], Pakistan. Asad stayed on in British India and worked with both Muhammad Iqbal and Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Azam, K.M., ''(A Righteous Life: Founder of Dar ul Islam Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan)'', Lahore: Nashriyat, 2010 (583 pp., Urdu) {{ISBN|978-969-8983-58-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Allama Iqbal encouraged Asad to translate Sahih Al-Bukhari in English for the first time in history. Asad responded positively and started making the arrangements for his translation. In order to find a place serene enough to stimulate his intellectual and spiritual cerebration, he arrived in Kashmir during the summer of 1934. There, he met Mirwaiz Mouli Yusuf who became his close friend. While working enthusiastically on his translation, he also set up his own printing press in Srinagar. The first two chapters of his translation were printed in Srinagar. Asad mentions in his book  ''Home-coming of the Heart'' that he had a special relationship with Kashmir and that he felt very sad when he left it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/opinion/story/185901.html|title=My Hero in my Homeland|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koshurladke.blogspot.com/2015/04/my-hero-in-my-homeland-in-his-homecoming.html|title=Koshur Ladke|author=Muneeb Majid|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tariqramadan.com/english/2015/06/09/my-hero-in-my-homeland-in-his-home-coming-by-muneeb-majid |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708185239/http://tariqramadan.com/english/2015/06/09/my-hero-in-my-homeland-in-his-home-coming-by-muneeb-majid |archive-date=8 July 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internment as enemy alien (1939–1945) ===

When the [[Second World War]] broke out in 1939, Asad's parents were arrested and, subsequently, murdered by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]]. Asad himself was arrested in [[Lahore]] in 1939, a day after the war broke out, by the British as an enemy alien. This was despite the fact that Asad had refused German nationality after the annexation of Austria in 1938 and had insisted on retaining his Austrian citizenship. Asad spent three years in prison, while his family consisting of his wife, Munira, and son, Talal, after being released from detention earlier, lived under the protection of Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan at the latter's vast {{convert|1000|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate in Jamalpur, 5&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Pathankot]]. Asad was finally released and reunited with his family in Jamalpur when the Second World War ended in 1945.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Role in Pakistan Movement===

Asad supported the idea of a separate Muslim state in India.  After the independence of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, in recognition for his support for Pakistan, Asad was conferred full citizenship by Pakistan and appointed the Director of the Department of Islamic Reconstruction by the Government of Pakistan,&lt;ref name=www.mischief-films.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Documentary: A Road To Mecca|url=http://www.mischief-films.com/medialibrary/film_road_to_mecca/A_Road_to_Mekka_Presskit_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he made recommendations on the drafting of Pakistan's first Constitution.&lt;ref name="islamicencyclopedia.org"/&gt; In 1949, Asad joined Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as head of the Middle East Division and made efforts to strengthen Pakistan's ties with the Muslim states of the Middle East. In 1952, Asad was appointed as Pakistan's Minister Plenipotentiary to the United Nations in New York – a position that he relinquished in 1952 to write his autobiography (up to the age of 32), ''The Road to Mecca''.&lt;ref name="islamicencyclopedia.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=www.thetruecall.com&gt;{{cite web|title=The True Call|url=http://www.thetruecall.com/home/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=194|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606053010/http://www.thetruecall.com/home/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=194|archivedate=6 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career as a diplomat===

Asad contributed much to Pakistan's early political and cultural life but was shunned from the corridors of power. He served this country as the head of the Directorate of Islamic Reconstruction, Joint Secretary of the Middle East Division in [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Foreign Office]], [[Minister Plenipotentiary]] to the United Nations and organizer of the International Islamic Colloquium. If one delves into the archival material of these government departments, the role played by Asad for his beloved [[Pakistan]] can be dealt with in detail.

===Marriage controversy and resignation===

By chance, at a reception Asad met Pola, an [[Polish American|American of Polish origin]] who was destined to become his third wife (d. 2007). She was a young, beautiful and intelligent woman. He fell in love with her and when he came to know that she had already embraced Islam he decided to marry her, despite the difference of age and temperament. But under the rules of the Foreign Office, he was bound to get prior permission to marry a non-[[Pakistani nationality law|Pakistani national]].&lt;ref name="islamicencyclopedia.org"/&gt; He applied through the proper channels but the [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] rejected his application. So, he submitted his resignation from the Foreign Service, divorced his Arabian wife (Munira, d. 1978) and in the inspiring company of his new wife, he sat down and wrote his extraordinary [[The Road to Mecca (book)|The Road to Mecca]].

During his stay in [[Switzerland]], Asad received a letter from the [[President of Pakistan]], [[Ayub Khan (field marshal)|General Ayub Khan]], who was a great admirer of his book named [[The Principles of State and Government in Islam]] (1961). In a subsequent exchange of letters, he proposed to Asad to come to Pakistan and have the membership of a seven-man group of Muslim scholars – who both supposedly knew the world and were experts on Islam – to advise him with regard to everyday matters as well as the drawing up of a new Islamic constitution for the country.&lt;ref name=allamaiqbal.com&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Citizen of Pakistan|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/publications/journals/review/aproct09/9.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At that time, Asad was immersed in his cherished work on the [[Quran|Qur'an]], and so he regretfully declined.

After many years, Asad was again invited by another President of Pakistan, [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|General Zia ul-Haq]], in 1983 and that was his last visit to this country. When he arrived at [[Islamabad]], which he had not yet seen, he was received at the plane with great honour and escorted to the [[Aiwan-e-Sadr|Presidency]]. During his sojourn in Islamabad, there was a series of meetings with members of the Ansari Commission in order to prepare a kind of programme for the President for the future. Asad agreed with some, and as usual disagreed with others, which he found retrograde.&lt;ref name="islamicencyclopedia.org"/&gt; On one point he was firm and insistent that Muslim women should have exactly the same rights in the political sphere as had men, to the extent of becoming Prime Minister. Asad also spared some time to meet with his surviving friends in [[Lahore]] and Islamabad and at the request of the President made several radio and television appearances, as always spontaneous. On his return, he was besieged by letters from literally hundreds of admirers in Pakistan, offering him land, a house, everything but he refused politely, as his concept of Pakistan was beyond all these worldly trivialities.

== Later years and death ==
Towards the end of his life, Asad moved to Spain and lived there with his third wife, Pola Hamida Asad, an American national of Polish Catholic descent who had also converted to Islam, until his death on 20 February 1992 at the age of 91. He was buried in the Muslim cemetery of [[Granada]] in the former [[Moorish]] province of [[Andalusia]], Spain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Family==

Asad had a son, [[Talal Asad]], from his second Saudi Arabian wife, Munira. Talal Asad is now an anthropologist specializing in [[religious studies]] and [[postcolonialism]]. Asad also had a step-son named Heinrich (converted name Ahmad) with his first wife Else (converted name Aziza).&lt;ref&gt;[http://muhammadasad.info/bintro.htm The Truth Society – Muhammed Asad]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and recognition==
[[File:Muhammad Asad Square in Vienna.jpg|thumb|200px |Muhammad Asad Square in [[Donaustadt]], Vienna]]

===Muhammad Asad Platz===
In April 2008, a space in front of the [[Vienna International Centre|UNO City]] in the 22nd [[Districts of Vienna|District of Vienna]] was named ''Muhammad-Asad-Platz'' in honor of Muhammad Asad.&lt;ref name="unis.unvienna.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Vienna.Org|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/en/pressrels/2008/unisvic161.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The step was taken as part of a two-day program on the [[European Year of Intercultural Dialogue]] focusing on Islam and its relationship with Europe.&lt;ref name="youngmuslimdigest.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Young Muslim digest on Vienna Square|url=http://www.youngmuslimdigest.com/report/05/2008/muhammad-asad-festival-in-vienna/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program commemorated the life and work of Asad, described as a great Austrian visionary, who earned international recognition by building bridges between religions.&lt;ref name="archives.dawn.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dawn Story on Muhammad Asad Platz|url=http://archives.dawn.com/2008/04/19/top14.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The honoree's son [[Talal Asad]], the President of the Islamic Community of Austria Anas Schakfeh and Vienna's cultural adviser Andreas Mailath-Pokorny were present at the unveiling of the square. Mailath-Pokorny, while talking to the media said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There is probably no more appropriate place to honor Muhammad Asad than that in front of the UN-City. Muhammad Asad was a citizen of the world, who was at home, and left his mark, everywhere in the world, especially in the [[Orient]]."&lt;ref name="austriantimes.at"&gt;{{cite web|title=Austrian Times|url=http://austriantimes.at/index.php?id=4951-newentry}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Honorary postage stamp===
On 23 March 2013, [[Pakistan Post]] issued a [[Postage stamp|stamp]] with denomination of [[Pakistani rupee|Rs]]. 15 under the "Men of Letters" Series in honor of [[Allamah]] Muhammad Asad.&lt;ref name="pakpost.gov.pk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan Post|url=http://www.pakpost.gov.pk/stamps1/AllamaMuhammadAsad.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first complete translation into English was published in 1799. The second, by John T. Goldthwait, was published in 1960 by the [[University of California Press]].

== Section One ==
''Of the Distinct Objects of the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime''

Kant states that feelings of enjoyment are subjective. In this book, he describes his observations. His interest is not in coarse, thoughtless feelings or in the other extreme, the finest feelings of intellectual discovery. Instead, he writes about the finer feelings, which are intermediate. These require some sensitivity, intellectual excellence, talent, or virtue.

There are two kinds of finer feeling: the feeling of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and the feeling of the beautiful. Kant gives examples of these pleasant feelings. Some of his examples of feelings of the beautiful are the sight of flower beds, grazing flocks, and daylight. Feelings of the sublime are the result of seeing mountain peaks, raging storms, and night.

In this section, Kant gives many particular examples of feelings of the beautiful and the sublime. Feelings of the beautiful "occasion a pleasant sensation but one that is joyous and smiling." On the other hand, feelings of the sublime "arouse enjoyment but with horror."

Kant subdivided the sublime into three kinds. The feeling of the terrifying sublime is sometimes accompanied with a certain dread or melancholy. The feeling of the noble sublime is quiet wonder. Feelings of the splendid sublime are pervaded with beauty.

== Section Two ==
''Of the Attributes of the Beautiful and Sublime in Man in General''

Kant described the relationship between these finer feelings and humanity. The feelings are not totally separate from each other. Beauty and the sublime can be joined or alternated. Kant claimed that tragedy, for the most part, stirs the feeling of the sublime. Comedy arouses feelings for beauty. The personal appearance of humans prompts these feelings in various cases. A person's social position also affects these feelings.

Human nature has many variations of the feelings of the beautiful and the sublime. Some variations of the terrifying sublime are the adventurous and grotesque. Visionaries and cranks are persons who have fantasies and whims. The beautiful, when it degenerates, produces triflers, fops, dandies, chatterers, silliness, bores, and fools.

Sympathy or compassion and also good-natured agreeableness are not true virtues, according to Kant. True virtue is the quality of raising the feeling of humanity's beauty and dignity to a principle. When a person acts in accordance with this principle, regardless of inclination, that person is truly and sublimely virtuous.

"A profound feeling for the beauty and dignity of human nature and a firmness and determination of the mind to refer all one's actions to this as to a universal ground is earnest, and does not at all join with a changeable gaiety nor with the inconstancy of a frivolous person." With this observation, Kant will attempt to fit the various feelings of the beautiful and sublime, and the resulting moral characters, into [[Galen]]'s rigid arrangement of [[the four humours]] or human [[temperament]]s: [[Melancholia|melancholic]], [[Four temperaments#Sanguine|sanguine]], [[choleric]], and [[phlegmatic]].

Kant asserted that the human temperaments or dispositions are  fixed and separate characters. An individual who has one frame of mind has no feeling or sense for the finer feelings that occur in a person of another temperament. 
*A person who has a constitution that is melancholic will have a predominating feeling for the sublime. That person may possess genuine virtue based on the principle that humanity has beauty and worth.
*One who has a sanguine nature will mostly have a feeling for the beautiful. This results in an "adoptive" virtue that rests on goodheartedness. This person's compassion and sympathy depend on the impression of the moment.
*A choleric human will have a feeling for the splendid or showy sublime. As a result, this person will possess an apparent virtue. Kant calls it "a gloss of virtue." This includes a sense of honor and concern for outward appearance.
*Phlegmatic people have apathy or lack of any finer feeling. They therefore may have an absence of virtue.
As a whole, human nature in general is a combination of these virtues. As such, it is a splendid expression of beauty and dignity.

== Section Three ==
''Of the Distinction of the Beautiful and Sublime in the Interrelations of the Two Sexes''

In Section Three, Kant asserts that women predominantly have feelings for all that is beautiful. Men, on the contrary, have mostly feelings for the sublime. Any other feelings that are only for the enhancement of the main feeling. Kant admits, though, that the distinction is not absolute. Since "we are dealing with human beings; we must also remember that they are not all alike."

Kant helps to root notions of inequality in the Western social structure.  For example, Kant argues that "a woman is little embarrassed that she does not possess high insights; she is beautiful and captivates, and that is enough ... Laborious learning or painful pondering, even if a woman should greatly succeed in it, destroys the merits that are proper to her sex."

Women's mental ability and understanding, then, refer to the beautiful. Men's deep, noble understanding is not suitable for women. Women have beautiful virtues such as kindness and benevolence. Men's virtue is noble and has to do with principles and duty. Because a woman is concerned with the beautiful, the worst that can be said against her is that she is disgusting. A man's greatest defect, however, would be that he is ridiculous, as this is the opposite of the sublime.

In sexual selection, a woman demands that the man have noble and sublime characteristics. A man wants a woman to possess beautiful qualities. In a marriage, the husband and wife unite their disparate attributes to form, as it were, a single moral person. The man's understanding combines with the wife's taste to constitute a union.

== Section Four ==
''Of National Characteristics, so far as They Depend upon the Distinct Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime''

Here Kant describes the different ways that various people have finer feelings. He qualifies his remarks by stating, "[W]hether these national differences are contingent and depend upon the times and the type of government, or are bound by a certain necessity to the climate, I do not here inquire."

The [[Italy|Italians]] have a strong feeling for the beautiful with some mixture of the thoughtful sublime. The French have mostly a feeling for the beautiful, but with the addition of the joyful sublime. The feeling of the Germans is an almost equal blend of both the beautiful and the splendid sublime in that they are much concerned with outward appearances. The feeling of the noble sublime predominates with the English, whose actions are guided by principles rather than impulses. With their cruel [[auto-da-fé|autos-da-fé]] and harsh conquests, the [[Spaniard]]s have feeling for the terrifying sublime. [[Dutch people|Dutch]] people in [[Holland]] have no finer taste and are concerned only with what is useful. [[Arab]]s are like the Spaniards. [[Persian people|Persian]]s resemble the French. The [[Japan]]ese are the Englishmen of the [[Orient]]. West India displays its love of the grotesque sublime, as also do the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]]. [[Africa]]n [[Negro]]es possess no finer feelings. [[North America]]n [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]], however, have a feeling for the sublime in that they are adventurous, honorable, truthful, proud, brave, and valorous.

In antiquity, the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had remarkable feelings for both the beautiful and the sublime. However, with the [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]], this decayed into a love of false glitter. The subsequent [[barbarian]] [[goths|Gothic]] civilization had an overpowering feeling for the grotesque. Kant claimed that his time witnessed "the sound taste of the beautiful and noble blossoming forth both in the arts and sciences and in respect to morals." He declared that it is necessary to educate the younger generation so that they will have noble simplicity, high morals, and finer feelings.

[[File:Stucchi della volta della basilica sotterranea di porta maggiore.jpg|thumb|vault of the Porta Maggiore Basilica]]

The '''Porta Maggiore Basilica''' is an underground [[basilica]] &lt;ref&gt;[Jérôme Carcopino. Etudes romaines. La basilique pythagoricienne de la Porte Majeure. Paris, l'Artisan du livre, 1927]&lt;/ref&gt; discovered in 1917 near [[Porta Maggiore]] in [[Rome]]. It is dated to the first century BC &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romeandart.eu/en/art-neo-pythagorean.html NEO-PYTHAGOREAN BASILICA OF PORTA MAGGIORE, Romeandart]&lt;/ref&gt;. It is believed to have been the meeting place of the  [[neo-Pythagorean]]s, and is the only historical site that has been associated with the [[neo-Pythagorean]] movement. This school of mystical Hellenistic philosophy preached asceticism and was based on the works of [[Pythagoras]] and [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt; Lisa Spencer, ''The Neo-Pythagoreans at the Porta Maggiore in Rome'', Rosicrucian digest,[https://www.rosicrucian.org/rosicrucian-digest-pythagoreans  vol. 87 / 1 (2009), p 36   ]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a precursor to the basilicas built during the Christian period, centuries later.  It was opened to small groups of visitors only in April 2015.

==Discovery==
It is {{convert|12|m|abbr=on|-1}} below the street level. The underground chamber was discovered accidentally in 1917 during the construction of a railway line from Rome to Cassino. An underground passage  caved in, revealing the hidden chamber.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/12005864/Secret-pagan-basilica-in-Rome-emerges-from-the-shadows-after-2000-years.html  Secret pagan basilica in Rome emerges from the shadows after 2,000 years,  Nick Squires, RThe Telegraph, 19 Nov 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The structure is thought to have been constructed by the [[Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus|Statilius]] family. The then head of the family, Titus Statilius Taurus, was accused by the Senate for what Tacitus in his Annals called “addiction to magical superstitions”. He protested his innocence but eventually committed suicide in CE53.

==Architecture==

The basilica has three naves lined by six rock pillars and an apse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/basilicae.html|title=Basilicae|author=Ball Platner, Samuel|publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2V_SllC9rwQC&amp;pg=PA377&amp;lpg=PA377&amp;dq=Neopythagorean+Basilica+di+Porta+Maggiore&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=59TBANBLhY&amp;sig=eN99B8pf9NS0AH5ITEk13ElL4Gk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOpJ--luLWAhUjw4MKHQVsBAsQ6AEIYzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=Neopythagorean%20Basilica%20di%20Porta%20Maggiore&amp;f=false Guida di Roma sotterranea - Guide to underground Rome: Dalla Cloaca Massima alla Domus Aurea i più affascinanti siti sotterranei della capitale, Carlo Pavia, Gangemi, 2000, p. 376]&lt;/ref&gt;They are decorated with stucco images of centaurs, griffins and satyrs.

Originally the basilica was entered through a long downhill entrance from the Prenestina Street, and through a vestibule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adnkronos.com/cultura/2015/04/24/basilica-sotterranea-porta-maggiore-svela-suoi-misteri_zDbkR7aq4UdDYREPgzNqxL.html?refresh_ce The Underground Basilica of Porta Maggiore unveils its mysteries, 24/04/2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening==
It has undergone a  restoration that has taken several years. In 1951 a concrete shell was constructed that enclosed the entire basilica. Air purifiers have been installed to combat radon gas.

The 40ft-long basilica is now opened to visitors. The visiting groups are kept small because of the fragility of the monument. The temperature and humidity must be kept within a narrow range. It is open during 2nd and 4th Sunday of every month, and the tour must be prearranged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coopculture.it/heritage.cfm?id=184 Underground Basilica of Porta Maggiore, società cooperativa culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pramada''' (negligence, carelessness) is the root cause of all pains and problems afflicting all human-beings. Adhyatma Upanishad. 14,&lt;ref&gt;प्रमादो ब्रह्मनिष्ठायां न कर्तव्यज् कदाचन |
प्रमादो मृत्युरित्याहुर्विद्यायां ब्रह्मवादिनः || Adhyatma Upanishad 14.http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_pdf/adhyatmaupan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
terms Pramada as death itself.

==Meaning==

'''Pramada''' in [[Sanskrit]] variously means - negligence, inertia, inadvertence, indolence, idleness, sluggishness, inattentiveness. Pramada produces forgetfulness. It is the root cause of all pains and problems afflicting human-beings.

==Implication==

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] XIV 13,17, lists Pramada (negligence) with Apravrtti (inactivity), Aprakasha (non-illumination) and Moha (delusion) as the products of Tamasi vivrddhe (preponderant state of dullness), which is opposite to knowledge produced by Sattva. The yogasutra ( chapter 1 verse 30 ) includes it in a list of nine causes of mental disturbances.

In [[Buddhism]], Aceshta (sloth), Apravrtti (inactivity) and Pramada (negligence) are collectively known as Thinamiddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Buddhism and Bhagavad Gita|author=Kashi Nath Upadhyaya|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBbznHuPrTYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=Pramada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K9oQUZO5Io3xrQeImoGIDA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Pramada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jainism]], the expression, Yoga, means activity of the mind, speech and body and Pramada-yoga means careless activity of mind, speech and body, and without caution; it is included in Himsa (injury to the vitalities of the mind, speech and body). Asatya (falsehood) and Chaurya (theft) i.e. statement uttered and things taken influenced by Pramada, are also Himsa. There are fifteen kinds of indolence or Pramada which can over-power the human-mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aspects of Jaina Religion|author=Vilas Adinath Sangave|publisher=Bhartiya Jnanpith|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UhvGRoyAqMC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=Pramada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K9oQUZO5Io3xrQeImoGIDA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Pramada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the list of five causes of bondage given at Umasvati’s Tattvartha Sutra 8:1, Kasaya (passion) and Pramada (negligence) are listed as independent causes of Bandhahetavah (bondage).

==Advaita view, in the light of Vivekachudamani==

[[Sanskrit prosody|Slokas]] 322 to 329 of [[Vivekachudamani]] of [[Adi Shankara|Sankaracharya]], explain the [[Advaita]] [[Vedanta]],s concept of the [[Sanskrit]] expression, Pramada.

[[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] begins with the instruction that those who are firmly established in [[Brahman]] should not be guilty of Pramada i.e. negligence or carelessness about which state [[Sanatkumara]] had told [[Dhritarashtra]], was death – pramadam vai mrtyumaham bravimi (I call negligence itself death.) Because fall by negligence is fall from one’s real nature, then forgetfulness arises, the ensues the sense of the “I” in the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|Anatman]] the cause of all miseries. Sankara adds that forgetfulness confounds even a learned man through defects of intellect for [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] covers a man who is out-ward-bent even if he has annulled the [[Panchakosha]]s. Furthermore, if the mind, outward bent, strays away even in the least from its ideal, it will fall continuously; the one who has fallen comes to ruin then there is no going up. For a man of discrimination and in deep concentration on Brahman, there is no other death than Pramada or inadvertence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekcudamani|author=Sri Candrasekhara Bharati of Srngeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|pages=320–324|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/vivekacudamani-of-sri-samkara-bhagvatpata-with-an-english-translation-of-the-commentary-in-samskrt-by-jagadguru-sri-candrasekhara-bharati-svaminah-sri-samkaracarya-of-sarada-pitha-srngeri/oclc/633667305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Religion and Nothingness''''' (''{{lang-ja|Shūkyō to wa Nanika}}''; the original title translates literally as "What is Religion?") is a 1961 book by the Japanese philosopher [[Keiji Nishitani]], in which the author discusses [[nihilism]].&lt;ref name="Habito"&gt;[[#Hab95|Habito 1995]]. p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in English translation in 1982, and received positive reviews, commending Nishitani for his understanding of both western and eastern philosophy. The appearance of the English translation increased interest in Nishitani's ideas among philosophers.

==Reception==
===Overview===
''Religion and Nothingness'' first appeared in English translation in 1982, generating increasing interest in Nishitani's ideas among philosophers, theologians, and religious scholars.&lt;ref name="Habito" /&gt;

===Mainstream media===
The book received positive reviews from Donald L. Smith in ''[[Library Journal]]'',&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;[[#Smi83|Smith 1983]]. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and J. N. Gray in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.&lt;ref name="Gray" /&gt; Smith wrote that Nishitani "presents a subtle philosophical analysis of reality and a lively argument for resolving problems of being in terms of certain metaphysical principles of Zen Buddhism." Smith called the book "profound yet clearly written", and credited Nishitani with "erudite wisdom and understanding of both Eastern and Western philosophical traditions."&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Gray wrote that Nishitani "achieves a remarkable cross-fertilization of the most profound and radical elements in Eastern and Western philosophy and spiritual experience", and that the book "will have the utmost value for all those who see in contemporary Western philosophy the unresolved issue of nihilism, and who are prepared to entertain the supposition that thought emerging from a tradition in which the experience of Nothingness was not threatening, and rather a benediction, may have something to teach us."&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;[[#Gra83|Gray 1983]]. p. 1023.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic journals===
The book was reviewed by Philip Blosser in ''[[Research in Phenomenology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blo84|Blosser 1984]]. pp. 281-288.&lt;/ref&gt; the theologian [[Thomas J. J. Altizer]] in ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Alt84|Altizer 1984]]. pp. 198-199.&lt;/ref&gt; the Buddhist studies scholar [[Bernard Faure]] in ''[[The Journal of Asian Studies]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fau85|Faure 1985]]. pp. 402-404.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas P. Kasulis in ''[[The Journal of Religion]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kas85|Kasulis 1985]]. pp. 436-438.&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard H. Drummond in ''Journal of Ecumenical Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dru85|Drummond 1985]]. pp. 131-135.&lt;/ref&gt; James L. Fredericks wrote in ''[[The Journal of Religion]]'' that ''Religion and Nothingness'' appeals to "a broad theologically or philosophically oriented readership."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fre93|Fredericks 1993]]. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluations in books===
Graham Parkes called ''Religion and Nothingness'' Nishitani's masterwork, writing that in it Nishitani achieved a philosophical synthesis that matches the achievements of the philosophers [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and [[Martin Heidegger]] in depth of insight.&lt;ref name="Parkes"&gt;[[#Par05|Parkes 2005]]. p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2928">[[File:Abbaye Saint-Victor de Paris en 1655.png|thumb|Abbey of St. Victor, 1655]]
The '''school of St Victor''' was the medieval [[monastic school]] at the [[Augustinian]] [[St. Victor's Abbey, Paris|abbey of St Victor]]. The name also refers to the '''Victorines''', the group of philosophers and mystics based at this school as part of the University of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Haren, ''Medieval Thought'' (1985), pp. 111-114&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in the twelfth century by [[Peter Abelard]]'s tutor and subsequent opponent, the realist school master [[William of Champeaux]], and a prominent early member of their community was [[Hugh of St Victor]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferruolo, The Origins of the University, Stanford University Press 1985, {{ISBN|0-8047-1266-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent members were [[Achard of St. Victor]], [[Andrew of St Victor]], [[Richard of St Victor]], [[Walter of St Victor]] and [[Godfrey of St Victor]], as well as [[Thomas Gallus]].

Under the rigorous supervision of Hugh, St Victor offered a coherent and structured approach to learning through the cultivation of personal virtue rather than the requisition of knowledge for its own sake. This is exemplified in the schema for the [[liberal arts]] laid out in Hugh's ''Didascalicon'', in which he exhorts the reader to ''Omnia Disce'', or to know all. By 1160, the abbey had become a place of retreat from the schools, echoing the original act of weary retirement enacted by William of Champeaux at its founding. By the time of Godfrey, St Victor was primarily concerned with the instruction of its own canons, rather than the emphasis on the extern school operated earlier in the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Swanson, ''The Twelfth Century Renaissance'' (1999), pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The end of the Victorines as a unique force came by 1173, when the reactionary Walter was appointed as prior. Walter launched a furious attack upon the intellectual culture of the school and its members with his ''Contra quatuor labyrinthos Francae'' (Against the Four Labyrinths of France), a denunciation of secular theological teaching. After this violent repudiation of Victorine pedagogical tradition the abbey was, in effect, a self-contained Augustinian priory like any other.&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Swanson, ''The Twelfth Century Renaissance'' (1999), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jan van Ruusbroec]] submitted his [[Groenendael Priory]] to their Rule in 1335, from which stemmed the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] and [[Thomas à Kempis]]' [[Devotio Moderna]]. A major theme of their studies was the anagogical relationship between the Divine and the Mundane, adopted by Pope Eugene IV in his 5.1.1435 bull&lt;ref&gt;Belgian National Archives, Anderlecht, Fonds Ecclesiastique&lt;/ref&gt; declaring Roman supremacy.

Born in [[Wey (state)|Wey]], [[Zhou Kingdom]],&lt;ref name=Cua/&gt; he was a statesman and reformer of the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] during the [[Warring States period]] of ancient China. His policies laid the administrative and political foundations that would enable Qin to conquer all of China, uniting the country for the first time and ushering in the [[Qin dynasty]]. He and his followers contributed to the [[Book of Lord Shang]], a foundational work of  what has modernly been termed [[Chinese Legalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), 1.1 Major Legalist Texts, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/chinese-legalism/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
With the support of [[Duke Xiao of Qin]], Gongsun left his lowly position in Wei (to whose ruling family he had been born, but had yet to obtain a high position in)&lt;ref&gt;pg 79 of ''Classical China''&lt;/ref&gt; to become the chief adviser in Qin, where he received the title of Shang (after his fief). His numerous reforms transformed the peripheral Qin state into a militarily powerful and strongly centralized kingdom. Changes to the state's legal system (which were said to have been built upon [[Li Kui (legalist)|Li Kui]]'s ''[[Canon of Laws]]'') propelled the Qin to prosperity. Enhancing the administration through an emphasis on [[meritocracy]], his policies weakened the power of the feudal lords.

[[Mark Edward Lewis]] once identified his reorganization of the military as responsible for the orderly plan of roads and fields throughout north China. This might be far fetched, but Gongsun was as much a military reformer as a legal one.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Goldin, ''Persistent Misconceptions about Chinese Legalism''. p. 18 [https://www.academia.edu/24999390/Persistent_Misconceptions_about_Chinese_Legalism_]&lt;/ref&gt; Gongsun oversaw the construction of [[Xiangyang]].&lt;ref&gt;John Man 2008. p. 51. ''Terra Cotta Army''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Shang Yang school of thought was favoured by [[Emperor Wu of Han]],&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 115&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Keay]] mentions that Tang figure [[Du You]] was drawn to Shang Yang.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur F. Wright 1960. p. 99. ''The Confucian Persuasion''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7lBWH2rxRFsC&amp;pg=PA99]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms==
He is credited by [[Han Fei]] with the creation of two theories;
#"fixing the standards" ({{zh|c=定法}})
#"treating the people as one" ({{zh|c=一民}})

Believing in the rule of law and considering loyalty to the state above that of the family, Gongsun introduced two sets of changes to the State of Qin. The first, in 356 BCE, were:
#[[Li Kui (legalist)|Li Kui]]'s ''[[Book of Law]]'' was implemented, with the important addition of a rule providing punishment equal to that of the perpetrator for those aware of a crime but failing to inform the government.  He codified reforms into enforceable laws.
#Assigning land to soldiers based upon their military successes and stripping nobility unwilling to fight of their land rights. The army was separated into twenty [[military rank]]s, based upon battlefield achievements.
#As manpower was short in Qin, Gongsun encouraged the cultivation of unsettled lands and wastelands and immigration, favouring [[agriculture]] over luxury [[commerce]] (though also paying more recognition to especially successful merchants).

Gongsun introduced his second set of changes in 350 BCE, which included a new standardized system of land allocation and reforms to [[taxation]].

The vast majority of Gongsun's reforms were taken from policies instituted elsewhere, such as from [[Wu Qi]] of the [[Chu (state)|State of Chu]]; however, Gongsuns's reforms were more thorough and extreme than those of other states, and monopolized policy in the hands of the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Creel, What Is Taoism? 107 https://books.google.com/books?id=5p6EBnx4_W0C&amp;pg=PA107&lt;/ref&gt; Under his tenure, Qin quickly caught up with and surpassed the reforms of other states.

==Domestic policies==

Gongsun introduced [[land reform]]s, privatized land, rewarded farmers who exceeded harvest quotas, enslaved farmers who failed to meet quotas, and used enslaved subjects as (state-owned) rewards for those who met government policies.

As [[human resources|manpower]] was short in Qin relative to the other states at the time, Gongsun enacted policies to increase its manpower. As Qin peasants were recruited into the military, he encouraged active migration of peasants from other states into Qin as a replacement workforce; this policy simultaneously increased the manpower of Qin and weakened the manpower of Qin's rivals. Gongsun made laws forcing citizens to marry at a young age and passed tax laws to encourage raising multiple children. He also enacted policies to free [[convict]]s who worked in opening wastelands for agriculture. &lt;!-- The EB says "He is also said to have forced all persons into “productive occupations,” such as farming or soldiering (but not commerce)..." --&gt;

Gongsun partly abolished [[primogeniture]] (depending on the performance of the son) and created a double tax on households that had more than one son living in the household, to break up large clans into nuclear families.

Gongsun moved the capital to reduce the influence of nobles on the administration.

==Gongsun's death==
Deeply despised by the Qin nobility,&lt;ref name="rgh" /&gt; Gongsun could not survive [[Duke Xiao of Qin|Duke Xiao of Qin's]] death. The next ruler, [[King Huiwen of Qin|King Huiwen]], ordered the [[nine familial exterminations]] against Gongsun and his family, on the  grounds of fomenting rebellion. Yang had previously humiliated the new duke "by causing him to be punished for an offense as though he were an ordinary citizen."&lt;ref&gt;pg 80 of ''Classical China'', ed. William H. McNeill and Jean W. Sedlar, [[Oxford University Press]], 1970. LCCN: 68-8409&lt;/ref&gt; Yang went into hiding and tried to stay at an inn. The innkeeper refused because it was against Yang's laws to admit a guest without proper identification, a law Yang himself had implemented.

Yang was executed by jūliè ({{linktext|車裂}}, [[dismemberment]] by being fastened to five [[chariot]]s, [[cattle]] or horses and being torn to pieces);&lt;ref&gt;''[[wikisource:zh:韓非子/和氏|和氏]], [[Han Feizi (book)|Han Feizi]]'', [[Han Fei]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[:zh:东周列国志|东周列国志]]'', [[:zh:蔡元放|蔡元放]]&lt;/ref&gt; his whole family was also executed.&lt;ref name="rgh"&gt;[[:wikisource:zh:史記/卷068|商君列传 (vol. 68)]], ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', [[Sima Qian]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his death, King Huiwen kept the reforms enacted by Gongsun. A number of alternate versions of Gongsun's death have survived. According to [[Sima Qian]] in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', Gongsun fled to his fiefdom, where he raised a rebel army but was killed in battle. After the battle, King Hui of Qin had Yang's corpse torn apart by chariots as a warning to others.

Following the execution of Gongsun, King Huiwen turned away from the central valley south to conquer [[Sichuan]] ([[Shu (state)|Shu]] and [[Ba (state)|Ba]]) in what [[Steven Sage]] calls a "visionary reorientation of thinking" toward material interests in Qin's bid for universal rule.&lt;ref&gt;Steven F. Sage 1992. p.116. Ancient Sichuan and the Unification of China. https://books.google.com/books?id=VDIrG7h_VuQC&amp;pg=PA116&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9179">'''Shem-Tov ben Joseph ibn Falaquera''', also spelled '''Palquera''' (1225 &amp;ndash; c. 1290) ([[Hebrew]]: '''שם טוב בן יוסף אבן פלקירה''') was a [[Spanish Jews|Spanish Jewish]] philosopher and poet and commentator. A vast body of work is attributed to Falaquera, including encyclopedias of [[Islamic philosophy|Arabic]] and [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] philosophies, [[maqama]]s, some 20,000 poetic verses, and commentaries on [[Maimonides]]’ ''[[Guide to the Perplexed]]''.&lt;ref name="Macmillan Reference"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jospe|first=Raphael|title=Falaquera, Shem Tov ben Joseph ibn|journal=Encyclopaedia Judaica|year=2007|volume=6|pages=679–683|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?action=interpret&amp;id=GALE{{!}}CX2587506249&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=umd_um&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1|accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The common theme in Falaquera’s writing was to encourage observant Jews to study philosophy and to appreciate the harmony that existed between Torah and rational truth learned in philosophy.&lt;ref name="Macmillan Reference"/&gt; While Falaquera did not advocate teaching the secrets of science and divine sciences to every man,&lt;ref name="Harvey 1987 105"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Steven|title=Falaquera's Epistle of the Debate: An Introduction to Jewish Philosophy|year=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-29173-5|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; he did advocate the teaching of these truths to a broader range of educated Jewish males than previous proponents of rationalist thinking.

==Biography==
Although not much is known about his personal life, it is believed that Falaquera’s ''Sefer ha-Mevakkesh'', The Book of the Seeker, was a semi-autobiographical work representing a time in Falaquera’s life when he underwent a mid-life crisis and moved away from his youthful poetry towards more intellectual works. From this book and other writings it is assumed that Falaquera was never married due to the views on women he expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=Steve|title=Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2009|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/falaquera/|accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is no information regarding how he supported himself, although references to poverty in the ''Sefer ha-Mevakkesh'' and other writings may signify his own personal destitution.&lt;ref name="Harvey 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=Steven|title=Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2007|date=July 2009|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/falaquera/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another note regarding the tensions that existed between the Jews and non-Jewish nations during Falaquera’s time is seen in the ''Megillat ha-Zikkaron'' and a comment in the ''Sefer ha-Mevakkesh'' about the “difficult times under the powerful hand of the non-Jewish nations who prevailed over us.&lt;ref name="Harvey 2007"/&gt;”

One of the biggest criticisms by historians concerning Falaquera is that he was not original. Falaquera would not have taken issue with these complaints since he saw his purpose as clarifying, interpreting, and teaching older established philosophical systems to a broader audience of educated Jews.&lt;ref name="Harvey 1987 105"/&gt; In order to accomplish this task, Falaquera produced many translations and compilations of Greek and Arabic philosophical texts into Hebrew. However, Falaquera did not merely transcribe other texts. He would paraphrase, edit, and weave in commentaries from other authors in order to make the texts more comprehensible and more palatable to an observant educated Jewish audience. In addition, inspired by the debate between David Kimhi, a Maimonidean, and Judah Alfakhar, an anti-Maimonidean, Falaquera wrote the ''Iggeret ha-Vikku’ah'', The Epistle of the Debate, in order to counter the objections of anti-rationalist thinkers and to persuade them of the value of studying philosophy and science.&lt;ref name="Harvey 2007"/&gt; However, this goal was ultimately not successful as evidenced by continued further controversies surrounding Maimonides and rationalist studies. In the ''Iggeret ha-Vikku’ah'', a debate between a traditionally observant Jew, the pietist, and a Jew educated in philosophy, the scholar, is described. Over the course of the dialogue, the scholar showed the pietist that many elements of philosophy do not conflict with the Torah and in fact provide a better understanding of it. Furthermore, the scholar shows the pietist that philosophy should be studied by those educated Jews who will know what teachings of philosophy to disregard and what teachings to incorporate into their understanding.

Falaquera also wrote one of the first commentaries on Maimonides’ ''Guide to the Perplexed'' in order to clarify sections that he felt people were misreading or misinterpreting, despite Maimonides urgings in the Guide that readers not comment or expound upon his work.&lt;ref name="Harvey 2007"/&gt; Falaquera used his robust knowledge of sources to both strengthen and part from Maimonides’ teachings according to his own beliefs. Indeed, Falaquera’s commentary contains some viewpoints in his own name which is rarely seen in Falaquera’s other works.&lt;ref name="Harvey 2007"/&gt;

{{Zen Buddhism}}
{{nihongo|'''''Shikantaza'''''|只管打坐}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] translation of a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term for [[zazen]] introduced by [[Rujing]], a monk of the [[Caodong]] school of [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]], to refer to a practice called "Silent Illumination", or "Serene Reflection", by previous Caodong masters.&lt;ref&gt;Taigen Dan Leighton. Cultivating the Empty Field: The Silent Illumination of Zen Master Hongzhi, Tuttle, 2000, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, it is associated with the [[Soto school]].

==Etymology==
The term ''shikantaza'' is attributed to [[Dōgen]]'s teacher [[Tiantong Rujing]] (1162-1228), and it literally means, "nothing but (''[[:wikt:只|shi]][[:wikt:管|kan]]'') precisely (''[[:wikt:打|da]]'') sitting (''[[:wikt:坐|za]]'')."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer-Schreiber, 321&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Dōgen means, "doing only zazen whole-heartedly" or "single-minded sitting."&lt;ref&gt;Akishige, 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaner, 158&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shikantaza'' is the [[Kanji#On'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading)|Sino-Japanese reading]] of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] words ''zhǐguǎn'' 只管 "by all means; merely, simply; only concerned with" and ''dǎzuò'' 打坐 "[Buddhism/Daoism] sit in meditation".&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis, John, ed. (2003), ''ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary'', University of Hawaii Press, p. 1267, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]'' translates ''shikan'' or ''zhǐguǎn'' 只管 as "to focus exclusively on", ''taza'' or ''dǎzuò'' 打坐 as "to [[Squatting position|squat]], sit down cross-legged", which corresponds with [[Sanskrit]] ''utkuṭuka-stha'', and translates ''shikan taza'' from ''zhǐguǎn dǎzuò'' 只管打坐 (or ''qíguǎn dǎzuò'' 祇管打坐 with qí "earth god; local god") as "meditation of just sitting", explained as the "Zen form of meditation chiefly associated with the Sōtō school, which places emphasis on emptying the mind, in contrast to the kōan method".&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Muller]], [http://www.buddhism-dict.net Dictionary of Buddhism], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Ishmael Ford]] says some authors hypothetically trace the root of ''shikantaza'' "just sitting" to [[vipassana]] meditation, but "this is far from certain."&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese has many [[homophones]] pronounced ''shikan'', and this etymological mix-up about ''shikan'' 只管 "only; just" stems from a more commonly used word that translates the Sanskrit "''[[śamatha]]'' and ''[[vipaśyanā]]''," names for the two basic forms of [[Buddhist meditation]]: Japanese ''shikan'' 止観 "concentration and observation"&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe Toshirō (渡邊敏郎), Edmund R. Skrzypczak, and Paul Snowden, eds. (2003), ''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'' (新和英大辞典), 5th edition, Kenkyusha, 1125. This bilingual dictionary lists 止観 and 21 other words pronounced ''shikan'' (e.g., 仕官 "government service" and 弛緩 "relaxation") but not ''shikan'' 只管.&lt;/ref&gt; (as practiced by the Tendai sect), from Chinese ''zhǐguān'' 止觀 "[Buddhism] keep mental calm while observing the universe" (cf. the ''[[Mohe Zhiguan]]''),&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis (2003), 1267.&lt;/ref&gt; which [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] ''shi'' or ''zhǐ'' 止 "stop; stabilize; ''śamatha''" and ''kan'' or ''guān'' 觀 "observe; contemplate; ''vipaśyanā''". An instance of the  confusion of 止観 for 只管 is [[Steve Hagen]]'s claim that "''shi'' [Hagen is referring to Dōgen's '只'] means tranquility [= '止'], ''kan'' [Hagen is referring to Dōgen's '管'] means awareness [= '観'], ''ta'' means hitting exactly the right spot (not one atom off), and ''za'' means to sit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = HarperOne| isbn = 0-06-114329-4| last = Hagen| first = Steve| title = Meditation Now Or Never| year = 2007| page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==
===Silent illumination===
"Just sitting" is the term that [[Rujing]] used for "silent illumination" or "silent reflection"{{refn|group=note|As a mirror, or still water, that reflects the moon.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Koten Benson [https://obcon.org/dharma/essays-on-practice/serene-reflection/ ''Serene Reflection''], Order of Buddhist Contemplatives, The Journal of the Order of Buddhist Comtemplatives”, vol. 4, no. 1: 33–35. (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;}} (Chinese ''mòzhào'' 默照; Japanese ''mokushō'') which may be understood as the integrated practice of [[shamatha]] (calming the mind) and [[vipassana|vipashyana]] (insightful contemplation), and was the hallmark of the [[China|Chinese]] [[Caodong]] school of [[Chinese Chán|Chan]].&lt;ref&gt;Taigen Dan Leighton. Cultivating the Empty Field: The Silent Illumination of Zen Master Hongzhi, Tuttle, 2000, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is not merely just the union of calming and insight, which had already been developed within the Tiantai Buddhist tradition in medieval China. Rather, it is a description of the natural essence and function of the mind. In this sense, it can be traced back to the earliest Chan teachings of [[Bodhidharma]].&lt;ref name="kraft"&gt;Kraft, 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Chan teacher to articulate silent illumination was the Caodong master [[Hongzhi Zhengjue]] (1091—1157), who  wrote an inscription entitled "silent illumination meditation" (''Mokushō zen'' 默照禅 or ''Mòzhào chán'' 默照禪).&lt;ref&gt;Taigen Dan Leighton. Cultivating the Empty Field: The Silent Illumination of Zen Master Hongzhi, Tuttle, 2000, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; According to Taigen Dan Leighton, this practice is a "nondual objectless meditation" which:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...involves withdrawal from exclusive focus on a particular sensory or mental object to allow intent apprehension of all phenomena as a unified totality. This objectless meditation aims at a radical, refined nondualism that does not grasp at any of the highly subtle distinctions to which our familiar mental workings are prone and which estranges us from our experience. Such subject-object dichotomization is understood as artificial, a fabrication. 

Silent illumination is also objectless in the sense of not seeking after specific limited goals. The ultimate purpose of spiritual practice, universally awakened heart/mind, cannot be set apart from our own inherent being and our immediate, moment-to-moment awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Taigen Dan Leighton. Cultivating the Empty Field: The Silent Illumination of Zen Master Hongzhi, Tuttle, 2000, pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[A. Charles Muller]] explains that this method, which involved seeking enlightened wisdom through complete stillness of the mind, became "the main practice of the Sōtō Zen school, where Dōgen characterized it by such terms of as 'just sitting' 只管打坐.".&lt;ref&gt;Muller, A. Charles, ed.: The [[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]], ed. of 04/03/2008, Chinese Readings Index (Pinyin System) [http://buddhism-dict.net/ddb/indexes/read-zh-py.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shikantaza's origins can also be traced back to silent illumination. However, some teachers see it as different from the teachings of [[Hongzhi Zhengjue]] in terms of practice and theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/web-archive/2012/11/8/you-are-already-enlightened.html Guo Gu, You are Already Enlightened. Buddhadharma, winter 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dogen===
In the thirteenth century, [[Dōgen|Dōgen Zenji]] who introduced the Soto School in Japan, used much of Hongzhi's writings on silent illumination to help shed light on what he termed "shikantaza". From then on the practice of shikantaza has been primarily associated with the Soto school. While silent illumination is in theory a "methodless method", it is important to realize that, the Dogen practice of shikantaza "took a somewhat different approach."&lt;ref&gt;Hoofprint of the Ox, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese Chán]] Master [[Shengyen]] has stated, that shikantaza is similar to silent illumination.&lt;ref name="kraft"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Song of Mind, 150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern interpretations===
Master Shengyen explains the meaning of the term in this way:
{{quote|This “just sitting” in Chinese is ''zhiguan dazuo''. Literally, this means “just mind sitting.” Some of you are familiar with the Japanese transliteration, ''shikantaza''. It has the flavor of “Just mind your own business.” What business? The business of minding yourself just sitting. At least, you should be clear that you're sitting. “Mind yourself just sitting” entails knowing that your body is sitting there. This does not mean minding a particular part of your body or getting involved in a particular sensation. Instead, your whole body, your whole being is sitting there.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Shengyen (2008). The Method of No-Method, &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94}}}}

According to Merv Fowler, shikantaza is described best as, 
{{quote|quiet sitting in open awareness, reflecting directly the reality of life.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, 96&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shikantaza is often termed a goalless meditation in quiet awareness, 
{{quote|not working on any koan, or counting the breath. It is an alert condition, performed erect, with no trace of sluggishness or drowsiness.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, 76&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Practice==

===Soto===
In his work ''Fukanzazenji'', Dogen writes of, 
{{quote|Finding a clean, dry place, if possible cool in summer and warm in winter. He goes on to describe the use of a ''[[zafu]]'', or small round pillow one sits upon, and the ''[[zabuton]]'', or larger square, flat cushion under the zafu, which supports the ankles and knees. He then describes the basic posture—sitting erect, with hands in the lap, eyes cast downward—as 'the method used by all Buddha ancestors of Zen.'"&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 32&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fred Reinhard Dallmayr writes, 
{{quote|Regarding practice, Dogen counseled a distinctly nonattached or nonclinging kind of action, that is, an activity completely unconcerned with benefits or the accomplishment of ulterior goals: the activity of 'just sitting' or 'nothing-but-sitting' (''shikantaza'') whereby self-seeking is set aside in a manner resembling a resolute 'dropping off of body and mind.'&lt;ref&gt;Dallmayr, 178-179&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Master [[Shengyen]], 
{{quote|While you are practicing just sitting, be clear about everything going on in your mind. Whatever you feel, be aware of it, but never abandon the awareness of your whole body sitting there. ''Shikantaza'' is not sitting with nothing to do; it is a very demanding practice, requiring diligence as well as alertness. If your practice goes well, you will experience the 'dropping off' of sensations and thoughts. You need to stay with it and begin to take the whole environment as your body. Whatever enters the door of your senses becomes one totality, extending from your body to the whole environment. This is silent illumination."&lt;ref&gt;Attaining the Way, 163&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sanbo Kyodan===
The modern Japanese Zen master, Haku'un Ryōko Yasutani says: 
{{quote|Shikantaza is the mind of someone facing death. Let us imagine that you are engaged in a duel of swordsmanship of the kind that used to take place in ancient Japan. As you face your opponent you are unceasingly watchful, set, ready. Were you to relax your vigilance even momentarily, you would be cut down instantly. A crowd gathers to see the fight. Since you are not blind you see them from the corner of your eye, and since you are not deaf you hear them. But not for an instant is your mind captured by these impressions.&lt;ref&gt;Hakuun Ryōko Yasutani, in ''Introductory Lectures on Zen Training'', by Kapleau&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast to this opinion, some of the Zen masters in Loori's book ''The Art of Just Sitting'' deride Yasutani's description, giving their own version as the right or correct way to do shikantaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Loori| first =John Daido| authorlink =John Daido Loori| title =The Art of Just Sitting: Essential Writings on the Zen Practice of Shikantaza| publisher =Wisdom Publications| year =2000| location =| pages =| url =http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49773732&amp;referer=one_hit| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-86171-327-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rinzai===
Concerning the [[Rinzai school]], [[John Daido Loori]] writes, 
{{quote|..[A]fter students finish [[koan]] study, they then take up the practice of shikantaza.&lt;ref&gt;Loori, 137&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Haku'un Yasutani]] agrees, stating, 
{{quote|The Rinzai and [[Obaku school|Obaku School]]s emphasize [[koan]] study; the Soto school emphasizes shikantaza. But even when koan study is stressed, shikantaza is not abandoned. All of the great masters of these three schools emphasize the importance of shikantaza."&lt;ref&gt;Maezumi, 97&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Complementary practices===
In Japan, [[vipassana]] and [[shamatha]] are sometimes used in addition to shikantaza as complementary practices.&lt;ref&gt;Illuminating Silence, 103&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been called the pupil, daughter or wife of [[Pythagoras]], although others made her the wife of [[Brontinus]]. Her place of birth and the identity of her father are just as uncertain, leading some authors to suggest that there was more than one person whose details have become merged (these are sometimes referred to as Theano I and Theano II).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plant|first=Ian Michael|title=Women writers of ancient Greece and Rome: an anthology|year=2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3621-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYGay_yqBLUC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=theano+school#v=onepage&amp;q=theano%20school&amp;f=false|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few fragments and letters ascribed to her have survived which are of uncertain authorship.

==Life==
Little is known about the life of Theano, and the ancient sources are confused. According to one tradition, she came from [[Crete]] and was the daughter of [[Pythonax]],&lt;ref name="porphyry4"&gt;Porphyry, ''Life of Pythagoras'', 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sudat84"&gt;Suda, ''Theano'' θ84&lt;/ref&gt; but others said she came from [[Crotone]] and was the daughter of [[Brontinus]].&lt;ref name="sudat84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laertius"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 42-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sudap3120"&gt;Suda, ''Pythagoras'' π3120&lt;/ref&gt; She was said by many to have been the wife of [[Pythagoras]],&lt;ref name="porphyry4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sudat84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laertius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sudap3120"/&gt; although another tradition made her the wife of Brontinus.&lt;ref name="sudat84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laertius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sudat83"&gt;Suda, ''Theano'' θ83&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iamblichus]], in an attempt to resolve the confusion, refers to ''Deino'' as the wife of Brontinus.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''On the Pythagorean Life'', 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The children variously ascribed to Pythagoras and Theano included three daughters, [[Damo (philosopher)|Damo]], [[Myia]], and [[Arignote]], and a son, [[Telauges]].&lt;ref name="porphyry4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sudat84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laertius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sudap3120"/&gt;

==Writings==
The writings attributed to Theano were: ''Pythagorean Apophthegms'', ''Female Advice'', ''On Virtue'', ''On Piety'', ''On Pythagoras'', ''Philosophical Commentaries'', and ''Letters.''&lt;ref name="plant69"&gt;Ian Michael Plant, (2004), ''Women writers of ancient Greece and Rome: an anthology'', page 69. University of Oklahoma Press&lt;/ref&gt; None of these writings have survived except a few fragments and letters of uncertain authorship. Attempts have been made to assign some of these fragments and letters to the original Theano ('''Theano I''') and some to a later Theano ('''Theano II'''),&lt;ref name="waithe"&gt;Mary Ellen Waithe, ''A History of Women Philosophers. Volume 1, 600 BC-500 AD''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt; but it is likely that they are all [[pseudonym]]ous fictions of later writers,&lt;ref name="plant69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lambropoulou133"&gt;Voula Lambropoulou, ''Some Pythagorean female virtues'', in Richard Hawley, Barbara Levick, (1995), ''Women in antiquity: new assessments'', page 133. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; which attempt to apply Pythagorean philosophy to a woman's life.&lt;ref name="plant69"/&gt; The surviving fragment of ''On Piety'' concerns a Pythagorean analogy between numbers and objects; the various surviving letters deal with domestic concerns: how a woman should bring up [[child]]ren, how she should treat [[servant]]s, and how she should behave virtuously towards her [[husband]].&lt;ref name="plant69"/&gt;

Theano told [[Hippodamus of Thurium]] (may be [[Hippodamus of Miletus]], who according to Aristotle planned the city of [[Thurii|Thurium]] in 440 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=386|title=Sturgis' Illustrated Dictionary of Architecture and Building: An Unabridged Reprint of the 1901-2 Edition|year=2013|authors=Russell Sturgis, Francis A.

See also: Mary Ritter Beard, (1946), ''Woman as force in history: a study in traditions and realities'', p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thesleff, Stobaeus, and Heeren, Theano wrote in ''On Piety''&lt;ref name=Waithe /&gt;
:''I have learned that many of the Greeks believe Pythagoras said all things are generated from number. The very assertion poses a difficulty: How can things which do not exist even be conceived to generate? But he did not say that all things come to be from number; rather, in accordance with number - on the grounds that order in the primary sense is in number and it is by participation in order that a first and a second and the rest sequentially are assigned to things which are counted.''

In [[law]] and [[ethics]], '''universal law''' or '''universal principle''' refers as concepts of legal [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] actions, whereby those [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] and rules for governing human beings' conduct which are most universal in their acceptability, their applicability, translation, and [[philosophical]] basis, are therefore considered to be most legitimate.  One type of Universal Law is the Law of Logic which prohibits logical contradictions known as sophistry.  The Law of Logic is based upon the universal idea that logic is defined as that which is not illogical and that which is illogical is that which involves a logical contradiction, such as attempting to assert that an apple and no apple can exist at and in the same time and in the same place, and attempting to assert that A and not A can exist at and in the same time and in the same place. What goes around , comes around.

'''Ursula Martius Franklin''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|OOnt|FRSC}} (16 September 1921 – 22 July 2016), was a German-Canadian [[metallurgy|metallurgist]], research [[physics|physicist]], author, and educator who taught at the [[University of Toronto]] for more than 40 years.&lt;ref name="Lumley"&gt;Lumley, Elizabeth (editor) (2008), ''Canadian Who's Who 2008''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the author of ''The Real World of Technology'', which is based on her 1989 [[Massey Lectures]]; ''The Ursula Franklin Reader: Pacifism as a Map'', a collection of her papers, interviews, and talks; and ''Ursula Franklin Speaks: Thoughts and Afterthoughts'', containing 22 of her speeches and five interviews between 1986 and 2012. Franklin was a practising [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] and actively worked on behalf of pacifist and feminist causes. She wrote and spoke extensively about the futility of war and the connection between peace and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), pp. 2–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin received numerous honours and awards, including the [[Governor General's Awards in Commemoration of the Persons Case|Governor General's Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case]] for promoting the equality of girls and women in Canada and the [[Pearson Medal of Peace]] for her work in advancing human rights. In 2012, she was inducted into the [[Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering.utoronto.ca/About/Engineering_in_the_News/U_of_T_Engineers_Inducted_into_Canadian_Science_and_Engineering_Hall_of_Fame.htm?Fame|title=U of T Engineers Inducted into Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame|publisher=Faculty of Applied Science &amp; Engineering, University of Toronto|accessdate=2012-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927220945/http://www.engineering.utoronto.ca/About/Engineering_in_the_News/U_of_T_Engineers_Inducted_into_Canadian_Science_and_Engineering_Hall_of_Fame.htm?Fame|archivedate=2013-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Toronto high school, [[Ursula Franklin Academy]], has been named in her honour.&lt;ref name="Lumley, p.439"&gt;Lumley, p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin is best known for her writings on the political and social effects of technology. For her, technology was much more than machines, gadgets or electronic transmitters. It was a comprehensive ''system'' that includes methods, procedures, organization, "and most of all, a mindset".&lt;ref name="Franklin Real World, p.12"&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; She distinguished between ''holistic'' technologies used by craft workers or artisans and ''prescriptive'' ones associated with a division of labour in large-scale production. Holistic technologies allow artisans to control their own work from start to finish. Prescriptive technologies organize work as a sequence of steps requiring supervision by bosses or managers.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin argued that the dominance of prescriptive technologies in modern society discourages critical thinking and promotes "a culture of compliance".&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

For some, Franklin belongs in the intellectual tradition of [[Harold Innis]] and [[Jacques Ellul]] who warn about technology's tendency to suppress freedom and endanger civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Ellen. "An Interview with Heather Menzies (2003)." ''Antigonish Review''. January 1, 2004, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin herself acknowledged her debt to Ellul as well as to several other thinkers including [[Lewis Mumford]], [[C. B. Macpherson]], [[E. F. Schumacher]], and [[Vandana Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;see Franklin (Reader) p. 210, for example, as well as the more comprehensive list on pp. 367–368.&lt;/ref&gt; This debt was not without recognizing that this list was largely absent of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16180074|title=Will women change technology or will technology change women?|first=Ursula M.|last=Franklin|publisher=Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women / Institut canadien de recherches sur les femmes|others=|year=1985|isbn=9780919653092|location=Ottawa|pages=3|oclc=16180074}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the [[Philosophy of technology]], she believed that science was "severely impoverished because women are discouraged from taking part in the exploration of knowledge".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Early life ==

Ursula Maria Martius&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite web |url=https://utarms.library.utoronto.ca/ursula-martius-franklin-fonds |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829044656/https://utarms.library.utoronto.ca/ursula-martius-franklin-fonds |archivedate=2016-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] on September 16, 1921.&lt;ref name="Lumley" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/ursula-franklin/|title=Ursula Franklin|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Order" /&gt; Her mother was Jewish and an [[art history|art historian]]&lt;ref name=starobit/&gt; and her father, an [[ethnography|ethnographer]],&lt;ref name=starobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=pioneer&gt;Spurr, Ben.

(2014) ''Ursula Franklin Speaks: Thoughts and Afterthoughts''. Montreal &amp; Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Franklin decided to study science because she went to school during a time when the teaching of history was censored. "I remember a real subversive pleasure," she told an interviewer many years later, "that there was no word of authority that could change either the laws of [[physics]] or the conduct of [[mathematics]]."&lt;ref name="Speaks" /&gt; In 1948, Franklin received her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in experimental physics at the [[Technical University of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bulletin.uwaterloo.ca/2005/mar/02we.html|title=Hagey Lecturer addresses technology|publisher=[[University of Waterloo]], ''Daily Bulletin''|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began to look for opportunities to leave Germany after realizing there was no place there for someone fundamentally opposed to [[militarism]] and oppression. Franklin moved to Canada after being offered the Lady Davis postdoctoral fellowship at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=cbcobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=starobit/&gt; She then worked for 15 years (from 1952 to 1967) as first a research fellow and then as a senior research scientist at the [[Provincial Research Organization|Ontario Research Foundation]].&lt;ref name=starobit/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speaks" /&gt;&lt;ref name=a/&gt; In 1967, Franklin became a researcher and associate professor at the Department of Metallurgy and Materials Science University of Toronto's Faculty of Engineering where she was an expert in [[metallurgy]] and [[Materials science and engineering|materials science]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt; She was promoted to full professor in 1973 and was given the designation of University Professor in 1984, becoming the first female professor to receive the university's highest honour.&lt;ref name=cbcobit/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speaks" /&gt;&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.provost.utoronto.ca/awards/uprofessors/complete.htm |title=Complete List of University Professors |last=Toronto |first=University of |website=www.provost.utoronto.ca |language=en |access-date=2017-03-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170329125938/http://www.provost.utoronto.ca/awards/uprofessors/complete.htm |archivedate=2017-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed [[professor emeritus|professor emerita]] in 1987,&lt;ref name=a/&gt; a title she retained until her death.&lt;ref name=starobit&gt;Doherty, Brennan.

''Toronto Star'', July 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She served as director of the university’s Museum Studies Program from 1987 to 1989, was named a Fellow of the [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] in 1988, and a Senior Fellow of [[Massey College]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

[[Image:Operation Upshot-Knothole - Badger 001.jpg|thumb|A U.S. nuclear weapons test in 1953. Franklin helped end such above-ground testing.]]

===Scientific research===
Franklin was a pioneer in the field of [[Archaeological science|archaeometry]], which applies modern materials analysis to [[archaeology]]. She worked for example, on the dating of prehistoric bronze, copper and ceramic artifacts.&lt;ref name="Sheinin, p.839"&gt;Sheinin, p. 839.&lt;/ref&gt; One small example of her work in this field regards what was a standing question on the nature of shiny black Chinese mirrors found in high quantities in ancient tombs. Franklin's use of microscopic, etching, electron microprobe and x-ray fluorescence analyses produced evidence that what was thought by some to be a corrosive effect was in fact present in these ancient mirrors (and weapons) at their inception, in dark iron oxides intentionally added near the objects' surfaces. Franklin additionally pulled from historic and literary accounts of black mirrors in Chinese literature to support these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chase|first=W. T.|last2=Franklin|first2=Ursula Martius|date=1979|title=Early Chinese Black Mirrors and Pattern-Etched Weapons|jstor=4629305|journal=Ars Orientalis|volume=11|pages=215–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's expertise was also instrumental to dating glass; she guided a study on the remains of blue [[Trade beads|glass beads in North America]] remaining from early trade relationships between American Indian tribes and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ronald_Hancock/publication/282323826_A_note_on_the_neutron_activation_analysis_of_16th_-_and_17th_-century_blue_glass_trade_beads_from_the_easter_Great_lakes/links/560bc52208ae7fa7b8870012/A-note-on-the-neutron-activation-analysis-of-16th-and-17th-century-blue-glass-trade-beads-from-the-easter-Great-lakes.pdf?origin=publication_list|title=A Note on the Neutron Activation Analysis of 16th and 17th Century Blue Glass Trade Beads From the Eastern Great Lakes|last=Chafe|first=Ann|last2=Hancock|first2=Ron|last3=Kenyon|first3=Ian|publisher=Unknown literature review|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=18–20}} Original source: The Bead Forum, Issue 9, October 1986, pages 13-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s Franklin was one of a number of scientists who participated in the [[Baby Tooth Survey]], a project founded by Eric and [[Louise Reiss]] along with other scientists such as [[Barry Commoner]], which investigated levels of [[strontium-90]]—a [[Radioactivity|radioactive]] [[isotope]] in [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] from [[Nuclear testing|nuclear weapons testing]]—in children's teeth.&lt;ref name="Sheinin, p.839" /&gt; This research contributed to the cessation of [[Nuclear testing#Types of nuclear weapons tests|atmospheric weapons testing]].&lt;ref name="Speaks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="starobit" /&gt; Franklin published more than a hundred scientific papers and contributions to books on the structure and properties of metals and alloys as well as on the history and social effects of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the [[Science Council of Canada]] during the 1970s, Franklin chaired an influential study on conserving resources and protecting nature. The study's 1977 report, ''Canada as a Conserver Society'', recommended a wide range of steps aimed at reducing wasteful consumption and the environmental degradation that goes with it.&lt;ref&gt;Science Council of Canada. (1977) ''Canada as a Conserver Society: Resource Uncertainties and the Need for New Technologies''. Ottawa: Supply and Services Canada, pp. 71–88.&lt;/ref&gt; The work on that study helped shape Franklin's ideas about the complexities of modern technological society.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Franklin was also active in the Voice of Women (VOW), now the [[Canadian Voice of Women for Peace]], one of Canada's leading social advocacy organizations.  In 1968, she and VOW national president [[Muriel Duckworth]] presented a brief to a [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] committee asserting that Canada and the United States had entered into [[Defence Production Sharing Agreement|military trade agreements]] without adequate public debate. They argued that these commercial arrangements made it difficult for Canada to adopt independent foreign policy positions such as calling for an immediate U.S. military withdrawal from [[South Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerans, Marion Douglas. (1996) ''Muriel Duckworth: A Very Active Pacifist''. Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Franklin and Duckworth called on a committee of the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] to recommend that Canada discontinue its [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[Biological warfare|biological]] weapons research and spend money instead on environmental research and [[preventive medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerans, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was also part of a 1969 VOW delegation that urged the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] to withdraw from the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and establish a special agency to oversee Canadian [[disarmament]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerans, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Franklin participated in an organized campaign to win the right for [[conscientious objector]]s to redirect part of their income taxes from military uses to peaceful purposes. Her 1987 paper, written to support the campaign, argued that the well-recognized right to refuse military service on grounds of conscience should be extended to include the right to refuse to pay taxes for war preparations.&lt;ref&gt;The paper appears in ''The Ursula Franklin Reader'', as "The Nature of Conscience and the Nature of War," pp. 46–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin asserted that the [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|freedom of conscience provision]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] guaranteed this form of conscientious objection.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2 of the Charter states that everyone has certain fundamental freedoms including (a) freedom of conscience and religion.&lt;/ref&gt; Her paper was to be part of an appeal to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The lower courts had convicted those withholding part of their taxes of violating [[Income taxes in Canada|the Income Tax Act]]. In 1990 however, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativeservice.ca/uncertainty/community/COhistory.htm|title=A Brief History of Conscientious Objection in Canada|publisher=Alternative Service|accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mennonitechurch.ca/programs/peace/peacetax/|title=Conscientious Objection to Military Taxes|publisher=Mennonite Church|accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Franklin's retirement, she and several other retired female faculty members filed a class action lawsuit against the University of Toronto claiming it had been [[unjust enrichment|unjustly enriched]] by paying women faculty less than comparably qualified men. In 2002, the lawsuit was settled when the university acknowledged that many of its female professors had suffered from gender barriers and pay discrimination during their careers. As a result, about 60 retired women faculty received a [[pay equity]] settlement intended to compensate them for the lower salaries and pensions they had received.&lt;ref&gt;Valpy, Michael. "U of T recognizes female academics faced barriers." ''Globe and Mail'', April 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin continued to have a strong association with the University of Toronto's [[Massey College]] as a continuing senior fellow and senior resident.&lt;ref name="Lumley, p.439"/&gt; Her many activities include encouraging young women to pursue careers in science, promoting peace and social justice, and speaking and writing about the social effects of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Swenarchuk, pp. 5, 6, 9, 12, 16, 29, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of her articles and speeches on pacifism, feminism, technology and teaching are collected in ''The Ursula Franklin Reader'' published in 2006. Franklin is also the author of ''The Real World of Technology'' which is based on her 1989 [[Massey Lectures]] broadcast on [[CBC Radio]].

In a piece of writing entitled "Letter to a Graduate Student," Franklin encouraged the physics career of a student "Marcia," who is devoted to feminism yet interested in physics and unsure of how to integrate the two. In the letter Franklin extolls the merits of colleague [[Margaret Benston|Maggie Benston]], whose contributions to feminist thought and pedagogy, Franklin stated, issued from her integrated way of being and philosophical foundation in science. She cites as an example Benston's point that the negative side affects of contraceptive pills are considered tolerable according to present medical practices that are permeated by the patriarchal bias of reductionism. New methodologies are radically needed, she stressed, in concord with Benston's writings. Franklin's trust in relying on scientific principles to navigate even daily struggles such as an environment "surrounded by jerks" characterizes the letter's cheerful closing, in which she recommends "taking field notes" and imagining oneself as an "explorer come upon a strange tribe." In the letter Franklin mentions as an interested aside the extremely early state of research in solid organic matter, compared to the very well studied condition of solid state physics. She speculates that the neglect of this research area could have a political component, given its benefits to humans rather than to the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oYuMAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;ots=BR_hs2ZvTg&amp;dq=%22u.%20franklin%22%20crystallography&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Wild Science: Reading Feminism, Medicine and the Media|last=Marchessault|first=Janine|last2=Sawchuk|first2=Kim|date=2013-10-18|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136294501|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pacifism, feminism and war==
[[Image:Ursula Franklin book cover.jpg|thumb|The cover of Franklin's 2006 book on pacifism, feminism, technology, teaching and learning]]
Ursula Franklin explains in a prelude to her 2006 collection of papers, interviews and talks that her lifelong interest in structures, in what she terms "the arrangement and interplay of the parts within a whole," has been at the root of most of her activities.&lt;ref name="Franklin Reader, p.39"&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, "I can see how I have tried to wrestle with just one fundamental question: 'How can one live and work as a pacifist in the here and now and help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise?'"&lt;ref name="Franklin Reader, p.39"/&gt; As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. "Increasingly I found the maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels," she writes. "I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of 'them' and 'us,' of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement."&lt;ref name="Franklin41"&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls "the real world" by "the maps of pacifism and feminism".&lt;ref name="Franklin41"/&gt;

For her, feminism meant a completely new point of view: "Feminism isn't an employment agency for women; it's an alternative way of ordering the social space, in which women are the prototype rather than men. It is based on collaboration rather than competition. As a youngster, I still remember my feeling of joy that one could look at the earth differently. That's feminism; everything is differently oriented. Seeing the same world with different eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/judes/2016/07/ursula-franklin-pioneer-feminist-pacifist-scientist-and-social-justice-|title=Ursula Franklin a pioneer feminist, pacifist, scientist and social justice fighter

===Pacifism and conscience===

Central to Franklin's pacifism and her view of life is what she calls "the Quaker vision of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual conscience is at the heart of that vision. So too, is the need to discern appropriate ways of working for peace in each time and place "rather than relying on a dogma of unvarying rules of conduct".&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that for more than 300 years, Quakers have opposed war and violence and have objected to military service and conscription. They have worked on reconciliation, peace research and disarmament and in many countries have won the right for conscientious objectors to perform alternative service instead of taking part in war.&lt;ref name="Franklin Reader, p.53"&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin remarks that Quaker principles have not changed, but technology ''has'' changed the nature of war. In a modern technological society she argues, there is no longer a clear boundary between war and peace.&lt;ref name="Franklin Reader, p.53"/&gt; War planning is constant during peacetime and when wars are fought, women and children become targets.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Nations no longer depend primarily on conscripting military recruits, but rely on advanced weapons systems that are costly to build or acquire.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; She writes that the arms race is driven by a "technological imperative" which requires the creation of an enemy as a permanent social institution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern weapons technologies, including the required research and development, are particularly capital-intensive and costly. The time between initial research and the deployment of weapon systems can be as long as a decade, during which the government must provide financial security and political justification for the project. In other words, the state not only provides the funding but also identifies a credible external enemy who warrants such expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin points out that the technological nature of war requires states to conscript the resources needed to pay for hi-tech devices designed for destruction. Thus, people opposed to war are forced—through taxation—to pay for war preparations even if it violates their individual conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace and social justice===

In her 1987 paper, ''Reflections on Theology and Peace'', Ursula Franklin contends that "peace is not the absence of war—peace is the absence of fear."&lt;ref name="Franklin Reader, p. 76"&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; She asserts however, that fear of war and violence is not the only kind of fear that destroys peace. She includes fears arising for example, from economic insecurity, unemployment and the lack of adequate shelter. Franklin points to what she calls "the threat system" which manages people by instilling fear and uncertainty at all levels of society.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
For her, social justice is the essential element needed to banish fear and bring peace. Justice means freedom from oppression, but it also implies equality for all. "In God's eyes," she writes, "all creatures have value and are subjects of equal care and love; similarly, in a society of justice and peace, all people matter equally."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin suggests that in consumer-oriented societies, war and violence are the inevitable result of an acquisitive lifestyle that rejects caring and social justice. She quotes historian [[Lewis Mumford]]'s observation that during the rise of capitalism, the sins of greed, gluttony, avarice, envy and luxury became cardinal virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Mumford goes on to argue that the "moral change that took place under capitalism can be summed up in the fact that human purposes, human needs, and human limits no longer exercised a directing and restraining influence upon industry: people worked, not to maintain life, but to increase money and power and to minister to the ego that found satisfaction in vast accumulations of money and power."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis. (1973) ''The Condition of Man''. New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, Inc., p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin extends Mumford's argument by pointing to new global realities such as [[militarism|militarized economies]] dependent on weapons production and national borders increasingly closed to refugees. "Any modern theology of peace," she writes, "must, I think, take into account the worldwide drift towards 'techno-fascism,' the anti-people, anti-justice form of global management and power sharing that is developing around the world."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), pp. 71–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization as warfare===

Franklin argues that the end of the [[Cold War]] brought two main changes. First, the threat of war between the United States and Soviet Union was replaced by regional wars among smaller states. Second, war was transposed to what Franklin calls "another key"—the struggle for global commercial and economic dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; She asserts that this new form of war is now called [[globalization]] and its battlefields are global stock and currency markets.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; This economic warfare defines the enemy as all those who care about the values of community. "Whatever cannot be merely bought and sold," Franklin writes, "whatever cannot be expressed in terms of money and gain-loss transactions stands in the way of the 'market' as enemy territory to be occupied, transformed and conquered."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; A main strategy in this kind of warfare is the [[privatization]] of formerly public domains such as culture, health care, prisons and education to generate private profit. Franklin contends that the new economic warlords or "marketeers" aim, for example, to transform "the ill health or misery of our neighbours into investment opportunities for the next round of capitalism."&lt;ref name="Franklin Reader, p.124"&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that marketeers have become occupying forces served by "puppet governments who run the country for the benefit of the occupiers."&lt;ref name="Franklin Reader, p.124"/&gt; Franklin has also noted that in democratic politics, the economy is all that seems to matter. "Canada has almost no foreign policy," she says, "but rather is part of an elaborate network of trade agreements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larche.ca/en/inspirations/a_human_future_contributors/ursula_franklin|title=Democratic Essentials at Risk: An Interview with Ursula Franklin|last=Porter|first=Beth|publisher=L'Arche Canada|accessdate=2013-07-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130705184541/http://larche.ca/en/inspirations/a_human_future_contributors/ursula_franklin|archivedate=2013-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin recommends that resistance take the form of refusing to speak the language of the occupiers. This language includes such terms as ''stakeholders'', ''users'', ''health-care providers'' and ''consumers of education'' to refer to teachers and students, doctors, nurses, patients and communities.&lt;ref name="Franklin Reader, p.125"&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin also calls for resistance through court challenges and "the creative use of electronic media to bypass the occupation forces' control of information."&lt;ref name="Franklin Reader, p.125"/&gt; Finally, Franklin is a strong supporter of ''citizen politics'', a civic movement which focuses on practical solutions to common problems—everything from the absence of peace to homelessness and local traffic congestion.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Borrowing a Quaker term, Franklin calls on citizens to engage in ''scrupling'', the process of sitting down together to discuss and clarify common moral and political concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/2010/05/may-06-2010.html|title=An interview with Ursula Franklin|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], |accessdate=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; She writes that citizen politics does not seek to overthrow existing governments but to improve them "whether those in power like it or not."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also tries to defend communities against those intent, in Franklin's words, on "turning the globe into one giant commercial resource base, while denying a decent and appropriate habitat to many of the world's citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War, failure and 9/11===

Again and again in her writings, speeches and interviews, Ursula Franklin insists that war and its violence are not only morally wrong, but also ineffective, impractical, and costly. During a radio interview broadcast two days after the [[September 11 attacks]] in the U.S., Franklin argued that violence nowadays is always unsuccessful even for the powerful who try to use it. "Nothing has been resolved by violence over the past fifty years," Franklin said. "The rational thinking that force does not work, even for the enforcer, is staring us in the face."&lt;ref&gt;''How the World Has Changed'', an interview broadcast on ''Ideas'', CBC Radio, September 13, 2001. Quoted in Franklin (Reader), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In a newspaper article published just before the first anniversary of 9/11, Franklin wrote, "It is crucial to recognize that war and war measures are fundamentally dysfunctional instruments of problem-solving. Violence begets more violence, war begets further wars, more enemies and more suffering."&lt;ref&gt;''On the First Anniversary of September 11'', ''Toronto Star'', August 30, 2002. Quoted in Franklin (Reader), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Franklin suggested that it would have been more effective if, instead of launching a [[War on Terrorism]], the U.S. had interpreted the attacks as a political earthquake instead of an act of war. She argued that social and political structures are as inherently unstable as geological ones. "Geological fissures and human terrorists are created in a context of forces that can be understood and—at times—mitigated. Neither can be eliminated by bombing."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin asserts that militarism is the ultimate development of hierarchical social structures and threat-based systems. "They all work under the implicit assumption that some people matter much less than others, and that all people are of interest only as long as they are needed to support the system or to justify it."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that many prominent advocates for women's rights such as [[Jane Addams]] and [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] were pacifists. "To me, the struggle for women's rights and the opposition to militarism in all its forms are two sides of the same coin."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a CBC Radio interviewer suggested to Franklin that her ideas about peace and justice were not connected with what was actually happening in the aftermath of 9/11, she  readily agreed. "Yes, you are quite right. They are totally unconnected. I have spent the best part of my life trying to put these thoughts into the stream that makes decisions, and I've been spectacularly unsuccessful. That, I think, is a reflection on my ability in the climate of the time, not on the value of the thoughts."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological society==

For Ursula Franklin, technology is a set of practices in the "here and now" rather than an array of machines or gadgets.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), pp. 16, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a comprehensive ''system.'' "Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset."&lt;ref name="Franklin Real World, p.12"/&gt; Her definition is similar to the French thinker [[Jacques Ellul]]'s concept of ''technique''. Like Ellul, Franklin asserts that technological methods dominate the modern world. "Technology has built the house in which we all live," she writes, "today there is hardly any human activity that does not occur within this house."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, technology is a central element of the here and now. "In the broadest sense of the term, the here and now is our environment, that is, all that is around us—the ever-changing overlay of nature, the built environment, the institutional and social structures within which human activities take place, as well as the activities themselves—'the way things are done around here.'"&lt;ref name="Franklin Reader, p.137"&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin sees her studies of technology as an attempt to understand how technological practices affect the advancement of justice and peace.&lt;ref name="Franklin Reader, p.137"/&gt;

===Holistic and prescriptive technologies===

According to Ursula Franklin, technology is not a set of neutral tools, methods or practices. She asserts that various categories of technology have markedly different social and political effects. She distinguishes for example, between work-related and control-related technologies. Work-related technologies, such as electric typewriters, are designed to make tasks easier. Computerized word processing makes typing easier still. But when computers are linked into work stations—part of a system—word processing becomes a control-related technology. "Now workers can be timed," Franklin writes, "assignments can be broken up, and the interaction between the operators can be monitored."&lt;ref name="Franklin Real World, p.18"&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Liu Ding.jpg|thumb|An ancient Chinese bronze [[ding (vessel)|ding]]. Franklin describes the prescriptive methods used in producing such ritual vessels.]]

Franklin extends the distinction between work and control-related technologies to the larger concept of ''holistic'' and ''prescriptive'' ones. This enables her to consider the social implications of ''how'' work is performed. She writes that holistic technologies are usually associated with craft work. "Artisans, be they potters, weavers, metal-smiths, or cooks, control the process of their own work from beginning to finish."&lt;ref name="Franklin Real World, p.18"/&gt; Artisans may specialize in a particular kind of product, but they are always in total control of the process of production and each thing they make or create is unique.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Prescriptive technologies, on the other hand, break work down into a series of discrete, standardized steps. "Each step is carried out by a separate worker, or group of workers, who need to be familiar only with the skills of performing that one step."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[division of labour]] inherent in prescriptive technologies is usually associated with the [[industrial revolution]], Franklin points out that such production methods have been used since ancient times. Chinese bronze casting before 1200 BC for example, required a tightly controlled and closely supervised production process as well as a strict division of labour.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin describes Chinese bronze casting in some detail in ''Real World'', pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin writes that when she studied Chinese bronze casting as a metallurgist, "the extraordinary social meaning of prescriptive technologies dawned on me. I began to understand what they meant, not just in terms of casting bronze but in terms of discipline and planning, of organization and command."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology's culture of compliance===

Franklin argues that in modern society, control-related and prescriptive technologies are dominant. "When work is organized as a sequence of separately executable steps, the control over the work moves to the organizer, the boss or manager," she writes. "In political terms, prescriptive technologies are ''designs for compliance''."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 23. Emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt; For Franklin, workers accustomed to following prescriptive rules become used to seeing external control and internal compliance as normal and necessary. They also come to believe that there is only one prescribed way of performing a wide variety of tasks. "While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that we live in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept that there is only one way of doing 'it'."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin points out that prescriptive technologies have moved beyond materials production to the realms of administration, government and social services. She argues that tasks which require nurturing or caring for people, in health and education for example, are best done holistically. Yet such tasks are increasingly coming under the sway of prescriptive technologies based on what Franklin calls a production model. Professor Heather Menzies, an admirer of Franklin, describes for example, how nursing tasks are performed in keeping with preset, computerized check lists which leave little discretionary time for dealing with the unexpected or talking with patients who are lonely or distressed.&lt;ref&gt;Menzies, Heather. (2005) ''No Time: Stress and the Crisis of Modern Life''. Vancouver: Douglas &amp; McIntyre Ltd., pp. 126–130.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin herself notes that schools and universities test and promote students based on strict production schedules yet "if there ever was a holistic process, a process that cannot be divided into rigid predetermined steps, it is education."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology and power===

[[Image:Singer sewing machine detail1.jpg|thumb|Franklin writes that household sewing on machines such as this gave way to the industrial production of cheap clothing in sweatshops that exploited female labour.]]

Ursula Franklin rejects the idea that powerful technologies automatically determine the ways in which people live and work. She maintains that the uses of technology are not preordained, but are the result of conscious choices.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant prescriptive technologies establish structures of power and control that follow what Franklin sees as male patterns of hierarchy, authoritarianism, competition and exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Female workers are often victims of these patterns. Mechanical sewing machines were introduced in 1851 with the promise that they would liberate women from household drudgery. But when the machines ended up in factory sweatshops to produce cheap clothing, the new technology was used to exploit female workers.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; "A strictly prescriptive technology with the classic division of labour arose from the introduction of new, supposedly liberating 'domestic' machines," Franklin notes. "In the subsequent evolution of the garment industry, much of the designing, cutting, and assembling began to be automated, often to the complete exclusion of workers."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; She points to similar examples in other industries. Female operators helped introduce the telephone only to be replaced by automated switchboards after the technology had been successfully established while secretaries struggled to make the early mechanical typewriters function properly, but ended up performing fragmented and increasingly meaningless tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), pp. 106–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Many technological systems, when examined for context and overall design, are basically anti-people," Franklin writes. "People are seen as sources of problems while technology is seen as a source of solutions."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, people live and work under conditions structured for the well-being of technology even though manufacturers and promoters always present new technologies as liberating.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; "The dreams of flight, of fast private transportation, of instant communication across continents, and of helpful machines, all stress liberation from hard physical labour at work or drudgery at home."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; But once technologies are accepted and standardized, they often enslave or displace their users. Franklin argues that work could be made less prescriptive in workplaces that are less rigidly hierarchical if we adopted more holistic practices based on the way women traditionally work in running households for example, or in caring for children.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications technologies===

Franklin asserts that powerful communications technologies have reshaped political and social realities distancing people from each other and their immediate environments. Radio and television for example, transmit messages instantaneously from afar—messages that are separated from people's experiences in the vicinities where they live and work. Franklin calls such messages ''pseudorealities''. She writes they are based on images that are constructed, staged and selected to create emotional effects and the illusion of "being there" as a participant, not just as an observer.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; She asserts however, that one-way communications technologies reduce or eliminate ''reciprocity'', the normal give and take of face-to-face communication.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), pp. 48–49. In fact, Franklin writes that she would like to call these "non-communications" technologies because of their lack of reciprocity.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Franklin, the selective fragments or pseudorealities that become news stories are produced to attract and hold people's attention by focusing on the unusual over the usual. She acknowledges that no one is forced to watch television or listen to radio; people can explore other channels of communication. But the pseudorealities created by the media are still there "and the world is structured to believe in them."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that images from afar have taken over much of our everyday reality like an immensely powerful occupation force. "And somewhere, someone will have to ask, 'How come the right to change our mental environment—to change the constructs of our minds and the sounds around us—seems to have been given away without anybody's consent?'"&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Real World), p. 44. Franklin's question is somewhat similar to [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s warning about the effects of commercial media: "Once we have surrendered our senses and nervous systems to the private manipulation of those who would try to benefit from taking a lease on our eyes and ears and nerves, we don't really have any rights left. Leasing our eyes and ears and nerves to commercial interests is like handing over the common speech to a private corporation, or like giving the earth's atmosphere to a company as a monopoly." See, McLuhan, Marshall. (2003) ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man''. Critical edition, edited by W. Terrence Gordon. Corte Madera, CA: Gingko Press Inc. pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silence and the commons===

"Silence," Franklin writes, "possesses striking similarities [to] aspects of life and community, such as unpolluted water, air, or soil, that were once taken as normal and given, but have become special and precious in technologically mediated environments."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that the technological ability to separate recorded sound from its source makes the sound as permanent as the [[elevator music|Muzak]] that plays endlessly in public places without anyone's consent.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), pp. 158, 161.&lt;/ref&gt; For Franklin, such canned music is a manipulative technology programmed to generate predictable emotional responses and to increase private profit. She compares this destruction of silence to the [[British enclosure laws]] which fenced off the [[common land|commons]] for private farming.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin maintains that the core of the strength of silence is its openness to unplanned events. Quakers, she writes, worship God in collective silence. "I think that if any one of you attended a Quaker meeting, particularly on a regular basis," she told a 1993 conference on [[acoustic ecology]], "you would find that suddenly, out of the silence, someone will speak about something that had just entered ''your'' mind. It's an uncanny thing, but the strength of collective silence is probably one of the most powerful spiritual forces."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin advocates defending the human right to public silence—negotiating one music-free elevator for example, or lobbying for quiet rooms in public buildings. She also recommends starting and ending meetings with a few minutes of silence.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (Reader), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

In 1952, Ursula Franklin married Fred Franklin (born 1921), an engineer of German Jewish ancestry who had been exposed to Quakerism while living in [[United Kingdom|England]], where he had been sent to boarding school to escape the Nazis in 1936 and remained until emigrating to Canada in 1948.&lt;ref name=fred&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senecacollege.ca/media/2013/2013-03-26.html?page=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915013545/http://www.senecacollege.ca/media/2013/2013-03-26.html?page=1 |archivedate=2016-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had no family in Canada and, after their two children were born, they searched for a spiritual home and joined the Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1964.&lt;ref name=fred/&gt; "We were pacifists before we were Quakers," Franklin says, "but it was a very easy transition to Quakerism for us, and it has been a very good home and an extended family for us and our children."&lt;ref name="Speaks" /&gt; Franklin spent her last years in a nursing home with Fred, who survived her. She died on July 22, 2016 at the age of 94.&lt;ref name=cbcobit&gt;Rumley, Jonathan.

==Donation to Seneca College==
In April 2013, Franklin donated her extensive collection of writings devoted to Chinese culture and history to the Confucius Institute at [[Seneca College]] in Toronto. The collection included more than 220 texts, books, publications, and journals interpreting Chinese culture and history from the perspective of Western scholars. It also contained some of Franklin's own working papers and files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senecacollege.ca/media/2013/2013-04-25.html|title=Gift from Dr. Ursula Franklin will benefit Seneca students, faculty, and community for generations to come|publisher=Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology|accessdate=2013-04-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719181412/http://www.senecacollege.ca/media/2013/2013-04-25.html|archivedate=2013-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==

Franklin received numerous awards and honours during her long career. In 1984, she became the first woman at the University of Toronto to be named ''University Professor'',&lt;ref name="Sheinin, p.839"/&gt; a special title which is the highest honour given by the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=156|title=Ursula Franklin|publisher=science.ca|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was named Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1981 and a Companion of the Order in 1992.&lt;ref name="Order"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/honours-desc.asp?lang=e&amp;TypeID=orc&amp;id=3073|title=Honours Order of Canada|publisher=Governor General of Canada|accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=starobit /&gt; She was appointed to the [[Order of Ontario]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=cbcobit/&gt; In 1982, she was given the award of merit for the City of Toronto, mainly for her work in neighbourhood planning.&lt;ref&gt;The Order of Ontario award and Toronto's award of merit are listed in Franklin (Reader), p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; She received an honorary membership in the [[Delta Kappa Gamma]] Society International for women educators in 1985. Two years later, she was given the [[Elsie MacGill|Elsie Gregory McGill]] memorial award for her contributions to education, science and technology. In 1989, she received the Wiegand Award which recognizes Canadians who have made significant contributions to the understanding of the human dimensions of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;These three honours are listed in a postscript to Franklin's ''Real World of Technology''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, she received a [[Governor General's Award]] in Commemoration of the [[Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)|Person's Case]] for advancing the equality of girls and women in Canada. The same year, she received the [[Sir John William Dawson Medal]]. She received the 2001 [[Pearson Medal of Peace]] for her work in [[human rights]]. She has a [[Toronto]] [[high school]] named after her, [[Ursula Franklin Academy]].&lt;ref name=cbcobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These awards are listed in Lumley, p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Franklin was awarded one of Massey College's first [[Adrienne Clarkson]] Laureateships, honoring outstanding achievement in public service.&lt;ref&gt;''MasseyNews'', annual newsletter of Massey College, Toronto, 2003–2004, No. 35  (October 2004), pp. 1,  15.&lt;/ref&gt; She was inducted into the [[Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame]] in 2012.&lt;ref name = "Hall" /&gt; She received honorary degrees from more than a dozen Canadian universities including a [[Doctor of Science]] from [[Queen's University]] and a [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] from [[Mount Saint Vincent University]], both awarded in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Sheinin, p. 839&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Ernest Johnson''' (23 June 1858 – 14 January 1931), usually cited as '''W. E. Johnson''', was a British philosopher and [[logician]] mainly remembered for his ''Logic'' (1921–1924), in 3 volumes. In 1924, in volume III he introduced the important concept of [[Exchangeable random variables|exchangeability]].&lt;ref&gt;Zabell (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Johnson was born in Cambridge on 23 June 1858 to William Henry Farthing Johnson and his wife, Harriet (nee Brimley). He was their fifth child. The family were baptists and political liberals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Broad, C.D.| chapter=William Ernest Johnson|editor=Broad, C. D.|title=Ethics and the History of Philosophy|date=1952|publisher=Routledge &amp; K. Paul|location=London|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the Llandaff House School, Cambridge where his father was the proprietor and headteacher, then the Perse School, Cambridge, and the Liverpool Royal Institution School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Braithwaite|first1=R. B.|title=Johnson, William Ernest (1858–1931)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34206|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of around eight he became seriously ill and he developed severe asthma and lifelong ill health. Due to this his education was frequently disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Broad, C.D.| chapter=William Ernest Johnson|editor=Broad, C. D.|title=Ethics and the History of Philosophy|date=1952|publisher=Routledge &amp; K. Paul|location=London|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879 he entered [[King's College, Cambridge]] to read mathematics having won a scholarship and he was 11th Wrangler in 1882. He stayed on to study for the Moral Sciences Tripos from which graduated in 1883 with a First Class degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=JHN878WE|name=Johnson, William Ernest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 he married Barbara Keymer. After her sudden death in 1904 his sister Fanny moved in with him to care for his two sons

Having failed to win a prize-fellowship, he spent some time teaching mathematics. His first teaching post was as a lecturer in Psychology and Education at the Cambridge Women's Training College which he held for several years. In 1896 thanks to [[Henry Sidgwick]]'s efforts he was appointed as University lecturer at the [[University of Cambridge]]. In 1902 he was elected a [[Fellow]] of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], and Sidgwick Lecturer in Moral Sciences,.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=17 March 1902 |page_number=11 |issue=36717| }}&lt;/ref&gt; His students included [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[C.D. Broad]] and [[Dorothy Wrinch]]. He held these positions for nearly thirty years until his death in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=JHN878WE|name=Johnson, William Ernest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]].

He died in St Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, on 14 January 1931 and is buried at Grantchester, Cambridgeshire.

==Work==

Johnson had ill health and was a famous procrastinator and he therefore published little. His major publication was a three volume work ''Logic'' (1921–1924) which was based on his lectures. This may never have been published if it hadn't been for the efforts of Newnham student Naomi Bentwich (1891–1988). Naomi persuaded him to publish, typed and co-edited the manuscript and encouraged him to finish the project.  The preface to the first volume carries the acknowledgement:  "I  have  to  express  my  great  obligations  to  my  former  pupil,  Miss  Naomi  Bentwich,  without  whose encouragement and valuable assistance in the composition and arrangement  of  the  work,  it  would  not  have  been  produced  in  its  present form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=W. E.|title=Logic|date=1921|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Logic'' ensured his election to the British Academy but by his death it appeared dated. Johnson can be seen as a member of the British logic "old guard" pushed aside by the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Yet an article entitled "The Logical Calculus" (Johnson 1892) reveals that he had nontrivial technical capabilities in his youth, and that he was significantly influenced by the formal logical work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. The article begins as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As a material machine economises the exertion of force, so a symbolic calculus economises the exertion of intelligence ... the more perfect the calculus, the smaller the intelligence compared to the results."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[A. N. Prior]]'s ''Formal Logic'' cites this article several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prior|first1=A. N.|title=Determinables, Determinates and Determinants|journal=Mind|year=1949|volume=58|pages=1–20|jstor=2254522|doi=10.1093/mind/lviii.229.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Passmore tells us:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"His neologisms, as rarely happens, have won wide acceptance: such phrases as “ostensive definition”, such contrasts as those between ... “determinates” and “determinables”, “continuants” and “occurrents”, are now familiar in philosophical literature" ([https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.135724/2015.135724.A-Hundred-Years-Of-Philosophy#page/n347/mode/2up/search/346 Passmore, 1917, p.346])

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Johnson also wrote three papers on economics (1891; 1894; 1913). ‘The Pure Theory of Utility Curves’ (1913)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=W. E.|title=The Pure Theory of Utility Curves|journal=The Economic Journal|year=1913|volume=23|pages=483–513|jstor=2221661|doi=10.2307/2221661}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an important paper, representing "a considerable advance in the development of utility theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Baumol|editor1-first=W. J.|editor2-last=Goldfeld|editor2-first=S.N.|title=Precursors in Mathematical Economics: An Anthology|date=1968|publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science.|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was an influence on his student, [[John Maynard Keynes]]. Johnson was a colleague of Keynes's father, [[John Neville Keynes]]. He was a [[Cambridge Apostle]].
