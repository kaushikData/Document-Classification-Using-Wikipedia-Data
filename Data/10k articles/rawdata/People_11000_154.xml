'''Abel LeBlanc''' (born c. 1936) is a [[politician]] in the [[province (Canada)|province]] of [[New Brunswick]], Canada.  He was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] in [[New Brunswick general election, 2003|2003]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-votes-2014/abel-leblanc-says-he-s-not-a-new-democrat-in-his-heart-1.2771582&lt;/ref&gt;

He represented the [[electoral district]] of [[Saint John Lancaster]] as a Liberal.

LeBlanc was born in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], the son of Abel LeBlanc and Domitilde Gallant. He joined the [[Canadian Army]] and then went on to work at the Port of Saint John. On February 11, 2010, LeBlanc was expelled from the legislature following a verbal outburst, which included giving two Tory MLAs the finger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/n-b-mla-expelled-for-rude-gesture-1.925628 "N.B. MLA expelled for rude gesture"]. [[CBC News]], February 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014 the [[New Brunswick New Democratic Party]] announced LeBlanc had joined, and that he will run as their candidate in his former riding for that year's provincial [[New Brunswick general election, 2014|election]].&lt;ref name=NDPjoin&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Liberal MLA Abel LeBlanc will run for NDP|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/ex-liberal-mla-abel-leblanc-will-run-for-ndp-1.2669385|accessdate=9 June 2014|work=CBC News|date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu al-ʿAlaʾ al-Maʿarri''' ([[Arabic]] {{rtl-lang|ar| أبو العلاء المعري}} ''{{transl|ar|Abū al-ʿAlāʾ al-Maʿarrī}}'', full name {{rtl-lang|ar|أبو العلاء أحمد بن عبد الله بن سليمان التنوخي المعري}} ''{{transl|ar|Abū al-ʿAlāʾ Aḥmad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Sulaimān al-Tanūẖī al-Maʿarrī}}''; December 973 – May 1057)&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Maarri|title=al-Ma'arri {{!}} Biography {{!}} Britannica.com|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221090622/https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Maarri|archive-date=21 February 2018|dead-url=no|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a blind Arab [[philosopher]], [[poet]], and [[writer]]. Al-Maʿarri held and expressed an [[irreligious]] [[worldview]] which was met with controversy, but in spite of it, he is regarded as one of the greatest [[Arabic poetry|classical Arabic poets]].

Born in the city of [[Maarrat al-Nu'man|Maʿarra]] during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]], he studied in nearby [[Aleppo]], then in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] and [[Antioch]]. Producing popular poems in [[Baghdad]], he nevertheless refused to sell his texts. In 1010, he returned to Syria after his mother began declining in health, and continued writing which gained him local respect.

Described as a "[[Pessimism#Philosophical pessimism|pessimistic]] [[freethinker]]", Al-Maʿarri was a controversial [[rationalist]] of his time, citing [[reason]] as the chief source of [[truth]]. He was pessimistic about life, describing himself as "a double prisoner" of [[blindness]] and [[Social isolation|isolation]]. He [[Criticism of religion|attacked the dogmas of religion]], [[Criticism of Islam|criticized]] and [[Apostasy in Islam|rejected Islam]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}, and became a [[Deism|Deist]]. He was equally critical and sarcastic about [[Criticism of Judaism|Judaism]], [[Criticism of Christianity|Christianity]], and [[Zoroastrianism]]. He advocated [[social justice]] and lived a [[Recluse|secluded]], [[ascetic]] lifestyle. He became a [[vegan]], entreating: "do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals / Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draught /
for their young".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanistictexts.org/al_ma'arri.htm "I No Longer Steal from Nature"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127200338/http://www.humanistictexts.org/al_ma'arri.htm |date=2016-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Maʿarri held an [[Antinatalism|antinatalist thought]], in line with his general pessimism, suggesting that children should not be born to spare them of the pains and [[suffering]] of life.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

Al-Maʿarri wrote three main works that were popular in his time. Among his works are ''The Tinder Spark'', ''Unnecessary Necessity'', and ''The Epistle of Forgiveness'' (''[[Resalat Al-Ghufran]]'') which may be considered a precursor to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. Al-Maʿarri never married and died at the age of 83 in the city where he was born, Maarrat al-Nuʿman. In 2013, a statue of al-Maʿarri located in his Syrian home town was beheaded by jihadists from the [[al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref name=statue /&gt;

==Life==
Abu al-ʿAlaʾ was born in [[Maʿarra]], modern [[Maarrat al-Nu'man]], Syria, near the city of [[Aleppo]], in December 973. At his time, the city was part of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the third Islamic caliphate, during the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Al-Ma'arri – Visionary Free Thinker, The Genius of Disability, The Essay |website=BBC Radio 3|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04wmklk|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the ''Banu Sulayman'', a notable family of Maʿarra, belonging to the larger [[Tanukhids|Tanukh tribe]].&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1940 {{rtl-lang|ar|أبو العلاء المعري: نسبه وأخباره وشعره ومعتقده، تأليف أحمد تيمور باشا، ص.3، ط}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Miguel Asín Palacios, ''Islam and the Divine comedy'', Routledge, 1968, {{ISBN|978-0-7146-1995-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hbHv0Hi-VbsC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=al+maarri p. 55]&lt;/ref&gt; One of his ancestors was probably the first [[qadi]] of Maʿarra. The Tanukh tribe had formed part of the aristocracy in Syria for hundreds of years and some members of the ''Banu Sulayman'' had also been noted as good poets.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 11th Century poet who pissed off al-Qaeda {{!}} All About History|url = http://www.historyanswers.co.uk/medieval-renaissance/al-maarri-the-11th-century-poet-that-pissed-off-al-qaeda/|website = historyanswers.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lost his eyesight at the age of four due to [[smallpox]]. His later pessimism may be explained by his virtual blindness. Later in his life, he regarded himself as "a double prisoner" which referred to both this blindness and the general isolation that he felt during his life.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Philip Khuri Hitti, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6FklfLSxpIkC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=al+ma%27arri#v=onepage&amp;q=al%20ma'arri&amp;f=false Islam, a Way of Life]'', page 147. University of Minnesota Press&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his career as a poet at an early age, at about 11 or 12 years old. He was educated at first in Maʿarra and Aleppo, later also in Antioch and other Syrian cities. Among his teachers in Aleppo were companions from the circle of [[Ibn Khalawayh]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This grammarian and Islamic scholar had died in 980 CE, when al-Maʿarri was still a child.&lt;ref name="al-Maarri"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Epistle of Forgiveness: Hypocrites, Heretics, and Other Sinners|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iiegAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=epistle+of+forgiveness|publisher = NYU Press|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 9780814768969|first = Abu l-Ala|last = al-Maarri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Maʿarri nevertheless laments the loss of Ibn Khalawayh in strong terms in a poem of his ''[[Resalat Al-Ghufran|Risālat al-ghufrān]]''.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_JY3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA932&amp;dq=al-ma+arri+biography|publisher = Brill Archive|date = 1954-01-01|first = Sir Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen|last = Gibb}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Qifti]] reports that when on his way to [[Tripoli]], al-Maʿarri visited a Christian monastery near [[Latakia]] where he listened to debates about [[Hellenistic philosophy]], which planted in him the seeds of his later scepticism and irreligiosity; but other historians such as [[Ibn al-Adim]] deny that he had been exposed to any theology other than Islamic doctrine.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 1004–05 al-Maʿarri learned that his father had died and, in reaction, wrote an [[elegy]] where he praised his father.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Years later he would travel to [[Baghdad]] where he became well received in the literary salons of the time, though he was a controversial figure.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; After the eighteen months in Baghdad, al-Maʿarri returned home for unknown reasons. He may have returned because his mother was ill, or he may have run out of money in Baghdad, as he refused to sell his works.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; He returned to his native town of Maʿarra in about 1010 and learned that his mother had died before his arrival.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He remained in Maʿarra for the rest of his life, where he opted for an ascetic lifestyle, refusing to sell his poems, living in seclusion and observing a strict [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Samuel Margoliouth|D. S. Margoliouth]], [https://archive.org/stream/journalroyalasi69irelgoog#page/n323/mode/1up Abu 'l-ʿAla al-Maʿarri's correspondence on vegetarianism], ''[[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]]'', 1902, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; His personal confinement to his house was only broken one time when violence had struck his town.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Though he was confined, he lived out his later years continuing his work and collaborating with others.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Abu-L-Ala al-Maarri Facts|url = http://biography.yourdictionary.com/abu-l-ala-al-maarri|website = biography.yourdictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed great respect and attracted many students locally, as well as actively holding correspondence with scholars abroad.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; Despite his intentions of living a secluded lifestyle, in his seventies, he became rich and was the most revered person in his area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Al-Maʿarri never married and died in May 1057 in his home town.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Opposition to religion===
Al-Maʿarri was a [[philosophical skepticism|sceptic]] in his beliefs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35745962|title = Museum of Lost Objects: The unacceptable poet - BBC News|website = BBC News|language = en-GB|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; who denounced superstition and dogmatism in religion. This, along with his general negative view on life, has made him described as a [[pessimism|pessimistic]] [[Freethought|freethinker]]. One of the recurring themes of his philosophy was the right of [[reason]] against the claims of custom, tradition, and authority.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Al Ma'arri|url = http://www.humanistictexts.org/al_ma'arri.htm|website = humanistictexts.org|accessdate = 2015-07-13|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161127200338/http://www.humanistictexts.org/al_ma'arri.htm|archivedate = 2016-11-27|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Maʿarri taught that religion was a "fable invented by the ancients", worthless except for those who exploit the credulous masses.&lt;ref name="Nicholson318"&gt;Reynold Alleyne Nicholson, 1962, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', page 318. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Do not suppose the statements of the prophets to be true; they are all fabrications. Men lived comfortably till they came and spoiled life. The sacred books are only such a set of idle tales as any age could have and indeed did actually produce.&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 2'', page 190. Kessinger Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Al-Maʿarri criticized many of the dogmas of [[Islam]], such as the [[Hajj]], which he called "a pagan's journey".&lt;ref name="Nicholson319"&gt;Nicholson, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', 319.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected claims of any [[divine revelation]] and his creed was that of a philosopher and ascetic, for whom [[reason]] provides a moral guide, and [[virtue]] is its own reward.&lt;ref name="Nicholson317"&gt;Nicholson, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholson323"&gt;Nicholson, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[religious skepticism|religious scepticism]] and positively [[antireligious]] views extended beyond Islam and included both [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], as well. Al-Maʿarri remarked that [[monk]]s in their [[cloister]]s or devotees in their mosques were blindly following the beliefs of their locality: if they were born among [[Magi]]ans or [[Sabians]] they would have become Magians or Sabians.&lt;ref&gt;Reynold A. Nicholson ''Adapted from Studies in Islamic Poetry'' Cambridge University Press, 1921, Cambridge, England. pp. 1–32&lt;/ref&gt; Encapsulating his view on organized religion, he once stated: "The inhabitants of the earth are of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains."&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Glasse, (2001), ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 278. Rowman Altamira.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asceticism and veganism===
Al-Maʿarri was an ascetic, renouncing worldly desires and living secluded from others while producing his works. He opposed all forms of violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Baghdad, while being well received, he decided not to sell his texts, which made it difficult for him to live.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; This ascetic lifestyle has been compared to similar thought in [[India]] during his time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In al-Maʿarri's later years, he became a [[vegan]], neither consuming meat nor any other animal products. He wrote:
{{poemquote|Do not unjustly eat fish the water has given up,
And do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals,
Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draught
for their young, not noble ladies.
And do not grieve the unsuspecting birds by taking eggs;
for injustice is the worst of crimes.
And spare the honey which the bees get industriously
from the flowers of fragrant plants;
For they did not store it that it might belong to others,
Nor did they gather it for bounty and gifts.
I washed my hands of all this; and wish that I
Perceived my way before my hair went gray!&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;}}

=== Antinatalism ===
Al-Maʿarri's fundamental [[pessimism]] is expressed in his antinatalist recommendation that no children should be begotten, so as to spare them the pains of life.&lt;ref name="statue"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Syrian rebels have taken iconoclasm to new depths, with shrines, statues and even a tree destroyed – but to what end?|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/syrian-rebels-have-taken-iconoclasm-to-new-depths-with-shrines-statues-and-even-a-tree-destroyed--but-to-what-end-9021017.html|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[elegy]] composed by him over the loss of a relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life:
{{poemquote|Soften your tread. Methinks the earth's surface is but bodies of the dead,
Walk slowly in the air, so you do not trample on the remains of God's servants.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;}}
Even on al-Maʿarri's [[epitaph]], he wanted it written that his life was a wrong done by his father and not one that was done by himself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Modern views==
Al-Maʿarri is controversial even today as he was sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the [[al-Nusra Front]], a branch of [[al-Qaeda]], beheaded a statue of al-Maʿarri during the [[Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from the fact that he was a heretic to the fact that he is believed by some to be related to the [[Assad family]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[[France24]], "[http://observers.france24.com/content/20130214-jihadists-behead-statue-syrian-poet-abul-ala-al-maari Jihadists behead statue of Syrian poet Abul Ala al-Maari]", 14 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, al-Maʿarri is sometimes referred to as one of the greatest classical Arab poets. Some have drawn connections between him and the Roman poet [[Lucretius]], calling them progressive for their time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Works ==
{{listen |filename=Poem by Abu 'ala al-Ma'arri ("I no longer steal from nature") read in Arabic.ogg|title=Poem from Luzūmīyāt, read in Arabic|description=The restrictive rhyme and meter can be heard in the start of poem 197&lt;ref&gt;[[Reynold Nicholson]], [https://archive.org/stream/studiesinislamic00nichuoft#page/134/mode/2up Studies in Islamic Poetry and Mysticism], 1921, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An early [[Diwan (poetry)|collection]] of his poems appeared as ''The Tinder Spark'' (''Saqṭ al-zand''; {{rtl-lang|ar|سقط الزند}}). The collection of poems included praise of notable people of Aleppo and the [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid]] ruler [[Sa'd al-Dawla]]. It gained great popularity and established his reputation as a poet. A few poems in the collection were about armour.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

A second, more original collection appeared under the title ''Unnecessary Necessity'' (''Luzūm mā lam yalzam'' {{rtl-lang|ar|  لزوم ما لا يلزم أو اللزوميات }}), also simply ''Luzūmīyāt'' or ''Necessities''. The title refers to how al-Maʿarri saw the business of living and alludes to the unnecessary complexity of the rhyme scheme used.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

His third famous work is a work of prose known as ''The Epistle of Forgiveness'' (''[[Resalat Al-Ghufran]]'' {{rtl-lang|ar|رسالة الغفران}}).
The work was written as a direct response to the Arabic poet Ibn al-Qarih, whom al-Maʿarri mocks for his religious views.&lt;ref name="al-Maarri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Epistle of Forgiveness: Volume Two: Hypocrites, Heretics, and Other Sinners|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780814768969|publisher = NYU Press|date = 2014|location = New York|isbn = 9780814768969|first = Abu l-Ala|last = al-Maarri|first2 = Geert Jan Van|last2 = Gelder|first3 = Gregor|last3 = Schoeler}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, the poet visits [[Jannah|paradise]] and meets the [[Arabic poetry|Arab poets]] of the [[Jahiliyyah|pagan period]], contrary to Muslim doctrine which holds that only those who believe in God can find [[Salvation#Islam|salvation]].
Because of the aspect of [[Bangsian fantasy|conversing with the deceased]] in paradise, the ''Resalat Al-Ghufran'' has been compared to the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of Dante&lt;ref&gt;William Montgomery Watt and Pierre Cachia, ''A History of Islamic Spain'', 2nd edition, Edinburgh University Press, 1996, pp. 125–126, {{ISBN|0-7486-0847-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which came hundreds of years after. The work has also been noted to be similar to Ibn Shuhayd's ''Risala al-tawabi' wa al-zawabi'', though there is no evidence that al-Maʿarri was inspired by Ibn Shahayd nor is there any evidence that Dante was inspired by al-Maʿarri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Biographical Encyclopedia of Islamic Philosophy|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iX-8BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT364&amp;lpg=PT364&amp;dq=al+qifti+al-ma+arri|publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing|date = 2015-07-16|isbn = 9781472569462|first = Oliver|last = Leaman}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algeria]] reportedly banned ''The Epistle of Forgiveness'' from the International Book Fair held in [[Algiers]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

''Paragraphs and Periods'' (''Al-Fuṣūl wa al-ghāyāt'') is a collection of homilies. The work has also been called a [[parody]] of the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

'''Benjamin Eugene Quayle''' (born November 5, 1976)&lt;ref name=directory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=Q000024|title=QUAYLE, Ben|work=[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American lawyer and politician who is a former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|AZ|3}}. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he is the son of 44th [[Vice President of the United States]] [[Dan Quayle]]. He is a member of the [[Tea Party movement]], which had many of its members swept into office during the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/family-life-and-consulting-work-are-filling-ben-quayle-s-time-in-phoenix-20130827 |title=Family Life and Consulting Work Are Filling Ben Quayle's Time in Phoenix |publisher=NationalJournal.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to serving in [[United States Congress|Congress]] he worked as an associate lawyer and eventually founded his own security company as well as writing for the Scottsdale gossip blog, ''The Dirty''. In the 2010 Republican primary he defeated 10 other candidates and went on to win a majority in the general election. In his first bid for re-election, due to [[2010 United States Census|redistricting]], he faced a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challenge from fellow Representative [[David Schweikert]], ultimately losing the seat in the primary. He currently works for the lobbying firm Clark Hill.&lt;ref name="thehill1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/307343-former-rep-ben-quayle-joins-lobby-firm |title=Former Rep.

==Early life, education, and career==
Quayle was born in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] on November 5, 1976, three days after his father was first elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=observed&gt;{{cite news|date=2010-02-12|work=Fort Wayne Observed|title=Quayle to Run for Congress in 3rd District ... of Arizona|url=http://indiana.typepad.com/fwob/2010/02/quayle-to-run-for-congress-in-3rd-district-of-arizona.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Quayle frequently visited the [[White House]] with his family during the [[Reagan administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/48915.html |title=Opinion: President Reagan's jelly beans – Rep. Ben Quayle |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quayle moved to the [[Phoenix, Arizona]] area with his family in 1996. Quayle graduated from [[Duke University]] in 1998 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in history and earned his [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Vanderbilt University Law School]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=directory/&gt; Quayle has been admitted to the Arizona, New York, and California bar.

Quayle worked as an associate lawyer at [[Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel]] from 2004 to 2005, and [[Snell &amp; Wilmer]] from 2006 to 2007. In 2007, Quayle founded Tynwald Capital, a firm specializing in the acquisition and nurturing of small businesses.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|date=2010-02-12|work=[[CNN]]|title=Former Vice President's son running for Congress|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/02/12/former-vice-presidents-son-running-for-congress/?fbid=9QrjVLRQLmm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quayle was a founding member of APG-Southwest, a full-service provider of security services for businesses, for which he served as the managing partner of its Arizona branch. Quayle currently works for the Washington lobbying firm Clark Hill.&lt;ref name="thehill1"/&gt;

===Elections===
;2010
After Republican Congressman [[John Shadegg]] decided to retire, Quayle launched his campaign following his father's announcement on ''[[America Live with Megyn Kelly]]'' that Ben was a candidate for {{ushr|AZ|3}}.&lt;ref name=azcentral&gt;{{cite news|date=February 16, 2010|title=Ben Quayle, son of ex-veep, running for Shadegg's seat|url=http://www.azcentral.com/members/Blog/azdc/73856|publisher=Azcentral.com|accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 11, 2010, Quayle released an advertisement in which he called [[Barack Obama]] the "worst President in history".&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|date=August 13, 2010|title=Quayle stands by 'worst president in history' critique|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/13/quayle-stands-by-worst-president-in-history-critique/|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|date=August 11, 2010|title=Best 2010 Candidate Storyline: This Guy, Ben Quayle|url=http://swampland.blogs.time.com/2010/08/11/best-2010-candidate-storyline-this-guy-ben-quayle/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Former VP's son dubs Obama "worst president in history"|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/08/12/4875573-former-vps-son-dubs-obama-worst-president-in-history|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815041800/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/08/12/4875573-former-vps-son-dubs-obama-worst-president-in-history|archivedate=2010-08-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|date=August 11, 2010|title=Ben Quayle: Obama 'the worst president in history'|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/08/ben-quayle-the-worst-president.html | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Political Wire"&gt;{{cite news|date=August 13, 2010|title=Mocking Quayle|url=http://politicalwire.com/archives/2010/08/13/mocking_quayle.html|publisher=Politicalwire.com|accessdate=2015-03-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118195752/http://politicalwire.com/archives/2010/08/13/mocking_quayle.html|archivedate=November 18, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quayle's prior involvement with the controversial rumor and gossip website "DirtyScottsdale.com" complicated his run for office. According to the site's founder, Quayle was one of the "original contributors" to the site, which covered Scottsdale nightlife with features including sexy photos of women, and was the predecessor to the gossip website TheDirty.com.&lt;ref name="Voices.washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/08/ben-quayle-denies-writing-for.html |title=44 – Ben Quayle admits writing for 'Dirty Scottsdale' Web site |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quayle initially denied the rumors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/40893.html |title=Ben Quayle denies link to Dirty Scottsdale website – Kasie Hunt and Scott Wong |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; before admitting several weeks later that he did, in fact, write material for the site using the [[pen name]] '''Brock Landers'''.&lt;ref name="Voices.washingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ktar.com/?sid=1325150&amp;nid=6 |title=Racy website link hurting Ben Quayle |date=16 August 2010 |publisher=KTAR |accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/25/quayle-still-on-the-attack-in-arizona/ | work=CNN | title=Quayle still on the attack in Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/40937.html |title=Ben Quayle changes story on website – Scott Wong |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101106133457/http://www.politico.com//news//stories//0810//40937.html| archivedate= 6 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quayle won the 10-candidate Republican primary on August 24, 2010 with a plurality of 23% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=512834 |title=AZ District 03 – R Primary Race – Aug 24, 2010 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the general election in November, Quayle defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Jon Hulburd]] 52%–41%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=487768 |title=AZ – District 03 Race – Nov 02, 2010 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2012
After redistricting, Quayle's district was renumbered as the {{ushr|AZ|6|6th district}}, while his home in Phoenix was drawn into the {{ushr|AZ|9|9th district}}. However, Quayle's home was just a few yards outside the 6th, leading a source close to Quayle to tell ''[[National Journal]]'' that Quayle would run in his original district.&lt;ref name=nj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/10/house-democrats.php|title=House Democrats Gain With New Arizona Map|date=October 5, 2011|accessdate=October 7, 2011|work=[[National Journal]]|first=Jessica|last=Taylor|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006163330/http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/10/house-democrats.php|archivedate=October 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the 6th is as heavily Republican as its predecessor, the 9th was drawn as a fair-fight district.

On February 6, 2012; Quayle confirmed that he would indeed run in the 6th. Quayle faced fellow freshman Republican Congressman [[David Schweikert]] in the Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district. In an unusual twist, Schweikert's home in [[Fountain Hills, Arizona|Fountain Hills]] had been drawn into the 6th, while as mentioned above Quayle's home had been drawn into the 9th, the geographic successor to Schweikert's 5th.&lt;ref name=rc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/quayle-chooses-to-run-against-schweikert/|title=Arizona: Quayle Opts to Run Against Schweikert|date=February 6, 2012|accessdate=February 7, 2012|work=[[Roll Call]]|first=Abby|last=Livingston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan |first=Sean |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/08/29/schweikert-beats-quayle-in-arizona/ |title=Schweikert defeats Quayle in Arizona |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2012-08-29 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the bitter primary campaign, Schweikert was widely criticised for a mailer that accused Quayle of "going both ways", suggesting that he was [[bisexual]]. On the reverse, the mailer listed issues on which it claimed Quayle had taken both liberal and conservative positions. Senator [[Jon Kyl]] said that "such campaign tactics insult the voters, degrade politics and expose those who stoop to them as unworthy of high office" and Senator [[John McCain]] said the mailer was one of the "worst that I have seen" and that it "crosses the boundary of decent political dialogue and discourse". Quayle's spokeswoman called the mailer "utterly false" and "a sleazy smear tactic". Schweikert's spokesman responded that people "should get their minds out of the gutter" because the mailer was "obviously" referring to "both ways – as in liberal and conservative". ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' asked two political scientists to review the mailer, who both said that they had "never seen anybody accuse someone of flip-flopping [on political issues] that way" and said that it was "difficult to believe" that the sexual suggestion was unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/08/08/schweikert-quayle-goes-both-ways-on-important-conservative-issues/ |title=Schweikert says Quayle 'goes both ways' |publisher=The Daily Caller |date=2012-08-08 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2012/08/06/kyl-faults-schweikert-after-mailer.html |title=Kyl faults Schweikert after mailer says Quayle 'goes both ways' – Phoenix Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2012-08-06 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nowicki |first=Dan |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2012/08/03/20120803district-6-schweikert-like-fight-in-dc.html |title=District 6 race: David Schweikert says 'I like the fight' in D.C |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2012-08-03 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://archive.azcentral.com/members/Blog/azdc/169420 |title=azcentral.com staff blogs – AZ/DC Blog – azdc – McCain endorses Quayle, scolds Schweikert for mailer |publisher=Archive.azcentral.com |date=2012-08-15 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/243973-mccain-blasts-arizona-republican-who-accused-quayle-of-going-both-ways |title=McCain blasts Arizona Republican who accused Quayle of ‘going both ways’ |publisher=TheHill |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the 6th contained almost two-thirds of Quayle's constituents, Schweikert defeated Quayle in the Republican primary by 53 percent to Quayle's 47 percent.&lt;ref name="primary"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zapler |first=Mike|last2=Isenstadt|first2=Alex|title=Arizona House primary results: Ben Quayle booted from Congress|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80331.html?hp=r2 |newspaper=Politico |date=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Jette, a business professor at the [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]] who ran for [[List of Governors of Arizona|Governor of Arizona]] as a Republican in [[Arizona gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]], won the Democratic nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/usatoday/article/38760165|title=1st Democrat announces run for Ariz. 6th District|date=March 9, 2012|accessdate=March 9, 2012|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[Wausau Daily Herald]]|first=Bob|last=Christie}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schweikert defeated Jette in the November 6, 2012, general election with 62% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/2012-election/map/#/House/2012/AZ |title=2014 Election Results Senate: Map by State, Live Midterm Voting Updates |publisher=Politico |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
After being elected to Congress, Quayle announced that he would opt out of the taxpayer funded Congressional health care and pension plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2011-12-09|work=Washington Times|title=EDITORIAL: Make congressional pensions passe|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/dec/9/make-congressional-pensions-passe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Quayle was named "The Most Conservative Member of the House of Representatives" by the [[National Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2012-02-23|work=National Journal|title=Most Conservative Members of Congress|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/most-liberal-most-conservative-20120223}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the 2011 "National Taxpayers’ Friend Award"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2012-04-30|title=NTU Presents Taxpayer Friend Awards|url=http://www.ntu.org/governmentbytes/ntu-presents-taxpayer-friend.html|publisher=Ntu.org|accessdate=2015-03-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227110725/http://ntu.org/governmentbytes/ntu-presents-taxpayer-friend.html|archivedate=2012-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[National Taxpayers Union]], the "Spirit of Enterprise Award"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spirit of Enterprise Awards 2011|url=http://www.uschamber.com/issues/legislators/spirit-enterprise-awards-2011|publisher=Uschamber.com|accessdate=2015-03-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313074953/https://www.uschamber.com/issues/legislators/spirit-enterprise-awards-2011|archivedate=2014-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], and was given a 98% scorecard &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congressional Scorecard|url=http://www.clubforgrowth.org/projects/scorecard/?year=2011&amp;chamber=2&amp;state=Any&amp;party=Any&amp;memberName=quayle|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414125118/http://www.clubforgrowth.org/projects/scorecard/?year=2011&amp;chamber=2&amp;state=Any&amp;party=Any&amp;memberName=quayle|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-04-14|publisher=Clubforgrowth.org|accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Club for Growth]].

Controversy arose after a bill to increase combat pay for military personnel was rejected, and Quayle and [[David Schweikert]] [[high-five]]d, happy about the bill's failure. After the incident, Maria Meacham, the mother of an active-duty soldier upset about the vote, began shouting from the gallery, and was removed by [[United States Capitol Police|security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/maria-meacham-gets-arrested-in-dc-2012-9|title=Congressmen High-Fived After Blocking A Military Pay Raise, And Then Arrested An Army Mom|author=Geoffrey Ingersoll|date=September 19, 2012|accessdate=January 6, 2013|work=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quayle introduced legislation related to border security, guns, small business, government transparency, and health care&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Library of Congress|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/home/thomas.php|publisher=Thomas.loc.gov|accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully sponsored H.R. 3862, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act "to impose certain limitations on consent decrees and settlement agreements by agencies that require the agencies to take regulatory action in accordance with the terms thereof, and for other purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3862/text/ih |title=Text of H.R. 3862 (112th): Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2012 (Introduced version) |publisher=GovTrack.us |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Congressional Budget Office]], "Under the bill, complaints against federal agencies, the terms of the consent decrees or settlement agreements, and the award of attorneys’ fees would need to be published in an accessible manner, including electronically. The legislation would require that any proposed consent decree or settlement agreement be published in the Federal Register for 60 days of public comment prior to filing with the court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43351 |title=H.R. 3862, Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2012 &amp;#124; Congressional Budget Office |publisher=Cbo.gov |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Harvey Hill''' (September 14, 1823 &amp;ndash; August 16, 1882) was a politician whose career spanned state and national politics, and the Civil War. He served in the Georgia legislature in both houses. Although he had opposed secession, he stayed with the South and served as a [[Confederate States Senate|Confederate senator]] representing Georgia. 

After the war and near the end of the [[Reconstruction era]], Hill was elected in 1874 to the [[United States House of Representatives]], and in 1877 as a [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] from Georgia. He served in the Senate until his death in 1882.

==Early life==
Hill was born September 14, 1823, in [[Hillsboro, Georgia]], in [[Jasper County, Georgia|Jasper County]]. He was of [[Welsh American|Welsh]] and [[Ireland|Irish American]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;''Senator Benjamin H. Hill of Georgia: his life, speeches and writings'', page 9&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended the [[University of Georgia]] in [[Athens, Georgia]], where he was a member of the [[Demosthenian Literary Society]]. He graduated in 1844 with first honors. He was admitted to the Georgia bar later in 1844. He married Caroline E. Holt in [[Athens, Georgia]] in 1845.

==Early career==
[[File:Bellevue (LaGrange, Georgia).JPG|thumb|left|alt=Bellevue plantation house|Hill's home, [[Bellevue (LaGrange, Georgia)|Bellevue]]]]
As a politician, Hill was affiliated with a number of parties, reflecting the volatile politics before and after the [[American Civil War]]. He was elected to the state legislature of Georgia in 1851 as a member of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. He supported [[Millard Fillmore]] running on the [[Know-Nothing]] ticket in 1856, and was an elector for that party in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. In 1857, he ran for governor of Georgia unsuccessfully against the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Joseph E. Brown]]. In 1859, he was elected to the state senate as a [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionist]]. In 1860, he was again an elector, this time for [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] and the [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionist]] party.

Hill was known as {{anchor|the peerless orator}}"the peerless orator" for his skill in delivering speeches,&lt;ref&gt;Candler, Allen Daniel (1909). [https://books.google.com/books?id=D3QOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA757 ''The Confederate records of the State of Georgia, Volume 1'']. Atlanta, GA: C. P. Byrd publishing. {{ISBN|978-1147068887}}. Retrieved July 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and he was the only non-Democratic member of the [[Ordinance of Secession|Georgia secession convention]] on January 16, 1861. He spoke publicly against the dissolution of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], along with [[Alexander Stephens]], a former opponent. Following Stephens' highly regarded argument, based on a conservative reading of the Constitution, Hill struck a more pragmatic tone. 

His arguments related to the conservative belief that disunion would ultimately lead to the abolition of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the downfall of Southern society. He quoted [[Henry Ward Beecher]], a Northern [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], who enthusiastically supported the dissolution of the Union as a means to end slavery, and described the anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] as a "disunionist" party, in contrast to the "Union men and Southern men" participating in the convention. Acknowledging the need to respond to the threat of Lincoln's election, Hill argued that his fellow Georgians should continue to resist Lincoln democratically within the bounds of the Constitution.  He compared this course to [[George Washington]], "so cool, so brave, and so thoughtful." He argued that the Northern states would eventually follow the British course of rising abolitionist thought, followed by acceptance again of slavery due to economic necessity. But he allowed that the South should prepare for secession and war if it should become necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, William W., and Craig M. Simpson, ''Secession Debated: Georgia's Showdown in 1860'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill voted against secession,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Civil War: The First Year Told by Those Who Lived It|last = |first = |publisher = The Library of America|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1-59853-088-9|location = |pages = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but became a political ally of [[Jefferson Davis]], who was elected as president of the Confederacy. When the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate government]] was formed, Hill transferred to the [[Confederate Provisional Congress]].&lt;!-- from where? --&gt; He was subsequently elected by the Georgia legislature to the [[Confederate States Senate]], a term which he held throughout its existence.

At one point in the Confederate Senate, Hill and fellow senator [[William Lowndes Yancey]] had to be separated by other members after a bloody scuffle on the floor.&lt;ref name=sf&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115231052552401057] Ferguson, Stuart, "The Zealotry of the Convert: Slavery's Firebrand Defender," book review of Eric H. Walther's ''William Lowndes Yancey and the Coming of the Civil War,'' in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 8 July 2006; page P9; accessed on July 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Hill was arrested as a Confederate official by the Union and confined in [[Fort Lafayette]] from May until July 1865.

==Later career==
Unlike many Confederate politicians, Hill had a long and distinguished career as a "reconstructed" Southerner and U.S. politician. He ultimately became a Democrat after the Civil War ended. He spoke out passionately against Radical Reconstruction and in the summer of 1867 made a series of speeches in Atlanta, the most famous being the Davis House speech of July 16, 1867, denouncing the Reconstruction Acts of 1867. His courage and eloquence enhanced his regional fame and won him national recognition.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2018}}

In 1874, he was elected to the U. S. House of Representatives, serving from May 5, 1875 - March 3, 1877. He quickly won a reputation as a spokesman for the South. He was later elected by the Georgia legislature to the U.S. Senate on January 26, 1877, as Reconstruction was ending. He served in the U.S. Senate from March 4, 1877, until his death on August 16, 1882.  His obituary was featured on the front page of the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]],'' on August 17, 1882.

==Death==
Hill is buried in historic [[Oakland Cemetery (Atlanta)|Oakland Cemetery]] in Atlanta, Georgia.

A '''body man''' or '''body woman''' is, in U.S. political jargon, a civilian [[personal assistant]] and sometimes [[valet]] to a politician or political candidate.  Such a person accompanies the politician or candidate virtually everywhere, often arranging lodging, transportation, and meals, and providing snacks, a cell phone, and any other necessary assistance.

==Critical reception==

&lt;!--Can someone from the Dragonlance project have a look at this--&gt;

As a lead designer on pre-existing products, Cam Banks was responsible for [[Margaret Weis Productions]] second ever [[Origins Award]] with ''Big Damn Heroes''.  His ''Supernatural: Guide to the Hunted'' was applauded for the design and detail work although criticized slightly for the adherence to Supernatural's canon.&lt;ref name="Flames Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flamesrising.com/guide-to-the-hunted-review/|title=Guide to the Hunted Review - Supernatural - Flames Rising Horror Webzine|work=flamesrising.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming line developer he ceased to use the [[Cortex System]], instead working with members of [[Evil Hat Productions]] to produce all the new games he created using the [[Cortex Plus]].

Reception for the Cortex Plus games has been generally positive. Both [[io9]] and RPGamer reviewed the ''[[Smallville Roleplaying Game]]'', Banks's first game as lead designer. They praised the way the game "had the heart of an independent role playing game and focused on conflict rather than powers."&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5630255/smallville-rpg-wields-big-drama|title=Smallville RPG wields big drama|author=Ed Grabianowski - Robot Viking|work=io9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RPGamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/savingthrow/reviews/rev-SV.html|title=RPGamer &gt; The Saving Throw &gt; Review|work=rpgamer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;	[[Leverage: The Roleplaying Game]] was nominated for an Origins Award, and [[Marvel Heroic Roleplaying]] won two Origins Awards and an ENnie and was praised by SF Signal for how "authentic and true to the characters the representations felt."&lt;ref name="SFSignal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2013/03/roll-perception-plus-awareness-the-marvel-heroic-roleplaying-game/|title=Roll Perception Plus Awareness: The Marvel Heroic Roleplaying Game|work=sfsignal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crystal Lynn Bowersox''' (born August 4, 1985) is an American singer, songwriter and actress who was the runner-up on the [[American Idol (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]''. She was the first female finalist in three years.

Bowersox's debut album, ''[[Farmer's Daughter (album)|Farmer's Daughter]]'', was released on December 14, 2010 by [[Jive Records]]. Bowersox released her second album, ''[[All That for This]],'' on March 26, 2013.

==Early life==
Bowersox and her twin brother, Karl, were born in [[Ottawa County, Ohio|Elliston, Ohio]]&lt;ref name="ChiTribune-04-28-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-04-28/entertainment/ct-live-0428-crystal-bowersox-2-20100428_1_bar-northwest-ohio-american-idyll |title=Where Crystal Bowersox comes from - tribunedigital-chicagotribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Kelly Lynn Bowersox (née Bowlander) and William Lester Bowersox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://birth-records.mooseroots.com/l/12460879/Crystal-Lynn-Bowersox | title=Birth Record of Crystal Lynn Bowersox | publisher=MooseRoots | accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents divorced when she was two years old.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/crystal-bowersox-554918#early-life|work=Biography Channel|title=Crystal Bowersox: Songwriter, Singer, Television Personality|accessdate=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age six, Bowersox was diagnosed with [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]].&lt;ref name=diabetes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/crystal-bowersox-her-first-interview-on-diabetes|work=Healthline|title=Crystal Bowersox: Her First Interview on Diabetes|author=Tenderich, Amy|date=September 20, 2010|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Oak Harbor High School (Ohio)|Oak Harbor High School]] in [[Oak Harbor, Ohio]] and later attended the [[Toledo School for the Arts]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="ChiTribune-04-28-10"/&gt; She was in choir and played flute in the school marching band. Bowersox performed her first professional gig at the age of 10. She appeared at local bars in Toledo, most popularly Papa's Tavern, and The Village Idiot in [[Maumee, Ohio]].

At the age of seventeen, she moved to [[Chicago]], where she played music as a [[busker]] at train stations, including the Washington and Lake Redline stops. She frequented open mics, such as the In One Ear show at the [[Heartland Cafe]], and Uncommon Ground Clark and Grace, and Devon locations. She also played extensively in Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood. According to Bowersox, she lived in [[poverty]] at this time, and had to resort to begging for [[insulin]] at a pharmacy to manage her diabetes after her health insurance expired.&lt;ref name=diabetes/&gt;

In 2006, the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs chose Bowersox to represent Chicago folk musicians in the [[Sister Cities]] program "Experience Chicago", held in [[Birmingham]]. In 2007, Bowersox traveled internationally on an independent small cafe tour, including [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Oaxaca City]], [[Ankara]] and [[Istanbul]]. She gave birth to a son, Anthony Levi Mason, in 2009;&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; according to Bowersox, his father left her six weeks into her pregnancy.&lt;ref name=diabetes/&gt;

==''American Idol''==
Bowersox auditioned for ''American Idol'' in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. She sang "[[Piece of My Heart]]." Guest judge [[Shania Twain]] commented that she had a "raw, natural talent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vancouversun.com/entertainment/Bowersox+Idol+idolize/3056262/story.html |title= Bowersox an Idol to idolize |author= Alex Strachan |publisher=[[The Vancouver Sun]] |date= May 21, 2010 |accessdate= July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2, 2010, Bowersox was hospitalized due to [[Diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA) from [[type 1 diabetes]], forcing a last minute switch in scheduling to give her extra time to recuperate. Bowersox confirmed the illness on the May 19, 2010 results show during an interview with host [[Ryan Seacrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cnmnewsnetwork.com/11618/crystal-bowersox-hospital-2010-american-idol-contestant-hospitalized-for-diabetes/ |title=Crystal Bowersox Hospital: 2010 American Idol Contestant Hospitalized for Diabetes? |author=Bella Horton |publisher=CNN |date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959174/crystal-bowersoxs-american-idol-future-uncertain |title=Crystal Bowersox's 'American Idol' Future Uncertain |agency=Associated Press |date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men competed that day instead of the women. She sang the next day and impressed all of the judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/03/04/entertainment/main6264861.shtml |title=Crystal Bowersox Wows "Idol" Judges |agency=Associated Press |date=March 4, 2010 |accessdate=March 25, 2010 |work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following week, her strong performance prompted [[Simon Cowell]] to state, "Right now, you are the one everyone has to beat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633573/20100309/story.jhtml |title=Crystal Bowersox's 'Give Me One Reason' Dominates 'American Idol' |author=James Montgomery |publisher=MTV |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Siobhan Magnus]]'s elimination from the top 6 of ''[[American Idol]]'', Bowersox became the last remaining female contestant in the competition.

Bowersox is the first female contestant to make it to the finale since [[Jordin Sparks]] won the title in 2007. She is also the first contestant in ''American Idol'' history to have one of their original songs played on the show, or at least during their hometown package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Slezak |first=Michael |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/05/22/american-idol-crystal-bowersox-lee-dewyze/ |title='Idolatry': Breaking down the Crystal-Lee finale (and bidding adieu to Casey) on 'American Idol' &amp;#124; EW.com |publisher=Popwatch.ew.com |date=May 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal's original song "Holy Toledo" was played on the May 19 Top 3 Results show as the background music for her homecoming package - when she returned to Toledo, Ohio and Elliston, Ohio the previous weekend - and segued into her live performance of the same song at "Bowerstock".

During her time on ''Idol'', Bowersox dated Tony Kusian, but the couple broke up just hours before the ''Idol'' finale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Crystal Bowersox and Boyfriend Split Before Idol Finale | publisher = People| date = May 27, 2010| url =http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20420919,00.html| accessdate = September 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the final performance day, in [[Simon Cowell]]'s final critique on ''American Idol'', he called her performance of "[[Up to the Mountain (MLK Song)|Up to the Mountain]]" "outstanding" and "by far, the best performance and song of the night".

On May 26, 2010, Bowersox was named runner-up to winner [[Lee DeWyze]]. She announced that after her ''Idol'' career, she wants to bring more awareness to type 1 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/idolchatter/post/2010/05/crystal-bowersox-and-lee-dewyze-dish-on-judges-picks-why-viewers-should-vote-for-them/1/ |title=Crystal Bowersox and Lee DeWyze dish on judges' picks, why viewers should vote for them|date=May 20, 2010|work=USA Today|accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowersox is the third ''Idol'' Runner-Up (preceded by [[Clay Aiken]] and [[David Archuleta]]) to never be in the Bottom 3 or Bottom 2.

* &lt;small&gt;{{note|1|Note 1}} Due to the judges using their one 'save' for [[Michael Lynche]], the Top 9 remained intact for another week.&lt;/small&gt;
* &lt;small&gt;{{note|2|Note 2}} Though Crystal Bowersox was the last contestant announced to be 'safe' and moving on to the Top 3, [[Ryan Seacrest]] stressed on the Top 4 Results Night that 'safe' contestants would be announced "in no particular order."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20312226_20368739.html]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515045646/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20312226_20368739.html |date=May 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the audience has no way of knowing which of the Top 3 was the second-lowest vote-getter that night after [[Michael Lynche]], who was eliminated.&lt;/small&gt;
* &lt;small&gt;{{note|3|Note 3}} Song selected by [[Ellen DeGeneres]].
&lt;/small&gt;

==Post-''Idol'' career==
On May 27, 2010, one day after Bowersox's second place ''Idol'' finish, it was announced that she had signed with [[19 Entertainment]]/[[Jive Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/arts/television/29arts-AMERICANIDOL_BRF.html?ref=todayspaper/ |title=''American Idol'' Finalists Sign Record Deals|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her single "[[Up to the Mountain (MLK Song)|Up to the Mountain]]" has since been released to radio stations and iTunes.

===2010–12: ''Farmer's Daughter''===
Bowersox's debut album, ''[[Farmer's Daughter (album)|Farmer's Daughter]]'', was released to stores and iTunes on December 14, 2010.  Bowersox performed her single "[[Farmer's Daughter (Crystal Bowersox song)|Farmer's Daughter]]" on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' on December 16, 2010.

On October 7, 2011, [[RCA Music Group]] announced it was disbanding [[Jive Records]] along with [[Arista Records]] and [[J Records]]. With the shutdown, all other artists previously signed to these three labels would see their future material released under the [[RCA Records]] brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christman |first=Ed |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/rca-s-new-executive-team-named-under-ceo-1005324782.story |title=RCA's New Executive Team Named Under CEO Peter Edge Amid Layoffs (Update) |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=August 23, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2268707 |title=Radio Industry News, Music Industry Updates, Arbitron Ratings, Music News and more! |publisher=FMQB |date= |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bowersox was not one of the artists who made the move, and was instead left without a record label.

==Career==
After leaving school, Henley joined the London [[funeral director]]'s company James H. Kenyon Ltd in 1941. Established in 1880, J. H. Kenyon Ltd were the [[Funeral directors to the Royal Household|undertakers to the Royal Household]], and had in that role assisted in arranging the funerals of many members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]]. After training in all theoretical and practical aspects of embalming, Henley passed his examinations in 1948. Four years later he was appointed the company's chief embalmer. 

In 1961, Henley became an examiner of the British Institute of Embalmers. He also taught embalming techniques, [[embalming fluid]] formulas as well as [[disaster management]] to funeral directors.&lt;ref name=christopherhenley /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.g. to Graham Cook of [http://www.albininternational.co.uk/staff Albin International] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317045515/http://www.albininternational.co.uk/staff |date=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview published in 1998, Henley expressed doubts that the [[mummification]] of [[Lenin]]'s body in Moscow was indeed as permanent as claimed by the Russian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VP2JxzGGlNwC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=desmond+henley+embalmer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l8StHxbBgt&amp;sig=92sWX2UHT4tlgz0b7Hb59wYSh7o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LZMlU-jFNYKU0AW094C4DQ&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=desmond+henley+embalmer&amp;f=false|title=Modern Mummies: The Preservation of the Human Body in the Twentieth Century|first=Christine|last=Quigley|date=1 April 1998|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=15 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
In his role as chief embalmer  for J. H. Kenyon Ltd, Henley carried out the embalming of [[George VI|King George VI]] at [[Sandringham House]] in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lafd.org.uk/funeral-service-in-london-a-short-history|title=Funeral Service in London: A Short History  - London Association of Funeral Directors|website=lafd.org.uk|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that of [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] at [[Marlborough House]] in 1953, and that of [[Sir Winston Churchill]] at the latter's London home at 28 Hyde Park Gate in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/83258331/death-state-funeral-sir-winston-leonard-spencer-churchill|title=The Death and State Funeral of Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill|website=connection.ebscohost.com|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill's body was embalmed in the same room where he had died. 

When the embalming was completed, the remains were dressed in his silk pyjamas and dressing robe and placed back into his bed. Churchill would lie in repose in private at his Hyde Park Gate home until 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm Tuesday evening when Kenyon's staff transported his remains to [[Westminster Hall]] for public viewing.&lt;ref name=ToddVanBeck&gt;Todd Van Beck, "The Death and State Funeral of Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill", part II, in ''Canadian Funeral News'' (October 2012), Vol. 40 Issue 10, p. 10 ([http://www.otcommunications.com/images/issue/oct12cfn.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316212850/http://www.otcommunications.com/images/issue/oct12cfn.pdf |date=16 March 2014 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, Henley embalmed the remains of [[Mutesa II of Buganda]]; and when [[Idi Amin]] had Mutesa II's body returned from London to Uganda in 1971, Henley was requested to accompany it.&lt;ref name=christopherhenley /&gt; In 1973, [[Aristotle Onassis]] had Henley flown to Athens in his private jet to embalm the body of his son, [[Alexander Onassis|Alexander]]. Henley also oversaw the embalming of [[Judy Garland]] in 1969, [[Jimi Hendrix]] in 1970, [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Field Marshal Lord Montgomery]] in 1976, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] in 1979, [[Bon Scott]] in 1980, and [[Billy Fury]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=christopherhenley /&gt;

In the time between 1963 and 1976, Henley also worked extensively in Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Benin and Malawi, and continued to advise royal families worldwide until his retirement from J. H. Kenyon Ltd in 1992, after 51 years of service.&lt;ref name=christopherhenley /&gt; In retirement he lived in London and Portsmouth.&lt;ref name=Robert /&gt; His funeral was held on 23 November 2005 at St. Wilfrid's Church, Portsmouth, followed by cremation at Portchester Crematorium.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

==Disaster management==

'''Eugene Alexander de Kock''' (born 29 January 1949) is a former [[South African Police]] (SAP) colonel, torturer, and [[assassin]], active under the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid government]]. Nicknamed "Prime Evil"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/10/98/truth_and_reconciliation/143668.stm The voice of 'Prime Evil'], BBC News, 28 October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2012/01/29/de-kock-must-rot-in-jail 'De Kock must rot in jail'], ''Times Live'', 29 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2010-01-11-let-prime-evil-go Let Prime Evil go], ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 11 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; by the press, de Kock was the commanding officer of C10, a [[counter-insurgency]] unit of the SAP that kidnapped, tortured, and murdered numerous anti-apartheid activists from the 1980s to the early 1990s. C10's victims included members of the [[African National Congress]].

Following South Africa's transition to democracy in 1994, de Kock disclosed the full scope of C10's crimes while testifying before the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]]. In 1996, he was tried and convicted on eighty-nine charges and sentenced to 212 years in prison. Since beginning his sentence, de Kock has accused several members of the apartheid government, including former [[State President of South Africa|state president]] [[F. W. de Klerk]], of permitting C10's activities.

==Early life and service==
Eugene Alexander de Kock was born to Lourens Vosloo de Kock, a [[magistrate]] and personal friend to former prime minister [[B. J. Vorster|John Vorster]]. Vosloo "Vossie" de Kock, Eugene's brother, later described him as a "quiet" boy who "wasn't a violent person." He also recounted how their father, a member of the [[Afrikaner Broederbond]], indoctrinated the boys in [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner nationalist]] ideology and taught them "strict [[Afrikaans]]" as they grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofwLg1vp4y0|title=South Africa's Apartheid Assassin|date=31 December 1969|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Apartheid}}

De Kock developed a long-time ambition of becoming an officer. In 1967, after finishing school, he performed his year-long national service in [[Pretoria]] at the Army Gymnasium. During this time, he and the rest of the Gymnasium's six companies were deployed to [[Rhodesia]]'s border with [[Botswana]] to militant [[African National Congress|ANC]] incursions. De Kock graduated from the Gymnasium as an infantry soldier in the [[South African Defence Force]]. However, he decided not to attend the officers college in [[Saldanha Bay]] because of a [[stutter]], and declined to pursue a B. Mil degree. He joined the [[South African Police]]'s uniform branch in the [[Eastern Cape]]. 

De Kock underwent off-duty training at Pretoria's Baviaanspoort Prison with members of the Security Police under Captain de Swart, in what later was to become the SAP's Special Task Force. In 1976, instead of accepting an invitation to train new Special Task Force members, de Kock reported to the Police College for an officers' course and was promoted from [[warrant officer]] to lieutenant. In May 1978, de Kock was transferred to [[South West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]) and joined the security branch in Oshikati. In 1979, he co-founded [[Koevoet]], an SAP [[counter insurgency]] unit tasked with combating the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN) during the [[South African Border War]]. Koevoet was regarded as a highly effective unit, but its reputation was marred by allegations of brutality towards civilians.&lt;ref name=OBrien&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=Kevin|title=The South African Intelligence Services: From Apartheid to Democracy, 1948-2005|date=2010|pages=104–110|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|isbn=978-0415433976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its successes in tracking and killing PLAN guerrillas prompted the SAP to consider setting up a similar division in South Africa.&lt;ref name=OBrien/&gt;

==Vlakplaas==
{{Main|Vlakplaas}}
In 1983, the SAP transferred de Kock to C10, a counter-insurgency unit headquartered at a farm called [[Vlakplaas]], located 20 kilometres west of Pretoria. De Kock, who had established a reputation for commitment during his tours in Rhodesia and Namibia, was promoted as the unit's commanding officer two years later. Under his leadership, C10—later known as C1—became a [[death squad]] which hunted down and killed opponents of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] and the apartheid system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pauw|first=Jacques|title=Dances with Devils|year=2007|ISBN=978-1-77007-330-2|publisher=Zebra Press|authorlink=Jacques_Pauw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TRC testimony==
De Kock first became prominent during his testimony in the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), during which he made multiple revelations relating to [[African National Congress|ANC]] deaths.

De Kock has been interviewed a number of times by [[Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela]], who ended up releasing a book, ''[[A Human Being Died That Night]]'', about her interviews with de Kock, her time on the TRC, and what causes a moral person to become a killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/psychology/pgobodo/sundaytimes.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110312225901/http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/psychology/pgobodo/sundaytimes.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 March 2011|title=The Alan Paton Awards |work=Sunday Times|date=13 June 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial, conviction, and sentencing==
Upon being convicted on 30 October 1996, de Kock was sentenced to two [[life sentence]]s plus 212 years in prison for [[crimes against humanity]]. The eighty-nine charges included six counts of murder, as well as [[conspiracy to murder]], [[attempted murder]], assault, [[kidnapping]], [[illegal possession of a firearm|illegal possession of firearms]], and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/media/1996/9610/s961029m.htm|date=29 October 1996|publisher=SAPA|title=ANC, PAC welcomes De Kock's sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Kock served his sentence in the [[C Max]] section of the [[Pretoria Central Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/De-Kock-up-for-parole-department-20111214|date=14 December 2011|publisher=News24|title=De Kock up for parole – department|accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
In a local radio interview in July 2007, de Kock claimed that former president [[FW de Klerk]]'s hands were "soaked in blood" and that de Klerk had ordered political killings and other crimes during the [[apartheid|anti-apartheid]] conflict.  These claims were in response to de Klerk's then-recent statements that he had a "clear conscience" regarding his time in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6919569.stm|date=27 July 2007|publisher=BBC|title=Jailed policeman accuses De Klerk|first=Mohammed|last=Allie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Sunday Independent (South Africa)|The Sunday Independent]]'' reported in January 2010 that de Kock was seeking a [[presidential pardon]] from [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Jacob Zuma]] in exchange for more information about the apartheid government's death squads, and that a three-hour meeting between Zuma and the incarcerated de Kock took place in April 2009.  A spokesman for Zuma denied the veracity of the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/politics/17533/eugene-de-kock-%E2%80%98looking-presidential-pardon%E2%80%99|title=Eugene de Kock ‘looking for a presidential pardon’|work=The Week UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, de Kock made several pleas for forgiveness to the relatives of his victims.  In January, he wrote a letter to the family of Bheki Mlangeni, apologising for killing the ANC attorney in a 1991 bomb attack; Mlangeni's mother, Catherine, doubted de Kock's sincerity as he had never before shown [[remorse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Eugene-de-Kock-seeks-forgiveness-20120124|title=Eugene de Kock seeks forgiveness|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February, de Kock met Marcia Khoza in his prison, confessing that he had personally executed her mother, Portia Shabangu, in an ambush in 1989; Khoza would not forgive him, because he had scarcely shown remorse during his TRC hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/daughter-of-victim-forgives-de-kock-1.1232693|title=Daughter of victim forgives De Kock|author=Independent Newspapers Online|work=Independent Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, de Kock met the Mamas, the family of another of his victims.  Candice Mama, daughter of the late Glenack Masilo Mama, did forgive De Kock, even going as far as to express in countless interviews support for his bid for parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/columnists/encounter-man-killed-father/|title=My encounter with the man who killed my father|work=City Press|date=15 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150406210254/http://www.citypress.co.za/columnists/encounter-man-killed-father/|archivedate=6 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parole===
Justice Minister [[Michael Masutha]] announced on 30 January 2015 that de Kock had been granted parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Africa apartheid assassin de Kock given parole|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-31054912|accessdate=30 January 2015|work=BBC News|date=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the press conference, it was announced that the date of his release would not be made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citizen.co.za/317665/parole-de-kock/|title=Parole for Eugene de Kock|work=The Citizen|date=30 January 2015|access-date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Masutha further said that de Kock had expressed remorse for his crimes and had co-operated with authorities to recover the remains of a number of his victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cropley|first1=Ed|title='Prime Evil' apartheid assassin wins parole in South Africa|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/30/us-safrica-apartheid-idUSKBN0L30H520150130|accessdate=30 January 2015|work=Reuters|date=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  De Kock was nevertheless to remain on parole for the rest of his life.

In April 2015, footage from Arlanda Airport dated shortly after Swedish prime minister [[Olof Palme]] was [[Murder of Olof Palme|shot to death]] re-emerged.  The blurry images appear to show a man similar to Eugene de Kock, which is notable as de Kock himself claimed the South African security services were involved in the assassination.  His lawyer has strongly denied that de Kock was in Sweden at that time or that he has ever visited Sweden.  (South African spy [[Craig Williamson]] was present in Stockholm at the time of the assassination, however, possibly to surveil an ANC conference held in Stockholm.)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article20615614.ab&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directing, writing and producing===
Akhtar made his writing and directorial debut with the critically acclaimed film ''[[Dil Chahta Hai]]'' (2001), produced by [[Excel Entertainment|Excel Entertainment Pvt.

R.

Akhtar's next project was ''[[Lakshya (film)|Lakshya]]'' (2004), a film about an aimless youngster finally setting a goal for himself, starring [[Hrithik Roshan]] and [[Preity Zinta]]. It was shot in Ladakh, [[Dehra Dun]] and Mumbai, and marked the beginning of the collaborations between Akhtar and Hrithik.&lt;ref name="RF1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2004/apr/08farhan.htm |title=Lakshya is about Hrithik, about finding yourself |publisher=[[Rediff]] |first=Syed Firdaus |last=Ashraf |date=8 April 2004 |accessdate=19 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607050325/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2004/apr/08farhan.htm |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had to research the army before writing the script and directing the venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/More-painful-times-ahead-for-Farhan/articleshow/12649181.cms |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715170035/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/More-painful-times-ahead-for-Farhan/articleshow/12649181.cms |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 July 2012 |title=More painful times ahead for Farhan! |work=The Times of India |date=13 April 2012 |accessdate=13 April 2012 |first=Subhash K. |last=Jha |agency=Indo-Asian News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the film, as stated by Akhtar, was about "finding oneself". He also believed that if the same characters and situation were set elsewhere, the main core of the story would remain the same as the film was not about war, as it had been reported.&lt;ref name="RF1"/&gt; Post-release, the film failed to make a mark at the box office and became a commercial failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=210&amp;catName= |title=Box Office 2004 |publisher=Box office India |accessdate=18 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830151943/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=210 |archivedate=30 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parul Gupta of ''[[The Times of India]]'' gave it a negative review and explained that "It's hard to reconcile to such triviality when it comes from Farhan Akhtar, considered the ultimate symbol of cool in Hindi filmdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-06-18/movie-reviews/27170093_1_preity-zinta-hrithik-roshan-romila |title=Lakshya: Farhan misses target |work=The Times of India |first=Parul |last=Gupta |date=18 June 2004 |accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, Manish Gajjar from ''[[BBC]]'' wrote, in his positive review: "Young Farhan Akhtar, proves yet again that he is one of the finest directors Bollywood has to date. He has paid full attention to the script and the technical aspects, giving rise to a polished product".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/films/bollywood/2004/06/lakshya_review.shtml |title=Lakshya review |work=BBC |accessdate=18 March 2012 |first=Manish |last=Gajjar |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617041624/http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/films/bollywood/2004/06/lakshya_review.shtml |archivedate=17 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Akhtar wrote the English lyrics of [[Gurinder Chadha]]'s Hollywood film ''[[Bride and Prejudice]]'' (2004), along with his sister, Zoya Akhtar, after being recommended by his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?223942 |title=Farhan Akhtar |work=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]] |first=Saumya |last=Roy |date=17 May 2004 |accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music for the film was composed by [[Anu Malik]] and consisted of a mixture of ''[[Bollywood songs|Hindi songs]]'', ''[[West side story]]'', ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2003-04-28/news/27544303_1_aishwarya-rai-bride-and-prejudice-indian-market |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707004032/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2003-04-28/news/27544303_1_aishwarya-rai-bride-and-prejudice-indian-market |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2012 |title=Bride And Prejudice finds a Kiwi groom! |work=[[The Economic Times]] |date=28 April 2003 |accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Akhtar directed, produced and wrote the screenplay of ''[[Don (2006 Hindi film)|Don]]'' starring [[Shah Rukh Khan]] in the title role, a remake of ''[[Don (1978 film)|1978 film Don]]'', starring [[Amitabh Bachchan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/cast/id/534291/Don+-+The+Chase+Begins+Again |title=Don&amp;nbsp;— The Chase Begins Again Cast &amp; Crew |publisher=Bollywood Hungama |accessdate=19 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526010131/http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/cast/id/534291/Don+-+The+Chase+Begins+Again |archivedate=26 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It marked his first project holding the status of a remake. The character of [[Don (character)|Don]] became iconic and popular. Despite this, he noted that he did not mean to be a "torchbearer of the remake brigade" and did not feel comfortable with being credited for the trend of remakes in the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2006/oct/17farhan.htm |title=Farhan, his dad and the Don |publisher=Rediff |first1=Prem |last1=Panicker |first2=Raja |last2=Sen |date=17 October 2006 |accessdate=19 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020091131/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2006/oct/17farhan.htm |archivedate=20 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film released on 20 October 2006 and was declared a "hit" at the box office, grossing around {{INR}}105 crore worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/arounddetail.php?page=shownews&amp;articleid=3997&amp;nCat=&lt; |title=Box Office worldwide |accessdate=27 January 2009 |publisher=Box office India |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105215110/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/arounddetail.php?page=shownews&amp;articleid=4409&amp;nCat= |archivedate=5 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became widely known for its dialogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sify.com/movies/memorable-dialogues-from-don-news-bollywood-kkfviaiciif.html |title=Memorable dialogues from Don |publisher=[[Sify]] |date=27 September 2006 |accessdate=19 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225123052/http://www.sify.com/movies/memorable-dialogues-from-don-news-bollywood-kkfviaiciif.html |archivedate=25 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics predominantly condemned Akhtar's direction and screenplay. [[Taran Adarsh]] of [[Bollywood Hungama]] said Akhtar had "climbed the ladder as far as craftsmanship is concerned [every frame is well decorated and makes a spellbinding impact] but despite a readymade classic at his disposal, the storyteller just doesn't get it right this time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/534291 |title=Don&amp;nbsp;— The Chase Begins Again |publisher=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |first=Taran |last=Adarsh |authorlink=Taran Adarsh |date=20 October 2006 |accessdate=19 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607030108/http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/534291 |archivedate=7 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Akhtar produced the film ''[[Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd.]]'', directed by debutant [[Reema Kagti]] and starring [[Abhay Deol]], [[Minissha Lamba]], [[Shabana Azmi]] and [[Boman Irani]]. The music for the film was composed by [[Vishal-Shekhar]], marking their first collaboration with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/cast/id/514805 |title=Honeymoon Travels Pvt Ltd.

It also introduced [[Arjun Mathur]] in the film industry. Speaking about the purpose of the project, Akhtar stated that "Just as a social stigma, many people believe that an HIV patient should be isolated. They also have certain misconceptions about dealing with the disease. And since India has a lot of joint families, it becomes very important for them to understand the value of support to the person who has acquired this disease. This is exactly what Positive talks about." The film had its background score composed by [[Ram Sampath]] but had no soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sify.com/movies/image-farhan-akhtar-s-positive-outlook-on-hiv-news-bollywood-kkfuzUijbhf.html |title=Image: Farhan Akhtar's Positive outlook on HIV |publisher=Sify |author=Bollywood Hungama |date=18 October 2007 |accessdate=20 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001190736/http://www.sify.com/movies/image-farhan-akhtar-s-positive-outlook-on-hiv-news-bollywood-kkfuzUijbhf.html |archivedate=1 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a part of the "AIDS JaaGo" ("AIDS Awake"), a series of four short films, directed by [[Mira Nair]], Santosh Sivan, [[Vishal Bhardwaj]] and himself, in a joint initiative of Mira Nair's [[Mirabai Films]], voluntary organisations Avahan and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/jan/22mira.htm |title=Mira Nair, Farhan Akhtar to make films on AIDS |publisher=Rediff |date=31 December 2004 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305171037/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/jan/22mira.htm |archivedate=5 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akhtar's first project in 2011 was the [[Drama film|drama]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] ''[[Game (2011 film)|Game]]'', directed by [[Abhinay Deo]]. The lead cast consisted of [[Abhishek Bachchan]], [[Kangana Ranaut]], Boman Irani and [[Jimmy Shergill]].

Later that year, Akhtar wrote, produced and directed ''[[Don 2]]'', a sequel to his 2006 ''Don''. It marked his return to direction after a gap of nearly 5 years. His decision of making a sequel was explained by him in an interview: "I am wary of sequels having to be made. With ''Don 2'' I could finally make an action thriller the way I wanted to. Good story, classic action and simple plot which has one goal and work towards it effectively and dramatically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report_don-2-will-touch-upon-don-s-past-farhan-akhtar_1623284 |title=Don 2 will touch upon Don's past: Farhan Akhtar |work=DNA India |date=8 December 2011 |accessdate=21 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125064818/http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report_don-2-will-touch-upon-don-s-past-farhan-akhtar_1623284 |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a major success in India and went on to become the year's highest-grossing Bollywood production abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boxofficeindia.com/boxnewsdetail.php?page=shownews&amp;articleid=3886&amp;nCat= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108080927/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/boxnewsdetail.php?page=shownews&amp;articleid=3886&amp;nCat= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 January 2012 |title=Don 2 Top Overseas Grosser 2011 |publisher=Box Office India |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a worldwide gross of {{INR}}210 crore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/high-and-mighty-list-pawan-munjal-shah-rukh-khan-rahul-bhatia-ruias-malvinder-mohan-sajjan-jindal/1/183366.html |title=High and Mighty 2012: Rank 23 to 32 |work=India Today |date=7 April 2012 |accessdate=28 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529015241/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/high-and-mighty-list-pawan-munjal-shah-rukh-khan-rahul-bhatia-ruias-malvinder-mohan-sajjan-jindal/1/183366.html |archivedate=29 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It received mixed to positive reviews from critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/features/2011/don-2-mixed-reviews-film-critcs-verdict-241211.html |title=Don 2 receives mixed reviews from film critics |publisher=[[Oneindia.in]] |date=24 December 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112173906/http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/features/2011/don-2-mixed-reviews-film-critcs-verdict-241211.html |archivedate=12 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Khalid Mohammed]] stating: "Throughout, you can’t help feeling that Farhan Akhtar could have made three far more valuable films out of the budget squandered on this thriller where cars are smashed as if they were tea cups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/showbiz/bollywood/don-2-review-what-yawn-2-879 |title=Don 2 review: What a Yawn 2! |work=[[Deccan Chronicle]] |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2012 |first=Khalid |last=Mohammed |authorlink=Khalid Mohammed |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208095043/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/showbiz/bollywood/don-2-review-what-yawn-2-879 |archivedate=8 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting and singing===
In 2008, Akhtar made his acting and singing debut in a musical film titled ''[[Rock On!!]]'', for which he wrote the dialogues and also produced. The film was directed by [[Abhishek Kapoor]]. [[Prachi Desai]], [[Arjun Rampal]] and [[Purab Kohli]] co-starred along with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/rock-on/cast/ |title=Rock On!!

The role played by him was that of Aditya, lead singer of the rock band "Magik". He sang five songs for the soundtrack album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080803/jsp/graphiti/story_9633305.jsp |title=Rock on, Farhan |work=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)]] |first=Aarti |last=Dua |date=3 August 2008 |accessdate=20 March 2012 |location=Kolkata, India |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008040807/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080803/jsp/graphiti/story_9633305.jsp |archivedate=8 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was acclaimed by critics and received positive reviews upon release. Gaurav Malani of ''[[The Economic Times]]'' wrote that the film seemed to be "clearly designed by Farhan Akhar as his own acting debut and he doesn't let himself down. Lending voice to all his songs helps him to get into his character with effortless ease. One could certainly overlook the lisp in his dialogue delivery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-08-29/news/27695630_1_rock-concert-abhishek-kapoor-farhan-akhtar |title=Rock On: Movie Review |work=The Economic Times |first=Gaurav |last=Malani |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manish Gajjar of ''BBC'' wrote of his performance: "Director-turned-actor, Farhan Aktar surprises all with his superb, flawless performance, transforming from a hippy-style lead-singer to a subdued, dismal workaholic banker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--lead container name--&gt;Rock OnReview by Manish Gajjar |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/content/articles/2008/09/05/bollywood_reviews_rock_on_feature.shtml |title=Shropshire&amp;nbsp;— Entertainment&amp;nbsp;— Rock On |publisher=BBC |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213155553/http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/content/articles/2008/09/05/bollywood_reviews_rock_on_feature.shtml |archivedate=13 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Akhtar received several accolades for his debut performance. The film, in addition won the National Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. However, it did not create an impact at the box office and turned out to be an "average" grosser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=215&amp;catName=MjAwOA== |title=Box Office 2008 |accessdate=27 January 2009 |work= |publisher=BoxOffice India |date= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mZotkwed?url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=215&amp;catName=MjAwOA== |archivedate=6 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Luck By Chance'', Akhtar acted in a project titled ''[[The Fakir of Venice]]'', which was initially scheduled to release before ''Rock on!!'' and was supposed to be his acting debut. Due to several delays, it was released in mid-2009. It was written and directed by Anand Surapur, and accepted by Akhtar after he described its script as "very powerful", while emphasising that it "touches upon weaknesses and confusions in all human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?240656 |title=Farhan Akhtar |work=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]] |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=7 May 2012 |first=Lata |last=Khubchandani}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before release, it premiered at the [[Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-05-07/news-interviews/28155751_1_farhan-akhtar-indian-film-festival-hollywood |title=Farhan to get Hollywood agent |work=The Times of India |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Venice Film Festival]] at the [[ArcLight Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/16/entertainment/et-screening16 |title=Indian and Polish film festivals |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=16 April 2009 |accessdate=12 May 2012 |first=Susan |last=King |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016080114/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/16/entertainment/et-screening16 |archivedate=16 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised the film and felt that "Akhtar, a producer, director and writer making his film debut here as an actor, is talented and handsome enough&amp;nbsp;– and with looks that could translate into any number of ethnicities&amp;nbsp;– to have a huge career ahead of him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/fakir-venice-film-review-93083 |title=The Fakir of Venice&amp;nbsp;– Film Review |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Kirk |last=Honeycutt |date=26 April 2009 |accessdate=14 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529025214/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/fakir-venice-film-review-93083 |archivedate=29 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}

== Outline of story ==
[[File:25 tam back.jpg|thumb| Backside of Tibetan [[Historical money of Tibet|25 tam banknote]], dated 1659 of the Tibetan Era (= 1913 CE). On the right, the four harmonious animals are represented.]]
A popular scene often found as wall paintings in Tibetan religious buildings represents an elephant standing under a fruit tree carrying a monkey, a hare and a bird (usually a partridge, but sometimes a grouse, and in Bhutan a [[hornbill]]) on top of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gruschke|first1=Andreas|title=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: The Qinghai part of Amdo|date=2001|publisher=White Lotus Press|location=Bangkok|isbn=9747534592|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GuKfAAAAMAAJ|series=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: Amdo|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene refers to a legend which tells that four animals were trying to find out who was the oldest. The elephant said that the tree was already fully grown when he was young, the monkey that the tree was small when he was young, the hare that he saw the tree as a sapling when he was young and the bird claimed that he had excreted the seed from which the tree grew. So the bird was recognized by the other animals as the oldest, and the four animals lived together in co-dependence and cooperation, helping each other to enjoy the fruits of the tree. After the story is finished, it is revealed the partridge was the Buddha in a previous life.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j1/j1040.htm|title=The Jataka|volume=I|first=Robert|last=Chalmers|author-link=Robert Chalmers, 1st Baron Chalmers|year=1895|chapter=Tittira Jātaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}} The story was meant as an illustration of cooperation and respect for seniority, and was told by the Buddha after some of his students had failed to pay due respect to the senior disciple [[Śāriputra]].&lt;ref name="Whitecross 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=Whitecross,|title="Virtuous Beings": The Concept of ''tha damtshig'' and Being a Moral Person in Contemporary Bhutanese Society|journal=Himalaya, the Journal of the Association for Nepal and Himalayan Studies|date=1 January 2010|volume=28|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/himalaya/vol28/iss1/6/|language=en|issn=2471-3716|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malalasekera 1938"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Tittira Jātaka (No.37)|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names|author-link=G P Malalasekera|first=G.P.|last=Malalasekera|volume=2|url=http://palikanon.com/english/pali_names/t/tittira_j_37_117_319_438.htm|year=1938|publisher=[[Pali Text Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the tale also describes the animals upholding the [[five precepts]] and teaching them to others.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005" /&gt; One of the oldest extant forms of the story is the [[Pali]] version, called the ''Tittira Jataka''.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

Communal harmony and respect for seniority are the main moral of the story. Such respect stands in contrast with a [[pecking-order]] according to strength, size and power: it is {{em|the partridge}} which is most respected, not the elephant.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Penjore|first1=Ugyen|title=Understanding the symbolism of Thuenpa Puen Zhi|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=40,1531,0,0,1,0#.WI0s0FUrK70|via=The Buddhist Channel|accessdate=28 January 2017|work=Kuensel Online|date=2 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Buddha did sometimes downplay the value respecting older people merely for their age, in this story he illustrates that a senior person should nonetheless be respected for their experience, because, as Tachibana points out, "the maturity of age is generally the sign of much experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tachibana|first1=S.|title=The ethics of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BRWyqi2K4WUC|date=1992|publisher=[[Curzon Press]]|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=978-0-7007-0230-5|page=224|edition=Facsim.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story led to the establishment of several rules of conduct with regard to respect for seniority in the context of the monastic life, in which the {{em|number of years ordained}} as a [[Bhikkhu|monk]] (''{{lang-sa|bhikṣu}}''; ''{{lang-pi|bhikkhu}}'') is measured, rather than {{em|age}}.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Sarah|title=The Jatakas: Birth Stories of the Bodhisatta|date=2006|publisher=[[Penguin UK]]|isbn=9788184750348|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ay4WFGQtSy0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] explains the relation between respect for seniority and harmony, drawing from the story: "A hierarchy based on seniority, however, is both objective and, in the long run, less oppressive: One's place in the hierarchy is not a measure of one's worth.  Such a hierarchy also discourages the pride and competition that would come if bhikkhus could fight their way up the hierarchy by outdoing the measurable merit of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc2.pdf|title=The Buddhist Monastic Code|date=2013|publisher=[[Metta Forest Monastery]]|year=|isbn=|edition=3rd|volume=II|location=California|page=92|pages=|quote=|author-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|via=|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four animals represent the different [[habitats]] of the animal world—the sky, the trees, the ground, and underground.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}} The partridge assumes the role of the most senior animal: in pre-modern India, the partridge was highly regarded for its intelligence and understanding  of language.&lt;ref name="Gutierrez 2014"&gt;{{cite thesis|title=The Parrot’s Voice and the Partridge’s Feathers: The Languaging of Animals and Animal Language in Early Indian Texts|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/28521|first=Andrea Lorene|last=Gutiérrez|publisher=[[The University of Texas]]|type=M.A. Thesis|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excreting of the seed of the tree is relevant, because some Indian trees are believed to only sprout when the seed is excreted by a bird, thus further amplifying the concept of cooperation and mutual dependence.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|53}} The image of the animals standing on each other’s shoulders, on the back of a patient elephant, also portrays social and environmental harmony: the bird finds a seed and plants it, then the rabbit waters it, and the monkey fertilizes it. Once the seed sprouts and begins to grow, the elephant protects it. After some time, the small plant grows into a big, beautiful tree full of healthy fruit. By working together and using their individual talents, the four friends are able to reach and enjoy the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/resources/pdf/Signs/Bhutan/BH_PRG_03.pdf|title=The Four Harmonious Friends|last=|first=|date=12 June 2008|website=[[Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary source for the Buddhist legend of the four harmonious brothers is the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka|Vinayavastu]]'' ({{bo|w='dul ba'i gzhi}}), which forms the first section of the [[Kangyur]], the canon of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Dagyab 2016" /&gt;{{rp|107}}&lt;ref name="sagaster" /&gt; In canons of other Buddhist traditions, such as in the [[Pali Canon]] of [[Theravāda]] Buddhism, and in the texts of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]], [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūla-Sarvāstivāda]] and [[Sarvāstivāda]] orders, almost the same ''Jātaka'' tale is found in the ''Vinaya'' and ''Jātaka'' collections. The [[Dharmaguptaka]] and [[Mahīśāsaka]] orders did not consider the story part of the ''Jātaka'', however, and only included it in their ''Vinayas''. [[Bhikkhu Analayo]] believes that originally the story was not considered a previous life of the Buddha, but only a [[didactic]] [[parable]] taught by the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Analayo 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anālayo|first1=Bhikkhu|author-link=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Canonical Jātaka Tales in Comparative Perspective: The Evolution of Tales of the Buddha's Past Lives|journal=Fuyan Buddhist Studies|date=2012|volume=7|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/38470683/CanonicalJatakas.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1485644573&amp;Signature=et7fWx%2FMyFxtAwEa%2BgTKug1ISow%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCanonical_Jataka_Tales_in_Comparative_Pe.pdf|publisher=Fuyan Buddhist Institute|location=[[Hsinchu]]|issn=2070-0512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Irish]] scholar [[Eleanor Hull]] has pointed out that the story may reveal a custom of the ancient world to determine the date based on the life spans of different animals. Stories dealing with the question which animal lives the longest are found throughout the world. Asiatic versions of the story usually feature three animals, as indeed, the Pali and Chinese versions of the ''Jātaka'' do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hull|first1=Eleanor|author-link=Eleanor Hull|title=The Hawk of Achill or the Legend of the Oldest Animals|journal=Folklore|date=December 1932|volume=43|issue=4|pages=377, 383|doi=10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ralston|first1=W.R.S.|title=The Bible of Tibet: Tibetan Tales from Indian Sources|date=2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-136-20297-1|page=302|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eoiZAeFA_8YC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the fourth animal not present in the Pali version, the hare—it was included in later versions.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimball|first1=Mike|title=Our heritage is already broken: meditations on a regenerative conservation for cultural and natural heritage|journal=Human Ecology Review|date=2016|page=13|doi=10.4225/13/581fcdf8dc329|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1885/100985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2142">Baron '''François du Four''' ([[Turnhout]], [[Belgium]], 1871 – 1945) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] industrialist. He married Germaine Herry in 1902, and together they had seven daughters and a son.

When his mother, Josephina Frederika Dessauer, died in 1904, he became the owner of the family business [[Brepols]], a paper - and playing card factory. The company at that moment had about 1000 employees. From 1919 up to 1932 François du Four was mayor of Turnhout. In 1929, King [[Albert I of Belgium]] knighted him and granted him the title of [[baron]]. The heraldic motto of the du Fours is ''Melius esse quam vider'', which means ''it is better to be than to seem'', and their own weapon-shield represents a lion.

In Turnhout there is a street named after him: the baron François du Four street, which starts on the central market place of Turnhout. In this street the old factory buildings of Brepols were located. In 1945, Francois du Four died at the age of 74.

François du Four liked racing-horses. His [[thoroughbred]]s won a lot of races and a lot of price money. After he died, regretfully, all his horses were sold. In 1904, he had bought a small farm in [[Retie]] with neighboring pasture. He was especially looking for a place where he could breed thoroughbreds. In 1905, he started with the construction of the park where now the castle of Retie stands. In 1906, he started the building of a castle and the stables for his horses.

Mancinelli was born to a noble family.{{sfn|Coulton|1950|p=750}} He joined the [[Jesuits]] in 1558{{sfn|Coulton|1950|p=750}} and in 1566 was a [[Novitiate|novice]] in the first novitiate house in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Month|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bv4jAQAAIAAJ|year=1941|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Missionary appointments ==
Mancinelli was a missionary in [[Bosnia]] and [[Dalmatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deresiński  |first=Wojciech  |last2= |first2= |date=2010 |title=Mancinelli |url=http://www.duchprawdy.com/ |journal=Mancinelli informator |publisher= Mancienlli Society |volume= 5 |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mancinellus was the head of a Jesuit mission to [[Istanbul]] established by the Pope in 1583.{{Sfn|Frazee|2006|p=74}} They held their services in the [[Church of Saint Benoit, Istanbul|Church of Saint Benoit]] and opened their schools with the support of French and Venetian ambassadors.&lt;ref name="DarnaultBirkan2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darnault|first1=Sezim Sezer|last2=Birkan|first2=Çelen|title=Latin Catholic Buildings in Istanbul: A Historical Perspective, 1839-1923|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edXVAAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Isis|isbn=978-975-428-275-7|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period between 1585 and 1587 Mancinelli traveled from Constantinople through [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldova]], visited Lvov (then in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], now in [[Ukraine]], and later [[Kraków]], [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Having journeyed as far as [[Russia]], he then returned to [[Italy]] via [[Vienna]], where he spent a few months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giulio-mancinelli_(Dizionario-Biografico)/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1592 he was sent to Algiers, in response to a request made to the Jesuits by the government of Naples, in order to redeem the Christian slaves:  he wrote a memorial of this journey in ''Morea'' (Rome, Archivum Romanum Societatis Iesu, ''Vitae'', 46 , cf. 68-83) and in" Observations about redeeming Christian slaves from Servitude to Unbelievers" (ibid., ''Vitae'', 51, cc. 43r-45r). He experienced a supernatural ecstasy during the trip---saints and angels appeared to him to reassure him about the positive outcome of the mission to [[Moldova]]---and he recorded his observations.&lt;ref name="PozsonyCsermely2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pozsony|first1=Ferenc|last2=Csermely|first2=Peter|title=The Hungarian Csángó of Moldova|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I9toAAAAMAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Corvinus Publishing|isbn=978-1-882785-18-6|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1608, he was on mission in England and according to his own testimonies had visions of [[angel]]s.&lt;ref name="Marystone1963"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marystone|first=Cyril|title=The Coming Type of the End of the World and the Universal Conversion of the Nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gz4sAAAAIAAJ|year=1963|publisher=o.V.|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his old age he was regularly consulted by young men who traveled to England hoping to bring it back to union with Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Month|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bv4jAQAAIAAJ|year=1941|page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS --&gt;
After his father's recent death, Zach Cooper ([[Dylan Minnette]]) and his mother Gale ([[Amy Ryan]]) move from [[New York City]] to the peaceful town of Madison, [[Delaware]]. While settling in the new neighborhood, Zach befriends his neighbor Hannah ([[Odeya Rush]]) until her overprotective father ([[Jack Black]]) warns him to avoid contact with them. The next morning, at Madison High School, where Gale works as vice-principal, Zach befriends Champ ([[Ryan Lee (actor)|Ryan Lee]]), a shy and clumsy student. That night, Hannah invites Zach to an abandoned [[amusement park]] but when they return home, Hannah's father warns again that Zach stays away or something bad will happen.

The following night, Zach listens as Hannah and her father argue. Followed by screams and crashings objects, he calls the police. Hannah's father assures officers that the noises comes from his television. Shortly after, Gale leaves to supervise a [[spring break]] dance at school, leaving Zach with his aunt Lorraine ([[Jillian Bell]]). Fearing that Hannah is in danger, Zach tricks her father into going to the police station while he enters his home with Champ's help. While investigating, they both find a bookshelf with numerous books from the [[Goosebumps|''Goosebumps'' franchise]], each mysteriously locked. In response to Champ's curiosity, Zach opens ''[[The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena]]'', releasing the real [[Yeti|Abominable Snowman]]. With Hannah's help, they chase the monster to a local [[ice rink]] where Hannah's father appears and encloses the creature again in the book.

Back home, Hannah's father unwittingly reveals that he is ''Goosebumps''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' author, [[R. L. Stine]]. When they arrive, the group meets [[Slappy the Dummy]], the evil [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist dummy]] from ''[[Goosebumps (original series)|Night of the Living Dummy]]''. As revenge for being locked up for years, Slappy burns his own book and flees with all the other ''Goosebumps'' books in the Haunted Car from [[The Haunted Car|the book of the same name]], after having released him. Stine and the kids are attacked by living [[Garden gnome|lawn gnomes]] from ''[[Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes]]'', being forced to escape. Meanwhile, Slappy rampages through Madison, releasing several monsters, causing panic  and destruction around the town: [[mutant]] [[plant]]s from ''[[Stay Out of the Basement]]'' destroy the cell towers; a [[vampire]] [[poodle]] from ''[[Please Don't Feed the Vampire!]]'' attacks Lorraine; and the Body Squeezers from ''[[Invasion of the Body Squeezers]]'' freeze the officers at the police station.

Zach implores Stine to write a new book that can lock all the monsters back, but it can only be done with a supernatural [[typewriter]] displayed at school. Along the way, the group is attacked by Brent Green from ''[[My Best Friend Is Invisible|My Best Friend is Invisible]]'' and the giant [[Mantis|praying mantis]] from ''[[A Shocker on Shock Street]]'', so they hide in a supermarket. Will Blake, the [[werewolf]] from ''[[The Werewolf of Fever Swamp]]'' chases them to the parking lot where he is run over by Lorraine, who survived the attack. However, she is frozen by the Body Squeezers when she enters the police station to ask for help.

Stine and the kids go through a [[cemetery]], where Zach realizes that Hannah shines in the moonlight before being attacked by [[ghoul]]s from ''[[Attack of the Graveyard Ghouls]]''. When they arrive at school, Zach confronts Stine in private; he reveals that his daughter is Hannah Fairchild from ''[[The Ghost Next Door]]'', creating her to face his loneliness, although she isn't aware that she isn't real. Stine finds the typewriter and begins writing a book based on the events of the film while Slappy burns all the books, releasing every monster, demon and creature spotted in the ''Goosebumps'' franchise on the school's soccer field. Zach and Champ try to warn the students, but nobody believes them until the monsters begin to break into the building. Bees from ''[[Why I'm Afraid of Bees]]'' attack Zach in the library while the rest of the monsters manage to enter the school with the help of the Annihilator 3000 from ''[[Toy Terror: Batteries Included]]''. Champ saves Taylor from the werewolf and become love interests. Slappy finds Stine and breaks his fingers with the typewriter before he can finish the book.

While the students and school staff continue to defend themselves from the monsters' attack, Stine and the kids board a school bus to the abandoned amusement park. Slappy discovers them and releases the Blob from ''[[The Blob That Ate Everyone]]'' as the monsters arrive at the park. Stine confronts the creature and is devoured while Zach, Hannah and Champ climb a [[Ferris wheel]] to finish the book. However, the monsters collapse the Ferris wheel, causing it to roll towards the forest. Zach refuses to open the book because Hannah will also be locked up, but she reveals that she knew the truth about herself all this time. Hannah opens the book, sucking Slappy and all the ''Goosebumps'' monsters inside, saying goodbye to Zach with a kiss before being sucked in.

Some time later, Stine starts working as the new English teacher at the school while starting to date Lorraine. After school, Stine reveals to Zach that he re-wrote Hannah back into reality with a new book. She and Zach kiss and leave school together while Stine burns Hannah's book, making her permanently real. When Stine is about to leave school, he looks at the typewriter writing by itself. To his horror, Brent Green has escaped his imprisonment, beginning to write a new ''Goosebumps'' book entitled ''The Invisible Boy's Revenge''.

==Production==
===Development===
The first attempt at a ''Goosebumps'' film, in 1998, was set to be produced by [[Tim Burton]]. [[Chris Meledandri]], the president of Fox Family Films at the time, said, "I think you'll see us tackling a scale of story that would be prohibitive to do on the small screen".&lt;ref name="Weekly"&gt;{{cite web |last=Flamm |first=Matthew |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,281459,00.html |title=Between The Lines |date=January 9, 1998 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film did not materialize since they could not find a script they liked or determine which book or monster to adapt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thewrap.com/goosebumps-rl-stine-tim-burton-stephen-king/ | title='Goosebumps' Author R.L.

The duo decided against adapting any one book in the series, feeling the individual books in the series were too short. Thinking of ways to create a universe where all the creatures in the books could live together, they elected to do a fake [[biographical film]] where R. L.

[[File:Goosebumps, Jack Black, Monsters, SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Jack Black]] "fighting" Slappy and his fellow monsters at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].]]
[[File:Goosebumps, Jack Black, Rob Letterman, SDCC 2014-2.jpg|thumb|The film marks the third collaboration between Jack Black and director [[Rob Letterman]], who previously worked together on ''[[Shark Tale]]'' and ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'']]
In September 2013, it was reported that [[Jack Black]] was in talks to "play a Stine-like author whose scary characters literally leap off the page, forcing him to hide from his own creepy creations".&lt;ref name="thewrap"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sneider|first=Jeff|title=Jack Black in Negotiations to Star in 'Goosebumps' Movie for Sony, Scholastic Media (Exclusive)|url=http://www.thewrap.com/jack-black-in-negotiations-to-star-in-goosebumps-movie-for-sony-scholastic-media-exclusive/|accessdate=September 14, 2013|newspaper=The Wrap|date=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black stated that he tried to make the character "more of a sort of curmudgeonly dark, brooding beast master".

The film was promoted at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] where Jack Black and Rob Letterstein interacted with Slappy the Dummy. Slappy even brought some of his "friends" out consisting of the Bog Monster from ''How to Kill a Monster'', two Graveyard Ghouls from ''Attack of the Graveyard Ghouls'', Cronby the Troll and a Mulgani from ''Deep in the Jungle of Doom'', the Lord High Executioner from ''A Night in Terror Tower'', Murder the Clown from ''A Nightmare on Clown Street'', the Mummy of Prince Khor-Ru from ''Return of the Mummy'', Captain Long Ben One-Leg from ''Creep from the Deep'', Professor Shock from ''The Creepy Creations of Professor Shock'', Count Nightwing from ''Vampire Breath'', a Creep from ''Calling All Creeps!'', a Body Squeezer from ''Invasion of the Body Squeezers: Part 1'' and ''Part 2'', Carly Beth Caldwell's Haunted Mask form from ''The Haunted Mask'', a Scarecrow from ''The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight'', and a Pumpkin Head from ''Attack of the Jack-O'-Lanterns''. When Jack Black tells Slappy that it is him that Slappy wants, Slappy instructs the Lord High Executioner, Murder the Clown, and Professor Shock to take Jack Black outside to his car. As the monsters leave, Slappy tells Rob some of his pitches causing Rob to leave as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://comiccon2016.sched.org/event/7hKk/goosebumps|title=Comic-Con 2016: Goosebumps|website=Sched.org|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrEdGjXHqN4|title=Jack Black Goosebumps Panel SDCC 2014|first=|last=thejellybat|date=July 30, 2014|publisher=|access-date=February 7, 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some monsters due for an appearance in the film were cut for budgetary reasons, but Letterman stated that the crew tried to choose the monsters most appropriate to the story.

The site's critical consensus reads, "''Goosebumps'' boasts more than enough of its spooky source material's kid-friendly charm to make up for some slightly scattershot humor and a hurried pace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/goosebumps_2015/ | title=Goosebumps | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 60 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/goosebumps | title=Goosebumps reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/goosebumps-bridge-of-spies-crimson-peak-weekend-box-office-1201585023/ |title='Goosebumps' Raises Hair At The B.O., While 'Crimson Peak's Recedes  |website=Deadline Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin P. Sullivan of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a B rating, citing at the end of his review: "Nothing about ''Goosebumps'' is revolutionary—at a certain point you may realize that it's as if [[Nickelodeon]] produced ''[[The Cabin in the Woods|Cabin in the Woods]]''—but it's a never-boring trip to a world, where stories and imagination are powerful tools, that just might inspire kids to do the scariest thing of all: pick up a book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/09/goosebumps-ew-review | title='Goosebumps': EW review | work=Kevin P.

==Sequel==
{{ main |Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween}}
On September 2, 2015, it was reported that a [[sequel]] was in the planning stages, with Sony looking for a screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Goosebumps-2-Happening-Get-Details-80667.html | title=Goosebumps 2 Is Happening, Get The Details | publisher=Cinema Blend | date=September 2, 2015 | access-date=September 3, 2015 | author=McKnight, Brent}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 17, 2017, a January 26, 2018, release date was set and [[Rob Letterman]] confirmed that he is to return as director for the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evry|first1=Max|title=Goosebumps 2 Release Date Set By Sony Pictures|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/804137-goosebumps-2-release-date-set-by-sony-pictures|publisher=ComingSoon.net|access-date=January 18, 2017|date=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 6, 2017, it was announced that the film's release date has been delayed to September 21, 2018, taking the place of the release date previously held by ''[[Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/811563-sony-pictures-2018-schedule#/slide/1|title=Sony Pictures 2018 Schedule Shifts Hotel Transylvania, Bad Boys, Goosebumps and More|date=February 6, 2017|access-date=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, the title was revealed to be ''Goosebumps: Horror Land''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/849929-goosebumps-2-title-revealed-plus-promo-art-for-jumanji-grinch-and-more#/slide/2|title=Goosebumps 2 Title Revealed, Plus Promo Art for More!|date=2017-05-18|work=ComingSoon.net|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was confirmed that Jack Black will reprise his role as R.L.

'''Guy Martin''' (born 4 November 1981) is a British [[lorry]]-mechanic better known publicly as a [[motorcycle racing|motorcycle]] racer turned television presenter of engineering-based projects, being likened to the late [[Fred Dibnah]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/features/guy-martin-hes-most-comfortable-fixing-lorries-but-tv-has-propelled-the-charming-road-racer-to-fame-and-fortune-31452475.html  	Guy Martin: He's most comfortable fixing lorries but TV has propelled the charming road racer to fame and fortune] ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'', 15 August 2015. Retrieved 4 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin started racing in 1998, debuting on [[road racing|road circuits]] at the [[Isle of Man TT]] events in 2004,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.driving.co.uk/news/guy-martin-on-his-volvo-fastest-car-in-britain/|title=Guy Martin on his Volvo: the fastest car in Britain|website=Sunday Times Driving|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he gained 17 podium finishes.&lt;ref name="Race results"&gt;[https://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/Events/Races.aspx?meet_code=ALL&amp;ride_id=8430 Race results: Guy Martin] IoM tt.com official website.

Following the Ulster Grand Prix accident, Martin stated that he had retired from motorcycle racing although he never disclosed the decision publicly.&lt;ref name="bennetts.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/racing/isle-of-man-tt/news/guy-martin-i-should-have-quit-the-tt-four-years-ago?cid=sm_000001|title="I never said this publicly but I had finished racing"|first=Michael|last=Mann|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However following numerous approaches by Honda Racing team manager Neil Tuxworth,&lt;ref name="bennetts.co.uk"/&gt; Martin confirmed in January 2017 that he had signed for Lincolnshire-based Honda Racing as partner to 23-times TT winner [[John McGuinness (motorcycle racer)|John McGuinness]] for the [[North West 200]], [[Isle of Man TT]] and [[Southern 100]] races.&lt;ref name="itv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/granada/2017-01-18/honda-confirms-guy-martin-and-john-mcguiness-for-iom-tt-2017/|title=Honda confirms Guy Martin and John McGuinness for IoM TT 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motorcyclenews.com/sport/tt-road-races/2017/january/roads-guy-martin-in-shock-tt-return-with-honda-racing/|title=Roads: Guy Martin in shock TT return with Honda Racing|newspaper=Motorcycle News|language=en|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a disappointing campaign with the then-new version of the [[Honda CBR1000RR#2017 redesign|Honda Fireblade]]. After crashing heavily with gearbox trouble in the Superbike TT race, Martin gained a second-place finish in the [[TT Zero#2017 TT Zero Race|TT Zero]] race for electrically-powered machines on the (Honda) [[Mugen Motorsports#Mugen|Mugen]].

[[Motorcycle News]] announced his retirement from motorcycle road racing on 26 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcyclenews.com/sport/tt-road-races/2017/july/roads-guy-martin-calls-time-on-road-racing/|title=Exclusive: Guy Martin calls time on road racing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin immediately refuted this in a statement on his official website " ...I've not given up on racing or road racing, there's no unfinished business and I want to race classics and oddball stuff."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://guymartinracing.co.uk/a-word-from-guy/|title=A word from Guy - Guy Martin Racing|date=2017-07-26|work=Guy Martin Racing|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, [[Formula One|Formula 1]] car team [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] announced that Martin would join their [[Pit stop|pit-crew]] for the impending [[Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian GP]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.williamsf1.com/racing/news/guy-martin-to-join-williams-martini-racing-pit-crew-for-the-belgian-gp Guy Martin to join Williams Martini Racing Pit Crew for the Belgian GP] williamsf1.com, 23 August 2017. Retrieved 23 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin starred in ''[[TT3D: Closer to the Edge|Closer to the Edge]]'', a 2011 documentary on TT racing. He has since presented programmes on various engineering topics and the [[Channel 4]] series ''Speed with Guy Martin'' when he set speed records in a variety of human and engine powered vehicles. He has authored three books, and competed in [[mountain bike]] pedal-cycle races.

His first job after leaving school was as a heavy vehicle mechanic, which he retained since, being unwilling to give it up for full-time racing and media.

==Early life==
Martin was born on 4 November 1981 in a suburb of [[Grimsby]], [[Lincolnshire]], England.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/guy-martin-profile-jeremy-clarkson-s-perfect-replacement-on-top-gear-10237190.html|title=Guy Martin profile: Jeremy Clarkson's perfect replacement on Top Gear|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named Guy in tribute to [[Guy Gibson]] of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]].&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorcyclenews.com/news/2014/december/no-one-has-ever-done-100mph-on-the-wall-of-death-so-we-are-going-to-give-it-a-go/|title=No one has ever done 100mph on the wall of death, so we are going to give it a go|website=Motorcycle News|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Ian was a successful privateer motorbike racer who had competed in several [[Isle of Man TT]] events, but he was forced to supplement his income with a job as a lorry mechanic, additionally selling bikes. His mother, Rita Kidals, was of [[Latvia]]n heritage, her father having come to Britain in 1947 as a [[political refugee]]. Soon after Martin's birth, the family moved to a house outside the town, where they remained, having four children in total.

Martin had shown an interest in working on trucks as early as age 12.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/guy-martin-profile-jeremy-clarkson-s-perfect-replacement-on-top-gear-10237190.html|title=Guy Martin profile: Jeremy Clarkson's perfect replacement on Top|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child he was fascinated by engines, and would take apart lawnmowers to try to make them go faster. Although his interest matched his father's trade, he was happy for Guy to do his own thing, and indeed would try to stop him "talking the whole time about engines" during family holidays to [[Butlins]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/10555336/Sideburns-and-spanners-Guy-Martin-interview.html|title=Sideburns and spanners: Guy Martin interview|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin attended [[Kirmington]] Church of England Primary School and [[The Vale Academy]] school, leaving at age 16. He then enrolled in [[North Lindsey College]] on a motor vehicle engineering course, believing at the time that it was appropriate as further education was what everybody did. He quickly realised it was not for him – he was not being paid and was being taught things he either already knew, or thought would never need, and so decided to leave after a month, having secured an apprenticeship as a truck fitter with a [[Volvo]] centre, John Hebb Volvo.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCCrCQAAQBAJ|title=Guy Martin: My Autobiography|last=Martin|first=Guy|date=2015-05-21|publisher=Virgin Books|isbn=9780753555033|pages=52–54|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin and his siblings attended every Isle of Man TT from their births, until their father Ian crashed his [[Yamaha FZ750]] whilst racing at [[Oliver's Mount]], [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] in 1988, when Guy was aged 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=My Autobiography|last=Martin|first=Guy|page=47|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7535-5502-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After recovering from the resulting broken hip, Martin's father did not race again, but worked as a mechanic in classic bike racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=My Autobiography|last=Martin|first=Guy|page=52|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7535-5502-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Racing ===
While completing his apprenticeship as a lorry mechanic, Martin raced motorbikes in his spare time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Martin returned to the Isle of Man at age 16; overhearing lorry driver and amateur racer Baz Kirk discussing his plans to race in the 1997 [[Manx Grand Prix]] with his father, he was offered the chance to assist him as a race mechanic.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Martin decided to take up racing after a crash on public roads at age 18.&lt;ref name="About Guy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/guy-martins-passion-for-life/articles/all/about-guy|title=About Guy|website=Channel 4|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Ireland]] to join Team Racing. In 2004 he moved to the Uel Duncan Racing team, staying with them until 2005. In 2006 Martin raced for Alistair Flanagan's [[Yamaha Motor Company#Motorcycle racing highlights|AIM Yamaha]] race team, replacing [[John McGuinness (motorcycle racer)|John McGuinness]]. In the search for a more competitive team, Martin joined Hydrex Honda for the 2007 season.

The end of 2009 saw Martin leave Hydrex for Northern Ireland-based Wilson Craig Honda, but since November 2010, Martin has raced for [[TAS Racing]] (known as [[Relentless (drink)|Relentless]] [[Suzuki]], then [[Tyco International|Tyco]] Suzuki from 2012 to 2014, and Tyco [[BMW]] from 2015 to present), the team run by the Neill family also based in Northern Ireland, and with a long TT heritage. This switch to what was effectively a factory team meant the end of tuning his own equipment – for TAS he would simply be riding pre-prepared machines.&lt;ref name="mbr.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbr.co.uk/news/trail_news/feature-riding-with-tt-ace-guy-martin-313979|title=Guy Martin: Riding with the Isle of Man TT ace - MBR|website=MBR|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin agreed a new deal for 2015 with TAS after the team agreed a new equipment deal with [[BMW Motorrad]], to ride the [[BMW S1000RR]] alongside [[William Dunlop (motorcycle racer)|William Dunlop]].&lt;ref name="BBC29777669"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/northern-ireland/29777669|title=BBC Sport - TAS team set to link up with BMW for road race season|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin was prepared to retire had TAS not chosen to switch to BMW, believing he had raced the Suzuki as hard as he could.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/motorsport/30536376|title=BBC Sport - Isle of Man TT 2015: Guy Martin 'excited' by BMW TT package|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the new bike, he ran his fastest ever lap of the TT circuit in June 2015 – 132.398&amp;nbsp;mph – just outside the outright lap record.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/motorcycling/end-of-the-road-for-guy-martin-as-he-skips-north-west-200-and-isle-of-man-tt-34380128.html|title=End of the road for Guy Martin as he skips North West 200 and Isle of Man TT - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|website=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin suffered a serious crash in the Dundrod 150 Superbike event, part of the [[Ulster Grand Prix]] races in August 2015.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Following the crash, Martin only got back on his racing motorbike in March 2016, for the filming of the F1 special for his ''Speed'' series.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/03/13/david-coulthard-and-guy-martin-interview-the-boy-racers-who-turn/|title=David Coulthard and Guy Martin, interview: the boy racers who turned down Top Gear|website=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other motorbike events, he has purchased a [[Honda CRF450]] with the intention of racing in the [[Superprestigio Dirt Track|Superprestigio Open]], and he also intends to compete in the [[Paris Dakar Rally]] at some point.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;

Since 2011, he has also got into bicycle racing, in 24-hour events.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/07/guy-martin-bike-racer-isle-of-man-tt-speed-with-guy-martin-channel-4|title='I love racing because it can kill you,' says bike racer Guy Martin|last=Lamont|first=Tom|date=2014-12-07|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2016 season Martin decided not to race in the TT for the first time in 11 years, opting instead for a mountain bike race. He was uncertain if the decision would lead him to retire from road racing, mountain bike racing, or if he would go on to do something else, but said "if I do race on the roads it will be with TAS".&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

Martin signed a new deal with Honda Racing on 18 January 2017 to ride the Honda CBR1000RR Fireblade SP2, rekindling his ambition to win the Isle of Man TT and renewing his focus on his road racing career.&lt;ref name=":182"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.commercialmotor.com/news/guy-martin-signs-new-team-tt|title=Guy Martin signs with new team for TT|website=Commercial Motor|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Television ===
Martin first came to the attention of TV executives in 2009 when he appeared in an ITV4 programme intended primarily for fans of that year's TT race. The then film-producer, Andy Spellman, filmed with Guy at the TT. Spellman shot some additional test material of Martin back at home in the summer and the boss of North One television showed the clips to a BBC executive.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Having engaged Andy Spellman as his advisor and agent in 2009, Martin worked with North One TV Producers James Woodroffe and Ewan Keil, as he has done to present day. Martin's first appearances on TV documentaries were on programmes based around his passion for engineering rather than his love of adrenaline sport, ''The Boat that Guy Built'' airing on the BBC in 2011, and ''How Britain Worked'' on Channel 4 in 2012.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His thrill-seeking side later emerged with the production of the series ''Speed with Guy Martin'', first airing on Channel 4 in 2013.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Uncomfortable with presenting to camera or working from a script, his preferred style is to improvise his dialogue, and work by responding to questions from crew off camera, which are designed both to prompt him, as well as keep him focused, and even stop him "rattling on" if necessary.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;

He later turned down an invitation from [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] to join the new presenting team of the BBC's motoring show, ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He stated "With the programmes I do on Channel 4 I'm wagging my own tail, not having it wagged for me."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Despite enjoying the work, due to the amount of time it was taking to film his ''Speed'' series, time taken away from his maintenance job, Martin considered taking a break from television in 2015. He changed his mind after reaching a deal to film the India and wall of death programmes, and possibly a few more one-off ''Speed'' specials, including an unstated record in Europe.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; His August 2015 crash pushed back the planned date for his Wall of Death show, from 4 October.&lt;ref name=":275"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/british-superbikes/bike-legend-guy-martin-believes-6805877|title=Guy Martin believes if he reaches age 40 he'll 'have done alright'|last=Fox-Leonard|first=Boudicca|website=mirror|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing ===
Martin has written three books about his life, releasing his [[autobiography]], ''Guy Martin: My Autobiography, on'' 8 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHKnAgAAQBAJ|title=Guy Martin: My Autobiography|last=Martin|first=Guy|date=2014-05-08|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780753549957|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached No.1 in the ''Sunday Times'' bestseller list and remained there for at least six weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/People/article1425446.ece|title=Grimsby biker's bestseller puts a spanner in the literati|website=www.thesundaytimes.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually became the second best selling autobiography of 2014.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This was followed by ''Guy Martin: When You Dead, You Dead,'' released on 22 October 2015, and covering the previous year in diary format, from the 24-hour Solo World Mountain Bike Championship to the Isle of Man TT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xknJCgAAQBAJ|title=Guy Martin: When You Dead, You Dead|last=Martin|first=Guy|date=2015-10-22|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=9780753556764|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was listed No.1 in online retailer [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s sales figures for celebrity autobiographies in November 2015, with his main autobiography being No.10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/shopping/esbest/bestselling-celebrity-autobiographies-of-2015-revealed-by-amazon-uk-a3133791.html|title=Bestselling celebrity autobiographies of 2015|website=Evening Standard|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; October 2016 saw the release of his latest book, titled "Guy Martin: Worms to Catch" featuring Guy's thoughts on the past year and upcoming challenges.

Martin is also listed as the author of companion books for some of his television shows: ''How Britain Worked,'' published on 4 October 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMHaKbWZ7TsC|title=How Britain Worked|last=Martin|first=Guy|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=9780753540848|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Speed'', published on 1 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bm7ClQEACAAJ|title=Speed: How to Make Things Go Really Fast|last=Martin|first=Guy|date=2013-12-01|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=9780753541067|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Truck maintenance and other work ===
In addition to his television and racing activities, Martin has continued to work as a truck fitter. He currently works for Moody International, a Scania centre in [[Grimsby]], working Monday to Fridays, while also regularly working overtime shifts on Saturdays.&lt;ref name="driving.co.uk" /&gt; He only takes short periods off to race or do television work, and on his return ensures he starts early to make up for the time lost.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He also earns money by tuning fellow racer's bikes in the evenings.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbr.co.uk/news/trail_news/feature-riding-with-tt-ace-guy-martin-313979|title=Guy Martin: Riding with the Isle of Man TT ace - MBR|website=MBR|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also takes casual work during TT race weeks.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; Eager to keep his options open, he has even bought a tractor, using it on biomass farms for seasonal muck-spreading at night.&lt;ref name=":275"/&gt;

On his apprenticeship, he earned £300 a week working a 60-hour week plus 10 hours' overtime on Saturdays, while also attending classroom-based training at college on a day release basis. He also supplemented his income working for his father, who at the time was self-employed, running a truck maintenance business.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; As well as his truck job, in his early career he also financed his racing with evening shifts at Chicago Rock Café and weekend work at [[Port of Grimsby|Grimbsy docks]].&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt; After his apprenticeship, Martin then worked for his father at the local [[Scania AB|Scania]] garage.

Due to the filming commitments for ''The Boat that Guy Built'', he ended up losing his job working for his father, but immediately went into town to apply for another truck job.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9614490/How-Britain-Worked-Channel-4-Preview.html|title=How Britain Worked, Channel 4, Preview|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 it was confirmed that Martin was to pilot [[Triumph Motorcycles Ltd|Triumph Motorcycles']] attempt on the [[Motorcycle land-speed record|motorcycle land speed record]] (World's Fastest Motorcycle), at the time standing at 376.363&amp;nbsp;mph (605&amp;nbsp;km/h), set by Rocky Robinson in 2010. The attempt was originally scheduled for August during the [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] event at [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in the United States. Competing in the Division C (streamlined motorcycle) category, the [[Triumph Rocket|Triumph Rocket Streamliner]] is 25.5 feet long, powered by two turbocharged, methanol fuelled, [[Triumph Rocket III]] engines, enclosed in a carbon Kevlar monocoque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-33505344|title=Guy Martin to attempt 400mph land speed record|website=BBC News|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.motorcycle.com/2015/07/09/racing/guy-martin-joins-triumph-in-attempt-to-reclaim-land-speed-record/|title=Guy Martin Joins Triumph in Attempt to Reclaim Land Speed Record - Motorcycle.com News|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary about the attempt was made for Channel 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/guy-martin-and-triumph-attempt-to-bring-the-record-back-home/|title=Guy Martin and Triumph Attempt to Bring the Record Back Home - Channel 4 - Info - Press|website=www.channel4.com|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His August 2015 crash at the Ulster GP caused the attempt to be postponed until September 2016.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/motorcycling/guy-martins-world-record-bid-shelved-until-2016-following-ulster-grand-prix-crash-31451601.html Guy Martin's world record bid shelved until 2016 following Ulster Grand Prix crash] ''Belfast Telegraph'' 14 August 2015, Retrieved 22 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin's quest to set a new two-wheeled world land speed record was called off due to conditions on the course. The attempt, on the purpose-built 400&amp;nbsp;mph motorcycle, suffered a number of setbacks at the track at Bonneville Salt Flats, in Utah, USA.

The streamliner tipped over when it passed over a rut in the track as it was being towed to the start line. Triumph said rain meant it was not possible to create the required-consistency across the 11-mile course necessary to undertake the attempt. On 18 September 2016, Martin had hoped to complete a required 300&amp;nbsp;mph trial run before attempting to set a new world record.

A mile into the run the machine lost traction on the damp surface, veering off the steered path and tipping over on the course. Martin was confirmed to be "completely uninjured" and the record attempt was postponed once more.

== Public perception and critical reception ==
Reviewing ''Closer to the Edge'', his breakthrough appearance,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''The Guardian'' said: "What could have been a pretty dull film just for motorbike fans and devotees of the Isle of Man TT race, achieves real human interest and excitement due partly to a focus on one competitor: likable motormouth Guy Martin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/21/tt3d-closer-to-the-edge|title=TT3D: Closer to the Edge – review|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|date=2011-04-21|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV reviewers before and since have noted his gentle but gritty, spontaneous, direct, earthy and blokey style, his infectious enthusiasm, natural talent, nice turn of phrase, and engaging features.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/nov/11/tv-review-time-team-forgotten-gunners-ww1|title=TV review: The Forgotten Gunners of WW1 – A Time Team Special; How Britain Worked|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|date=2012-11-11|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/03/13/david-coulthard-and-guy-martin-interview-the-boy-racers-who-turn/|title=David Coulthard and Guy Martin, interview: the boy racers who turned down Top Gear|website=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/12050395/Our-Guy-in-Latvia-channel-4-review.html|title=Our Guy in Latvia, Channel 4, review: 'the magic was missing'|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/guy-martin-profile-jeremy-clarkson-s-perfect-replacement-on-top-gear-10237190.html|title=Guy Martin profile: Jeremy Clarkson's perfect replacement on Top|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested he brings something unique to presenting,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24"/&gt; with comparisons being made with the late [[Fred Dibnah]].&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.driving.co.uk/news/guy-martin-on-his-indian-motorbike-adventure/|title=Guy Martin on his Indian motorbike adventure|website=Sunday Times Driving|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing his subsequent work after he turned down the ''Top Gear'' presenting role, critics have lamented what might have been.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/03/17/guy-martin-not-chris-evans-should-have-been-the-new-top-gear-pre/|title=Guy Martin, not Chris Evans, should have been the new Top Gear presenter – review|website=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jasper Rees of ''The Daily Telegraph'', it is his "combination of eccentricity and humility that makes him so popular with viewers".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The wider media have picked up on his views, interests, reluctance to be famous and "simple" lifestyle,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; leading to descriptions of Martin as a "working-class hero".&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Among racing fans, Martin is seen as something of a cult hero&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; Described as the most famous racer never to have won the TT, he is credited with opening up road racing to a diverse global audience in the modern era.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Inside the racing paddock, Martin is seen as somewhat of an outsider or maverick, which he is comfortable with.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; On joining TAS racing in 2011, team manager Philip Neill praised his enthusiasm and free spirit attitude, commenting "He's created a Guy Martin brand without even trying and that's also pretty special," while also observing his commitment to do things their way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iomtt.com/News/2010/11/03/Guy-Martin-joins-TAS-Suzuki-for-2011-Isle-of-Man-TT.aspx|title=Guy Martin joins TAS Suzuki for 2011 Isle of Man TT - Isle of Man TT Official Website|website=www.iomtt.com|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Items owned by Martin were loaned to the [[Grampian Transport Museum]] in [[Alford, Aberdeenshire]] to display as part of their 2016 season. He had previously visited the museum in 2011. It featured his [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]] engine, three of his favourite motorcycles, and the gravity racer used in his ''Speed'' series. The bikes were the one he built for the Pike's Peak episode of ''Speed'', his 2003 Suzuki GSXR 1000 K3 (his most used and most prolific race-winning bike) and the 675 Daytona Triumph used in the 2015 TT Supersport races.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gtm.org.uk/news/guy-martin-collection-to-go-on-show-in-2016/|title=Guy Martin collection to go on display - Grampian Transport Museum|website=www.gtm.org.uk|access-date=2016-04-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331105010/http://www.gtm.org.uk/news/guy-martin-collection-to-go-on-show-in-2016|archivedate=31 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the museum's curator, this was the "first time anywhere that anybody has presented an exhibition of Guy Martin's engineering items".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/aberdeen/854008/first-ever-display-of-guy-martins-machines-at-new-look-north-east-museum/|title=First-ever display of Guy Martin's machines at new-look museum|last=|first=|date=7 March 2016|work=The Press and Journal|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views ==
{{editorial|section|date= June 2016}}

=== Work ethic ===
Martin attributes his strong work ethic to his father's example.&lt;ref name=":275"/&gt; He does not see his racing or TV presenting as real jobs, only hands-on activities.&lt;ref name=":275"/&gt; He has also retained his truck job in part due to the financial security it offered over racing.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; Describing it as "like an ingrained, default setting",&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; he prioritises his mechanic job over other work, even cancelling complicated film shoots at short notice if needed.&lt;ref name=":275"/&gt; He takes more satisfaction in a well done truck job than from any motorbike race.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He also seeks out casual work as a way to switch off during TT events (practice only being in the evenings).&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; Due to his passion for hard work and engineering, had he lived in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times he sees himself as a railway [[Shop foreman|foreman]].&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; He is not fond of spending too much time on the internet,&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; despairing at the distracting effect it has on today's apprentices, who lack interest and commitment.&lt;ref name=":21"/&gt; To work through aches and pains he takes [[cod liver oil]], but suspects it is only working as a [[Placebo|placebo effect]].&lt;ref name=":275"/&gt;

=== Television and fame ===
Martin is not comfortable with being a public figure and rejects any notion that he is a celebrity, turning down offers such as Top Gear's [[Star in a Reasonably Priced Car|Star In A Reasonably Priced Car]] segment.&lt;ref name="driving.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.driving.co.uk/news/guy-martin-on-his-indian-motorbike-adventure/|title=Guy Martin on his Indian motorbike adventure|website=Sunday Times Driving|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After struggling to come to terms with the fame brought about by his media work, Martin was diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/guy-martin-profile-jeremy-clarksons-perfect-replacement-on-top-gear-10237190.html |title=Guy Martin profile: Jeremy Clarkson's perfect replacement on Top Gear |last1=Usborne |first1=Simon |date=8 May 2015 |website=[[independent.co.uk]]|access-date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptical of the psychiatrist's findings, he says "It hasn't changed anything, it just confirms why I do certain things in a certain way."&lt;ref name=":275"/&gt; As a result of his BBC work, he had begun to be recognized by non-racing fans even before the release of the TT3D film.&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt; He would be quite happy if nobody watched his shows, as it would mean he would never get recognized.&lt;ref name=":275"/&gt; While not wanting to seem unappreciative of the public's support, he tries to cope with fame by avoiding crowded situations.&lt;ref name="driving.co.uk" /&gt; He prefers to live out of his van while racing or on television shoots.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

He does not see TV work as a job in itself and would not miss it if it were to end; he views it as a means to do things he otherwise could not,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; gaining invaluable sources of information and experiences from the people it allows him to meet.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; As such, he frequently turns down offers of television work if they don't interest him, and has said his existing TV workload was already becoming an issue.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He fears being seen as inauthentic if he became a full-time presenter, seeing some in the industry as "passionate about anything that they're told to be passionate about".&lt;ref name=":21"/&gt; He has only watched one of his shows, the Pike's Peak episode of Speed, and only on the recommendation of a usually unimpressed friend.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; While appreciating the things his fame has brought him, he's deliberately avoided getting into an unsustainable financial position by living to excess.&lt;ref name=":21"/&gt;

=== Racing and thrill seeking ===
Although following in his father's footsteps into motorcycle racing, Martin is clear that it was his own choice, his father never pressured him into it. His passion for the TT was ignited at age 16 with the invitation from Baz Kirk to return to the island.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Although he has raced in track events, he is attracted to road racing, and the TT in particular, due to their dangerous nature. He hopes to win a TT before the event is banned for health and safety reasons.&lt;ref name="mbr.co.uk"/&gt; He says "I like a bit of danger. I haven't got a death wish but it makes things exciting, doesn't it?".&lt;ref name=":18"/&gt; He likes the appeal of reaching 200&amp;nbsp;mph all the time in road races, and their unforgiving nature, something he believes series like the [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]] or [[Superbike World Championship|Superbikes]] simply don't offer.&lt;ref name="mbr.co.uk"/&gt;

Mindful of the risks, he would not regret dying in a race, but he is prepared to go beyond the line (beyond which you risk crashing), in order to win.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; The danger feeds his need to feel in control of his destiny,&lt;ref name=":21"/&gt; although he conceded the inherent risks mean he would be doing well if he lived to age 60.&lt;ref name=":275"/&gt; His major crashes of 2010 and 2015 have not changed his outlook;&lt;ref name=":18"/&gt; he has described the moment before losing control in 2010 crash as priceless, the ultimate feeling of danger.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10511832/Guy-Martin-why-I-like-to-go-dangerously-fast.html|title=Guy Martin: why I like to go dangerously fast|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wants to go fast and get near death, while also walking away.&lt;ref name="driving.co.uk" /&gt; He denies he is reckless and believes everything he does is calculated;&lt;ref name=":275"/&gt; believing you get out of life what you put in, he ensures he trains and prepares hard for dangerous activities so he is in control of, and can even enjoy, the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Speed with Guy Martin, Pike's Peak episode, Channel 4, 2 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His television producer agrees, stating "he's not stubborn, or reckless, he's calculating".&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; This attraction of the combination of speed and a sense of danger was part of the motivation for him doing his ''Speed'' series.&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt;

He has never wanted to race motorbikes full-time, believing he would get sick of the sight of them,&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; and liking the ability of being able to point to his amateur status to professionals, as both an excuse when he loses and a way to gloat when he wins.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; He decided to prioritise cycling over the TT in 2016 as he felt he was nearing the point where he would be too old to compete properly, and after 11 seasons at the TT he was beginning to find the routine of the motorcycle season monotonous.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; While not seeing it as thrilling as motorbikes,&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; he is attracted by the isolation it offers,&lt;ref name=":21"/&gt; and the equal combination of both a physical and mental challenge,&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; feeding into a new found desire to break himself simply for the sense of achievement.&lt;ref name="driving.co.uk" /&gt;

== Hobbies and interests ==
Martin owns a [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin aero engine]] from a 1942 [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bomber]], which he plans to install in his front room, alongside a [[Scania 4-series|Scania 144 530]] truck engine. He is also hoping to acquire a Daimler 600 engine from a [[Messerschmitt]].&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; He also has a 1915 [[Amanco]] ''Chore Boy'' [[stationary engine]] with original [[ignition magneto|low tension magneto]] in his kitchen.&lt;ref name="About Guy"/&gt;

Martin is not particularly interested in watching television or spending time on the internet – he doesn't own a TV and has a pre-smartphone era mobile phone.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He is a fan of [[BBC Radio 4]], in particular ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' and [[The Afternoon Play (BBC)|''The Afternoon Play'']], listening while working on trucks or out in his van.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt; He is also a fan of the rock band [[The Stone Roses]], but has never seen them live.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

When living at home, his usual evening routine is to make and fix things in his shed until around 11pm.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; On Sunday mornings he prefers to ride his mountain bike.&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt;

Despite having presented a programme on [[Formula One]], Martin's interest in it extends only to the technology – he has no interest in the sport in general, in particular being dissuaded by its politics.&lt;ref name=":18"/&gt;

== Vehicles owned ==
Martin owns a 2013 [[Ford Transit]] van and a unique Volvo Vöx supercar.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.driving.co.uk/news/guy-martin-on-his-volvo-fastest-car-in-britain/|title=Guy Martin on his Volvo: the fastest car in Britain|website=Sunday Times Driving|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The van is for general transport while the Vöx is just for special occasions,&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt; however he does his daily commute to his truck job on his mountain bike.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; He has owned various [[Opel Astra|Vauxhall Astra vans]], until a bad example put him off the type.&lt;ref name="driving.co.uk" /&gt; He now swears by the reliability of the Transit,&lt;ref name=":19"/&gt; driving it around 40,000 miles a year.&lt;ref name="About Guy"/&gt;

He bought the Vöx in 2012 from [[Koenigsegg]] engineer Mattias Vöcks "for the price of a BMW M3", which he considers was a bargain for what it is – based on a 1967 [[Volvo Amazon]], it was upgraded and customised by Vöcks into an E85 biofuel powered 788&amp;nbsp;bhp vehicle, which Martin claims has reached 205&amp;nbsp;mph on a racetrack.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt; The Vöx followed a string of high performance cars Martin bought for special occasions (only ever owning one at a time, and sometimes only owning his van).&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; At age 21 he bought a [[BMW 3 Series (E46)|BMW E46]] M3 CSL,&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt; followed by a [[Porsche 911 GT3|Porsche GT3]] RS at age 24,&lt;ref name="driving.co.uk" /&gt; then a new [[BMW E92]] M3 V8,&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; and lastly before the Vöx, a 2010 [[Aston Martin V12 Vantage]] bought new at age 28.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/aston-martin/v12-vantage/11773/guy-martin-and-his-aston-martin-v12-vantage|title=Guy Martin and his Aston Martin V12 Vantage|website=Evo|access-date=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found all to be a disappointment or unsuitable in one way or another, being particularly unimpressed with the Vantage, which had been his dream car, but which he found ostentatious, ultimately selling it cheaply,&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; although he had not driven it in 2011 due to the insurance cost, as a result of his speeding points.&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt; He now deems supercars by marques such as Aston and Ferrari to be "fake" and for people who "don't know anything about cars".&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

He also owns a large collection of bicycles and motorcycles, including a [[Bimota]] which he stored in his kitchen.&lt;ref name="About Guy"/&gt; In bicycles, he has owned a [[Raleigh Chopper]], then a Raleigh Mustang, Falcon Fattrack, but describes his first proper bike as being a Whyte 46 bought in 2005, followed by an Orange 224, Scott Ransom 10, Alpine 160, finally settling on a Cotic, which has become his workhorse, requiring multiple parts replacements due to the wear and tear of constant use.&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt;

=== Speeding ===
By late 2011 he had accrued 21 penalty points on his standard [[Driving licence in the United Kingdom|UK driving licence]], having been caught speeding several times in his Transit van. He avoided a driving ban when on 18 points, being given another three in lieu of a ban, after the judge showed leniency due to the effect it would have on his livelihood, had he lost it.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"/&gt; After a period of "driving like a saint" he was expecting to have regained a clean record by April 2015.&lt;ref name="driving.co.uk" /&gt;

Following claims made in his 7 April 2015 Sunday Times review of the Aston Martin Vanquish, in which he recounted testing the car on an early morning lap of the TT course, police opened an investigation. Driving almost the full length of the TT course (joining at Quarterbridge garage and finishing at Governor's Bridge), he said he was impressed at how fast it really was, reaching 180&amp;nbsp;mph down Sulby Straight and becoming airborne at Ballacrye corner, resulting in "something like a 22-minute lap".&lt;ref name=":19"/&gt; On 27 May police confirmed that after taking advice from the Attorney General's Chambers, they would be taking no further action, while reminding residents and visitors that "Where there is no upper speed limit, road users must at all times be aware that there is a fine line between what is fast and what is dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-32897791|title=Guy Martin will face no police action over 180mph claim|website=BBC News|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later in a radio interview, Martin repeated the claims, and stated he had not broken the law as he had only reached high speeds on derestricted roads (i.e., those with no upper speed limit).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk/Isle-Man-TT-2015-Guy-Martin-confirms-driving/story-26641818-detail/story.html|title=Isle of Man TT 2015: Guy Martin confirms driving at up to 180mph in Aston Martin supercar but did not break the law|website=Scunthorpe Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108205436/http://www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk/Isle-Man-TT-2015-Guy-Martin-confirms-driving/story-26641818-detail/story.html|archive-date=8 November 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motorcycle racing seasons==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2018}}
{{Overly detailed|date=May 2016|section=yes}}

===Early years===
{{Expand section|date=July 2018}}
A successful debut year on the roads that saw him win the Cock o' the North and [[International Gold Cup]] races at [[Oliver's Mount]], [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] as well as the Irish 750cc Support Championship.

===2006 season===
The International road race meetings had mixed results: the [[North West 200]] never went particularly well, The [[Isle of Man TT]] looked promising but problems soon led to it being another disappointment. At the final international of the year, the [[Ulster Grand Prix]], he took 4 race wins and a 2nd making him the Man of the Meeting.

[[File:Guy Podium.JPG|thumb|right|Guy after winning the 2007 Ulster Grand Prix Supersport race]]

=== 2007 season ===
In the early season Martin took part in British Superbike and Supersport rounds to prepare for the road racing season. The first major international of the year was the [[North West 200]] in which he finished with an eighth, a fourth, two thirds and a second. In the CP Hire Superstock race after a bad start Martin finished third. The [[Isle of Man TT]] was the next major race on the calendar and he got a third, two seconds and a DNF after running out of fuel with fewer than three miles to go until his first pit stop. In the Senior race he just missed out on becoming only the second rider, at the time, to have lapped at more than 130&amp;nbsp;mph, his best lap falling short at 129.816&amp;nbsp;mph. Later video footage showed him run wide on the entry to Windy Corner and it was this mistake that led him to miss out on the magical 130&amp;nbsp;mph lap.

Martin continued to race on the English scene and he regained his Cock o' the North title at the Scarborough circuit before going to Ireland for the Kells Road Races in which he took one race win. This was preparation for the [[Ulster Grand Prix]] and in the first race Martin brought home a fifth position, in race two a win, and in the superbike race, which was shortened due to weather, a second. After this red flag the day's racing was cancelled due to bad weather and that meant for the second year in a row Martin was the Man of the Meeting. The Scarborough Gold Cup meeting ended with him winning all the races on the final day including the Gold Cup and the second 600 race of the day after a good battle with John McGuinness and Ian Lougher who were also both on the same Hondas as Martin.

=== 2008 season ===
As well as contesting a full season in the British Superbike Championship, in 2008 Martin again competed in the three International road races but was denied his first TT win when he broke down whilst comfortably leading the opening Superbike race. He was eleven seconds in the lead when an electrical problem forced him out on the fourth lap. He claimed a podium, third, in the Superstock race but suffered further retirements in the Senior and second Supersport races. In September 2008 it was back to Oliver's Mount for the International Gold Cup. Martin won the feature event and now has won 6 Gold Cups in a row, a new record, and also has the lap record for the 1000cc bikes at Scarborough with a time of 1:45.3.

=== 2009 season ===
In 2009 Martin contested all three Internationals as well as selected British Championship and Irish National races. In a move from previous seasons, Martin moved away from the main Hydrex team, preferring instead to run a smaller, close knit team and after a steady North West 200 meeting, confidence was high going into the TT, his number one event of the year, as he sought to win a race at the 37.73 mile circuit on the Isle of Man.

2009 was expected to be the year he broke the seal, but after claiming two seconds and a third on the Superstock, Superbike and Supersport bikes early in the week Martin's engine gave up after coming onto the pit lane in the 2nd 600 race. More grief was to come when putting the bike into gear at the end of his 2nd pit stop during the Senior race his chain snapped, meaning he ended up with another DNF.

Martin regrouped to claim the Southern 100 Championship on the Billown road course in July, after finishing second on no less than three occasions&amp;nbsp;– 2005, 2006 and 2007&amp;nbsp;– before heading to the third International race of the season, the Ulster Grand Prix. After taking third in the Dundrod 150 Superbike race, Martin repeated the result in the feature UGP Superbike race, held over eight laps, but he ensured he would not be without an International win in 2009 when he won a thrilling second Superbike race, just over a tenth of a second in front of fellow Lincolnshire rider Gary Johnson. He also placed fourth and fifth in the equally close Superstock and Supersport races. At the 2009 Gold Cup at Oliver's Mount, Martin won the Steve Henshaw Gold Cup feature race, becoming the first rider to win seven consecutive meetings.

===2010 season===
[[File:Guy martin tt 2010.jpg|upright|thumbnail|right|Martin at the 2010 Isle of Man TT]]
In 2010 he failed to take a podium at the [[2010 North West 200 Races|North West 200]], with his best result being fourth in the second Superbike race. He went to the [[2010 Isle of Man TT|Isle of Man TT]], looking to achieve his first TT victory. However, the meeting was dominated by [[Ian Hutchinson (motorcycle racer)|Ian Hutchinson]], who took a record-breaking five victories in all the solo races, and Martin suffered serious injuries in a major crash in the final race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iomtt.com/en/News/2010/06/11/History-man-Hutchinson-makes-it-a-clean-sweep-at-the-2010-TT.aspx|title=History man Hutchinson makes it a clean sweep at the 2010 TT|date=2010-06-11|accessdate=2010-06-14|work=[[Isle of Man TT]]|publisher=ACU Events Ltd.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613232511/http://www.iomtt.com/en/News/2010/06/11/History-man-Hutchinson-makes-it-a-clean-sweep-at-the-2010-TT.aspx|archive-date=13 June 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to that crash, during the Superbike race, Martin received a 30-second penalty for exceeding the posted pit lane speed limit of 60&amp;nbsp;km/h by just 0.112&amp;nbsp;km/h. Had he not received the penalty, his overall time would have been 1:46:48.05 and put him in 2nd place, behind [[Ian Hutchinson (motorcycle racer)|Ian Hutchinson]] who finished with a time of 1:46:31.82.

His performance at the TT was criticised by [[1989 Nations motorcycle Grand Prix#500 cc classification|Simon Buckmaster]], whose Performance Technical Racing built the bikes which Martin was running. He accused Martin of not listening to his race advice, arguing "He needs to stop being distracted and lift his professionalism. Instead of being a TV star and courting publicity 24x7, he should be concentrating on racing and what's needed to win. Get his focus and concentration into racing, not promoting his name and money-spinning deals." He also cited disrespectful behavior during the race and bad language and criticism directed toward a member of PTR in a magazine interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crash.net/road+racing/news/160828/1/buckmaster_launches_scathing_attack_on_martin.html|title=Buckmaster launches scathing attack on Martin|work=crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|date=2010-06-21|accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin received considerable public support over both the nature and timing of Buckmaster's comments, coming as Martin was still recovering from the crash, but in a subsequent interview Buckmaster defended what he had said, arguing he was not slating him and stating Martin had no issue with the comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crash.net/road+racing/news/161331/1/buckmaster_tells_fans_to_get_courage_or_shut_up.html|title=Buckmaster tells fans to get courage or shut up|work=crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|date=2010-07-07|accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2010 TT crash ====
In the final race, the [[Senior TT]], Martin was a challenger to stop Hutchinson achieving the clean sweep, but was involved in an incident on the third lap of the race at Ballagarey, having led the race just before the first pit stop.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/8735624.stm|title=Ian Hutchinson clinches five-timer at Isle of Man TT|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=BBC|date=2010-06-11|accessdate=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recollecting the crash in 2012, Martin recounted how he has been pushing too hard going into the corner at 160-170&amp;nbsp;mph, having willingly crossed the line [which if you push beyond you might crash] in order to win. He recalled being thrown from the bike and accepting he was not going to survive the approaching high speed impact with a wall, attributing it to luck that he hit it at the right angle to get away with it.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9614490/How-Britain-Worked-Channel-4-Preview.html|title=How Britain Worked, Channel 4, Preview|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airlifted to Noble's Hospital in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] with chest injuries, he was later diagnosed as suffering bruising to both lungs and minor fractures to his upper spine.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

====2011 Ulster GP====
A superbike race 2 win at the Ulster Grand Prix followed for Martin after his consistent TT. He finished second in the opening superbike race behind Bruce Anstey on the Padgetts racing Honda Fireblade.

===2012 season===
[[File:2013 Isle of Man TT 5.jpg|upright|thumbnail|right|Martin at the 2013 Isle of Man TT]]
Martin made his first 2012 appearance at the [[Cookstown|Cookstown 100]] meeting in preparation for the [[North West 200]] and [[Isle of Man TT]]. Martin brought his race season to a close winning five races at Scarborough's Oliver Mount Gold Cup. He also took part in the [[Ryan Farquhar]] Parade lap on one of Ryan's own KMR Kawasaki's.

====2012 North West 200====
Following on from the Cookstown meeting, Martin was set to campaign in all the main races at the North West 200, as a prelude to working up for the [[Isle of Man TT]]. However, during the [[Super sport (motorcycle)|Supersport]] race he crashed. As a consequence, he was left with a suspected head injury, which resulted in his team manager, Philip Neill, withdrawing Martin from the remainder of the racing programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2wheeltuesday.com/2012/05/guy-martins-north-west-200-crash/ |title=Guy Martin's North West 200 Crash |publisher=2WheelTuesday |date=2012-05-21 |accessdate=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to rumours of a 'bust-up' with the Suzuki Team, and resulted in Martin's team boss, Hector Neill, being interviewed on [[Manx Radio|Manx Radio TT 365]] prior to the TT, during which Neill scotched such rumours as; ''"Media inspired skulduggery. Paddock tittle-tattle and unfounded hear-say"''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.Manxradiott365.com/RadioTT{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} News, Monday, 28 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012 TT====
Martin's start to the 2012 TT Festival saw him competing&amp;nbsp;– in a private capacity&amp;nbsp;– at the Pre-TT Classic races at the [[Billown Circuit]], [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]]. Martin was lucky to escape injury while competing in the superbike race, and was battling for the lead of the race on a Suzuki XR69 with Jamie Coward, when he crashed on the final lap. This again led to reports of tension, as the Pre-TT races do not form any part of the main TT racing programme, and posed a potential injury risk to Martin before the TT had begun in earnest. During the practice week for the 2012 Isle of Man TT, Martin made steady progress – albeit amid rumours of differing opinions with his team's management regarding machinery set-up and the team's choice of [[Pirelli]] tyres.

Martin made a good start to the Superbike TT, and at the end of the first lap he was lying in third place behind [[John McGuinness (motorcycle racer)|John McGuinness]] and [[Cameron Donald]]. He continued to hold station during the following three laps, but a problem during his final pit stop at the end of lap four, resulted in the team being unable to replace his rear tyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/sport/isleofmantt/ |title=Isle of Man TT &amp;#124; ITV Sport |publisher=Itv.com |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of diminishing grip from a fading tyre, Martin was overtaken on corrected time by [[Bruce Anstey]] by the end of lap five, although he did hold on to finish fourth with a time of 1hr.47.20 at an average speed of 126.54&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn.iomtt.com/~/media/Files/2012/Results/020612/Superbike/Superbike%20-%20Lap%20by%20lap%20-%202.6.ashx |title=Isle of Man TT Races Fuelled by Monster Energy: Positions at the end of Lap One |publisher=Iomtt.com |accessdate=2012-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026032605/http://cdn.iomtt.com/~/media/Files/2012/Results/020612/Superbike/Superbike%20-%20Lap%20by%20lap%20-%202.6.ashx |archivedate=26 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by fifth place in the [[Superstock TT|Superstock]] race, a retirement in the first [[Super sport (motorcycle)|Supersport]] race and 8th place in the second Supersport outing.&lt;ref name="iomtt.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtt.com/TT-2012/2012-TT-Results.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614100327/http://www.iomtt.com/TT-2012/2012-TT-Results.aspx|archivedate=14 June 2012|deadurl=yes|title=2012 TT Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumours continued to circulate throughout the week about Martin's differences with his team, perhaps instigated by Martin's lateness of signing a contract at the start of the season, although as practice week went on, it was obvious the rumours regarding Martin's split from his team were untrue. The Senior race was scheduled to take place on its traditional Friday – 8 June. However, following adverse weather, the race was postponed until Saturday, 9 June. As a consequence of continued poor weather, the decision to cancel the Senior TT was taken. This was the first time in the race's 105-year history that the Senior had been cancelled due to weather.

=== 2013 season ===

[[File:Guy Martin TT 2013 02.jpg|thumb|Martin at the [[2013 Isle of Man TT]]]]

====2013 Ulster Grand Prix====

Since first competing in 2004, Martin has notched up 11 wins including a hat trick of victories at the 2013 meeting winning the Supersport 1, UGP Superbike and Superbike categories.

===2015 season===
Martin joined his teammates in early March, 2015, for pre-season testing. This initially took the form of a four-day test programme at Cartagena and following this the squad deployed to the BMW Motorrad test camp at Almeria in Spain for the next three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tycobmw.com/almeria-next-up-after-positive-test-at-cartagena-for-tyco-bmw/|title=Almeria next up after positive test for TYCO BMW at Cartagena|work=tycobmw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015 early season====

Martin opened his 2015 season at the [[Oliver's Mount|Oliver's Mount Circuit]] on Saturday 11 April,&lt;ref name="tycobmw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tycobmw.com/spring-cup-victory-for-martin-tyco-bmw/|title=SPRING CUP VICTORY FOR MARTIN &amp; TYCO BMW|work=tycobmw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which he recorded a maiden victory on his [[BMW S1000RR]] [[Superstock TT|Superstock]] at the Scarborough venue.&lt;ref name="tycobmw.com" /&gt; Finishing fourth the following day in treacherous conditions, Martin went on to lift the main prize of the meeting, the Spring Cup.&lt;ref name="tycobmw.com" /&gt;

Following their success at Scarborough, the Tyco Team headed to the opening event in the Irish Racing Calendar, the [[Cookstown 100]]. Martin continued his fine early season form by winning the opening Royal Hotel Superbike Race, and then sealing a brace of superbike wins at the feature race, the KDM Cookstown 100, again accomplished on [[Superstock TT|Superstock machinery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tycobmw.com/764/|title=COOKSTOWN 100 DOUBLE FOR GUY MARTIN &amp; TYCO BMW|work=tycobmw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015 Northwest 200====

Martin was introduced to his factory [[BMW S1000RR]] [[Superbike]] during a day's testing at [[RAF Kirkistown#Current use|Kirkistown]] on 7 May, in preparation for the team's campaign at the [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] [[North West 200|International North West 200]] for the opening practice session on 12 May. Martin's arrival at the triangle circuit generated the usual media interest, however the attention continued following some controversial comments concerning the circuit by Martin. On return from a practice lap on his Supersport machine, Martin was briefly interviewed by [[BBC Sport#Motorcycling|BBC Sport]] presenter Stephen Watson.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/northern-ireland/32756049|title=BBC Sport - North West 200: Chicanes a pain says frustrated Guy Martin|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Struggling to qualify, Martin said he was "bored" riding the course, citing the number of [[chicanes]] which had been introduced in an effort to improve safety.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt;  As on previous occasions this resulted in Martin's team boss, Hector Neill, again having to rally to his rider's defence.
Interviewed by the [[BBC Sport#Motorcycling|BBC]] and other assorted media Neill downplayed the comments, merely alluding to the fact that Martin was becoming concerned that the course was starting to resemble more a purpose-built racing track as opposed to a pure road circuit.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt; This brought reaction from various commentators and competitors, with [[Philip McCallen]] questioning Martin's commitment to the sport as well as his indiscreet criticism of the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/motor-sport/northwest-200/north-west-200-guy-martin-should-question-himself-not-the-track-says-phillip-mccallen-31223820.html|title=North West 200: Guy Martin should question himself, not the track, says Phillip McCallen|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a further interview with [[BBC Sport#Motorcycling|BBC Sport]], again conducted by Watson and with event director Mervyn Whyte in attendance,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/northern-ireland/32763195|title=BBC Sport - Guy Martin explains his North West 200 chicanery|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin apologized for his comments and whilst he was supportive of the event, describing it as a "''mega event,''" he continued that he was not too stuck on the circuit, and that he simply didn't like chicanes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Watson drew Martin's attention to the fact that the comments by this time had been seen by over 300,000 people on [[Facebook]]. Martin made light of the situation, stating that he was "''caught in the heat of the moment, and simply let rip.''"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; He then questioned why he was generating such attention for his comments, when the main attention should not have been directed towards him but rather directed towards the racing, and to the fact that [[Alastair Seeley]] had qualified on [[pole position]] and had subsequently gone on to win the opening race.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

The 2015 [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] [[North West 200|International North West 200]] was blighted by a series of incidents resulting in races being red flagged.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/northern-ireland/32769194|title=BBC Sport - Seeley matches Dunlop's NW 200 record after two more wins|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin did not make an impression in any of the races, and failed to finish in the top six.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

====2015 TT====
Martin's 2015 [[Isle of Man TT]] provided mixed results. Opening his account with a retirement in the [[Superbike|Superbike Race]], he followed this up by taking a respectable 5th place astride the [[Triumph Daytona 600|Smiths Triumph]] in the opening Supersport TT.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/Events/Races.aspx?meet_code=ALL&amp;ride_id=8430|title=Race Results: Guy Martin, Isle of Man TT official website|work=iomtt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switching back to his [[BMW S1000RR]] [[Superstock TT|Superstock]] machine, Martin came home in 7th place in the [[Superstock TT]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Brought in as a late replacement for the injured [[William Dunlop (motorcycle racer)|William Dunlop]] in the [[TT Zero]] Race, and with negligible practice time, Martin took his electrically powered Victory Racing machine to 4th place in his first participation in the class.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; He then secured his only podium place of the meeting, again on board the [[Triumph Daytona 600|Smiths Triumph Daytona]], when he claimed 3rd place in the second Supersport outing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Martin rounded off his 2015 campaign when he took the factory [[BMW S1000RR]] [[Superbike]] to 4th place in the [[Senior TT]] with an average race speed of 129.602&amp;nbsp;mph, but with a fastest lap average of 132.398&amp;nbsp;mph, a personal best for Martin and just two seconds slower than race winner and outright lap record holder [[John McGuinness (motorcycle racer)|John McGuinness]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtt.com/News/2015/June/16/Guy-Martin-joins-132-club.aspx|title=Guy Martin joins 132mph club|work=iomtt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2015 Southern 100 ====
[[File:Guy Martin &amp; Dan Kneen.jpg|thumb|left|Guy Martin leads Dan Kneen and [[Michael Dunlop]] into Church Bends during the 2015 Diamond Jubilee [[Southern 100]]]]Martin arrived back on the [[Isle of Man]] in July in order to compete in the [[Southern 100|Southern 100 Races]] which were celebrating their [[Diamond Jubilee]]. Poor weather initially hampered the racing programme with the Corlett's Trophies 1000/600cc race red flagged in wet conditions.&lt;ref name="Man Examiner' p.32"&gt;''Isle of Man Examiner'' p.32 July 14–20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The race was re-run two days later, with Dan Kneen taking the lead for the opening two laps. However, Martin edged him out, taking the lead on lap 3 and thereafter dicing for the lead with Kneen and [[Michael Dunlop]].&lt;ref name="Man Examiner' p.32" /&gt; Leading at Stadium Corner on the final circuit, Martin looked favourite to take the honours. However, getting maximum drive out of the final corner, Dunlop snatched victory at the line by 0.087 seconds.&lt;ref name="Man Examiner' p.32" /&gt;

Martin then began to take hold of the meeting. Onboard his [[BMW S1000RR]] Martin took to the grid for the finale to the event, the Southern 100 Solo Championship.&lt;ref name="Man Examiner' p.32" /&gt;
Pushed hard during the 9 lap race by Dan Kneen, Martin led the pack by the end of the opening lap and continued to hold station at the end of lap 2. Lap 3 saw Martin maintain his lead, however [[Michael Dunlop|Dunlop]] low sided at [[Ballabeg|Ballabeg Hairpin]] putting him out of the race.&lt;ref name="Man Examiner' p.32" /&gt; The ensuing melee enabled Martin and Kneen to break free from the chasing pack and their two-way battle ensued into the following lap.&lt;ref name="Man Examiner' p.32" /&gt; As the race went into the final two laps, the rear echelon of the field started to have an effect on the front running riders, with Kneen being held up in an overtaking manoeuvre at [[Billown Circuit|Iron Gate]].&lt;ref name="Man Examiner' p.32" /&gt; This enabled Martin to stay clear on the final circuit taking the Southern 100 title for the third year in succession.&lt;ref name="Man Examiner' p.32" /&gt;
[[File:Guy Martin at Church Bends.jpg|thumb|right|Martin at Church Bends during the 2015 [[Southern 100]].]]
Following his victory, Guy Martin joined the late [[Joey Dunlop]] as the only riders to have won the Southern 100 Solo Championship Race for three years in succession.

==== 2015 Ulster GP crash ====
Martin crashed at high speed when leading the 2015 Dundrod 150 Superbike race (part of the Ulster GP) in August. On the final lap, being pursued by [[Bruce Anstey]], he left the course at Ireland's Corner, fracturing thoracic vertebrae, his sternum and a number of ribs and his throttle hand, requiring steel rods to be inserted into his back and a pin in his hand. He signed himself out of hospital four days later.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Having no memory of the incident, being shown footage of the crash for the first time (as depicted on ''Guy Martin's Wall of Death: Live)'' confirmed his suspicion that he had been pushing hard for a perfect corner, due to the pressure from Anstey. He stated that while he had accidents that looked worse, this was the one that caused the most damage. The programme also detailed his recovery period at home, revealing his ice bath treatments in an outdoor pool to relieve the pain, which was affecting his sleep.

===2016 season===
In January 2016 Martin confirmed he would not be racing the 2016 Isle of Man TT as it clashed with a mountain bike race he wanted to compete in, and he would also not be racing the prior North West 200 due to the mountain bike training.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

It was hoped that Martin would be participating at the [[Southern 100]] motorcycle races, defending his solo title and increasing the event's profile. However following his participation in the [[Tour Divide]] it was subsequently announced that Martin would not be competing at the Southern 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyfm.net/cms/news_story_436595.html|title=Guy Martin pulls out of Southern 100|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 season===
It was uncertain whether Martin would retire from racing or return for the 2017 season, but it was announced on 18 January that he had signed for the Honda Racing, based in [[Louth, Lincolnshire]], and would compete alongside teammate [[John McGuinness (motorcycle racer)|John McGuinness]] at various national and international meetings including the [[North West 200]] and [[Isle of Man TT Races]].&lt;ref name="itv.com"/&gt;

In addition, it was confirmed on 20 March that Martin would compete at the 2017 [[Tandragee#Sport|Tandragee 100]] and the [[Cookstown 100]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/northern-ireland/39326947|title=Guy Martin to return to Cookstown 100 and Tandragee 100 road races in April|date=20 March 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tandragee 100====
Martin's first competitive appearance since 2015 was his debut for Honda at the [[Tandragee#Sport|Tandragee 100]] on 22 April, riding the new [[Honda CBR1000RR#2017 redesign|Honda Fireblade]] [[European Superstock 1000 Championship#Regulations|Superstock-class]] machine. During the first lap of the Open [[Superbike]] race, Martin was involved in a collision with another rider at Marlacoo corner. Both were unhurt, but retired from the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/northern-ireland/39679491|title=Guy Martin escapes injury as he crashes out of opening race at Tandragee 100|date=22 April 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/utv/2017-04-22/guy-martin-crashes-out-of-tandragee-comeback-race/|title=Guy Martin crashes out of Tandragee comeback race|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to an incident involving an Italian rider and poor weather conditions, the rest of the meeting was cancelled.

====Spring Cup====
After the Tandragee races, Martin travelled overnight to make the start at [[Oliver's Mount]] for the annual Spring Cup races. Although he had been successful previously at the Scarborough circuit, this low key appearance was more about gaining race-time on the new Honda.

====Cookstown 100====
Martin's next outing of the season was on the [[European Superstock 1000 Championship#Regulations|Superstock]] Fireblade SP2 at the [[Cookstown|Cookstown 100]], additionally riding for the Wilson Craig Team in the [[Sport bike#Classes|Supersport]] class.&lt;ref name="newsletter.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/sport/motorcycling/cookstown-100-william-dunlop-edges-supersport-thriller-1-7939162|title=Cookstown 100: William Dunlop edges Supersport thriller|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After practice, Martin was qualified fifth fastest in the [[Sport bike#Classes|Supersport]], but failed to start in the race. Martin took the big Honda to fifth place in the first [[Superbike|Superbike Race]], however he again failed to start in the second race.&lt;ref name="newsletter.co.uk"/&gt;

====North West 200====
As at the Cookstown 100, it was confirmed Martin would ride for both the factory-supported Honda team, and in the Supersport 600&amp;nbsp;cc class for the Wilson Craig Team. Interviewed by [[BBC Sport#Motorcycling|''BBC Sport'']] ,&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/northern-ireland/39505596|title=North West 200 practice|date=2 May 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin was in upbeat mood, saying he hadn't pushed the machine too hard, and was quite happy with a "steady ride round." Martin's criticism of the course in regard to the chicanes was mentioned.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk1"/&gt; When queried on a previous statement made after the 2015 meeting that he would not return to the triangle circuit, Martin commented that the primary reason was to get the necessary race-time to enter the [[Isle of Man TT Races]]. He also confirmed that he enjoyed riding at the Northwest 200 and that he had development work to do with the new Honda.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk1"/&gt; When queried why he did not renew his association with the Irish Tyco BMW Team, Martin stated that after the 2015 accident, he had decided to retire from racing but still had respect for Tyco BMW, concluding during  the [[Tour Divide]] cycle race that he no longer had passion for  racing.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk1"/&gt; A reason Martin gave for signing for Honda, was that he could fulfill an ambition, as Honda had promised him he could race a vintage [[Honda RC181]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk1"/&gt;

Practice produced mixed results for Martin. Following an accident in practice injuring teammate [[John McGuinness (motorcycle racer)|John McGuinness]] at Primrose Hill on 11 May, a decision was made by Honda Racing to withdraw Martin from that evening's Superstock race. Honda Racing, after further appraisal of the incident involving McGuinness, also withdrew from the remaining events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcyclenews.com/sport/tt-road-races/2017/may/tt-honda-in-crisis-after-mcguinness-crash/|title=TT: Honda in crisis after McGuinness crash|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Wilson Craig Honda 600 Martin qualified 16th fastest during first practice for the Supersport race, recording a fastest lap of 109.614&amp;nbsp;mph,&lt;ref name="northwest200.org"&gt;http://www.northwest200.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/northwest2017_secondsupersport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; slipping to 27th fastest in the second qualifying period,&lt;ref name="northwest200.org"/&gt; which led to Martin starting the race from the ninth row on the grid, bringing his machine home in 23rd place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northwest200.org/2017-results/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Isle of Man TT====
Following the North West 200 incident involving John McGuinness riding the new [[Honda CBR1000RR|Honda SP2]], tests were carried out by the Honda Racing Team prior to the bike arriving at the TT races. The 2017 Isle of Man TT qualifying week was disrupted by poor weather and Martin had little track time. The weather improved towards the end of the week, enabling a full practice session to take place on Friday 2 June. Due to of the lack of practice, the first race day was postponed with the time allotted to additional practice. On 3 June, in ideal conditions, Martin completed four practice laps recording the 26th fastest time, around the road course of {{convert|37.73|mi|km}} in a time of 18 minutes 11.69 seconds at an average speed of {{convert|124.403|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

The opening race, the Superbike TT, was rescheduled for Sunday 4 June  but Martin only got 8 miles into the race before he crashed at [[Doran's Bend]].&lt;ref name="bikesportnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bikesportnews.com/news/news-detail/tt-2017-bruised-wrist-for-martin-after-superbike-crash|title=TT 2017: Bruised wrist for Martin after Superbike crash|first=Road racing|last=desk|website=Bikesport News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview afterwards, Martin stated that as he attempted to change down the gearbox after [[Ballig|Ballig Bridge]] in order to negotiate the 4th gear left handed [[Doran's Bend]], he hit a ''false neutral''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcyclenews.com/sport/tt-road-races/2017/june/tt-2017-tough-start-for-honda-and-guy-martin/|title=TT 2017: Tough start for Honda and Guy Martin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin was unable to offer an opinion as to whether the bike would be safe to ride in the [[Senior TT]], merely describing the [[Honda CBR1000RR|SP2]] as a ''"[[Jonah]]"''.{{clarify|date=November 2017}} Despite crashing at around {{convert|135|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, Martin only sustained a bruised wrist.&lt;ref name="bikesportnews.com"/&gt; 
Following his spill in the opening race, Martin also failed to start in both the Supersport race and the Superstock event.

====Southern 100====
At the start of the season Martin confirmed his intention to compete at the 2017 [[Southern 100]] races on the Isle of Man. However following the problems with the Honda CBR1000RR SP2 at the TT races, Martin decided not to participate at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/other-sport/guy-martin-miss-southern-100-164732|title=No Southern comfort for Guy!|date=4 July 2017|publisher=|via=www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ulster Grand Prix====
On 21 July 2017, Honda Racing, an English company based in [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]], [[Lincolnshire]] also known as ''Honda Racing CBR'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hondaracingcbr.com/calendar/ Honda Racing, calendar 2017] Retrieved 29 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://business-directory.autosport.com/company/2586/honda-racing?cid=166 Honda Racing at Autosport Directory] Retrieved 29 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; issued a statement to the effect that Guy Martin would not be competing at the 2017 [[Ulster Grand Prix]]; the decision was described by an event organiser as "''Naturally I'm disappointed...but it's not altogether surprising given the difficulties the team has experienced throughout the season''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visordown.com/motorcycle-racing-news-road-racing/guy-martin-out-ulster-grand-prix|title=Guy Martin out of Ulster Grand Prix|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement from motorcycle racing==
On 26 July 2017, it was officially announced that Guy Martin had retired from motorcycle racing. In an exclusive interview with the ''[[Motorcycle News]]'' Martin said:

{{cquote|Racing's been good to me, but I'm bored of it. You spend the early part of the year preparing for the season – testing, racing, talking about it, and then doing it all over again. It's like Groundhog Day. It's time to stop.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motorcyclenews.com/sport/tt-road-races/2017/july/roads-guy-martin-calls-time-on-road-racing/ Exclusive: Guy Martin calls time on road racing].

==Mountain bike racing and Pedal cars==
Martin has successfully raced [[mountain bike]]s in cross country, downhill races and endurance races. In June 2011, after two years of training, he raced in the [[Salzkammergut]] Trophy in Austria. With a time of 14 hours 40 minutes, he was the first British non-professional rider to finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-262200804.html|title=Relentless Suzuki by TAS Racing's Guy Martin left his leathers at home last weekend to tackle the toughest one-day Mountain Bike race in the world: the Salzkammergut Trophy in Austria.|website=www.highbeam.com|publisher=Sunday Life (Belfast, Northern Ireland)|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He achieved his goal of a podium-finish during a 2013 British Championship event in [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YCCrCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=2013+championship+mountain+bike+cross+country+guy+martin#v=onepage&amp;q=2013%20championship%20mountain%20bike%20cross%20country%20guy%20martin Guy Martin:My Autobiography] p.167, at Google books.

=== Engineering ===

====''The Boat that Guy Built''====
This six-part series sees Martin renovates a narrow boat, called ''Reckless'', travelling on the canal network using the inventions of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The programme includes reconstructions of early industrial processes such as smelting iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.historyextra.com/tv-and-radio/boat-guy-built|title=The Boat that Guy Built|publisher=BBC History Magazine|accessdate=2010-02-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924031546/http://www.historyextra.com/tv-and-radio/boat-guy-built|archive-date=24 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''How Britain Worked''====
&lt;!-- [[How Britain Worked]] links here --&gt;
This six-part series examined some of the important engineering advances at the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Feeling the country had lost its reputation as the workshop of the world and "went soft" under the auspices of health and safety culture, through replicating original working methods in various practical projects, the series was to highlight the ordinary workers who were experiencing long hours while working to remarkable precision, "within a couple of thousandths of an inch".&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

===== Severn Valley Railway =====
In this episode, Martin helps to overhaul and later drives a steam locomotive on the [[Severn Valley Railway]], Shropshire, in the process working on its boiler, safety valves and a wheel. Using Victorian methods, he also lays some track, forges a coal shovel out of wrought iron, and repairs a 100-year-old train driver's pocket watch.

===== Yorkshire Saw Mill =====
In this episode, Martin helps to repair the world's oldest surviving [[water turbine]] used to power [[Gayle Mill, North Yorkshire|Gayle Mill]], a saw mill in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire. Felling a tree by hand, he transports the lumber to the mill by steam [[traction engine]], to build a replica of the first pedal-powered bicycles. Also covered is the migration of farm workers to city factories, displaced by mechanisation.

===== Victorian Seaside Resort =====
In this episode, Martin helps with winter maintenance on attractions in the Welsh resort of [[Llandudno]], working on [[Llandudno Pier|the pier]], a [[Helter skelter (ride)|helter-skelter]] ride, and the [[Great Orme Tramway]]. He also participates in a promenade concert, and covers the Victorian craze of [[sea bathing]].

===== Newcomen Beam Engine =====
In this episode, Martin helps to restore the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen beam engine]] in the [[Black Country Living Museum]], including making [[fire brick]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s using the original methods, restoring the timber frame, renovate the mechanical parts and clean the boiler. Covering Victorian mining methods Martin goes down the museum's mine shaft.

===== Brixham Sailing Trawler =====
In this episode, Martin helps to restore the oldest surviving [[Brixham trawler|Brixham sailing trawler]], using traditional carpentry and rope making techniques (on rope making machines used for [[HMS Victory]]), as well as testing a self-made period life jacket. Examining the growth in popularity for [[fish and chips]], he takes a trip on a deep sea [[Fishing trawler|trawler]].

===== Birmingham Botanical Gardens =====
In this episode, Martin helps to restore [[Birmingham Botanical Gardens]], learning the Victorian method for [[glassblowing]] for the greenhouse panes, rebuilding the very first lawnmower, and for building a rockery. He covers the engineering behind the Victorian fashion for collecting plants from around the world, to be shown off in extravagant botanical gardens.

==== ''Guy Martin's Spitfire'' ====
Guy Martin joins the two-year build sequence of a replica [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire I]], N3200, coded 'QV', that was buried in a French beach for 46 years (1940–1986), and tells the [[Boy's Own]]-style story of its pilot, [[Geoffrey D. Stephenson|Squadron Leader Geoffrey Stephenson]]. Saltwater corrosion ensured very little (if anything) was safely usable on a flying replica.

====''Guy Martin: Last Flight of the Vulcan Bomber''====
In this feature length one off special, Martin follows the final flights of the Cold War era [[Avro Vulcan]] Delta winged jet bomber  [[Avro Vulcan XH558|XH558 ''Spirit of Great Britain'']]. Having been restored to flight in 2007 by a charitable trust, it had been the last flying Vulcan, performing displays every year, until it was decided 2015 would be its last season due to its age and associated insurmountable engineering issues. Its last flight occurred on 28 October 2015. Martin joins the team with four months left, and once certified by the team's chief engineer, is permitted to assist in preparing it for a 1,000 mile farewell tour, as it is jacked up for a vertical alignment test. Examining the design and history, he also meets former Vulcan pilots and the [[Red Arrows]], who display with the aircraft, and aerial footage tracks it on the tours. Since in-flight cockpit access is only granted to Vulcan crew, he also flies alongside it in a formation with other aircraft. He also takes the controls of one of the other surviving Vulcans in taxiable condition, for a fast taxi manoeuvre (ground run to the point of nose lift).

=== Racing and speed ===

==== ''TT3D: Closer to the Edge'' ====
{{Main|TT3D: Closer to the Edge}}
''[[TT3D: Closer to the Edge]]'' is a documentary film about the Isle of Man TT races. The film examines what motivates the riders who race the TT and risk everything to become "King of the Mountain". Filmed in 3D, the film is a story about freedom of choice and the strength of human spirit. The film follows the leading riders in the 2010 race meeting, in particular Martin and [[Ian Hutchinson (motorcycle racer)|Ian Hutchinson]].

====''Speed with Guy Martin''====
{{Main|Speed with Guy Martin}}
In this series, Martin attempts various challenges based on speed using a variety of vehicles, mostly featuring record attempts. Three series of four hour-long episode were broadcast, along with three special episodes. This was despite Martin's reluctance to film a thord series, saying that he would prefer to "move on while we are ahead", continuing with a few one off specials.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;

==== ''Guy Martin's Wall of Death: Live'' ====
In this live special, Martin attempted to set a world speed record on a purpose built version of the [[wall of death]] fairground attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/27/guy-martin-wall-of-death-world-speed-record|title=Guy Martin attempts to beat wall of death speed record on live TV|last=Thorpe|first=Vanessa|date=2016-03-26|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also featured recordings of Martin being trained by experienced rider Ken Fox on an existing wall to overcome dizziness, and being given aerial training to overcome the chief limiting factor, the effect of [[G-force]] on the human body. The science was explored by Hugh Hunt of Cambridge University, revealing the equation G=S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(25*D), where G is G-Force, S is speed in mph, and D is diameter of the wall, in metres. This revealed the chosen location, a hangar on Manby Airfield, would be too small for Martin's desired target of 100&amp;nbsp;mph, but with a revised target of 80&amp;nbsp;mph while remaining below 7G, the 37.5 metre wall that was ultimately built would suffice. This would allow Martin to challenge a previous claimed record of around 70&amp;nbsp;mph, which the programme believed was wrong, determined through video analysis as having been 45&amp;nbsp;mph. For the show, Guinness World Records created a new record, Highest speed on a Wall of Death, and set an initial qualifying benchmark of 60&amp;nbsp;mph in one of two attempts. On a first attempt, using an [[Indian Scout (motorcycle)|Indian Scout]] motorcycle, Martin managed to achieve 70.33&amp;nbsp;mph, while on a second run, on a bike purposely built by Martin (a 1972 Rob North T160 Trident triple), he extended the record to 125.77&amp;nbsp;km/h (78.15&amp;nbsp;mph). Prior to Martin's attempt, on the smaller wall cyclist [[Shanaze Reade]] also set the Guinness record for Highest bicycle speed on a Wall of Death, at 42.94&amp;nbsp;km/h (26.68&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/science-behind-remarkable-new-wall-of-death-motorcycle-world-record-57018|title=Science behind remarkable new Wall of Death motorcycle world record|last=Hunt|first=Hugh|website=The Conversation|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Guy Martin's Passion for Life''====
This one-off half hour programme explored various aspects of Martin's life. It was a repackaging of material previously released as four 7 minute long online only episodes, under Channel 4's Shorts brand, on their online platform [[All 4|4oD]]. Episodes "Prized Possession" and "TT Racer" were released on 18 August 2014, followed by "Inside the Mind of a Racer" and "Proud Mechanic" on 1 October 2014. Proud Possession focuses on his Merlin engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/channel-4-announces-one-off-guy-martin-show-for-christmas|title=Channel 4 announces one-off Guy Martin show for Christmas - Channel 4 - Info - Press|website=www.channel4.com|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Our Guy in Latvia'' ====
Guy travelled to [[Latvia]] to investigate the history of the Latvian side of his family – his deceased maternal grandfather, Walter Kidals, was a Latvian who had come to Britain in 1947 as a refugee from [[World War II]]. The family knew little about his story, even his wife had been unaware he was an orphan. Born Waldemars Kidals, the programme found that in 1941 he had been conscripted into the [[Latvian Legion]], part of the Axis Forces when Nazi Germany had occupied Latvia, and later spent two years in a Belgian prisoner-of-war camp. Having been exonerated by the post-war trials, and with Latvia now part of the Soviet Union, all surviving former Latvian conscripts were allowed to settle in the United States and Britain as political refugees – Walter opted for the UK, travelling to Hull.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

In the programme, Martin met surviving members of his family and visited the now cleared site of his family's former farmhouse. Travelling in a 1982 Lada 1300S, he also visited an immersive Cold War Russian prison experience, and watched a reenactment of a battle between the Legion forces and the Soviet Red Army.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

====''Our Guy In India''====
Guy Martin is shown embarking on a 1,000-mile motorbike trip, as he explores rarely seen aspects of modern [[India]] en route to [[Rider Mania]], described as "one of the world's maddest bike races".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/our-guy-in-india|title=Our Guy in India|work=Channel 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Our Guy In China''====
Guy Martin's love of industry and endeavour leads him to [[China]], where he reveals the unseen side of its innovation, technological development and gigantic manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/our-guy-in-china/episode-guide|title=Our Guy in China|work=Channel 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Martin lives in [[Kirmington]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk/news/scunthorpe-news/guy-martin-reveals-north-lincolnshire-88109 Guy Martin reveals his North Lincolnshire home is where his heart is in new book, When You Dead, You Dead - Scunthorpe Telegraph] Retrieved 2018-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; a village around {{convert|19|mi}} away from his workplace in Grimsby.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; At age 24 he was living on his girlfriend's parents' farm.&lt;ref name=":28"/&gt; {{as of|2015|February|}} he was preparing to move a short distance, to a smaller house, but with more shed space.&lt;ref name=":28"/&gt;

He has two sisters and a brother. His brother, Stuart, is also a truck mechanic and motorbike racer. His younger sister, Kate, was the first female mechanic in the BSB paddock before leaving to start a family with two-times TT sidecar winner, [[2013 Isle of Man TT#Race Results|Patrick Farrance]].

Aside from a summer living in [[Ireland]], Martin has always lived in [[North Lincolnshire]].

He lives with his partner, Sharon, whom he met at a moped race in Ireland; she was working for a publisher in Dublin, and moved over to Lincolnshire in 2014.&lt;ref name=":28"/&gt;

He likes the slightly backwards nature of Lincolnshire, comparing it to rural [[Cuba]] when he visited. His flying visits to London only make him appreciate home more.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

Martin was often joined by friends on his TV shows. In ''The Boat that Guy Built'' he was accompanied by childhood friend Mark "Mavis" Davies, who also appeared in two episodes of ''How Britain Worked'', as did his former girlfriend Stephanie when descending the museum's mine shaft with Martin in episode 4. In the Pike's Peak episode of ''Speed'' he is accompanied to the US by his friend Cameron Whitworth, a race mechanic with 17 TT wins, who declined to ride or even sit on the bike due to its power. Having never met before, Martin developed a friendship with [[David Coulthard]] while filming the F1 special of ''Speed'', leading to Couthard's later appearance as a guest in ''Guy Martin's Wall of Death: Live.'' Also appearing was Martin's partner, Sharon alongside his family as did friend and mentor, Ken Fox.

His best friend is Johnny Ellis, who has also been one of his race-mechanics at various times during his career. Although Ellis and Martin had attended the same school, Vale Academy, both being in the same year, they had not been close, Martin observing he was a "bit flash" when he once turned up at school on a motorbike. Their friendship developed after Martin joined John Hebb Volvo, where Ellis worked; both being keen to work on trucks during their free time outside school, never knowing their mutual interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCCrCQAAQBAJ|title=Guy Martin: My Autobiography|last=Martin|first=Guy|date=2015-05-21|publisher=Virgin Books|isbn=9780753555033|page=52|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iain Harrison''' is a competitive shooter and former [[British Army]] Captain. He is known for being the winner of the [[Top Shot (season 1)|first season]] of [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'s marksmen competition ''[[Top Shot]]'' and the current editor of ''[[RECOIL (gun magazine)|RECOIL]]''.

==Biography==

Harrison was born in the [[United Kingdom]]. He served as a recce platoon commander for the [[British Army]]. He moved to the [[United States]] and started working as a construction manager in [[Sherwood, Oregon]] after being forced to surrender his guns to the UK government, while pursuing competitive shooting.&lt;ref name="Networks2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=A+E Networks|editor=Colby Donaldson|title=Top Shot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLEgWataxHUC&amp;pg=PT120|date= 2012|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-60878-4|pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Harrison finished second in Trooper Class in the 2009 MGM Ironman multi-gun competition. Being an amateur [[gunsmith]], the guns he used during the competition were made by himself. Harrison worked for [[Crimson Trace]] at this time.&lt;ref name="Adams2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Chad|title=Complete Guide to 3-Gun Competition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4_Jm938yX8C&amp;pg=PA56|date=18 July 2012|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-2867-1|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, Harrison gained US citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/top-shot-winner-becomes-us-citizen/|title=Top Shot Winner Becomes U.S. Citizen|year=2011 |location=Joint Base Lewis McChord, Washington|publisher=American Rifleman|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison became the editor of ''[[RECOIL (gun magazine)|RECOIL]]'' in January 2013; he writes several articles for each issue as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soldiersystems.net/2013/06/07/recoil-issue-7-in-stores/|title= Recoil Issue 7 In Stores Now|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Top Shot''===

In 2010, Harrison appeared in the [[Top Shot (season 1)|first season]] of [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'s marksmen competition ''[[Top Shot]]''. During the first half of the competition, Harrison competed as part of the Blue Team. His team ended up winning six challenges, and Harrison was only nominated for elimination once during that period. During the final half of the competition, Harrison won the last two individual challenges before the final. In the finale, he beat Chris Cerino to win the competition as well as $100,000.

Harrison has since made three appearances on the show as a weapons trainer. His first appearance after winning was on the tenth episode of the [[Top Shot (season 2)|second season]] of the show. During one episode of the [[Top Shot (season 3)|third season]] of the show, Harrison appeared with Season 2 winner, [[Chris Reed (marksman)|Chris Reed]], serving as honorary team captains of the two current Blue and Red teams for one of the challenges. A $5,000 donation was made to a charity selected by the captain of the winning team, and Harrison chose the [[Wounded Warrior Project]]. However, his team lost to Chris Reed's Red team. He appeared again as a trainer during the [[Top Shot (season 4)|fourth season]].

==Language==
{{main|Ijaw languages}}
[[File:IjawHistory.jpeg|240px|Map showing Ijaw (Ijo) area in Nigeria|thumb]]
The Ijaw speak nine closely related [[Niger–Congo languages]], all of which belong to the [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]] branch of the Niger–Congo tree. The primary division between the [[Ijo languages]] is that between Eastern Ijo and Western Ijo, the most important of the former group of languages being [[Izon language|Izon]], which is spoken by about five million people.

There are two prominent groupings of the Izon language. The first, termed either Western or Central Izon (Ijaw) consists of Western Ijaw speakers: [[Tuomo| Tuomo Clan]], [[Ekeremor clan|Ekeremor]], [[Mein clan|Sagbama (Mein)]], [[Bassan clan|Bassan]], [[Western Apoi clan|Apoi]], [[Arogbo clan|Arogbo]], [[Boma clan|Boma]] (Bumo), [[Kabo clan|Kabo (Kabuowei)]], Ogboin, Tarakiri, and Kolokuma-Opokuma.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} [[Nembe clan|Nembe]], [[Brass clan|Brass]] and [[Akassa clan|Akassa]] (Akaha) dialects represent Southeast Ijo (Izon).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}. [[Buseni clan|Buseni]] and [[Okordia clan|Okordia]] dialects are considered Inland Ijo.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The other major Ijaw linguistic group is [[Kalabari people|Kalabari]]. Kalabari is considered an Eastern Ijaw language but the term "Eastern Ijaw" is not the normal nomenclature. Kalabari is the name of one of the Ijaw clans that reside on the eastern side of the Niger-Delta (Abonnema, Buguma, Bakana, Degema etc.) who form a major group in Rivers State, Other "Eastern" Ijaw clans are the Andoni, [[Okrika]], Ibani (the natives of Bonny, Finima and Opobo) and [[Nkoroo]]. They are neighbours to the [[Kalabari people]] in present-day [[Rivers State]], [[Nigeria]].

Other related Ijaw subgroups which have distinct languages but very close kinship, cultural and territorial ties with the rest of the Ijaw are the [[Epie-Atissa people|Epie-Atissa]], [[Engenni people|Engenni]] (also known as Ẹgẹnẹ), and [[Udekama|Degema]] (also called Udekama or Udekaama).&lt;ref&gt;Kari 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ogbia]] clan, as well as residents of Bukuma and Abuloma ([[Obulom]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

It was discovered in the 1980s that a now extinct [[Berbice Creole Dutch]], spoken in Guyana, is partly based on Ijo [[lexicon]] and [[grammar]]. Its nearest relative seems to be Eastern Ijo, most likely Kalabari (Kouwenberg 1994).

==Clans==
The Ijaw ethnic group consists of 50 loosely affiliated clans. These clans are based along kinship lines and/or shared cultural and religious traditions.

==Traditional occupations==
[[File:IjoMask1.jpg|200px|thumb|An Ijaw mask]]
The Ijaw were one of the first of Nigeria's peoples to have contact with Westerners, and were active as go-betweens in the slave trade between visiting Europeans and the peoples of the interior, particularly in the era before the discovery of [[quinine]], when West Africa was still known as the "White Man's Graveyard" because of the endemic presence of [[malaria]].  Some of the kin-based trading lineages that arose among the Ijaw developed into substantial corporations which were known as "houses"; each house had an elected leader as well as a fleet of war canoes for use in protecting trade and fighting rivals.  The other main occupation common among the Ijaw has traditionally been fishing and farming.

Being a maritime people, many Ijaws were employed in the merchant shipping sector in the early and mid-20th century (pre-Nigerian independence).  With the advent of oil and gas exploration in their territory, some are employed in that sector.  Other main occupation are in the civil service of the Nigerian states of [[Bayelsa]] and [[Rivers]] where they are predominant.

Extensive state-government sponsored overseas [[scholarship]] programs in the 1970s and 1980s have also led to a significant presence of Ijaw [[professionals]] in Europe and North America (the so-called Ijaw diaspora).  Another contributing factor to this [[human capital flight]] is the abject poverty in their homeland of the [[Niger Delta]], resulting from decades of neglect by the Nigerian government and oil companies in spite of continuous petroleum prospecting in this region since the 1950s.

==Lifestyle==
The Ijaw people live by fishing supplemented by farming [[Paddy field|paddy]]-[[rice]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[Cassava]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], cocoyams, [[banana]]s and other vegetables as well as tropical fruits such as [[guava]], [[mangoes]] and [[pineapple]]s; and trading. Smoke-dried fish, [[timber]], [[palm oil]] and [[Arecaceae|palm]] [[seed|kernel]]s are processed for export. While some clans (those to the east- [[Akassa]], [[Nembe]], [[Kalabari]], [[Okrika]] and [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]]) had powerful chiefs and a [[Social stratification|stratified society]], other clans are believed not to have had any centralized confederacies until the arrival of the British.  However, owing to influence of the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Benin]] individual communities even in the western [[Niger Delta]] also had chiefs and governments at the village level.

Marriages are completed by the payment of a bridal [[dowry]], which increases in size if the bride is from another village (so as to make up for that village's loss of her children). [[Funeral]] ceremonies, particularly for those who have accumulated wealth and respect, are often very dramatic.  Traditional religious practices center around "Water spirits" in the Niger river, and around tribute to [[ancestors]].

==Religion and cultural practices==
Although the Ijaw are now primarily [[Christian]]s (65% profess to be), with [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Anglicanism]] and [[Pentecostal]] being the varieties of Christianity most prevalent among them, they also have elaborate traditional religious practices of their own.  Veneration of ancestors plays a central role in Ijaw traditional religion, while water spirits, known as ''Owuamapu'' figure prominently in the Ijaw pantheon.  In addition, the Ijaw practice a form of [[divination]] called ''Igbadai'', in which recently deceased individuals are interrogated on the causes of their death. 
Ijaw religious beliefs hold that water spirits are like humans in having personal strengths and shortcomings, and that humans dwell among the water spirits before being born.  The role of prayer in the traditional Ijaw system of belief is to maintain the living in the good graces of the water spirits among whom they dwelt before being born into this world, and each year the Ijaw hold celebrations in honor the spirits lasting for several days. Central to the festivities is the role of masquerades, in which men wearing elaborate outfits and carved masks dance to the beat of drums and manifest the influence of the water spirits through the quality and intensity of their dancing. Particularly spectacular masqueraders are taken to actually be in the possession of the particular spirits on whose behalf they are dancing.

The Ijaw are also known to practice [[ritual]] [[acculturation]] ([[enculturation]]), whereby an individual from a different, unrelated group undergoes rites to become Ijaw. An example of this is [[Jaja of Opobo]], the Igbo slave who rose to become a powerful [[Kingdom of Bonny|Ibani]] (Bonny) chief in the 19th century.

There are also a small number of [[Converts to Islam]] the most notable being the founder of the [[Delta People Volunteer Force]], [[Mujahid Dokubo-Asari]]. [[Jeremiah Omoto Fufeyin]] comes from the Ijaw ethnic group.

==Food customs==
Like many ethnic groups in Nigeria, the Ijaws have many local foods that are not widespread in Nigeria. Many of these foods involve fish and other seafoods such as clams, oysters and periwinkles; yams and plantains. Some of these foods are:
*'''Polofiyai''' &amp;mdash; A very rich soup made with yams and palm oil
*'''Kekefiyai'''&amp;mdash; A pottage made with chopped unripened (green) plantains, fish, other seafood or [[game]] [[meat]] ("[[bushmeat]]") and palm oil
*'''Fried or roasted fish and plantain''' &amp;mdash; Fish fried in palm oil and served with fried plantains
*'''Gbe''' &amp;mdash; The grub of the raffia-palm tree beetle that is eaten raw, dried, fried in groundnut oil or pickled in palm oil
*'''Kalabari "sea-harvest" fulo'''&amp;mdash; A rich mixed seafood soup or stew that is eaten with [[foofoo]], rice or yams
*'''Owafiya (Beans Pottage)''' &amp;mdash; A pottage made with [[Beans]], palm oil, fish or bushmeat, Yam or Plantain. Then taken with processed Cassava or Starch.
*'''Geisha Soup''' &amp;mdash; This a kind of soup cooked from the geisha fish, with just adding,  pepe, salt, water and Boiling it for some minutes.
*'''Opuru-fulou''' &amp;mdash; Also referred to as prawn soup, prepared mainly with prawn, Ogbono ([[Irvingia_gabonensis|Irvingia gabonensis seeds]]), dried fish, table salt, crayfish, onions, fresh pepper, and red palm oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benjamin |first1=Amadi |last2=Dikhioye |first2=Peters |last3=Emmanuel |first3=Agomuo |last4=Peter |first4=Amadi |last5=Grace |first5=Denson |title=NUTRIENT COMPOSITION OF SOME SELECTED TRADITIONAL FOODS OF IJAW PEOPLE OF BAYELSA STATE |journal=Polish Journal of Natural Sciences |date=2018 |volume=33 |issue=1 |page=59-74 |url=http://www.uwm.edu.pl/polish-journal/issues/no-3312018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic identity==
Formerly organized into several loose clusters of villages ([[Confederation|confederacies]]) which cooperated to defend themselves against outsiders, the Ijaw increasingly view themselves as belonging to a single coherent nation, bound together by ties of language and culture. This tendency has been encouraged in large part by what are considered to be environmental degradations that have accompanied the exploitation of oil in the Niger delta region which the Ijaw call home, as well as by a revenue sharing formula with the Nigerian Federal government that is viewed by the Ijaw as manifestly unfair. The resulting sense of grievance has led to several high-profile clashes with the Nigerian Federal authorities, including kidnappings and in the course of which many lives have been lost. The Ijaw people are resilient and proud. Long before after the colonial era, the Ijaw people traveled by wooded boats and canoes to Cameroun, Ghana and other West African countries. They traveled up the River Niger from River Nun.

==Ijaw-Itsekiri conflicts==
{{main| Warri Crisis}}

One manifestation of ethnic violence on the part of the Ijaw has been an increase in the number and severity of clashes between Ijaw militants and those of [[Itsekiri]] origin, particularly in the town of [[Warri, Nigeria|Warri]].

Deadly conflicts had rocked the South-South region, especially in Delta State, where intertribal killings had resulted in death in both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationng.com/2013/07/communal-clash-causes-tension-in-delta-as-ijaw-youths-kill-four-itsekiri.html |title=Communal Clash Causes Tension In Delta As Ijaw Youths Kill Four Itsekiri &amp;#124; INFORMATION NIGERIA |publisher=Informationng.com |date=2013-07-03 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, local police discovered mutilated corpses of 13 Itsekiris killed by Ijaws, over dispute over the candidate for a local council chairman. Several Itsekiri villages, including Gbokoda, Udo, Ajamita, Obaghoro and Ayerode-Zion on the Benin river axis, were razed down while several Itsekiris lost their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2013/07/09/ijawitsekiri-crisis-police-recover-gory-corpses-slain-uduaghan-kinsmen |title=Ijaw/Itsekiri Crisis: Police Recover Gory Corpses Of Slain Uduaghan Kinsmen |publisher=Sahara Reporters |date=2013-07-09 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil conflict==
{{main|Nigerian Oil Crisis}}
The December 1998 All Ijaw Youths Conference crystallized the struggle with the formation of the [[Ijaw Youth Movement]] (IYM) and the issuing of the [[Kaiama Declaration]]. In it, long-held Ijaw concerns about the loss of control of their homeland and their own lives to the oil companies were joined with a commitment to direct action. In the declaration, and in a letter to the companies, the Ijaws called for oil companies to suspend operations and withdraw from Ijaw territory. The IYM pledged “to struggle peacefully for freedom, self-determination and ecological justice,” and prepared a campaign of celebration, prayer, and direct action '[[Operation Climate Change]]' beginning December 28, 1998.

In December 1998, two warships and 10-15,000 Nigerian troops occupied Bayelsa and Delta states as the [[Ijaw Youth Movement]] (IYM) mobilized for [[Operation Climate Change]].  Soldiers entering the Bayelsa state capital of Yenagoa announced they had come to attack the youths trying to stop the oil companies. On the morning of December 30, 1998, two thousand young people processed through Yenagoa, dressed in black, singing and dancing. Soldiers opened fire with rifles, machine guns, and tear gas, killing at least three protesters and arresting twenty-five more. After a march demanding the release of those detained was turned back by soldiers, three more protesters were shot dead including Nwashuku Okeri, Ghadafi Ezeifile and Onwinkron Ibe. The head of Yenagoa rebels- Chief Onwinkron Ibe- was burned alive in his mansion on December 28, 1998. Amongst his family members to flee the premises before complete ruins was his only son, Desmond Ibe. The military declared a state of emergency throughout Bayelsa state, imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew, and banned meetings. At military roadblocks, local residents were severely beaten or detained. At night, soldiers invaded private homes, terrorizing residents with beatings and women and girls with rape.

On January 4, 1999 about one hundred soldiers from the military base at [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]’s Escravos facility attacked [[Opia]] and [[Ikiyan]], two Ijaw communities in Delta State. [[Bright Pablogba]], the traditional leader of Ikiyan, who came to the river to negotiate with the soldiers, was shot along with a seven-year-old girl and possibly dozens of others. Of the approximately 1,000 people living in the two villages, four people were found dead and sixty-two were still missing months after the attack. The same soldiers set the villages ablaze, destroyed canoes and fishing equipment, killed livestock, and destroyed churches and religious shrines.

Nonetheless, Operation Climate Change continued, and disrupted Nigerian oil supplies through much of 1999 by turning off valves through Ijaw territory. In the context of high conflict between the Ijaw and the Nigerian Federal Government (and its police and army), the military carried out the [[Odi massacre]], killing scores if not hundreds of Ijaws.

Recent actions by Ijaws against the oil industry have included both renewed efforts at nonviolent action and militarized attacks on oil installations but with no human casualties to foreign oil workers despite hostage-takings.  These attacks are usually in response to non-fulfilment by oil companies of memoranda of understanding with their host communities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3825">'''Janet Campbell Hale''' (born January 11, 1946, [[Riverside, California]])&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Public Records Index'' Vol 1 &amp; 2 (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.), 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] writer. Her father was a full-blood [[Coeur d'Alene people|Coeur d'Alene]], and her mother was of [[Ktunaxa|Kootenay]], [[Cree]] and Irish descent&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hanksville.org/storytellers/jchale/.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sparse style that has been compared to Hemingway,&lt;ref&gt;http://oldmolekboo.blogspot.com/1998/02/jailing-of-cecelia-capture-by-janet.html&lt;/ref&gt; Hale's work often explores issues of Native American identity and discusses poverty, abuse, and the condition of women in society. She wrote ''Bloodlines: Odyssey of a Native Daughter'' (1993), which includes a discussion of the Native American experience as well as stories from her own life. She also wrote ''The Owl's Song'' (1974), ''The Jailing of Cecelia Capture'' (which was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 1985), ''Women on the Run'' (1999), and ''Custer Lives in Humboldt County &amp; Other Poems'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/biography/Janet-Campbell-Hale&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
''Capture'' is a major theme in Janet Campbell Hale's writing. The name of the protagonist in the eponymous ''Jailing of Cecelia Capture'' is named for ''capture,'' but is also both literally and figuratively captured at different points in the narrative. Part of the dynamics of ''Bloodlines'' is to invert the white narratives about the capture of white people by Native Americans, into an account of capture of Native peoples by European-descended people.&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ail/summary/v019/19.3finnegan.html&lt;/ref&gt; Escape and transformation of capture figure in several of her works.

'''Joseph-Marie Gros''' (23 May 1742, [[Lyon]] - 3 September 1792, [[Paris]]) was a French secular cleric and clergy deputy to the [[Estates-General of 1789]].

==Life==
After being ordained he received his theology doctorate and taught at the [[College of Navarre]] from 10 May 1785. As [[curé]] of the Paris church of [[Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet]], his charity efforts gained him the nickname of "the new [[saint Vincent de Paul]]". On 30 April 1789 he was elected a clergy deputy in the fourth place, after [[Antoine-Éléonor-Léon Leclerc de Juigné]], [[François-Xavier-Marc-Antoine de Montesquiou-Fézensac]] and abbé De Chevreuil. He sat on the right, defended the [[Ancien régime]] and took the oath on clergy goods.

He and all his parish's priests refused to preach at Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet in favour of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] and so he was dismissed from that parish and imprisoned as a counter-revolutionary in January 1791 in the [[Carmes Prison]]. He died there in the [[September Massacres]] of 1792. He was beatified on 17 October 1926 by [[pope Pius XI]] as one of the "[[Holy September Martyrs]]".

&lt;/ref&gt; is a television personality and rainforest-dweller in [[Washington_(state)|Washington]].

==Early life==
He is a native of the [[Olympic Peninsula]]. His great-grandparents settled in the region and Dodge grew up there as a child. He loved the outdoors. Dodge also lived in many other places around the country and the world as the son of a career Marine,&lt;ref name="Barefoot"&gt;[http://www.odditycentral.com/news/the-barefoot-sensei-former-marine-left-everything-behind-to-live-in-the-forest-barefoot.html "The Barefoot Sensei – Former Marine Left Everything Behind to Live in the Forest"], ''Oddity Central'', January 30th, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/01/07/2981340_mick-dodge-rain-forest-dweller.html?rh=1 "Mick Dodge, rain forest dweller"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114808/http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/01/07/2981340_mick-dodge-rain-forest-dweller.html?rh=1 |date=2014-08-26 }} ''The News Tribune'', January 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald L. Dodge.&lt;ref name="PDNews" /&gt; The younger Dodge graduated from high school in Okinawa, Japan. He enlisted in the Marine Corps and served for six years.&lt;ref name="PDNews" /&gt;

==In the forest==
Dodge decided to leave the modern world and retreat to the dense forest due to the stress of modern living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/stories/he-lives-in-a-tree-doesnt-wear-shoes-and-brushes-his "He lives in a tree, doesn't wear shoes, and brushes his teeth with a pinecone], ''[[MNN.com]]'' January 07, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He was nicknamed "The Barefoot Sensei" due to his preference to not wear shoes or sandals when walking in the forest. Since 1991, he has been living barefoot, a decision that he believed helped cure him of [[plantar fasciitis]], back pain and [[hammer toe]]s. He also felt that it helped him connect more intuitively with the natural world.&lt;ref name="Barefoot" /&gt;

==EarthGym program==
Despite the preference to be separated from modern civilization, Dodge is still involved with the community. In 1994, he and Jacquie Chandler created an earth-based fitness program they called The EarthGym,  a fitness program in the forest where nature provides most of the equipment for physical training.&lt;ref&gt;cat man [http://www.theearthgym.com/#!mick-dodge/c24jz "Mick Dodge bio, the Barefoot Sensei - The EarthGym"], Retrieved on 16 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Dodge is the subject of the [[National Geographic Channel]] reality TV series ''[[The Legend of Mick Dodge]]'', about his unusual life dwelling in a forest.&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/the-legend-of-mick-dodge/articles/meet-mick-dodge/ "The Legend of Mick Dodge | National Geographic Channel"], ''National Geographic Channel''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders Who was born in Newgate, and during a life of continu'd Variety for Threescore Years, besides her Childhood, was Twelve Years a Whore, five times a Wife (whereof once to her brother) Twelve Years a Thief, Eight Years a Transported Felon in Virginia, at last grew Rich, liv'd Honest and died a Penitent''''' (commonly known simply as '''''Moll Flanders''''') is a novel by [[Daniel Defoe]], first published in 1722. It purports to be the true account of the life of the eponymous Moll, detailing her exploits from birth until old age.

By 1721, Defoe had become a recognised novelist, with the success of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' in 1719. His political work was tapering off at this point, due to the fall of both [[British Whig Party|Whig]] and [[British Tory Party|Tory]] party leaders with whom he had been associated; [[Robert Walpole]] was beginning his rise, and Defoe was never fully at home with the Walpole group. Defoe's Whig views are nevertheless evident in the story of Moll, and the novel's full title gives some insight into this and the outline of the plot:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The fortunes and misfortunes of the famous Moll Flanders, &amp;c.

It is usually assumed that the novel was written by Daniel Defoe, and his name is commonly given as the author in modern printings of the novel. However, the original printing did not have an author, as it was an apparent autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/xjf440699eng/title-page-for-moll-flanders-by-daniel-defoe-published-1722-xjf440699-eng/#.Wfd3Zmd-6-w|title=Title Page for 'Moll Flanders' by Daniel Defoe, published 1722|website=PBS LearningMedia|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution of ''Moll Flanders'' to Defoe was made by bookseller Francis Noble in 1770, after Defoe's death in 1731.&lt;ref&gt;Furbank and Owens "The Canonisation of Daniel Defoe" (1988); "Defoe De-Attributions" (1994) and "A Critical Bibliography of Daniel Defoe" (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel is based partially on the life of [[Elizabeth Adkins|Moll King]], a London criminal whom Defoe met while visiting [[Newgate Prison]].

==Plot summary==
[[File:Moll Flanders.png|thumb|left|upright|250px|Illustration of an 18th-century chapbook.]]
Moll's mother is a convict in [[Newgate Prison]] in London who is given a reprieve by "[[pleading the belly|pleading her belly]]," a reference to the custom of staying the executions of pregnant criminals. Her mother is eventually [[convict transportation|transported]] to [[Colonial United States]], and Moll Flanders (not her birth name, she emphasizes, taking care not to reveal it) is raised from the age of three until adolescence by a kindly foster mother. Thereafter she gets attached to a household as a servant where she is loved by both sons, the elder of whom convinces her to "act like they were married" in bed. Unwilling to marry her, he persuades her to marry his younger brother. After five years of marriage, she then is widowed, leaves her children in the care of in-laws, and begins honing the skill of passing herself off as a fortuned widow to attract a man who will marry her and provide her with security.

The first time she does this, her "gentleman-tradesman" spendthrift husband goes bankrupt and flees to the Continent, leaving her on her own with his blessing to do the best she can to forget him. (They had one child together, but "it was buried.") The second time, she makes a match that leads her to [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia Colony]] with a kindly man who introduces her to his mother. After three children (one dies), Moll learns that her mother-in-law is actually her biological mother, which makes her husband her half-brother. She dissolves their marriage and after continuing to live with her brother for three years, travels back to England, leaving her two children behind, and goes to live in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to seek a new husband.

Again she returns to her [[confidence trick|con skills]] and develops a relationship with a man in Bath whose wife is elsewhere confined due to insanity. Their relationship is at first platonic, but eventually develops into Moll becoming something of a "[[kept woman]]" in [[Hammersmith]], London. They have three children (one lives), but after a severe illness he repents, breaks off the arrangement, and commits to his wife.  However, he assures Moll that their son will be well cared for, so she leaves yet another child behind.

Moll, now 42, resorts to another beau, a bank clerk, who while still married to an adulterous wife (a "whore"), proposes to Moll after she entrusts him with her financial holdings. While waiting for the banker to divorce, Moll pretends to have a great fortune to attract another wealthy husband [[Lancashire]], assisted by a new female acquaintance who attests to Moll's (erroneous) social standing. The ruse is successful and she marries a supposedly rich man who claims to own property in Ireland. They each quickly realize that they were both conned and manipulated by the before mentioned new acquaintance.  He discharges her from the marriage, telling her nevertheless that she should inherit any money he might ever get. After enjoying each other's company for about a month, they part ways, but Moll soon discovers that she is pregnant. She gives birth and the [[midwife]] gives a tripartite scale of the costs of bearing a child, with one value level per social class. She continues to correspond with the bank clerk, hoping he will still have her.

Moll leaves her newborn in the care of a countrywoman in exchange for the sum of £5 a year. Moll marries the banker, but realizes "what an abominable creature I am! and how this innocent gentleman is going to be abused by me!" They live in happiness for five years before he becomes bankrupt and dies of despair, the fate of their two children left unstated.

Truly desperate now, Moll begins a career of artful thievery, which, by employing her wits, beauty, charm, and femininity, as well as hard-heartedness and wickedness, brings her the financial security she has always sought. She becomes well known among those "in the trade," and is given the name Moll Flanders. She is helped throughout her career as a thief by her Governess, who also acts as [[Fence (criminal)|receiver]]. (During this time she briefly becomes the mistress of a man she robbed.) Moll is finally caught by two maids whilst trying to steal from a house.

In Newgate she is led to her repentance. At the same time, she reunites with her soulmate, her "Lancashire husband", who is also jailed for his robberies (before and after they first met, he acknowledges). Moll is found guilty of felony, but not burglary, the second charge; still, the sentence is death in any case. Yet Moll convinces a minister of her repentance, and together with her Lancashire husband is transported to [[Thirteen Colonies|the Colonies]] to avoid hanging, where they live happily together (she even talks the ship's captain into not being with the convicts sold upon arrival, but instead in the captain's quarters). Once in the colonies, Moll learns her mother has left her a plantation and that her own son (by her brother) is alive, as is her husband/brother.

Moll carefully introduces herself to her brother and their son, in disguise. With the help of a Quaker, the two found a farm with 50 servants in [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]]. Moll reveals herself now to her son in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] and he gives her her mother's inheritance, a farm for which he will now be her steward, providing £100 a year income for her. In turn, she makes him her heir and gives him a (stolen) gold watch.

At last, her life of conniving and desperation seems to be over. After her husband/brother dies, Moll tells her (Lancashire) husband the entire story and he is "perfectly easy on that account... For, said he, it was no fault of yours, nor of his; it was a mistake impossible to be prevented." Aged 69 (in 1683), the two return to England to live "in sincere penitence for the wicked lives we have lived."

== Marriages, relationships, and children==
Throughout the novel, Moll goes through a series of relationships, legitimate and not, and through these relationships she bears many children. The lack of character names and Defoe’s inability to keep clear distinctions between his many, nameless characters give the reader the difficult task of keeping track of not just characters as a whole, but specifically Moll’s marriages, relationships, and children, which make up a majority of her life’s story. The following maps out Moll’s relationships and marriages in the order that they appeared in the novel as well as any children that might have been born as a result of their union.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Murut''' are an indigenous [[ethnic group]], comprising 29 sub-ethnic groups inhabiting northern inland regions of [[Borneo]].

== Etymology ==
The literal translation of ''murut'' is "hill people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://indonesiatraveling.com/kalimantan/kalimantan-tribes/529-east-kalimantan-48-tribes.html literal translation of Murut]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
A large percentage of the Murut communities are in the southwest interior of [[Sabah]], [[East Malaysia]], specifically the districts of [[Keningau]], [[Tenom]], [[Nabawan]] and [[Beaufort, Malaysia|Beaufort]] along the Sapulut and Padas rivers. They can also be found inhabiting the border areas of [[Sarawak]], (especially around the [[Lawas]] and [[Limbang]] areas, where they are also referred to as Tagal people), [[North Kalimantan]] (traditionally concentrated in [[Malinau Regency|Malinau]] and [[Nunukan Regency|Nunukan]]) and [[Brunei]]. 
 
The Murut population in [[Brunei]] is mainly found in the sparsely populated [[Temburong]] district. They once supplied military might to the Sultans of Brunei. Their population has dwindled in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/cseas/pubs/brunei/brunei.html Brunei: The Abode of Peace] - Retrieved 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They are defined as one of the seven indigenous groups that are considered to be [[Bumiputera (Brunei)|Bumiputera]] in Brunei.

The Murut are divided between lowland (Timugon) and highland (Tagol) subgroups.  They speak the [[Murutic languages]], a branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian family]]. The [[Tagol Murut language]] serves as their ''[[lingua franca]]''.

The Murut were the last of Sabah's ethnic groups to renounce [[headhunting]]. As with the [[Iban people|Iban]] of [[Sarawak]], collecting heads of enemies traditionally served a very important role in Murut spiritual beliefs. For example, a man could only get married after he presented at least one head to the family of the desired girl.

[[File:Sarawak; Murut tribeswomen at a head feast. Photograph. Wellcome V0037457.jpg|thumb|left|Murut tribeswomen at a head feast in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]].]] 

The Murut were shifting cultivators of hill [[Rice|padi]] and [[tapioca]], supplementing their diet with [[Blowgun|blowpipe]] hunting and with some [[fishing]]. They live in communal [[longhouse]]s, usually near rivers, using the rivers as their highways. Most have now converted to [[Christianity]], with about a fifth of the population being Muslims. However they still maintain their culture.

Traditional dress for men was a jacket made of tree bark (Artocarpus tamaran), a red [[loincloth]], and a headdress decorated with Argus [[pheasant]] feathers. Women wore a black sleeveless blouse and [[sarong]], which fell just below the knees. Like most of the other indigenous groups in Sabah, the Murut decorated their clothing with distinctive [[beadwork]] and also made belts out of old [[silver]] coins. Another belt made of reddish-brown glass beads plus yellow and blue beads was hung loosely around the waist.

[[File:KgKuaiKandazon Sabah Monsopiad-Cultural-Village-24.jpg|thumb|right|Murut in traditional attire.]]
Murut wedding or funeral feasts can last several days. Ancient Chinese jars hold a prominent status in Murut customs. Jars are also a place of spirits, and larger jars were formerly used as coffins.

===Musical heritage===
{{main|Agung}}
The Murut have a musical heritage consisting of various types of [[Agung#In agung ensembles|agung ensembles]] - ensembles composed of large hanging, suspended or held, bossed/knobbed [[gong]]s which act as drone without any accompanying melodic instrument.&lt;ref name=Philip&gt;{{cite web

Murut also used bamboo as a musical instrument, by using bamboo to compose a songs. Some musical instrument like tangkung (similar to that of a guitar, except it has only two strings) is made from wood. Tangkung is usually played during their leisure time.

===Antanum===
{{main|Antanum}}
Antanum was a famous and influential Murut warrior from Sabah who according to local oral history claimed to have supernatural powers. Because of this he was able to receive support from the chiefs and villagers from around Keningau, Tenom, Pensiangan and [[Rundum]] and led the [[Rundum uprising]] against the [[British North Borneo Company]] but was killed during fighting with the company army in Sungai Selangit near Pensiangan.&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book | year=2008 | title=Federal-state relations in Sabah, Malaysia: the Berjaya administration, 1976-85 | author1=Regina Lim | author2=  Institute of Southeast Asian Studies | publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies | isbn=9789812308122 | page=29 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM4HifRARgYC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=%22Antanum%22 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chief Naiche''' (ca. 1857-1919) was the final hereditary [[Tribal chief|chief]] of the [[Chiricahua]] band of [[Apache Indians]].&lt;ref name=ohs&gt;Johansen, Bruce E. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/N/NA003.html "Naiche (ca. 1857—1919)."] ''Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.'' (retrieved 25 Sept 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Naiche, whose name in English means "meddlesome one" or "mischief maker", is alternately spelled Nache, Nachi, or Natchez.&lt;ref name=ohs/&gt;

He was the youngest son of [[Cochise]] and his wife [[Dos-teh-seh]] (''Dos-tes-ey'', - "Something-at-the-campfire-already-cooked", b. 1838), His older brother was [[Tah-zay]] aka [[Chief Taza]].&lt;ref name="Delgadillo2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Delgadillo|first=Alicia|title=From Fort Marion to Fort Sill: A Documentary History of the Chiricahua Apache Prisoners of War, 1886-1913|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIrWsLDXRqUC&amp;pg=PA193|date=1 June 2013|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-4625-6|pages=193–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naiche was described as a tall, handsome man with a dignified bearing that reflected the Apache equivalent of a royal bloodline as the son of Cochise (leader of the Chihuicahui local group of the Chokonen and principal chief of the Chokonen band of the Chiricahua Apache) and Dos-teh-seh, daughter of the great Warm Spring/Mimbreño Chief Mangas Coloradas.&lt;ref name="Robinson2016"/&gt; [[Britton Davis]] described him as being 6'1" inheight, which was tall for an Apache.&lt;ref name="Delgadillo2013"/&gt;

He had three wives: Haozinne, E-Clah-heh and Na-deh-yole and six children.&lt;ref name="Robinson2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Sherry|title=Apache Voices: Their Stories of Survival as Told to Eve Ball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LjFIDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT77|date=25 April 2016|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-1848-0|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Upon the death of his father Cochise in 1874, Naiche's brother Taza became the chief; however, Taza died a few years later in 1876, and the office went to Naiche. In the 1880s, Naiche and Geronimo successfully went to war together.&lt;ref name="Delgadillo2013"/&gt;

In 1880, Naiche traveled to [[Mexico]] with [[Geronimo]]'s band, to avoid [[forced relocation]] to the [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation]] in [[Arizona]]. They surrendered in 1883 but escaped the reservation in 1885, back into Mexico.&lt;ref name="Sheridan1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheridan|first=Thomas E.|title=A History of the Southwest: The Land and Its People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msXwj_0eVRYC&amp;pg=PA41|year=1998|publisher=Western National Parks Association|isbn=978-1-877856-76-1|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially the leader of the last band of renegade Apaches in the Southwest, Naiche and Geronimo surrendered to General Nelson Miles in 1886.&lt;ref name="Kraft2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraft|first=Louis|title=Gatewood and Geronimo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIW7CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT203|date=1 June 2000|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-5405-1|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naiche and other Apaches requested to return to [[Arizona]], while still imprisoned in Fort Marion. The US did not allow their return, but [[Kiowa]] and [[Comanche]] tribes offered to share their reservations in southwestern [[Oklahoma]] with the Chiricahua, so Naiche and 295 members of his band moved to [[Fort Sill, Oklahoma]], where they became the [[Fort Sill Apache Tribe]]. In 1913, Naiche moved to the [[Mescalero Indian Reservation]] in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Champagne1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Champagne|first=Duane|title=Chronology of Native North American History: From Pre-Columbian Times to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=210YAAAAIAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Gale Research|isbn=978-0-8103-9195-6|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Naiche ChiriApache hidepainting 1900 OHS.jpg|right|thumb|150x150px|Naiche's painting]]
Naiche had the reputation of being the finest Indian artist of that period. He painted his pictures on deer skin in color.  His subjects were flowers, deer, other wild animals, turkey, and various objects of nature, as he saw them. He also carved canes from wood and painted them in different colors.&lt;ref name="Griffin-Pierce2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin-Pierce|first=Trudy|title=The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Southwest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdrmWsXR7poC&amp;pg=PA124|date=13 August 2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-52010-2|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Naiche died of influenza on March 16, 1919 in [[Mescalero, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=ohs/&gt;

Among his descendents:
*[[Elbys Onea Naiche Hugar]]
*[[Silas Cohise]]

==In fiction==
Naiche is one of the central characters in the novel ''Cry of Eagles'' by [[William W. Johnstone]]. The story features Naiche leading a renegade band of Apache in open warfare against white settlers and miners as they attempt to join Geronimo in Mexico. In the final chapter Naiche is killed by the books protagonist, Falcon MacCallister.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Johnstone ''Cry of Eagles''. Published October 1999, Pinnacle Books/Kennsington Publishing Corp.&lt;/ref&gt; Naiche is played by [[Rex Reason]] in [[Douglas Sirk]]'s film ''[[Taza, Son of Cochise]]''.

Naiche identified as "Chief Nachez" was a character in Season 6 Episode 22 of "The Life And Legend of Wyatt Earp".
This episode aired on March 7, 1961. In the episode the Chief Nachez character turns to [[Wyatt Earp]] for help in stopping
the selling of liquor to members of his tribe. The "Nachez" character was played by George Keymas.&lt;ref name="Lentz1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lentz|first=Harris M.|title=Television Westerns Episode Guide: All United States Series, 1949-1996|date=1 January 1997|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-7864-0377-6|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lord Wei is the son of [[British Hong Kong|Hongkong]] parents&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/100616-0006.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Hakka]] Chinese ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neehao.co.uk/2012/01/lord-weis-speech-on-the-role-of-overseas-chinese-in-britain/ |title=There is a saying, in Hakka, When everyone collects firewood, the flames rise high }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbg88.co.uk/ygxw/2012/06-27/129.shtml |title=33岁华人新贵——韦鸣恩 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016005223/http://www.cbg88.co.uk/ygxw/2012/06-27/129.shtml |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jun/22/nat-wei-big-society-adviser-conservatives |title=Interview with Mr Big Society |date=22 June 2010 |work=The Guardian |first=Randeep |last=Ramesh |accessdate=6 February 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wei's father was a pastor who moved to Britain in the 1970s.{{cn|date=September 2016}} He was born in [[Watford]] and grew up in [[Milton Keynes]] and [[Tooting]], London.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Education==
Lord Wei was educated at the Sir Frank Markham Community School, a state comprehensive school in [[Milton Keynes]] (since closed, and replaced by the [[Milton Keynes Academy]] on the same site),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/news/local/end-of-an-era-as-school-s-out-for-the-last-time-1-869843 End of an Era as School's Out for the Last Time] Published by: MiltonKeynes.co.uk Date: 21 July 2009. Retrieved 27 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; where some of the pupils snorted cocaine and even burned down a wing of the school, and bullied him for taking his studies seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/Article/1073408/Rosamund-McCarthy-baiting-Lord-Wei-unsavoury---hes-no-saint-offer/ |title=Nat Wei in Third Sector |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326133840/http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/Article/1073408/Rosamund-McCarthy-baiting-Lord-Wei-unsavoury---hes-no-saint-offer/ |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a later account of his school life, Wei appeared to contradict this account, stating that as he 'got good grades, but was also sporty', he was never targeted or bullied.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The only pupil from his school year to attend the [[University of Oxford]], he studied [[Modern Languages]] at [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jun/22/nat-wei-big-society-adviser-conservatives |title=Nat Wei Big Society Adviser Conservative | location=London | work=The Guardian |first=Randeep |last=Ramesh |date=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also actively learning [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] at the [[London School of Economics]], and has a working knowledge of [[Cantonese]], French and German.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Life and career==
After graduating from Jesus College, Oxford, Wei worked at [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] for three years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/lord-wei-shoreditch-london-borough-hackney |title=Lord Nat Wei, Government Adviser for Big Society |publisher=Cabinet Office |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he came to know Brett Wigdortz, who founded [[Teach First]] in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In 2006, after three years at Teach First and a short stint in [[social venture capital]], Wei joined the children's charity [[Absolute Return for Kids]] (ARK) where he helped to set up [[Future Leaders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jan/02/schools.uk |title=Preparing for power |work=The Guardian |date=2 January 2007 |first=Polly |last=Curtis |accessdate=6 February 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a programme seeking to attract, develop and place high-potential teachers and future leaders of urban schools.

===Founding the Shaftesbury Partnership===
Around the same time as helping to set up Future Leaders, in early 2006, Wei founded the Shaftesbury Partnership,&lt;ref name=guardianfeb11/&gt; an organisation which seeks to emulate the great [[social reform]]ers of the [[Victorian era]] by creating scalable social reforms. The Shaftesbury Partnership are currently working on a number of projects around [[House|housing]], unemployment and healthcare. Through the Shaftesbury Partnership, Wei co-founded The Challenge Network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Rentoul |title=Like it or not, there it is. A Tory policy |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/john-rentoul/john-rentoul-like-it-or-not-there-it-is-a-tory-policy-1825377.html |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=6 February 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
an independent charity which exists to "inspire and connect people to strengthen their community".  The Challenge Network runs a two-month civic service programme called The Challenge which has attracted strong interest from both government and opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Janaki |last=Mahadevan |url=http://www.cypnow.co.uk/news/ByDiscipline/Youth-Work/895212/Charity-test-concept-National-Citizen-Service/ |title=Charity to test the concept of National Citizen Service |date=2 April 2009 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Shaftesbury Partnership working with [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] and [[Queen's Nursing Institute|Queens Nursing Institute]] and [[Buckinghamshire New University]] piloted NurseFirst&lt;ref name="NurseFirst"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nursefirst.org.uk |title=NurseFirst}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a clinicians in the community development programme to produce a network of innovators who can create real change for patients, people and communities. In 2013, a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.nursefirst.org.uk/twoyearson.pdf |title=Nurse First two years on |date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the pilot, 2 years on, concluded that first cohort of clinicians showed quantitative and qualitative improvements in their confidence, their leadership skills, their ability to innovate and their ability to make clinical innovation happen. They produced financially sustainable business plans for £1.2&amp;nbsp;million of cash releasing savings over 3 years. The programme is now being scaled up.
 
For the individual, retirement – like many other life transitions – can be a challenging time, involving difficult lifestyle changes and choices. This is often compounded by other transitions such as starting to care for grandchildren, relocation, illness, and bereavement. Against the current backdrop of austerity and rising health and social care needs, there is an urgent need to support retirees in managing these transitions. Since summer 2013, after the publication of a report by Lord Wei entitled,  "Next steps: Life transitions and retirement in the 21st century”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://natwei.com/social-reform/transitions-retirement/ |title=Next steps: Life transitions and retirement in the 21st century |date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]], Shaftesbury Partnership have been developing a Retirement Transition Initiative, designed to equip people who are around the retirement transition with the information, networks, resilience, and opportunities they need to continue purposeful activity post-retirement. It will aim to improve the economic outcomes, health, and wellbeing of both the individual and their community.

=== Social reform ===
On 18 May 2010 at the launch of the [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement|New Coalition Government policies]] on [[Big Society]] to a group of community leaders, Lord Wei was appointed as an unpaid [[:wikt:advisor|Government Adviser]] on [[Big Society]]. He was based at the [[Office for Civil Society]] in the [[Cabinet Office]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/newsroom/news_releases/2010/100518-news-nat-wei.aspx |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100708170347/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/newsroom/news_releases/2010/100518-news-nat-wei.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-07-08 |title=Big Society champion appointed Government advisor |date=18 May 2010 |publisher=Cabinet Office |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked one day a week&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08zc1z9|title=Lord Wei in Milton Keynes, Series 1, A Place Called Home - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and advised the Government on all aspects of taking forward the Big Society and driving implementation across government.
[[File:Lord Wei Nomination.jpg|thumb|Press Release: General statement in response to Nat Wei’s nomination to House of Lords and appointment as advisor to the Government on Big Society]]At the launch event, the Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]], announced that Wei would also be appointed a [[life peer]]. He was [[Introduction (House of Lords)|introduced]] in the House of Lords on 3 June 2010 as '''Baron Wei''', of [[Shoreditch]] in the [[London Borough of Hackney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=59437 |date=3 June 2010 |page=10273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/100603-0001.htm#10060340000777 |title=House of Lords debates (3 June 2010, 11:00&amp;nbsp;am): Introduction: Lord Wei |publisher=Hansard : House of Lords : 3 June 2010 : Column 365 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the third person of Chinese ethnic origin to become a member of the House of Lords, after [[Lydia Dunn, Baroness Dunn|Baroness Dunn]] (who is not domiciled in the UK) and the late [[Michael Chan, Baron Chan|Lord Chan]]; the third person of Hong Kong ancestry to become a House of Lords member, after Baroness Dunn and the late [[Lord Kadoorie]]; and the first-ever member of Chinese origin to be British born. He is also one of the youngest people to have been made a life peer, at the age of 33.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Mitford, 6th Baron Redesdale|Lord Redesdale]] was slightly younger than Wei when he was made a life peer in 2000; however he had sat in the House of Lords as a hereditary peer prior to the reforms of 1999. {{cite journal |last=Randall |first=Nicholas |title=Youngest peer to take his seat |journal=The House Magazine  |date= 28 May 2010 |url=http://www.epolitix.com/house-magazine/housemag-article/newsarticle/youngest-peer-to-take-his-seat/ |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his role as Government Advisor Lord Wei stepped down from any direct, formal involvement in the organisations he had previously been involved with. On 24 May 2011, Lord Wei announced his decision to step down from his role as Government Advisor on Big Society to help as a volunteer to drive the practical development of Big Society ideas in communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13529808|title=PM's Big Society tsar stands down|date=24 May 2011 | publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat Wei's website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natwei.com/ |title=Nat Wei's website }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]] said 'Nat has worked incredibly hard over two years to help develop policies that support the Big Society. He has played an important role in delivering key initiatives like Community Organisers, [[National Citizen Service]], and the [[Big Society Capital|Big Society Bank]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/lord-wei-stands-down|title=Lord Wei stands down}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Lord Wei had also cited personal financial difficulties that he had suffered as a result of the demands of his part-time position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/how-my-top-government-job-left-me-almost-penniless-and-unable-to-support-my-family-6563509.html|title=How my top government job left me almost penniless and unable to|date=2011-02-04|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Lord Wei has been involved in a number of initiatives involving networks of individuals who have a vision to improve society, address poverty, and tackle injustice. These have been in three main areas; work to establish training and research to help people, particularly from or interested in having entrepreneurial, financial, and business backgrounds to become active and effective social reformers finding and promoting scalable solutions for today's social challenges, work to harness the power of faith based action, work to promote philanthropy among corporate business owners, to share wealth through sharing ownership to tackle poverty.

=== Chinese background ===
Lord Wei's ancestry can be traced back to a village in [[Zhuhai]], on the southern coast of the [[Guangdong]]. His ancestral home is two villages away from that of [[Sun Yat-sen]], the founding father of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], about whom incidentally, Wei enjoys reading and learning.

As the only current ethnic Chinese peer in The House of Lords, and the first member of Chinese ethnic origin to have been born and brought up in the UK, Lord Wei takes an interest in [[British Chinese]] community issues, particularly in social reform. He is also interested in economic and cultural ties between the UK and China.&lt;ref name="Nat Wei's website"/&gt; He is the most senior ethnic Chinese politician in the European Union.

Lord Wei states "Global growth has been powered by and will continue to be boosted by Asia, particularly China and other parts of the region including increasingly South East Asia. Much of Britain and other Western countries future jobs and growth will come from engaging with the East by harnessing its investment and entering its markets.”

His focus in working with East Asia comprises now of work within the Conservative Party&lt;ref name="Conservative Friends of the Chinese"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conservativefriendsofthechinese.co.uk/ |title=Conservative Friends of the Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help engage ethnic East Asian voters and help them gain the voice, representation and participation that they need as Britain's third largest minority group.

Up to July 2015, he worked in Parliament through the All Party Parliamentary Group [[APPG]] for East Asian Business which he chaired, the All Party Parliamentary China Group&lt;ref name="All Party Parliamentary China Group"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://appcg.org.uk/ |title=All Party Parliamentary China Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which he was the vice-Chair (special focus on Hong Kong), and the All Party Parliamentary Group for Trade and Investment&lt;ref name="All Party Parliamentary Group for Trade and Investment"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trade.appg.co.uk/ |title=All Party Parliamentary Group for Trade and Investment}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which he was treasurer to promote better trade and political and cultural links between the UK and East Asia and work to encourage the next generation of East Asians and other diaspora to develop the leadership skills to play a greater role in public life, in society, and business, and in harnessing the resources that East Asians have globally and locally both financial and non-financial to address global and local problems today.These groups were discontinued after the May 2015 election. 

In 2012, [[Manchester]] local government commissioned Lord Wei to write a report on how Manchester can best engage with China. Following that Report,&lt;ref name="The Wei Report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neweconomymanchester.com/stories/1651 |title=The Wei Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Manchester-China Forum&lt;ref name="Manchester China Forum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investinmanchester.com/services/networks/manchester-china-forum/ |title=Manchester China Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established which hosts regular activities to help member businesses share information and knowledge, including seminars, meet-the-buyer events, and other networking opportunities. Lord Wei continues to work as a non-executive director of the Forum.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Jackson belongs to the Sockeye [[Tlingit clans|clan]] on the Raven side of the Chilkoot Tlingit.&lt;ref name=nea/&gt; As a young adult, he served in the military in [[Germany]], and then became involved in commercial fishing. While ill with [[pneumonia]] and unable to fish, he began to carve miniature totem poles.

Since then, Jackson's work has included large totem poles, canoes, carved doors, wood panel clan crests, masks, and jewelry. Jackson has worked to pass on traditional Tlingit carving skills to younger artists, and has offered many demonstrations and workshops in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref name=nea/&gt;

'''Nathaniel "Texas Jack" Reed''' (March 23, 1862 &amp;ndash; January 7, 1950) was a 19th-century American outlaw responsible for many stagecoach, bank, and train robberies throughout the [[American Southwest]] during the 1880s and '90s. He acted on his own and also led a bandit gang, operating particularly in the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Indian Territory]].

Reed is claimed to have been the last survivor of the ''"47 most notorious outlaws"'' of Indian Territory.&lt;ref name="County News"&gt;Haile, Bartee. [http://www.dibollfreepress.com/news/2008/0102/news/010.html "This Week in Texas: Old West relic dies in his sleep"], ''Diboll Free Press'', January 2, 2008. Accessed June 3, 2008. "Texas Jack started the new century by turning over a new leaf. Trading his sixguns for a Bible, he preached the gospel as an itinerant evangelist."&lt;/ref&gt; He became an [[Evangelism|evangelist]] in his later years, and could often be seen on the streets of Tulsa preaching against the dangers of following a "life of crime".&lt;ref name="County News"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"TEXAS JACK, 87, ONCE SOUTHWEST OUTLAW", ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 9, 1950. "The penitent badman then became an evangelist and toured the country with a wagon and team of horses"&lt;/ref&gt; His memoirs were published in the 1930s, and are considered valuable collectors' items (one copy was reportedly sold on the [[internet]] for $1,500 in 2007).&lt;ref name="Tulsa World"/&gt; He claimed to have ridden with the [[Dalton gang]], [[Bill Doolin]], [[Henry Starr]] and other outlaws and bandits of the old west. He may have also helped [[Cherokee Bill]], a fellow outlaw from the Indian Territory, in his escape from [[Fort Smith National Historic Site|Fort Smith]] during the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Tulsa World"/&gt;

As with many others of the era, Reed's colorful stories of his almost 10-year career as an outlaw were probably exaggerated by later writers.&lt;ref name="Tulsa World"/&gt; He claimed to have ridden briefly with the Daltons, and participated in their dual bank robberies in [[Coffeyville]] in 1892, as well as in the infamous 1893 [[Battle of Ingalls|gunfight at Ingalls]]. However, there is no corroborating evidence that he was involved in either of those events.&lt;ref name="Tulsa World"/&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Reed was born in [[Madison County, Arkansas]]. His father, Mason Henry Reed,  was killed in action fighting for the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], probably at the [[Battle of Campbell's Station]] on November 16, 1863.&lt;ref name="County News"/&gt; His mother was Sarah Elizabeth Prater. Reed lived with a number of relatives, including his maternal grandparents,  until 1883 when, at the age of 21, he moved to the American frontier.&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"&gt;Wilson, R. Michael. ''Great Train Robberies of the Old West''. Guilford, Connecticut: Globe Pequot, 2007. (pg. 94-101) {{ISBN|0-7627-4150-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked at various jobs in [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], [[Colorado]], [[Texas]] until he reached [[Oklahoma]], where he became a ranch hand for the Tarry outfit.&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt;

During the summer of 1885, his foreman recruited him to rob a train at [[La Junta, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="County News"/&gt; In the course of the robbery, Reed entered the passenger car firing his pistol to keep the passengers under control.&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt; He later received $6,000 for his part in the hold up.&lt;ref name="County News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt; Encouraged by this success, Reed gave up working as a cowboy and became an outlaw. During the next nine years he and his gang robbed trains, stagecoaches, banks and, on one occasion, captured a large shipment of bullion in California.&lt;ref name="Drago"&gt;Drago, Harry Sinclair. ''The Organized Bands of Bank and Train Robbers Who Terrorized the Prairie Towns of Missouri, Kansas, Indian Territory and Oklahoma for Half a Century''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1998. (pg. 195-199) {{ISBN|0-8032-6612-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robbery at Blackstone Switch===
During the early 1890s, when he was living near [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]],&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt; Reed learned that a gold shipment was leaving [[Dallas, Texas]] on November 13, 1894. He recruited [[Buz Luckey]], [[William Smith (outlaw)|William "Will" Smith]] and [[Tom Root (outlaw)|Tom Root]], and selected [[Blackstone Switch]] at [[Wybark]] as the site for the robbery. The plan was for Reed to throw the switch as the train approached then, as it entered onto a sidetrack, the gang would use dynamite to enter the express car. Root, a full-blooded Cherokee known for his size and strength, would enter the express car, break open the strong boxes, and bring out the gold. Smith would hold a gun on the engineer and fireman while Luckey stayed with the horses.&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt;

Despite their practice staged-robbery the previous day,&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt; as the ''Katy No. 2'' approached, Reed threw the switch too early. Engineer Joseph Hotchkiss stopped the train when he saw the signal light change,&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt; far short of the siding. Reed and the others were forced to run towards the train yelling and shooting. Hotchkiss and the fireman alerted the messengers using the bell cord connected to the car and jumped off the train to hide in a small ravine nearby.&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt;

The railroad company had anticipated the possibility of a robbery, and had moved the gold to another train, putting in its place several armed messengers to guard the express car including [[Bud Ledbetter]], [[Paden Tolbert]], [[Sid Johnson]], [[Frank Jones (lawman)|Frank Jones]].&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt; When Reed and the others approached the express car, he called for the messengers to leave the car. When they refused, Reed and Root took cover behind some trees and began shooting into the car. The messengers returned fire, resulting in a gunfight that lasted for nearly an hour. Eventually one of Reed's men was killed; Reed jumped onto the train and went through the passenger cars forcing passengers to put their valuables into a sack before he and his gang fled.&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt;

As they rode away, Reed was shot by Bud Ledbetter; the pain from his wound grew so severe that his partners were forced to leave him behind for the night. He gave them some of his loot, and kept the rest of it in a sack to use as a pillow.&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt; He lay on a blanket hiding under a rock ledge until he was found by an Indian woman, who nursed him back to health.&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drago"/&gt;

The [[American Express Company]] offered a reward of $250 for the arrest and conviction of each member of the gang.&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt; An extensive manhunt was conducted by [[U.S. Marshal]]s [[George Crump (lawman)|George Crump]] and [[S. Morton Rutherford]], and large groups of deputies were sent into the Indian Territory and [[Creek Nation]]. While burning the [[Sugarcane|cane]]brakes in the [[Verdigris|Verdigris bottoms]], one deputy found the burnt remains of Reed's saddle and threatened to destroy the crops of local residents if they did not turn over Reed and his men.&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt; This was considered a legal act, authorized by "The Hanging Judge" [[Isaac Parker]] himself, but no one came forward with information.&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt; Reed was warned of the search and decided to leave the territory as soon as he was able. He arrived in [[Seneca, Missouri]] on December 9, where Bill Lawrence took care of him.&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt;

Once fully recovered from his wounds Reed returned to Arkansas in February 1895, where he stayed with his brother in [[Madison County, Arkansas|Madison County]].&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt; Having decided to retire from a life of crime, he wrote to Judge Isaac Parker, agreeing to testify against the man who planned the robbery in exchange for [[probation]], although he did not participate in the proceedings.&lt;ref name="Drago"/&gt; Smith managed to disappear, but U.S. Marshal [[Newton LaForce]] was successful in tracking down Luckey and Root to the latter's home in [[Broken Arrow, Oklahoma|Broken Arrow]], 15&amp;nbsp;miles south of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The two fugitives were subsequently killed in a gunfight with LaForce and his men on December 4, 1894.&lt;ref name="Great Train Robberies"/&gt;

===Later years===
Despite Parker's promise of immunity, Reed was convicted and sentenced to serve five years in prison.&lt;ref name="Drago"/&gt; However, he served less than one, as shortly before his own death Parker granted Reed his parole, in November 1896.&lt;ref name="Drago"/&gt; Reed subsequently carried his signed parole from Judge Parker around with him, along with a letter signed by Ledbetter acknowledging that Ledbetter had shot him.&lt;ref name="Drago"/&gt;

After his release Reed became an [[Evangelism|evangelist]], preaching the rewards of living a respectable, law-abiding life.&lt;ref name="County News"/&gt; He also toured the country with a series of [[Wild West]] shows.&lt;ref name="Drago"/&gt; His memoirs, ''The Life of Texas Jack'', were published in 1936, and 35,000&amp;nbsp;copies of several published pamphlets and [[dime novels]] describing his life as an outlaw were sold before his death at home in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], at the age of 87.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} He was buried in [[St. Paul, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name="Tulsa World"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/itemsofinterest/centennial/centennial_storypage.asp?ID=070601_1_A4_spanc32475 |title=Only in Oklahoma: Outlaw left life of crime for lecture circuit |accessdate= |author=Curtis, Gene |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2007-06-01 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Tulsa World]] |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}} '''Olga FitzGeorge''' ('''Olga Mary Adelaide FitzGeorge Hamilton Lane'''; 11 June 1877 – 15 October 1928) was a British socialite, businessperson, and [[Morganatic marriage|morganatic]] descendant of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] through her grandfather, [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]]. FitzGeorge was the only daughter and child of [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear Admiral]] [[Adolphus FitzGeorge|Sir Adolphus FitzGeorge]] and his wife Sophia Jane Holden FitzGeorge.

Born in [[Athens]] while her father was serving with the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], FitzGeorge was a goddaughter of [[Olga Constantinovna of Russia|Queen Olga of Greece]] and her great aunt [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck]]. During her childhood, FitzGeorge's parents allowed her to perform in plays for charitable events despite the misgivings of her great-grandmother [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel|Augusta, Duchess of Cambridge]], and her grandfather, the Duke of Cambridge.

FitzGeorge was married first to Charles Edward ''Archibald'' Watkin Hamilton (later [[Sir Archibald Hamilton, 5th Baronet]]) in 1897. FitzGeorge was known for her lavish lifestyle, and she continued her extravagant behavior throughout the course of this marriage, which increased her husband's debts and caused marital strife when Hamilton attempted to limit her expenditures. In order to achieve financial independence, FitzGeorge established a [[manicure]] and beauty salon on [[Bond Street|New Bond Street]] in London despite its annoyance to both the Hamilton family and the [[British royal family]]. FitzGeorge's first marriage, which ended in a highly-publicized divorce in 1902, produced two children: a son, [[George FitzGeorge Hamilton|''George'' Edward Archibald Augustus FitzGeorge Hamilton]], in 1898 and an unnamed daughter who died shortly after her birth. FitzGeorge's son died in 1918 while serving with the [[Grenadier Guards]] in France during [[World War I]].

FitzGeorge married lawyer Robert Charlton Lane in 1905, and the couple had a daughter, Mary Alice Olga Sofia ''Jane'' Lane Hohler Scrivener, in 1919. In 1908 FitzGeorge made headlines for her alleged affair with Arthur Clark Kennedy and was named in his divorce proceedings with his second wife. FitzGeorge died of an [[embolism]] at age 51 in [[Rouen]], France, in 1928 and was interred at her Glebe Manor estate in [[Warblington]], [[Hampshire]]. In her will, she bequeathed £1,000 to [[Winchester College]] for the establishment of the George FitzGeorge Hamilton Fund to assist in the education of the children of Wykehamists who died in World War{{nbsp}}I. FitzGeorge's daughter Jane, who later married British ambassador Ronald Stratford Scrivener, died in 2014.

Through her father, FitzGeorge was a granddaughter of [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]] (1819–1904), [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]] from 1856 to 1895, and his wife [[Sarah Fairbrother]] (1816–1890).&lt;ref name = "The Manchester Guardian 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Stock 1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stock|1904|p=6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because her paternal grandparents' marriage was in contravention to the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772|Royal Marriages Act of 1772]], FitzGeorge's father and her uncles [[Colonel]] [[George FitzGeorge]] (1843–1907) and Colonel Sir Augustus FitzGeorge (1847–1933) were ineligible to inherit the [[Duke of Cambridge|Dukedom of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name = "Washington Post 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Stock 2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stock|1904|pp=6-7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also through her father, FitzGeorge was a male-line descendant of [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge]] (1774–1850) and [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] (1738–1820).&lt;ref name = "Stock 3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stock|1904|pp=5-6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a descendant of George{{nbsp}}III, FitzGeorge was also a [[cousin|first cousin twice-removed]] of [[Queen Victoria]] (1819–1901) and a first cousin once-removed of [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] (1867–1953), who was the daughter of her godmother the Duchess of Teck.

== Childhood and adolescence ==
As a child, FitzGeorge's parents allowed her to perform in plays and musicals for the benefit of charitable causes. In June 1882 she and her father performed in three plays at the Corn Exchange in [[Newark-on-Trent]] to raise funds for the construction of a local hospital there.&lt;ref name = "Scott 1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Scott|1882|p=126.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FitzGeorge's grandfather, the Duke of Cambridge, was urged by his mother [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel|Augusta, Duchess of Cambridge]], to interfere in FitzGeorge's upbringing by her parents, and discouraged them from allowing her to participate in performances and public events.&lt;ref name = "St. Aubyn 1"&gt;{{Harvnb|St. Aubyn|1963|p=279.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884 the Duke worried about FitzGeorge's presence at a charity bazaar hosted by her mother at [[St James's Palace]], despite it being patronized by [[Edward VII|Albert Edward, Prince of Wales]], and his wife [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra, Princess of Wales]].&lt;ref name = "St. Aubyn 1"/&gt; The Duke wrote to FitzGeorge's father on 15 July 1884, insisting that she should be "quietly dressed" at the bazaar and that "appearing on the stage is not desirable for this nice little girl".&lt;ref name = "St. Aubyn 1"/&gt;

In 1886 Olga served as a bridesmaid at the wedding of her maternal aunt Hélène Cecil Holden to John Louis Mitchell.&lt;ref name = "Duff 1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Duff|1938|p=275.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also attended a state ball hosted by Queen Victoria at [[Buckingham Palace]] in May 1895.&lt;ref name="The Times 1"&gt;{{cite news | title = State Ball. | newspaper = [[The Times]] | publication-place = London | date = 30 May 1895 | page = 10 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/image/32647386/ | accessdate = 13 November 2017 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041903/https://www.newspapers.com/image/32647386/ | archivedate = 1 December 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to his desertion, FitzGeorge filed for and was granted a decree of [[restitution of conjugal rights]] by [[Francis Jeune, 1st Baron St Helier|Sir Francis Jeune]] in a divorce court on 28 July 1902.&lt;ref name = "Washington Post 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "The National Archives 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "The New Zealand Herald 1"/&gt; FitzGeorge was also granted custody of their son, George.&lt;ref name = "The New Zealand Herald 1"/&gt; Despite efforts by the royal family to reconcile FitzGeorge with her husband, she filed a petition for divorce from Hamilton.&lt;ref name = "Washington Post 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Washington Post 2"/&gt; FitzGeorge was granted a divorce from Hamilton on 3 November 1902&lt;ref name = "The National Archives 2"/&gt; on the grounds that her husband had abandoned FitzGeorge and engaged in extramarital misconduct with an unknown woman.&lt;ref name = "McNaughton 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Washington Post 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun 1"&gt;{{cite news | title = Mrs. Hamilton Divorced | newspaper = [[The Baltimore Sun]] | publication-place = Baltimore | date = 4 November 1902 | page = 9 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/image/214593000/ | accessdate = 18 November 2017 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035410/https://www.newspapers.com/image/214593000/ | archivedate = 1 December 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of their wedding guests were present in the courtroom for their divorce ruling.&lt;ref name="Pittston Gazette 1"&gt;{{cite news | title = Royalty in the Divorce Court. | newspaper = Pittston Gazette | publication-place = [[Pittston, Pennsylvania]] | date = 4 November 1902 | page = 1 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/image/51596594/ | accessdate = 18 November 2017 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032701/https://www.newspapers.com/image/51596594/ | archivedate = 1 December 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second marriage ==
Three years later, FitzGeorge married lawyer Robert Charlton Lane (26 January 1873{{snd}}23 May 1943), son of Charles Thomas Lane, on 5 January 1905 in London.&lt;ref name = "Washington Post 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "McNaughton 2"&gt;{{Harvnb|McNaughton|1973|p=527.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their marriage, FitzGeorge frequently traveled to New York.&lt;ref name = "Washington Post 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Washington Post 2"/&gt; FitzGeorge and Lane had a residence at 1{{nbsp}}South Eaton Place in Belgravia and an estate named Glebe Manor in [[Warblington]] near [[Havant]] in [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref name = "The London Gazette 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Manchester Guardian 2"&gt;{{cite news | title = Recent Wills. | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | publication-place = Manchester | date = 15 February 1929 | page = 7 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/image/258569698/ | accessdate = 18 November 2017 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171203131210/https://www.newspapers.com/image/258569698/ | archivedate = 3 December 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1908 FitzGeorge became involved in a divorce proceeding in [[Edinburgh]] between Arthur Clark Kennedy and his second wife, partly due to FitzGeorge's alleged relationship with Kennedy.&lt;ref name = "Washington Post 6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Weekly Mail 1"&gt;{{cite news | title = Smart Divorce Case. | newspaper = [[The Weekly Mail]] | publication-place = Cardiff | date = 1 February 1908 | page = 3 | url = http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3378682/3378685/68/ | accessdate = 20 November 2017 | via = [[National Library of Wales]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171201044549/http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3378682/3378685/68/ | archivedate = 1 December 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's wife claimed that FitzGeorge and Kennedy had traveled together to cities in Great Britain, Ireland, and France in 1906, and resided together in [[Bury St Edmunds]] in March and April of that year.&lt;ref name = "The Weekly Mail 1"/&gt; FitzGeorge's own mother wrote a letter of sympathy to Kennedy's wife in which she stated, "I find we have no power to stop Olga's money. We cannot stop anybody doing anything, but can only pray for the best. Take care of yourself."&lt;ref name = "Washington Post 6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "The Weekly Mail 1"/&gt; Kennedy was not present for the divorce proceeding, and his wife was ultimately granted a divorce.&lt;ref name = "Washington Post 6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "The Weekly Mail 1"/&gt; Throughout the trial, FitzGeorge vacationed in [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name = "Washington Post 6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "The Weekly Mail 1"/&gt;

In 1916, during [[World War I]], FitzGeorge's son George entered the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], and in late 1917 he obtained a commission as a [[Second lieutenant]] in the [[British Army]]'s [[Grenadier Guards]], in which his great-grandfather the Duke of Cambridge had served.&lt;ref name = "Selsey57 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Winchester College 1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Winchester College|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few months later, on 18 May 1918, George was killed by a bomb from an airplane at Warlincourt near [[Arras]], France.&lt;ref name = "Washington Post 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Selsey57 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Winchester College 1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Winchester College|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[burial|interred]] at Warlincourt Halte British Cemetery near [[Saulty]].&lt;ref name = "Selsey57 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Winchester College 1"/&gt;

Following the war, FitzGeorge and Lane became the parents of a daughter, Mary Alice Olga Sofia ''Jane'' Lane (4 June 1919{{snd}}20 September 2014).&lt;ref name = "McNaughton 3"&gt;{{Harvnb|McNaughton|1973|p=523.}}&lt;/ref&gt; FitzGeorge's mother Sophia died on 3 February 1920.

[[Image:Otto Marseus van Schrieck 001.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Morning glory]], [[toad]], and [[insect]]s'', 1660]]

'''Otto Marseus van Schrieck''' (ca. 1613, in [[Nijmegen]] &amp;ndash; buried 22 June 1678, in [[Amsterdam]]) was a painter in the [[Dutch Golden Age]]. He is best known for his paintings of forest [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]].

==Biography==
Marseus van Schrieck spent the years 1652-1657 in [[Rome]] and [[Florence]] with the painters [[Matthias Withoos]] and [[Willem van Aelst]], and there joined the Dutch Guild of Artists. Later he worked at the court of the Grand Duke of Tuscany and traveled throughout England and France, after which he settled in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="Caldwell"/&gt; On 25 April 1664, he married Margarita Gysels (the daughter of Cornelius Gysels, an engraver).&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;{{Citation|last = Caldwell|first = Joan|contribution = Otto Marseus van Schrieck|year = 1995|title = Handbook of the Collection of New Orleans Museum of Art|editor-last = Bullard|editor-first = E. John|pages = 41|place = New Orleans|publisher = New Orleans Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Houbraken]]'s biography of Otto mentions that he joined the [[Bentvueghels]] in Rome and was called the ''snuffelaer'', or "sniffer", because he was always sniffing strange lizards and snakes.{{Clarify|date=August 2018}}  Houbraken quotes Otto's wife, who survived him by two husbands and was still alive when he wrote the book; according to her, Otto kept snakes and lizards in a shed at the back of his house, and also on a piece of land outside the city that was walled in for this purpose.

'''Puan Maharani''' (born September 6, 1973) is an Indonesian politician serving as the [[Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Cultural Affairs (Indonesia)|Coordinating Minister for Human Development and Cultural Affairs]] in [[Joko Widodo]]'s [[Working Cabinet (Joko Widodo)|Working Cabinet]] since 2014. She is a member of [[Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle|PDI-P]], the largest party in the Indonesian parliament and the party of the president.

A member of the [[People's Representative Council]] since her [[Indonesian legislative election, 2009|election in 2009]], she served as head of her party's faction from 2012 until being appointed to cabinet in 2014. She was one of eight women appointed as ministers and the only coordinating minister to be female.

She is the youngest child and the only daughter of former president and current PDI-P leader [[Megawati Soekarnoputri]], and a granddaughter of Indonesia's founding president [[Sukarno]]. Her father, [[Taufiq Kiemas]], served as the Speaker of the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] from 2009 until his death in 2013.

==Family and personal life==
===Early life===
In 1970, Megawati's first husband Surindro Supjarso - with whom she had two sons - died when his [[Short SC.7 Skyvan]] crashed near [[Biak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://majalah.tempo.co/konten/1971/03/06/PT/56803/Mega-Ditinggal-Suami/01/01|title=Mega Ditinggal Suami
|publisher=Tempo|accessdate=7 November 2017|language=id|date=6 March 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief marriage to an Egyptian diplomat, Megawati married [[Taufiq Kiemas]] and Maharani was born in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamb|first1=David|title=Megawati Rises Above Stormy Clouds of Suharto Era|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/23/news/mn-25346|accessdate=22 March 2018|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=23 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; After founding president [[Sukarno]] was overthrown by [[Suharto]] following the [[30 September Movement]] of 1965, Kiemas spent several years in jail as a political prisoner, limiting the family's economic and social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mengintip Kisah Cinta Taufiq Kiemas dan Megawati Soekarnoputri|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/2134527/mengintip-kisah-cinta-taufiq-kiemas-dan-megawati-soekarnoputri|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=Detik|date=7 January 2013|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Her first 12 years of schooling was completed in [[Cikini, Menteng|Cikini]], and she entered the [[University of Indonesia]] in 1991 to study [[mass communication]]. She graduated in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sosok Puan Maharani, Salah Satu Menteri Koordinator di Kabinet Jokowi|url=http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2014/10/26/18263291/Sosok.Puan.Maharani.Salah.Satu.Menteri.Koordinator.di.Kabinet.Jokowi|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=KOMPAS.com|date=26 October 2014|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Puan is married to businessman Hapsoro 'Happy' Sukmonohadi and they have two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profil Puan Maharani|url=http://www.viva.co.id/siapa/read/231-puan-maharani|publisher=VIVA.co.id|accessdate=7 November 2017|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After the [[fall of Suharto]] in 1998, Puan became involved in politics as her mother was one of the main players in the national political scene. During the three-year [[Megawati Sukarnoputri#Presidency|Megawati presidency]], she would often accompany her mother on domestic and foreign official visits, in addition to conducting social events by herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Puan Maharani|url=https://profil.merdeka.com/indonesia/p/puan-maharani/|publisher=Merdeka|accessdate=7 November 2017|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Megawati introduced Puan, then head of PDI-P's public and women's empowerment wing, as her successor during campaigning for the [[East Java]] 2008 gubernatorial elections in [[Ngawi Regency|Ngawi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Megawati Perkenalkan Penerusnya Puan Maharani|url=http://www.antaranews.com/berita/109431/megawati-perkenalkan-penerusnya-puan-maharani|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=[[ANTARA]]|date=16 July 2008|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that, Maharani ran in the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2009|2009 elections]] in [[Central Java]]'s election district 5 (covering [[Surakarta]], [[Sukoharjo Regency|Sukoharjo]], [[Klaten Regency|Klaten]] and [[Boyolali Regency|Boyolali]]) and won 242,504 votes - the second highest of all parliamentary candidates in the nation.&lt;ref name="tempo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Puan Maharani, Calon Menko Pembangunan Manusia|url=https://nasional.tempo.co/read/616328/puan-maharani-calon-menko-pembangunan-manusia|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=Tempo|date=22 October 2014|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her first term, she acted as head of the PDI-P faction since 2012, replacing [[Tjahjo Kumolo]] (who later became [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Indonesia)|Minister of Home Affairs]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Puan Gantikan Tjahjo sebagai Ketua Fraksi PDIP|url=https://nasional.tempo.co/read/379104/puan-gantikan-tjahjo-sebagai-ketua-fraksi-pdip|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=Tempo|date=23 January 2012|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was assigned to the [[People's Representative Council|DPR]]'s 6th commission, covering investment and [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SME]]s.&lt;ref name="tempo"/&gt; During this period, she argued against a fuel price hike policy in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tolak Kenaikan BBM, Puan: Program Balsem Tak Jelas|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/2275354/tolak-kenaikan-bbm-puan-program-balsem-tak-jelas|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=detik.com|language=id|date=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, she was briefly put up as a possible PDI-P presidential candidate for the [[Indonesian presidential election, 2014|2014 elections]] and as a possible vice presidential candidate to [[Joko Widodo]] (popularly known as Jokowi). In the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2014|legislative elections]], she won 326,927 votes, once more scoring the second-most votes nationwide.&lt;ref name="tempo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Puan still eyes VP position|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/05/17/puan-still-eyes-vp-position.html|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|date=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Jokowi's election victory over [[Prabowo Subianto]], she was appointed a cabinet minister amid criticism over her inexperience and her mother's political influence.&lt;ref name="tempo"/&gt; Her replacement in parliament, Alfia Reziani, was only sworn in by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ihsanuddin|title=Alfia Reziani Resmi Dilantik Jadi Anggota DPR Gantikan Puan Maharani|url=http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2016/03/17/16540971/Alfia.Reziani.Resmi.Dilantik.Jadi.Anggota.DPR.Gantikan.Puan.Maharani|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=KOMPAS.com|date=17 March 2016|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed success during her tenure, pointing at the rising [[Human Development Index|HDI]] in addition to lower poverty and [[Gini ratio]] statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt announces progress in human development, cultural affairs|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/adv/2017/10/27/govt-announces-progress-in-human-development-cultural-affairs.html|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|date=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption allegation==
On 22 March 2018, former House of Representatives speaker [[Setya Novanto]], while on trial for corruption, testified Puan received a bribe of $500,000 from businessman Made Oka in connection with an electronic identity card program when she was a legislator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kharishar|first1=Khafi|title=Setya testifies that Puan, Pramono received e-ID graft money|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/03/22/setya-testifies-that-puan-pramono-received-e-id-graft-money.html|accessdate=22 March 2018|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puan admitted to knowing Made Oka but denied discussing the e-ID case with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Puan denies Setya's claim she received e-ID money|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/03/24/puan-denies-setyas-claim-she-received-e-id-money.html|accessdate=25 March 2018|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baldwin VI of Flanders and Richilde of Hainault.jpg|thumb|150px|Baldwin VI of Flanders and Richilde of Hainault]]
'''Richilde, Countess of Mons and Hainaut''' ({{circa|1018}} – 15 March 1086), was a ruling countess of Hainaut from c. 1050 until 1076, in co-regency with her husband [[Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders]] and son [[Baldwin II, Count of Hainaut]]. She was also countess consort of Flanders by marriage to [[Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders]]. She served as regent of Flanders during the minority of her son [[Arnulf III, Count of Flanders]] in 1070-1071. 

==Life==
Richilde is most likely a daugher of Reinier of Hasnon (died c.1049) and Adelheid of Egisheim.  &lt;ref&gt; Van Droogenbroeck, F. J., [https://www.academia.edu/35663101/ "De markenruil Ename – Valenciennes en de investituur van de graaf van Vlaanderen in de mark Ename",  ''Handelingen van de Geschied- en Oudheidkundige Kring van Oudenaarde'' 55 (2018) 47-127]&lt;/ref&gt; 
She was born c. 1018.&lt;ref name="CAR115"&gt;Karen S. Nicholas, 'Countesses as Rulers in Flanders', ''Aristocratic Women in Medieval France'', Ed. Theodore Evergates (Philadelphia : University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1040, she married [[Herman, Count of Hainaut|Herman of Mons]], who became [[Counts of Hainaut|Count of Hainaut]].&lt;ref name="CAR115"/&gt; 

==="Heiress of Hainaut"===
For a long time, Richilde's own rights and position were not well understood.  She is counted as ruling countess of Hainaut for different periods in different sources.  In a first phase, she followed in the marche of Valenciennes c.1049 as only heir of her father, Reinier of Hasnon, who was installed in 1047 as margrave of Valenciennes to replace [[Baldwin V, Count of Flanders|Baldwin V of Flanders]] (who rebelled against the Empire and lost his fiefs). Her first husband, Herman of Mons, count of Hainaut, died c.1050/1051, and left Richilde in the position of "heiress of Hainaut".  As such,she was actually Countess regnant in her own right in Valenciennes and in her husband's rights in Hainaut. 

Her position as "heiress of Hainaut", made her an attractive bride, but this placed the County in a dangerous position.  She was forced by [[Baldwin V, Count of Flanders|Baldwin V of Flanders]] to marry his eldest son [[Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders|Baldwin]].  It was indeed her future father-in-law Baldwin V who, under threat of force, arranged the marriage between his son and Richilde.&lt;ref&gt;Renée Nip, 'The Political Relations Between England and Flanders (1066–1128)', ''Anglo-Norman Studies 21: Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1998'', Ed. Christopher Harper-Bill (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 1989), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;  

As Hainaut and Valenciennes were empirial fiefs and [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] had not been consulted, the marriage resulted in a war between the emperor and the Baldwin's, ending in a total defeat of the latter in 1054. &lt;ref&gt;Renée Nip, 'The Political Relations Between England and Flanders (1066–1128)', ''Anglo-Norman Studies 21: Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1998'', Ed. Christopher Harper-Bill (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 1989), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESII5"&gt;Detlev Schwennicke, ''Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten'', Neue Folge, Band II (Marburg, Germany: Verlag von J. A. Stargardt, 1984), Tafle 5&lt;/ref&gt;  

Her husband Baldwin became ruling count of Hainaut ''[[De jure uxoris]]''. Her father-in-law also arranged to disinherite the two children she had with Herman, Hainaut and Valenciennes being inherited by the count of Flanders. 

Baldwin VI followed as count of Flanders in 1067, unifying as such Hainaut, Valenciennes and Flanders, and ruled until his death (17 July 1070).

===Regency of Flanders===
Baldwin VI left Flanders to their eldest son, Arnulf III, and the [[County of Hainaut]] to the younger son, [[Baldwin II, Count of Hainaut|Baldwin II]], with the provision that if either son preceded the other in death, he would inherit the other's county as well.&lt;ref name="COH5"&gt;Gilbert of Mons, ''Chronicle of Hainaut'', Trans.  Laura Napran (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2005), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin VI also obtained assurances from his brother [[Robert I, Count of Flanders|Robert]] who gave his oath of homage and promised to protect his nephew.&lt;ref name="COH5"/&gt; After Baldwin VI's death their son Arnulf III became Count of Flanders, but as he was a minor, Richilde served as [[Regent]] of Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;Renée Nip, 'The Political Relations between England and Flanders (1066–1128)', ''Anglo-Norman Studies 21: Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1998'', Ed. Christopher Harper-Bill (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 1999), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately Arnulf's uncle, [[Robert I, Count of Flanders|Robert the Frisian]], broke his oath to his brother Baldwin VI and disputed Arnulf's right to Flanders.&lt;ref name="TCHD114"&gt;Jim Bradbury, ''The Capetians: The History of a Dynasty (987–1328)'' (London &amp; New York: Hambledon Continuum, 2007), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Richilde asked for help from [[William Fitzosbern]] of Normandy who married her. Despite help from King [[Philip I of France]], her forces were defeated at the [[Battle of Cassel (1071)|Battle of Cassel]] and [[William Fitzosbern]] was killed along with her oldest son, Arnulf.  Richilde herself was captured and released,&lt;ref&gt;Karen S. Nicholas, 'Countesses as Rulers in Flanders', ''Aristocratic Women in Medieval France'', Ed. Theodore Evergates (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; King Philip later recognized Robert as Count of Flanders.&lt;ref name="COH6"&gt;Gilbert of Mons, ''Chronicle of Hainaut'', Trans.  Laura Napran (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2005), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later reign===
Richilde and her younger son, [[Baldwin II, Count of Hainaut|Baldwin II]], retained Hainaut, but made subsequent unsuccessful attempts to recover Flanders.&lt;ref name="COH6"/&gt; Richilde built the castle at [[Beaumont, Belgium|Beaumont]] along with a chapel there dedicated to [[Venantius Fortunatus|St. Venantius]].&lt;ref name="CAR116"&gt;Karen S. Nicholas, 'Countesses as Rulers in Flanders', ''Aristocratic Women in Medieval France'', Ed. Theodore Evergates (Philadelphia : University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; She, along with her son Baldwin, founded the monastery of [[Saint-Denis (Mons)|Saint-Denis-en-Broqueroie]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert of Mons, ''Chronicle of Hainaut'', Trans. Laura Napran (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2005), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the end of her regency she retired to the [[Mesen|Abbey of Messines]].&lt;ref name="CAR116"/&gt;  In 1076, she was evidently deposed by her son. 

Richilde died on 15 March 1086.&lt;ref&gt;George Edward Cokayne, ''The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant'', Vol. VI, Ed. H. A. Doubleday &amp; Howard de Walden (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1926), p. 449&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Richilde married [[Herman, Count of Hainaut]]. They had two children:
* Roger (d. 1093) who was apparently lame, became Bishop of [[Châlons-sur-Marne]].&lt;ref name="COH3-8"&gt;Gilbert of Mons, ''Chronicle of Hainaut'', Trans. Laura Napran (Woodbridge, The Boydell Press, 2005), pp. 3 &amp; n. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
* Daughter, whose name is unknown.&lt;ref name="COH3-8"/&gt;

Richilde married secondly [[Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders]]. They were the parents of:
* [[Arnulf III, Count of Flanders]] (c. 1055 – 22 February 1071).&lt;ref name="ESII5"/&gt;
* [[Baldwin II, Count of Hainaut]] (c. 1056 – 1098).&lt;ref name="ESII5"/&gt;

In 1071 Richilde married thirdly [[William Fitzosbern, 1st Earl of Hereford]] (c. 1025 – 1071).&lt;ref name="ESII5"/&gt;

[[Robert Rodriguez|Robert Anthony Rodríguez]] is an American film director, film producer, writer, composer, cinematographer and film editor.  He has contributed to many projects as a combination of the six. Less commonly, Rodriguez has also worked as a second unit director, animator and a visual effects supervisor.

Despite being rejected from the [[University of Texas]]' film school due to poor academic promise of the Arts, Robert Rodriguez created his first [[16 mm film|16mm]] short film ''[[Bedhead (film)|Bedhead]]'' which opened many doors for him. Rodriguez then created his first feature-length film ''[[El Mariachi]]'' which was picked up by [[Columbia Pictures]]. After directing the television film ''Road Racers'', Rodriguez continued work in Hollywood.

''El Mariachi'', was the first of Rodriguez ''Mexico Trilogy'' that included ''Desperado'' and ''Once Upon a Time in Mexico''. Rodriguez continued working on several other film series including the [[crime film|crime]]-[[horror film]] hybrid ''From Dusk Till Dawn'' and the [[family film|family-oriented]] [[adventure film]] series ''Spy Kids''. Rodriguez has also collaborated with film director [[Quentin Tarantino]] on various projects including ''Four Rooms'', ''From Dusk Til Dawn'', ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 2]]'', ''Sin City'' and ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''.

'''Rubén Martínez Bulnes''' ([[San Salvador]], July 7, 1929) is a [[Salvadorans|Salvadoran]] architect and sculptor. He is considered the author of the country's most prolific sculptural art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idArt=2836692&amp;idCat=6329 Escultura tributo a Rubén Martínez]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
His interest in art began in his infancy. As a young person he wanted to become an architect, but he ended up studying civil engineering like his father.&lt;ref name="faro"&gt;El Faro: [http://www.elfaro.net/es/200910/platicas/323/ Plática con Rubén Martínez]&lt;/ref&gt; His career as a sculptor began when he collected metallic remains from the place where he studied. He received his first instruction from welders.

== Career ==
The predominant material in his creations are [[metal]]s and [[Forging|forged]] iron,&lt;ref name="marte"&gt;MARTE: [http://artistadelmes.com.sv/ruben-martinez/ Rubén Martínez]&lt;/ref&gt; which are sculpted in a range of abstract forms. Important pieces of the Salvadoran nation were made by him, among them the Monument of the Constitution ({{Lang-es|link=no|Monumento a la Constitución}}), the Monument of Peace ({{Lang-es|link=no|Monumento a la Paz}}), and the sculptures of José Simeón Cañas, exhibited in the national Museum of art, and [[José Matías Delgado]], located in the parque San José in [[San Salvador]].&lt;ref name="asamblea"&gt;[http://www.asamblea.gob.sv/noticias/archivo-de-noticias/declaran-201cnotable-escultor-de-el-salvador201d-al-arquitecto-ruben-martinez-bulnes Declaran “Notable Escultor de El Salvador” al Arquitecto Rubén Martínez Bulnes]&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked in gardening, painting, drawing, [[landscaping]], [[Glass working|glass work]], [[Restoration (cultural heritage)|restoration]] and music.

His most important architectural work is the Iglesia El Rosario, located in the Historical Center of San Salvador. The church is in a modernist style with a European influence.&lt;ref&gt;El Diario de Hoy: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090531083810/http://www.elsalvador.com/hablemos/2005/200205/200205-3.htm Iglesia El Rosario Diseño Único]&lt;/ref&gt; Inside are some of his iron sculptures and glass work, as well as a symmetrical form which has no pillars so as to not create obstacles for the altar.&lt;ref&gt;El Diario de Hoy: [http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=6482&amp;idArt=4291467 El legado religioso de Rubén Martínez]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite criticism for the structure's design, he received support from the [[Dominican order|Dominicans]] who were in charge of the church. Other examples of his religious works are the templos del Perpetuo Socorro, la Transfiguración and San José de la Montaña.

== Recognition ==
In November 2012 he was recognized as Notable sculptor of El Salvador by the [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador|Legislative Assembly]].

In April 2018 he was named Merited Son of San Salvador ({{Lang-es|link=no|Hijo Meritísimo de San Salvador}}) by the Alcaldía of San Salvador in honor of his work.

He was the commander-in-chief of the Qing fleets which destroyed the power of [[Koxinga|Zheng Chenggong]]'s descendants in the 1660s, and led the conquest of the Zheng family's [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in [[Taiwan]] in 1683. Shi later governed part of Taiwan as a marquis.

==Early life and career==
Shi Lang was born to a distinguished lineage in [[Jinjiang, Fujian]], in 1621. He studied military strategy in his youth, and became particularly proficient in naval warfare. After fighting a number of minor operations locally with his father, he joined [[Zheng Zhilong]]'s naval fleet as captain of the left vanguard. Shi Lang served most of the early 1640s in the Zheng family's fleet, where he apparently saw some conflict with Zheng Zhilong's son [[Koxinga|Zheng Chenggong]]. When Shi defected to the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1646, Zheng Chenggong killed Shi's father, brother and son.

==Campaign against the Zheng family==
The Qing rulers prized Shi Lang for his extensive naval experience and his network of contacts in the major trading ports of [[East Asia]]. He accompanied Prince Jidu (son of [[Jirgalang]]) on an expedition in [[Fujian]] in 1656, and attained the rank of Assistant Brigadier-General. In the campaign of 1663 against the Zheng family, he commanded Dutch ships and men to follow up the Qing victories.&lt;ref name="Macgowan1906"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Macgowan|title=The Imperial History of China: Being a History of the Empire as Compiled by the Chinese Historians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rG8DAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA528&amp;lpg=PA528&amp;dq=Shi+Lang+was+known+for+his+attitude+and+refusal+to+obey+orders.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pi1GuTUrzR&amp;sig=5KaRXv1-ehkG4m2yIiuJuQbVrJQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiusJm6gpXbAhUBwFkKHXKjAdMQ6AEIQzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Shi%20Lang%20was%20known%20for%20his%20attitude%20and%20refusal%20to%20obey%20orders.&amp;f=false|year=1906|publisher=American Presbyterian Mission Press|pages=528–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1668, he submitted a plan to drive the remnants of the Ming dynasty from [[Taiwan]] and the Pescadores ([[Penghu]]), but the proposal was not utilised. He was given a post in the Imperial Bodyguard and attached to the Chinese [[Eight Banners|Bordered Yellow Banner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/06dat/bio.1imp.html Imperial China- (?- 1644)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conquest of Taiwan==
{{main|Battle of Penghu}}

In 1681, following the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], the [[Kangxi Emperor]] sought a possible leader for an amphibious operation against Taiwan. Following the advice of [[Li Guangdi]], he chose Shi Lang. Shi Lang insisted on having an independent command, not one shared with [[Yao Qisheng]], the Governor-General of Fujian. On 8 July 1683, after extensive preparation, Shi Lang led a force of 300 warships and 20,000 soldiers out of Tongshan, Fujian. On July 16–17, he defeated the Zheng family's leading naval commander, [[Liu Guoxuan]], in a major engagement near the Pescadores.&lt;ref name="Dittmer2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lowell Dittmer|title=Taiwan and China: Fitful Embrace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqc0DwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Zheng+Chouyu+koxinga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7qP_espXbAhUqw1kKHT1nBvkQ6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=koxinga&amp;f=false|date=26 September 2017|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-29598-8|pages=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 September, Shi Lang received [[Zheng Keshuang]]'s offer to surrender. On 3 October, he reached Taiwan and formally obtained the capitulation of Liu Guoxuan and Zheng Keshuang.

Following this successful campaign, Shi Lang returned to the Chinese mainland and worked hard to persuade the Kangxi Emperor to make Taiwan part of China's recognized territory. At the time, there was opposition among many within the Qing government toward the annexation of Taiwan, arguing that its maintenance would become an economic burden on the empire. However, the Kangxi Emperor accepted Shi Lang's views, and in 1684 Taiwan was divided into three counties and established as a prefecture of Fujian province.

Shi Lang was declared the "General Who Maintains Peace on the Seas" (靖海将军) and given the hereditary rank of [[marquis]].&lt;ref name="BrunnertHagelstrom2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=H.S. Brunnert|author2=V.V.

Shi Lang continued at his post in Fujian, seizing almost half of the developed land in southern Taiwan for his own profit. Shi annually extorted monetary resources from rich and poor local communities alike, and instituted policies that deliberately aimed to isolate Taiwan from the rest of the Qing Empire &amp;ndash; coastal provinces were forbidden to interact with Taiwan, and even people from inland provinces were disallowed to bring their families with them, effectively preventing them from making any permanent foothold in Taiwan. Although he was later charged with arrogance, in 1688 the Kangxi Emperor received Shi Lang in audience in [[Beijing]] and allowed him to sit in the imperial presence, reiterating his confidence in him. Shi Lang returned to Fujian and remained in office there until his death in 1696.

==Legacy==
Shi Lang was given the posthumous name "Xiangzhuang" (襄壮), and the title of [[Government of the Han Dynasty#Staffs of the heir apparent.2C empress.2C and harems|Junior Tutor to the Heir Apparent]]. In 1732, his name was entered for worship in the Temple of Eminent Statesmen. One of his sons achieved distinction as an admiral, whilst another was a state official. The Shi family was granted the special privilege of burial in their ancestral cemetery in [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang]], instead of in Banner lands as was the case with other Bannermen.

Though famous for his military achievements, Shi Lang remains a controversial figure in contemporary China. He is generally denounced as a traitorous figure who abandoned the Ming loyalist cause for the Qing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Leong|editor1-first=Stephen|title=Asia Pacific Security: Imperatives for Co-operation: Papers Presented at the 19th Asia-Pacific Roundtable: 31 May-3 June, 2005, Kuala Lumpur|date=2006|publisher=ISIS Malaysia|location=Kuala Lumpur|isbn=9789679472912|page=154|quote=Shih Lang had fallen out with the Cheng family in 1662 and offered his services to the new Manchu rulers — he was therefore regarded as something of a traitor to the Ming cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=Young-tsu|title=Security and Warfare on the China Coast: The Taiwan Question in the Seventeenth Century|journal=Monumenta Serica|date=27 April 2016|volume=35|issue=1|page=113|doi=10.1080/02549948.1981.11731152|quote=Strangely enough he has been vilified as a traitor by the modern Chinese. To be sure, Shih betrayed Cheng Ch'eng-kung and the cause of the Ming loyalist movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a defector, his exploits have generally been downplayed by the governments of both Taiwan and China, and he is remembered in Taiwan as a conqueror and cruel governor.

==In popular culture==
In ''[[The Deer and the Cauldron]]'', a 1969 ''[[wuxia]]'' novel by [[Jin Yong|Louis Cha]], Shi Lang is appointed by the Kangxi Emperor to help the protagonist [[Wei Xiaobao]] to bombard the Mystic Dragon Cult. Shi Lang succeeds in the mission, but Wei Xiaobao is captured during the battle by Hong Antong &amp;ndash; the leader of the cult &amp;ndash; and taken to Russia. Shi Lang's capture of Taiwan is also briefly described in later chapters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7340">'''Stanley Phillips "Stan" Frankel''' (1919 – May, 1978) was an [[United States|American]] computer scientist.  He was born in [[Los Angeles]], attended graduate school at the [[University of Rochester]], received his PhD in physics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]],&lt;ref&gt;''Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project'', edited by Cynthia C. Kelly, World Scientific Publishing, 2006, {{ISBN|981-256-418-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began his career as a post-doc student under [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1942. Frankel helped develop computational techniques used in the nuclear research taking place at the time, notably making some of the early calculations relating to the diffusion of neutrons in a critical assembly of uranium with Eldred Nelson.&lt;ref name="LANLhist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seidel|first1=Robert W.|title=Evolving From Calculators to Computers|url=https://library.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/getfile?9-24-93.html|website=LANL Research Library|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory History Publications|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the T (Theoretical) Division of the [[Manhattan Project]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] in 1943. His wife Mary was also hired to work as a [[human computer]] in the T Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howes|first1=Ruth H.|last2=Herzenberg|first2=Caroline L.|title=Their Day in the Sun: Women of the Manhattan Project|date=2003|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=9781592131921|pages=99-100}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Los Alamos, Frankel and Nelson organized a group of scientists' wives, including Mary, to [[human computer|perform some of the repetitive calculations]] using [[Marchant calculator|Marchant]] and [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] desk calculators to divide the massive calculations required for the project.&lt;ref name="LANLhist"/&gt; This became Group T-5 under [[New York University]] mathematician Donald Flanders when he arrived in the late summer of 1943. Mathematician Dana Mitchell noticed that the Marchant calculators broke under heavy use and persuaded Frankel and Nelson to order IBM [[punched card]] machines.&lt;ref name="LANLhist"/&gt; This research led to his interest in the then-dawning field of [[digital computers]].{{citation-needed|date=November 2017}} In August 1945, Frankel and [[Nick Metropolis]] traveled to the [[Moore School of Engineering]] in [[Pennsylvania]] to learn how to program the [[ENIAC]] computer.  That fall they helped design a calculation that would determine the likelihood of being able to develop a fusion weapon. [[Edward Teller]] used the ENIAC results to prepare a report in the spring of 1946 that answered this question in the affirmative.  

After losing his security clearance (and thus his job) during the [[Second Red Scare|red scare]] of the early 1950s, Frankel became an independent computer consultant.  He was responsible for designing the CONAC computer for the [[Continental Oil Company]] during 1954–1957 and the [[LGP-30]] single-user desk computer in 1956, which was licensed from a computer he designed  at Caltech called MINAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_onrASurveyomputers1953_8778395|title=A survey of automatic digital computers|last1=Research|first1=United States Office of Naval|date=1953|publisher=Office of Naval Research, Dept. of the Navy|p=65|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LGP-30 was moderately successful, selling over 500 units. He served as a consultant to Packard Bell Computer on the design of the PB-250. His last computing project was the [[Marchant Calculator|SCM Marchant]] Cogito 240SR electronic calculator introduced in 1965.

==Scientific papers==
Frankel published a number of scientific papers throughout his career. Some of them explored the use of statistical sampling techniques and machine driven solutions. In a 1947 paper in ''Physical Review'', he and Metropolis predicted the utility of computers in replacing manual integration with iterative summation as a problem solving technique. As head of a new [[Caltech]] digital computing  group he worked with PhD candidate [[Berni Alder]] in 1949–1950 to develop what is now known as called [[Monte Carlo analysis]].  They used techniques that [[Enrico Fermi]] had pioneered in the 1930s. Due to a lack of local computing resources, Frankel travelled to England in 1950 to run Alder's project on the [[Manchester Mark 1]] computer.  Unfortunately, Alder's thesis advisor was unimpressed, so Alder and Frankel delayed publication of their results until 1955, in the ''Journal of Chemical Physics''.  This left the major credit for the technique to a parallel project by a team including Teller and Metropolis who published similar work in the same journal in 1953. 

In September, 1959, Frankel published a paper in ''IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers'' proposing a microwave computer that used travelling-wave tubes as digital storage devices, similar to, but faster than the [[acoustic delay line]]s used in the early 1950s. Frankel published a paper on measuring the thickness of soap films in the Journal of Applied Physics in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley P. Frankel and Karol J. Mysels, "Simplified Theory of Reflectometric Thickness Measurement of Structured Soap and Related Films", ''Journal of Applied Physics'',  September 1966, Volume 37, Issue 10, pp. 3725-3728&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|Tenjin}}

In [[Japanese mythology|mythology]], [[folklore]] and the [[Shinto religion]] of [[Japan]], {{nihongo|'''Tenjin'''|天神||}} is the [[kami]] of scholarship and learning.

It is the [[deification]] of [[Sugawara no Michizane]] (845–903), the famous scholar, poet and politician of the [[Heian period]].

'''Ten'''  {{lang|ja|天}} means [[sky]] and '''jin''' {{lang|ja|神}} means [[god]] or [[deity]]. The original meaning of Tenjin, sky deity, is almost the same as that of [[Raijin]] (a god of thunder).

==Sugawara no Michizane==
In Japanese history, [[Sugawara no Michizane]] rose high in the government of the country in the late 9th century, but at the beginning of the 10th century he fell victim to the plots of a rival, a member of the [[Fujiwara clan]], and was demoted and exiled to Kyushu. He died in exile in 903. On July 21, 930, the capital city was struck by heavy rain and lightning, and many of the leading Fujiwara died, while fires caused by lightning and floods destroyed many of their residences. The court of the emperor drew the conclusion that the disturbances were caused by Michizane's [[Onryō|angry spirit]], and, to placate it, the emperor restored all Michizane's offices, burned the official order of exile, and ordered that the poet be worshipped under the name Tenjin, which means ''sky deity''. A shrine was established at Kitano; it was immediately raised to the first rank of official shrines, supported directly by the government.

==Evolution into the patron of scholars==
For the first few centuries, then, Tenjin was seen as a god of natural disasters, worshipped to placate him and avoid his [[curse]]s. However, Michizane was a famous poet and scholar in his lifetime, one of the greatest of the [[Heian period]], and in the [[Edo period]] scholars and educators came to regard him as a patron of scholarship. By the present day, this view has completely eclipsed natural disasters in popular worship.

Tenjin's influence is now regarded as particularly strong in passing exams, and so many school students, and their parents, pray for success at his shrine before important entrance exams, and return afterwards, if appropriate, to give thanks for success.

==Things related to Tenjin==
[[Image:Dazaifu Tenmangu Plum Tree 2004-03-07.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The ume tree that in legend flew to Kyushu to be with Sugawara no Michizane]]
Michizane was very fond of ''[[Prunus mume|ume]]'' trees, writing a famous poem from exile in which he lamented the absence of a particular tree he had loved in the capital. Legend states that it flew from Kyoto to Dazaifu in Kyushu to be with him, and the tree is still on show at his shrine there. As a result, shrines to Tenjin often are planted with many ume trees. By coincidence, these trees blossom in February, the same time of year as exam results are announced, and so it is common for Tenjin shrines to hold a festival around this time. 

The animal particularly associated with Tenjin is the bull because, according to legend, during Michizane's funeral procession, the bull pulling the cart bearing his remains refused to go any further than a certain spot, which was then built up into his shrine.

== Shrines ==
{{main|Tenman-gū}}
The main [[Jinja (Shinto)|shrines]] to this kami are [[Kitano Tenman-gū]] in [[Kyoto]] and [[Dazaifu Tenman-gū]] in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], and the top three are rounded out by [[Egara Tenjin Shrine]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], but there are many other shrines dedicated to him across Japan. These shrines are called {{Nihongo||天満宮|[[Tenman-gū]]}}. A group of three notable shrines has been called the [[Three Great Tenjin Shrines]].

'''Walter Vinson Grant, Jr.''', who goes by '''W.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;Grant''' (born May 25, 1945), is a [[Televangelism|televangelist]] whose ministry has been based in the [[Greater Dallas]] area.

==Career==
Grant began his career in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]], in the mid-1970s with the "Cathedral of Compassion" in the poor [[Over-the-Rhine]] area of Cincinnati before relocating to the suburbs of [[St. Bernard, Ohio|St Bernard]] until the early 1980s. The son of minister Walter Vinson Grant, Sr., in 1983 Grant took over Soul's Harbor Church (located in the [[Oak Cliff]] section of Dallas) and expanded its ministry, later renaming the church as "Eagles Nest Cathedral".&lt;ref name="GrantBio"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wvgrant.com/inside/aboutwv.html | title=Who is W. V. Grant |publisher=Wvgrant.com | year=2006 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-01-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061118082526/http://www.wvgrant.com/inside/aboutwv.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-18}} From W.V. Grant website via the Wayback Machine Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Grant purchased {{convert|28|acre|ha|abbr=off}} in the southwest section of Dallas (near [[Dallas Baptist University]]) and built the "Eagle's Nest Family Church", and continued pastoring the 5000-seat church until 1996.&lt;ref name="GrantBio" /&gt;
Grant was convicted in 1996 of [[tax evasion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DM/lib00376,0ED3D6BAAD082CC6.html | title=Evangelist gets 16-month term in tax case |publisher=''The Dallas Morning News'' | date=July 23, 1996 | first= Tim| last= Wyatt| accessdate = 2007-01-18}} &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Purchase necessary&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and since his release from prison he has restarted his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DM/lib00375,0F514E61758F403A.html | title=Preacher's antics still a matter of faith |publisher=''The Dallas Morning News'' | date=July 28, 2002| first= Steve| last= Blow| accessdate = 2007-01-18}} &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Purchase necessary&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He is married to Brenda Gayle Hayes, and has three adult children, Misty, Barry and Mark.&lt;ref name="GrantBio" /&gt;

==Education and degrees==

As of August 2011, Grant's website said about the minister's education and honorary degrees:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After attending [[Southwestern Assemblies of God University|Southwestern Assemblies of God Bible University]], he started in the full-time ministry. He received his undergraduate degrees in English Literature and Religion, as well as his Master's Degree in History from [[Dallas Baptist University]]. He has two honorary degrees from [[Kingsway Christian College|Kingsway Bible University]] (Des Moines, Iowa) and the [[Colonial Academy]] (Chicago).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvgrantchurch.com/about "About," Grant website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paranormal investigator [[James Randi]] examined Grant's practices in his 1987 book, ''[[The Faith Healers]]''. About Grant's degrees, Randi wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . even Grant's college degree is phony. He claims that he obtained it from "[[Midstates Bible College]]" in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] in 1972. He displays the diploma on his office wall. But Midstates wasn't then and isn't now accredited with the [[Iowa Department of Education|Iowa Department of Public Instruction]], as all parochial and public schools are required to be. It wasn't recorded with the secretary of state's office in Iowa as a corporation; nor was it listed in the county recorder's office. It didn't even show up in the telephone directory.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Grant told a reporter in 1986 that he did not graduate from a [[seminary]] but, in Grant's words, had "more or less an honorary D.D. ([[doctor of divinity]]) degree" from Mid-States Bible College in Des Moines, Iowa, which later changed its name to Kingsway Christian College. "They take a formula of how many books you've written, how long you've been in the ministry, maybe how many times you've been on radio and TV," he said.&lt;ref name=MiraclesOnDavisStreet/&gt;

==Faith healing==

Grant has denied being a [[faith healer]], stating that "whatever healing there is, is a gift from God", for which he is merely "a mortal conduit".&lt;ref name=MiraclesOnDavisStreet&gt;Doug J. Swanson, "Miracle on Davis Street?" ''The Dallas Morning News,'' March 23, 1986, via DallasNews.com &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Purchase necessary&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax problems==

In 1996, an [[Internal Revenue Service]] investigation into Grant's ministry resulted in Grant's imprisonment for [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;Tearsa Smith, "Faith Healer's Past Draws Crowds, Skeptics in Knoxville," WATE.com, March 22, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He was found guilty of failing to report $375,000 in taxable income in the purchase of two homes, including his $1 million residence.&lt;ref&gt;"Followers: Pastor's Gospel of Wealth Yielded Little Return," ''Newsday,'' May 11, 2008, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; An undercover video tape was alleged to show Grant admitting that he used $100,000 in 1988 from church members as a down payment on a $1.2 million home overlooking a [[Desoto, Texas]], country club and not reporting it as income. Judge Joe Kendall criticized Grant for attempting to withdraw his plea, asking Grant, "Did you watch the same videotape I watched?" He continued, "He's all over it admitting he's guilty. He swore to God under oath he is guilty".  The judge sentenced Grant to 16 months in prison and a $30,000 fine, to be paid after his release, when he would also serve an additional year of [[probation]]. Kendall also ordered Grant to "perform 100 hours of community service, publish details of his arrest and sentence for everyone on his mailing list and provide complete, continuing financial reports to the court."&lt;ref name="togotoPrison"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/ST/lib00155,0EAF909BA11328FD.html | title=Televangelist to go to prison |publisher=''Fort Worth Star-Telegram'' | date=July 23, 1996 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-01-18}} &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Purchase necessary&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

D. Jakes]], also a televangelist, who renamed it "[[The Potter's House Church, Dallas|The Potter's House]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ctlibrary.com/ct/2000/february7/4.52.html | title=T.D. Jakes Feels Your Pain |publisher=''Christianity Today'' | date=February 7, 2000 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eagles Nest Cathedral==

Grant was released from prison on September 18, 1997, "and has since restarted his ministry, again under the name Eagles Nest Cathedral, in the eastern part of Dallas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/2011/01/12/1417507/healing-services-at-columbus-revival.html Allison Kennedy, "Healing Services at Columbus Revival Center Feature W.V. Grant of Dallas," ''Ledger-Enquirer,'' January 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, W.V. Grant purchased a historic property in downtown Dallas. The former home of "First Church of Christ, Scientist," located at 1508 Cadiz Street, Dallas, Texas 75201 where "The Eagle's Nest Cathedral" and Grant now hold almost nightly services normally lasting from 7:00 PM – 9:00 PM.

==Media coverage==

'''1986–87:''' Scientific skeptic and professional [[stage magic]]ian [[James Randi]] reported that Grant had been supplied with notes concerning the ailments of audience members before the show, that he used a "[[sleight of hand]]" trick to make a person's leg appear to grow, and that he had members of the audience who walked into the event placed into wheelchairs beforehand, then, during the service, he asked them to stand and walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/PI/lib00187,0EB29DCC2DC8153C.html | title=Why Faith Healers Make This Man Sick Proving Them False  |publisher=''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' | date=December 6, 1987 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-01-18}} &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Purchase necessary&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ex-Magician Exposes the Fraud Behind Faith Healers' Feats," ''The Dallas Morning News,'' December 13, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Randi also claimed that Grant's wife first gathered information about members of the audience, which she relayed to her husband via slips of paper in a Bible he displayed during his presentations.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite book| last = Randi | first = James | authorlink = James Randi | year = 1989 | title = [[The Faith Healers]] | publisher = Prometheus Books | isbn = 0-87975-535-0 |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; "They're agnostics," Grant said of his critics in 1986, "Or even atheists."&lt;ref name=MiraclesOnDavisStreet/&gt;

'''1987:''' [[Chicago Tribune]] religion writer Bruce Buursma reported the experiences of one of Randi's fellow investigators, [[Andrew A. Skolnick]], who was twice "healed" by Grant and once by televangelist faith healer [[Peter Popoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.aaskolnick.com/bursma/|title=Healthy Skeptic Snares 'Healer'| work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=17 July 1987|first= Bruce | last= Buursma |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1991:''' Grant was investigated by [[ABC News]] and [[Trinity Foundation (Dallas)|Trinity Foundation]] for an [[Investigative journalism|exposé]] report on ''[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Primetime Live]]'' (with [[Larry Lea]] and [[Robert Tilton]]).&lt;ref name="JudgementPrime"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DM/lib00377,0ED56291649D24AC.html | title=Judgment Day on `Prime Time Live' |publisher=''The Dallas Morning News'' | date=November 21, 1991 | first= Ed| last= Bark| accessdate = 2007-01-18}} &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Purchase necessary&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CultOle"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2006-08-03/news/the-cult-of-ole/1 | title=The Cult of Ole |publisher=''Dallas Observer'' | date=August 3, 2006 | first=Glenna | last=Whitley | accessdate = 2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2006 opinion article in the [[Dallas Observer]] claimed that the examination of documents in various lawsuits revealed deceptive journalistic techniques were utilized by [[ABC News]], and concluded that a key element of the televised Primetime Live report relating to Tilton was "bogus".&lt;ref name="CultOle" /&gt;

The Trinity Foundation also found photos of a naked Grant in his trash and published one in the centrefold of their satirical magazine, ''The Door.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/08/magazine/tm-lobdell49/4|title=Onward Christian Soldier|last=Lobdell|first=William|date=8 December 2008|work=Los Angeles Times (online)|page=4|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1996:''' The Dallas Morning News reported that one of Grant's fundraising letters was apparently written by [[St. Matthew's Churches|Gene Ewing]], who heads a multi-million dollar marketing empire, writing donation letters for other evangelicals like [[Don Stewart (preacher)|Don Stewart]] and [[Robert Tilton]].&lt;ref name="millions"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DM/lib00376,0ED3D68534F95845.html | title=Mailbox ministry: Direct-market evangelist brings in millions lawyer says it all goes back into his mission | publisher=''The Dallas Morning News'' |date=March 10, 1996| first= Howard| last=  Swindle| accessdate =2007-05-17}}&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Purchase necessary&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2003:''' [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] television station [[WAGA-TV]] conducted an investigation on Grant and found that Grant liked to arrive at his revivals early, hours before they were supposed to begin. WAGA reporters showed up early as well, with hidden cameras, and watched the preacher talk to several people already in the church. As it turned out, many of them were people Grant would later pick out of the crowd and "miraculously" announce their name and their disease."&lt;ref name="Fox5investigation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox5atlanta.com/iteam/wvgrant.html |title="Reverend W.V. Grant: An I-Team Investigation," WAGA-TV News, November 3, 2003 |accessdate=June 17, 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031226065057/http://fox5atlanta.com/iteam/wvgrant.html |archivedate=December 26, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report concluded that of three people Grant claimed to heal, two were in worse condition after, and one assisted Grant with the setup with no sign of the condition he claimed during the service.&lt;ref name="Fox5investigation"/&gt; In addition, "healing the short leg" was a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]] demonstrated on a reporter by magician [[James Randi]].&lt;ref name="Fox5investigation"/&gt;

'''2006:''' [[Richmond, Virginia]] television station [[WWBT-TV]] aired an investigation on Grant while he conducted faith healing services at the Richmond Christian Center.

'''2010:''' ''[[Free Inquiry]]'', the magazine of the [[Council for Secular Humanism]], discussed how Grant's act had changed little in the preceding twenty years and detailed his "miracles" at a venue.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Ryan. "Spiritual Healing Revisited" ''Free Inquiry'' Vol. 30, No. 1; p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2011:''' British [[mentalist]] [[Derren Brown]] produced a program "Miracles for Sale" broadcast on [[Channel 4]]. As part of the program, Brown and his team made two visits to Grant's church in Dallas. During the first visit, Grant claimed that "God" had told him the name of a member of Brown's team, but the name he gave out was a false one that the person had written on a contact card prior to the start of the service. This indicated that Grant's knowledge came from the card and not from any supernatural means. On their second visit, Grant performed his leg lengthening "miracle" on Brown himself. The footage showed Grant using the same shoe-manipulation technique that Brown had exposed earlier on the program.&lt;ref&gt;Derren Brown: Miracles for Sale, broadcast 25-04-2011 on Channel 4 at 9pm, viewable online at http://www.channel4.com/programmes/derren-brown-the-specials/4od/player/3182173&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Z. Foster''' (February 25, 1881 &amp;ndash; September 1, 1961) was a [[Political radicalism|radical]] American labor organizer and [[Marxism|Marxist]] politician, whose career included serving as  [[General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party USA]] from 1945 to 1957. He was previously a member of the [[Socialist Party of America]] and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], leading the drive to organize the packinghouse industry during [[World War I]] and the [[steel strike of 1919]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; 

==Biography==
===Early years===
He was born William Edward Foster in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]] on 25 February 1881, the son of a [[Fenian]], James Foster, who had fled [[County Carlow]] after the failure of the revolutionary [[Fenian Rising]] in Ireland and the waves of arrests that drove hundreds of others out of the country. His mother, Elizabeth McLoughlin, was an English [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] textile worker. During his peripatetic childhood his mother had nine surviving children of 23 babies she bore.&lt;ref&gt;Forging American Communism: The Life of William Z Foster by Edward P Johanningsmeier&lt;/ref&gt;

His family moved to the Irish area of Skittereen in [[Philadelphia]], where his father worked as a stableman and was part of a group of Irish-American Fenians. Foster left school at the age of ten to apprentice himself to a die sinker. Foster left that position three years later to work in a [[white lead]] factory. Over the next ten years he worked in [[fertilizer]] plants in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]] and [[Jacksonville, Florida]], as a [[railroad]] construction worker and sawmill employee in [[Florida]], as a [[streetcar]] motorman in New York City, as a lumber camp and [[longshoreman]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] and as a sailor. Foster even homesteaded for a year in [[Oregon]] in 1905, although he also worked a series of odd jobs as a miner, sheepherder, sawmill worker and railroad employee during that year before abandoning the farm.

He was described by [[American Civil Liberties Union]] founder [[Roger Nash Baldwin]] as "tall, slender, blue-eyed and soft-spoken".{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for quotation|date=May 2017}}

===Entry into politics and trade union work===

Foster joined the [[Socialist Party of America]] in 1901 and was a member in the party's [[Socialist Party of Washington|Washington state affiliate]] until he left the party in the midst of a faction fight. Foster then joined the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) in 1909, when he took part in one of the IWW's [[free speech fights]] in [[Spokane, Washington]].

Foster became a prominent figure within the union, serving as its representative at an international labor conference in [[Budapest]] in 1911 and a contributor to its papers. Foster's politics, however, were moving him away from the IWW. He became a committed [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] after touring Europe in 1910 and 1911, and criticized the IWW for not working within established unions or within the workshop in any event. He urged American leftists to enter the AFL unions, rather than establish rival unions, as the IWW had tried to do. He also denounced electoral politics as a dead end that smothered the revolutionary ardor of these groups by channeling their energies into pursuit of office, with all the compromises that entails. Foster lost the battle, however, and soon thereafter left the IWW and formed his own organization, the [[Syndicalist League of North America]] (SLNA).

The SLNA's policies &amp;mdash; [[direct action]] at the shop floor level leading to workers' governance of society, but without the dead weight of bureaucratic structures &amp;mdash; bore a strong resemblance to the [[anarchism|anarchist]] thinking of the day. That is not coincidental, since Foster was not only lecturing at anarchist groups and settlements, but became a close working associate with Jay Fox, an anarchist with roots in the [[Chicago]] labor movement, and married Ester Abramowitz, who had belonged to an anarchist collective in Washington. Among the other members of the SLNA were [[Thomas Mooney|Tom Mooney]] (who became a labor martyr when imprisoned for allegedly throwing a bomb at a Preparedness Day parade in 1916), [[Earl Browder]], an accountant and union activist in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and Foster's rival for the Presidency of the Communist Party twenty years later, and [[James P. Cannon]], a member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] and one of Foster's allies in the internal warfare within the CPUSA until he was expelled for [[Trotskyism]]. The SLNA, however, was never an effective force and folded in 1914.

Foster took his own advice and became a union business agent for a local of the [[Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of America]] in Chicago. He continued his syndicalist campaign, this time through the [[International Trade Union Educational League]], while obtaining a position as a general organizer for the AFL in 1915. His syndicalism led him to drop any criticism of the more conservative union leaders; in his eyes, organizing workers was a step toward dismantling capitalism. The ITUEL did not so much seek to take power in those organizations in which its members were active, as to steer them in a more progressive direction.

Foster also tempered his politics at this time: he not only did not publicly oppose the United States' entry into the war, as [[Eugene V. Debs]], [[Victor Berger]] and figures associated with the IWW had done, but helped sell war bonds in 1918. Foster also remained quiet when the government arrested hundreds of IWW activists, convicting them ''en masse'' in 1918.

Foster did not, on the other hand, become wholly apolitical. The [[Chicago Federation of Labor]] (CFL), headed by [[John Fitzpatrick (unionist)|John Fitzpatrick]], was a nest for a number of labor causes: the campaign to free Tom Mooney, plans to launch a labor party, and, most importantly, programs to organize the thousands of unskilled workers in the City's packinghouses, steel mills and other mass production industries.

===Organizing packinghouse workers===

Unions had tried to organize the packinghouses for decades before [[World War I]]: the [[Knights of Labor]] had led organizing drives among these workers in the 1870s and 1880s, while the [[Amalgamated Meat Cutters|Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen]] had made gains among the many diverse ethnic groups working in the industry in the first decade of the century. In both cases the industry, now concentrated in the hands of a few large and powerful corporations, drove the unions out.

The war, however, changed things. The demand for meat increased tremendously during the war, while the draft and the difficulty of importing more workers from Europe led to labor shortages that reduced the number of persons willing to scab in the event of a strike. In addition, the federal government had an interest in maintaining production unimpeded and avoiding the disruption that a strike of 50,000 packinghouse workers would entail. This was an especially propitious time to organize these workers on an [[industrial unionism|industrial]] basis; as Foster said, "The gods were indeed fighting on the side of labor".

Before the CFL could organize these workers, however, it had to work out the competing claims of all of the various unions that claimed the right to represent segments of the industry. Rather than create a wholly new organization, which would have immediately found itself fighting other unions in the CFL over jurisdiction, Foster hit on the idea of creating a Stockyards Labor Council (SLC) that, like the railroad federations that had recently come into being, would fuse all of the interested unions into a single body with the ability to organize the industry as a whole. Foster obtained the endorsement of his union, the Railway Carmen, for this plan then took the proposal to Local 87 of the Meat Cutters, who supported it enthusiastically and obtained the approval of the CFL on July 15, 1917. The SLC was formed a week later, with representatives from all of the crafts &amp;mdash; [[International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers|machinists]], [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers|electricians]], [[United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America|carpenters]], coopers, office workers, steamfitters, engineers, railway carmen, and firemen. While this body was only a coalition created for the purpose of organizing workers, and would not have had the authority to bargain for them as a single group, it was an important step toward industrial unionism. Foster was the secretary for the SLC.

Another factor posed a serious obstacle to organizing packinghouse workers: many of the unions in the SLC excluded African-Americans from membership, either overtly or in practice. Thousands of recent African-American migrants from the [[Southern United States|South]] had gone to work in the packinghouses and many looked upon their employers as more interested in their welfare than the unions that had either excluded them or shown no interest in organizing them. The SLC, for its part, offered membership in federal unions affiliated directly with the AFL, only to have this offer thrown back at it as "[[Jim Crow]] unionism". The same pattern of division prevailed among immigrant workers, who organized along national or linguistic lines.

While privately convinced that launching a strike under these conditions would be a mistake, and aware that the AFL leadership felt even more strongly on this subject, Foster nonetheless continued to organize as if a strike was in the offing. The rank and file workers voted overwhelmingly in November, 1917 and more moderate leaders, such as Fitzpatrick and the leader of Local 87, used this strike threat to great advantage in negotiating with the federal government and the employers.

The [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] administration wanted to bring about a peaceful resolution of this dispute and put great pressure on the employers to agree to arbitration of the issues in dispute &amp;mdash; wages, hours of work, and union recognition &amp;mdash; without a strike, even threatening to seize the plants as a wartime measure if necessary. While the unions had their own reservations about arbitration, they also agreed to it rather than find themselves forced to strike. The arbitrator's initial award, ordering the [[eight-hour day]], overtime pay and significant wage increases, was a major victory for the workers. The Amalgamated Meat Cutters' membership doubled in the months that followed.

Those gains were short-lived, however. The arbitration award had not required the employers to recognize the unions, leading some workers to believe that the government, not the SLC, was responsible for these improvements in their wages and hours. In addition, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters attempted to claim all of the members as its own, breaking off relations with the SLC. Race riots in Chicago in 1919 dissolved what little trust black packinghouse workers had in white-led unions. Once the arbitration award expired in 1919 employers fired union activists; by 1922, after a failed strike, the SLC was defunct.

===The steel strike of 1919===

[[File:Foster-William-Z-c1920.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bill Foster was a key labor union organizer on the eve of the 1920s.]]
{{main|Steel Strike of 1919}}

Foster turned his attention, while the packinghouse campaign was still underway, to another project: organizing steel workers. The problems here were even more complex: in addition to the history of defeated strikes and the deep ethnic divisions within the workforce, the steel mills were also divided by differences in skills, with the higher paid native-born skilled workers often looking down on their immigrant coworkers, who were often unskilled or semiskilled. Foster proposed a similar strategy, but on a much larger scale: a national campaign, led by a union council of all the craft unions and the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers|Amalgamated Association of Iron, Tin and Steel Workers]], that would organize all of basic steel simultaneously. Fitzpatrick agreed to put his name on the project and sent Foster as the CFL's delegate to the AFL's 1918 convention to present the plan.

The AFL's reception was tepid: it endorsed a special conference to create a committee to organize steel workers, but each international union contributed only one hundred dollars apiece &amp;mdash; leaving the committee with somewhat less than the $250,000 Foster estimated it needed. Many unions did, on the other hand contribute organizers, whom Foster used as his base.

Without the funds to launch a truly national campaign, Foster decided to start close to home, sending organizers into [[Gary, Indiana]], and [[South Chicago]], where they received a tumultuous outpouring of support, in August 1918. The Chicago area was not, however, the heart of the steel industry; the [[Monongahela Valley]] was.

By the time that Foster sent organizers into that area several months later, however, the [[1918 flu epidemic|influenza epidemic]] had led the authorities to bar all public meetings; the announcement of the armistice soon led to widespread layoffs in the mills. The union no longer could rely on a tight labor market or a federal government interested in labor peace. The union faced other problems: the rivalries spurred by the constituent unions' self-interest and the omnipresent power of the industry, which had turned the Valley into a large version of a company town.

Even so, the National Committee for Organizing Iron and Steel Workers managed to sign up more than 100,000 steel workers by early 1919. The strike vote, taken in August 1919, was almost unanimous in favor of a strike. When the steel companies refused to meet with union officials, 250,000 steelworkers went out on strike on September 22.

The National Committee's organizing efforts had produced mixed results: while it enrolled around 350,000 steelworkers during the course of the strike, its greatest strength was among immigrant workers. Higher skilled native born workers gave the strike only lukewarm support, while black steelworkers gave it almost none at all in the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] area and less than enthusiastic support elsewhere.

The authorities attacked with their customary violence: within ten days fourteen people had been killed, all of them strikers or strike sympathizers. Vigilantes expelled Foster from [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], at gunpoint. Foster himself became the focus of a Congressional inquiry that was originally initiated to study the causes of the strike. In the meantime authorities barred strikers from meeting.

Foster spent most of his time raising money and organizing material assistance for strikers and their families. In the meantime General [[Leonard Wood]] imposed martial law in Gary while authorities in Pennsylvania broke up strike meetings wherever they could be found. By November, as funds were running low, the strike was losing steam. Foster and the other members of the committee voted to end it in January, 1920. Foster resigned from the committee in order to allow it to continue its work "with a clean slate".

===Joining the Communist Party===
[[File:The Soviet Union 1971 CPA 4066 stamp (William Z. Foster and View of New York).jpg|thumb|William Z. Foster on the silhouette of buildings in New York and a meeting of workers, stamp of USSR 1971.]]

After his resignation from the National Committee following the defeat of the steel workers strike, Foster was at loose ends. He resigned his position as a Brotherhood of Railway Carmen organizer, but was blacklisted from other jobs on the railroad. He still maintained his friendship with John Fitzpatrick, wrote a book analyzing the steel strike and founded the [[Trade Union Educational League]], which received financial support from the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]], the left-led union that had contributed $100,000 for relief for steel strikers.

Foster had contacts with a number of members of the newly formed Communist Party, but had not joined it after its split from the [[Socialist Party of America]] in 1919. The party had, in fact, denounced him personally during the strike as an opportunist and class collaborator, calling him "E.Z. Foster" for the accommodations he was willing to make with the AFL leadership. The CP at this time was still convinced that the revolution was impending; its suggested slogan during the steel strike was "Make the strike general and seize state power!"

Foster was brought closer within the party's orbit, however, after [[Earl Browder]] invited him to attend a conference of the [[Profintern]], the Red International of Labor Unions, in Moscow in 1921. There he was appointed the Profintern's agent in the United States; the TUEL was later made an affiliate of the Profintern in 1923. Foster joined the CPUSA on his return to the United States.

===The Trade Union Educational League===

The TUEL, like the ITUEL and SLNA before it, sought to encourage the development of left activists within the established unions and unite those already there around a platform of industrial unionism, and to support the militant struggle for workers' rights. In its early years Foster's TUEL pursued a course of its own, not attempting to line up its policies with [[Comintern]] or Profintern directives or taking direction from the CPUSA. When party leaders complained, the Profintern sided with Foster.

The TUEL took pains to avoid accusations of dual unionism; when the Profintern requested that TUEL start building itself as a mass membership organization Foster demurred, maintaining TUEL as a network of activists with no formal membership. TUEL was strongest in Chicago, where Foster and Jack Johnstone had close relations with Fitzpatrick and many other unionists with a background in labor radicalism. TUEL campaigned for amalgamation of unions into larger, stronger ones—an echo of the IWW's advocacy of "one big union"&amp;mdash;and creation of a Labor Party—which was an anathema to those who remained in the IWW.

Its first test was the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1922|Railway Shopmen's strike of 1922]], which was crushed by the employers with the help of an [[injunction]] that prohibited strikers from trying to dissuade strikebreakers from taking their jobs by any means, including word of mouth or newspaper interviews. TUEL leafleted at picket lines and continued to press for amalgamation of the separate craft unions in the industry.

TUEL also intervened in the internal politics of the [[United Mine Workers of America]], where [[Alexander Howat]] was leading a revolt of miners from [[Kansas]], [[Illinois]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Nova Scotia]] against the regime of [[John L. Lewis]]. Lewis responded by ejecting all those connected with the insurgency from the union in 1923.

===The Farmer-Labor Party===
[[File:Foster-william-z-2.jpg|right|thumb|William Z. Foster in May 1923.]]

Foster had enjoyed a close relationship with John Fitzpatrick of the Chicago Federation of Labor. Those relations were strained to the breaking point by the Party's decision to pack the convention that Fitzpatrick had called to form a new [[Farmer-Labor Party]].

Fitzpatrick's project presented Foster with a paradox: he did not think that electoral politics had much potential for advancing the rights of workers, much less revolutionary goals, and he had even less regard for progressive reformists such as [[Robert La Follette, Sr.]]. On the other hand, he was attacked from the left within the party for his relations with Fitzpatrick and the CFL, which were denounced as too conservative. Even so, [[John Pepper]], the [[Comintern]]'s representative in the U.S., and those, such as [[Charles Ruthenberg]], who had criticized Foster for his closeness to Fitzpatrick now directed Foster to make the CPUSA an important player in this new party. At the same time the Party's newspaper, then known as ''The Worker'', published a flattering article about Foster in 1923 that identified him as a Communist, something he had to that point avoided admitting.

Fitzpatrick began to distance himself from Foster when his membership in the Communist Party became public knowledge. Foster and the CP, on the other hand, had enough influence within the CFL to be able to dominate the founding convention with representatives of various organizations, some of them existing only on paper. When the CP appeared to have taken over this new party, Fitzpatrick walked out, leaving the CP with a stillborn organization. From that point forward Fitzpatrick campaigned against TUEL and the AFL began expelling communists from its ranks with a vengeance. The Party likewise split the Minnesota-Farmer Labor Party and repudiated any common work with La Follette. After a disastrous showing in the 1924 elections, the Party dismantled the Federated Farmer-Labor Party it had created.

The split with Fitzpatrick led to the isolation within the labor movement. While Foster and the CP had enjoyed a close relation with [[Sidney Hillman]] and the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]], it began organizing an opposition caucus within the ACWA. Hillman declared the TUEL formation to be a dual union and suspended its leaders, including [[Benjamin Gitlow]].

===Setbacks and successes===

Foster profited in a way from this debacle: he was able to persuade the Comintern to recall Pepper, with whom he had fought over questions of tactics, and the dissolution of the FF-LP was a setback for the [[Charles Ruthenberg]] &amp;ndash; [[Jay Lovestone]] faction, which was largely made up of foreign-born workers and represented the vast majority of the party membership. Forming an alliance with a smaller faction led by [[James P. Cannon]], Foster was able to control the majority of the party's leadership in 1923 and again in 1925.

The internecine struggles between the two camps was, however, disturbing to the Comintern, which sent a representative to oversee the Party's 1925 convention. A telegram from the Comintern directed the Party, after a vote which Foster had won decisively over his opponent, [[Benjamin Gitlow]], to install Ruthenberg as general secretary of the Party. Foster challenged the telegram, stormed out of the meeting, and attempted to appeal to the Comintern itself, over the objections of his opponents and even his allies in the Cannon faction, who would not accept the possibility that the Comintern could be wrong.

Foster did not succeed in reversing the Comintern's overturning of his election, but did obtain some concessions: his supporters were given control of the Trade Union Committee within the Party and the Comintern recognized trade union work as the most important sphere of activity for the Party. While Foster thought that he had obtained support for effective independence for TUEL, however, he was mistaken.

The Party's trade union work in this era, however, went from one disaster to the next. Rivalries within the CPUSA led to the loss of the 1926 New York dressmakers' strike, as neither the Foster or Ruthenberg faction wanted to appear to sell out by accepting a settlement that the Party's members within the strike leadership had recommended. As a result, the Party, which had once held leadership positions within every major New York City local of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] other than the cutters local led by [[David Dubinsky]], was wholly routed.

The Foster and Ruthenberg factions likewise blamed each other for the defeat of the [[1926 Passaic Textile Strike|1926 strike of textile workers]] in [[Passaic, New Jersey]], in which the Ruthenberg leadership supported an overt Party role in the strike and what amounted to creation of a dual union. When it appeared that the leadership's communist leanings were an obstacle to negotiations, TUEL handed the strike over to the United Textile Workers, which was unable to make any more progress than the CP leadership had.

Foster also played a major role in the revolt against [[John L. Lewis]]' leadership in the [[United Mine Workers of America]]. [[John Brophy (labor)|John Brophy]], a leader of the UMWA in Western Pennsylvania, ran against Lewis under the banner of "Save the Union". Brophy might have won if the ballots had been counted honestly, but they were not. Even so, the dissidents retained substantial prestige within the union and were able to establish themselves as a union administration in exile during the 1927 coal strike, running a separate program of strike relief that allowed the strike to continue when the Lewis Administration proved unable to do so.

These efforts were leading in the direction of formation of a rival union, something that Foster rejected but which appeared to be the only possibility left to the Party. As signals from the Comintern indicated the impending change of policy in the [[Third Period]], when the American party was directed to abandon its work within the AFL in order to form separate revolutionary unions, even former supporters of Foster, such as [[Earl Browder]], began criticizing Foster for his reluctance to form a dual union of miners. As it turned out, Foster's halting efforts to establish a separate power center within the UMWA had this effect in any case, as Howat, Brophy and his allies dropped out of the "Save the Union" movement as the CP's leadership in it became apparent. The Party founded its own National Miners Union in 1928.

===Foster's return to power===

C. E. Ruthenberg died on March 2, 1927, and his longtime factional ally Jay Lovestone took over his position as Executive Secretary of the party. The factional fighting between the Foster and Lovestone groups continued, but now became overshadowed by the larger struggle in the Soviet Union between [[Joseph Stalin]] and his opponents.

A firm supporter of [[Joseph Stalin]], Foster split with [[James P. Cannon]] in 1928 and supported his former ally's expulsion for [[Trotskyism]]. Foster was made [[General Secretary]] of the party in 1929 with the support of the [[Comintern]], deposing [[Jay Lovestone]], who was sympathetic to [[Bukharin]] and whose policies of [[American exceptionalism]] were anathema to Stalin's new [[Third Period]] line.

That Third Period line also called for creation of new, revolutionary unions outside the AFL. While Foster had always denounced dual unionism, he dutifully complied with the Comintern's directive, renaming the Trade Union Education League as the [[Trade Union Unity League]]. Foster and the Party also followed the line by denouncing social democrats as "social fascists" and attacking former allies in the [[African-American]] communities as bourgeois collaborators.

===Eclipse and return to power===

Foster began to lose power within the Party, due to his imprisonment during the Party's convention in 1930 and his continuing differences with others in the Party over trade union policies. In [[New York state election, 1930|1930]], he ran for [[Governor of New York]] on the Communist ticket. 

Foster was nominated for President yet again in 1932, but he suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on the campaign trail and was forced to step down as leader of the party in favor of [[Earl Browder]]. Sent to the Soviet Union for treatment, Foster's condition only grew worse. A period followed in which Foster was separated from political activity.

Foster returned to politics late in 1935, but was estranged from Browder and those who had risen to power in his absence. While the Party's trade union policies in the [[Popular Front]] era was close to what Foster had advocated in the 1920s, the Party's strength was not in the areas in which it had been active during the TUEL era &amp;mdash; garment, railroads, and mining &amp;mdash; but in the mass production industries with little history of union organization &amp;mdash; automobile and electrical manufacturing, meatpacking, longshore on the west coast, maritime on the east coast, hard rock mining and lumber in the west and public transit in [[New York City]]. In the meantime the Party began building a small-scale [[personality cult]] around Browder and became a supporter of the [[New Deal]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration both of which Foster hated. Foster became the "loyal opposition" to Browder within the CPUSA while remaining an unwavering supporter of Stalin.

Browder was removed in 1945 due to having attempted to dissolve the CPUSA as a party. Foster had, in fact, been one of the most vocal opponents in 1944 of Browder's decisions to rename the CPUSA as the [[Communist Political Association]] and to propose the continuation of the [[no-strike pledge]] after the end of World War II. The entire leadership of the Party came to Browder's defense then; the Comintern directed Foster to withdraw his criticisms.

Foster's letter to the National Committee subsequently formed the basis for the [[Jacques Duclos|Duclos letter]] published as the [[Cold War]] began in 1945 that signaled the Soviet Union's change in line. The Party members who had denounced Foster and questioned his grasp of Marxism and his mental faculties a year earlier now condemned Browder as a [[class traitor]]. The CPA reestablished itself as the Communist Party USA and expelled Browder. While Foster nominally shared power with [[Eugene Dennis]] and [[John Williamson (communist)|John Williamson]], he had the most prestige of the three.

During Foster's leadership the Party took a harder line, both internationally and internally, shedding much of the "Americanist" rhetoric of Browder's dozen years in leadership. Foster published a 'new history' of America, which was highly praised in Moscow and was translated into many languages. Of it Browder wrote, "This extraordinary book interpreted the history of America from its discovery to the present, as an orgy of 'bloody banditry' and imperialism, enriching itself by 'drinking the rich red blood' of other peoples.

The Party campaigned vigorously for [[Henry A. Wallace]]'s candidacy for President in 1948 &amp;mdash; which failed to produce a viable [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]]. The failure of the campaign and the onset of the [[Cold War]] contributed to a disastrous situation for the unions and union leaders associated with the Party within the CIO, which expelled most of them by 1950.

In 1948 Foster was among the party leaders [[Foley Square trial|indicted for subversive activity]] under the [[Smith Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Foster supported [[Joseph Stalin]] and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. He rallied the party's faithful during the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Soviet Union's military intervention in Hungary]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s denunciation of Stalin at the 1956 [[Twentieth Party Congress]]. Foster retired in 1957 and assumed the title of Chairman emeritus of the party to make way for the younger [[Gus Hall]]. Like Foster, Gus Hall was also a loyal ally of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Foster was also the party's candidate for [[President of the United States]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1924|1924]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1928|1928]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1932|1932]] [[U.S. presidential election]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

His ashes were laid to rest in the Kremlin wall. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 7, 1961 |accessdate=2009-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His book [[Toward Soviet America]] remains a favorite among American communists, and has been continuously republished by both leftists and anti-communists who see it as scandalous. One edition of the book was published with the subtitle "The Book the Communists tried to Destroy!" 

The founding documents of the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]] portrayed Foster as representing the best side of the Communist Party, while blaming reformist and revisionist tendencies on [[Earl Browder]]. Many of the small sects of the 1970s [[New Communist Movement]] eulogized and upheld Foster as their icon. Many biographies of Foster have been published by American academics and historians. 

At a debate entitled "The Revolutionary Left vs. The Revolution Right" between Alt-Rightist [[Augustus Sol Invictus]] and Communist Journalist [[Caleb Maupin]], Maupin described himself as a "student of [[Eugene Debs]], William Z. Foster and [[Huey Newton]]."

'''Women in San Marino''' are [[European women]] who live in or are from the [[Republic of San Marino]]. Sammarinese women currently share almost all social and political rights with men in San Marino.&lt;ref name=Arnold/&gt; 

==Political rights==
[[San Marino]] introduced women's suffrage following the 1957 constitutional crisis known as [[Fatti di Rovereta]]. Sammarinese women received the right to vote in 1960. They received the right to hold political office in 1973.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;{{cite web|last=Arnold|first=M. Cameron|title=San Marino|url=http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/San-Marino.html|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Citizenship rights==
Before the 21st century, citizenship laws discriminated significantly against women. In a 1982 referendum, the women of San Marino did not win the right to retain their Sammarinese citizenship if they married male foreigners (19,000 Sammarinese voters voted to not abolish the 1928 law that striped Sammarinese women of Sammarinese citizenship if they married foreigners); as a result of losing Sammarinese citizenship, the women also lost the right to vote, to work, to own property, to reside in, and to inherit property in the Republic of San Marino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=edited by Anne Shutt|first=CS Monitor Correspondents,|title=Women lose ballot battle in republic of San Marino|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0727/072717.html|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws were later changed; in 2000 the parliament passed a new citizenship law abolishing the previous citizenship law, under which a woman who married a foreigner could not transmit citizenship to her husband or children;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/eur/8334.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004, new laws stipulated that all women who were San Marino citizens transmitted their own citizenship to their children at birth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=8989&amp;LangID=E&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence against women==
In 2008, San Marino  passed ''Law No.97 of 20 June 2008 on Prevention and Repression of Violence Against Women and Gender Violence''. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.esteri.sm/on-line/en/home/documentation/chairmanship-of-the-committee-of-ministers-of-the-council-of-europe/council-of-europe---initiatives-during-the-chairmanship/documento1000875.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Womyn-born womyn''' ('''WBW''') is a term developed during [[second-wave feminism]] to designate women who were [[sex assignment|identified as female at birth]], were raised as girls, and identify as [[woman|women]] (or [[womyn]], a deliberately [[Satiric misspelling|alternative spelling]] that challenges the centering of [[male as norm]]).

Events and organizations that have womyn-born-womyn-only policies bar access to anyone who was assigned [[male]] at birth: male children of attendees, [[Trans woman|trans women]], [[gay men]], [[bisexual men]] and [[heterosexual men]]. These [[cisgender]] [[women-only space]]s have raised a number of concerns from transgender groups.

==Second-wave feminism==
The term gained usage and popularity during the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] movement. In 1978, the [[Lesbian Organization of Toronto]] adopted a womyn-born  womyn-only policy in response to a request for admittance by a transgender woman who identified as lesbian. Womyn-born womyn policies held that the nature of the feminine experience over the course of a lifetime could only be experienced by someone who experienced life presenting as a woman.&lt;ref name=raymond1994&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Transsexual Empire |last=Raymond|first=Janice|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=978-0807021644|location=|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent was to create a space for only women, defined not by identity but experience, defined in a way that excluded transgender women.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys1990&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anticlimax: a feminist perspective on the sexual revolution|last=Jeffreys|first=Sheila|publisher=Women's Press|year=1990|isbn=9780704342033|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-wave feminism is a period in the feminist movement lasting from the 1960s until around the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Gamble2001&gt;Sarah Gamble, ed. ''The Routledge companion to feminism and postfeminism'' (2001) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}} Some feminists of the period such as scholars [[Sheila Jeffreys]], [[Janice Raymond]], and [[Theology|theologist]] [[Mary Daly]] were proponents of womyn-born womyn policies. These policies created controversy and scholarly discussion.

Raymond's ''[[The Transsexual Empire]]'' (1979) is often seen as the characterizing work of this movement. It is known for its view of trans women as privileged men who did not previously live in the oppression of the [[patriarchy]], stating, "We know who we are. We know that we are women who are born with female chromosomes and anatomy, and that whether or not we were socialised to be so-called normal women, patriarchy has treated and will treat us like women. Transsexuals have not had this same history."&lt;ref name=raymond1994 /&gt;

{{quote box|align=left|quote=|source=The surgeons and hormone therapists of the transsexual kingdom, in their effort to give birth, can be said to produce feminine persons. They cannot produce women. – Mary Daly&lt;ref name=Daly1990&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Mary|title=Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism|date=1990|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|isbn=978-0807014134|page=68|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=19%}}

Jeffreys was similarly outspoken in her criticisms of trans women, arguing that the feminine characteristics they were adopting are simply those that women must adopt to avoid punishment from the patriarchy. She believed trans women adopt [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] attributes that are enforced by the patriarchy and were political signifiers of the oppression of women.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys1990 /&gt;

[[Judith Butler]], despite being opposed to womyn-born womyn policies, is often used as an argument for them by modern second-wave feminists. Butler's ''Gender Trouble'' (1990) contained discussion of [[performativity]] versus performance, which second-wave feminists used to exclude trans women on account of their performativity through repetition of [[gender norm]]s, which is "real only to the extent that it is performed", which was used as a separator from experience.&lt;ref name=Disch2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Disch|first1=Lisa Jane|last2=Hawkesworth|first2=M. E.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a_X8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA575|year=2016|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|page=575|oclc=967840756|isbn=978-0-19-932858-1|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olivia Records]], a feminist music collective, employed transgender employees, notably [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]].&lt;ref name=Vogel1977&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eminism.org/michigan/1977-lettertooliviarecords.pdf|title=Sister, June 1977 Letter|last=Vogel|first=Lisa|date=1977|website=Eminism Archives|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, Michigan Womyn's Music Festival's primary owner in 1977, Lisa Vogel, issued a letter to the music collective along with other second wave feminists:
{{quote|Dear Olivia:

We are writing concerning your decision to employ Sandy Stone as your recording engineer and sound technician. We feel that it was and is irresponsible of you to have presented this person as a woman to the women’s community when in fact he is a post-operative transsexual.

Given the narrow options available to us, it is also likely that many of us would have to work with Stone. Some of us have already done so without the knowledge that this person was not a woman. When we did discover the truth about Stone and tried to discuss this with you, we were told that you considered him very much a woman, a lesbian, and that you trusted him more than middle class, heterosexual women. This was very painful to hear and indicated a great lack of respect and love for women and our struggle. We do not believe that a man without a penis is a woman any more than we would accept a white woman with dyed skin as a Black woman.&lt;ref name=Vogel1977 /&gt;}}

=== Women-only spaces ===
Throughout the final quarter of the twentieth century, [[women's music]] festivals often enacted womyn-born womyn policies. Although [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] people had been present in [[women-only space|"women-only spaces"]] for decades (usually [[closeted]] or [[passing (gender)|passing]]),{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} the term garnered wider attention in response to the exclusion of trans women from the [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]] (MichFest) after it was described as a gathering for "women born as women and living as women".&lt;ref name=vitello2006&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vitello|first1=Paul|title=The Trouble When Jane Becomes Jack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/fashion/20gender.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 20, 2006|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, a gender survey was taken at MichFest by Nancy Burkholder&lt;ref name=Taormino2000 /&gt; that asked, "Do you think male-to-female transsexuals should be welcome at Michigan?"&lt;ref name=Burkholder1992&gt;{{Cite web|last=Burkholder|first=Nancy|title=MWMF Anti-TS Awareness: 1992 Gender Survey Results|url=http://eminism.org/michigan/documents.html|website=Eminism.org|date=28 April 1993|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of approximately 7500 women present, 633 responded to the inquiry with 73.1% (463) responding "yes" and 22.6% (143) responding "no" (the margin of error was 3.8%). Although admitting that the sample was not "randomly selected", surveyors calculated the results as indicating that "less than 1 in 100,000" attendees would be against the exclusion of transsexual women from the festival; and while the replies about "female-to-male transsexuals" were not tabulated, it was determined that "80% of respondents were against their inclusion".&lt;ref name=Burkholder1992 /&gt; However, the presence of male-to-female transsexual people at MichFest was understood to exist.&lt;ref name=myths2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Myths and The Truth About the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|url=http://www.thetruthaboutthemichiganfestival.com|website=thetruthaboutthemichiganfestival.com|date=September 2014|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cogswell2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cogswell|first1=Kelly|title=Dyke-Baiting, Trans-Hating, and the MichFest Debacle|url=http://gaycitynews.nyc/dyke-baiting-trans-hating-michfest-debacle/|website=[[Gay City News]]|date=April 29, 2015|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[third-wave feminism]], objections to womyn-born womyn policies increased.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Many women-only music festivals also began to close. The RadFem Collective, which describes its membership as "restricted to 'women born women and living as women'", continues to promote womyn-born womyn policies.&lt;ref name=Kaveney2012&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kaveney|first= Roz|title=Radical feminists are acting like a cult|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/25/radical-feminism-trans-radfem2012?INTCMP=SRCH|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=25 May 2012|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement for the 2015 conference was rephrased in explanatory form to read "RadFems Resist is a women only, feminist event. Our conference is a space for women to share our experiences as women, to politically self organise for women's liberation and to celebrate womanhood in a safe environment. We welcome all women who were raised and socialized as girls to join us...We are gender abolitionists who have been raised and socialized as girls and women *because of our female bodies* in the context of patriarchy."&lt;ref name=RadFems2015&gt;{{Cite web|title=RadFems Resist 2015|url=http://www.radfemcollective.org/upcoming-events/radfemsresist2015|website=RadFem Collective|date=2015|accessdate= February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 40 years, the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival held its last event in 2015.&lt;ref name=dearsisters2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|title=Dear Sisters, Amazon, Festival family|url=https://www.facebook.com/michfest/posts/10153186431364831|website=[[Facebook]]|date=April 21, 2015|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This final gathering followed the withdrawal of support by the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]], [[National LGBTQ Task Force]], and ''The TransAdvocate'' [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] website, of a boycott petition against MichFest and its womyn-born womyn intention.&lt;ref name=Ring2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ring|first1=Trudy|title=This Year's Michigan Womyn's Music Festival Will Be the Last|url=https://www.advocate.com/michfest/2015/04/21/years-michigan-womyns-music-festival-will-be-last|website=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=April 21, 2015|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other instances where transgender women have been denied access to, or been evicted from, women's spaces; for example, the [[Vancouver Rape Relief &amp; Women's Shelter]] and [[Mountain Moving Coffeehouse]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Third-wave feminism ==
The [[feminist sex wars]] signaled a divide in second-wave feminism on issues of sex expression, pornography, sexuality, and gender identity. It led to many trans-affirming feminist views, and more criticism toward the womyn-born womyn culture that thrived in [[radical feminism]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} With the rise of [[third-wave feminism]], the radical feminism that supports womyn-born womyn policies and agendas became less prevalent.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[Judith Butler]] was characteristic in her approach to third-wave feminist opposition of womyn-born womyn politics. The fluidity in gender, a more modern adaptation in feminist thought, is reflected in her views, "We form ourselves within the vocabularies that we did not choose, and sometimes we have to reject those vocabularies, or actively develop new ones.  For instance, gender assignment is a 'construction' and yet many [[genderqueer]] and trans people refuse those assignments in part or in full.  That refusal opens the way for a more radical form of self-determination, one that happens in solidarity with others who are undergoing a similar struggle."&lt;ref name=TERF2014&gt;{{Cite web|last=Admin|url=http://theterfs.com/2014/05/01/judith-butler-addresses-terfs-and-the-work-of-sheila-jeffreys-and-janice-raymond/|title=Judith Butler addresses TERFs and the work of Sheila Jeffreys and Janice Raymond|website=The TERFs|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in response to claims by Jeffreys and others of the time who believed that those born womyn embodied true patriarchal struggle, while transgender women still benefited from the patriarchy. In a more direct reaction from Butler, she states, "The feminist police comes along to expose the construction and dispute a trans person's sense of their lived reality. I oppose this use of social construction absolutely, and consider it to be a false, misleading, and oppressive use of the theory."&lt;ref name=TERF2014 /&gt; Some prominent figures in the second wave also readjusted views when presented with changing times, such as [[Gloria Steinem]], who previously referred to transgender women as men with mutilated bodies in the late 1970s, and has since revised her beliefs as stated in a 2013 opinion piece: "I believe that transgender people, including those who have transitioned, are living out real, authentic lives. Those lives should be celebrated, not questioned."&lt;ref name=Steinem2013&gt;{{Cite web|last=Steinem|first=Gloria|url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/10/02/op-ed-working-together-over-time|title=Op-ed: On Working Together Over Time|website=The Advocate|date= 2 October 2013|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transfeminism ===
The understanding of gender, gender politics, and [[transfeminism|trans politics]] has changed over the latter half of the twentieth century and  has led to more [[LGBT|LGBTQ]]-led opposition to womyn-born womyn policies and the music festivals that tend to employ them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Kelsie Brynn Jones, a transgender woman and advocate, wrote that "in [radical feminists'] words, a transgender woman is a ''[sic]'' nothing but a 'self loathing gay man' and they claim that trans women are gay men who, rather than stand up and come out as gay, would rather 'hide' by being transgender, as if it makes things more palatable for friends, family and co-workers."&lt;ref name=Jones2014&gt;{{Cite web|last=Jones|first=Kelsie Brynn|title=Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminism: What Exactly Is It, And Why Does It Hurt|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kelsie-brynn-jones/transexclusionary-radical-terf_b_5632332.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=August 2, 2014|accessdate= February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists for transgender-inclusionary policies often refer to those who promote womyn-born womyn policies as [[Feminist views on transgender topics#The term "TERF"|TERFs]], an acronym meaning "Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists".&lt;ref name=TERF2013&gt;{{Cite web|last=Admin|url=http://theterfs.com/|title= Rad Fem ≠ TERF|website=TheTERFs.com|date=March 2013|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Camp Trans ====
In 1991, Nancy Burkholder was kicked out of the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival for being transgender.&lt;ref name=Taormino2000&gt;{{Cite web|last=Taormino|first=Tristan|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/trouble-in-utopia-6417677|title=Trouble in Utopia|website=Village Voice|date=September 12, 2000|access-date=2016-03-23|archiveurl=https://archive.is/gdXp|archivedate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
With support from the [[Lesbian Avengers]], she and other activists, specifically transgender women, created [[Camp Trans]] in 1992 to stage protests outside of the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival against its womyn-born womyn policy.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Transgender supporters passed out flyers and held workshops across the road from the festival.&lt;ref name=Taormino2000 /&gt; Transgender activist [[Julia Serano]] described the festival as insensitive and ignorant: "[The] idea that the femaleness of my mind, personality, lived experiences, and the rest of my body can somehow be trumped by the mere presence of a penis can only be described as phallocentric."&lt;ref name=Serano2007&gt;{{Cite book|last=Serano|first=Julia|title=Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity|publisher=Seal Press|year=2007|location=|page=|isbn=978-1580051545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activist [[Riki Wilchins]] noted that Camp Trans "was the first time that significant numbers of the hard-core lesbian feminist community backed us”.
