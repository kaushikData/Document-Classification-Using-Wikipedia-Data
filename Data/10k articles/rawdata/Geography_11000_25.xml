'''Aboccis''' or '''Abuncis''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀβουγκίς}}) was a town in [[Aethiopia]], between the [[Second Cataract]] and [[Syene]] (modern Aswan), situated on the left bank of the [[Nile]] mentioned by [[Ptolemy]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geog.]] 4.7.16.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pliny the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)|Nat. Hist.]] 6.35.&lt;/ref&gt; It was renowned on account of the two magnificent grotto temples, which were discovered at this place by [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]]. The walls of the larger of the two temples were covered with paintings, which recorded the victories of [[Ramses III]] over various nations of Africa and Asia. [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] identifies the place with [[Abu Simbel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3371">An '''anatopism''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀνά, "against," and τόπος, "place") is something that is out of its proper place.  Thus, for example, an [[outrigger canoe]] would be an anatopism in [[Madrid]].

The [[concept]] of anatopism is less widely familiar than that of [[anachronism]], perhaps because much that is anatopistic is also anachronistic.  Yet the distinction is a valid one; not all that is anatopistic is necessarily also anachronistic. 

The online ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' gives a [[synonym]] for "anatopism":  ''anachorism'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''ana-'' + ''khōros'', "place"):  "a geographical misplacement; something located in an incongruent position".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/anachorism).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Examples==
[[Catherine Hardwicke]]'s 2006 film ''[[The Nativity Story]]'' shows a field of [[maize]] in a [[Nazareth]] farming scene.  Maize is native to [[Mesoamerica]], not to the [[Middle East]], and in [[pre-Columbian]] times was grown only in the [[Americas]].  The use of maize in this film is an anatopism as well as an anachronism.

The same anatopism appears in the first part ("The Warrior Pharaohs") of a three-part 2002 [[PBS]] documentary series on "Egypt's Golden Empire" depicting the history of [[ancient Egypt]]'s [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]:  ears of [[maize]] corn are shown in a scene recreating the [[Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC)|battle and siege of Megiddo]] in the 15th century BCE.

[[Ridley Scott]]'s 2000 film, ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', set in 180 CE, features Roman soldiers riding horses using [[saddle]]s with [[stirrup]]s.  While the Romans had had saddles since about 100 BCE, and stirrups had existed in the world since about 700 BCE, stirrups did not appear in Europe until about the 6th or 7th century CE, making them both anatopic and anachronistic.

[[John Ford]]'s much-lauded 1939 film [[Stagecoach (1939 film)|''Stagecoach'']] was filmed in [[Monument Valley]] on the [[Arizona]]-[[Utah]] border, but textually set in southern Arizona and southern [[New Mexico]]. The vegetation and topography of Monument Valley and the lower-altitude deserts are vastly different, rendering the film's actual location notably anatopic. 

The [[Poland|Polish]] writer [[Bolesław Prus]], for the sake of making a point, introduces into chapter 63 of his [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', set in the [[ancient Egypt]] of 1087–1085 BCE, a substance that behaves like [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', pp. 579-81.&lt;/ref&gt;  This appears to be both an anachronism and an anatopism, since gunpowder is thought to have been invented, some time later, in [[China]] or in [[Arab world|Arabia]].  Another apparent anatopism introduced by the author (in chapter 45) is an object that resembles a [[telescope]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; that may also be an [[anachronism]].

An '''arpent''' ({{IPA-fr|aʁpɑ̃}}) is a unit of [[length]] and a unit of [[area]]. It is a pre-[[Metric system|metric]] [[French units of measurement|French unit]] based on the Roman [[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Length|''actus'']]. It is used in [[Quebec]], some areas of the [[United States customary units|United States]] that were part of [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]], and in [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]].

==Etymology==

The word ''arpent'' is believed to derive from the [[Late Latin]] ''arepennis'' (equal to half a ''[[jugerum]]''), which in turn comes from the [[Gaulish]] *''are-penno''- ("end, extremity of a field").

==Unit of length==

There were various standard arpents. The most common were the arpent used in North America, which was defined as 180 [[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution#Length|French feet]] (''{{lang|fr|pied}}'', of approximately {{convert|32.48|cm|in|disp=or}}), and the arpent used in Paris, which was defined as 220 French feet.

* In North America, 1 arpent = 180 French feet = about 192 [[English foot|English feet]] = about 58.47 [[metre]]s
* In Paris, 1 arpent = 220 French feet = about 234 English feet = about 71.46 metres

==Unit of area==

Historically, in North America, 1 (square) arpent (''{{lang|fr|arpent carré}}''), also known as a French acre, was 180 French feet × 180 French feet = 32,400 French square feet = about 3419 [[square metre]]s = about 0.845 English [[acre]]s.  Certain U.S. states have official definitions of the arpent which vary slightly:
* In [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Florida]], the official conversion is 1 arpent = {{convert|0.84628|acre|m2|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;In Louisiana, an arpent is equal to approximately 0.84628 acre; see ''Derouen v. Poirier'', 136 So. 2d 131, footnote 1 (La. 3d Cir. Ct. App. 1961) (''dicta'').&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], the official conversion is 1 arpent = {{convert|0.8507|acre|m2|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Glossary of Geology|editor1=Julia A. Jackson |editor2=James P. Mehl |editor3=Klaus K. E. Neuendorf |publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9780922152766|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfnSesBc-RgC&amp;pg=PA37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, the square arpent was 220 French feet × 220 French feet = 48,400 French square feet, about {{convert|5107|m2|acre|disp=or}}.

In Mauritius and Seychelles, an arpent is about 4220.87 [[square metre]]s, 0.4221 hectares, 1.043 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mauritius: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix|publisher=International Monetary Fund|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wqUP-8z25CoC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=mauritius+arpent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q5ME0mHg9h&amp;sig=Q6Npl1Drm-w208E2RC_Y6jm6d_g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9uIKjvYPWAhUHz2MKHcw9ApYQ6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=mauritius%20arpent&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louisiana==
In Louisiana, parcels of land known as ''arpent'' sections or French ''arpent'' land grants also pre-date the [[Public Land Survey System]] (PLSS), but are treated as PLSS sections. An ''arpent'' is a French measurement of approximately {{convert|192|ft|m}}, and a square arpent (also referred to as an ''arpent'') is about {{convert|0.84|acre|m2}}.

French arpent land divisions are long narrow parcels of land, also called [[ribbon farm|ribbon farms]], usually found along the navigable streams of southern Louisiana, and also found along major waterways in other areas. This system of land subdivision was begun by French settlers in the 18th century, according to typical French practice at the time and was continued by both the Spanish and by the American government after the acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase. A typical French arpent land division is 2 to 4 arpents wide along the river by 40 to 60 arpents deep, while the Spanish arpent land divisions tend to be 6 to 8 arpents wide by 40 arpents deep.

This method of land division provided each land-owner with river frontage as well as land suitable for cultivation and habitation. These areas are given numbers just like standard sections, although the section numbers frequently exceed the normal upper limit of 36.&lt;ref name="natlatlas"&gt;[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_plss.html The Public Land Survey System (PLSS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511182116/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_plss.html |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Diener''' (11 December 1862 in [[Vienna]] &amp;ndash; 6 January 1928, Vienna) was an Austrian [[geographer]], [[geologist]] and [[paleontologist]].

== Biography ==
In 1883 he received his doctorate from the [[University of Vienna]], where his instructors included [[Eduard Suess]] and [[Melchior Neumayr]]. In 1893 he changed his [[venia legendi]] from geography to geology, a subject that he became an associate professor of in 1897. In 1906 he was named a full professor of paleontology at the University of Vienna.&lt;ref name=DB&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd116103256.html Diener, Carl] Deutsche Biographie&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best remembered for his geological (including [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]]) and faunistic investigations of the [[Alps]]. He also conducted important research on his numerous travels worldwide &amp;mdash; [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] (1885), the [[Pyrenees]] (1886), the [[Himalayas]] (1892), [[Svalbard]] (1893), the [[Urals]] and the [[Caucasus]] (1897), [[North America]] (1901), et al.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt; In 1895, with [[Wilhelm Heinrich Waagen]], he proposed the [[Anisian Stage]] (a division of the [[Middle Triassic]]) as a replacement for the "Alpine Muschelkalk".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v4d0T-L0HaAC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=Anisian+Waagen+Diener&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=69fHodeu8D&amp;sig=rEGaEkmh5NG30pTeBjB_-O0Eww0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTsaKij_3JAhXjj4MKHY5-ABEQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Anisian%20Waagen%20Diener&amp;f=false Biostratigraphic Classification of the Marine Triassic in North America] by Norman John Silberling, Edward T.

He was an avid mountaineer, and for a number of years was president of the [[Österreichischer Alpenverein]] (Austrian Alpine Club). He was also a member of the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;

== Published works ==
With [[Viktor Uhlig]], [[Rudolf Hoernes]] and Eduard Suess, he was co-author of the four-part ''Bau und bild Österreichs'' (1903), of which Diener wrote Part 2: ''Bau und bild der Ostalpen und des Karstgebietes'' (Construction and image of the eastern Alps and the [[karst]] areas).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/bau-und-bild-osterreichs/oclc/11134829 OCLC WorldCat] Bau und bild Österreichs&lt;/ref&gt; He also made major contributions to the paleontological [[bibliography]], ''Fossilium Catalogus'' (1913 &amp;ndash;).&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Fossilium_catalogus Fossilium Catalogus] de.Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; Diener's other noteworthy written efforts include:

{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
The '''carrying capacity''' of a biological [[species]] in an [[natural environment|environment]] is the maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain indefinitely, given the food, [[habitat]], [[drinking water|water]], and other [[Resource|necessities available]] in the environment. 
In [[population biology]], carrying capacity is defined as the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]'s maximal load,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hui | first1 = C | year = 2006 | title = Carrying capacity, population equilibrium, and environment's maximal load | url = | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 192 | issue = | pages = 317–320 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2005.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is different from the [[concept]] of population equilibrium. Its effect on [[population dynamics]] may be approximated in a [[logistic function|logistic model]], although this simplification ignores the possibility of [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot]] which real systems may exhibit.

Carrying capacity was originally used to determine the number of animals that could graze on a segment of land without destroying it.  Later, the idea was expanded to more complex populations, like humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carrying Capacity|url=http://www.sustainablescale.org/ConceptualFramework/UnderstandingScale/MeasuringScale/CarryingCapacity.aspx|website=The Sustainable Scale Project|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[human population]], more complex variables such as [[sanitation]] and [[Health care|medical care]] are sometimes considered as part of the necessary establishment. As population density increases, [[birth rate]] often increases and [[death rate]] typically decreases. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is the "natural increase". The carrying capacity could support a positive natural increase or could require a negative natural increase. Thus, the carrying capacity is the number of individuals an environment can support without significant negative impacts to the given organism and its environment. Below carrying capacity, populations typically increase, while above, they typically decrease. A factor that keeps population size at equilibrium is known as a [[regulating factor]]. [[Population decline|Population size decreases]] above carrying capacity due to a range of factors depending on the [[species]] concerned, but can include insufficient [[space]], [[Food security|food supply]], or [[sunlight]]. The carrying capacity of an [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] may vary for different species and may change over time due to a variety of factors including: [[Food security|food availability]], [[water supply]], environmental conditions and living space.
The origins of the term "carrying capacity" are uncertain, with researchers variously stating that it was used "in the context of international [[shipping]]"&lt;ref name="informaworld.com"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sayre |first1=N. F. |year=2008 |title=The Genesis, History, and Limits of Carrying Capacity |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=98 |issue= |pages=120–134 |publisher= |doi= 10.1080/00045600701734356|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a791001773&amp;db=all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that it was first used during 19th-century laboratory experiments with micro-organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerer, K.S., [http://dusk.geo.orst.edu/prosem/PDFs/human_geog.pdf "Human Geography and the "New Ecology": The Prospect of Promise and Integration"], ''Annals of the Assoc. of American Geo.'', '''84'''(1), 108–125, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review finds the first use of the term in an 1845 report by the [[US Secretary of State]] to the [[US Senate]].&lt;ref name="informaworld.com"/&gt;

Several estimates of the carrying capacity have been made with a wide range of population numbers. A 2001 UN report said that two-thirds of the estimates fall in the range of 4 billion to 16 billion with unspecified standard errors, with a median of about 10 billion.&lt;ref name="UN World Population Report 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpm/wpm2001.pdf|format=PDF|title=UN World Population Report 2001|page=31|accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent estimates are much lower, particularly if [[resource depletion|non-renewable resource depletion]] and [[Overconsumption|increased consumption]] are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in habitat quality or human behavior at any time might increase or reduce carrying capacity. In the view of [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul and Anne Ehrlich]], "for earth as a whole (including those parts of it we call Australia and the United States), human beings are far above carrying capacity today."&lt;ref name=Nineveh-Book/&gt;

The application of the concept of carrying capacity for the [[human population]] has been criticized for not successfully capturing the multi-layered processes between humans and the environment, which have a nature of fluidity and [[non-equilibrium]], and for sometimes being employed in a [[Victim blaming|blame-the-victim]] framework.&lt;ref name=Cliggett&gt;Cliggett, L., "Carrying Capacity's New Guise: Folk Models for Public Debate and Longitudinal Study of Environmental Change", ''[[Africa Today]]'', '''48'''(1), 2-19, (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Although the quote may be good the author doesn't reference anything when making it [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-80493292/carrying-capacity-new-guise.html 1]--&gt;  

Supporters of the concept argue that the idea of a limited carrying capacity is just as valid applied to humans as when applied to any other species. Animal population size, living standards, and resource depletion vary, but the concept of carrying capacity still applies. The number of people is not the only factor in the carrying capacity of Earth. [[Waste]] and [[over-consumption]], especially by wealthy and near-wealthy people and nations, are also putting significant strain on the environment together with [[human overpopulation]]. Population and consumption together appear to be at the core of many human problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/consumption_dwarfs_population_as_main_environmental_threat/2140/|title=Consumption Dwarfs Population as Main Environmental Threat|date=2009-04-13|publisher=Yale University|author=Fred Pearce|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nineveh-Book&gt;{{citation

===Factors that govern carrying capacity===
Some aspects of a system's carrying capacity may involve matters such as available supplies of [[food supply|food]], [[water supply|water]], raw materials, and/or other similar resources. In addition, there are other factors that govern carrying capacity which may be less instinctive or less intuitive in nature, such as ever-increasing and/or ever-accumulating levels of [[waste]]s, [[environmental damage|damage]], and/or eradication of essential components of any complex functioning system.  Eradication of, for example, large or critical portions of any [[complex system]] (envision a space vehicle, for instance, or an airplane, or an automobile, or computer code, or the body components of a living vertebrate) can interrupt essential processes and dynamics in ways that induce systems failures or unexpected collapse. (As an example of these latter factors, the "carrying capacity" of a complex system such an airplane is more than a matter of available food, or water, or available seating, but also reflects total weight carried and presumes that its passengers do not damage, destroy, or eradicate parts, [[Door|doors]], windows, wings, engine parts, fuel, and oil, and so forth.) Thus, on a global scale, food and similar resources may affect planetary carrying capacity to some extent so long as Earth's human passengers do not dismantle, eradicate, or otherwise destroy critical [[biosphere|biospheric]] life-support capacities for essential processes of self-maintenance, [[self-perpetuation]], and [[self-repair mechanisms|self-repair]].

Thus, carrying capacity interpretations that focus solely on resource limitations alone (such as food) may neglect wider functional factors.  If the humans neither gain nor lose weight in the long-term, the calculation is fairly accurate. If the quantity of food is invariably equal to the "Y" amount, carrying capacity has been reached. Humans, with the need to enhance their reproductive success (see Richard Dawkins' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''{{Verify source|date=May 2009}}&lt;!-- the gene-centric model of evolution is disputed, in particular in sentient species. Contrast with the Expanded Phenotype, also by Dawkins --&gt;), understand that food supply can vary and also that other factors in the environment can alter humans' need for food. A house, for example, might mean that one does not need to eat as much to stay warm as one otherwise would. Over time, monetary transactions have replaced barter and local production, and consequently modified local human carrying capacity. However, purchases also impact regions thousands of miles away. For example, [[carbon dioxide]] from an [[automobile]] travels to the upper atmosphere. This led [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] to develop the [[I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PAT]] equation.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, P.R., Holdren, J.P., "Impact of Population Growth", [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], '''171'''(3977), 1212–1217, (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{math|1=''I'' = ''P'' ∙ ''A'' ∙ ''T''}}
where:
: ''I'' is the impact on the environment resulting from consumption
: ''P'' is the population number
: ''A'' is the consumption per capita (affluence)
: ''T'' is the technology factor
[[File:Logistic curve examples.png|thumb|This is a graph of the population due to the logistic curve model.  When the population is above the carrying capacity it decreases, and when it is below the carrying capacity it increases.]]
An important model related to carrying capacity (K), is the logistic, growth curve. The logistic growth curve depicts a more realistic version of how population growth rate, available resources, and the carrying capacity are inter-connected. As illustrated in the logistic growth curve model, when the population size is small and there are many resources available, population over-time increases and so does the growth rate. However, as population size nears the carrying capacity and resources become limited, the growth rate decreases and population starts to level out at K. This model is based on the assumption that carrying capacity does not change. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that carrying capacity of a population can increase or decrease and there are various factors that affect it. For instance, an increase in the population growth can lead to over-exploitation of necessary natural resources and therefore decrease the overall carrying capacity of that environment.&lt;ref&gt;Swafford, Angela Lynn.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology can play a role in the dynamics of carrying capacity and while this can sometimes be positive,&lt;ref&gt;Martire, S., Castellani, V., &amp; Sala, S. (2015). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.11.002 Carrying capacity assessment of forest resources: Enhancing environmental sustainability in energy production at local scale] Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 94, 11-20. doi: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.11.002]&lt;/ref&gt; in other cases its influence can be problematic. For example, it has been suggested that in the past that the [[Neolithic]] revolution increased the carrying capacity of the world relative to humans through the invention of agriculture.  In a similar way, viewed from the perspective of foods, the use of [[fossil fuel]]s has been alleged to artificially increase the carrying capacity of the world by the use of stored sunlight, even though that food production does not guarantee the capacity of the Earth's climatic and [[Biosphere|biospheric]] life-support systems to withstand the damage and wastes arising from such fossil fuels.  However, such interpretations presume the continued and uninterrupted functioning of all other critical components of the global system.  It has also been suggested that other technological advances that have increased the carrying capacity of the world relative to humans are: [[polder]]s, [[fertilizer]], [[composting]], [[greenhouse]]s, [[land reclamation]], and [[fish farming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} In an adverse way, however, many technologies enable economic entities and individual humans to inflict far more damage and eradication, far more quickly and efficiently on a wider-scale than ever. Examples include machine guns, chainsaws, earth-movers, and the capacity of industrialized fishing fleets to capture and harvest targeted fish species faster than the fish themselves can reproduce are examples of such problematic outcomes of technology.

[[Agricultural capability]] on Earth expanded in the last quarter of the 20th century. But now there are many projections of a continuation of the decline in world agricultural capability (and hence carrying capacity) which began in the 1990s. Most conspicuously, China's food production is forecast to decline by 37% by the last half of the 21st century, placing a strain on the entire carrying capacity of the world, as China's population could expand to about 1.5 billion people by the year 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Economy, E., ''China vs. Earth'', The Nation, May 7, 2007 issue&lt;/ref&gt; This reduction in China's agricultural capability (as in other world regions) is largely due to the world [[water crisis]] and especially due to mining [[groundwater]] beyond sustainable yield, which has been happening in China since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, R., ''The Little Green Handbook'', [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]], (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-312-42581-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lester Brown]] of the [[Earth Policy Institute]], has said: "It would take 1.5 Earths to sustain our present level of consumption. Environmentally, the world is in an [[overshoot (population)|overshoot]] mode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Ecological footprint===
One way to estimate human [[demand]] compared to ecosystem's carrying capacity is "[[ecological footprint]]" accounting. Rather than speculating about future possibilities and limitations imposed by carrying capacity constraints, Ecological Footprint accounting provides empirical, non-speculative assessments of the past. It compares historic regeneration rates, [[biocapacity]], against historical human [[demand]], [[ecological footprint]], in the same year.&lt;ref name="WS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wackernagel | first1 = M. | last2 = Schulz | first2 = N.B. | display-authors = etal |year=2002 |title="Tracking the ecological overshoot of the human economy |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/14/9266.short |journal=[[PNAS|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA]] | volume = 99 | issue = 14| pages = 9266–9271 | doi=10.1073/pnas.142033699 | pmid=12089326 | pmc=123129| bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.9266W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, W.E. and Wackernagel, M., ''Ecological Footprints and Appropriated Carrying Capacity: Measuring the Natural Capital Requirements of the Human Economy'', Jansson, A., Folke, C., Hammer, M. and Costanza R. (ed.), [[Island Press]], (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; One result shows that humanity's demand footprint in 1999 exceeded the planet's bio-capacity by &gt;20%.&lt;ref name="WS" /&gt; However, this measurement does not take into account the depletion of the actual fossil fuels, "which would result in a carbon Footprint many hundreds of times higher than the current calculation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/frequently_asked_technical_questions/|title=FAQ - Global Footprint Network|author=|date=|website=footprintnetwork.org|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also concern of the ability of countries around to globe to decrease and maintain their ecological footprints. Holden and Linnerud, scholars working to provide a better framework that adequately judge sustainability development and maintenance in policy making, have generated a diagram that measures the global position of different countries around the world, which shows a linear relation between GDP PPP and ecological foot print in 2007. Possible answers to the question of where we are as individual countries attempting to reach sustainability and development methods to reduce ecological foot print. According to the Figure 1 diagram, the United States had the largest ecological foot print per capita along with Norway, Sweden, and Austria, in comparison to Cuba, Bangladesh, and Korea. &lt;ref name="The Sustainable Development Area"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holden|first1=Erling|last2=Linnerud|first2=Kristin|title=The sustainable development area: satisfying basic needs and safeguarding ecological sustainability|journal=Sustainable Development|date=May 2007|volume=15|issue=3|pages=174–187|doi=10.1002/sd.313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{One source|date=March 2012}}
'''Cliff-top dunes''', also known as '''perched dunes''', are [[dune]]s that occur on the tops of [[cliff]]s. They are uncommon in most parts of the world, because they only develop under unusual geomorphological conditions. Processes by which they may be formed include:
* a dune advances up a pre-existing slope, which is then eroded to form a cliff;
* a dune forms during a period of high sea level, then sea level drops, exposing a cliff face.
They are most often seen as coastal landforms, but can also occur along lakes and rivers, and in deserts. Places where they are relatively common include the west coast of [[Jutland]], [[Denmark]].  They can also be found in certain places along the shores of the [[Great Lakes]] in [[Michigan]], including the Grand Sable Dunes in [[Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore]] and in the [[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore]], most dramatically on [[South Manitou Island]].

A high erodability implies that the same amount of work exerted by the [[erosion]] processes leads to a larger removal of material. Because the mechanics behind erosion depend upon the competence and coherence of the material, erodability is treated in different ways depending on the type of surface that eroded.

==Soils==
Soil erodibility is a lumped parameter that represents an integrated annual value of the soil profile reaction to the process of soil detachment and transport by raindrops and surface flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/64080530/rusle/ah_703.pdf|title=Handook of RUSLE|last=Renard|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most commonly used model for predicting soil loss from water erosion is the ''[[Universal Soil Loss Equation|Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE)]]'' (also known as the K-factor technique), which estimates the average annual soil loss &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ward, Andrew D.|author2=Trimble, Stanley W.|last-author-amp=yes|chapter=Soil conservation and sediment budgets|title=Environmental Hydrology|publisher=CRC Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-56670-616-2|page=259|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yANwmTjf588C&amp;pg=PA259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors such as the stone content (referred as ''stoniness''), which acts as protection against soil erosion, are very significant in Mediterranean countries.

==Rocks==

===Shear stress model===
Geological and experimental studies have shown that the erosion of bedrock by rivers follows in first approach the following expression&lt;ref&gt;Bagnold, R. A. (1977), Bedload transport by natural rivers, Water Resoure. Res., 13, 303–312, doi:10.1029/WR013i002p00303.&lt;/ref&gt; known as the ''shear stress model'' of [[stream power]] erosion:
:&lt;math&gt;{dz \over dt} = - K_\tau (\tau\ - \tau\ _c) ^a &lt;/math&gt;
where ''z'' is the riverbed elevation, ''t'' is time, ''K_\tau'' is the erodability, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the basal shear stress of the water flow, and ''a'' is an exponent. For a river channel with a slope ''S'' and a water depth ''D'', &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau\ = \rho\ g D S&lt;/math&gt;

Note that ''&lt;math&gt;K_\tau&lt;/math&gt;'' embeds not only mechanical properties inherent to the rock but also other factors unaccounted in the previous two equations, such as the availability of river tools (pebbles being dragged by the current) that actually produce the abrasion of the riverbed.

''&lt;math&gt;K_\tau&lt;/math&gt;'' can be measured in the lab for weak rocks, but river erosion rates in natural geological scenarios are often slower than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm/yr, and therefore the river incision must be dated over periods longer than a few thousand years to make accurate measurements. ''K&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' values range between 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; m yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Pa&lt;sup&gt;−1.5&lt;/sup&gt; for a=1.5 and 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;+4&lt;/sup&gt; m yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Pa&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for a=1.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Castellanos, D., A. Villaseñor, 2011. Messinian salinity crisis regulated by competing tectonics and erosion at the Gibraltar Arc. Nature, 480, 359-363, doi:10.1038/nature10651&lt;/ref&gt; However, the hydrological conditions in these time scales are usually poorly constrained, impeding a good the quantification of ''D''.

===Unit stream power model===
An alternative model for bedrock erosion is the ''unit stream power'', which assumes that erosion rates are proportional to the potential energy loss of the water per unit area:
:&lt;math&gt;{dz \over dt} = - K_\omega\ \omega\ &lt;/math&gt;
where ''&lt;math&gt;K_\omega&lt;/math&gt;'' is the erodability, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the unit stream power, which is easily calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega\ = \rho\ g Q S / W&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Q'' is the water discharge of the river [m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s], and ''W'' is the width of the river channel [m].

Relative differences in long-term erodability can be estimated by quantifying the erosion response under similar climatic and topographic conditions with different rock lithology.&lt;ref&gt;Hooke, Rohrer, 1977 - Relative erodibility of source-area rock types, as determined from second-order variations in alluvial-fan size, Geological Society of America Bulletin, v. 88, p. 1177-1182, 4 figs., August 1977, Doc. no. 70815&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3691">'''Fan Chengda''' ({{zh|c=范成大|p=Fàn Chéngdà|w='''Fan Ch'eng-ta'''}}, 1126–1193), [[courtesy name]] '''Zhineng''' (致能), was one of the best-known Chinese poets of the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 AD), a government official, and an academic authority in [[geography]], especially the southern provinces of [[China]]. His written work also falls under the literary category of 'travel record literature' (youji wenxue), a [[narrative]] and [[prose]] style approach to writing about one's travel experiences, which was popular in China during the Song Dynasty.&lt;ref name="hargett 67 68"&gt;Hargett, 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Fàn was a member of a cadet branch of the elite [[Fan (surname)|Fàn family]]. 

==Life and works==

Fàn's work deals with the traditional themes of the period, including peasant life, the seasons,  [[Buddhism]], and growing old. Fàn was born in [[Suzhou]] into a middle-ranking family at a [[Jurchen campaigns against the Song Dynasty|time of conflict]] between the [[Southern Song]] and [[Jin Dynasty, 1115–1234|Jin]] dynasties. A precocious child, his early studies of classical literature prepared him for a career in the civil service - a career that was temporarily interrupted when his parents died within a few months of each other in 1143, leaving Fàn Chengda in sole charge of the family estate. These studies, together with his experiences of working in the fields as a teenager and his interest in Buddhism, provided inspiration for his later poetry.

After a youth of austere poverty, Fàn Chengda was able to pass the [[Imperial Examination]] and secure the [[Jinshi (imperial examination)|jinshi]] degree in 1154 AD. Afterwards he entered a long career in service of the state. During his career he wrote an important [[geographical]] treatise known as the ''Gui Hai Yu Heng Chi''. The book focused primarily on the [[topography]] of the land and commercial products of China's southern provinces.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 510"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 510.&lt;/ref&gt; In this Fàn followed a long geographical literary tradition, continuing from the ''Shu Jing'' (''Historical Classic'') of the 5th century BC, the ''Huainan Zi'' of the 2nd century BC, and predating the famous written works by the [[Ming Dynasty]] geographer [[Xu Xiake]].

However, his best-known work is a series of sixty poems which he wrote in 1186, following his retirement from his position as a high official at the Southern Song Court. The poems have been translated into English under the name ''Stone Lake'' - the location of his retirement villa just outside Suzhou.

[[File:GeoFence.jpg|thumb|Two geofences defined in a GPS application]]
A '''geo-fence''' is a [[Virtuality|virtual]] [[perimeter]] for a real-world [[geographic area]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/geofencing|title=What is geo-fencing (geofencing)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|newspaper=WhatIs.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A geo-fence could be dynamically generated—as in a radius around a point location, or a geo-fence can be a predefined set of boundaries (such as school zones or neighborhood boundaries).

The use of a geo-fence is called '''geo-fencing''', and one example of usage involves a location-aware device of a [[location-based service]] (LBS) user entering or exiting a geo-fence. This activity could trigger an alert to the device's user as well as messaging to the geo-fence operator.  This info, which could contain the location of the device, could be sent to a [[mobile telephone]] or an email account.

==Applications==
Geofencing, used with [[Parental controls|child location]] services, can notify parents if a child leaves a designated area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Location Systems: An Introduction to the Technology Behind Location Awareness |last=De Lara |first=Eyal |author2=Anthony LaMarca |author3=Mahadev Satyanarayanan  |year=2008 |publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers |isbn=978-1-59829-581-8 |page=88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geofencing used with [[locationized firearms]] can restrict those firearms to fire only in locations where their firing is permitted, thereby making them unable to be used elsewhere.  

Geofencing is critical to [[telematics]].  It allows users of the system to draw zones around places of work, customer's sites and secure areas. These geo-fences when crossed by an equipped vehicle or person can trigger a warning to the user or operator via SMS or email.

In some companies, geofencing is used by the [[Human resource management|human resource]] department to monitor employees working in special locations especially those doing field works. Using a geofencing tool, an employee is allowed to log his or her attendance using a GPS-enabled device when within a designated  perimeter.

Other applications include sending an alert if a vehicle is stolen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Motorcycle Tracker Updates Every 15 Seconds |url=http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2/2304/Motorcycle-Article/Motorcycle-Tracker-Updates-Every-15-Seconds.aspx |work=Motorcycle USA |date=23 January 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and notifying rangers when wildlife stray into farmland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenya's elephants send text messages to rangers |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/11/tech/main4515365.shtml |work=[[CBS News]] |date=11 February 2009 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Geo-fence can be used for location based messaging for tourist safety and communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ugoround.com/white_papers/UgoRound-White-Paper-Location-based-messaging-for-Tourists.pdf |title=Location Based Messaging for Tourist Safety and Communication |publisher=UgoRound.com |date=3 July 2017 |accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geofencing, in a security strategy model, provides security to wireless local area networks. This is done by using predefined borders (e.g., an office space with borders established by positioning technology attached to a specially programmed server). The office space becomes an authorized location for designated users and wireless mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;Hamid Jahankhani, A G Hessami, Feng Hsu: Global security, safety, and sustainability : 5th international conference, ICGS3 2009, London, UK, September 1-2, 2009 : proceedings. {{ISBN|978-3-642-04061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One expert in [[global positioning system]] security, and a politician, has suggested that government regulators should encourage drone manufacturers to build geofencing constraints into [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] navigation systems that would override the commands of the unsophisticated operator, preventing the device from flying into protected [[airspace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Todd Humphreys: Don't Overregulate Drones |url=http://alcalde.texasexes.org/2015/03/todd-humphreys-dont-overregulate-drones/ |work=Alcalde |date=18 March 2015 |accessdate=2015-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Geologic history==
Most of Austria's rocks formed in the last 540 million years, during the Phanerozoic explosion of life. Small [[zircon]] crystals, eroded out of three billion year old granites are among the few remnants of the Precambrian. Dobra Gneiss, at 1.38 billion years old, is the oldest rock in Austria within the Moldanubian Superunit in the Waldviertel region. Mica schist and phyllite were deposited between 900 and 500 million years ago.

===Cambrian===
In the Cadomian Event, fragments of continental crust such as the Bohemian Massif and the Alps joined the margin of the supercontinent Gondwana. Igneous activity occurred, in connection with small ocean basins opening. The Maissau granite, dated to 570 million years ago, in the eastern edge of the Bohemian Massif is a remnant of this igneous activity. The Austrian crustal components of Gondwana drifted into the southern hemisphere in the early Cambrian. At the end of the Cambrian, some crustal fragments separated again as microcontinents with the opening of the Rheic Ocean. The Moravian Superunit is one example of this pattern. {{sfn|Geological Survey of Austria|2014|p=50}}

===Ordovician===
Situated near the South Pole at the start of the Ordovician, the region was likely barren and nearly lifeless. The Austroalpine and South Alpine superunits formed a shelf that received clay and sand sediments from the continental interior. The Ordovician also marked a poorly understood period of igneous activity, that resulted in granites and the Blasseneck Porphyroid, a weakly metamorphosed porphyry in the Greywacke Zone, with mixed layers of pyroclastic flow and lava.

Some of the earliest fossils were deposited at the end of the Ordovician on the continental shelf, including orthocerids and cystoids. {{sfn|Geological Survey of Austria|2014|p=51}}

===Silurian-Devonian===
In the Silurian, crustal extension began, opening the Paleotethys Ocean on the northern margin of Gondwana. Basins filled with sand, clay and calcareous sediments while basalt and andesite poured out of cracks, ultimately metamorphosing into amphibolite and greenschist now found in the Austroalpine and South Alpine superunits.

Gondwana drifted northward in the Devonian and large reefs developed on the continental shelf of Austria. Island arc collisions are recorded as amphibolite and gneiss in the Sub-Pennic Superunit of the Hohe Tauern mountain range. {{sfn|Geological Survey of Austria|2014|p=51}}

With the closing of the Rheic Ocean and the western Paleotethyic Ocean, the supercontinent Pangaea took shape. Extensive erosion of mountain ranges and basin formations led to coal deposition. These coal deposits were subsequently mined in the Brenner area of Tyrol and Stangalpe in the Nockberge mountain range in Carinthia.

===Variscan Orogeny: Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic===
A major mountain range formed with the closing of the oceans, spanning thousands of kilometers across Pangaea. Known as the Variscan orogeny in Central Europe, the mountain building event left remnant highlands throughout Europe, northwestern Africa and North America. The Alps and the Bohemian Massif were affected by the orogeny. The Sub-Penninic and Moldanubian superunits were deeply buried within the new range (granulites in the Moldanubian Superunit, for instance, formed at 55 kilometers depth), while the Austroalpine superunit likely formed foothills. A tropical climate dominated the region, supporting 40 meter trees.
 
Melting occurred, forming granites now found in all the major Austrian superunits. Crustal extension began again in the Permian leading to more basalt melts, granite and pegmatite formation, which are commonly found in the South Alpine and Austroalpine Superunits. Explosive quartz-dominated volcanism took place at the surface, creating the Bozen Quartz Porphyry, which is hundreds of meters thick in South Tyrol. Crustral extension combined with erosion to reduce the height of the Variscan mountains to only a few hundred meters above sea level. Embayments of the Tethys Ocean flooded the edge of the South Alpine and Austroalpine superunits, leaving fossil-rich limestones as well as salt and gypsum deposits. The region experienced a dry climate akin to modern-day Arabia, before the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. {{sfn|Geological Survey of Austria|2014|p=52-53}}

Amidst the slower tectonic activity of the Triassic, continental sediments formed dark limestones in a poorly ventilated offshore marine environment. The ocean expanded inland, creating a large shelf environment and improved water circulation from the Tethys Ocean generated a large reef belt. Volcanic activity picked up 230 million years ago forming the South Tyrolean Dolomites and depositing ash fall on the Northern Calcareous Alps. Sandstone, gypsum and mudstone formed in near shore areas of the Sub-Pennic and Helvetic superunits. At a few spots, such as Lunz am See sand and claystones interbedded with coal.

The famous Halstatt Limestone, well known for ammonite fossils, was deposited in warm shallow water less than 100 meters deep. The Meliatic Superunit, on the other hand, preserves deep sea siliceous material formed 4000 meters below the surface of the Tethys Ocean. {{sfn|Geological Survey of Austria|2014|p=54-55}}

===Breakup of Pangaea: Jurassic-Cretaceous===
Rifts began to form within Pangaea opening the Atlantic Ocean. At first, the rifts filled with continental sediments. The Tarntal Breccia in the Austroalpine Superunit preserves tectonic rock fracturing. A fault opened to the west, forming the Penninic Ocean. Deep plumes of mantle rock reached the surface, interacting with seawater to become serpentinite.

Central Europe formed the northwestern margin of the Penninic Ocean. Permian and Triassic sediments emerged above sea level on the Moldanubian, Moravian, Helvetic and Sub-Penninc superunits. As the Tethys Ocean crust began to subduct, only small fragments of its crust remained in the Meliatic Superunit in the Eastern Alps. The Tethys Ocean closed in the Dinarides and Hellenides in the late Cretaceous. 
The formation of the Alps started 135 million years ago at a strike-slip fault between the Penninic and Tethys Ocean. The Northern Calcareous Alps and Gurktal Alps formed as an orogenic wedge as sedimentary rocks were torn of basement rock that was subducted back into the mantle. The crust of the Penninic Ocean subducted around 85 million years ago. Deep water sediments accumulated due to earthquake related submarine landslides. Some rock units were dragged underneath the Radstadter Tauern and Semmering mountains. {{sfn|Geological Survey of Austria|2014|p=58-60}}

===Cenozoic: Paleogene-Neogene===
The Penninic Ocean fully closed and subducted 50 million years ago, although sections of orogenic rock were thrust onto the Helvetic Shelf. Nappes in the South Alpine Superunit formed as the unstable Adriatic Plate shifted northward into the Helvetic Shelf. The building of the Alps continued, as some units subsided 60 kilometers below the surface, metamorphosing under high pressure. Eclogite and blueschist in the Sub-Penninic Superunit and Penninic Superunit are seen as evidence of the extent of metamorphism.
 
Igneous activity formed tonalite, granite and basalt between five and 25 kilometers depth, while volcanoes were active on the surface. Volcanic clasts in the Molasse Zone of Upper Bavaria and Salzburg evidence the presence of the volcanoes, which subsequently eroded. The eastern part of the Northern Calcareous Alps was part of an alluvial river plain, which explains the crystalline pebbles now located on high plateaus.

The area by the edge of the Alps was pushed down by the weight of the orogenic wedge, forming a foreland basin, which flooded around 34 million years—becoming the inland Molasse Sea from France to Central Asia. Also known as the Paratethys, the new sea hosted rich fauna, including whales, sharks, manatees, mussels, seaweed and bladder wrack, and formed the Schoeneck Fish Shale, an important petroleum source rock. The basin silted up 17 million years ago and shifted to freshwater deposition, which were then worn away seven million years ago.

Beginning 23 million years ago, the Adriatic Plate continued to approach the Eurasian Plate, resulting in crustal shortening and extended the orogenic eastward, creating the Styrian, Carpathian, Pannonian and Vienna basins. The greatest shortening and compression is found in the vicinity of the Hohe Tauern mountains, forming large crystals and epidote in rock cracks. Water and ice eroded tectonically fractured rocks beginning 17 million years ago, creating deep Alpine valleys.

Along strike-slip faults, the Koralpe and Saualpe mountain ranges were uplifted and tilted to the east. Elsewhere, intramontane basins such as Fohnsdorf, Tamsweg and Lavantall formed, accumulating mountain debris and coal. The Molasse Sea-Paratethys Ocean extended into the Vienna, Styrian and Pannonian basins, which became isolated as the Pannonian Lake 12 million years ago.

Volcanoes were active until 15 million years ago, as a result of volatiles subducted with the Penninic Ocean crust melting rock, found in Bad Gleichenberg and Weitendorf, villages both in Styria. Basalts erupted at Mount Pauliberg, approximately 11 million years ago and small basalt flows erupted into the early Quaternary. {{sfn|Geological Survey of Austria|2014|p=61-66}}

===Quaternary===
Quaternary glaciation began in the Alps 870,000 years ago and advanced to the Alpine Foreland 650,000 years ago. In the Alps, the four glaciations are known by the names of Bavarian rivers: Gunz, Mindel, Riss and Wurm. The Wurm glaciation is the most recent and best preserved, ending 11,700 years ago. Sedimentary terraces up to 300 meters thick formed rapidly in the Inn Valley due to glaciation. The Vienna basin filled with loose material created by frost shatter and moved by partial melting of permafrost and high winds. Although a warming period 20,000 years ago rapidly melted the glaciers, they advanced again 16,000 and 12,000 years ago. {{sfn|Geological Survey of Austria|2014|p=67-68}}

==Structural &amp; tectonic geology==
The Salzach-Enns-Mariazell-Puchberg Fault (SEMP) is the largest in the Northern Calcareous Alsps. The Pols, Lavant, Mur, Murz, Isel and Moll valleys are all examples of strike-slip faults.
The Periadriatic Fault, in the Gail Valley into the Karawanken mountains creates the border between the Eastern and Southern Alps. Nappes in the Penninic and Sub-Penninic superunits are exposed through normal faults such as the Lower Engadine Window, Tauern Window and Rechnitz Window. {{sfn|Geological Survey of Austria|2014|p=85}}

==Natural resource geology==
Copper ores have been mined from the Austrian Graywacke Zone since prehistoric times. Salt mining in the Northern Calcareous Alps began in the Salzkammergut (Hallstatt) in Late Permian deposits in the Bronze Age, along with iron deposits.

By the early 1990s, mining had largely ceased in Austria except for 980,000 tons of sparry magnesite extracted in 1991 and some mining of [[siderite]], lead-zinc sulfides and [[antimonite]]. At the time, small occurrences of kaolinite, talc, graphite, mica, rock salt, gypsum and anhydrite were also mined.

In 1930, Neogene hydrocarbon extraction began in the Vienna Basin, with subsequent discoveries in the Molasse Zone of Upper Austria—by 1991, 1.3 billion cubic meters of gas and 1.16 metric tons of oil were produced. The Styrian Basin holds low-grade lignite coal. Due to its underlying karst landscape, Austria typically has high quality groundwater.

==History of geologic research==
Geologic research began in the 18th century, spurred on by the work of individual naturalists. "Mineralogical and botanical pleasure trip from Mount Terglou in Krain, to Mount Glokner in Tyrol in the year 1779 and 1781," published in 1783, is recognized as the first book on Austrian geology. In 1835, a Museum of Mining was established in Vienna, through the Imperial and Royal Geological Office. Ritter von Haidinger founded the bureau, which launched a systematic survey of Austro-Hungary in 1849. Edward Suess became Austria's first professor of geology and paleontology in the 1850s. In the second half of  the 19th century, new geology departments were established at University of Graz and University of Innsbruck. Climbers from the Austrian Alpine Club recognized ammonite fossils, gaining a greater understanding of Alpine geology. {{sfn|Geological Survey of Austria|2014|p=5}}

The '''golden age of alpinism''' was the decade in [[mountaineering]] between [[Alfred Wills]]'s ascent of the [[Wetterhorn]] in 1854&lt;ref&gt;Though Wills thought he had made a first ascent, the Wetterhorn had been climbed in 1844, and his was the fourth ascent.

==Prominent figures==
With its beginning slightly predating the formation of the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]] in London in 1857, the golden age was dominated by British alpinists and their Swiss and French guides. Prominent figures of the period include [[Lord Francis Douglas]], [[Paul Grohmann]], [[Florence Crauford Grove]], [[Charles Hudson (climber)|Charles Hudson]], [[Edward Shirley Kennedy|E. S. Kennedy]], [[William Mathews (mountaineer)|William Mathews]], [[Adolphus Warburton Moore|A. W. Moore]], [[Leslie Stephen]], [[Francis Fox Tuckett]], [[John Tyndall]], [[Horace Walker]] and [[Edward Whymper]]. Well-known guides of the era include [[Christian Almer]], [[Jakob Anderegg]], [[Melchior Anderegg]], {{illm|Johann Joseph Benet|de||es|Johann Joseph Bennen|fr|Johann Joseph Bennen}}, {{illm|Peter Bohren|de||fr|}}, [[Jean-Antoine Carrel]], [[Michel Croz]], {{illm|Ulrich Kaufmann|de|Ulrich Kaufmann (Bergführer)|fr||pt|}} and Johannes Zumtaugwald.

Walker's sister [[Lucy Walker (climber)|Lucy]] also attained some notable firsts during the period, including the first ascent of the [[Balmhorn]] (1864), and later several first female ascents.

In the early years of the "[[golden age]]", scientific pursuits were intermixed with the sport. More often than not, the mountaineers carried a variety of instruments up the mountain with them to be used for scientific observations. The physicist [[John Tyndall]] was the most prominent of the scientists. Among the non-scientist mountaineers, the literary critic [[Leslie Stephen]] was the most prominent. In the later years of the "golden age", the non-scientist pure sportsmen came to dominate the London-based Alpine Club and alpine mountaineering overall.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Eliane Engel (1950), ''A History of Mountaineering in the Alps'', chapter VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sunset at Long Beach (South Africa).jpg|thumb|Golden hour at Long Beach in [[South Africa]]]]
In [[photography]], the '''golden hour''' is the period of [[daytime]] shortly after [[sunrise]] or before [[sunset]], during which [[daylight]] is redder and [[hard and soft light|softer]] than when the [[Sun]] is higher in the [[sky]]. The opposite period during [[twilight]] is [[blue hour]], just [[dawn|before sunrise]] or [[dusk|after sunset]], when indirect [[sunlight]] is evenly [[photon diffusion|diffused]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Edward |last1=Pincus |first2=Steven |last2=Ascher |title=The Filmmaker’s Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide for the Digital Age |location=New York |publisher=[[Plume (publisher)|Plume]] |year=2012 |page=517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
[[file:PlanckianLocus.png|thumb|upright|The [[color temperature]] of [[daylight]] varies with the time of day. It tends to be around 2,000 K shortly after [[sunrise]] or before [[sunset]], around 3,500 K during "golden hour", and around 5,500 K during [[noon|midday]]. The color temperature can also change significantly with [[altitude]], [[latitude]], and weather conditions).]]

When the [[Sun]] is low above the [[horizon]], [[sunlight]] rays must penetrate the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] for a [[air mass (astronomy)|greater distance]], [[Extinction (astronomy)#Atmospheric extinction|reducing]] the intensity of the [[key light|direct light]], so that more of the [[diffuse sky radiation|illumination]] comes from [[fill light|indirect light]] from the sky (Thomas 1973, 9–13), reducing the [[lighting ratio]]. More blue light is [[Rayleigh scattering|scattered]], so if the Sun is present, its light appears more reddish. In addition, the Sun's [[horizontal coordinate system|low angle]] above the horizon produces longer shadows.

The term ''hour'' is used figuratively; the effect has no clearly defined duration and varies according to season and latitude. The character of the lighting is determined by the sun's [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]], and the time for the Sun to move from the horizon to a specified altitude depends on a location's [[latitude]] and the time of year (Bermingham 2003, 214). In [[Los Angeles, California]], at an hour after sunrise or an hour before [[sunset]], the sun has an altitude of about 10–12°.&lt;ref&gt;Solar altitude in Los Angeles, CA, at 1 hour after sunrise computed for 21 March, 21 June, 21 September, and 21 December 2009 using the [[USNO|U.S. Naval Observatory]] [http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/data-services Data Services] [http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/data-services/alt-az-us Altitude and Azimuth of the sun or Moon During One Day] on 30 July 2009. Values obtained were 11.7°, 10.5°, 11.7°, and 9.75°.&lt;/ref&gt; For a location closer to the [[Equator]], the same altitude is reached in less than an hour, and for a location farther from the equator, the altitude is reached in more than one hour. For a location sufficiently far from the equator, the Sun may not reach an altitude of 10°, and the golden hour lasts for the entire day in certain seasons.

In the middle of the day, the bright overhead Sun can create strong highlights and dark [[shadow]]s. The degree to which [[exposure (photography)|overexposure]] can occur varies because different types of film and digital cameras have different [[dynamic range]]s.
This harsh lighting problem is particularly important in portrait photography, where a [[fill flash]] is often necessary to balance lighting across the subject's face or body, filling in strong shadows that are usually considered undesirable.

Because the contrast is less during the golden hour, shadows are less dark, and highlights are less likely to be overexposed. In [[landscape photography]], the warm color of the low Sun is often considered desirable to enhance the colours of the scene. It is the best time of day for any type of photography since the light is properly diffused and warm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.photographyaxis.com/photography-articles/35-best-sunset-photography-tips-ideas/|title=35 Best Sunset Photography Tips and Ideas - PhotographyAxis|date=2018-08-02|work=PhotographyAxis|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub''' is a [[deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric shrubland]] [[ecoregion]] in [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], covering an estimated area of {{convert|150000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Rainfall varies from {{convert|125|to|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the median temperature is {{convert|26|C|F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="EoEarth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/153168/ |first=Mark |last=McGinley |title=Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub |publisher=Encyclopedia of Earth |date=2012-08-02 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:Ranchería Wayúu.JPG|thumb|left|A [[wayuu]] rancheria. The wayuu people are the native inhabitants of the Guajira xeric scrub]]
The ecoregion occupies the [[Guajira Peninsula]], the valley of [[Rancheria river]] and [[Guajira Department]], covering parts of the northeastern coast of [[Venezuela]]. The valleys lie in the [[rain shadow]] of the surrounding [[Serranía de Macuira]], which reaches an elevation of {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}} over sea level. These mountains trap some of the trade winds, causing [[mist]]. An important tourist destination in the area is [[Cabo de la Vela]].

== Ecology ==
{{see also|Biodiversity in Colombia}}
=== Flora ===
[[File:Dividivi on aruba.jpg|thumb|Divi-divi (''[[Caesalpinia coriaria]]'')]]
The ecoregion is dominated by thorny trees and [[succulent]]s. Common species include ''[[Acacia glomerosa]]'', ''[[Bourreria cumanensis]]'', ''[[Bulnesia arborea]]'', ''[[Caesalpinia coriaria]]'', ''[[Copaifera venezolana]]'', ''[[Croton (plant)|Croton]]'' sp., ''[[Gyrocarpus americanus]]'', ''[[Hyptis]]'' sp., ''[[Jacquinia pungens]]'', ''[[Malpighia glabra]]'', ''[[Myrospermum frutescens]]'', ''[[Opuntia caribaea]]'', ''[[Pereskia guamacho]]'', ''[[Piptadenia flava]]'', ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'', and ''[[Stenocereus griseus]]''.
[[File:Wajiiraka.jpg|thumb|right]]
Forests dominated by ''[[Lonchocarpus punctatus]]'' are often accompanied by ''[[Bunchosia odorata]]'' and ''[[Ayenia magna]]''. Other forests exist in which ''Prosopis juliflora'', ''[[Erythrina velutina]]'' and ''[[Clerodendron ternifolium]]'' are dominant. A variety of plant communities occur where two plant species are dominant. Examples include ''[[Astronium graveolens]]'' &amp;ndash; ''[[Handroanthus billbergii]]'', ''[[Haematoxylum brasiletto]]'' &amp;ndash; ''[[Melochia tomentosa]]'', ''Caesalpinia coriaria'' &amp;ndash; ''[[Cordia curassavica]]'', ''[[Bursera glabra]]'' &amp;ndash; ''[[Castela erecta]]'', ''[[Vitex cymosa]]'' &amp;ndash; ''[[Libidibia coraria]]'', ''[[Mimosa cabrera]]'' &amp;ndash; ''Cordia curassavica'', ''[[Bursera tomentosa]]'' &amp;ndash; ''[[Bursera graveolens]]'' and ''[[Castela erecta]]'' &amp;ndash; ''[[Parkinsonia praecox]]''.&lt;ref name="EoEarth"/&gt;

=== Fauna ===
[[File:Lightmatter flamingo2.jpg|thumb|Caribbean flamingo (''Phoenicopterus ruber'')]]
The ecoregion is notable for being the habitat of a large community of [[Caribbean flamingo]] (''Phoenicopterus ruber''), besides a diversity of birds and bats.

== Conservation ==
Most of the [[Serranía de Macuira]] lies within [[National Natural Park of Macuira]]. Nearby is the {{convert|80|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} [[Los Flamencos Sanctuary]], which is a center of plant diversity for species of ''[[Hechtia]]'', ''[[Salvia]]'', and [[cactus]]. Of the 2700 species found within, approximately 30% are [[Endemism|endemic]].

'''Imsk''' is a [[fictional planet]] in the 30th century [[DC Universe]]. It is the homeworld of [[Legion of Super-Heroes|Legionnaire]] [[Shrinking Violet (comics)|Shrinking Violet]], as well as villain [[Micro Lad]].

==Imskians==
All Imskians have the ability to shrink, as far as microscopic size. As such Imsk's factories are particularly useful in the construction of micro-circuitry.

Imsk has often been at odds with the [[United Planets]] over its claimed territory in its sector of space.

==v4 Legion==

After the economic collapse of the United Planets, Imsk fought a war with [[Braal (planet)|Braal]], whose native all possess magnetic abilities.  Imsk won the war when they deployed a weapon that turned the Braalian magnetic fields against them, causing them to explode.  [[Cosmic Boy]], who was affected partially by one of these weapons, lost all his magnetic abilities.  Shrinking Violet, who had fought in the war, was imprisoned after she protested the use of this weapon.

==Threeboot==

Following the second reboot of the Legion of Super-Heroes, the Imskians live in a globe on the desk of [[Brainiac 5]], who saved the civilization from an undisclosed threat. It is not clear if they shrink naturally, as in earlier continuities, or if Brainiac's rescue involved the same technology used by his ancestor to shrink [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]].

'''Isbladskärret''' is a small [[lake]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} on [[Djurgården]], an island in central [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. The lake is much appreciated among bird-watchers, and, being part of the [[Royal National City Park]], also carefully monitored by several organizations, including the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]].  The lake is one of six in Djurgården (including Northern Djurgården, north of the island), the others being [[Lillsjön, Djurgården|Lillsjön]], [[Uggleviken]], [[Spegeldammen]], [[Lappkärret]], and [[Laduviken]].&lt;ref name="sthlm-vatten"&gt;{{cite web|title=Isbladskärret |publisher=Stockholms vatten |date=2004-06-28 |location=Stockholm |url=http://www.stockholmvatten.se/vattenvard/sjoar_vattendrag/pdf/04Isblad.pdf |accessdate=2007-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316085812/http://www.stockholmvatten.se/vattenvard/sjoar_vattendrag/pdf/04Isblad.pdf |archivedate=March 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the name ==
[[File:Isbladskärret 02 070607.JPG|thumb|Old pump on the southern approach to the lake.]]
The name is derived from a small hunter's lodge located near the present lake.  In historical records documenting fishing grounds on Djurgården during the 17th century, the lodge is unintelligibly called ''Isbla''.  The same lodge also gave name to a bay, [[Isbladsviken]].  Most Stockholmer's today are likely to interpret the name as ''Is-blads-kärret'' ("The Ice Leaf Marsh").&lt;ref name="Hasselblad"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The area was originally a [[marsh]] separating the northern and southern parts of Djurgården until the 1830s when the canal [[Djurgårdsbrunnskanalen]] was built.  By the turn of the century 1900, [[Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland|Prince Carl]] (1861–1951) settle at [[Parkudden]] nearby and had the swamp drained.  The surrounding area was then used for agriculture until the 1950s, but the pumping-station remained in use until the [[Royal Djurgården Administration]] decided to develop the area in 1981 to attracts birds and plant life and closed to pump.  Within a year [[sea bird]]s had found the lake and more than 70 species have been spotted by the lake since, as a sign in the northern end of the lake knowns to tell.  Footpaths and outlooks have been created around the lake since.&lt;ref name="Hasselblad" /&gt;

== Birds ==
[[File:Isbladskärret 09 070607.JPG|thumb|A family of barnacle geese.]]
[[File:Kaknästornet Rosenhill (Isbladskärret Blockhusudden) Stockholm Sweden 20050812.JPG|thumb|View from [[Kaknästornet]], Isbladskärret is in the center background.]]
The large number of bird species have made the lake and the surrounding area popular among Stockholmers and tourists alike. The lake area is mostly famous for its colony of more than 100 [[heron]]s (all originating from birds that once escaped from the zoo at [[Skansen]]), but the surrounding walks in the forests are also known for the [[tawny owl]] found there.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{cite web

This is a list of television series originally broadcast on, and produced at least partially by, [[Disney Channel]] (formerly "The Disney Channel"), a family-oriented American basic cable channel and former [[premium channel]], owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Both past and present series are included. Future series are only included if they have a confirmed air date. Series that are still in production are marked in '''bold'''.

[[Disney Channel]] has had many popular shows throughout its history.{{Peacock term|reason="Many popular shows" is basically a "peacock/weasel words" claim.|date=March 2017}} Its first ever series was ''[[Good Morning, Mickey!]]'', which ran from 1983 to 1992. The first series branded as a "Disney Channel Original Series" was ''[[Flash Forward]]'', which ran from 1995 to 1999. The channel's first hit series was ''[[The All-New Mickey Mouse Club]]'', which ran from 1989 to 1996.{{citation needed|reason=If you're going to claim a "hit series", you better have the sourcing to back the claim up.|date=March 2017}} Its second hit series was ''[[Even Stevens]]'', which ran from 2000 to 2003.{{citation needed|reason=If you're going to claim a "hit series", you better have the sourcing to back the claim up.|date=March 2017}}

Stations in '''bold''' are [[Interchange station|transfer stations]]; while lines may share many stations, only stations where lines cross, or stations where lines diverge (such as when Lines 17 an 18 go separate ways) are considered transfer stations.

This is a compilation '''lists, by country, of [[canal]]s''' used mainly for navigation. Historically, canals are human-made structures, built for water control, flood prevention, irrigation, and water transport. Their exact design varies depending upon the local importance of each function. This is still the case today, and new canals generally serve multiple functions. Instead of the formal expression 'inland waterways’, the vernacular term 'canal' is often used to describe both human-made canals and river navigations, whether free-flowing waterways, or those with locks and dams or weirs.

This '''list of the indigenous names of the [[Eastern Caribbean]] islands''' is a compilation of the indigenous names that were given by Amerindian people to those islands before the Europeans started naming them. The islands of the Caribbean were settled for over 4,000 years (estimate) before European arrival in 1492. The Eastern Caribbean islands were dominated by two main cultural groups: the [[Arawaks]] and the [[Kalinago]], or Caribs. Individual villages of other distinct cultural groups were also present on the more southerly, larger islands. The large island of Trinidad in particular was shared by both Kalinago and Arawak groups.

Archaeological evidence suggests that the Arawaks arrived first, settling the islands as they travelled North from the [[Orinoco River]] in [[Venezuela]]. The Kalinago people, who proved to be more dominant in warfare, had begun a campaign of conquering and displacement of the Arawaks at the point of European arrival. Also starting at the southern end of the archipelago, they had worked their way north, reaching as far as the island of [[Saint Kitts]] by the 16th century.

The islands north of the Saint Kitts 'borderline' had Arawak names, the islands South had Kalinago names. The island of Barbados was uninhabited at the point of European arrival, but evidence suggests that Barbados followed the same pattern of displacement as witnessed on neighbouring islands, but that it was abandoned for unknown reasons. The only indigenous name on record for Barbados is one documented as the name used by Arawak peoples on Trinidad in reference to that island.

[[Image:Olympia Undae Dunes PIA06848.jpg|right|thumb|Olympia Undae is the largest field of sand dunes on the planet Mars.]]
'''Olympia Undae''' is a vast [[List of extraterrestrial dune fields|dune field]] in the north polar region of the planet [[Mars]]. It consists of a broad "sand sea" or [[erg (landform)|erg]] that partly rings the north polar plateau ([[Planum Boreum]]) from about 120° to 240°E longitude and 78° to 83°N latitude. Stretching about {{convert|1,100|km|mi|abbr=on}} across&lt;ref&gt;JPL Photojournal. http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10948&lt;/ref&gt; and covering an area of 470,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster, N.; Greeley, R. (1990). Sediment Volume in the North Polar Sand Seas of Mars. ''J. Geophys. Res.,'' '''95'''(B7), p. 10,924.&lt;/ref&gt; Olympia Undae is the largest continuous dune field on Mars.  It is similar in size to the [[Rub' Al Khali]] in the Arabian Peninsula, the largest active erg on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Tsoar, H.; Greeley, R.; Peterfreund, A.R. (1979). Mars: The Northern Polar Sand Sea and Related Wind Patterns. ''J. Geophys. Res.,'' '''84'''(B14), p. 8167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Olympia Undae lies within the informally named Borealis basin (also called the north polar basin&lt;ref&gt;Head, J. et al. (1999) Possible Ancient Oceans on Mars: Evidence from Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter Data. ''Science,'' '''286,''' pp. 2134–2137.&lt;/ref&gt;), the largest of three topographic basins that occur in the northern lowlands of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, K.L. ''et al.'' (2008). North Polar Region of Mars: Advances in Stratigraphy, Structure, and Erosional Modification. ''Icarus,'' 196, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; The average elevation in Olympia Undae is about 4,250 m below [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] ([[Geography of Mars#Zero elevation|martian "sea" level]]).&lt;ref&gt;JMARS MOLA elevation dataset.

"New Insights About Mars From the Creation and Analysis of Mars Global Datasets;" American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2007, (abstract #P11E-01).&lt;/ref&gt; The 19-km-diameter crater Jojutla lies near the geographic center of Olympia Undae at 81.63°N latitude and 169.65°E longitude.This crater was named by Andres Eloy Martinez Rojas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/ciencia-y-salud/ciencia/2017/02/17/nombran-asteroide-en-honor-mexicano|title=Nombran asteroide en honor a mexicano|newspaper=El Universal|access-date=2017-02-19|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Mexican astronomer and science writer.&lt;ref&gt;USGS Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature. Mars. http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unda'' (pl. ''undae'') is a Latin term meaning water, particularly water in motion as waves.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, D.P. (1968). ''Cassell's New Latin Dictionary;'' Funk &amp; Wagnalls: New York, p. 623.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) adopted the term to describe "undulatory," dune-like features on other planets.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, J.F.; Snyder, C.W.; Kieffer, H.H. (1992). Appendix: Origin and Use of Martian Nomenclature; In ''Mars,'' H.H. Kieffer ''et al.,'' Eds. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992, p. 1313.&lt;/ref&gt; Olympia Undae contains a variety of dune forms and wind-related ([[aeolian processes|aeolian]]) depositional features, including sand sheets,&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, K.L. ''et al.'' (2008). North polar region of Mars: Advances in stratigraphy, structure, and erosional modification. ''Icarus,'' 196, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; transverse dunes, simple barchan dunes, mega-barchans, and complex barchanoid ridges.&lt;ref&gt;Breed, C.S.; Grolier, M.; McCauley, J.F. (1979). Morphology and Distribution of Common "Sand" Dunes on Mars: Comparison with the Earth. ''J. Geophys. Res.,'' '''84'''(B14), 8187.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these dune types occur on Earth too.

[[Barchan]]s are isolated, crescent-shaped dunes with horns that point downwind. They occur is areas where sand supply is moderate to low.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbleman, J.R.; Williams, S.H. (2007). Eolian Dunes and Deposits in the Western United States as Analogs to Wind-Related Features on Mars, in ''The Geology of Mars: Evidence from Earth-Based Analogs,'' Chapman, M. Ed. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKee, E.D. (1979). Introduction to a Study of Global Sand Seas. USGS Professional Paper 1052, pp. 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Small simple barchan dunes and large mega-barchans are common at the margins of Olympia Undae and in areas where the sand cover is thin.&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, R. ''et al.'' (1992). Martian Aeolian Processes, Sediments, and Features in'' Mars,'' H.H. Kieffer ''et al.,'' Eds. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, AZ, p. 750.&lt;/ref&gt; Barchanoid ridges are broad linear to sinuous sand accumulations.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbleman, J.R.; Williams, S.H. (2007). Eolian Dunes and Deposits in the Western United States as Analogs to Wind-Related Features on Mars, in ''The Geology of Mars: Evidence from Earth-Based Analogs,'' Chapman, M. Ed. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; They form through the lateral coalition of individual barchans and indicate increasing sand supply. Where sand is abundant, transverse dunes occur; they are commonly defined as long barchaoid ridges with fairly straight segments that are perpendicular to the wind direction.&lt;ref&gt;Breed, C.S.; Grolier, M.; McCauley, J.F. (1979). Morphology and Distribution of Common "Sand" Dunes on Mars: Comparison with the Earth. ''J. Geophys. Res.,'' '''84'''(B14), p. 8187.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of dunes in Olympia Undae are transverse dunes. Their spacing ranges from 200 to 800 m apart crest to crest, and comparison to terrestrial dunes with similar spacing indicates that they are 10 to 25 m high.&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, R. ''et al.'' (1992). Martian Aeolian Processes, Sediments, and Features in'' Mars,'' H.H. Kieffer ''et al.,'' Eds. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, AZ, p. 750-751.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Earth, dunes are produced by [[saltation (geology)|saltating]] grains of sand. The requirement that dunes are produced by saltation allows scientists to determine the likely grain size for the particles making up the dunes in Olympia Undae and other martian dune fields. On Mars, the particle size most easily moved by wind is about 100 μm in diameter (fine sand).&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, R. ''et al.'' (1992). Martian Aeolian Processes, Sediments, and Features in'' Mars,'' H.H. Kieffer ''et al.,'' Eds. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, AZ, p. 733.&lt;/ref&gt; The sand in Olympia Undae is extremely dark in color and probably consists of [[basalt]]ic rock fragments. The surface of Olympia Undae has a strong [[thermal emission spectrometer|TES]] Type 2 spectral signature,&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, K.L. et al. (2008). North Polar Region of Mars: Advances in Stratigraphy, Structure, and Erosional Modification. ''Icarus,'' '''196,''' 347.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the surface materials consist of [[basaltic andesite]] or weathered basalt and/or basaltic glass.&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, M., McSween, H., Tanaka, K., Head, J., 2004. Global Geologic Context
for Rock Types and Surface Alteration on Mars. ''Geology,'' '''32,''' pp. 645–648.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the OMEGA instrument on the [[Mars Express]] orbiter detected high concentrations of [[gypsum]] in the eastern portion of Olympia Undae (centered at 244.5°E, 80.2°N).&lt;ref&gt;Langevin, Y. et al. (2005). Sulfates in the North Polar Region of Mars Detected by OMEGA/Mars Express. ''Science,'' '''307'''(1584), {{doi|10.1126/science.1109091}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://crism.jhuapl.edu/gallery/featuredImage/image.php?gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=44| title=Gypsum at Olympia Undae| publisher=CRISM team}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CRISM]] data from the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (MRO) suggests that the gypsum is more concentrated along the crests of dunes than in the interdune hollows.&lt;ref&gt;Roach L.H.; Mustard J.F.; Murchie S.; Langevin Y., Bibring J-P., ''et al.'' (2007). CRISM Spectral Signatures of the North Polar Gypsum Dunes. Lunar Planet. Sci. Conf., 38th, Abstr. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the gypsum is uncertain. Gypsum is an [[evaporite|evaporitic]] mineral that precipitates from saline water; thus, its presence may indicate conditions different from today’s martian environment.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, S. (2009). The Polar Deposits of Mars. Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci., 37, pp. 551–552.&lt;/ref&gt; The mineral may have formed through the melting of acidic snow, or the melting and discharge of sulfur-rich water from the base of the polar ice cap.&lt;ref&gt;Fishbaugh, K.E. et al. (2006). Formation of the Martian North Polar Gypsum Deposit During the Amazonian. Fourth International Conference on Mars Polar Science and Exploration, Abstract #8041. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/polar2006/pdf/8041.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the presence of gypsum does not necessarily require large surface water bodies (e.g., [[playa lake]]s). The mineral could have formed in volcanically heated groundwater in the shallow subsurface and later been exposed and concentrated by wind erosion and [[winnowing]] ("eolian mining").&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, K.L. (2006). Mars’ North Polar Gypsum: Possible Origin Related to Early Amazonian Magmatism at Alba Patera and Aeolian Mining. Fourth International Conference on Mars Polar Science and Exploration, Abstract #8024. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/polar2006/pdf/8024.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Olympia Undae can be the source of some confusion among Mars researchers. The term is used to describe 1) the geographical area described above and the [[type locality (geology)|type area]] for 2) a [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] or geologic map unit (e.g. [[formation (geology)|formation]]) called the Olympia Undae unit. As a stratigraphic unit, Olympia Undae describes materials that make up the geographic Olympia Undae as well as other sand sheets and dune fields encircling Planum Boreum (e.g., [[Abalos Undae]]). The Olympia Undae unit is [[geology of Mars|Amazonian]] in age.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, K.L. ''et al.'' (2008). North Polar Region of Mars: Advances in Stratigraphy, Structure, and Erosional Modification. ''Icarus,'' 196, 318–358.&lt;/ref&gt; To address some of this confusion, the stratigraphic term Olympia Undae unit has recently been renamed to simply "undae unit," since it encompasses other named dune fields (undae) around Planum Boreum.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, K., USGS, personal communication, September 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible source of confusion is the distinction between Olympia Undae and Olympia Planum (formerly, Olympia Planitia). As a geographic area, Olympia Undae refers to the erg that covers a large fraction of Olympia Planum between longitude 120° and 240°E. Olympia Undae and Olympia Planum are not interchangeable terms. Olympia Planum is a broad, plain (and topographic [[bench (geology)|bench]]) adjacent to Planum Boreum. It is half-domed shaped in profile (cross-section) and slopes southward into the [[Vastitas Borealis]]. The Olympia Undae erg covers both the bulk of southern Olympia Planum and part of the northern Vastitas Borealis.

'''Paektu Mountain''' or '''Baekdu Mountain''' is an [[active volcano]] on the [[China–North Korea border]]. At {{convert|2744|m|0|abbr=on}}, it is the highest mountain of the [[Changbai Mountains|Changbai]] and [[Baekdudaegan]] [[mountain range|ranges]]. Koreans assign a mythical quality to the volcano and its caldera lake, considering it to be their country's spiritual home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/world/asia/korea-china-baekdu-changbaishan.html | title = For South Koreans, a Long Detour to Their Holy Mountain | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = September 26, 2016 | author = Choe Sang-Hun }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mountain is called '''Changbai Mountain''' in China. It is the highest mountain on the [[Korean Peninsula]] and in [[Northeast China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quaternary Glaciations: South America, Asia, Africa, Australasia, Antarctica|first=Jürgen|last=Ehlers|first2=Philip|last2=Gibbard|publisher=Elsevier|year=2004|quote=The Changbai Mountain is the highest (2570 m a.s.l.) in north-eastern China (42°N, 128°E) on the border between China and Korea.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large [[crater lake]], called [[Heaven Lake]], is in the [[caldera]] atop the mountain. The caldera was formed by the [[Volcanic explosivity index|VEI]] 7 [[946 eruption of Paektu Mountain|"Millennium" or "Tianchi" eruption of 946]], which erupted about {{convert|100|-|120|km3|cumi|abbr=on}} of [[tephra]]. This was one of the largest and most violent eruptions in the last 5,000 years (alongside the [[Minoan eruption]], the [[Hatepe eruption]] of [[Lake Taupo]] in around AD&amp;nbsp;180, the [[1257 Samalas eruption|1257 eruption]] of Mount Samalas near [[Mount Rinjani]], and the [[1815 eruption of Mount Tambora|1815 eruption]] of [[Mount Tambora|Tambora]]).

==Names==
The modern Korean name of the mountain, '''Mount Paektu''' (or '''Baekdu'''), was first recorded in the 13th historical record [[Goryeosa]]. It means white-head mountain. In other records from the same period, the mountain was also called '''Taebaek Mountain''', which means great-white mountain. The modern name of the mountain in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], Changbai Mountain, comes from modern [[Manchu language|Manchu]] name of the mountain, which is '''Golmin Šanggiyan Alin''' or Long/Ever White Mountain. Similarly, its [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] name is '''Ondor Tsagaan Aula''', the Lofty White Mountain.

==Geography and geology==
[[File:Mount Paektu Relief Map, SRTM-1.jpg|thumb|Relief map]]
Mount Paektu is a [[stratovolcano]] whose cone is truncated by a large [[caldera]], about {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|850|m|ft}} deep, partially filled by the waters of Heaven Lake.&lt;ref name="GVP" /&gt; The lake has a circumference of {{convert|12|to|14|km|mi|abbr=in}}, with an average depth of {{convert|213|m|ft}} and maximum depth of {{convert|384|m|ft}}. From mid-October to mid-June, the lake is typically covered with ice. In 2011, experts in North and [[South Korea]] met to discuss the potential for a significant eruption in the near future,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sam Kim|first=Yonhap|title= S. Korea agrees to talks on possible volcano in N.

The geological forces forming Mount Paektu remain a mystery. Two leading theories are first a [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]] formation and second an uncharted portion of the [[Pacific Plate]] [[Subduction|sinking beneath]] Mount Paektu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetearth.nerc.ac.uk/features/story.aspx?id=1527&amp;cookieConsent=A|title=NERC - Science without borders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central section of the mountain rises about {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}} per year due to rising levels of [[magma]] below the central part of the mountain.  Sixteen peaks exceeding {{convert|2,500|m|abbr=on}} line the caldera rim surrounding Heaven Lake.  The highest peak, called Janggun Peak, is covered in snow about eight months of the year.  The slope is relatively gentle until about {{convert|1800|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}.

Water flows north out of the lake, and near the outlet there is a {{convert|70|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} waterfall.  The mountain is the source of the [[Songhua River|Songhua]], [[Tumen River|Tumen]] and [[Yalu River|Yalu]] rivers. The Tumen and the Yalu form the northern border between North Korea and Russia and China.

===Climate===
[[File:Baitou Mountain Tianchi.jpg|left|thumb|[[Heaven Lake]]]]
The weather on the mountain can be very erratic, sometimes severe. The annual average temperature at the peak is {{convert|-4.9|C}}. During summer, temperatures of about {{convert|18|C}} or higher can be reached, and during winter temperatures can drop to {{convert|-48|C}}. The lowest record temperature was {{convert|-51|C}} on January 2, 1997. The average temperature is about {{convert|-24|C}} in January, and {{convert|10|C}} in July, remaining below freezing for eight months of the year. The average wind speed is {{convert|42|km/h|abbr=on}}, peaking at {{convert|63|km/h|abbr=on}}. The [[relative humidity]] averages 74%.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Millennium eruption===

The mountain's caldera was created in 946 by the colossal ([[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] 7)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=305060 |title=Changbaishan |website=Global Volcanism Program |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[946 eruption of Paektu Mountain|"Millennium"]] or "Tianchi" eruption, one of the most violent eruptions in the last 5,000 years, comparable to the [[Hatepe eruption|180 AD eruption]] of [[Lake Taupo]] and the [[1815 eruption of Mount Tambora|1815 eruption]] of [[Mount Tambora]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Pan|first1 = Bo|last2 = Xu|first2 = Jiandong|year = 2013|title = Climatic impact of the Millennium eruption of Changbaishan volcano in China: New insights from high-precision radiocarbon wiggle-match dating|journal = Geophysical Research Letters|volume = 40|issue = 1|pages = 54–59|doi = 10.1029/2012GL054246|bibcode=2013GeoRL..40...54X|url = http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/download/fedora_content/download/ac:162055/CONTENT/XU_et_al_2013_GRL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eruption, whose [[tephra]] has been found in the southern part of [[Hokkaidō]], Japan, and as far away as Greenland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Timing and climate forcing of volcanic eruptions for the past 2,500 years|last = Sigl|first = M|year = 2015|journal = Nature|doi = 10.1038/nature14565|access-date =|volume=523|issue = 7562|pages=543–49|pmid=26153860|bibcode = 2015Natur.523..543S}}&lt;/ref&gt; destroyed much of the volcano's summit, leaving a caldera that today is filled by [[Heaven Lake]].

According to the Book of Koryo History{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}, "thunders from the heaven drum"{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} (likely the explosions from the Millennium eruption) were heard in the city of [[Kaesong]], and then again in the capital of ancient Korea about {{cvt|450|km}} south of the volcano, which terrified the emperor so much that convicts were pardoned and set free{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. According to the book of Heungboksa Temple History, on November 3 of the same year, in the city of Nara (Japan), about {{cvt|1100|km}} southeast from the mountain, an event of "white ash rain" was recorded. Three months later, on 7 February 947, "drum thunders" were heard in the city of Kyoto (Japan), about {{cvt|1000|km}} southeast of Paektu.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Tianwenfeng eruption has also been recorded in Manchurian myths. Manchus described the mountain as "Fire Dragon", "Fire Demon" or "Heavenly Fire".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chinese Myths and Legends for Tianchi Volcano Eruption|last = Wei|first = Haiquan|year = 2001|journal = Acta Petrologica et Mineralogica|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tianwenfeng eruption===
The age of the Tianwenfeng eruption is not clear, but the carbonized wood in [[Heifengkou]]'s [[Breccia|lag breccia]] has been dated at around {{nowrap|4105 ± 90 [[before present|BP]]}}. This eruption formed large areas covered in yellow [[pumice]] and [[ignimbrite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 长白山天池火山近代喷发|last = 刘|first = 若新|publisher = 科学出版社|year = 1998|isbn = 9787030062857|location = |pages =|language=Chinese }}&lt;/ref&gt; and released about {{convert|23.14|e6t|e6ST|abbr=off}} of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the [[stratosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The mass estimation of volatile emission during 1199–1200 AD eruption of Baitoushan volcano and its significance|last = Zhengfu|first = Guo|year = 2002|journal = Science in China Series D: Earth Sciences|doi = 10.1360/02yd9055|access-date =|volume=45|issue = 6|page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk volume of the [[ejecta]] is at least 100&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, making the Tianwenfeng eruption also of VEI 7.

===Recent events===

After these major eruptions, Mount Paektu had at least three smaller eruptions, which occurred in 1668, 1702, and 1903, likely forming the Baguamiao ignimbrite, the Wuhaojie fine [[pumice]] and the Liuhaojie [[Tuff|tuff ring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Review of eruptive activity at Millennium volcano, Paektusan, northeast China: implications for possible future eruptions|last = Wei|first = Haiquan|year = 2013|journal = Bull Volcanol|doi = 10.1007/s00445-013-0706-5|access-date =|volume=75|issue = 4|bibcode = 2013BVol...75..706W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Government of North Korea invited volcanologists James Hammond of [[Imperial College, London]] and [[Clive Oppenheimer]] of the [[University of Cambridge]], to study the mountain for recent volcanic activity. Their project was continuing in 2014 and  expected to last for another "two or three years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mount-paektu-scientists-granted-access-to-mysterious-north-korean-volcano/|title=Rumbling volcano sees N.

There are five known species of plants in the lake on the peak, and some 168 have been counted along its shores. The forest on the Chinese side is ancient and almost unaltered by humans. [[Birch]] predominates near the [[tree line]], and [[pine]] lower down, mixed with other species. There has been extensive [[deforestation]] on the lower slopes on the North Korean side of the mountain.{{source?|date=August 2018}}

==History==
Mount Paektu has been worshipped by the surrounding peoples throughout history. Both the [[Koreans]] and [[Manchus]] consider it the place of their ancestral origin.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===China===
Mount Paektu was first recorded in the Chinese ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'' under the name Buxian Shan ({{zh|c=不咸山}}). It is also called Shanshan Daling ({{zh|c=單單大嶺}}) in the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]''. In the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'', it was called Taibai Shan ({{zh|c=太白山}}).&lt;ref name=NewTang&gt;Second Canonical Book of the Tang Dynasty. {{lang|zh|《[[:s:zh:新唐書/卷219|新唐書.北狄渤海傳]]》:"契丹盡忠殺營州都督趙翽反，有舍利乞乞仲象者，與靺鞨酋乞四比羽及高麗餘種東走，度遼水，保太白山之東北，阻奧婁河，樹壁自固。"}} (English translation: [[Khitan people|Khitan]] general Jinzhong Li killed Hui Zhao, the commanding officer of [[Yin Zhou]].

The Manchu clan [[Aisin Gioro]], which founded the [[Qing dynasty]] in China, claimed their progenitor Bukūri Yongšon was conceived near Paektu Mountain.

===Korea===

The mountain has been considered sacred by Koreans throughout history. According to Korean mythology, it was the birthplace of [[Dangun]], the founder of the first Korean kingdom, [[Gojoseon]] (2333–108 BC), whose parents were said to be [[Hwanung]], the Son of Heaven, and [[Ungnyeo]], a bear who had been transformed into a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W.

The [[Goryeo]] dynasty (935–1392) first called the mountain ''Paektu'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Goryeosa]] ([[Gwangjong of Goryeo|King Gwangjong]] reign, 959)&lt;/ref&gt; recording that the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]] across the Yalu River were made to live outside of Mount Paektu. The Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910) recorded volcanic eruptions in 1597, 1668, and 1702. In the 15th century, [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|King Sejong the Great]] strengthened the fortification along the Tumen and Yalu rivers, making the mountain a natural border with the northern peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kr.dic.yahoo.com/search/enc/result.html?p=%B9%E9%B5%CE%BB%EA&amp;pk=13856900&amp;subtype=&amp;type=enc&amp;field=id |title=Yahoo Korea Encyclopedia |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Koreans claim that the entire region near Mount Paektu and the Tumen River belongs to Korea and parts of it were illegally given away by Japanese colonialists to China through the [[Gando Convention]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}.

Dense forest around the mountain provided bases for Korean armed resistance against the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]], and later communist guerrillas during the [[Korean War]]. [[Kim Il-sung]] organized his resistance against the Japanese forces there, and North Korea claims that [[Kim Jong-il]] was born there,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korea-dpr.com/ocn/ |title=Moved |publisher=Korea-dpr.com |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although records outside of North Korea suggest that he was actually born in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1671983| publisher=NPR| date=12 February 2004| title=A Visit to Kim Jong Il's Russian Birthplace| last=Sheets| first=Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1907197.stm |title=Profile: Kim Jong-il |publisher=BBC News |date=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Border disputes===

====Historical border disputes====
[[File:Apprx. PRC-DPRK border around Baekdu-Changbai Mountain.PNG|right|500px|thumb|PRC-DPRK border around Paektu Mountain]]
According to ''[[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]]'', the [[Yalu River|Yalu]] (鴨綠江) and [[Tumen River]]s (土門江/圖們江) were set as the borders in the era of the founder of Joseon Dynasty, [[Taejo of Joseon]] (1335–1408).&lt;ref&gt;{{ko icon}}{{zh icon}} [http://sillok.history.go.kr/viewer/viewtype4.jsp?id=waa_10412014_002 朝鮮王朝実録太祖8卷4年（1395年）12月14日] "以鴨綠江爲界。""以豆滿江爲界。"&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the continuous entry of Korean people into Gando, a region in Manchuria that lay north of the Tumen, Manchu and Korean officials surveyed the area and negotiated a border agreement in 1712. To mark the agreement, they built a monument describing the boundary at a watershed, near the south of the crater lake at the mountain peak.  The interpretation of the inscription caused a territorial dispute from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, and is still disputed by academics today. The 1909 [[Gando Convention]] between China and Japan, when [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea was under Japanese rule]], recognized the area north and east as Chinese territory. The border was further clarified in 1962, when China and North Korea negotiated a border treaty on the mountain border in response to minor disputes. The two countries agreed to share the mountain and the lake at the peak, with Korea controlling approximately 54.5% and gaining approximately 230&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;역사비평 (Historical Criticism), Fall 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Some South Korean groups argue that recent activities conducted on the Chinese side of the border, such as economic development, cultural festivals, infrastructure development, promotion of the tourism industry, attempts at registration as a [[World Heritage Site]], and bids for a Winter Olympic Games, are an attempt to claim the mountain as Chinese territory (the People's Republic of China claims the region's territory as their own).&lt;ref name="Chosun"&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200609/200609070022.html  Chosun] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017193302/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200609/200609070022.html |date=17 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Donga"&gt;[http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2006073164698  Donga].&lt;/ref&gt;These groups object to China's use of the name ''Mount Changbai''.&lt;ref name=Jin/&gt; Some groups also regard the entire mountain as Korean territory that was given away by [[North Korea]] in the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name = "Donga" /&gt; Both European maps and Chinese maps dating before the annexation of Mount Paektu and Gando show these areas to be under Korean [[Joseon Dynasty]] control.&lt;ref name = "Focus"&gt;[http://www.koreafocus.or.kr/main_view.asp?volume_id=52&amp;cate_code=C&amp;g_cate_code=CB&amp;g_code=101267 Korea Focus].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hankooki"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060816061846/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200608/kt2006080117133154050.htm Hankooki].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2007 Asian Winter Games]], which were held in [[Changchun]], China, a group of South Korean athletes held up signs during the award ceremony which stated "Mount Paektu is our territory" (Korea claiming Chinese territory as its own). Chinese sports officials delivered a letter of protest on the grounds that political activities violated the spirit of the Olympics and were banned in the charter of the [[International Olympic Committee]] and the [[Olympic Council of Asia]]. The head of the Korea Olympic Committee responded by claiming that the incident was accidental and held no political meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Chosunilbo China Upset with "Baekdu Mountain" Skaters {{cite web |url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200702/200702020024.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329011132/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200702/200702020024.html |archivedate=29 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }} "There are no territorial disputes between China and South Korea.

==Sightseeing==
In addition to domestic tourists, most international visitors, including many South Koreans, climb the mountain from the Chinese side, though it is also a popular tourist destination for visitors to North Korea. The Chinese tourism area is classified as a [[AAAAA scenic area]] by the [[China National Tourism Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.cnta.gov.cn/html/2008-11/2008-11-16-10-27-72978.html|date=16 November 2008|title=AAAAA Scenic Areas|work=[[China National Tourism Administration]]|accessdate=9 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404043021/http://en.cnta.gov.cn/html/2008-11/2008-11-16-10-27-72978.html|archivedate=4 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a number of monuments on the North Korean side of the mountain. Paektu Spa is a natural spring and is used for bottled water. Pegae Hill is a camp site of the [[Korean People's Revolutionary Army]] ({{korean|context=north|hangul=조선인민혁명군|hanja=朝鮮人民革命軍}}) allegedly led by [[Kim Il-sung]] during their struggle against [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]]. Secret camps are also now open to the public. There are several waterfalls, including the Hyongje Falls which splits into two about a third of the way from the top.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In 1992, on the occasion of the 80th [[birthday of Kim Il-sung]], a gigantic sign consisting of metal letters reading "Holy mountain of the revolution" was erected on the side of the mountain. North Koreans claim that there are 216 steps leading to the top of the mountain, symbolizing [[Kim Jong-il]]'s 16 February birth date, but in reality there are more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bärtås |first1=Magnus |last2=Ekman |first2=Fredrik|title=Hirviöidenkin on kuoltava: Ryhmämatka Pohjois-Koreaan |year=2014 |publisher=Tammi|location=Helsinki|language=fi|isbn=978-951-31-7727-0|pages=82–86|trans-title=All Monsters Must Die: An Excursion to North Korea |translator-last=Eskelinen |translator-first=Heikki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paraguay''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ær|ə|ɡ|w|aɪ}}; {{IPA-es|paɾaˈɣwaj}}; {{lang-gn|Paraguái}}, {{IPA-gn|paɾaˈɰwaj|}}), officially the '''Republic of Paraguay''' ({{lang-es|República del Paraguay|links=no}}&lt;!--{{IPA-es|reˈpuβlika ðel paɾaˈɣwai̯|}}--&gt;; {{lang-gn|Tetã Paraguái|links=no}}&lt;!--{{IPA-gn|teˈtã paɾaˈɣwaj|}}--&gt;), is one of only two [[landlocked country|landlocked countries]] in [[South America]] (the other is [[Bolivia]]). It is bordered by [[Argentina]] to the south and southwest, [[Brazil]] to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. Paraguay lies on both banks of the [[Paraguay River]], which runs through the center of the country from north to south. Due to its central location in South America, it is sometimes referred to as ''Corazón de Sudamérica'' ("Heart of South America").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/locales/en-el-corazon-de-sudamerica-1220500.html |title=En el corazón de Sudamérica |publisher=ABC|accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish [[conquistador]]es arrived in 1524 after navigating northwards from the [[Río de la Plata]] to the [[Paraná River]], and finally up the [[Paraguay River]]. In 1537, they established the city of [[Asunción]],&lt;ref&gt;"Paraguay: cómo Asunción se convirtió en "madre" de más de 70 ciudades de Sudamérica hace 480 años". BBC (London, UK). Link: https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-40920828&lt;/ref&gt; which was the first capital of the [[Governorate of the Río de la Plata|Governorate of Paraguay and Río de la Plata]]. Paraguay was the epicenter of the [[Reductions|Jesuit Missions]], where the [[Guaraní people]] were educated and introduced to [[Christianity]] and European culture under the direction of the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Jesuit reduction]]s, mainly during the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Caraman, Philip (1976): "The lost paradise: the Jesuit Republic in South America", New York: Seabury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of the Jesuits]] from Spanish territories in 1767, Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony, with few urban centers and settlers. Following [[Independence of Paraguay|independence from Spain]] at the beginning of the 19th century, Paraguay was ruled by a series of [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] governments who generally implemented [[nationalist]], [[isolationism|isolationist]] and [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies. This period ended with the disastrous [[Paraguayan War]], during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25 - 33% of its territory to the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]]. In the 20th century, Paraguay faced another major international conflict – the [[Chaco War]] – against Bolivia, from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious. Afterwards, the country entered a period of military dictatorships, ending with the 35 year regime of [[Alfredo Stroessner]] that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup. This marked the beginning of the "democratic era" of Paraguay.

With around 7 million inhabitants, Paraguay is a founding member of [[Mercosur]], an original member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[Lima Group]]. Also, the city of [[Luque]], in Asuncion's Metropolitan Area, is the seat of the [[CONMEBOL]]. The Guarani culture is very influential and more than 90% of the people speak different forms of the Guarani language. Paraguayans are known for being a very happy and easy-living people and many times the country topped the "world's happiest place" charts because of the "positive experiences" lived and expressed by the population.&lt;ref&gt;"World's Happiest Country?

==History==
{{Main|History of Paraguay}}

=== Pre-Columbian Era ===
The [[indigenous people|indigenous]] [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] had been living in eastern Paraguay for at least a millennium before the arrival of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]. Western Paraguay, the [[Gran Chaco]], was inhabited by nomads of whom the [[Guaycuru]] peoples were the most prominent. The Paraguay River was roughly the dividing line between the agricultural Guarani people to the east and the nomadic and semi-nomadic people to the west in the Gran Chaco. The Guarcuru nomads were known for their warrior traditions and were not fully pacified until the late 19th century. These indigenous tribes belonged to five distinct language families, which were the bases of their major divisions. Differing language speaking groups were generally competitive over resources and territories. They were further divided into tribes by speaking languages in branches of these families. Today 17 separate [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups remain.

=== Colonization ===
The first Europeans in the area were Spanish explorers in 1516.&lt;ref name=eec&gt;Sacks, Richard S. "Early explorers and conquistadors". In Hanratty &amp; Meditz.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish explorer [[Juan de Salazar de Espinosa]] founded the settlement of [[Asunción]] on 15 August 1537. The city eventually became the center of a [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial province of Paraguay]].

An attempt to create an autonomous Christian Indian nation &lt;ref name="cite wdl|#2581"&gt;{{cite web |url={{wdl|2581}} |title=Paraguariae Provinciae Soc. Jesu cum Adiacentibg. Novissima Descriptio |language=Latin |trans-title=A Current Description of the Province of the Society of Jesus in Paraguay with Neighboring Areas |work=World Digital Library |date=1732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was undertaken by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missions and settlements in this part of South America in the eighteenth century, which included portions of Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil. They developed [[Jesuit reduction]]s to bring Guarani populations together at Spanish missions and protect them from virtual slavery by Spanish settlers and Portuguese slave raiders, the [[Bandeirantes]]. In addition to seeking their conversion to Christianity. Catholicism in Paraguay was influenced by the indigenous peoples; the [[syncretic]] religion has absorbed native elements. The ''reducciones'' flourished in eastern Paraguay for about 150 years, until the expulsion of the Jesuits by the Spanish Crown in 1767. The ruins of two 18th-century [[Jesuit Missions of La Santísima Trinidad de Paraná and Jesús de Tavarangue]] have been designated as [[World Heritage Sites]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name="cite wdl|#2581"/&gt;

In western Paraguay Spanish settlement and Christianity were strongly resisted by the nomadic Guaycuru and other nomads from the 16th century onward. Most of these peoples were absorbed into the [[mestizo]] population in the 18th and 19th centuries.

=== Independence and rule of Francia===
{{main|Independence of Paraguay}}
[[File:José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia.jpg|left|thumb|[[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]], Paraguay's first dictator.]]
Paraguay overthrew the local Spanish administration on 14 May 1811. Paraguay's first dictator was [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]] who ruled Paraguay from 1814 until his death in 1840, with very little outside contact or influence. He intended to create a [[utopian]] society based on the French theorist [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s [[The Social Contract|''Social Contract'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://warofthepacific.com/warofthetriplealliance.htm War of The Triple Alliance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807073919/http://warofthepacific.com/warofthetriplealliance.htm# |date=7 August 2014 }}, War of the Pacific. Retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodríguez de Francia established new laws that greatly reduced the powers of the Catholic church (Catholicism was then an established state religion) and the cabinet, forbade colonial citizens from marrying one another and allowed them to marry only blacks, [[mulattoes]] or natives, in order to break the power of colonial-era elites and to create a [[mixed-race]] or mestizo society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romero|first1=Simon|title=In Paraguay, Indigenous Language With Unique Staying Power|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/world/americas/in-paraguay-indigenous-language-with-unique-staying-power.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cut off relations between Paraguay and the rest of South America. Because of Francia's restrictions of freedom, [[Fulgencio Yegros]] and several other Independence-era leaders in 1820 planned a ''coup d’état'' against Francia, who discovered the plot and had its leaders either executed or imprisoned for life.

===Rule of the López family===
After Francia's death in 1840, Paraguay was ruled by various military officers under a new ''[[military junta|junta]]'', until [[Carlos Antonio López]] (allegedly Rodríguez de Francia's nephew) came to power in 1841. López modernized Paraguay and opened it to foreign commerce. He signed a [[non-aggression pact]] with Argentina and officially declared independence of Paraguay in 1842. After López's death in 1862, power was transferred to his eldest son, [[Francisco Solano López]].

The regime of the López family was characterized by pervasive and rigid centralism in production and distribution. There was no distinction between the public and the private spheres, and the López family ruled the country as it would a large estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+py0019) "Carlos Antonio López"], Library of Congress Country Studies, December 1988. URL accessed 30 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government exerted control on all exports. The export of [[yerba mate]] and valuable wood products maintained the balance of trade between Paraguay and the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{worldhistory|section=1665|quote=Page 630}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paraguayan government was extremely protectionist, never accepted loans from abroad and levied high [[tariff]]s against imported foreign products. This [[protectionism]] made the society self-sufficient, and it also avoided the debt suffered by Argentina and Brazil. Slavery existed in Paraguay, although not in great numbers, until 1844, when it was legally abolished in the new Constitution.{{sfn|Cunninghame Graham|1933|p=39-40}}

[[Francisco Solano López]], the son of Carlos Antonio López, replaced his father as the President-Dictator in 1862, and generally continued the political policies of his father. Both wanted to give an international image of Paraguay as "democratic and republican", but in fact, the ruling family had almost total control of all public life in the country, including Church and colleges.{{sfn|Cunninghame Graham|1933|p=41-42}}

Militarily, Carlos Antonio López modernized and expanded industry and the [[Paraguayan Army]] and greatly strengthened the strategic defences of Paraguay by developing the [[Fortress of Humaitá]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cowley, ''The Reader's Encyclopedia to Military History''. New York, New York: Houston Mifflin, 1996. Page 479.&lt;/ref&gt;  The government hired more than 200 foreign technicians, who installed [[telegraph]] lines and [[railroad]]s to aid the expanding steel, textile, paper and ink, naval construction, weapons and gunpowder industries.  The [[Ybycuí]] foundry, completed in 1850, manufactured cannons, mortars and bullets of all calibers. River warships were built in the shipyards of Asunción. Fortifications were built, especially along the [[Apa River]] and in [[Gran Chaco]].&lt;ref name=Hooker&gt;Hooker, T.D., 2008, The Paraguayan War, Nottingham: Foundry Books, {{ISBN|1901543153}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}}  The work was continued by his son Francisco Solano and in terms of socio-economic development, the country was dubbed as "the most advanced Republic in South America", notably by the British judge and politician [[Robert Phillimore|Sir Robert Phillimore]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Phillimore (1860), ''A Statement of the Facts of the Controversy Between the Governments of Great Britain and Paraguay'', page 2.

According to George Thompson, C.E., Lieutenant Colonel of Engineers in the Paraguayan Army prior to and during the war, López's government was comparatively a good one for Paraguay:
{{quote|Probably in no other country in the world has life and property been so secure as all over Paraguay during his (Antonio Lopez's) reign. Crime was almost unknown, and when committed, immediately detected and punished. The mass of the people was, perhaps, the happiest in existence. They had hardly to do any work to gain a livelihood. Each family had its house or hut in its own ground. They planted, in a few days, enough tobacco, maize and mandioca for their own consumption [...]. Having at every hut a grove of oranges [...] and also a few cows, they were almost throughout the year under little necessity [...]. The higher classes, of course, lived more in the European way...|George Thompson, C.E.{{sfn|Thompson|1869|p=10}} }}

===Paraguayan War (1864–1870)===
{{main|Paraguayan War|Paraguayan War casualties}}
[[File:FRANCISCO SOLANO LOPEZ (From a Photograph taken in 1859).jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Solano López]]]]
On 12 October 1864, despite Paraguayan ultimatums, the [[Empire of Brazil|Brazilian Empire]] (sided with the Argentine Government under Gen. [[Bartolomé Mitre]] and the rebellious [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Uruguayan colorados]] led by Gen. [[Venancio Flores]]) invaded the Republic of Uruguay in order to overthrow the Government of that time (which was under the rule of the [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blanco Party]], an ally of López)&lt;ref&gt;The Blanco Party of Uruguay, hardline right wing and reactionary at those days, was in the Uruguayan Government during the outbreak of the war and were allies of the Paraguayan Government. See the classic book of the Blanco Leader Luis Alberto de Herrera (1927): "El Drama del 65 - La Culpa Mitrista", pp. 11 - 33. Bareiro y Ramos Editors. Montevideo, Uruguay&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, thus starting the [[Paraguayan War]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir Richard Francis Burton: "Letters from the Battlefields of Paraguay", p.76 – Tinsley Brothers Editors – London (1870) – Burton, as a witness of the conflict, marks this date (12–16 October 1864) as the real beginning of the war. He writes (and it's the most logic account, considering the facts): ''The Brazilian Army invades the Banda Oriental, despite the protestations of President López, who declared that such invasion would be held a "casus belli"''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paraguayans, led by the [[Grand marshal|Marshal of the Republic]] Francisco Solano López, retalliated by [[Mato Grosso Campaign|attacking the Matto Grosso]] on 15 December 1864 and later declared war against Argentina on 23 March 1865. The "Blanco Government" was toppled and replaced by a "Colorado Government" under Gen. Venancio Flores on 22 February 1865 and afterwards, the [[Argentine Republic]], the [[Empire of Brazil]] and the [[Republic of Uruguay]] signed the infamous [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Secret Treaty of the Triple Alliance]] against the Paraguayan Government, on 1 May 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Pomer, León (2008): "La Guerra del Paraguay: Estado, Política y Negocios" (in Spanish), pp. 240 - 241. Buenos Aires: Editorial Colihue.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paraguayans held a ferocious resistance but were ultimately defeated in 1870 after the [[Battle of Cerro Corá]], where Marshal Solano López was killed in action, refusing to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Hooker, T.D., 2008, "The Paraguayan War". Nottingham: Foundry Books, pp. 105–108. {{ISBN|1901543153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real causes of this war, which remains the bloodiest international conflict in the history of [[The Americas]], are still highly debated.&lt;ref&gt;The classical view asserts that Francisco Solano López's expansionist and hegemonic views are the main reason for the outbreak of the conflict. The traditional Paraguayan view, held by the "''lopistas''" (supporters of Solano López, both in Paraguay and worldwide), affirms that Paraguay acted in self-defense and for the protection of the "Equilibrium of the Plate Basin". This view is usually contested by the "''anti-lopistas''" (also known in Paraguay as "''legionarios''"), who favoured the "''Triple Alliance''". Revisionist views, both from right and left wing national-populists, put a great emphasis on the influence of the British Empire in the conflict, a view that is discarded by a majority of historians.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paraguay lost around 25 - 33% of its territory to Argentina and Brazil, was forced to pay an enormous war debt and to sell large amounts of national properties in order to restore its internal budget. But the worst consequence of the war was the catastrophic loss of population. At least 50% of the Paraguayans died during the conflict and took long decades for the country to recover. About the disaster suffered by the Paraguayans at the outcome of the war, [[William D. Rubinstein]] wrote:

''"The normal estimate is that of a Paraguayan population of somewhere between 450,000 and 900,000, only 220,000 survived the war, of whom only 28,000 were adult males."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Rubinsein | first = W.

During the pillaging of Asunción in 1869, the [[Imperial Brazilian Army]] packed up and transported the Paraguayan National Archives to [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;Hipólito Sanchez Quell: "Los 50.000 Documentos Paraguayos Llevados al Brasil". Ediciones Comuneros, Asunción (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some of the documents taken by Brasil during the war, were returned to Paraguay in the collection known as "Colección de Río Branco", nowadays in the National Archives of Asunción, Paraguay&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil's records from the war have remained classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barbara Weinstein |url=http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2007/0704/0704pre1.cfm |title=Let the Sunshine In: Government Records and National Insecurities |publisher=Historians.org |date=28 January 2008 |accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has made Paraguayan history in the Colonial and early National periods difficult to research and study.

[[File:Recrutas paraguaios..jpg|thumbnail|right|Paraguayan recruits during the Chaco war]]
In 1904 the Liberal revolution against the rule of Colorados broke out. The Liberal rule started a period of great political instability. Between 1904 and 1954 Paraguay had thirty-one [[President of Paraguay|presidents]], most of whom were removed from office by force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hanratty| first = Dannin M.| last2 = Meditz| first2 = Sandra W.| title = Paraguay: A Country Study| place = Washington| publisher = GPO for the Library of Congress| year = 1988| url = http://countrystudies.us/paraguay/2.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts between the factions of the ruling Liberal party led to the [[Paraguayan Civil War (1922)|Paraguayan Civil War of 1922]].

The unresolved border conflict with Bolivia over the Chaco region finally erupted in the early 1930s in the [[Chaco War]]. After great losses Paraguay defeated Bolivia and established its sovereignty over most of the disputed Chaco region. After the war, military officers used popular dissatisfaction with the Liberal politicians to seize the power for themselves. On 17 February 1936, the [[February Revolution (Paraguay)|February Revolution]] brought colonel [[Rafael Franco]] to power. Between 1940 and 1948, the country was ruled by general [[Higinio Morínigo]]. Dissatisfaction with his rule resulted in the [[Paraguayan Civil War (1947)|Paraguayan civil war of 1947]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/nation/pat/paraguay/fparaguay1947.htm |title=Paraguay Civil War 1947 |publisher=Onwar.com |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its aftermath [[Alfredo Stroessner]] began involvement in a string of plots, which resulted in his military [[coup d'état]] of 4 May 1954.

===Stroessner era, 1954–1989===
{{See also|El Stronato}}
A series of unstable governments ensued until the establishment in 1954 of the regime of dictator [[Alfredo Stroessner]], who remained in office for more than three decades until 1989. Paraguay was modernized to some extent under Stroessner's regime, although his rule was marked by extensive human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/16/AR2006081601729.html |title=Alfredo Stroessner; Paraguayan Dictator |work=The Washington Post |date= 17 August 2006|accessdate=2 May 2010 | first=Adam | last=Bernstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroessner and the ''Colorado'' party ruled the country from 1954 to 1989. The dictator oversaw an era of economic expansion, but also had a poor human rights and environmental record (see "Political History"). Paraguay actively participated in [[Operation Condor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dinges |first1=John |title=Operation Condor |url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/chile/operation-condor.htm |website=latinamericanstudies.org |publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torture and death for political opponents was routine. After his overthrow, the ''Colorado'' continued to dominate national politics until 2008.

The splits in the ''Colorado'' Party in the 1980s, and the prevailing conditions: Stroessner's advanced age, the character of the regime, the economic downturn, and [[international isolation]], were catalysts for anti-regime demonstrations and statements by the opposition prior to the 1988 general elections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

''[[Authentic Radical Liberal Party|PLRA]]'' leader [[Domingo Laíno]] served as the focal point of the opposition in the second half of the 1980s. The government's effort to isolate Laino by exiling him in 1982 had backfired. On his sixth attempt to re-enter the country in 1986, Laino returned with three television crews from the U.S., a former United States ambassador to Paraguay, and a group of Uruguayan and Argentine congressmen. Despite the international contingent, the police violently barred Laino's return.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The Stroessner regime relented in April 1987, and permitted Laino to return to Asunción. Laino took the lead in organizing demonstrations and reducing infighting among the opposition party. The opposition was unable to reach agreement on a common strategy regarding the elections, with some parties advocating abstention, and others calling for blank voting. The parties held numerous 'lightning demonstrations' (''mítines relámpagos''), especially in rural areas. Such demonstrations were gathered and quickly disbanded before the arrival of the police.

In response to the upsurge in opposition activities, Stroessner condemned the Accord for advocating "sabotage of the general elections and disrespect of the law".  He used national police and civilian [[vigilantes]] of the ''Colorado'' Party to break up demonstrations. A number of opposition leaders were imprisoned or otherwise harassed. [[Hermes Rafael Saguier]], another key leader of the ''PLRA'', was imprisoned for four months in 1987 on charges of sedition. In early February 1988, police arrested 200 people attending a National Coordinating Committee meeting in [[Coronel Oviedo]]. Laino and several other opposition figures were arrested before dawn on the day of the election, 14 February, and held for twelve hours. The government declared Stroessner's re-election with 89% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/15/world/paraguayan-wins-his-eighth-term.html?scp=3&amp;sq=Paraguay%20february%201988&amp;st=cse "Paraguayan Wins His Eighth Term"], ''The New York Times'', 15 February 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposition attributed the results in part to the virtual Colorado monopoly on the mass media. They noted that 53% of those polled indicated that there was an "uneasiness" in Paraguayan society. 74% believed that the political situation needed changes, including 45% who wanted a substantial or total change. Finally, 31% stated that they planned to abstain from voting in the February elections. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===Stroessner's overthrow, post-1989===
On 3 February 1989, Stroessner was overthrown in a military coup headed by General [[Andrés Rodríguez (President)|Andrés Rodríguez]]. As president, Rodríguez instituted political, legal, and economic reforms and initiated a ''rapprochement'' with the international community. Reflecting the deep hunger of the rural poor for land, hundreds immediately occupied thousands of acres of unused territories belonging to Stroessner and his associates; by mid-1990, 19,000 families occupied {{convert|340000|acres|-3|abbr=on}}. At the time, 2.06 million people lived in rural areas, more than half of the 4.1 million total population, and most were landless.&lt;ref name="nagel"/&gt;

The June 1992 constitution established a democratic system of government and dramatically improved protection of fundamental human rights. In May 1993, Colorado Party candidate [[Juan Carlos Wasmosy]] was elected as Paraguay's first civilian president in almost 40 years, in what international observers deemed fair and free elections.

With support from the United States, the Organization of American States, and other countries in the region, the Paraguayan people rejected an April 1996 attempt by then Army Chief General [[Lino Oviedo]] to oust President Wasmosy.

Oviedo was nominated as the Colorado candidate for president in the 1998 election, however, when the Supreme Court upheld in April his conviction on charges related to the 1996 coup attempt, he was not allowed to run and was detained in jail. His former running mate, [[Raúl Cubas]], became the Colorado Party's candidate, and was elected in May in elections deemed by international observers to be free and fair. One of Cubas' first acts after taking office in August was to commute Oviedo's sentence and release him. In December 1998, Paraguay's Supreme Court declared these actions unconstitutional. In this tense atmosphere, the murder of Vice President and long-time Oviedo rival [[Luis María Argaña]] on 23 March 1999, led the Chamber of Deputies to impeach Cubas the next day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} On 26 March, eight student anti-government demonstrators were murdered, widely believed to have been carried out by Oviedo supporters. This increased opposition to Cubas, who resigned on 28 March. Senate President [[Luis González Macchi]], a Cubas opponent, was peacefully sworn in as president the same day.

In 2003, Nicanor Duarte Frutos was elected as president.

===Election of Fernando Lugo===
For the 2008 general elections, the Colorado Party was favored in polls. Their candidate was Minister of Education [[Blanca Ovelar]], the first woman to be nominated as a candidate for a major party in Paraguayan history. After sixty years of Colorado rule, voters chose [[Fernando Lugo]], a former Roman Catholic Bishop and not a professional politician in civil government, and a member of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, Paraguay's largest opposition party. Lugo was an adherent of [[liberation theology]]. Lugo achieved a historic victory in Paraguay's presidential election, defeating the ruling party candidate, and ending 61 years of conservative rule. Lugo won with nearly 41% of the vote, compared to almost 31% for Blanca Ovelar of the Colorado party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.electstud.2008.10.001 | author = Nickson, Andrew | year = 2009 | title = The general election in Paraguay, April 2008 | journal = Journal of Electoral Studies | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 145–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outgoing President Nicanor Duarte Frutos hailed the moment as the first time in the history of the nation that a government had transferred power to opposition forces in a constitutional and peaceful fashion.

Lugo was sworn in on 15 August 2008. The Lugo administration set its two major priorities as the reduction of corruption and economic inequality.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1841.htm#econ |title=Paraguay |publisher=State.gov |date=15 March 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saludo de Piñera a Cartes.jpg|thumb|Inauguration of new President [[Horacio Cartes]], 15 August 2013]] 
Political instability following Lugo's election and disputes within his cabinet encouraged some renewal of popular support for the Colorado Party. Reports suggested that the businessman Horacio Cartes became the new political figure amid disputes. Despite the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]'s strong accusations against Cartes related to drug trafficking, he continued to amass followers in the political arena.

On 14 January 2011, the Colorado Party convention nominated Horacio Cartes as the presidential candidate for the party. However, the party's constitution didn't allow it.{{clarify|date=April 2012}}
On 21 June 2012, [[Impeachment of Fernando Lugo|impeachment proceedings against President Lugo]] began in the country's lower house, which was controlled by his opponents.

== Geography and climate ==

=== Geography ===
{{Main|Geography of Paraguay}}
[[File:Paraguay map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Paraguay map of Köppen climate classification]]
[[File:Chaco Boreal Paraguay.jpg|thumb|Landscape in the [[Gran Chaco]], Paraguay]]
Paraguay is divided by the [[Río Paraguay]] into two well differentiated geographic regions. The eastern region (Región Oriental); and the western region, officially called Western Paraguay (Región Occidental) and also known as the Chaco, which is part of the [[Gran Chaco]]. The country lies between latitudes [[19th parallel south|19°]] and [[28th parallel south|28°S]], and longitudes [[54th meridian west|54°]] and [[63rd meridian west|63°W]].
The terrain consists mostly of grassy plains and wooded hills in the eastern region. To the west are mostly low, marshy plains.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Paraguay}}
The overall climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subtropical climate|subtropical]]. Like most lands in the region, Paraguay has only wet and dry periods. Winds play a major role in influencing Paraguay's weather: between October and March, warm winds blow from the Amazon Basin in the North, while the period between May and August brings cold winds from the Andes.

The absence of mountain ranges to provide a natural barrier allows winds to develop speeds as high as {{convert|161|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. This also leads to significant changes in temperature within a short span of time; between April and September, temperatures will sometimes drop below freezing. January is the hottest summer month, with an average daily temperature of 28.9 degrees Celsius (84 degrees F).

Rainfall varies dramatically across the country, with substantial rainfall in the eastern portions, and semi-arid conditions in the far west. The far eastern forest belt receives an average of {{convert|170|cm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} of rain annually, while the western Chaco region typically averages no more than {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} a year. The rains in the west tend to be irregular and evaporate quickly, contributing to the aridity of the area.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Paraguay |Human rights in Paraguay|Foreign relations of Paraguay}}
Paraguay is a [[representative democratic]] republic, with a multi-party system and [[separation of powers]] in three branches. Executive power is exercised solely by the [[President of Paraguay|President]], who is [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the two chambers of the [[Congress of Paraguay|National Congress]]. The [[Judicial Branch|judiciary]] is vested on [[tribunals]] and Courts of [[Civil Law (legal system)|Civil Law]] and a nine-member Supreme Court of Justice, all of them independent of the executive and the legislature.

===Military===
{{main|Military of Paraguay}}
[[File:Paraguayan marines at Ancon Marine Base 2010-07-19.JPG|thumb|Paraguayan marines at Ancon Marine Base]]
The [[military of Paraguay]] consist of the Paraguayan [[army]], [[navy]] (including [[naval aviation]] and [[marine corps]]) and [[air force]].

The [[constitution of Paraguay]] (article 238) establishes the [[president of Paraguay]] as the [[commander-in-chief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of 1992|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Paraguay/|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paraguay has [[Conscription|compulsory military service]], and all 18-year-old males and 17-year-olds in the year of their 18th birthday are liable for one year of [[active duty]]. Although the 1992 constitution allows for conscientious objection, no enabling legislation has yet been approved.

In July 2005, military aid in the form of U.S. [[Special Forces]] began arriving at Paraguay's [[Mariscal Estigarribia]] air base, a sprawling complex built in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=U.S. Military Moves in Paraguay Rattle Regional Relations | publisher=[[International Relations Center]] | date=14 December 2005 | url=http://americas.irc-online.org/am/2991 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Ppo0hSpY?url=http://americas.irc-online.org/am/2991 | archivedate=24 June 2007 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarin"&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/2005/09/11/z-03615.htm US Marines put a foot in Paraguay], ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|El Clarín]]'', 9 September 2005 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative subdivisions===
{{Main|Departments of Paraguay|Districts of Paraguay}}
Paraguay consists of seventeen departments and one capital district (''distrito capital'').

It is also divided into 2 regions: The "Occidental Region" or Chaco (Boquerón, Alto Paraguay and Presidente Hayes), and the "Oriental Region" (the other departments and the capital district).

These are the departments, with their capitals, population, area and the number of districts:

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Paraguay}}
The macroeconomy in Paraguay is characterized by a historical low inflation rate – 5% average (in 2013, the inflation rate was 3.7%), international reserves 20% of GDP and twice the amount of the external national debt. The country enjoys clean and renewable energy production of 8,700 MW (current{{when|date=June 2018}} domestic demand 2,300 MW).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140201204724/http://www.opportunitiesinparaguay.com/Focus.html Focus]. opportunitiesinparaguay.com&lt;/ref&gt; Paraguay is the world's largest exporter of electric power, from two large [[hydroelectric power]] projects along its borders. The excess production is sold to Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Between 1970 and 2013, the country had the highest economic growth of South America,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} with an average rate of 7.2% per year.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In 2010 and 2013, Paraguay experienced the greatest economic expansion of South America, with a GDP growth rate of 14.5% and 13.6% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bcp.gov.py BCP – Banco Central del Paraguay]. Bcp.gov.py. Retrieved on 18 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paraguay Export Treemap.png|thumb|left|Graphical depiction of Paraguay's product exports in 28 color-coded categories, 2012]]
Paraguay is the sixth-largest [[soybean]] producer in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pa.html|title=Paraguay|last=|first=|date=12 January 2017|website=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|access-date=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; second-largest producer of [[stevia]], second-largest producer of [[tung oil]], sixth-largest exporter of corn, tenth-largest exporter of wheat and 8th largest exporter of beef.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The market economy is distinguished by a large informal sector, featuring re-export of imported consumer goods to neighboring countries, as well as the activities of thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors. Nonetheless, over the last 10 years the Paraguayan economy diversified dramatically, with the energy, auto parts and clothing industries leading the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paraguay un milagro americano|url=http://paraguay-un-milagro-americano.blogspot.com|accessdate=15 January 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country also boasts the third most important free commercial zone in the world: [[Ciudad del Este]], trailing behind [[Miami]] and [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exportimportstatistics.com/country-profile/Paraguay-profile.aspx|title=Paraguay|website=www.exportimportstatistics.com|access-date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large percentage of the population, especially in rural areas, derives its living from agricultural activity, often on a subsistence basis. Because of the importance of the informal sector, accurate economic measures are difficult to obtain. The economy grew rapidly between 2003 and 2013 as growing world demand for commodities combined with high prices and favorable weather to support Paraguay's commodity-based export expansion.

In 2012, Paraguay's government introduced the MERCOSUR(FOCEM) system in order to stimulate the economy and job growth through a partnership with both Brazil and Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120414050706/http://www.economia.gov.py/v2/index.php?tag=que-es-focem Subsecretaria De Estado De Economia – ¿Qué Es Focem?].

===Industry and manufacturing===
[[File:BBVA Paraguay.jpg|thumb|[[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria|BBVA]] Paraguay]]
The [[mineral industry of Paraguay]] produces about 25% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and employs about 31% of the labor force. Production of [[cement]], [[iron ore]], and [[steel]] occurs commonly throughout Paraguay's industrial sector. The growth of the industry was further fueled by the [[maquila]] industry, with large industrial complexes located in the eastern part of the country. Paraguay put in place many incentives aimed to attract industries to the country. One of them is the so-called "Maquila law" by which companies can relocate to Paraguay, enjoying minimal tax rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mic.gov.py/v1/node/123 ÂżQuĂŠ es Maquila? | Ministerio de Industria y Comercio – Paraguay]. Mic.gov.py. Retrieved on 18 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[pharmaceutical industry]], Paraguayan companies now{{when|date=February 2016}} meet 70% of domestic consumption and have begun to [[export]] drugs. Paraguay is quickly{{quantify|date=February 2016}} supplanting foreign suppliers in meeting the country's drug needs.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Strong growth also is evident in the production of edible oils, garments, organic sugar, meat processing, and steel.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In 2003 manufacturing made up 13.6% of the GDP, and the sector employed about 11% of the working population in 2000. Paraguay's primary manufacturing focus is on food and beverages. Wood products, paper products, hides and furs, and non-metallic mineral products also contribute to manufacturing totals. Steady growth in the manufacturing GDP during the 1990s (1.2% annually) laid the foundation for 2002 and 2003, when the annual growth rate rose to 2.5%.&lt;ref&gt;

===Social issues===
{{Update|section|date=April 2014}}
Various poverty estimates suggest that 30–50% of the population is poor.&lt;ref&gt;2003 Census Bureau Household Survey&lt;/ref&gt; In rural areas, 41.20% of the people lack a monthly income to cover basic necessities, whereas in urban centers this figure is 27.6%. The top 10% of the population holds 43.8% of the national income, while the lowest 10% has 0.5%. The economic recession has worsened income inequality, notably in the rural areas, where the [[Gini coefficient]] has risen from 0.56 in 1995 to 0.66 in 1999.

More recent data (2009)&lt;ref name="abc.com.py"&gt;{{cite web|author=${w.time} |url=http://www.abc.com.py/nota/en-paraguay-disminuyo-la-pobreza-entre-2003-y-2009/ |title=En Paraguay, disminuyó la pobreza entre 2003 y 2009 – ABC Color |publisher=Abc.com.py |accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that 35% of the Paraguayan population is poor, 19% of which live in extreme poverty. Moreover, 71% of the latter live in rural areas of the country.

Similarly, land concentration in the Paraguayan countryside is one of the highest in the globe: 10% of the population controls 66% of the land, while 30% of the rural people are landless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marió|year=2004|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSOCIALDEV/Resources/3177394-1168615404141/ParaguayCountrySocialAnalysis.pdf |title=''Paraguay: Social Development Issues for Poverty Alleviation''|publisher=World Bank report|accessdate=18 June 2007|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the immediate aftermath of the 1989 overthrow of Stroessner, some 19,000 rural families occupied hundreds of thousands of acres of unused lands formerly held by the dictator and his associates by mid-1990, but many rural poor remained landless. This inequality has caused a great deal of tensions between the landless and land owners.&lt;ref name="nagel"&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1921 Nagel, Beverly Y.(1999) "'Unleashing the Fury': The Cultural Discourse of Rural Violence and Land Rights in Paraguay"], in ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'', 1999, Vol. 41, Issue 1: 148–181.

Paraguay's population is distributed unevenly through the country, with the vast majority of people living in the eastern region near the capital and largest city, [[Asunción]], which accounts for 10% of the country's population. The [[Gran Chaco]] region, which includes the [[Alto Paraguay Department|Alto Paraguay]], [[Boquerón Department|Boquerón]] and [[Presidente Hayes Department]], and accounts for about 60% of the territory, is home to less than 2% of the population. About 56% of Paraguayans live in urban areas, making Paraguay one of the least urbanized nations in South America.

For most of its history, Paraguay has been a recipient of immigrants, owing to its low population density, especially after the demographic collapse that resulted from the Paraguayan War. Small groups of ethnic Italians, Germans, Russians, [[Japanese Paraguayan|Japanese]], [[Koreans in Paraguay|Koreans]], Chinese, [[Lebanese migration to Paraguay|Arabs]], [[Ukrainians in Paraguay|Ukrainians]], [[Poles]], [[Jews]], Brazilians, and Argentines have also settled in Paraguay. Paraguay has also been a haven for communities persecuted for the religious faith, like the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]] who were forced to leave England in 1941 because of their pacifist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/a-life-of-the-land-cut-short/|title=A Life of the Land, Cut Short|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Bruderhof_Communities|title=Bruderhof Communities - GAMEO|website=gameo.org|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these communities have retained their languages and culture, particularly the [[Brazilian people|Brazilians]], who represent the largest and most prominent immigrant group, at around 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/countries/paraguay-facts/ Paraguay Information and History].

There is no official data on the ethnic composition of the Paraguayan population, as the Department of Statistics, Surveys and Censuses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgeec.gov.py/ |title=Dirección General de Estadísticas, Encuestas y Censos |publisher=Dgeec.gov.py |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Paraguay does not ask about ''race'' and ''ethnicity'' in census surveys, although it does inquire about the indigenous population. According to the census of 2002, the indigenous people made up 1.7% of Paraguay's total population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120118042911/http://www.rlc.fao.org/es/desarrollo/mujer/docs/paraguay/par03.pdf CAPÍTULO III.

Traditionally, the majority of the Paraguayan population is considered mixed (''mestizo'' in Spanish). HLA-DRB1 polymorphism studies have shown the genetic distances between Paraguayans and Spanish populations were closer than between Paraguayans and Guaranis. Altogether these results suggest the predominance of the Spanish genetic in the Paraguayan population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11873625|year=2002|author1=Benitez|first1=O|title=Hispano-Indian admixture in Paraguay studied by analysis of HLA-DRB1 polymorphism|journal=Pathologie-biologie|volume=50|issue=1|pages=25–9|last2=Loiseau|first2=P|last3=Busson|first3=M|last4=Dehay|first4=C|last5=Hors|first5=J|last6=Calvo|first6=F|last7=Durand Mura|first7=M|last8=Charron|first8=D|doi=10.1016/s0369-8114(01)00263-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to {{UN_Population|source}}, Paraguay has a population of {{UN_Population|Paraguay}}, 95% of which are [[mestizo]] (mixed European and Amerindian) and 5% are labelled as "other", which includes members of indigenous tribal groups. They are divided into 17 distinct ethnolinguistic groupings, many of which are poorly documented.

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Paraguay}}
Paraguay is a bilingual nation. Both Spanish and Guaraní are official languages. The Guarani language is a remarkable trace of the indigenous Guaraní culture that has endured in Paraguay, which is generally understood by 95% of the population. Guaraní claims its place as one of the last surviving and thriving of South American indigenous national languages. In 2015, Spanish was spoken by about 87% of the population, while Guaraní is spoken by more than 90%, or slightly more than 5.8 million speakers. 52% of rural Paraguayans are bilingual in Guaraní. While Guaraní is still widely spoken, Spanish is generally given a preferential treatment in government, business, media and education as one of South America's [[lingua francas]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue-list"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/gug Paraguayan Guaraní], Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paraguay |url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/PY-language.htm |title=The Languages spoken in Paraguay |publisher=Studycountry.com |date= |accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitparaguay.net/paraguay-guide/languages-paraguay.html |title=Languages of Paraguay |publisher=VisitParaguay.net |date= |accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SIMON ROMERO|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/world/americas/in-paraguay-indigenous-language-with-unique-staying-power.html |title=In Paraguay, Indigenous Language With Unique Staying Power - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paraguay's cultural heritage can be traced to the extensive [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] between the original male Spanish settlers and indigenous [[Guarani people|Guaraní]] women. Their culture is highly influenced by various European countries, including Spain. Therefore, Paraguayan culture is a fusion of two cultures and traditions; one European, the other, Southern Guaraní. More than 93% of Paraguayans are ''[[mestizos]]'', making Paraguay one of the most homogeneous countries in Latin America. A characteristic of this cultural fusion is the extensive bilingualism present to this day: more than 80% of Paraguayans speak both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the indigenous language, [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]]. [[Jopara]], a mixture of Guaraní and Spanish, is also widely spoken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[File:Ovecha Ragué Festival Paraguay.jpg|thumb|Ovecha Ragué Festival]]
This cultural fusion is expressed in arts such as embroidery (''ao po'í'') and [[Nanduti|lace making]] (''ñandutí''). The [[music of Paraguay]], which consists of lilting polkas, bouncy ''galopas,'' and languid ''[[Guarania (music)|guaranias]]'' is played on the native harp. Paraguay's culinary heritage is also deeply influenced by this cultural fusion. Several popular dishes contain [[manioc]], a local staple crop similar to the [[Cassava|yuca]] also known as Cassava root found in the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Mexico]], as well as other indigenous ingredients. A popular dish is ''[[sopa paraguaya]]'', similar to a thick [[corn bread]]. Another notable food is ''[[chipa]]'', a [[bagel]]-like bread made from [[cornmeal]], manioc, and cheese. Many other dishes consist of different kinds of cheeses, onions, bell peppers, cottage cheese, cornmeal, milk, seasonings, butter, eggs and fresh corn kernels.

The 1950s and 1960s were the time of the flowering of a new generation of Paraguayan novelists and poets such as [[José Ricardo Mazó]], [[Roque Vallejos]], and Nobel Prize nominee [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]. Several [[Cinema of Paraguay|Paraguayan films]] have been made.

Inside the family, conservative values predominate. In lower classes, godparents have a special relationship to the family, since usually, they are chosen because of their favorable social position, in order to provide extra security for the children. Particular respect is owed them, in return for which the family can expect protection and patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/paraguay/29.htm|title=Paraguay - Ritual Kinship|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport in Paraguay}}
Sport in Paraguay is an important part the country's national culture. [[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport, and [[basketball]] is also very popular.&lt;ref name="Paraguay in Pictures"&gt;{{cite book | last = Behnke | first = Alison | title = Paraguay in Pictures | language = English | publisher = VGS - Visual Geography Series| year = 2010 | pages = 56, 57 | isbn = 978-1-57505-962-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sports such as [[volleyball]], [[futsal]], [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[tennis]] are also popular.&lt;ref name="Paraguay in Pictures"/&gt; Additional Paraguayan sports and pastimes include [[rugby union]], [[chess]], [[motorsport]], [[golf]] and [[rowing (sport)|rowing]].

[[Literacy]] was about 93.6% and 87.7% of Paraguayans finish the 5th grade according to [[UNESCO]]'s last Educational Development Index 2008. Literacy does not differ much by gender.&lt;ref name="hdrstats.undp.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_PRY.html |title=Human Development Report 2009 – Paraguay |publisher=Hdrstats.undp.org |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218153913/http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_PRY.html |archivedate=18 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent study&lt;ref name="abc.com.py"/&gt; reveals that attendance at primary school by children between 6 and 12 years old is about 98%. Primary education is free and mandatory and takes nine years. Secondary education takes three years.&lt;ref name="hdrstats.undp.org"/&gt;
Main universities in Paraguay include:
* [[National University of Asunción]] (public and founded in 1889)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.una.py/ |title=::Una:: |publisher=Una.py |accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Universidad Americana]] (private).
* [[Universidad del Pacífico (Paraguay)|Universidad del Pacífico]] (private and founded in 1991).

The net primary enrollment rate was at 88% in 2005.&lt;ref name="hdrstats.undp.org"/&gt; Public expenditure on education was about 4.3% of GDP in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="hdrstats.undp.org"/&gt;

==Health==
{{main|Health in Paraguay}}
Average life expectancy in Paraguay is rather high given its poverty: {{As of|2006|lc=y}}, it was 75 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/countries/pry/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Paraguay |publisher=Who.int |date=1 October 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to far wealthier Argentina, and the 8th highest in the Americas according to World Health Organization. Public expenditure on health is 2.6% of GDP, while private health expenditure is 5.1%.&lt;ref name="hdrstats.undp.org"/&gt; Infant mortality was 20 per 1,000 births in 2005.&lt;ref name="hdrstats.undp.org"/&gt; Maternal mortality was 150 per 100,000 live births in 2000.&lt;ref name="hdrstats.undp.org"/&gt;
The [[World Bank]] has helped the Paraguayan government reduce the country's maternal and infant mortality. The ''Mother and Child Basic Health Insurance Project'' aimed to contribute to reducing mortality by increasing the use of selected life-saving services included in the country's Mother and Child Basic Health Insurance Program (MCBI) by women of child-bearing age, and children under age six in selected areas. To this end, the project also targeted improving the quality and efficiency of the health service network within certain areas, in addition to increasing the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare's (MSPBS) management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&amp;piPK=73230&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;menuPK=228424&amp;Projectid=P082056 "Paraguay Mother &amp; Child Basic Health Insurance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517115828/http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&amp;piPK=73230&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;menuPK=228424&amp;Projectid=P082056 |date=17 May 2012 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1530">The '''Provinces of Eritrea''' existed between [[Eritrea]]'s incorporation as a colony of [[Italy]] until the conversion of the provinces into administrative regions.

==Overview==
In [[Italian Eritrea]], the Italian colonial administration had divided the colony into eight provinces  (administrative regions). These administrative regions relied heavily upon the historical political boundaries in the region, including, but not exclusively, that of local nobility. These Provinces of Eritrea were also used by the Federated Eritrean Government from 1952-1962 and as districts in Eritrea when it was annexed by [[Ethiopia]] from 1962-1991. These eight provinces are enumerated below:

*[[Akele Guzay]]
*[[Barka (Eritrea)|Barka]]
*[[Denkalia]]
*[[Hamasien]]
*[[Sahel (Eritrea)|Sahel]]
*[[Semhar]]
*[[Senhit]]
*[[Seraye]]

After [[Independence Day (Eritrea)|independence]], the Provisional Government of Eritrea converted the original eight Provinces of Eritrea (from the Italian colonial period) to ten provinces by splitting the Barka province in two (the north known as [[Barka (Eritrea)|Barka]] Province and the south as [[Gash-Setit]] Province), while at the same time separating [[Asmara]] from the rest of [[Hamasien]]. On April 15, 1996, the Government of Eritrea converted the then ten Provinces of Eritrea into six administrative regions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20611">[[File:Ancient Beijing observatory 14.jpg|thumb|A large frame quadrant at the [[Beijing Ancient Observatory]].  It was constructed in 1673.]]
A '''quadrant''' is an instrument that is used to measure angles up to 90°. Different versions of this instrument could be used to calculate various readings, such as longitude, latitude, and time of day. It was originally proposed by [[Ptolemy]] as a better kind of [[astrolabe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of the Telescope |first=Henry C. |last=King |publisher=Dover Publications |year=2003 |orig-year=1955 |isbn=978-0-486-43265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several different variations of the instrument were later produced by [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|medieval Muslim astronomers]].

==Etymology==
The term “quadrant”, meaning one fourth, refers to the fact that early versions of the instrument were derived from astrolabes. The quadrant condensed the workings of the astrolabe into an area one fourth the size of the astrolabe face; it was essentially a quarter of an astrolabe.

==History==
[[File:Ptolemy Astrology 1564.jpg|thumb|[[Ptolemy]] using a quadrant]]
One of the earliest accounts of a quadrant comes from [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy's]] Almagest around 150 CE. He described a “plinth” that could measure the altitude of the noon sun by projecting the shadow of a peg on a graduated arc of 90 degrees.&lt;ref name="Quadrant"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackermann|first1=Silke|last2=Van Gent|first2=Robert|title=Quadrant|url=https://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/epact/article.php?ArticleID=14|website=Epact: Scientific Instruments of Medieval and Renaissance Europe|publisher=Museum of the History of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quadrant was unlike later versions of the instrument; it was larger and consisted of several moving parts. Ptolemy’s version was a derivative of the astrolabe and the purpose of this rudimentary device was to measure the meridian angle of the sun.

Islamic astronomers in the Middle Ages improved upon these ideas and constructed quadrants throughout the Middle East, in observatories such as [[Maragheh observatory|Marageh]], [[Rey, Iran|Rey]] and [[Samarkand]]. At first these quadrants were usually very large and stationary, and could be rotated to any bearing to give both the altitude and azimuth for any celestial body.&lt;ref name="Quadrant"/&gt; As Islamic astronomers made advancements in astronomical theory and observational accuracy they are credited with developing four different types of quadrants during the Middle Ages and beyond. The first of these, the sine quadrant, was invented by [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]] in the 9th century at the [[House of Wisdom]] in Baghdad.&lt;ref name=king1987&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=David A.|title=Islamic Astronomical Instruments|date=1987|publisher=Variorum Reprints|location=London|isbn=0860782018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}} The other types were the universal quadrant, the horary quadrant and the astrolabe quadrant.

During the Middle Ages the knowledge of these instruments spread to Europe. In the 13th century Jewish astronomer [[Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon]] was crucial in further developing the quadrant.&lt;ref name="Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Connor|first1=J.J.|title=Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Tibbon.html|website=Tibbon Biography|publisher=University of St. Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a skilled astronomer and wrote several volumes on the topic, including an influential book detailing how to build and use an improved version of the quadrant. The quadrant that he invented came to be known as the “novus quadrans”, or new quadrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Astrolabe Quadrant|url=https://www.astrolabes.org/pages/quadrant.htm|website=Astrolabes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device was revolutionary because it was the first quadrant to be built that did not involve several moving parts and thus could be much smaller and more portable.

Tibbon’s Hebrew manuscripts were translated into Latin and improved upon by French scholar [[Peter Nightingale]] several years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Philomena of Dacia, also known as Petrus Dacus, Petrus Danus, Peter Nightingale |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/peter-philomena-daciaalso-known-petrus-dacus-petrus-danus-peter-nightingale |website=Encyclopedia.com |publisher=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Lindberg|editor-first1=David C.|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1988|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill. [u.a.]|isbn=0226482332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the translation, Tibbon, or Prophatius Judaeus as he was known in Latin, became an influential name in astronomy. His new quadrant was based upon the idea that the stereographic projection that defines a planispheric astrolabe can still work if the astrolabe parts are folded into a single quadrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pedersen|first1=Olaf|title=Early physics and astronomy : a historical introduction |date=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge|isbn=0521408997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a device that was far cheaper, easier to use and more portable than a standard astrolabe. Tibbon’s work had a far reach and influenced [[Copernicus]], [[Christopher Clavius]] and [[Erasmus Reinhold]]; and his manuscript was referenced in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante’s]] [[Divine Comedy]].&lt;ref name="Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon"/&gt;

As the quadrant became smaller and thus more portable, its value for navigation was soon realized. The first documented use of the quadrant to navigate at sea is in 1461, by [[Diogo Gomes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quadrant|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/quadrant.htm|website=Department of Mathematics|publisher=University of Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sailors began by measuring the height of Polaris to ascertain their latitude. This application of quadrants is generally attributed to Arab sailors who traded along the east coast of Africa and often travelled out of sight of land. It soon became more common to take the height of the sun at a given time due to the fact that Polaris disappears south of the equator.

In 1618 English Mathematician [[Edmund Gunter]] further adapted the quadrant with an invention that came to be known as the Gunter quadrant.&lt;ref name=NMAH&gt;{{cite web |title=Gunter Quadrant |url=http://amhistory.si.edu/navigation/type.cfm?typeid=9 |website=National Museum of American History |publisher=Smithsonian |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pocket sized quadrant was revolutionary because it was inscribed with projections of the tropics, the equator, the horizon and the ecliptic. With the correct tables one could use the quadrant to find the time, the date, the length of the day or night, the time of sunrise and sunset and the meridian. The Gunter quadrant was extremely useful but it had its drawbacks; the scales only applied to a certain latitude so the instrument's use was limited at sea.

==Types==
[[File:Tycho-Brahe-Mural-Quadrant.jpg|thumb|Tycho Brahe Mural Quadrant 1598, picturing the two clocks.]]
There are several types of quadrants:
*[[Mural instrument|Mural quadrant]]s, used for determining the time by measuring the altitudes of [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]]s of astronomical objects. [[Tycho Brahe]] created one of the largest mural quadrants. In order to tell time he would place two clocks next to the quadrant so that he could identify the minutes and seconds in relation to the measurements on the side of the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dreyer |first1=John |title=Tycho Brahe |date=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-06871-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Large frame-based instruments used for measuring angular distances between astronomical objects.
*Geometric quadrant used by [[surveying|surveyor]]s and [[navigation|navigator]]s.
*[[Davis quadrant]] a compact, framed instrument used by navigators for measuring the [[altitude]] of an astronomical object.

They can also be classified as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gerard L'E. |last=Turner |title=Antique Scientific Instruments |publisher=Blandford Press Ltd. |year=1980 |isbn=0-7137-1068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Horary-quadrant.jpg|thumb|Horary quadrant for a latitude of about 51.5° as depicted in an instructional text of 1744: ''To find the Hour of the Day: Lay the thread just upon the Day of the Month, then hold it till you slip the small Bead or Pin-head'' [along the thread] ''to rest on one of the 12 o'Clock Lines; then let the Sun shine from the Sight G to the other at D, the Plummet hanging at liberty, the Bead will rest on the Hour of the Day.'']]
*'''Altitude''' - The plain quadrant with plumb line, used to take the [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] of an object.
*'''Gunner's''' - A type of [[clinometer]] used by an [[Artillery|artillerist]] to measure the elevation or depression angle of a gun barrel of a cannon or mortar, both to verify proper firing elevation, and to verify the correct alignment of the weapon-mounted fire control devices. 
*'''Gunter's''' - A quadrant used for time determination as well as the length of day, when the sun had risen and set, the date, and the meridian using scales and curves of the quadrant along with related tables.  It was invented by [[Edmund Gunter]] in 1623.  Gunter's quadrant was fairly simple which allowed for its widespread and long-lasting use in the 17th and 18th centuries.  Gunter expanded the basic features of other quadrants to create a convenient and comprehensive instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=John |title=A Medieval Gunter's Quadrant? |url=http://sundialsoc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bulletin-23iii-Davis.pdf |journal=British Sundial Society Bulletin |volume=23 |issue=iii |date=September 2011 |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its distinguishable feature included projections of the tropics, equator, ecliptic, and the horizon.&lt;ref name=NMAH/&gt;
*'''Islamic''' - King identified four types of quadrants that were produced by Muslim astronomers.&lt;ref name=king1987/&gt;
#'''The [[sine quadrant]]''' (Arabic: Rubul Mujayyab) - also known as the "Sinecal Quadrant" – was used for solving trigonometric problems and taking astronomical observations.  It was developed by al-Khwarizmi in 9th century Baghdad and prevalent until the nineteenth century.  Its defining feature is a graph-paper like grid on one side that is divided into sixty equal intervals on each axis and is also bounded by a 90 degree graduated arc. A cord was attached to the apex of the quadrant with a bead, for calculation, and a plumb bob.  They were also sometimes drawn on the back of astrolabes.
#'''The universal (shakkāzīya) quadrant''' – used for solving astronomical problems for any latitude: These quadrants had either one or two sets of shakkāzīya grids and were developed in the fourteenth century in Syria. Some [[astrolabes]] are also printed on the back with the universal quadrant like an astrolabe created by Ibn al-Sarrāj.
#'''The horary quadrant''' – used for finding the time with the sun: The horary quadrant could be used to find the time either in equal or unequal (length of the day divided by twelve) hours. Different sets of markings were created for either equal or unequal hours. For measuring the time in equal hours, the horary quadrant could only be used for one specific latitude while a quadrant for unequal hours could be used anywhere based on an approximate formula. One edge of the quadrant had to be aligned with the sun, and once aligned, a bead on the plumbline attached to the centre of the quadrant showed the time of the day. An example exists dated 1396, from European sources ([[Richard II]] of England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-09/one-man27s-trash-is-another27s-centuries-old-treasure/3654974 |title=14th century timepiece unearthed in Qld farm shed |author=Clayton Bloom |date=9 November 2011 |website=[[ABC News Online]] |access-date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest horary quadrant was found during an excavation in 2013 in the Hanseatic town of [[Zutphen]] (Netherlands), is dated ca. 1300, and is in the local Stedelijk Museum in Zutphen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Davis |title=The Zutphen Quadrant – A Very Early Equal-Hour Instrument Excavated in The Netherlands |journal=British Sundial Society Bulletin |volume=26 |issue=i |url=http://www.flowton-dials.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Zutphen-quadrant-Bull-26i.pdf |date=March 2014 |pages=36-42 |access-date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fermin |first=B. |first2=D. |last2=Kastelein |title=Het Zutphense Kwadrant.

#'''The astrolabe/[[almucantar]] quadrant''' – a quadrant developed from the astrolabe: This quadrant was marked with one half of a typical astrolabe plate as astrolabe plates are symmetrical. A cord attached from the centre of the quadrant with a bead at the other end was moved to represent the position of a celestial body (sun or a star). The ecliptic and star positions were marked on the quadrant for the above. It is not known where and when the astrolabe quadrant was invented, existent astrolabe quadrants are either of Ottoman or Mamluk origin, while there have been discovered twelfth century Egyptian and fourteenth century Syrian treatises on the astrolabe quadrant. These quadrants proved to be very popular alternatives to astrolabes.

The geometric quadrant is a quarter-circle panel usually of wood or brass.  Markings on the surface might be printed on paper and pasted to the wood or painted directly on the surface.  Brass instruments had their markings scribed directly into the brass.

For marine navigation, the earliest examples were found around 1460.  They were not [[graduation (instrument)|graduated]] in degrees but rather had the [[latitude]]s of the most common destinations directly scribed on the [[wiktionary:Limb#Etymology 2|limb]].  When in use, the navigator would sail north or south until the quadrant indicated he was at the destination's latitude, turn in the direction of the destination and sail to the destination maintaining a course of constant latitude.  After 1480, more of the instruments were made with limbs graduated in degrees.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{cite book |last=May |first=William Edward |title=A History of Marine Navigation |publisher={{nowrap| G. T. Foulis}} &amp; Co. Ltd. |location=Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire |year=1973 |isbn=0-85429-143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along one edge there were two sights forming an [[alidade]].  A [[plumb bob]] was suspended by a line from the centre of the arc at the top.

In order to measure the [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]] of a star, the observer would view the star through the sights and hold the quadrant so that the plane of the instrument was vertical.  The plumb bob was allowed to hang vertical and the line indicated the reading on the arc's [[Graduation (instrument)|graduation]]s.  It was not uncommon for a second person to take the reading while the first concentrated on observing and holding the instrument in proper position.

The accuracy of the instrument was limited by its size and by the effect the wind or observer's motion would have on the plumb bob.  For navigators on the deck of a moving ship, these limitations could be difficult to overcome.

===Solar observations===
[[File:Back-observation-quadrant.png|thumb|Drawing of a back observation quadrant.  This instrument was used in the manner of a backstaff to measure the elevation of the sun by observing the position of a shadow on the instrument.]]
In order to avoid staring into the sun to measure its altitude, navigators could hold the instrument in front of them with the sun to their side.  By having the sunward sighting vane cast its shadow on the lower sighting vane, it was possible to align the instrument to the sun.  Care would have to be taken to ensure that the altitude of the centre of the sun was determined.  This could be done by averaging the elevations of the upper and lower [[umbra]] in the shadow.

===Back observation quadrant===

In order to perform measurements of the altitude of the sun, a back observation quadrant was developed.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;

With such a quadrant, the observer viewed the horizon from a ''sight vane'' (C in the figure on the right) through a slit in the ''horizon vane'' (B).  This ensured the instrument was level.  The observer moved the ''shadow vane'' (A) to a position on the graduated scale so as to cause its shadow to appear coincident with the level of the horizon on the horizon vane.  This angle was the elevation of the sun.

==Framed quadrant==
Large frame quadrants were used for astronomical measurements, notably determining the [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]] of [[Astronomical object|celestial]] objects.  They could be permanent installations, such as [[mural instrument|mural quadrant]]s.  Smaller quadrants could be moved.  Like the similar [[sextant (astronomical)#Framed sextants|astronomical sextant]]s, they could be used in a vertical plane or made adjustable for any plane.

When set on a [[pedestal]] or other mount, they could be used to measure the angular distance between any two celestial objects.

The details on their construction and use are essentially the same as those of the [[sextant (astronomical)#Framed sextants|astronomical sextant]]s; refer to that article for details.

Navy:  Used to gauge elevation on ships cannon, the quadrant had to be placed on each gun's trunnion in order to judge range, after the loading.  The reading was taken at the top of the ship's roll, the gun adjusted,and checked, again at the top of the roll, and he went to the next gun, until all that were going to be fired were ready.  The ship's Gunner was informed, who in turn informed the captain...You may fire when ready...at the next high roll, the cannon would be fired.

In more modern applications, the quadrant is attached to the trunion ring or of a large naval gun to align it to benchmarks welded to the ship's deck.  This is done to ensure firing of the gun hasn't "warped the deck."  A flat surface on the mount gunhouse or turret is also checked against benchmarks, also, to ensure large bearings and/or bearing races haven't changed... to "calibrate" the gun.

==Customization==

During the Middle Ages, makers often added customization to impress the person for whom the quadrant was intended. In large, unused spaces on the instrument, a sigil or badge would often be added to denote the ownership by an important person or the allegiance of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Silke Ackermann |last-author-amp=yes |author2=John Cherry |title=Richard II, John Holland and Three Medieval Quadrants |journal=Annals of Science |volume=56 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=3-23 |doi=10.1080/000337999296508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rainbow Group''', officially the '''Rainbow Group: Federation of the Green Alternative European Links, Agalev-Ecolo, the Danish People's Movement against Membership of the European Community, and the European Free Alliance, in the European Parliament''' was a [[Green politics|green]] and [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political group]] with seats in the [[European Parliament]] between 1984 and 1989.

==History==
The Rainbow Group,&lt;ref name="t1s3"/&gt; was formed in 1984&lt;ref name="t1s11"/&gt; as a coalition of Greens, Regionalists and other parties of the left unaffiliated with any of the international organizations. 

The [[Alliance '90/The Greens|German Greens]] and the Dutch [[GreenLeft|Green Progressive Alliance]] were used a principle of rotation used by the Germany and Dutch parties, requiring its MEPs to sit for only half their five-year term.

In 1989&lt;ref name="t1s11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="t1s3"/&gt; the Rainbow Group split. The green parties formed the [[The Green Group in the European Parliament|Green Group]], whilst the regionalist parties stayed a continuing Rainbow group, with the shorter official name of the [[Rainbow Group (1989–94)|Rainbow Group in the European Parliament]].

{{History of the Philippines}}
The '''Rajahnate of Butuan''' (also called as '''Kingdom of Butuan'''; [[Butuanon language|Butuanon]]: ''Gingharian hong Butuan'', {{lang-ceb|Gingharian sa Butuan}}, {{lang-fil|Kaharian ng Butuan/Karahanan ng Butuan}}, [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 蒲端國, ''Púduānguó'' in Chinese records), was an [[Mandala (political model)|Indic polity]] centered on present [[Mindanao]] island in the modern city of [[Butuan]] in what is now the southern [[Philippines]]. It was known for its mining of gold, its gold products and its extensive trade network across the [[Nusantara]] area. The kingdom had trading relationships with the ancient civilizations of [[Japan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Persia]], [[Cambodia]] and areas now comprised in [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2071/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[balangay]] (large outrigger boats) that have been found along the east and west banks of the [[Agusan River|Libertad river (old Agusan River)]] have revealed much about Butuan's history. As a result, Butuan is considered to have been a major trading port in the [[Caraga]] region during the pre-colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Discovering the Ancient Kingdom of Butuan  |url=http://www.philstar.com/ArticlePrinterFriendly.aspx?articleId=437256|first=Sia|last=Lealiz|date=February 4, 2009|publisher=The Philippine Star|accessdate=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
===Chinese records===

[[File:East-Hem 1200ad.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The world in 1200 AD: The Butuan Rajahnate and its neighbors.]]
Evidence indicates that Butuan was in contact with the [[Song dynasty]] of [[China]] by at least 1001 AD. The Chinese annal [[History of Song|''Song Shih'']] recorded the first appearance of a Butuan tributary mission (Li Yui-han 李竾罕 and Jiaminan) at the Chinese Imperial Court on March 17, 1001 AD and it described Butuan (''P'u-tuan'') as a small Hindu country with a Buddhist monarchy in the sea that had a regular connection with the [[Champa]] kingdom and intermittent contact with China under the [[Rajah]] named Kiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Timeline of history|url=http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm|accessdate=2009-10-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123061819/http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm|archivedate=2009-11-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rajah sent an envoy under I-hsu-han, with a formal [[Official Communications of the Chinese Empire#Memorials|memorial]] requesting equal status in court protocol with the Champa envoy. The request was denied later by the Imperial court, mainly because of favoritism over Champa.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Henry Scott (historian)|Scott, William]] ''Prehispanic Source Materials: For the Study of Philippine History'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

A new ruler with the Indianized name Sri Bata Shaja later succeeded in attaining diplomatic equality with Champa by sending the flamboyant ambassador Likanhsieh. Likanhsieh shocked the [[Emperor Zhenzong]] by presenting a memorial engraved on a gold tablet, some [[Chinese dragon|white dragon]] (''Bailong'' 白龍) [[camphor]], [[Moluccas|Moluccan]] cloves, and a [[South China Sea|South Sea]] slave at the eve of an important ceremonial state sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;''Song Shih'' Chapter 7 to 8&lt;/ref&gt; This display of [[irreverence]] sparked interests from China over the small Rajahnate and the diplomatic relations between the two polities reached its peak during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Chinese records about the Rajahnate stopped after the reign of Rajah Colambu, the last independent Rajah of Butuan. He was formally subjugated into the Spanish Empire after he made a [[blood compact]] with [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1521.

===Philippine records===
The discovery of the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]] proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with suyat inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time.&lt;ref&gt;http://paulmorrow.ca/bayeng1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.brown.edu/alioshabp/some-background-on-baybayin-a-pre-hispanic-filipino-script/&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous jars have been found in the Butuan area that indicate the wealth of the kingdom and the existence of foreign traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Luna| first = Lillian| title = MAPEH for Secondary Students| publisher = St Bernadette Publications Inc.| series = Art Books and History Books| year = 2004| doi = | isbn = 971-621-327-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these jars have been dated as follows:

Artifacts have been recovered from within the vicinities of [[Butuan City|Ambangan Archeological Site in Libertad]] that attest to the historical accounts that Butuan traded with [[Indian people|India]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebulwaganfoundation.wordpress.com/2010/09/01/the-kingdom-of-butuan/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japanese people|Japan]], [[Han Chinese]], and Southeast Asian countries during these periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the name==
[[File:Köhler's Medizinal-Pflanzen in naturgetreuen Abbildungen mit kurz erläuterndem Texte (Plate 179) (8231755755).jpg|thumb|125px|An illustration of the ''Garcinia morella'', locally called ''batuan'', one of which might Butuan's name came from.]]
The name ''Butuan'' is believed to have existed long before the Spanish [[conquistador]]es arrived in the Philippine archipelago. One possible indication of this is a rhinoceros ivory seal with design carved in ancient Javanese or early [[Kawi script]] (used around the 10th century CE) which, according to a Dutch scholar, was deciphered as ''But-wan''. Another account suggests the name derives from the word ''[[Garcinia morella|batuan]]'', a [[mangosteen]]-related fruit common in Mindanao. Another alternative is that the name derives from Datu Bantuan, possibly a former [[datu]] of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://butuancity.info/about-butuan/92-historic-butuan.html|title=Historic Butuan |accessdate=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rimbor''' is a [[fictional planet]] in the 30th century [[DC Universe]], best known as the home planet for [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] member [[Ultra Boy]]. It is a member world part of the [[United Planets]].

==Fictional history==
Rimbor has a reputation as a rough, lawless planet where crime and corruption run rampant. It is inhabited by members of several different races, including humans. No single race seems to dominate Rimbor, implying that it may be a United Planets colony world with no indigenous population.
Gang violence is commonplace and keeps the [[Science Police]] and government of Rimbor busy and largely prevents them from making more headway in cleaning up the world. One of if not its most famous denizens is Jo Nah, the Legionnaire called Ultra Boy. He was formerly a member of the Emerald Dragons, one of the most prominent gangs on Rimbor.

For some unexplained reason, most people on Rimbor have names that follow a certain pattern:  The first name consists of two letters, and the last name of three.  Examples:  "Jo Nah" (Ultra Boy), "An Ryd", "Mo Seh", etc.  There have been exceptions, however.

===Reboot===
In the Post-[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]] reboot it was established that Rimborians had different organ placement inside their body than Earthlings despite their heritage. The Legionnaire [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]] was also from Rimbor in addition to Ultra Boy. They are rival gang leaders in this continuity (Ultra Boy led a gang called the Emerald Dragons, Timber Wolf led a gang called the Lone Wolves). There is a love triangle between himself, Ultra Boy and [[Phantom Girl|Apparition]], as he met Apparition while Ultra Boy was part of the team lost in the Second Galaxy, and formed a strong connection with her. Timber Wolf later realized his feelings for Apparition were only those of a friend, but Ultra Boy remained jealous.

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the show [[Legion of Superheroes]] Rimbor is mentioned in the episode "Legacy" that [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]] is on a solo mission there.
* In the animated series ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]],'' the [[Justice League]] are put under mind control by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Light]] for about a day, during which time six members ([[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batman]], [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Hawkwoman]] and [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]) are sent to Rimbor to cause wanton destruction for sixteen hours. This leads the rest of the galaxy to consider Earth a potential threat or tool, resulting in numerous aliens arriving during the second season; meanwhile, the six League members willingly travel to Rimbor to stand trial, and ultimately, clear their names. 
* In the [[Supergirl (TV series)|''Supergirl'']] episode "Star-Crossed", [[Jonathan Groff]] is mentioned to be from Rimbor.

'''Roden Crater''' is a [[cinder cone]] type of [[volcanic cone]] from an extinct [[volcano]], with a remaining interior [[volcanic crater]]. It is located northeast of the city of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] in northern [[Arizona]], United States.

==Art project==
The artist [[James Turrell]], for his [[land art]] project, acquired the 400,000-year-old,  {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=mid|-wide}} crater's land.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasersol.com/art/turrell/roden_crater.html ''Roden Crater project info''&lt;/ref&gt; Turrell has since been transforming the inner cone of the crater into a massive naked-eye observatory, designed specifically for viewing and experiencing  sky-light, solar, and celestial phenomena. The fleeting winter and summer [[solstice]] events will be highlighted.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jullia. "Occluded Front, James Turrell".

==Future==
The [[Dia Art Foundation]] is continuing to advocate for the development of  James Turrell's Roden Crater project in the [[Painted Desert (Arizona)|Painted Desert]] in Arizona which was begun in the 1970s with Dia's support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diacenter.org/contents/page/101/102 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613070609/http://diacenter.org/contents/page/101/102 |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }} ''Dia Art Foundation''&lt;/ref&gt;  James Turrell, who purchased the Roden Crater in 1979, had plans to open the crater for public viewing in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/arts/design/25fink.html?ref=arts ''11/25/2007-New York Times article''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visiting==
A limited number of visitors can visit Roden Crater for a donation of $ 5000 to the Skystone Foundation, Turrell’s nonprofit organization&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artnews.com/2015/02/19/james-turrell-allowing-limited-visitors-to-roden-crater-for-6500-a-person/ ARTnews 02.19.2015&lt;/ref&gt; An additional $1,500 will cover a hotel room, a tour, dinner onsite, and breakfast the following morning.

'''Sohae Satellite Launching Station''' ({{korean|hangul=서해위성발사장|hanja=西海衛星發射場|mr=Sohae Wisŏng Palsajang|context=north}}, also known as '''Tongch'ang-dong Space Launch Center''' and '''Pongdong-ri''') is a rocket launching site in [[Cholsan|Cholsan County]], [[North Pyongan]] Province, [[North Korea]]. The base is located among hills close to the northern border with [[China]]. The spaceport was built on the site of the village Pongdong-ri which was displaced during construction. It was the site for the 13 April 2012 launch of the North Korean satellite [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3]], which was launched to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of [[Kim Il-Sung]].&lt;ref name="naenara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dprk"/&gt; The rocket launch failed, but on 12 December of the same year [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2]] was successfully launched and brought into Earth orbit.

The launches were controversial as they were dismissed by the US as tests of [[ballistic missile]] technology and hence of breach of an agreement made between North Korea and the USA in February 2012.&lt;ref name="dprk2"/&gt;

During the [[2018 North Korea–United States summit]], Kim Jong-un promised that North Korea would destroy a missile engine test stand soon. The site was not initially named but was later identified to be the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground by US officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spetalnick |first1=Matt |title=U.S. identifies North Korea missile test site it says Kim committed... |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-site/u-s-identifies-north-korea-missile-test-site-it-says-kim-committed-to-destroy-idUSKBN1JH02B |website=Reuters |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pledge was made official as part of the Pyongyang Declaration which Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-In signed at the [[September_2018_inter-Korean_summit#September_19_(Day_2)|September 2018 inter-Korean summit]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/09/19/kim-jong-un-moon-jae-sign-agreement-peace/1355006002/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Signs of construction were visible during the early 1990s and became more pronounced by the early 2000s. A major progress in the construction was discovered in 2008 by [[Jane's Information Group]], which requested imagery from the satellite company [[DigitalGlobe]]. Movements from the Sanum’dong missile research factory with the erector transporter and railroad, road transportation to the space center of a prototype [[Unha-3]] class booster first two stages initially took place over 29–31 May 2009 possibly for logistics testing as well as personnel facilities infrastructure testing training purposes. The results of those tests suggest that military and design specialists ultimately decided to build a facilities access railroad to cut down the 15 kilometer road access logistics issues to the space center.

By early 2011 it was reported that the construction was completed and that it had been under construction for a decade.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; The first official mention of the site took place in March 2012 when North Korea announced it will launch from that site the satellite [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3]]. On April 2012, prior to the launch of the satellite, Jang Myong-jin, director of the Sohae, introduced the launching process of the [[Unha-3]] rocket (Korean: 은하-3호, 銀河-3) during a guided media tour.&lt;ref name="mail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="naenara2"/&gt;

The first launch of Kwangmyongsong-3 on 12 April 2012 failed. On 1 December 2012, the Korean Central News Agency announced that a [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2|second version]] of Kwangmyongsong-3 was to be launched from Sohae between 10–22 December 2012.&lt;ref name="zarya-32"/&gt; North Korea declared the launch successful, and the South Korean military and [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) reported that initial indications suggested that an object had achieved orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50167891/ns/technology_and_science-space/|title=North Korea reports successful launch of controversial rocket|publisher=MSN/NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norad.mil/News/2012/121112b.html |title=NORAD acknowledges missile launch |publisher=North American Aerospace Defense Command |date=11 December 2012 |accessdate=12 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214134546/http://www.norad.mil/News/2012/121112b.html |archivedate=14 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea had previously claimed the [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1]] and [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2]] launches successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Encyclopedia Astronautica|title=1998.08.31 - Kwangmyŏngsŏng 1|url=http://www.astronautix.com/details/kwa11163.htm|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=N.Korea says it successfully launched satellite|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/04/05/idUKSEO88417|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite American military sources confirming that they failed to achieve orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Northern Command|title=NORAD and USNORTHCOM monitor North Korean launch|url=http://www.northcom.mil/News/2009/040509.html|accessdate=15 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017015121/http://www.northcom.mil/News/2009/040509.html|archivedate=17 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=North Korea space launch 'fails'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7984254.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==

The entire facility occupies over six square kilometers, and consists of a launch site, a static rocket motor test stand, vehicle checkout and processing buildings, a launch control building, a large support area, a complex headquarters building and an entry control point. The site is five times larger than Tonghae Launch Site.&lt;ref name="kherald"/&gt; There is much speculation about the functions of different parts of the site &lt;ref name="msnbc"/&gt; but the nuances of satellite photography based guesswork may not be communicated effectively in the mass media.

Western sources identified a building as a "high bay processing facility" which turned out to be the launch control centre when the site was visited by journalists. The building previously identified as the control centre was actually an observation point.&lt;ref name="msnbc"/&gt;

==Dismantlement and International Inspection==
In July 2018, North Korea began dismantling the Sohae Satellite Launching Station.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/23/north-korea-begins-dismantling-key-test-site-satellite-imagery-suggests/?utm_term=.185bd31ee091&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite images taken between July 20 and 22 showed the destruction of a rocket engine test stand used to develop liquid-fuel engines for ballistic missiles, space-launch vehicles and a rail-mounted processing building where space launch vehicles were assembled before being moved to the launch pad&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-dismantling-sohae-satellite-launch-site-38-north-denuclearization/&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial satellite imagery from August 3, 2018 confirmed that additional dismantlement activities were taking place at Sohae as well, including the destruction of facility's vertical engine test stand and fuel/oxidizer bunkers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.38north.org/2018/08/sohae080718/&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jung-Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-In signed the "Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018", which, among other things, pledged for North Korea to complete its dismantlement of Sohae and allow foreign experts to observe the dismantling of the missile engine testing site and a launch pad.&lt;ref name=oct31observer&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/31/north-korea-reportedly-readies-nuclear-missile-sites-for-inspectors.html&lt;/ref&gt; By October 10, 2018, commercial satellite imagery confirmed that the site's legacy fuel/oxidizer bunker located at the launch pad had been largely removed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.38north.org/2018/10/sohae101018/&lt;/ref&gt; Officials from South Korea's National Intelligence Service who visited the site on October 31, 2018 stated that Sohae was in fact being dismantled and was ready for an upcoming international inspection.&lt;ref name=oct31observer /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7839">In Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the '''Third Heaven''' is a division of [[Heaven]] in [[religious cosmology]].  In some traditions it is considered the [[Throne of God|abode of God]],&lt;ref name="mthen"&gt;Henry, Matthew, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc6.viii.xiii.html ''Commentary on the Whole Bible Volume VI (Acts to Revelation)'': Second Corinthians Chap. XII] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825122614/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc6.viii.xiii.html |date=2006-08-25 }}, Public domain, Library of Congress call no: BS490.H4, at [http://www.ccel.org/ Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt; and in others a lower level of [[Paradise]], commonly [[Seven Heavens|one of seven]].&lt;ref name = "lj"&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909) [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm ''The Legends of the Jews''], Chapter 1, at [http://www.sacred-texts.com/index.htm sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
The early books of the [[Tanakh]] reference [[Heaven]] (Heb. ''[[Heaven in Judaism|Shamayim]]''), but not a Third Heaven or a specific number of heavens.&lt;ref name="mthen"/&gt; Heaven is mentioned several times in the first chapter of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. It appears in the first verse as a creation of God. His dividing the light from the darkness in verses 4 and 5 this has been interpreted as the separation of heaven into two sections: day (God's throne) and night (where our universe is contained). In verse 8 heaven refers to the atmosphere over the earth in which birds fly, and in verse 14 it's the setting for the celestial lights, later identified (verse 16) as the [[sun]], [[moon]] and [[star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See a good Commentary on Youtube (Ruckman, Andrew Gen. 1 part 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

A third concept of Heaven, also called ''shamayi h'shamayim'' (שׁמי השׁמים or "Heaven of Heavens"), is mentioned in such passages as [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 28:12, [[Deuteronomy]] 10:14 and [[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 8:27 as a distinctly spiritual realm containing (or being traveled by) [[angel]]s and God.&lt;ref&gt;van der Toorn, Becking, van der Horst (1999), ''Dictionary of Deities and Demons in The Bible'', Second Extensively Revised Edition, Entry: ''Heaven'', pp. 388–390, William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0-8028-2491-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambiguity of the term ''shamayim'' in the Hebrew Bible, and the fact that it's a plural word, give "heavens" various interpretations regarding its nature, notably the [[Elijah#Ascension into the heavens|ascension of the prophet Elijah]].

In the non-canonical [[Second Book of Enoch]], Third Heaven is described as a location "between corruptibility and incorruptibility" containing the [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)|Tree of Life]], "whereon the Lord rests, when he goes up into paradise." (chapter 8) Two springs in the Third Heaven, one of milk and the other of honey, along with two others of wine and oil, flow down into the [[Garden of Eden]]. (verse 6) In contrast with the common concept of [[Paradise]], the [[Second Book of Enoch]] also describes it as "a very terrible place" for those who do wrong, with "all manner of tortures" inflicted by merciless angels on "those who dishonour God, who on earth practice sin against nature," including [[Sodomy|sodomites]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerers]], [[Incantation|enchanters]], [[Witchcraft|witches]], the proud, thieves, liars and those guilty of various other transgressions. (chapter 10)

In the [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]] version of the ''Greek Apocalypse of Baruch'', also known as [[3 Baruch]], the author is shown a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], and a [[dragon]] residing there is said to eat the bodies of "those that have spent their lives in evil."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=329&amp;letter=B Baruch, Apocalypse of] at [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/ jewishencyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Legends of the Jews'' by [[Louis Ginzberg]], this third division of Paradise is said to be, like the other six, "twelve myriads of miles in width and twelve myriads of miles in length,"  built of silver and gold, and containing "the best of everything there is in heaven."&lt;ref name="lj"/&gt;

===Residents===
Aside from the redeemed, the transgressors and various angels mentioned in the Bible and other Hebrew literature, a number of specific figures and spirits are mentioned as residing in the Third Heaven. According to ''The [[Legends of the Jews]]'' by [[Louis Ginzberg]] these include:&lt;ref name = "lj"/&gt;
* [[Abraham]]
* [[Isaac]]
* [[Jacob]]
* [[Moses]]
* [[Aaron]]
* [[Azrael]]
* the [[Israelite]]s of the [[The Exodus|Exodus]]
* the kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (notably [[David]], but "with the exception of [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], the son of [[Hezekiah]], who presides in the second division, over the penitents")

==Christianity==

===New Testament===
In [[2 Corinthians]] [[Paul the Apostle]] writes, "I know a person in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows. And I know that such a person—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows—was caught up into Paradise and heard things that are not to be told, that no mortal is permitted to repeat."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|2 Corinthians|12:2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[E. W. Bullinger]], the Greek says "caught away", not "caught up" possibly reflecting Jewish beliefs that Paradise was somewhere other than the uppermost heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[[E. W. Bullinger]] A Critical Lexicon and Concordance to the English and Greek  "2, 14, To this "Third heaven" and " Paradise " Paul was caught away, 2 Cor. xii. 2, 4, (not " up," see under " catch,") in "visions and revelations of the Lord," 2 Cor. xii. 1. One catching away – with a double revelation of the New heaven and the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas about [[Religious cosmology|the system of "heavens"]] held by Jews and Christians in first-century communities are also evident in the non-canonical [[Second Book of Enoch]] (see previous section). 

===New Testament apocrypha===
According to the ''[[First Apocalypse of James|Apocalypse of James]]'',&lt;ref name = "da"&gt;Davidson, Gustav (1967), ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/A_dictionary_of_angels.html?id=Ed7yHWuTEewC A Dictionary of Angels, Including The Fallen Angels]'', Entry: '''Third Heaven''', Free Press, p. 288, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 66-19757, {{ISBN|9780029070505}}&lt;/ref&gt; John the Baptist dwells in the Third Heaven.

==Islam==
According to [[Islam]]ic tradition, [[Muhammad]]'s [[Isra and Miraj|Mi'raj]] (ascension through the heavens) included an admission to the Third Heaven by the angel [[Gabriel]], in which he met [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], who received him warmly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muslim-canada.org/miraj_dictionaryofislam.html Mi'raj] at the [http://muslim-canada.org/ Canadian Society of Muslims Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic tradition also places [[Azrael]], the angel of death, in the Third Heaven.&lt;ref name="da"/&gt; The third heaven is depicted as being constructed of pearl and/or other luminous metals.

According to [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] sources, the Third Heaven is named '''''Marum''''' ({{lang-ar|ماروم}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al-Burhan fi Tafsir al-Qur'an|location=V. 5|pages=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wakhjir Pass,'''&lt;ref name=adamecp185&gt;[[Ludwig W. Adamec]]. Historical and political gazetteer of Afghanistan Vol. 1. Badakhshan Province and northeastern Afghanistan. [[Graz]] : Akad. Druck- und Verl.-Anst., 1972.p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; also spelled '''Vakhjir Pass''', is a [[mountain pass]] in the [[Hindu Kush]] or [[Pamirs]] at the eastern end of the [[Wakhan Corridor]], the only pass between [[Afghanistan]] and [[China]].  It links [[Wakhan]] in Afghanistan with the [[Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County]] in [[Xinjiang]], China, at an altitude of {{convert|4923|m|ft}},&lt;ref name="border_agreement"/&gt; but the pass is not an official border crossing point.  The border has the sharpest official change of clocks of any international frontier ([[UTC+4:30]] in Afghanistan to [[UTC+8]], [[Time in China|in China]]). China refers to the pass as ''South Wakhjir Pass'' ({{zh|c=南瓦根基达坂}}), as there is a northern pass on the Chinese side.&lt;ref name="border_agreement"&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=中华人民共和国和阿富汗王国边界条约 |trans_title=China-Afghanistan Border Agreement |wslanguage=zh|quote=经过高程为4923米的南瓦根基达坂（阿方图称瓦根基山口）|date=1963-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Afghan side, the nearest road is a rough road to [[Sarhad-e Wakhan]] (also known as Sarhad-e Broghil), about {{convert|100|km|mi}} from the pass by paths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mockandoneil.com/stg04r3.htm#faizabad J.

This is the source of the Wakhjir River, which ultimately flows to the [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus). The cave is therefore claimed as a source of the Amu Darya. [[Dilisang Pass]], to Pakistan, is in the same valley about {{convert|20|km|mi}} away.&lt;ref name="juldu"/&gt;

==History==
Wakhjir Pass is part of the [[Silk Road]]. It is believed that the famous Chinese Buddhist pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] traveled via this pass on his return trip to China in approximately [[649 AD]].&lt;ref name="book_Unit"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are few records of successful crossings by foreigners.  Historically the pass was a trading route between [[Badakhshan]] and [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]], used by merchants from [[Bajaor]].&lt;ref name=Stein/&gt; It appears that [[Marco Polo]] came this way, although he did not mention the pass by name.  The Jesuit priest [[Benedict Goëz]] crossed from the Wakhan to China between 1602 and 1606. The next oldest accounts are from the period of [[the Great Game]] in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Shahrani, M. Nazif. (1979) ''The Kirghiz and Wakhi of Afghanistan: Adaptation to Closed Frontiers and War'' University of Washington Press, Seattle, {{ISBN|0-295-95669-0}}; 1st paperback edition with new preface and epilogue (2002), {{ISBN|0-295-98262-4}} p.27&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1868, a [[pundit (explorer)|pundit]] known as the Mirza, working for the [[Great Trigonometric Survey]] of [[India]], crossed the pass.&lt;ref&gt;Shahrani, M. Nazif. (1979 and 2002) p.31&lt;/ref&gt;  There were further crossings in 1874 by Captain [[Thomas Edward Gordon|T.E. Gordon]] of the British Army,&lt;ref&gt;Keay, J. (1983) ''When Men and Mountains Meet'' {{ISBN|0-7126-0196-1}} p. 256-7&lt;/ref&gt; in 1891 by [[Francis Younghusband]],&lt;ref&gt;Younghusband, F. (1896, republished 2000) ''The Heart of a Continent'' {{ISBN|978-1-4212-6551-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1894 by [[Lord Curzon]].&lt;ref&gt;''Geographical Journal'' (July to September 1896) cited in [http://www.mockandoneil.com/stg04app.htm Mock and O'Neil 2004 Shipton Tilman Grant Application]&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1906 Sir Aurel Stein crossed, and reported that at that time the pass was used by only 100 pony loads of goods each way annually.&lt;ref name="Shahrani, M. Nazif 2002 p.37"&gt;Shahrani, M. Nazif (1979 and 2002) p.37&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then the only Westerner to have crossed the pass seems to have been [[Bill Tilman|H.W. Tilman]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mockandoneil.com/stg04app.htm Mock and O'Neil 2004 Shipton Tilman Grant Application]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 the pass was established as the border between China and Afghanistan in an agreement between the British and the Russians, although the Chinese and Afghans did not finally agree on the border until 1963.&lt;ref name="border_agreement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="web._"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan has asked [[People's Republic of China|China]] on several occasions to open the border in the Wakhan Corridor for economic reasons or as an alternative supply route for fighting the [[Taliban insurgency]]. However, China has resisted, largely due to unrest in its far western province of [[Xinjiang]], which borders the corridor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200906111512.htm Afghanistan tells China to open Wakhan corridor route].
