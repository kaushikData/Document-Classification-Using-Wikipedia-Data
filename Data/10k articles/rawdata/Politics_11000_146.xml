In early 2013, an Indian national parliamentary investigation began into allegations of bribery and corruption involving several senior officials and a helicopter manufacturer [[AgustaWestland]] surrounding the purchase of a new fleet of helicopters. The scandal has been referred to as the '''Chopper scam''' or '''Choppergate''' by elements of the media and popular press.&lt;ref name="SEARCH RESULTS FOR Choppergate"&gt;{{cite news|title=SEARCH RESULTS FOR Choppergate|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/advanced_search.jsp?searchword=Choppergate&amp;searchtype=text&amp;search_type=article|accessdate=4 March 2013|newspaper=India Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Indian politicians and military officials have been accused of accepting bribes from AgustaWestland in order to win the {{INRConvert|36|b}} Indian contract for the supply of 12 [[AgustaWestland AW101]] helicopters; these helicopters are intended to perform VVIP duties for the [[President of India]] and other important state officials.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news |last= Kumar|first= Vinay|title=Chopper scam: Long-drawn legal battle ahead |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chopper-scam-longdrawn-legal-battle-ahead/article4428630.ece |work= The Hindu |date= 18 February 2013 |accessdate=25 February 2013 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ahmed Patel]], political secretary to Congress President [[Sonia Gandhi]], is alleged by Italian prosecutors to have received kickbacks from the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/does-ap-mean-ahmed-patel-asks-prosecutor-in-italy-court-middleman-says-dont-know/|title=Does AP mean Ahmed Patel, asks prosecutor in Italy court; middleman says don’t know|date=10 January 2014|work=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; A note presented in the Italian court, sent by middleman Christian Michel, asks Peter Hulett, an AgustaWestland employee, to target key advisors to Sonia Gandhi and lists their names as Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]], Ahmed Patel, [[Pranab Mukherjee]], [[Veerappa Moily|M.

On 25 March 2013, India's Defence Minister A.K. Antony confirmed corruption allegations by stating: "Yes, corruption has taken place in the helicopter deal and bribes have been taken. The CBI is pursuing the case very vigorously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bribes were taken in the VVIP helicopter deal, admits Defence Minister AK Antony|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/chopper-scam-helcopter-deal-was-tainted-admits-ak-antony/1/259311.html|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=India today|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2014, the Indian government has recovered a total amount of {{INR}}2,068 crore&lt;ref name="India recovers Rs.1,818 crore from AgustaWestland"/&gt; and has recovered around {{INR}}1,620 crore (45% of the total contract value {{INR}}3,600 crore) it had paid to AgustaWestland.&lt;ref name="India Scraps Rs.3,600 crore AgustaWestland Chopper Deal"/&gt;

On 8 April 2016, the Milan Court of Appeal, in a 225-page judgement, overturned a lower court verdict and convicted helicopter manufacturer AgustaWestland's executive [[Giuseppe Orsi]] to four years' imprisonment for paying a €30 million bribe to Indian politicians, bureaucrats and Indian Air Force officials.&lt;ref name="ndtv.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=CBI Seeks Italian Court's Order On AgustaWestland Graft | website=NDTV.com | date=27 April 2016 | url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/cbi-seeks-italian-courts-order-on-agustawestland-graft-1399825 | accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 9 December 2016, the CBI arrested former [[Indian Air Force]] Chief [[S.P. Tyagi]] along with his cousin Sanjeev Tyagi and lawyer Gautam Khaitan.&lt;ref name="CBI arrests"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pandey|first1=Devesh K.|title=Former Air Force chief Tyagi arrested by CBI in AgustaWestland case|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/former-air-force-chief-tyagi-arrested-by-cbi-in-agustawestland-case/article16784677.ece|accessdate=25 October 2017|work=The Hindu|date=9 December 2016|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, the CBI filed a formal [[chargesheet]] against S.P. Tyagi and nine others.

On 16 December, 2016, the Italian Supreme Court of ''Cassazione'' cancelled the April 2016 conviction sentence, and ordered a retrial to be held again in Milan.

On January 8, 2018, the third Court of Appeals of Milan finally acquitted the defendants on all charges &lt;ref&gt;https://in.reuters.com/article/leonardo-india-corruption-trial/italian-court-clears-former-leonardo-bosses-in-india-corruption-case-idINKBN1EX159?il=0&lt;/ref&gt;
==Overview==
India signed a contract to purchase 12 AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters in February 2010 for the Communication Squadron of [[Indian Air Force]] to carry the president, PM and other VVIPs.  Controversy over the contract came to light on 12 February 2013 with the arrest of [[Giuseppe Orsi]], the CEO of [[Finmeccanica]], AgustaWestland's parent company by Italian authorities;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/02/12/uk-orsi-finmeccanica-idUKBRE91B09K20130212 |title=Finmeccanica head arrested over India bribe allegations |author=Emilio Parodi and Stephen Jewkes |publisher=Reuters |date=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following day Indian Defence Minister [[A.K.

On 25 February 2013, CBI registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against 11 persons including the former [[Indian Air Force]] Chief, Air Chief Marshal [[S.P.

In 2013, billionaire Indian arms dealer [[Abhishek Verma (businessman)|Abhishek Verma]] and his [[Romanian people|Romanian]] born wife [[Anca Verma|Anca Neacsu]] were named suspects in this scandal. Abhishek had played the role of a middleman in the deal and had interfaced with the politicians in securing [[Cabinet Committee on Security|CCS clearance]] from the Cabinet Committee.

In September 2015, a special CBI court issued an open non-bailable warrant (NBW) against Christian Michel based on a CBI report that he was needed to be questioned in the case to know how much amount he had received as "commission" in the deal. The CBI said that "Based on this arrest warrant, Interpol India would be requested to issue a Red Corner Notice against Christian Michel James and execute said warrant."&lt;ref name="Open NBW Issued Against Accused UK National"&gt;{{cite news|title=Open NBW Issued Against Accused UK National|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/news/article/vvip-chopper-deal-open-nbw-issued-against-accused-uk-national/914408|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview to a newspaper, he denied any wrongdoing by stating that he had never met any "Gandhi" in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VVIP chopper scam: Never met Sonia Gandhi in my life, says accused middleman|url=http://www.abplive.in/india-news/agustawestland-vvip-chopper-scam-never-met-sonia-gandhi-in-my-life-says-alleged-middleman-james-christian-michel-330233|agency=ABP News Bureau|publisher=ABP Live|date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enforcement Directorate]] (ED) is [[Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002|investigating money laundering]] allegations. In March 2015, the ED traced and identified the properties worth around {{INR}}1.12 crore owned by Christian Michel and issued a provisional attachment order. The ED claimed that Michel bought a flat in south Delhi's [[Safdarjung Enclave]] in the name of media firm Media Exim using the bribe money. He was also reportedly in possession of a luxury car and a Fixed Deposit of {{INR}}54 lakh. In September 2015, the adjudicating authority confirmed the attachment of properties and allowed the agency to retain the properties.&lt;ref name="First property attachment"&gt;{{cite news|title=First property attachment in AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal scam|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-09-02/news/66144110_1_christian-michel-adjudicating-authority-enforcement-directorate|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, the ED attached assets worth about {{INR}}7 crore alleged to be in the name of family members of ex-IAF Chief S.

== Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation ==
{{See also|Joint Parliamentary Committee}}

On 27 February 2013, [[United Progressive Alliance (India)|UPA-II Government]] introduced a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] in [[Rajya Sabha]] (the [[upper house]] of the [[Parliament of India]]) for an investigation led by a 30-member [[Joint Parliamentary Committee]] (JPC). The motion was passed after a [[walkout]] by most of the opposition parties like [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]], [[Janata Dal (United)|JD(U)]], [[All India Trinamool Congress|Trinamool Congress]], [[Communist Party of India|CPI]], [[Telugu Desam Party|TDP]] and [[Asom Gana Parishad|AGP]].&lt;ref name="Parliament passes JPC probe into chopper scam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Govt adopts motion for JPC probe, opposition walks out"&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt adopts motion for JPC probe, opposition walks out|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/chopper-deal-govt-adopts-motion-for-jpc-probe-opposition-walks-out-642296.html|accessdate=4 March 2013|newspaper=FirstPost|date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the debate, [[Leader of the Opposition (India)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Arun Jaitley]] said the JPC was an "exercise in futility" and a "diversionary tactic." He argued that the case involved various legal aspects such as [[extradition]] of accused foreigners and [[custodial interrogation]] and the JPC can have "none of these powers," leaving it ineffective. Many opposition members demanded [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court-monitored investigation]] (on the similar lines of [[2G spectrum case]]). Demands were also made to establish money trail and issue [[Letter Rogatory]] (LR).&lt;ref name="Parliament passes JPC probe into chopper scam"&gt;{{cite news |title=Parliament passes JPC probe into chopper scam |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/parliament-passes-jpc-probe-into-chopper-scam/1080660/ |publisher=Indian Express |date= 27 February 2013 |accessdate= 28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UPA government initially denied all allegations and claimed it has "nothing to hide" and that "our track record is not cover up."&lt;ref name="Parliament passes JPC probe into chopper scam"/&gt;

== Cancellation of the contract by the Indian Government ==
India cancelled the {{INR}}3,600 crore deal with [[AgustaWestland]] in January 2014. The government cancelled the contract "on grounds of breach of the Pre-contract [[Integrity pact|Integrity Pact]] and the agreement by AWIL (AgustaWestland International Ltd)". The contract was frozen in February 2013 after allegations surfaced that Rs 3,600 crore was paid as a bribe.

Their statements were considered vital as they were National Security Adviser and [[Special Protection Group]] (SPG) chief at the time of the signing of the contract with AgustaWestland. Their views were also considered before the Indian Government signed the contract with AgustaWestland. However, [[Kapil Sibal]]'s Union Law ministry stonewalled the CBI probe by rejecting CBI's request to examine them under the usual excuse of "immunity." The CBI, therefore, approached President [[Pranab Mukherjee]] to seek permission to examine ex-NSA and ex-chief of SPG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2014-01-22/india/46461322_1_service-ceiling-former-iaf-chief-cbi-move |title= VVIP chopper deal: CBI seeks President's permission to question Narayanan, Wanchoo | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; M.

==Italian Court judgements==
The Italian court, investigating the case in October 2014, acquitted ex-IAF Chief S.P.

The '''American Academy of Diplomacy''' is a private, non-profit, non-partisan, elected organization whose active membership is limited to men and women who have held positions of high responsibility in crafting and implementing American foreign policy. They have served the United States as chiefs of mission in major embassies abroad, and/or equivalent high-level foreign policy positions in Washington.

Founded in 1983, the Academy focuses the expertise of its members on the pursuit of excellence in the practice of American diplomacy.

In its early years, the Academy provided the [[U.S. Senate]] [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations Committee]] with commentary on the qualifications of those nominated by the [[President of the United States|President]] as [[ambassador]]s, but today it only does so in exceptional circumstances, such as if the Board of Directors feels strongly about a nominee's lack of qualifications to be ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academyofdiplomacy.org/about/mission-and-history/|title=The American Academy of Diplomacy - Mission|work=academyofdiplomacy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academy is financially supported by its members, and by grants from foundations and corporate contributors.

The '''Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League''' ({{lang-my|ဖက်ဆစ်ဆန့်ကျင်ရေး ပြည်သူ့လွတ်လပ်ရေး အဖွဲ့ချုပ်}}, {{IPA-my|pʰɛʔsʰɪʔ sʰa̰ɴtɕɪ̀ɴjé pjìðṵ lʊʔlaʔjé əpʰwɛ̰dʑoʊʔ|pron}}; abbreviated '''AFPFL'''), or ''hpa hsa pa la'' ({{my|ဖဆပလ}}) by its [[Burmese language|Burmese]] acronym, was the main [[political alliance]] in [[Burma]] from 1945 until 1958. It was founded by the [[Communist Party of Burma]] (CPB) led by [[Thakin Soe]], the [[Burma National Army]] (BNA) led by [[Aung San]], and the [[People's Revolutionary Party (Burma)|People's Revolutionary Party]] (PRP) (which later evolved into the [[Burma Socialist Party|Socialist Party]]) at a meeting held between 1–3 March 1945 as a reorganised version of the [[Anti-Fascist Organisation]] (AFO), formed to resist the [[Japan]]ese occupation. The new organisation aimed to resist the [[Great Britain|British]] colonial administration and achieve independence.

Following internal disputes, the party split into two factions in June 1958, the [[Union Party (Burma)|Clean AFPFL]] and the [[Stable AFPFL]].

==History==

===Fight for independence===
[[File:AFPFL headquarters.jpg|thumb|AFPFL headquarters in Rangoon.]]

The AFPFL was formed as a reorganisation of the [[Anti-Fascist Organisation]] at a meeting held from 1–3 March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Haruhiro Fukui (1985) ''Political parties of Asia and the Pacific'', Greenwood Press, pp108–109&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Aung San]] left the army to re-enter the political arena as a civilian, he became the recognised leader and president of the AFPFL in January 1946.

The AFPFL was a [[political alliance]] comprising several very different political parties held together by the common leadership of first Aung San and then [[U Nu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title=World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2007|page=626|isbn=978-0-7614-7631-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first general secretary was the communist leader [[Thakin Than Tun]].

Dissent and rifts began to appear in the AFPFL over the negotiations regarding strategy and more importantly the nature of independence on offer. Thakin Soe started a rebellion after splitting from the CPB forming a splinter group called the [[Communist Party (Burma)|Red Flag Communist Party]]. The CPB, now dubbed the White Flag Communists, continued to co-operate with the AFPFL, but Than Tun was forced to resign as general secretary in July 1946 and replaced by the socialist [[Kyaw Nyein]], after a split with Aung San and the rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=John Seabury|title=Marxism in South East Asia|editor=Trager, Frank N |publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1960|page=34|chapter=Marxism in Burma|isbn=978-0-8047-0592-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aung San became the [[de facto]] [[premier of Burma]] in September 1946 when he accepted the British Governor's invitation to lead the [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]]. The communists accused him and the others of selling out and settling for what they alleged a 'sham independence'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnstone|first=William Crane|title=Burma's foreign policy: a study in neutralism|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1963|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPB was then expelled from the AFPFL the following November. The AFPFL negotiated with the British total independence for Burma including the [[ethnic minorities]], and Aung San succeeded in uniting the majority [[Bamar|Burmans]] with the hills peoples at the [[Panglong Conference]] in February 1947. [[Aung Zan Wai]], [[Pe Khin]], [[Bo Hmu Aung]], Sir Maung Gyi, [[Myoma U Than Kywe]] and Sein Mya Maung were among the negotiators of the conference negotiated with Bamar representative Aung San and other ethnic leaders in 1947. All these leaders unanimously decided to join the [[Union of Burma]].

[[Burmese general election, 1947|General elections]] were held in April 1947, which the AFPFL won convincingly amidst an opposition boycott, taking 173 of the 210 seats and running unopposed in over fifty constituencies. Aung San was set to become [[Prime Minister of Burma|Prime Minister]], but was assassinated together with six other members of his cabinet on 19 July, a date that later became [[Burmese Martyrs' Day|Martyrs' Day]]. In his place, U Nu then became both the Premier of Burma and leader of the AFPFL.

===Independence and civil war===
Burma declared independence from Britain in January 1948, and the CPB went underground the following March after U Nu ordered the arrest of its leaders for inciting rebellion.  Other groups also soon dropped out of the AFPFL to join the rebellion, not only the White-band faction of the People's Volunteer Organisation (PVO) formed by Aung San as a [[paramilitary]] force out of the demobbed veterans, but also a large part of the [[Burma Rifles]] led by communist commanders calling themselves the Revolutionary Burma Army (RBA). The AFPFL government had plunged into [[civil war]] with not only [[Bamar|Burman]] insurgent groups but also [[ethnic minorities]] including the [[Karen National Union]] (KNU), [[Mon people|Mon]], [[Pa-O]], nationalist [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] and the [[Mujahid]] or [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]] [[Muslims]].

The first post-independence [[Burmese general election, 1951–52|general elections]] were held over several months in 1951 and 1952, with the AFPFL and its allies winning 199 of the 250 seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Burma)|Chamber of Deputies]].

===Parliamentary rule and split===
Although the AFPFL was returned to office again in the [[Burmese general election, 1956|1956 elections]], the results came as a shock as the opposition left-wing coalition, known as the [[National United Front]] (NUF) and led by Aung Than, older brother of Aung San, won 37% of the vote and 48 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

By 1958, despite an economic recovery and the unexpected success of U Nu's 'Arms for Democracy' offer that saw the surrender of a large number of insurgents most notably the PVO, the AFPFL had become riven with internal splits, which worsened following the party's congress in January 1958. In July 1958 it formally split, with one group led by Prime Minister [[U Nu]], which he named the "[[Union Party (Burma)|Clean AFPFL]]"; the other was led by [[Kyaw Nyein]] and [[Ba Swe]] and was known as the [[Stable AFPFL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Article/Article2005/April05/April03.htm |title=Tatmadaw’s future role history has bequeathed |date=3 April 1995 |publisher=[[New Light of Myanmar]] |accessdate=5 November 2009 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of AFPFL MPs were supporters of the Stable faction, but U Nu was able to narrowly escape defeat in parliamentary [[motion of no-confidence]] by only eight votes with the support of the opposition NUF. Still dogged by the 'multicoloured insurgency', the army hardliners feared the communists being allowed to rejoin mainstream politics through Nu's need for continued support by the NUF, and was compounded by the [[Shan people|Shan]] [[federalism|Federal Movement]] lobbying for a loose federation. The volatile situation culminated in a military [[caretaker government]] under General [[Ne Win]] that presided over the [[Burmese general election, 1960|1960 general elections]], which were won by U Nu's Clean AFPFL.

Following the restoration of multi-party democracy after the [[8888 Uprising]], two new parties were established using the AFPFL name, the AFPFL (founded 1988)&lt;ref&gt;''The Far East and Australasia 2003'', p892&lt;/ref&gt; and the AFPFL (Original). Both contested the [[Myanma general election, 1990|1990 elections]], but received less than 0.05% of the vote and failed to win a seat.

==Policies==
During its time in office, the AFPFL pursued a [[nationalism|nationalist]] policy based on unity and consensus, upheld [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and presided over a [[mixed economy]] comprising both [[state enterprise|state]] and [[private enterprise]]. It spent most of this period in its history fighting several communist, socialist and ethnic separatist rebel groups for control over the future of the country. It also fought a successful war against [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Chinese]] (KMT) forces who occupied the far north of the country for several years after the KMT's defeat by the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. Its foreign policy followed strict [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] supporting the [[Bandung Conference]] of 1955,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fleischmann|first=Klaus|title=Documents on communism in Burma, 1945-1977|publisher=Institut für Asienkunde|year=1989|page=244|isbn=978-3-88910-057-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; shunning the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation ([[SEATO]]) on account of the [[United States of America|American]] support of the KMT on one hand, and facing the communist insurgencies on the other.

'''''Balance of Power''''' is a [[computer strategy game]] of [[geopolitics]] during the [[Cold War]], created by [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]] and published in 1985 on the [[Apple Macintosh]] by [[Mindscape]], followed by ports to a variety of platforms over the next two years.

In the game the player takes the role of the President of the [[United States]] or General Secretary of the [[Soviet Union]]. The goal is to improve the player's country's standing in the world relative to the other [[superpower]]. During each yearly turn, random events occur that may have effects on the player's international prestige. The player can choose to respond to these events in various ways, which may prompt a response from the other superpower. This creates [[brinkmanship]] situations between the two nations, potentially escalating to a [[nuclear war]], which ends the game.

Crawford was already fairly well known for earlier games, especially ''[[Eastern Front (1941)]]''. His 1984 announcement that he was moving to the Macintosh platform to work on an entirely new idea in gaming generated considerable interest. It was widely reviewed after its release, including an extremely positive review in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''. It was praised for its inventive nonaction gameplay that was nevertheless exciting and a distinct alternative to the more common [[arcade game]]s of the era. It has been named as one of the most innovative computer games of all time.

Hugely successful on the Mac, the addition of an [[IBM PC]] port late in the year made it a best seller. Ultimately selling over a quarter million units although it only ran on relatively new platforms, it represented a not-insignificant fraction of all video game sales through 1985 and 86. It spawned a number of sequels and copycats, but none of these were as successful as the original.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:BalanceOfPower.png|thumb|left|Screenshot from the [[Atari ST]] version]]

The player may choose to be either the [[President of the United States|President]] of the [[United States]] or the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] of the [[Soviet Union]], and must lead the chosen [[superpower]] for eight years, seeking to maximize "prestige" and avoiding a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Each turn is one year long; at the beginning of each year, the player is presented with a set of incidents and crises in various countries around the globe, and must choose a response to each one. Responses may range from no action, to diplomatic notes to the other superpower, to military maneuvers. Each response is then met with a counter-response, which may vary from backing down to escalation. The player then gets a chance to initiate actions, and deal with the opponent's responses.

This core mechanic is similar to that of Bruce Ketchledge's 1983 game ''Geopolitique 1990'', published by [[Strategic Simulations, Inc.|SSI]]. One difference from the earlier game is how negotiations are resolved. In both games, backing down in a negotiation results in a loss of prestige, which will reverberate politically. Likewise, in both games brinkmanship may result in a global war. In ''Geopolitique'', such wars were actually fought in-game, after which the game continued. In ''Balance of Power'', such a war ends the game instantly, with the following message: "You have ignited a(n accidental) nuclear war. And no, there is no animated display of a mushroom cloud with parts of bodies flying through the air. We do not reward failure."

==Development==
Crawford had made a name for himself during his years at [[Atari]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His smash hit ''Eastern Front'' made him one of the few game authors known by name, and helped ensure later releases were also successful to a degree. By early 1984, Atari was rapidly going bankrupt due to the effects of the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. In March they laid off the majority of their staff, including Crawford. His ample severance was enough to allow him to write a new game as a freelancer. After considering a sequel to ''Eastern Front'' or a political game about the [[Inca]] empire, he eventually decided to write a cold war "game about peace".{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=282}} Crawford cited [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" as an emotional inspiration to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Game Design Theory &amp; Practice|version=Second Edition|publisher=Wordware Publishing, Inc.|last=Rouse III|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Rouse III|year=2005|isbn=1-55622-912-7|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the Atari platform a lost cause, Crawford began looking at the new [[16-bit]] platforms that were just coming to market; he dismissed the [[IBM PC]] as too crude, the [[Commodore Amiga|Amiga]] as likely to fail for business reasons, and chose the Macintosh as the platform to develop on. At the time this was non-trivial, as there were no development tools for the Mac, and programmers had to buy an [[Apple Lisa]] for this.{{sfn|Craawford|2003|p=282}}

During an April 1984 interview at the [[Origins Game Fair]], Crawford stated that he was "working on a game for the Macintosh entitled ARMS RACE based on the philosophy that 'H-bombs don't kill people, geopolitics kills people.'"&lt;ref name="cgw198410"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=The CGW Computer Game Conference | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | date=October 1984 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1984&amp;pub=2&amp;id=18 | accessdate=October 31, 2013 | page=30 | type=panel discussion}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=285}} By May the initial concept was fleshed out; the game would take place on top of a world map that could show various details,{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=286}} events would be presented as newspaper stories following an algorithmic concept he developed after considering the headlines in ''[[National Enquirer]]'',{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=287}} and these events and their outcomes would be expressed in terms of "prestige points".

Crawford had difficulty in finding a publisher for ''Balance of Power'', due in no small part to the lingering effects of the 1983 crash. [[Random House]] eventually agreed to publish it, but there was considerable ill will between Crawford and the editor assigned to him, who had no prior experience with video games. Random House ultimately cancelled the contract and demanded that Crawford return its $10,000 [[advance payment]], almost causing him to lose his home.&lt;ref name="cgw198702"&gt;{{cite news | title=Designer Profile: Chris Crawford (Part 2) | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1987&amp;pub=2&amp;id=34 | work=Computer Gaming World | date=Jan–Feb 1987 | accessdate=1 November 2013 | pages=56–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife demanded he get a "real job".{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=296}}

The work was saved by a friend at ''[[InfoWorld]]'', who heard of his troubles and published a two-part column on the game. The article was seen by a producer at the newly formed [[Mindscape Group|Mindscape]], who agreed to publish it. Betas were ready in February 1985, and were polished through the spring and summer. The game was released in September, and was an immediate sensation given that the world was then at the height of the Cold War. The fame was in no small part helped by a review in ''The New York Times Magazine'' written by [[David L. Aaron]], [[Jimmy Carter]]'s Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, who called it "about as close as one might get to the cut-and-thrust of international politics without going through confirmation by the Senate."&lt;ref name="aarons19851229"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Aaron |first=David |date=1985-12-29 |title=Playing with Apocalypse |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/29/magazine/playing-with-apocalypse.html?pagewanted=all |magazine=The New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=297}}

The game was an immediate hit on the initial Macintosh and [[Apple II]] platforms. A release for [[Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows 1.0]] in 1986 made it a multiplatform best seller. These were followed by versions on the [[Atari ST]] (1987) and [[Amiga]], among others. In total, the game sold over $10 million during its heyday, during a time when total sales for all gaming hardware and software combined was about $500 million.{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=297}}

In 1986, Crawford published a book also called ''Balance of Power'', which goes into great depth on the game, including the background of the politics, the formulas used to calculate prestige and related parameters, and an account of its (lengthy) gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Balance of Power the Book |url=http://www.erasmatazz.com/library/my-books/balance-of-power-the-book/index.html |date= 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2013 Crawford released [[source code]] of several of his games, among them ''Balance of Power'', from his career to the public, fulfilling a 2011 given promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmatazz.com/library/source-code/index.html| title=Source Code|quote=30 months ago, at the 2011 Game Developers Conference, somebody asked me to release the source code for my old games. I said I would look into it. [...] I have begun the process of preparing my source code for general distribution. |accessdate=2017-02-24 |year=2013 |first=Chris |last=Crawford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that ''Balance of Power'' "stands in a prestigious circle: that of the most innovative computer games of all time. If there were Academy Awards for computer games, BOP would get my votes for Best Picture and Best Director of 1985".&lt;ref name="boosman198605"&gt;{{cite news | title=Macintosh Window | work=Computer Gaming World |date = May 1986| accessdate=November 1, 2013 | author=Boosman, Frank C. | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1986&amp;pub=2&amp;id=29 | pages=18, 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1992 survey in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game four stars out of five,&lt;ref name="brooks199206"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=95 | title=The Modern Games: 1950 - 2000 | work=Computer Gaming World |date = June 1992| accessdate=November 24, 2013 | author=Brooks, M.

This is a marvelous program that everyone should experience at least once."&lt;ref name="Dragon116"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers|author=Lesser, Hartley and Pattie|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|issue=116|date=December 1986|pages=69–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[BYTE]]'' praised the game in 1986, describing the Mac version as "the best game I had ever seen on any computer ... by all means, get the program".&lt;ref name="shapiro198612"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-12/1986_12_BYTE_11-13_Graphics_Algorithms#page/n335/mode/2up | title=Stocking Stuffers | work=BYTE |date = December 1986| accessdate=9 May 2015 | author=Shapiro, Ezra | pages=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Info (magazine)|Info]]'' gave the Amiga version four-plus stars out of five, approving of the complex gameplay with a good user interface. While complaining of the lack of sound from the "[[video game porting|obvious Macintosh influence]]", the magazine concluded that it was "An excellent game".&lt;ref name="info198701amiga"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Dunnington |first=Benn |last2=Brown |first2=Mark R. |last3=Malcolm |first3=Tom |date=January–February 1987 |title=Amiga Gallery |url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-13/Info_Issue_13_1987_Jan-Feb#page/n89/mode/2up |magazine=Info |pages=90–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Compute!]]'' presented opposing views of the game in May 1988. The magazine included ''Balance of Power'' in its list of "Our Favorite Games", calling it "an impressive recreation of the world's geopolitical landscape ... call one too many bluffs and you'll see the chilling message ''You have ignited a nuclear war''".&lt;ref name="compute198805"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-05-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_096_1988_May#page/n13/mode/2up | title=Our Favorite Games | work=Compute! |date = May 1988| accessdate=November 10, 2013 | pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orson Scott Card]], however, wrote in his review of the game that Crawford—"the best designer of simulation games I've seen"—was "leaning over your shoulder and bullying you into playing the game his way. He has a sweet delusion that as long as the United States is very nice and doesn't do anything to offend them, the Russians will go home. And if you don't play that way, why, he'll stop the game with a nasty remark about how the world was just destroyed by nuclear war". He added that since no nuclear war had been fought Crawford could not know what would cause one, and "there are a lot of experts who claim that the Soviets seem to behave a lot nicer when we stand up to them than when we disarm", but that "[Crawford] is so sure he's right that ''Balance of Power'' isn't a game, it's propaganda".&lt;ref name="card198805"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-05-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_096_1988_May#page/n9/mode/2up | title=Do You Want to Change the World? Two Games Let You Try | work=Compute! |date = May 1988| accessdate=November 10, 2013 | author=Card, Orson Scott | pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 ''Compute!'' stated that the 1990 edition's multipolar features were welcome additions to the game.&lt;ref name="keizer198901"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-01-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_104_1989_Jan#page/n81/mode/2up | title=Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition | work=Compute! |date = January 1989| accessdate=November 10, 2013 | author=Keizer, Gregg | pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year Card stated that the magazine's 1988 list caused him to reevaluate the game when playing the 1990 edition, stating that it had "the most detailed, carefully extrapolated future world I've worked with". While still criticizing geopolitical "absurdities" such as forcing the United States to passively accept Soviet troops in Syria (contrary to what happened during the [[Yom Kippur War]]) and advisors in Mexico or start nuclear war, Card now concluded that such outcomes probably reflected computer limitations rather than Crawford's political views. He advised players to pretend that ''Balance of Power'' was set on an alien planet "astonishingly similar" to Earth, and to play solely based on the game's assumptions about the world.&lt;ref name="card198906"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-06-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_109_1989_Jun#page/n29/mode/2up | title=Light-years and Lasers / Science Fiction Inside Your Computer | work=Compute! |date = June 1989| accessdate=November 11, 2013 | author=Card, Orson Scott | pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chuck Moss]] disagreed with Card's revised view, describing ''Balance of Power'' in ''Computer Gaming World'' in 1992 as "reflect[ing] extreme bias on the part of [its] designers". He called it a "pacific treatise ... nuclear war erupted if the U.S. so much as sent five million dollars to Panama".&lt;ref name="moss199211"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=100 | title=Spectrum Holobyte's Crisis in the Kremlin | work=Computer Gaming World |date = November 1992| accessdate=4 July 2014 | author=Moss, Chuck | pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford stated in 1987 that he was most proud of his work on the game: "I feel [it] has made the world a better place ... I think it has made a small number of people much more realistic in their appraisal of world affairs".{{r|cgw198702}} In 1996 ''Computer Gaming World'' ranked it as the 78th best game of all time, calling it "a wonderful  game of political intrigue that felt just like the Cold War and didn't require the detail of ''[[Shadow President]]'' or ''[[CyberJudas]]''."&lt;ref name="cgw199611best"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1996&amp;pub=2&amp;id=148 | title=150 Best Games of All Time | work=Computer Gaming World |date = November 1996| accessdate=25 March 2016 | pages=64–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year it was ranked as the 75th top game of all time by ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'', who commented "Although the game's premises are hopelessly outdated (U.S.S.R.? What's that?) and some disagree with the politics, the AI in ''Balance of Power'', combined with its unique play style, make it a classic."&lt;ref&gt;''Next Generation'' 21 (September 1996), p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, ''[[The Guardian]]'' listed it first on its list of "The 10 political games everyone should play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2006/oct/26/tenseriousgam |title=The 10 political games everyone should play |first=Keith |last=Stuart |website=The Guardian |date=26 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels==
After ''Balance of Power'', Crawford began work on an entirely new game, ''[[Trust &amp; Betrayal: The Legacy of Siboot]]'', released in 1987 and selling only a few thousand copies. Mindscape was disappointed, and pressured Crawford to do a follow-up to ''Balance of Power''. The company pressed him hard on it, and Crawford felt that he "owed them one" after publishing ''Siboot''. This sequel was released in 1989 as '''''Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition''''' (sometimes referred to as ''Balance of Power II'') on the [[Apple IIGS]], Windows, Macintosh, Amiga and Atari ST. The [[video game industry]] sees it as a "major new version", but Crawford doesn't consider it a proper sequel, saying he was simply "tidying up, adding some bells and whistles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Rouse III |title= Game Design: Theory and Practice, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=-YhFl6iAGw4C |pages=168–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition'' adds more countries, advisors to help the player, a new "multi-polar" level that allows countries to generate events of their own (such as declaring war on other countries), and a few miscellaneous features including a 2 player [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|Hotseat]] mode. However, with the ending of the Cold War, interest in the sequel had declined.

In 1992 Crawford gave the "Dragon Speech" where he explained that he was going to leave the game industry to make something more interactive and artistic. After many false starts, this emerged initially as ''The Erasmatron'', and later re-released under the name ''Storytron''. Both systems were used to make highly complex interactive storylines, and as a demo, Crawford used Storytron to build a new game, ''Balance of Power: 21st Century''. This version begins on 12 September 2001 and mostly involves the US's interactions with Asia and other emerging powers. It was not a success; Crawford himself describes it as "crap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Crawford |url=http://www.storytron.com/WhatWentWrong.html |title=Storytron: What Went Wrong |website=Storytron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Balance of Power'' has also been use as the basis for a number of [[play by mail]] versions, manually run and based on moves posted in [[internet forum]] systems. One long running example is hosted on eRegime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eregime.org/index.php? |website=www.eregime.org/index/ |title=Balance of Power XV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It protested the [[Communications Decency Act]] (CDA), a piece of [[Rider (legislation)|"rider" legislation]] for [[Internet censorship]] attached to the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], and passed by the [[United States Congress]] on February 1, 1996. Timed to coincide with President [[Bill Clinton]]'s signing of the bill on February 8, 1996, a large number of web sites had their background color turned to black for 48 hours to protest the CDA's curtailment of [[freedom of expression]]. Thousands of websites, including a number of major ones, joined in the protest. The campaign was noted by major media such as the [[CNN]], [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Collings&gt;{{cite news|last=Collings|first=Anthony|title=Home pages to go black in protest|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9602/cyber_censors/index.html|accessdate=20 November 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=February 9, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Peter H.|title=Protest, Cyberspace-Style, for New Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/08/us/protest-cyberspace-style-for-new-law.html|accessdate=20 November 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 8, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The legislation which gave rise to the protest threatened fines or imprisonment for those accused of distributing "indecent" or "patently offensive" materials without providing some way of blocking access to minors.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Harry|title=Library in a book : power of the news media|year=2004|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York|isbn=9780816047680}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the bill compared this to demanding librarians assess the age of library users before allowing them access to a particular book in the collection.&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Andrew D.|title=The regulation of cyberspace : control in the online environment|year=2006|publisher=Routledge-Cavendish|location=Milton Park, Abingdon, UK|isbn=9781904385219|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Communications Decency Act was stuck down as [[unconstitutional]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in a 9-0 vote on June 26, 1997, upholding an earlier [[United States federal district court|federal district court]] ruling. The majority of [[United States Supreme Court Justice|Justices]] found the CDA violated adults' [[First Amendment]] free speech rights with its [[Overbreadth doctrine|overbroad]] suppression and [[Vagueness doctrine|vague]] language, despite any legitimate interest of the government in protecting children from "harmful materials". A concurring minority opinion, penned by Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] and Chief Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]], argued that the law might have been constitutional if limited to situations concerning an intent and knowledge to provide indecent materials to children.&lt;ref name=Flagg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flagg|first=Gordon|title=Supreme Court strikes down Communications Decency Act|journal=American Libraries|date=May 1997|volume=28|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6689">'''Campaign to Defend the Constitution''' ('''DefCon''') was an American online organization founded in September 2005 to support the [[separation of church and state]] and to oppose what it perceived as the growing influence of the [[Christian right|religious right]]. It was a project of the [[Tides Center]], a non-profit organization that funds [[Progressivism|progressive]] groups.  However, its funding ran out in December 2007, at which time its blog announced the organization was "taking a break."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defconblog.org/2007/11/taking-a-break/ |title=DefConBlog final entry "Taking a break" |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723174525/http://defconblog.org/2007/11/taking-a-break/] |date=2007-11-20 |archivedate=August 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns ==

=== Left Behind: Eternal Forces Campaign ===
After Bible publishing company [[Tyndale House]] released the video game version of [[Tim LaHaye|Tim LaHaye's]]'s ''[[Left Behind (series)|Left Behind]]'' called ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]'', DefCon asked their members to send emails to [[Wal-Mart]] CEO [[Lee Scott (businessman)|Lee Scott]] to stop selling the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Stem cell research ===

During the stem cell campaign, DefCon ran two full page ads in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in [https://web.archive.org/web/20070203141109/http://www.defconamerica.org/images/downloadables/nyt_stemcell.pdf May] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20061120130443/http://www.defconamerica.org/stemcell/DefconNYTimesStemCell.pdf June].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Intelligent design ===

DefCon was launched during the [[Intelligent design|Dover Intelligent Design trial]] in September, 2005. Since that time the group and its members have played a "key role defending science education" in states around the country including Kansas, Utah, and Ohio.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Criticism==
DefCon ran ads asserting the involvement of conservative political strategist [[Ralph E. Reed, Jr.|Ralph Reed]], evangelist [[Lou Sheldon]], and [[Focus on the Family]]'s [[James Dobson]] in the [[Jack Abramoff]] lobbying scandal.  Dobson has denied any connection to Abramoff, and a DefCon spokesman has conceded that there was no proof of collusion between Dobson and Abramoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/article379.htmll |title=Guilt by Association |publisher=FactCheck.org |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2006-12-15 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the ads, Dobson characterized DefCon as "a radical leftist organization," and stated:

{{quote|Despite the viciousness of the DefCon attack, we are not vengeful or vindictive about it. Nor are we discouraged or depressed. It goes with the territory. Everyone who tries to defend righteousness in the culture is treated to something similar. Jesus told His followers to expect persecution, and therefore, it comes as no surprise that we have been subjected to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Contains Khmer text}}
The '''Communist Party of Kampuchea''' ({{lang-km|បក្សកុម្មុយនីស្តកម្ពុជា}} or {{lang|km|បក្សកុម្មុយនីសកម្ពុជា}}; CPK), also known as '''Khmer Communist Party''' (KCP),&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/frd/cs/cambodia/kh_appnb.html "Cambodia and the Khmer People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP), Appendix B - Major Political and Military Organizations"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928150646/http://www.country-data.com/frd/cs/cambodia/kh_appnb.html |date=2009-09-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[communist party]] in [[Cambodia]]. Its leader was [[Pol Pot]] and its followers were generally known as [[Khmer Rouge]] (Red Khmers). The party was underground for most of its existence and took power in the country in 1975 and established the state known as [[Democratic Kampuchea]]. The party lost power in 1979 with the establishment of the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] by leftists who were dissatisfied by the Pol Pot regime and by the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|intervention of Vietnamese military forces]] after a [[Cambodian genocide|period of mass killing]]. The party was officially dissolved in 1981, with the [[Party of Democratic Kampuchea]] claiming its legacy.

== History ==
=== Foundation of the party and first divisions ===
The party was founded in 1951, when the [[Indochinese Communist Party]] (ICP) was divided into separate Cambodian, [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party|Lao]] and [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnamese]] communist parties. The decision to form a separate Cambodian communist party had been taken at the ICP congress in February the same year. Different sources claim different dates for the exact founding and the first congress of the party. [[Son Ngoc Minh]] was appointed as Acting Chairman of the party. The party congress did not elect a full [[Central Committee]], but instead appointed a Party Propagation and Formation Committee.&lt;ref name="frings"&gt;Frings, K. Viviane, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/312846 Rewriting Cambodian History to 'Adapt' It to a New Political Context: The Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party's Historiography (1979-1991)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830110158/https://www.jstor.org/stable/312846 |date=2018-08-30 }}'' in Modern Asian Studies, Vol. 31, No. 4. (October 1997), pp. 807-846.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its formation, the Cambodian party was called [[Khmer People's Revolutionary Party]] (KPRP). The ICP had been heavily dominated by Vietnamese and the KPRP was actively supported by the Vietnamese party during its initial phase of existence. Due to the reliance on Vietnamese support in the joint struggle against French colonial rule, the history of the party would later be rewritten, stating 1960 as the year of foundation of the party.&lt;ref name="chandler"&gt;Chandler, David P., ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2758655 Revising the Past in Democratic Kampuchea: When Was the Birthday of the Party?: Notes and Comments] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830110226/https://www.jstor.org/stable/2758655 |date=2018-08-30 }}'', in [[Pacific Affairs]], Vol. 56, No. 2 (Summer 1983), pp. 288-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Democratic Kampuchea's version of party history, the [[Viet Minh]]'s failure to negotiate a political role for the KPRP at the 1954 Geneva Conference represented a betrayal of the Cambodian movement, which still controlled large areas of the countryside and which commanded at least 5,000 armed men. Following the conference, about 1,000 members of the KPRP, including Son Ngoc Minh, made a Long March into [[North Vietnam]], where they remained in exile. In late 1954, those who stayed in Cambodia founded a legal political party, the [[Pracheachon|Krom Pracheachon]], which participated in the 1955 and the 1958 National Assembly elections. In the September 1955 election, it won about 4% of the vote, but did not secure a seat in the legislature. Members of the Pracheachon were subject to constant harassment and to arrests because the party remained outside Sihanouk's [[Sangkum]]. Government attacks prevented it from participating in the 1962 election and drove it underground. It is speculated that the decision of Pracheachon to file candidates for the election had not been approved by the now renamed [[Workers Party of Kampuchea]] (WPK).&lt;ref name="chandler"/&gt; Sihanouk habitually labeled local leftists the Khmer Rouge, a term that later came to signify the party and the state headed by [[Pol Pot]], [[Nuon Chea]], [[Ieng Sary]], [[Khieu Samphan]] and their associates.

During the mid-1950s, two KPRP factions, the "urban committee" (headed by [[Tou Samouth]]) and the "rural committee" (headed by [[Sieu Heng]]), emerged. In very general terms, these groups espoused divergent revolutionary lines. The prevalent "urban" line endorsed by [[North Vietnam]] recognized that Sihanouk by virtue of his success in winning independence from the French was a genuine national leader whose neutralism and deep distrust of the United States made him a valuable asset in Hanoi's struggle to "liberate" [[South Vietnam]]. Champions of this line hoped that the prince could be persuaded to distance himself from the right-wing and to adopt leftist policies. The other line, supported for the most part by rural cadres who were familiar with the harsh realities of the countryside, advocated an immediate struggle to overthrow the "[[feudalist]]" Sihanouk. In 1959, Sieu Heng defected to the government and provided the security forces with information that enabled them to destroy as much as 90% of the party's rural apparatus. Although communist networks in Phnom Penh and in other towns under Tou Samouth's jurisdiction fared better, only a few hundred communists remained active in the country by 1960.

=== Paris students' group ===
During the 1950s, Khmer students in [[Paris]] organized their own communist movement which had little, if any, connection to the hard-pressed party in their homeland. From their ranks came the men and women who returned home and took command of the party apparatus during the 1960s, led an effective insurgency against Sihanouk and [[Lon Nol]] from 1968 until 1975 and established the regime of Democratic Kampuchea.

Pol Pot, who rose to the leadership of the communist movement in the 1960s, was born in 1928 (some sources say in 1925) in [[Kampong Thum Province]], northeast of Phnom Penh. He attended a technical high school in the capital and then went to Paris in 1949 to study radio electronics (other sources say he attended a school for printers and typesetters and also studied civil engineering).

Another member of the Paris student group was [[Ieng Sary]]. He was a [[Chinese Cambodian|Chinese-Khmer]] born in 1930 in South Vietnam. He attended the elite [[Lycée Sisowath]] in Phnom Penh before beginning courses in commerce and politics at the [[Paris Institute of Political Studies]] (more widely known as Sciences Po) in France. Khieu Samphan, considered "one of the most brilliant intellects of his generation", was born in 1931 and specialized in economics and politics during his time in Paris. In talent, he was rivaled by Hou Yuon (born in 1930), who studied economics and law. Son Sen (born in 1930) studied education and literature while Hu Nim (born in 1932) studied law.

Most members of the Paris student group came from landowner or civil servant families. Three of the Paris group forged a bond that survived years of revolutionary struggle and intraparty strife, Pol Pot and Ieng Sary married [[Khieu Ponnary]] and Khieu Thirith (also known as [[Ieng Thirith]]), purportedly relatives of Khieu Samphan. These two well-educated women also played a central role in the regime of Democratic Kampuchea.

At some time between 1949 and 1951, Pol Pot and Ieng Sary joined the [[French Communist Party]]. In 1951, the two men went to [[East Berlin]] to participate in a [[3rd World Festival of Youth and Students|youth festival]]. This experience is considered to have been a turning point in their ideological development. Meeting with Khmers who were fighting with the Viet Minh (and whom they subsequently judged to be too subservient to the Vietnamese), they became convinced that only a tightly disciplined party organization and a readiness for armed struggle could achieve revolution. They transformed the [[Khmer Students' Association]] (KSA),&lt;!--- What was the French name of the group? ---&gt; to which most of the 200 or so Khmer students in Paris belonged, into an organization for nationalist and leftist ideas. Inside the KSA and its successor organizations was a secret organization known as the Cercle Marxiste. The organization was composed of cells of three to six members with most members knowing nothing about the overall structure of the organization. In 1952, Pol Pot, Hou Yuon, Ieng Sary and other leftists gained notoriety by sending an open letter to Sihanouk calling him the "strangler of infant democracy". A year later, the French authorities closed down the KSA, but Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan helped to establish in 1956 a new group, the [[Khmer Students' Union]]. Inside, the group was still run by the Cercle Marxiste.

The doctoral dissertations written by Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan express basic themes that were later to become the cornerstones of the policy adopted by Democratic Kampuchea. The central role of the peasants in national development was espoused by Hou Yuon in his 1955 thesis, ''The Cambodian Peasants and Their Prospects for Modernization'', which challenged the conventional view that urbanization and industrialization are necessary precursors of development. The major argument in Khieu Samphan's 1959 thesis, ''Cambodia's Economy and Industrial Development'', was that the country had to become self-reliant and end its economic dependency on the developed world. In its general contours, Khieu's work reflected the influence of a branch of the "[[dependency theory]]" school, which blamed lack of development in the [[Third World]] on the economic domination of the industrialized nations.

=== Clandestine existence in Phnom Penh ===
After returning to Cambodia in 1953, Pol Pot threw himself into party work. At first, he went to join with forces allied to the Viet Minh operating in the rural areas of [[Kampong Cham Province]] (Kompong Cham). After the end of the war, he moved to Phnom Penh under Tou Samouth's "urban committee", where he became an important point of contact between above-ground parties of the left and the underground secret communist movement. His comrades Ieng Sary and Hou Yuon became teachers at a new private high school, the Lycée Kambuboth, which Hou Yuon helped to establish. Khieu Samphan returned from Paris in 1959, taught as a member of the law faculty of the University of Phnom Penh and started a left-wing French-language publication, ''[[L'Observateur]]''. The paper soon acquired a reputation in Phnom Penh's small academic circle. The following year, the government closed the paper and Sihanouk's police publicly humiliated Khieu by beating, undressing and photographing him in public—as Shawcross notes, "not the sort of humiliation that men forgive or forget". Yet the experience did not prevent Khieu from advocating cooperation with Sihanouk in order to promote a united front against United States activities in South Vietnam. As mentioned, Khieu Samphan, Hou Yuon and Hu Nim were forced to "work through the system" by joining the Sangkum and by accepting posts in the prince's government.

On 28–30 September 1960, twenty-one leaders of the KPRP held a secret congress in a vacant room of the Phnom Penh railroad station. It is estimated that 14 delegates represented the 'rural' faction and seven the 'urban' faction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://khmercanada.site.voila.fr/cambodge60.htm |title=Chronologie du Cambodge de 1960 à 1990&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422174200/http://khmercanada.site.voila.fr/cambodge60.htm |archive-date=2007-04-22 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pivotal event remains shrouded in mystery because its outcome has become an object of contention (and considerable historical rewriting) between pro-Vietnamese and anti-Vietnamese Khmer communist factions. At the meeting, the party was renamed as the Workers Party of Kampuchea. The question of cooperation with, or resistance to, Sihanouk was thoroughly discussed. A new party structure was adopted and for the first time a permanent [[Central Committee]] was appointed with Tou Samouth (who advocated a policy of cooperation) as the general secretary of the party. His ally [[Nuon Chea]], also known as Long Reth, became deputy general secretary while Pol Pot and Ieng Sary were named to the Central Committee to occupy the third and the fifth highest positions in the party hierarchy. Another committee member was veteran communist [[Keo Meas]]. In Democratic Kampuchea, this meeting would later be projected as the founding date of the party, consciously downplaying the history of the party prior to Pol Pot's ascent to leadership.&lt;ref name="chandler"/&gt;

On 20 July 1962, Tou Samouth was murdered by the Cambodian government. At the WPK's second congress in February 1963, Pol Pot was chosen to succeed Tou Samouth as the party's general secretary. Tou's allies Nuon Chea and [[Keo Meas]] were removed from the Central Committee and replaced by [[Son Sen]] and [[Vorn Vet]]. From then on, Pol Pot and loyal comrades from his Paris student days controlled the party center, edging out older veterans whom they considered excessively pro-Vietnamese.

=== Insurgency in rural Cambodia ===
In July 1963, Pol Pot and most of the central committee left Phnom Penh to establish an insurgent base in [[Ratanakiri]] Province in the northeast. Pol Pot had shortly before been put on a list of thirty-four leftists who were summoned by Sihanouk to join the government and sign statements saying Sihanouk was the only possible leader for the country. Pol Pot and Chou Chet were the only people on the list who escaped. All the others agreed to cooperate with the government and were afterward under 24-hour watch by the police.

In the mid-1960s, the [[United States Department of State]] estimated the party membership to be approximately 100.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H.. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1953329 Communism and Economic Development] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202132648/http://www.jstor.org/stable/1953329 |date=2017-02-02 }}'', in The [[American Political Science Review]], Vol. 62, No. 1. (March 1968), pp. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The region Pol Pot and the others moved to was inhabited by tribal minorities, the [[Khmer Loeu]], whose rough treatment (including resettlement and [[forced assimilation]]) at the hands of the central government made them willing recruits for a guerrilla struggle. In 1965, Pol Pot made a visit of several months to North Vietnam and China. He probably received some training in China, which must have enhanced his prestige when he returned to the WPK's liberated areas. Despite friendly relations between Sihanouk and the Chinese, the latter kept Pol Pot's visit a secret from Sihanouk. In 1971, the party changed its name to the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK).&lt;ref&gt;The party statutes, published in mid-1970s, claims that the name change was approved by the party congress in 1971. [http://www.yale.edu/cgp/iengsary.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713061652/http://www.yale.edu/cgp/iengsary.htm |date=2007-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in the name of the party was a closely guarded secret. Lower ranking members of the party and even the Vietnamese were not told of it and neither was the membership until many years later.  The party leadership endorsed armed struggle against the government, then led by [[Prince]] [[Norodom Sihanouk]]. In 1967, several small-scale attempts at insurgency were made by the CPK but they met with little success.

In 1968, the Khmer Rouge launched a national insurgency across Cambodia. Though North Vietnam had not been informed of the decision, its forces provided shelter and weapons to the Khmer Rouge after the insurgency started. The guerrilla forces of the party were baptized as the [[Kampuchean Revolutionary Army]]. Vietnamese support for the insurgency made it impossible for the ineffective and poorly motivated [[Royal Cambodian Army]] to effectively counter it.

=== Rise to power ===
The political appeal of the Khmer Rouge was increased as a result of the situation created by the [[Cambodian coup of 1970|removal of Sihanouk as head of state in 1970]]. Premier [[Lon Nol]], with the support of the National Assembly, deposed Sihanouk. Sihanouk, in exile in [[Beijing]], made an alliance with the Kampuchean Communist Party and became the nominal head of a Khmer Rouge-dominated government-in-exile (known by its French acronym [[GRUNK]]) backed by the [[People's Republic of China]]. Sihanouk's popular support in rural Cambodia allowed the Khmer Rouge to extend its power and influence to the point that by 1973 it exercised ''de facto'' control over the majority of Cambodian territory, although only a minority of its population.

The relationship between the massive carpet bombing of Cambodia by the United States and the growth of the Khmer Rouge in terms of recruitment and popular support has been a matter of interest to historians. Some historians have cited the United States intervention and bombing campaign (spanning 1965–1973) as a significant factor leading to increased support of the Khmer Rouge among the Cambodian peasantry. However, Pol Pot biographer David Chandler argues that the bombing "had the effect the Americans wanted – it broke the Communist encirclement of Phnom Penh".&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, David 2000, ''Brother Number One: A Political Biography of Pol Pot'', Revised Edition, Chiang Mai, Thailand: Silkworm Books, pp. 96-7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Rodman]] and [[Michael Lind]] claimed that the United States intervention saved Cambodia from collapse in 1970 and 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Rodman, Peter, [https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/returning-to-cambodia/ Returning to Cambodia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830041413/https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/returning-to-cambodia/ |date=2018-08-30 }}, Brookings Institution, 23 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lind, Michael, ''Vietnam: The Necessary War: A Reinterpretation of America's Most Disastrous Military Conflict'', Free Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Etcheson agreed that it was "untenable" to assert that United States intervention caused the Khmer Rouge victory while acknowledging that it may have played a small role in boosting recruitment for the insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;Etcheson, Craig, ''The Rise and Demise of Democratic Kampuchea'', Westview Press, 1984, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[William Shawcross]] wrote that the United States bombing and ground incursion plunged Cambodia into the chaos Sihanouk had worked for years to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, William, ''Sideshow'', Isaacs, Hardy, &amp; Brown, pgs. 92–100, 106–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook, ed., Genocide in Cambodia and Rwanda (Yale Genocide Studies Program Monograph Series No. 1, 2004), p54ff. Available online at: www.yale.edu/gsp/publications/Mosyakov.doc "In April–May 1970, significant North Vietnamese forces entered Cambodia in response to the call for help addressed to Vietnam not by Pol Pot, but by his deputy Nuon Chea.

When the [[United States Congress]] suspended military aid to the Lon Nol government in 1973, the Khmer Rouge made sweeping gains in the country, completely overwhelming the [[Khmer National Armed Forces]]. On 17 April 1975, the Khmer Rouge captured [[Phnom Penh]] and overthrew the [[Khmer Republic]], executing all its officers.

== Khmer Rouge in power ==
{{main|Democratic Kampuchea}}&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:kr4.JPG|thumb|300px|Some of the Khmer Rouge leadership during their period in power, with [[Pol Pot]] at the left (photo on display at the Tuol Sleng)]] --&gt;
The leadership of the Khmer Rouge was largely unchanged between the 1960s and the mid-1990s. The Khmer Rouge leaders were mostly from [[middle-class]] families and had been educated at French [[universities]].

The Standing Committee of the Khmer Rouge's Central Committee (Party Center) during its period of power consisted of the following:
* Brother number 1 [[Pol Pot]] (Saloth Sar) — [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Kampuchea]], 1963–1981; [[Prime Minister]] of Democratic Kampuchea, 1976–1979
* Brother number 2 [[Nuon Chea]] (Long Bunruot) — Deputy General Secretary of the Communist Party, President of the [[Kampuchean People's Representative Assembly]]
* Brother number 3 [[Ieng Sary]] — Deputy Prime Minister of Democratic Kampuchea; [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]], 1975–1979
* Brother number 4 [[Khieu Samphan]] — President of the State Presidium ([[head of state]]) of Democratic Kampuchea
* Brother number 5 [[Ta Mok]] (Chhit Chhoeun) — Leader of the [[National Army of Democratic Kampuchea]]; last Khmer Rouge leader, Southwest Regional Secretary (died in custody awaiting trial for [[genocide]], 21 July 2006)
* Brother number 8 [[Ke Pauk]] — Regional Secretary of the Northern Zone
* [[Son Sen]] — Deputy Prime Minister of Democratic Kampuchea, [[Minister of Defense]]
* [[Yun Yat]] — [[Minister of Education]], 1975–1977; [[Minister of Information]] (replaced [[Hu Nim]] in 1977)

In power, the Khmer Rouge carried out a radical program that included isolating the country from foreign influence, closing schools, hospitals and factories, abolishing [[banking]], [[finance]] and [[currency]], outlawing all [[religions]], confiscating all [[private property]] and relocating people from [[urban area]]s to [[collective farm]]s where forced labor was widespread. The purpose of this policy was to turn professional and urban Cambodians, or "Old People", into "New People" through agricultural labor. The goal was develop an economy based on the export of rice in order to later develop industry. The party adopted the slogan: "If we have rice, we can have everything".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} These actions and policies resulted in massive deaths through executions, work exhaustion, illness and starvation.

In Phnom Penh and other cities, the Khmer Rouge told residents that they would be moved only about "two or three kilometers" outside the city and would return in "two or three days". Some witnesses say they were told that the evacuation was because of the "threat of American bombing" and that they did not have to lock their houses since the Khmer Rouge would "take care of everything" until they returned. These were not the first evacuations of civilian populations by the Khmer Rouge. Similar evacuations of [[population]]s without possessions had been occurring on a smaller scale since the early 1970s.

The Khmer Rouge attempted to turn Cambodia into a classless society by depopulating cities and forcing the urban population into agricultural [[Collective farming|communes]] through brutal [[totalitarian]] methods. The entire population was forced to become farmers in [[labour camp]]s. During their four years in power, the Khmer Rouge overworked and starved the population while at the same time executing selected groups who had the potential to undermine the new state (including [[intellectuals]]) and killing many others for even minor breaches of rules.

Through the 1970s and especially after mid-1975, the party was also shaken by factional struggles. There were even armed attempts to topple Pol Pot. The resultant purges reached a crest in 1977 and 1978 when thousands, including some important CPK leaders, were executed. The older generation of communists, suspected of having links with or sympathies for Vietnam, were targeted by the Pol Pot leadership.

For roughly two years after the CPK took power, it referred to itself as the Angkar ({{lang-km|អង្គការ}}; pronounced ahngkah; meaning The Organization). However, Pol Pot publicly declared on 29 September 1977 the existence of the CPK in a five-hour-long speech.&lt;ref name="frings"/&gt; He revealed the true character of the supreme authority in Cambodia, an obscure ruling body that had been kept in seclusion.

The CPK had been extremely secretive throughout its existence. Before 1975, the secrecy was needed for the party's survival and Pol Pot and his closest associates had relied on continuing the extreme secrecy in order to consolidate their position against those they perceived as internal enemies during their first two years of power. The revelation of the CPK's existence shortly before Pol Pot was due to travel to [[Peking]] resulted from pressure from China on the Khmer Rouge leaders to acknowledge their true political identity at a time that they increasingly depended on China's assistance against the threats from Vietnam. Accordingly, Pol Pot in his speech claimed that the CPK's foundation had been in 1960 and emphasized its separate identity from [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnamese communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Milton E. ''Sihanouk Prince of Light, Prince of Darkness''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1994. {{ISBN|978-0-8248-1639-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This secrecy continued even after the CPK took power. Unlike most communist leaders, Pol Pot was not the object of an open [[Cult of personality|personality cult]]. It would be almost a year before it was confirmed that he was Saloth Sar, the man long cited as the CPK's general secretary.

== Fall of the Khmer Rouge ==
{{main|Cambodian–Vietnamese War}}
Because of several years of border conflict and the flood of [[refugees]] fleeing Cambodia, relations between Cambodia and Vietnam deteriorated by December 1978. Fearing a Vietnamese attack, Pol Pot ordered a pre-emptive invasion of Vietnam on 18 April 1978. His Cambodian forces crossed the border and looted nearby villages. Despite Chinese aid, these Cambodian forces were repulsed by the Vietnamese.

In early 1979, a pro-Vietnamese group of CPK dissidents led by [[Pen Sovan]] held a congress (which they saw as the third party congress, therefore not recognizing the 1963, 1975 and 1978 party congresses as legitimate) near the Vietnamese border. Along with [[Heng Samrin]], Pen Sovan was one of the foremost founding members of the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]] (KUFNS or FUNSK), after becoming disillusioned with the Khmer Rouge.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Osborne, ''Sihanouk, Prince of Light, Prince of Darkness.'' Silkworm 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, the CPK was then divided into two, with the Pen Sovan-led group constituting a separate party, the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (now the [[Cambodian People's Party]]).&lt;ref name="frings"/&gt;

The Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia along with the KUFNS, capturing [[Phnom Penh]] on 7 January 1979. The Pen Sovan-led party was installed as the governing party of the new [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]]. The CPK led by Pol Pot withdrew its forces westwards to an area near the Thai border. With unofficial protection from elements of the [[Royal Thai Armed Forces|Thai Army]], it began guerrilla warfare against the PRK government. The party founded the [[Patriotic and Democratic Front of the Great National Union of Kampuchea]] as a [[united front]] in September 1979 to fight the PRK and the Vietnamese. The front was led by [[Khieu Samphan]]. In December 1979, the armed forces under the command of the party, what remained of the erstwhile [[People's National Liberation Armed Forces of Kampuchea]], were renamed [[National Army of Democratic Kampuchea]].&lt;ref name="kroef"&gt;Kroef, Justus M. van der, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2643718 Cambodia: From "Democratic Kampuchea" to "People's Republic"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830041430/https://www.jstor.org/stable/2643718 |date=2018-08-30 }}'', in Asian Survey, Vol. 19, No. 8. (August 1979), pp. 731-750.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the party was dissolved and substituted by the [[Party of Democratic Kampuchea]].&lt;ref name="chandler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt;

Although the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) came to power through cooptation and peace, it maintained power for 71 years straight (1929 to 2000) by establishing patronage networks and relying on personalistic measures.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Mexican Regionalism Reconsidered|last = Drake|first = Paul|date = 1970|journal = Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs, Vol. 12, No. 3|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, Mexico functioned as a [[one-party state]] and was characterized by a system in which politicians provided bribes to their constituents in exchange for support and votes for reelection.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Political Corruption in Mexico: The Impact of Democratization|last = Morris|first = Stephen|publisher = Lynn Rienner Publishers|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Boulder, CO|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of [[clientelism]] constructed a platform through which political corruption had the opportunity to flourish: little political competition and organization outside of the party existed; it was not possible to independently contest the PRI system.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Political contestation equated to political, economic, and social isolation and neglect.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  The party remained securely in power, and government accountability was low.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  [[File:Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) logo.jpg|thumb|PRI party]] Hierarchization was the norm. Power was consolidated in the hands of an elite few, and even more narrowly, the president controlled almost all of the practical power across the three branches of government.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Perceptions and Attitudes about Corruption and Democracy in Mexico|last = Bailey|first = John|date = 2006|journal = Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, Vol 22, no. 1|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This central figure had both the formal and informal power to exercise extralegal authority over the judiciary and legislature and to relegate these other branches to the executive's individual political will.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Beyond this, few checks were set on elected officials’ actions throughout the PRI's unbroken reign.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Consequently, sustained PRI rule yielded low levels of transparency and legitimacy within the councils of Mexico's government.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 71 years of power provided an opportunity for corruption to accumulate and become increasingly complex.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Civil society developed around economic interest aggregation that was organized by the clientelistic government; the PRI allowed citizens to collectively bargain under the condition that they would continue to provide political loyalty to the party.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Tyburski |first = Michael |date = 2012 |title = The Resource Curse Reversed? Remittances and Corruption in Mexico |journal = International Studies Quarterly |publisher = Wiley |volume = 56 |issue = 2 |doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00721.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Kruszewski, Tony Payan, and Katheen Staudt explain,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A War that Can't Be Won: Binational Perspectives on the War on Drugs|last = Payan|first = Tony|publisher = University of Arizona Press|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|text="Running through the formal structure of…political institutions was a well-articulated and complex set of…networks…[that] deliberately manipulate[d] governmental resources…to advance their political aspirations and to protect their private interests and those of their clienteles and partners… Under the political geometry of an authoritarian and centralized scheme [corruption]…grew and prospered." |author=}}

With this type of institutionalized corruption, the political path in Mexico was very narrow.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There were specified political participation channels (the party) and selective electoral mobilization (party members).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These issues, deeply engrained in Mexico's political culture after over half a century's existence, have continued to generate and institutionalize political corruption in today's Mexico.

===Border Issues===
[[File:Us-mexico-border.jpg|thumb|US-Mexico border]]
[[Mexico]]’s geographic location has played largely in the development of the country’s role in [[organized crime]] and [[drug trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Administrative Surveillance and Fear: Implications for U.S.-Mexico Border Relations and Governance|last = Correa-Cabrera|first = Guadalupe|date = 2014|journal = European Review of Latin American and Caribbean Studies / Revista Europea de Estudios Latinoamericanos y del Caribe No. 96|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is Mexico adjacent to the world’s largest illegal drug market – the United States – but it also borders Central America, a region of nations with a similarly high demand for drugs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This positions Mexican drug cartels at an advantage; demand for drugs is not simply confined to the Mexican state, but rather it extends to several other nearby countries.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mexico: Narco-Violence and a Failed State?|last = Grayson|first = George|publisher = Transaction Publishers|year = 2010|isbn = |location = New Brunswick|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Mexico’s borders are especially crucial to [[drug cartels]] and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), which can exploit the borders as a passageway for contraband and as a method for consolidation of power.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As drug cartels and TCOs have increasingly made use of these areas, the groups have become progressively more complex, violent, and diverse.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Binational Human Rights: The US-Mexico Experience|last = Mueller|first = Carol|publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press|year = 2014|isbn = |location = USA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trafficking has been accompanied by other forms of illegal activity – such as extortion, kidnappings, and political corruption – as disparate factions compete for control over the same, lucrative areas.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

The Mexican government has historically accomplished very little in terms of effectively curbing the offenses of these TCOs and cartels, and has often actually been complicit in aiding their actions.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Many of Mexico’s institutions – including those for law, policy, justice, and finance – function under a patron-client system in which officials receive money, political support, or other bribes from TCOs in exchange for minimal interference in, or impunity for, those criminal groups’ affairs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In these scenarios of narco-corruption, Mexico's power structure is defined by leaders who guide TCOs’ behaviors, receive payoffs, manipulate government resources, and align public policies with legislation that will further their personal and political objectives.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; These relationships have served as an impetus for new and problematic sources of violent, drug-related deaths, ineffective governance and policy implementation, terror-based TCO tactics, and a deepening drug market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Under this system, TCOs’ influence has extended beyond violent criminal activity or drug trade, and has reached into Mexico's institutional bases.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
[[File:PAN Party (Mexico).svg|thumb|PAN party]]
These networks – alongside a lack of government transparency and checks and balances – have allowed corruption in government to flourish.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Transition to PAN Rule===
The growing prevalence and diversification of organized crime is in many ways linked to the political changes that Mexico underwent in 2000.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = La política exterior de Felipe Calderón hacia América del Norte: crisis interna y redefinición de fronteras|last = Santa Cruz|first = Arturo|date = 2013|journal = Foro Internacional |volume=53 |issue=3-4|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in 71 years, the PRI ceded power to a different party, the [[National Action Party (Mexico)]] (PAN).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The traditional power structure, which had enabled patronage networks to flourish and TCOs to operate, became challenged by government forces that attempted to curb violence and illegal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Política exterior y derechos humanos durante el gobierno de Felipe Calderón|last = Anaya Muñoz|first = Alejandro|date = 2013|journal = Foro Internacional |volume=53 |issue=3-4|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, social decomposition quickly followed the fall of the PRI.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The PAN, never before in the seat of power, was in many ways inexperienced in broad governance, and criminal factions capitalized on the party's perceived weakness. New conflicts emerged among cartels, as different groups competed to further develop their criminal networks and to work against a political regime that struggled to fight corruption, establish legitimacy, and foster legislative effectiveness.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===Calderón Administration===
During PAN President Felipe Calderón's administration, Mexico experienced a vast increase in organized crime.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The End of Nostalgia: Mexico Confronts the Challenges of Global Competition|last = Guerrero|first = Eduado|publisher = Brookings Institution Press|year = 2013|isbn = |location = USA|pages = 112–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Kruszewski, Tony Payan, and Katheen Staudt note,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; {{Quote|text=“The wave of violence [in] Mexico…[under] President Calderón…revolve[d] largely around the issue of illegal drugs, and spun off a nationwide public safety crisis and exposed the inadequacies of the Mexican administration of justice system…[It] also uncovered the deep corruption of the Mexican political forces.” |author=}}[[File:Felipe Calderon H.jpg|thumb|President Felipe Calderón (2006-2012)]]In this, beyond further diversifying criminal activity, TCOs further developed their connections to Mexico's institutions and to corruption.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Many members of the Federal Police and the Army joined TCOs, and participated in abuses against the citizenry.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Politics in Mexico: Democratic Consolidation or Decline?|last = Camp|first = Roderic|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This corruption permeated the social atmosphere along the border, where violence became increasingly heightened and fatal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
Attempting to combat this security crisis, Calderón deployed the military against criminal organizations along the border.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Enrique Peña Nieto’s National Anti-Corruption Commission and the Challenges of Waging War against Corruption in Mexico|last = Tomme|first = Mathieu|date = 2014|journal = Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, Vol. 30, No. 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rather than resolving the corruption and violence issues that pervaded the area, the army deepened problems and crime.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Citizens claimed that armed soldiers, connected to TCOs through their own patronage networks, initiated abuses against the population, including illegal searches, unwarranted arrests, beatings, theft, rape, and torture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The employment of the military by the Calderón administration exacerbated Mexico's violence and organized crime, adding human rights violations to the border's climate of lawlessness.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Balance de la política exterior de México en el sexenio de Felipe Calderón bajo los tres niveles de análists: limites y alcances|last = Velázquez Flores|first = Rafael|date = 2013|journal = Foro Internacional |volume=53 |issue=3-4|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Kruszewski, Tony Payan, and Katheen Staudt examine,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; {{Quote|text=“The Calderón administration[‘s]…use of armed forces…exposed the weaknesses [and corruption] of state and municipal authorities who had virtually abandoned certain territories to criminal groups. Surrendering public spaces to organized crime had already become a serious threat to national security and had overtaken the capabilities of local governments to do anything about it.” |author=}}The arrival of the military corresponded with institutional disintegration as the corruption of elected officials, soldiers, and police demonstrated the entrenched culture of dishonesty and illegality of Mexico's systems.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

To redact the negative products of militia employment, Calderón changed his policy strategy to one of reconstruction – rebuilding the Federal Police to have an increase in technical and operational activities, to have more comprehensive offices and departments, and to have a more selective personnel recruitment process.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; These measures reduced some of the corruption that had been embedded under his administration, but still left many realms of Mexico in the clutches of institutional corruption.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Peña Nieto Administration===
{{Main|Peñabot}}
[[File:Enrique Pena Nieto.jpg|thumb|President Enrique Peña Nieto (2012-)]]
Following Calderón's administration, the PRI returned to power under President [[Enrique Peña Nieto]]. Although new hopes for a more safe and secure Mexico accompanied the change in office, residual problems from the previous administration continued to pervade the country. TCO violence remained high, local clientelism persisted, and the drug market continued to be profitable.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mexican President's Popularity Drops Amid Corruption Scandals, Disappointing Economy|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2015/08/27/mexican-presidents-popularity-drops-amid-corruption-scandals-disappointing-economy/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With these issues still highly prominent and supported by corruption, the administration struggled to establish legitimacy and accountability within the councils of governance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These issues of legitimacy became even more defined in 2014, when Peña Nieto became entangled in numerous corruption scandals. In the most prominent and controversial case, Peña Nieto, his wife [[Angélica Rivera]], and his Finance Minister [[Luis Videgaray Caso|Luis Videgaray]] were criticized for purchasing multimillion-dollar houses from government contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mexico's president is facing the most damning charge yet — and his reputation is crumbling|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/mexicos-president-pena-nieto-and-contracts-2015-8|website = Business Insider|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations of vast impropriety surrounded the deal, and citizens began to question the veracity and legitimacy of Peña Nieto's government.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Declining Ratings for Mexico’s Peña Nieto|url = http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/08/27/declining-ratings-for-mexicos-pena-nieto/|website = Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|accessdate = 2015-11-22|first = Danielle|last = Cuddington|first2 = Richard|last2 = Wike}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, when an investigation into these allegations was launched, Public Function Ministry head Virgilio Andrade – a close personal friend of President Peña Nieto – was put in charge, and many Mexicans cited the investigation as a conflict of interest in which "the executive branch investigated itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Enrique Peña Nieto Corruption Case: Mexican President Cleared In Fraud Led By Friend Virgilio Andrade

This scandal brought about another controversy when investigative journalist [[Carmen Aristegui]] and two colleagues from MVS Radio were fired following their reports on the housing scandal. Their dismissal prompted protests and criticism, alongside a new dialogue of the Peña Nieto administration's use of “soft [[censorship]]”:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Enrique Peña Nieto Criticized For Press Freedoms Statement: Mexican President Called 'Cynical,' 'Traitor'|url = http://www.ibtimes.com/enrique-pena-nieto-criticized-press-freedoms-statement-mexican-president-called-1906983|website = International Business Times|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Quote|text="“The government [has] routinely used financial incentives and doled out penalties to punish unflattering reporting and reward favorable stories. While Mexican journalists are frequently targets of physical attack, soft censorship is another more subtle and very significant danger to press freedom” |author=}}

As of August 2016, only 23% of Mexicans approved of how Peña Nieto was dealing with corruption. by January 2017, the number had decreased to 12%.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Media ===
Among the institutions organized crime pervaded and manipulated were the media. Many TCOs violently attacked media sources that reported stories of the gangs’, cartels’, and military's abuses and relationships with political elites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Consequently, many news organizations simply stopped publishing stories about the crimes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Freedom of expression and speech were increasingly limited as the media experienced violent disputes. Outside of TCOs, state apparatuses also worked to keep negative stories under wraps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera and José Nava explain:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
{{Quote|text="Violence affecting Mexico’s border cities…has silenced the media, in a clear demonstration of the power that criminal enterprises exert over border society in drug war times…Aiding the enforcement of…silencing is the…complicity of the state itself…Due to the corruptive and coercive nature of organized crime – coupled with the weak and…corruptible state security and political institutions…, media organizations are left with no room for bias-free decision-making processes regarding the reporting of any news/notes about organized crime." |author=}}Compared to other Latin American countries, Mexico has the lowest rating for freedom of the press  – press freedom watch groups have found that the country is one of the most dangerous in the world to be a professional journalist.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The international human rights group Article 19 found that in 2014 alone, more than 325 journalists experienced aggressive action by government officials and organized crime, and five reporters were killed due to their line of work.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, since 2005, at least 32 journalists have been killed because of their profession in Mexico.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:Flag of Cyprus.svg|thumb|right|[[Flag of Cyprus]]]]
'''Cypriot nationalism''', also known as '''Cypriotism''', refers to one of the [[nationalism]]s of [[Cyprus]]. It focuses on the shared identity of [[Greek Cypriots]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]], highlighting their common culture, heritage, traditions, and economic, political, and social rights.&lt;ref name="HayMenon2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Colin Hay|author2=Anand Menon|title=European Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|date=18 January 2007|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-928428-3|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cypriot nationalism supports the reunification of Cyprus and the end of foreign interference by [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="HayMenon2007"/&gt; Cypriotism tends to be anti-British, anti-Greek, and anti-Turkish, arguing that these nations have historically worked (and currently are working) against the interests of Cyprus' independence and people.

==Development and support==
Originally, the idea of a common "Cypriot identity" was viewed very suspiciously by both [[Greek Cypriots]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]]; it was seen as an attempt by the British rulers of Cyprus to create an artificial identity for the island's inhabitants, in order to perpetuate their rule.&lt;ref name="volkan"&gt;[http://www.academia.edu/25512778/CYPRUS_War_and_Adaptaion Vamik Volkan, Cyprus: War and Adaptation]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the rise of the internationalist ideas of both [[liberalism]] and the [[Left (politics)|political Left]], variants of a Cypriot identity began to be cultivated and espoused by native Cypriot political groups (both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot), most notably the [[Progressive Party of Working People]] (AKEL),&lt;ref name="Anastasiou2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anastasiou |first=Maria |date=2007 |title=The Institutionalization of Protracted Ethnic Conflicts: A Discourse Analysis of "The Cyprus Problem" |url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=WW7yUeyY8-gC&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq |publisher=ProQuest |publication-date=2007 |isbn=9780549209935 |pages=129 |access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the liberal [[United Democrats (Cyprus)|United Democrats]]&lt;ref name="HayMenon2007"/&gt; and organisations like the [[Union of Cypriots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Aldrich |first=Alan |date=17 August 2018 |title=Cypriotism in the Twenty-First Century |url=https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/08/17/cypriotism-in-the-twenty-first-century/ |dead-url= |magazine=[[Bella Caledonia]] |location=Scotland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180821064324/https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/08/17/cypriotism-in-the-twenty-first-century/ |archive-date=21 August 2018 |access-date=21 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], which followed a [[1974 Cypriot coup d'état|coup d’état in Cyprus]] ordered by the military junta in Greece, led to a revival of Cypriot nationalism.&lt;ref name="Madianou2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mirca Madianou|title=Mediating the Nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V5lDaSGNZrkC&amp;pg=PA40|date=12 November 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-61105-6|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to Cypriotism==
Cypriotism is strongly opposed by both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot nationalists.&lt;ref name="volkan"&gt;[http://www.academia.edu/25512778/CYPRUS_War_and_Adaptaion Vamik Volkan, Cyprus: War and Adaptation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madianou2012"/&gt;  

Among Greek Cypriots identifying as Greeks above all else, the central political slogan has always been "Cyprus is Greek".&lt;ref name="Madianou2012"/&gt; Political parties such as [[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|DIKO]], [[Movement for Social Democracy|EDEK]] and the Greek nationalist wing of [[Democratic Rally|DISY]], as well as the [[Church of Cyprus]], dismiss Cypriotism as a betrayal of Greek history and identity, and a sell-out to foreign interests who wish for Cyprus to submit to Turkish aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Waldman and Catherine Mason, Encyclopedia of European Peoples, 2006, pp. 194-195&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Turkish Cypriots, the idea of Cypriotism was vociferously rejected by the long-serving Turkish Cypriot leader [[Rauf Denktaş]],&lt;ref name="volkan"&gt;[http://www.academia.edu/25512778/CYPRUS_War_and_Adaptaion Vamik Volkan, Cyprus: War and Adaptation]&lt;/ref&gt; who believed that "in Cyprus there are Greeks and Turks", and that "the only true Cypriot is the [[Cyprus donkey]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/15/rauf-denktash-obituary The Guardian, Rauf Denktash obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="volkan"&gt;[http://www.academia.edu/25512778/CYPRUS_War_and_Adaptaion Vamik Volkan, Cyprus: War and Adaptation]&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, [[National Unity Party (Northern Cyprus)|UBP]], the political party founded by him, believes that Cypriot nationalism is a Greek ploy to subjugate and assimilate Turkish Cypriots.

==Adoption of aspects of Cypriotism by some Greek Cypriot nationalists==
President [[Tassos Papadopoulos]], generally seen as a Greek nationalist, can be said to have adopted a strategy of Cypriot nationalism (called "a strategy of osmosis" by him) by which he offered individual benefits to Turkish Cypriots (such as [[Republic of Cyprus]] passports, free medical care, employment opportunities etc.) while at the same time maintaining a very hard line towards the (internationally unrecognised) breakaway Turkish Cypriot administration. Thus Papadopoulos hoped to cultivate an allegiance to the Government of Cyprus among some Turkish Cypriots, and exacerbate the already existing tensions between the Turkish Cypriots and the [[Turkish settlers in Northern Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academia.edu/36718092/The_Cyprus_Stalemate_What_Next Nathalie Tocci, The Cyprus Stalemate: What Next?]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hindu scriptures}}
'''Dharma-yuddha''' is a [[Sanskrit]] word made up of two roots: ''[[dharma]]'' meaning righteousness, and ''yuddha'' meaning warfare. In the [[Hindu scripture|ancient Indian texts]], dharma-yuddha refers to a war that is fought while following several rules that make the war fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia: From Antiquity to the Present|page=28|publisher=Cambridge University|author=Kaushik Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, in a righteous war, equals fight equals. Chariot warriors are not supposed to attack [[cavalry]] and [[infantry]], those on elephants are not supposed to attack [[infantry]], and so on. The rules also forbid the usage of [[Astra (weapon)|celestial weapons]] (divine weapons bestowed by the gods) on ordinary soldiers (as opposed to soldiers of noble birth). The build-up of weapons and armies is done with the full knowledge of the opposing side and no surprise attacks are made. 

The rules of engagement also set out how warriors were to deal with noncombatants. No one should attack an enemy who has temporarily lost or dropped their weapon. The lives of women, prisoners of war, and farmers were also sacred. [[Pillaging]] the land was forbidden. 

Dharma-yuddha also signifies that the war is not fought for gain or selfish reasons. A dharma-yuddha is waged to uphold the principles of righteousness. 

== In the ''Mahabharata'' == 
In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' epic, which describes the [[Kurukshetra war]], the two sides agree on the following rules: 

* Fighting must begin no earlier than sunrise and, should end by exact sunset. (Broken on the 14th day, after [[Jayadratha]] was slain).
* Multiple warriors must not attack a single warrior. (Broken several times, most notably in the 13th day, when [[Abhimanyu]] was slain).
* Two warriors may duel, or engage in prolonged personal combat, only if they carry the same weapons and they are on the same mount (no mount, a horse, an elephant, or a chariot). (Broken several times).
* No warrior may kill or injure a warrior who has surrendered. (Violated when [[Satyaki]] slew an unarmed Burishravas).
* One who surrenders becomes a [[prisoner of war]] and will then be subject to the protections of a [[prisoner of war]]. 
* No warrior may kill or injure an unarmed warrior. (Broken when [[Arjuna]] slew [[Karna]] when the latter was unarmed trying to take out his chariot wheel from mud ).
* No warrior may kill or injure an unconscious warrior. (Broken when [[Abhimanyu]] was slain).
* No warrior may kill or injure a person or animal not taking part in the war. (Broken several times when warriors slew horses and charioteers of their enemies).
* No warrior may kill or injure a warrior whose back is turned away. ([[Shakuni]] and [[Arjuna]] broke that rule).
* No warrior may strike an animal not considered a direct threat. (Broken when [[Bhima]] killed an elephant named [[Ashwathama]]). 
* The rules specific to each weapon must be followed. For example, it is prohibited to strike below the waist in mace warfare (Broken in the final combat of [[Bhima]] and [[Duryodhana]] on night of final day of war).
* Warriors must not engage in any 'unfair' warfare whatsoever. 
* The lives of women, prisoners of war, and farmers are sacred. 
* Land should not be pillaged.

{{italic title}}
'''''Divini Redemptoris''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for '''Of the Divine Redeemer''') is an [[anti-communist]] [[encyclical]] issued by [[Pope Pius XI]].  It was published on 19 March 1937. In this encyclical, the pope sets out to "expose once more in a brief synthesis the principles of [[atheism|atheistic]] [[Communism]] as they are manifested chiefly in [[bolshevism]]".

Mariano Cordovani O.P. (February 25, 1883 &amp;ndash; April 4, 1950) professor of dogmatic theology at the College of Saint Thomas, the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] from 1912 to 1921 and [[Theologian of the Pontifical Household|Master of the Sacred Palace]] under [[Pope Pius XI]] contributed especially to the encyclical and afterward published his ''Appunti sul comunismo moderno'' treating the Church's position on communism.&lt;ref&gt;http://freeforumzone.leonardo.it/lofi/STELLE-DOMENICANE/D8387544.html Accessed June 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/felice-cordovani_(Dizionario-Biografico)/  Accessed May 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The encyclical describes communism as "''a system full of errors and [[Sophistry|sophisms]]''" that "subverts the social order, because it means the destruction of its foundations" as well as removing women from their rightful place in the home.

Pius XI goes on to contrast Communism with the ''civitas humana'' (ideal human civilization), which is marked by love, respect for human dignity, economic justice, and the rights of workers.  He faults industrialists and employers who do not adequately support their workers for creating a climate of discontent in which people are tempted to embrace [[Communism]].  He refers to two earlier papal writings on this topic, ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' and ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]''.

The work expresses concern at the growth of Communism in the [[Soviet Union]], [[Second Spanish Republic|Spain]], and [[Mexico]], and it condemns the [[Western world|Western]] press for its apparent "conspiracy of silence" in failing to cover such events in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclical]] ''Divini Redemptoris'', § 18 (AAS 29 [1937], 74).&lt;/ref&gt;  It was published five days after the publication of the more controversial ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical that condemned the German [[Nazi]] regime and ideology.

'''"Economic Calculation In The Socialist Commonwealth"''' is an article by [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Its [[economic calculation problem|critique against economic calculation]] in a [[planned economy]] triggered the decades-long [[economic calculation debate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Hacohen | first=Malachi Haim | year=2002 | title=Karl Popper: the formative years, 1902-1945 : politics and philosophy in interwar Vienna | edition=reprint | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-89055-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtHcYGp2pIC&amp;pg=PA477 | page=477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/econcalc.asp |title=Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth by Ludwig von Mises |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article was first published 1920 in [[German language|German]] under the title ''Die Wirtschaftsrechnung im sozialistischen Gemeinwesen''&lt;ref name="Huerta de Soto" /&gt; and based on a lecture Mises gave in 1919 as a response to a book by [[Otto Neurath]], arguing for the feasibility of central planning.&lt;ref name="Huerta de Soto"&gt;{{citation | last=Huerta de Soto | first=Jesús | year=2010 | title=Socialism, Economic Calculation and Entrepreneurship | publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing | isbn=978-1-84980-065-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHcxcMHlXdgC&amp;pg=PA103 | pages=103–104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mises argued that no prices for capital goods could be obtained in a socialist economy if the government owned the [[means of production]] since all exchanges would be internal transfers, rather than "objects of exchange", setting the [[price mechanism]] out of order.

Two years later, the essay was incorporated into Mises's ''[[Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis]]''.

{{For|electoral divisions of UK local authorities|Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom}}

An '''electoral district''', ('''election''') '''precinct''', '''election district''', or '''legislative district''', called a '''voting district''' by the [[US Census]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographic Terms and Concepts - Voting Districts|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_vtd.html|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as a '''constituency''', '''riding''', '''ward''', '''division''', '''electoral area''', or '''electorate''') is a territorial subdivision for [[election|electing]] members to a [[legislative body]]. Generally, only voters (constituents) who [[Residency (domicile)|reside]] within the district are permitted to vote in an election held there.  From a single district, a [[Single-member district|single member]] or multiple members might be chosen.  Members might be chosen by a [[first past the post | first-past-the-post]] system or a [[Proportional representation|proportional representative]] system, or another [[voting system|voting method]] entirely.  Members might be chosen through a direct election under [[universal suffrage]], an [[indirect election]], or another form of [[suffrage]].

==Terminology==
{{See also|List of electoral districts by nation}}
The names for electoral districts vary across countries and, occasionally, for the office being elected. The term ''constituency'' is commonly used to refer to an electoral district, especially in British English, but it can also refer to the body of eligible voters or all the residents of the represented area or only those who voted for a certain candidate. The terms ''(election) precinct'' and ''election district'' are more common in American English. In Australia and New Zealand, electoral districts are called ''electorates'', however elsewhere the term ''electorate'' generally refers specifically to the body of voters.
In [[India]] electoral districts are referred to as "''Nirvachan Kshetra''" ({{lang-hi|निर्वाचन क्षेत्र}}) in [[Hindi]], which can be literally translated to English as "electoral area" though the official English translation for the term is "constituency". The term "Nirvachan Kshetra" is used while referring to an electoral district in general irrespective of the legislature. When referring to a particular legislatorial constituency, it is simply referred to as "Kshetra" along with the name of the legislature, in Hindi (e.g.-'Lok Sabha Kshetra' for a [[Lok Sabha]] Constituency). Electoral districts for municipal or other local bodies are called "wards".
In Canada, districts are colloquially called ''[[riding (country subdivision)|ridings]]'' (stemming from an earlier British geographical subdivision); in French, ''circonscription'' or (colloquially) ''comté'', "county." Local electoral districts are sometimes called ''[[ward (electoral subdivision)|ward]]s'', a term which also designates administrative subdivisions of a municipality. In [[local government in the Republic of Ireland]] voting districts are called "electoral areas".

==District magnitude==
''District magnitude'' is the number of representatives elected from a given district to the same legislative body.  A ''[[single-member district]]'' has one representative, while a ''multi-member district'' has more than one.  Voting systems that seek [[proportional representation]] (such as the [[single transferable vote]]) inherently require multi-member districts, and the larger the district magnitude the more proportional a system will tend to be (and the greater the number of distinct parties or choices that can be represented.) Non-proportional systems may use multi-member districts, as in the [[House of Commons]] until 1950, [[Elections in Singapore|Singapore]]'s [[Group Representation Constituency]], or the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]].
[[File:Michael Moore LibDem MP Office.jpg|thumbnail|right|Representatives from electoral districts typically have offices in their respective districts. This photo shows the office of Michael Moore, a Member of Parliament (MP) in the UK.]]
Under proportional representation systems, district magnitude is an important determinant of the makeup of the elected body. With a larger number of winners, candidates are able to represent proportionately smaller [[minority group|minorities]]; a 10% minority in a given district may secure no seats in a 5-member election but would be guaranteed a seat in a 9-member one because they fulfill a [[Droop quota]].

The geographic distribution of minorities also affects their representation - an unpopular nationwide minority can still secure a seat if they are concentrated in a particular district. District magnitude can sometimes vary within the same system during an election. In the [[Republic of Ireland]], for instance, national elections to [[Dáil Éireann]] are held using a combination of 3, 4, and 5 member districts. In Hong Kong, the magnitude ranged from 3 to 5 in 1998, when the current electoral system 
was introduced for Legislative Council geographical constituency  elections, and will range from 5 to 9 in the forthcoming election in September 2012.

The only democracies with one single nationwide electoral district and no other territorial correctors are Fiji, Israel, The Netherlands, Moldova, Mozambique, Slovakia and South Africa.

==Apportionment and redistricting==
:''Main articles: [[Apportionment (politics)|Apportionment]] and [[Redistricting]]
''Apportionment'' is the process of allocating a number of representatives to different regions, such as states or provinces.  Apportionment changes are often accompanied by ''redistricting'', the redrawing of electoral district boundaries to accommodate the new number of representatives. This redrawing is necessary under single-member district systems, as each new representative requires their own district. Multi-member systems, however, vary depending on other rules. Ireland, for example, redraws its electoral districts after every census&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0025/sec0005.html §5: Establishment of Constituency Commission; Electoral Act, 1997] Irish Statute Book&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Belgium]] uses its existing administrative boundaries for electoral districts and instead modifies the number of representatives allotted to each. [[Israel]] and the [[Netherlands]] avoid the need for apportionment entirely by electing legislators [[at-large]].

Apportionment is generally done on the basis of [[population]]. Seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]], for instance, are reapportioned to individual states every 10 years following a [[census]], with some states that have grown in population gaining seats. By contrast, seats in the [[Cantonal Council of Zürich]] are reapportioned in every election [[biproportional apportionment|based on the number of votes cast in each district]], which is only made possible by use of multi-member districts, and the [[House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], by contrast, is apportioned without regard to population; the three major ethnic groups - [[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs]], and [[Croats]] - each get exactly five members.  ''[[Malapportionment]]'' occurs when voters are under- or over-represented due to variation in district population.

Given the complexity of this process, software is increasingly used to simplify the task, while better supporting reproducible and more justifiable results. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Gerrymandering ===
{{main|Gerrymandering}}
''Gerrymandering'' is the manipulation of electoral district boundaries for political gain. By creating a few "forfeit" districts where opposing candidates win overwhelmingly, gerrymandering politicians can manufacture more, but narrower, wins for themselves and their party. Gerrymandering relies on the [[wasted vote|wasted-vote effect]], effectively concentrating wasted votes among opponents while minimizing wasted votes among supporters. Consequently, gerrymandering is typically done under voting systems using single-member districts, which have more wasted votes.

While much more difficult, gerrymandering can also be done under proportional-voting systems when districts elect very few seats. By making three-member districts in regions where a particular group has a slight majority, for instance, gerrymandering politicians can obtain 2/3 of that district's seats. Similarly, by making four-member districts in regions where the same group has slightly less than a majority, gerrymandering politicians can still secure exactly half of the seats.

However, any possible gerrymandering that theoretically could occur would be much less effective because minority groups can still elect at least one representative if they make up a significant percentage of the population (e.g. 20-25%). Compare this to single-member districts where 40-49% of the voters can be essentially shut out from any representation.

==Swing seats and safe seats==
:''Main articles: [[Marginal seat]] and [[Safe seat]]''
Sometimes, particularly under non-proportional winner-take-all voting systems, electoral districts can be prone to [[landslide election|landslide victories]].  A ''safe seat'' is one that is very unlikely to be won by a rival politician due to the makeup of its [[constituency]]. Conversely, a ''swing seat'' is one that could easily ''swing'' either way.  In [[Elections in the United Kingdom#General elections|United Kingdom general elections]] and [[United States]] presidential and congressional elections, the voting in a relatively small number of swing seats usually determines the outcome of the entire election. Many politicians aspire to have safe seats.  &lt;!-- note how in places like the UK party leadership tend to get safe seats so they can still lead the party in parliament without risking losing an election.  Find an example of someone losing leadership because they lost their seat.--&gt;
In large [[multi-party system]]s like [[India]], swing seats can lead to a [[Hung assembly]] like situation if a significant number of seats go for regional parties instead of the larger national parties who are the main competitors at the national or state level, as was the situation in the [[Lok Sabha]] (Lower house of The [[Parliament of India]]) during the decade of the 1990s.

==Constituency work==
Elected representatives may spend much of the time serving the needs or demands of individual ''constituents'', meaning either voters or residents of their district. This is more common in assemblies with many single-member or small districts than those with fewer, larger districts. In a looser sense, corporations and other such organizations can be referred to as constituents, if they have a significant presence in an area.

Many assemblies allow free postage (through [[franking privilege]] or [[prepaid envelope]]s) from a representative to a constituent, and often free telecommunications. [[Caseworker (politics)|Caseworkers]] may be employed by representatives to assist constituents with problems. Members of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] (both Representatives and Senators) working in Washington, D.C. have a governmentally staffed district office to aid in "constituent services". Many state legislatures have followed suit. Likewise, [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British MPs]] use their Parliamentary staffing allowance to appoint staff for "constituency casework". [[Client politics]] and [[pork barrel]] politics are associated with constituency work.

==Special constituencies with additional membership requirements==
In some elected assemblies, some or all constituencies may group voters based on some criterion other than, or in addition to, the location they live. Examples include:
* By ethnic groups: [[Communal constituencies]] in Fiji; [[Reserved political positions in India|reserved seats in India]] for [[Anglo-Indian]]s and [[scheduled castes and scheduled tribes]]; [[Māori electorates]] in New Zealand.
* By qualification: [[University constituency]] in Britain and Ireland, [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituency]] in Hong Kong

== Voting without constituencies ==
Not all democratic political systems use separate districts or other electoral subdivisions to conduct elections. [[Politics of Israel|Israel]], for instance, conducts parliamentary elections as a single district, while the 26 electoral districts in [[Politics of Italy|Italy]] and the 20 in the [[Politics of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] have a role in the actual election, but no role whatsoever in the division of the seats. [[Ukraine]] elected half of the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (the Ukrainian Parliament) in this way in the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2012|elections in October 2012]].&lt;ref name=newUKRelectionlawof171111&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/117151/ "Parliament Passes Law on Parliamentary Elections"], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'', 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11754">'''Environmentally extended input-output analysis (EEIOA)''' is used in [[environmental accounting]] as a tool which reflects production and consumption structures within one or several economies. As such, it is becoming an important addition to [[material flow accounting]].

==Introduction==
In recognition of the increasing importance of global resource use mediated by international trade for environmental accounting and policy, new perspectives have been and are currently being developed within environmental accounting. The most prominent among these are consumption-based accounts compiled using environmentally extended input-output analysis. Consumption-based indicators of material use are commonly referred to as “material footprints”&lt;ref&gt;Wiedmann, T.O., Schandl, H., Lenzen, M., Moran, D., Suh, S., West, J., Kanemoto, K., 2013. The material footprint of nations. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/08/28/1220362110.abstract&lt;/ref&gt; (comparable to [[carbon footprint]]s and [[water footprint]]s) or as raw material equivalents (RME) for imported and exported goods.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffartzik, A., Eisenmenger, N., Krausmann, F., Weisz, H., 2013. Consumption-based Material Flow Accounting. J. Ind. Ecol. http://edoc.gfz-potsdam.de/pik/get/6248/0/bfdc8ec1a2f0ae2680ed83864b86893c/www.aau.at/sec.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schoer, K., Weinzettel, J., Kovanda, J., Giegrich, J., Lauwigi, C., 2012. Raw Material Consumption of the European Union - Concept, Calculation Method, and Results. Environ. Sci. Technol. 46, 8903–8909. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es300434c&lt;/ref&gt; Raw material equivalents or material footprints of traded goods comprise the material inputs required along the entire supply chain associated with their production. This includes both direct and indirect flows: For example, the ore mined to extract the metal contained in a mobile phone as well as the coal needed to generate the electricity needed to produce the metal concentrates would be included. In order to allocate domestic extraction to exported goods, information on the production and trade structure of an economy is required. In monetary terms, information on the production structure is contained in commonly available economy-wide [[Input-output model|input-output tables]] (IOT) which recently have been combined with trade statistics to form multi-regional IO (MRIO) tables.

==Input-Output Analysis for EEIOA==
In the following, a short introduction to [[Input-output model|input-output analysis]] and its environmental extension for the calculation of material footprints or RME indicators is provided.
The inter-industry flows within an economy form an {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&amp;times;&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} matrix {{math|'''''Z'''''}} and the total output of each industry is forms an {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&amp;times;1}} vector {{math|'''''x'''''}}. By dividing each flow into an industry (i.e., each element of {{math|'''''Z'''''}}) by the total output of that same industry, we obtain an {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&amp;times;&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} matrix of so-called technical coefficients {{math|'''''A'''''}}. In [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebra, this reads as follows:

&lt;math&gt;A = Z \times \hat{x}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; represents the vector {{math|'''''x'''''}} diagonlized into a matrix (&lt;math&gt;\hat{x} = I\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;)

Matrix {{math|'''''A'''''}} contains the multipliers for the inter-industry inputs required to supply one unit of industry output. A certain total economic output {{math|'''''x'''''}} is required to satisfy a given level of final demand {{math|'''''y'''''}}. This final demand may be domestic (for private households as well as the public sector) or foreign (exports) and can be written as an {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&amp;times;1}} vector. When this vector of final demand {{math|'''''y'''''}} is multiplied by the [[Leontief]] inverse {{math|('''''I'''''&amp;minus;'''''A''''')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, we obtain total output {{math|'''''x'''''}}. {{math|'''''I'''''}} is the identity matrix so that the following matrix equation is the result of equivalence operations in our previous equation:

&lt;math&gt;\vec x = \left ( I - A \right )^{-1} \times \vec y&lt;/math&gt;

The Leontief inverse contains the multipliers for the direct and indirect inter-industry inputs required to provide 1 unit of output to final demand. Next to the inter-industry flows recorded in {{math|'''''Z'''''}}, each industry requires additional inputs (e.g. energy, materials, capital, labour) and outputs (e.g. emissions) which can be introduced into the calculation with the help of an environmental extension. This commonly takes the shape of an {{math|&lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;&amp;times;&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} matrix {{math|'''''M'''''}} of total factor inputs or outputs: Factors are denoted in a total of {{math|''m''}} rows and the industries by which they are required are included along {{math|''n''}} columns. Allocation of factors to the different industries in the compilation of the extension matrix requires careful review of industry statistics and national emissions inventories. In case of lacking data, expert opinions or additional modelling may be required to estimate the extension. Once completed, {{math|'''''M'''''}} can be transformed into a direct factor requirements matrix per unit of useful output {{math|'''''F'''''}}, and the calculation is analogous to determination of the monetary direct multipliers matrix {{math|'''''A'''''}} (see first equation):

&lt;math&gt;F = M \times \hat x ^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Consumption-based accounting of resource use and emissions can be performed by post-multiplying the monetary input-output relation by the industry-specific factor requirements:

&lt;math&gt;E = F(I-A)^{-1} \times \vec y&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is the core of environmentally extended input-output analysis: The final demand vector {{math|'''''y'''''}} can be split up into a domestic and a foreign (exports) component, which makes it possible to calculate the material inputs associated with each.

The matrix {{math|'''''F'''''}} integrates material flow data into input-output analysis. It allows us to allocate economy-wide material requirements to specific industries. With the help of the coefficients contained in the Leontief inverse {{math|('''''I'''''&amp;minus;'''''A''''')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the material requirements can be allocated to domestic or foreign (exports) final demand. In order to consider variations in production structures across different economies or regions, national input-output tables are combined to form so-called multi-regional input-output (MRIO) models. In these models, the sum total of resources allocated to final consumption equals the sum total of resources extracted, as recorded in the material flow accounts for each of the regions.

==Critical Issues==
Environmentally extended input-output analysis comes with a number of assumptions which have to be kept in mind when interpreting the results of such studies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Homogeneity of products''': Calculations based on the standard IO model make it necessary to assume that each economic activity produces only one physically homogeneous product. In reality, however, the high level of aggregation of activities (e.g., in most European IO tables, all mining is included in the same activity irrespective of the specific material) leads to inhomogeneous outputs. In addition, many industries generate by-products (e.g., a paper mill may also produce saw dust); and this additionally violates the assumption of homogeneity of outputs. Along the same lines, when this method is used to ascribe environmental impacts, not all the products in a given sector have the same emissions. An average is used. But for instance in terms of power generation, the emissions from coal based power generation are very different from those of solar power generation. An assumption is made here that the global mixture is being used, when actually power generation may be available only from one source.
'''Homogeneity of prices''': In using the standard IO model, it is also necessary to assume that each industry sells its characteristic output to all other economic activities and to final consumers at the same price. In reality, however, this is not always true as illustrated by the example of electricity which costs less in the primary than in the tertiary sectors and/or final consumption. In addition, the aforementioned heterogeneity of industry output will cause this assumption to be violated: For example, a sector buying mostly aluminum from the non-ferrous metal industries is likely to pay a different price than a sector that mostly buys rare earth metals.
'''Constant Returns to Scale''': IO models assume that when production is scaled, all the inputs and outputs scale by the same factor.
'''Allocation of investments''': In creating a consumption-based account of material flows, it is necessary to decide how investments are allocated within the production and consumption structure. In national accounting, investments are reported as part of final demand. From a consumption-based perspective, they can also be thought of as an input into the production process (e.g., machinery and production infrastructure are necessary inputs to production). The manner in which capital investments are included and how (or if) they are depreciated, significantly impacts the results obtained for the raw material equivalents of exports.&lt;ref&gt;Schoer, K., Weinzettel, J., Kovanda, J., Giegrich, J., Lauwigi, C., 2012. Raw Material Consumption of the European Union - Concept, Calculation Method, and Results. Environ. Sci. Technol. 46, 8903–8909. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es300434c&lt;/ref&gt; If infrastructure investments (whether in monetary terms or as domestic extraction of construction materials) are not depreciated over time, importing one and the same product from an emerging economy currently building up its infrastructure will be associated with much more embodied material than importing it from a mature economy which has significantly invested into its infrastructure in the past.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Understanding the impact and eventually resolving these methodological issues will become important items on the environmental accounting research agenda. At the same time, interest is already growing in the interpretability of the results of such consumption-based approaches. It has yet to be determined how responsibility for material investments into the production of exports should be shared in general: While it is true that the importing economy receives the benefit of the ready-made product, it is also true that the exporting economy receives the benefit of income.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of these political implications for &lt;math&gt;CO_{2}&lt;/math&gt; emissions embodied in trade, refer to Jakob, M., Marschinski, R., 2012. Interpreting trade-related CO2 emission transfers. Nat. Clim. Change 3, 19–23. http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v3/n1/full/nclimate1630.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6329">A '''faggot voter''' or '''faggot''' was a person who qualified to vote in an election with a restricted [[suffrage]] only by the exploitation of [[loophole]]s in the regulations. Typically, faggot voters satisfied a property qualification by holding the [[Title (property)|title]] to a subdivision of a large property with a single [[beneficial owner]]. Faggot voting was a common [[Electoral fraud|electoral abuse]] in the [[United Kingdom]] until the [[electoral reform]]s of the late 19th century. Faggot voting was abolished by the [[Representation of the People Act 1884]].

Political reform continued during the [[Victorian era]], eventually leading to [[universal suffrage]]. The notion of '''faggot voting''' became an archaic curiosity and the term fell into disuse. It is now rarely mentioned.

==Etymology==
The word ''faggot'' originally meant a piece or bundle of gathered [[firewood]]. It was later applied to civilians added to a military [[muster roll]] purely to make up the numbers rather than to serve as [[Soldier|soldiers]]. The extension from muster rolls to [[electoral roll]]s is attested from 1817.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Henry|title=Oxford English Dictionary |editor=James Murray |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1901 |edition=1st |chapter=faggot-vote |volume=4 (part 1) |page=20 |url=https://archive.org/stream/newenglishdictio04murruoft#page/n31/mode/1up }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word in an electoral context has nothing to do with many other uses of the word, such as [[Faggot (food)|cuisine known as a ''faggot'']], [[Basic_knitted_fabrics#Faggoting|''faggotting'']] in terms of [[knitting]], and the more recently common sense of [[Faggot (slang)|''faggot'' as a pejorative]] for someone known as or perceived as [[homosexual]], [[bisexual]], or [[transgender]].

==Practices==
In the [[unreformed House of Commons]], and for decades after the [[Reform Act 1832]], the qualifications for voting varied between different  [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]]. However in many constituencies, suffrage was restricted to those with an "interest" (i.e. in [[property]]) in the constituency, i.e. [[real estate]]. If a landowner subdivided a single property into multiple units, and transferred the title of each unit into the name of a separate person, each titleholder could then [[Electoral registration in the United Kingdom|register to vote]].&lt;ref name="porritt"/&gt; These "faggot voters" would generally vote according to the wishes of the original landowner. The lack of a [[secret ballot]] ensured that the "faggot" complied with the landowner's wishes. Prohibition of [[vote buying]] was difficult to enforce if the faggot was an employee of the landowner. There was no requirement for a voter to be [[Residency (domicile)|resident]] in the constituency; the landowner and faggot voter might both reside outside the constituency.&lt;ref name="porritt"/&gt;

Although the original [[Forty Shilling Freeholders|forty shilling freehold suffrage]] of 1432 applied to [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] rather than [[leasehold]], it had been widened gradually over the centuries, increasing the number of loopholes by which faggot voters might register.&lt;ref name="porritt"/&gt; Edward Porritt found the earliest instances of faggot voting in the 1620s under [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref name="porritt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Porritt|first=Edward |others=assisted by Annie G. Porritt|title=The Unreformed House of Commons: Parliamentary Representation before 1832|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1903 |volume=1: England and Wales |pages=22–24 |chapter=II: The County Franchise |url=https://archive.org/stream/unreformedhouse00porrgoog#page/n49/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliamentary Elections Act 1695]] (7 &amp; 8 Will. III c.25) prohibited subdivision of [[tenement (law)|tenement]]s for this purpose.&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt; In the 18th century, a freehold would be [[conveyancing|conveyed]] to the faggot just before the election, and back again straight after the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farrant|first=John H. |year=2001 |title=The family circle and career of William Burrell, antiquary|journal=Sussex Archaeological Collections  |volume=139 |pages=169–85 |url=http://www.whosyerdad-e.com/docs/williamburrell.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sheriffs of the City of London]] are elected by the [[Liverymen]] of the [[Livery Company]]s. [[Richard Causton, 1st Baron Southwark|Richard Causton]], himself an MP and liveryman, said in the debate on the [[Local Government Act 1888]] that "anyone who wanted a vote could go down to the City with £12 in his pocket, and get the right to vote ... There were liverymen who had no connection with the City beyond the fact that they were faggot voters". His amendment to restrict the vote to "men who had business in the City of London" was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1888/jul/12/application-of-act-to-boroughs-the#S3V0328P0_18880712_HOC_327 | house=House of Commons |title=Application of Act to Boroughs, the Metropolis, and Certain Special Counties | date=12 July 1888 | column_start=1182 | column_end=1183 |speaker=Mr Richard Causton |position=Member for [[Southwark West (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark West]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition==
Subdivision of property other than to [[bona fide]] titleholders was prohibited for the franchise in [[borough constituency|borough constituencies]] by the [[Representation of the People Act 1867]] and in [[county constituency|county constituencies]] by the [[Representation of the People Act 1884]]. However, previously enrolled faggot voters retained their vote until death. This was rendered irrelevant by the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], which introduced [[manhood suffrage]], and abolished virtually all property qualifications.

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}

The '''Fifth Colijn''' was the [[cabinet of the Netherlands]] from 25 July 1939 until 10 August 1939. The cabinet was formed by the [[List of political parties in the Netherlands|political parties]] [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP), [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) and the [[Liberal State Party]] (LSP) following the fall of the [[Fourth Colijn cabinet]] on 29 June 1939. The [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] cabinet was a [[minority government]] in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]. It was the last of five cabinets of [[Hendrikus Colijn]], the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party#Leadership|Leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party]] as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]]. The cabinet was dismissed by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] just 2 days after taking office on 27 July 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Herman Langeveld|title=Hendrikus Colijn 1869-1944 Deel II 1933-1944: Schipper naast God|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=enJgBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hendrikus+Colijn+1869-1944&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifs7CBwpTcAhWSbFAKHQQBCgkQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hendrikus%20Colijn%201869-1944&amp;f=false|year=1998|publisher=Balans|isbn=9789460034480|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{cite web|url=https://historiek.net/hendrikus-colijn-premier-crisisjaren/69176/|title=Hendrikus Colijn (1869-1944) – Premier tijdens de crisisjaren 1930|publisher=Historiek|date=23 May 2017|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn2/colijn|title=Colijn, Hendrikus (1869-1944)|publisher=Resources Huygens|date=10 July 2006|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{cite web|url=https://www.historischnieuwsblad.nl/nl/artikel/41761/hendrikus-colijn.html|title=Hendrikus Colijn|publisher=Historisch Nieuwsblad|date=10 November 2017|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{cite web|url=https://www.dehsvl.nl/formeren-kun-je-leren/|title=Formeren kun je leren|publisher=Historische Studievereniging Leiden|date=22 March 2017|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{cite web|url=https://isgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/de-korte-regering-van-het-kabinet-colijn-v|title=De korte regering van het Kabinet Colijn-V|publisher=IsGeschiedenis|date=6 January 2015|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30624">'''Genetic engineering in Hawaii''' is a hotly contested political topic. The [[Hawaiian islands]] counties of [[Kauai]], [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] and [[Maui]] passed or considered laws restricting the practice within their borders due to concerns about the health, the environment and impacts on conventional and organic agriculture.&lt;ref name=sa08&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/genetically-modified-hawaii/ |title=Genetically Modified Hawaii New varieties of genetically engineered crops thrive in the world's most isolated landmass |date=December 8, 2008 |first=Robynne |last=Boyd |accessdate=October 15, 2014 |work=[[Scientific American]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaii is attractive to researchers and seed companies because of its moderate year-round climate—an average of {{convert|75|F}}, which allows 3 or more harvests per year, greatly reducing the length of time required to develop a new seed.&lt;ref name=sa08/&gt;

The main companies working with genetically modified crops in Hawaii are [[Monsanto]], [[Syngenta]], [[Pioneer Hi-Bred]], [[BASF]], [[Mycogen Seeds]] and Agrigentics.{{Citation needed|reason=Companies listed seem to make sense, but make sure list is up-to-date |date=January 2017}}

Gene manipulation is generally conducted elsewhere. Hawaii sites cross the engineered strains with other strains to eliminate undesirable traits and cultivate the hybrids to produce seeds that are then planted elsewhere.
{{toclimit|3}}

== History ==

In the 1960s James Brewbaker, a recently arrived researcher at the University of Hawaii, noticed he could plant three crops a year in Hawaii's warm climate instead of one as on the mainland.&lt;ref name=ap14/&gt;

Seed companies began operating in Hawaii soon after, decades before genetic engineering was possible. Some 90 percent of U.S. corn strains were partially developed in Hawaii.&lt;ref name=ap14/&gt;  DuPont subsidiary Pioneer Hi-Bred International began producing GM corn and soy in Hawaii in the mid-1990s, when the FDA approved the crops for commercial sale.&lt;ref name=sa08/&gt;

As of 2008, Hawaii had been the site of more than 2,230 field trials of genetically modified (GM) crops, including [[corn]], [[soybeans]], [[cotton]], [[potatoes]], [[wheat]], [[alfalfa]], [[beets]], [[rice]], [[safflower]] and [[sorghum]].&lt;ref name=sa08/&gt; This rose to 3,236 as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.isb.vt.edu/release-summary-data.aspx|title = Release Summary Data and Charts(1987-Present)|date = October 22, 2014|accessdate = October 22, 2014|website = |publisher = Information Systems for Biotechnology|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conventional agriculture ==

In 2008, Hawaii farmers produced 1.67 million tons of raw [[sugar]], nearly one million tons less than a decade earlier; only {{convert|13900|acre}} were planted in [[pineapple]]s in 2006 [the latest year for which pineapple statistics are available) compared with 76,700 acres in 1991.&lt;ref name=sa08/&gt;

Other major crops include flowers and nursery plants, [[macadamia nut]]s, [[coffee]], [[milk]], [[algae]], [[tomatoes]], [[banana]]s and [[papaya]]s.&lt;ref name=sa08/&gt;

== Genetically modified agriculture ==

In 2008 Some {{convert|4800|acre}} were dedicated to GM crops across the state, of which 3,500 were corn and soybean seed crops, 1,000 acres papaya, and the remainder field trials for GM crops.&lt;ref name=sa08/&gt; As of 2013 this had increased to {{convert|25000|acre}} of the state's 280,000 acres of agricultural land, on the islands of [[Kauai]], [[Oahu]], [[Maui]] and [[Molokai]]. Nearly fifty percent of the total (11,000 acres) is on Kauai.&lt;ref name=ny1310/&gt;

Seeds yielded $264 million in 2012, supporting 1,400 workers. Seeds exceeded the value of the state's next several largest crops combined—including sugarcane and macadamia nuts.&lt;ref name=ny1310&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/business/fight-over-genetically-altered-crops-flares-in-hawaii.html?pagewanted=all |title=Unease in Hawaii’s Cornfields |first=ANDREW |last=POLLACK
| date=October 7, 2013 |accessdate=October 18, 2014 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008 genetically engineered corn seed was the top crop by value in Hawaii. It made up 92 percent of the state's GM seed industry.

=== Seed crops ===

Seeds containing government-approved modifications are grown in the islands to evaluate how they perform in the field, to be crossed with unmodified strains to further improve the strain and to produce seed for sale. Cultivating corn seed involves having workers place paper bags over the tassels to catch [[pollen]] for use in hand pollinating other plots. At Syngenta plants are individually [[barcode]]d, then [[paper punch]]es are used to take leaf cuttings that are freeze dried and genetically analyzed in North Carolina. The analysis indicates whether each plant has the desired suite of traits. Undesirable plants are uprooted and the rest cultivated through another cycle.&lt;ref name=cp1409/&gt;

Successful strains are then planted in places such as Missouri, Manitoba, Canada and Mexico to make sure the corn is able to thrive in varied situations before they are marketed.&lt;ref name=ap14/&gt;

Developing a new seed variety takes 10–12 growth cycles or 3–7 years, a fraction of the 13 years on the mainland.&lt;ref name=ap14/&gt;&lt;ref name=ny1310/&gt;

=== Papaya ===

An outbreak of [[papaya ringspot virus]] in the mid-'90s decimated Hawaii's papaya trees. GM papaya, endowed with a gene from the [[virus]], immunized the tree. Both Japanese and American regulators approved the modified papaya. It subsequently reduced the use of pesticides that growers had used to control the virus-carrying [[aphid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Heu R.A.|author2=Nagata N.M. |author3=Fukada M.T. |author4=Yonahara B.Y. |date=May 2002|title=Papaya Ringspot Virus Established on Maui|url=http://hdoa.hawaii.gov/pi/files/2013/01/npa02-03_prvmaui.pdf|publisher=Hawaii Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Hawaii Island had around 200 papaya farmers. Papayas were the US' only commercial GM fruit and accounted for three-quarters of the island's 30 million pound harvest. GM papaya was developed primarily by academic scientists. Its lead developer was Hawaii-born [[Dennis Gonsalves]]. He and his team were awarded the 2002 [[Humboldt Prize]] for the most significant contribution to US agriculture in five years.&lt;ref name=nyt1405/&gt;

GM papaya is largely self-pollinating. If planted about 12 or more feet away from other varieties, little cross-pollination occurs.&lt;ref name=nyt1405/&gt;

Critic [[Jeffrey M. Smith|Jeffrey Smith]] claimed that it could harm people because of the protein produced by the new gene and that no studies had been conducted. Gonsalves claimed that ringspot-infected papaya contained that same protein and that people had been eating infected papaya for decades with no ill effects.&lt;ref name=nyt1405/&gt;

One night in July 2011 thousands of papaya trees were destroyed on 10 acres of Hawaii Island farmland. Some farmers and Kevin Richards, director of regulatory relations for the [[American Farm Bureau Federation]], called the attack an act of [[eco-terrorism]].&lt;ref name=ap1108&gt;{{cite news |title=Hawaii’s genetically modified papayas attacked |url=http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/552670/Hawaii-s-genetically-m

== Research activities ==

=== University of Hawaii ===
The [[University of Hawaii]] has conducted research on disease-resistant bananas, a new variety of papaya, Spanish lime,&lt;ref name="sa08" /&gt; the potential of gene flow between cotton strains, animal genomes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/site/ProjectHatch.aspx |title=Hatch Act Formula Grant |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Acacia]] [[koa]].&lt;ref name="ctarh1" /&gt;

In 2012 Monsanto donated $600,000 for student scholarships to the University's [[College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources]], an amount that the college claimed represented about 1 percent of its budget.&lt;ref name=nyt1405/&gt; In 2014, The Monsanto Fellowship Awards award CTARH 120,000.&lt;ref name=ctarh1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/site/ProjectEx.aspx |title=Extramural Grant Projects |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water efficient maize for Africa ===
This public-private humanitarian project is led by African Agricultural Technology Foundation, a Kenyan [[non-governmental organization]]. It is funded by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]. It combines conventional breeding and genetic engineering.Monsanto donated its genetic engineering technology and Maui-grown seeds with insect and drought tolerance traits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Gates and Buffett Foundation Projects in Africa Have Hawai'i Connections|last = Staff|first = |date = October 30, 2014|work = Maui Weekly|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improved maize for African soils ===
This humanitarian effort is led by the [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] in Mexico, funded by the Gates foundation and the [[US Agency for International Development]]. Pioneer donates testing and breeding resources from Kauai. The project is developing nitrogen-efficient hybrids that can improve yields on African soils. The product will be made available royalty-free to seed companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Concerns ==

Since their inception genetically engineered crops have been subject to a variety of concerns, which in some jurisdictions led to restrictions on research, cultivation and/or consumption.

=== Resistance ===

As with any pesticide use, pests can become resistant to those used with (or incorporated into) GM crops.

For example, Bt corn incorporates the insecticidal ''cry'' genes from the ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' [[bacteria]]. Organic farmers have long used the bacteria as an insecticide. If insects become resistant, organic farmers will have to look elsewhere. "One of the biggest concerns with growing crops like Bt corn is that you're putting insects under the greatest selection pressure to become resistant to Bt", according to Bill Freese of the [[Center For Food Safety]].&lt;ref name=sa08/&gt;

=== Gene flow ===

[[Gene flow]] occurs when genes migrate from one strain to another by unintended pollination. Organic farmers continue to grow conventional (non-GM) papayas in Hawaii. Organic farmers and environmental organizations in Hawaii have expressed concern that crops grown from ostensibly non-GM seeds may test positive for modifications. This concern led South Korea to stop buying papayas from Hawaii Island and led Japan to require organic papaya farmers to test their crops.&lt;ref name=sa08/&gt;

=== Labeling ===

The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] does not require GM foods to be labeled, instead claiming that GM crops are as safe as crops developed by conventional breeding.

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] certifies new GM products as safe for consumers and the environment. The European Union's 27 member states then individually decide whether to accept the certification. Genetically modified foods must be labeled. As of 2008 Bt corn had been approved to grow in Spain, Germany, the Czech Republic and Portugal.&lt;ref name=sa08/&gt;

The seed companies conduct the safety tests for new GM food products, reporting safety and nutritional information to the FDA for its evaluation.&lt;ref name=sa08/&gt;

=== Agricultural chemicals ===

From 2006 to 2008, students and teachers at Kauai's Waimea Canyon Middle School, which is near a Syngenta field, repeatedly complained of noxious odors. At one point, the buildings were evacuated and "some kids went to the hospital". Some doctors found unusually high rates of asthma, cancer and birth defects there.&lt;ref name=ny1310/&gt;

A state report found that cancer incidence on Kauai, including the region around the school, was generally the same or lower than the state as a whole. Another study, paid for by the state and county, claimed that the odors were from [[stinkweed]].&lt;ref name=ny1310/&gt;

Voluntary reporting by the companies showed substantial use of [[chlorpyrifos]],&lt;ref name=cp1409&gt;{{cite news |title=GMOs face the test in Hawaii |first=Dan |last=Wheat |publisher=Capital Press |date=September 18, 2014 |accessdate=October 18, 2014 |url=http://www.capitalpress.com/Research/20140918/gmos-face-the-test-in-hawaii}}&lt;/ref&gt; which at sufficient doses can have neurological impacts on children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.11.026 |title=The developmental neurotoxicity of organophosphorus insecticides: A direct role for the oxon metabolites|first=John |last=Flaskos |journal=Toxicology Letters|volume=209 |issue=1 |date= February 25, 2012 |pp=86–93 |pmid=22155227}}&lt;!--|accessdate=October 20, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

"Use of conventional pesticides recommended for control of the [[European corn borer]] has dropped by about one-third since Bt corn was introduced,” according to the US [[Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref name=cp1409/&gt;

=== Toxicity ===

Pioneer Hi-Bred claimed that since 1996 "over a trillion meals containing biotech ingredients have been consumed in the U.S. with no documented negative health impacts."&lt;ref name=sa08/&gt;

=== Culture ===
Cultural practitioners claimed that GMOs were not part of traditional Hawaiian agriculture and did not belong in Hawaii. &lt;!-- haven't found a reliable source with details for this. still looking. --&gt;

== Local government action ==

Three of Hawaii's four counties have adopted or considered local regulation of pesticides, GMOs or both.

=== Kauai ===

The [[Kauai]] County Council passed a law in 2013, over the mayor's veto, to require large farms to create 500 foot buffer zones around their fields and to disclose the pesticides that they use. Seed companies Syngenta, Pioneer, BASF and Agrigentics sued to stop the law, claiming that state and federal regulations were adequate.&lt;ref name=ap14&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/hawaii-genetically-engineered-crop-flash-point |title=Hawaii is genetically engineered crop flash point |first=AUDREY |last=McAVOY |date= April 19, 2014 |accessdate=October 15, 2014 |publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 US [[District Court of Hawaii]] judge Barry Kurren overturned the law, finding for the [[plaintiff]]s. The judge found that "the Ordinance is pre-empted by state law and is therefore invalid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-judge-overturns-gmo-crop-curbs-in-hawaii-1409009260 |title=U.S. Judge Overturns GMO Crop Curbs in Hawaii |first=JACOB BUNGE |last=CONNECT
| date=August 25, 2014 |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After it was overturned, Syngenta claimed that it had been voluntarily notifying nearby schools and residences one week before any pesticide applications and that while the law required 500 feet buffers, the company had not farmed within 1,500 feet of any dwelling for years.&lt;ref name=cp1409/&gt;

=== Hawaii Island ===

In November 2008 the Hawaii County Council (county legislature) voted to ban the growth of GM [[taro]] (a Hawaiian staple) and coffee to prevent GM crop pollen from reaching other strains.&lt;ref name=ap14/&gt;

In 2013 a second bill banned the cultivation of any GM crop on the island, grandfathering in papaya and corn planted by a dairy to feed its cows. Field tests to study new GM crops were prohibited. Penalties were set at $1,000 per day.&lt;ref name=nyt1405&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/us/on-hawaii-a-lonely-quest-for-facts-about-gmos.html |title=A Lonely Quest for Facts on Genetically Modified Crops |first=AMY |last=HARMON |date=January 4, 2014 |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maui ===

In 2014, 9,000 Maui citizens signed a petition sponsored by the SHAKA Movement calling for a moratorium on GMO production and research. The initiative specified penalties including fines and jail for knowing violations and did not limit its scope to commercial agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shakamovement.org/law |title=A BILL PLACING A MORATORIUM ON THE CULTIVATION OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED ORGANISMS |publisher=SHAKA Movement |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hnn1410&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/26731381/voters-to-decide-on-maui-gmo-debate-in-one-month|title=Voters to decide on Maui GMO debate in one month |date=October 7, 2014 |accessdate=October 18, 2014 |work=Hawaii News Now |first=Tannya |last=Joaquin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was to be voted on in the November 2014 election. {{Citation needed|reason=Need to verify the date|date=January 2017}}

Proponents claimed that the moratorium would affect only 2% of the island's agricultural acreage and 1% of existing farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GMO Opponents Weigh In at SHAKA Movement Presentation |date=October 14, 2014 |first1=Liz |last1=O’Garvey |first2=Jay |last2=Greathouse |url= http://www.mauiweekly.com/page/content.detail/id/532929/GMO-Opponents-Weigh-In-at-SHAKA-Movement-Presentation.html?nav=13#sthash.vrA4fEhY.dpuf |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponent Ashley Lukens, Hawaii Center for Food Safety Director said, "Hawaii hosts more genetic engineering test sites than any other state. We had 1,124 field tests last year. California had 184."&lt;ref name=hnn1410/&gt;

Opposing group Citizens Against the Maui County Farming Ban Initiative claimed that the measure was 'anti-farming' and would cost the county 600 jobs. Other opponents including former State Attorney General Michael Lilly and Mayor [[Alan Arakawa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mauiweekly.com/page/content.detail/id/532928/Maui-County-Mayoral-Candidates-Talk-About-the-Issues.html?nav=13 |title= Maui County Mayoral Candidates Talk About the Issues: Maui economy and GMOs rank as top concerns |date=October 14, 2014 |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who claimed that the initiative was poorly drafted.&lt;ref name=hnn1410/&gt; Mycogen employee Adolph Helm was claimed by a moratorium proponent to be the leader of the opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-henry-fox/gmos-are-traditional-and-_b_5937920.html |title=GMOs Attack!

==== Aftermath ====
The initiative passed on November 4 by about 50.2 to 47.9 percent, with the remaining ballots left blank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://mauinow.com/2014/11/05/monsanto-to-file-lawsuit-challenging-maui-gmo-moratorium/|title = Monsanto to File Lawsuit Challenging Maui GMO Moratorium|last = Wendy|first = Osher|date = November 5, 2014|work = Mauinow.com|accessdate = November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Kurren said Maui County may not implement until he considers arguments in a lawsuit against the measure. Both sides have agreed to delay the date the law goes into effect. Monsanto Co. and a unit of Dow Chemical Co. sued the county to stop the law. Company employees and Maui County businesses joined the lawsuit. The suit claimed that the law would harm the economy and their businesses, citing the Kauai County case. They continued that the state, and not the county, has jurisdiction. The county and the plaintiffs must provide arguments for their position by December 1. Initiative supporters filed a separate suit in state court, attempting to compel the county to implement the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/592066/Judge--GMO-moratorium-on-hold-as-review-done.html?nav=10|title = Judge: GMO moratorium on hold as review done|last = The Associated Press and Maui News staff|first = |date = November 15, 2014|work = Maui News|accessdate = November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next sections summarize the initiative.

==== Findings ====

GM agriculture threatens Hawaiian culture, the rest of Maui agriculture, human health and the environment. The detailed claims were:

* Commercial GM agriculture is growing rapidly and existing regulation is inadequate. 
* Maui citizens have the right to suspend GM agriculture. 
* GMOs are not native to Maui County and instead are possibly invasive species. The right to exclude GMOs is supported by the Hawaiian Public Trust Doctrine, the Hawaii State Constitution and other State and County environmental laws.
* Genetic engineering is imprecise, with unpredictable, uncontrollable results that produce unintended consequences. Mixing plant, animal, bacterial and viral genes is highly risky.
* The majority of GM crops are engineered for herbicide-resistance (93% of 2013 US soy), promoting indiscriminate use. Such crops have added 527 million pounds of herbicides to US farmland. These herbicides damage soil, harm wildlife, contaminate drinking water and risk consumer and farm worker health.
* GMO-driven herbicide overuse produced resistant "superweeds" that force farmers to use increasingly toxic and expensive herbicides.
* GMO-driven insecticide use risks producing resistant "superbugs" that force conventional and organic farmers to use more and/or stronger insecticides.
* Some GMO farmers simultaneously or in quick succession apply multiple pesticides, often on test crops, possibly creating unknown compounds. Testing and regulation of such  combinations is inadequate, specifically in animal or human studies.
* Existing county, state and federal oversight is inadequate.
* The Hawaii Department of Agriculture's regulatory structure is inadequate to monitor GMOs or to aid in citizens' understanding of their impacts. These impacts have not been properly or independently evaluated.
* Organic farming is a rapidly expanding sector of Maui's agricultural economy.
* Protecting land and water is crucial to the success of tourism, the County's largest employer.
* Preserving the identity, quality and reliability of the County's agricultural products is critical to its economic well-being.
* Many foreign markets prohibit GMOs and a single instance of an accidental GM hybrid in a conventional or organic crop resulted in buyer rejection.
* Accidental cross-pollination, co-mingling of conventional and GM seeds and transfer by animals or weather events puts GM crops where they are not intended. More than 50% of Hawaii County conventional papaya have become pollinated by GM papaya.
* Those who lose acceptance as conventional and/or organic suppliers as a result of such accidents lack adequate legal recourse.
* No proven procedures exist to eliminate GMOs from an area once they have escaped their intended environment.
* GMOs in Maui County primarily involve seed and test crops that include repeated use of pesticides, risking significant harm to soil resources. Soil microbes are harmed by such pesticides.
* The County's groundwater is significantly contaminated with pesticides, including [[DBCP]] and [[1,2,3-Trichloropropane|TCP]], from prior pineapple crops. GMO production adds to the problem.
* Pesticides are applied to fallow GM fields, adding to the problem of pesticide runoff, which harm ground and surface water, beaches and reefs.
* Wind-blown pesticide residues risk significant harm to air resources, farm workers and downwind residents.

==== Rights and authority ====

The initiative claimed that localities have the right to regulate GM crops because:

*  Hawaii Revised Statutes, Section 46-1.5(13) grants counties the right to pass ordinances to protect health, life, property and preserve order as long as such ordinances comply with any applicable state statue. 
* Hawaii Constitution Article XI, Section 1 grants political subdivisions the right to uphold the Public Trust Doctrine, and grants all persons legal standing to enforce such rights.
* Hawaii State Constitution, Article XI, Section 9 grants each person the right to a clean and healthful environment and grants any person standing to enforce this right through the courts.
* Hawaii State Constitution, Article XI, Section 1 compels political subdivisions to conserve and protect Hawaii's natural beauty and natural resources in furtherance of the State's self-sufficiency.
* The [[US Supreme Court]] held in [[Maine v. Taylor]], 477 U.S. 131 (1986) that the [[US Constitution]]'s [[Commerce Clause]] did not preempt states and localities from protecting health and safety and natural resources or force them to wait for scientific consensus or potentially irreversible environmental damage occurs before acting. Taking action absent such consensus is known as the [[precautionary principle]].
* The County initiative process allows citizens to enact such protective ordinances.

==== Purposes ====

The stated purposes of the ordinance are to:
* protect against the spread of GMOs outside of their intended areas
* defend organic and conventional crops 
* protect against hazardous practices including pesticides
* preserve citizens' right to reject GMOs for health, moral or other reasons; 
* preserve the environment and Public Trust resources, while promoting Maui's cultural heritage and traditional Hawaiian agriculture.

==== Moratorium ====

The moratorium ordinance prohibits propagating, cultivating or testing GMOs within the County.

The moratorium does not apply to: GMO crops in mid-growth cycle when the moratorium is enacted, GM products that have been incorporated into food or medicine already prepared for consumption; licensed health practitioners whose practice employs GMOs; and non-commercial research conducted under enclosed indoor laboratory conditions by accredited colleges or universities.

The moratorium is lifted once an Environmental and Public Health Impacts Study (EPHIS) approved by 6 of the 9 Council members and a public hearing is completed. The Council must further determine that the GMOs provide health benefits and protect the County's natural beauty and natural resources.

The initiative does not include specific restrictions on GM agriculture following the end of the moratorium.

====  Environmental and Public Health Impacts Study (EPHIS) ====

Lifting the moratorium requires an Environmental and Public Health Impacts Study (EPHIS) conducted by the County through a two-phase, community-based process. The EPHIS must be funded by private entities.

Within ninety days of receiving such funding, the Council is to create a Joint Fact Finding Group (JFFG) of scientists and health experts with no GM industry ties, facilitated by a professional consultant, to design the study. The JFFG shall notify the community and allow a thirty-day public input period. The final scope, design, results and raw data must be published on the County's website. The study's minimum scope includes the potential for:

* GMO release beyond GM operational boundaries
* Recall of released GMOs
* Pesticides used singly and in combination to harm groundwater, surface water, oceans and reefs
* Pesticide-laden air and dust to harm people and the environment;
* Untested pesticide combinations that may be harmful to people and the environment;
* Gene transfer from GMOs to other species 
* Birth defects arising from proximity to GM operations in Maui County or Kauai County

The EPHIS must be conducted by a non-biased, professional consultant independent of GE industry ties overseen by the JFFG and completed within eighteen months of the publication of the study's final scope and design. The process includes a ninety-day public comment period with four public hearings, including one on Molokai. The study must address relevant information, data, comments and public concerns. The study may recommend actions for the County to address significant effects on the environment, Public Trust Resources and public health. The final results and all raw data must be published on the County's website.

==== Enforcement ====

The County may implement regulations to manage the moratorium, but the regulations may not create any exemptions from the ordinance.

The County may seek a court order to enjoin any person or entity from violating the ordinance.

Civil penalties are:
* $10,000.00 dollars for a first violation
* $25,000.00 dollars for a second violation
* $50,000.00 dollars for each subsequent violation

Each day of violation is considered a separate violation.

Criminal penalties are in addition to civil penalties. Violations are misdemeanors punishable by a fine of up to $2,000, or imprisonment for up to one year, or both, for each offense. Each additional post-conviction day of violation constitutes an additional offense. In addition, 60 days after a notification of noncompliance, the County may enter the property and remove infringing crops at the violator's expense.

Sixty days after notifying the County and the alleged violator, any injured citizen may seek an injunction against the violation. The court may award the plaintiff reasonable costs and attorney fees, but not punitive damages.

Michaloliakos began the foundations of what would become Golden Dawn in 1980, when he published the first issue of the right-wing, pro-military junta journal with that name. In this context, Golden Dawn had its origins in the movement that worked towards a return to right-wing military dictatorship in Greece.

Following an investigation into the [[Murder of Pavlos Fyssas|murder of anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas]] in September 2013 by a supporter of the party,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greek-anti-fascist-rapper-murdered-by-neo-nazi-golden-dawn-supporter-8824664.html&lt;/ref&gt; Michaloliakos and several other Golden Dawn MPs and members were arrested and held in [[Remand (detention)|pre-trial detention]] on suspicion of forming a criminal organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Golden Dawn leader jailed ahead of Greek criminal trial|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/golden-dawn-leader-jailed-nikos-michaloliakos|accessdate=2 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began on 20 April 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Golden Dawn leaders' trial adjourned until next week|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/07/golden-dawn-leaders-resume-trial-greece|website = The Guardian|accessdate = 17 June 2015|first = Helena|last = Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is ongoing as of 2018.

==Program==
Golden Dawn first received widespread attention in 1991, and in 1993 registered as a political party. By this time Golden Dawn had adopted several southern Balkan focused regional objectives as its main programme: to promote the idea of a [[Megali Idea|Greater Greece]] through the expansion of Greek territory into southern Albania ([[Northern Epirus]]), the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and southern Bulgaria, and ultimately Greece's reconquest of [[Constantinople]] (modern day [[Istanbul]]) and western Anatolia through war with Turkey. They also called to push for the complete [[Hellenisation]] of [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace]] through the expulsion of [[Northern Greece|Northern Greece's]] last remaining [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|Macedonian-speaking minority]] (or so-called Slavophone Greeks) and the [[Turks of Western Thrace|Turkish-speaking Muslim minority]] of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]] that were settled during the Ottoman period (see [[Western Thrace Turks]]). They also aspire "to combat Islam in the region", such as through contributing fighters to the [[Greek Volunteer Guard]] that helped capture [[Srebrenica]].&lt;ref&gt;See Golden Dawn journal, summer 1995 issue, for a manifesto of this program.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-2000s, Golden Dawn had redirected its attention to opposing non-European, and particularly Muslim, [[European migrant crisis|immigration]] into the mainly Greek areas of southern Greece and Athens. Golden Dawn had temporarily ceased political operations in 2005 and was absorbed by the [[Patriotic Alliance (Greece)|Patriotic Alliance]]. The Alliance, in turn, ceased operations after Michaloliakos withdrew support in the spring of 2007. Golden Dawn held its sixth congress, in March 2007, where party officials announced the resumption of political activities. At [[Greek local elections, 2010|local elections]] on 7 November 2010 Golden Dawn got 5.3% of the vote in the municipality of Athens, winning a seat at the City Council. In some neighbourhoods with large immigrant communities it reached 20%.&lt;ref name="NYCtimes"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kitsantonis |first1=Niki |date=1 December 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/world/europe/01greece.html|title=Attacks on Immigrants on the Rise in Greece |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=27 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party ran a campaign during the [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|May 2012 Greek national elections]] based on concerns about unemployment, [[austerity]], the economy, and immigration, which gained a large increase in support from the Greek electorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/05/201257123259482708.html |title=Q&amp;A: Greece's Golden Dawn |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |last1=Sportiche |first1=Sophie |date=7 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It received 7% of the popular vote, enough for the party to enter the [[Hellenic Parliament]] for the first time with 21 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Rob |last1=Cooper |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2140686/Greek-elections-2012-Neo-Nazi-party-Golden-Dawn-want-force-immigrants-work-camps.html |title=Rise of the Greek neo-Nazis: Ultra-right party Golden Dawn wants to force immigrants into work camps and plant landmines along Turkish border |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=7 May 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a [[Greek legislative election, June 2012|second election in June 2012]], this was reduced to 18 seats.

===National Plan===
In 2015, Golden Dawn outlined their 'National Plan' for Greece's recovery from the [[Greek government-debt crisis|financial crisis]] as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Χρυσή Αυγή – Eθνικό Σχέδιο – Για μια Eλεύθερη και Ισχυρή Ελλάδα|url=http://www.xryshaygh.com/assets/files/xa_ethniko_sxedio.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1980–2005===
[[File:HA1cover.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Cover of the first issue of ''Chrysi Avgi'' magazine, December 1980]]
In December 1980, [[Nikolaos Michaloliakos]] and a group of supporters launched ''Chrysi Avgi'' magazine. Michaloliakos had been active in [[far-right politics]] for many years, having been arrested several times for politically motivated offences, such as beatings and illegal possession of explosive materials, which led to his discharge from the military.&lt;ref name="IosHist"&gt;[http://www.hri.org/E/1998/98-07-02.dir/keimena/greece/greece2.htm Γράφει ο ΙΟΣ] ''[[Eleftherotypia]]'' 2 July 1998 (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vima"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nedos |first=Vasilis |date=11 September 2005 |title=Το κλούβιο "αβγό του φιδιού" |trans-title=The rotten "egg of the snake" |url=http://www.tovima.gr/relatedarticles/article/?aid=168197&amp;dt=11/09/2005 |language=Greek |newspaper=To Vima |location=Athens |access-date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michaloliakos"&gt;[http://www.ethniko.net/ironyouth/michaloliakos.htm Article about Michaloliakos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002204407/http://www.ethniko.net/ironyouth/michaloliakos.htm |date=2 October 2013 }} published on Golden Dawn's website.&lt;/ref&gt; While he was in prison, Michaloliakos met the leaders of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]] and laid the foundations of the Golden Dawn party.&lt;ref name="Vima" /&gt; According to the newspaper ''[[Eleftherotypia]]'' the characteristics of the magazine and the organisation were clearly [[Nazism|National Socialist]].&lt;ref name="IosHist" /&gt; ''Chrysi Avgi'' magazine ceased publication in April 1984, when Michaloliakos joined the [[National Political Union (Greece)|National Political Union]] and took over the leadership of its youth section.&lt;ref name="Vima" /&gt; In January 1985, he broke away from the National Political Union and founded the Popular National Movement – Golden Dawn, which was officially recognised as a political party in 1993.&lt;ref name="Vima" /&gt;

Golden Dawn remained largely on the margins of far-right politics until the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] in 1991 and 1992.&lt;ref name="IosHist"/&gt; The Greek newspaper ''[[Eleftherotypia]]'' reported that on 10 October 1992, about 30 Golden Dawn members attacked students at the [[Athens University of Economics and Business]] during a massive demonstration against the [[Macedonia naming dispute|use of the name ''Macedonia'']] by the [[Republic of Macedonia]].&lt;ref name="IosASOEE"&gt;[http://www.iospress.gr/ios1998/ios19980927b.htm ΣΧΕΣΕΙΣ ΑΚΡΟΔΕΞΙΑΣ-ΕΛ.ΑΣ]. [[Eleftherotypia]]. 27 September 1998 (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, the first far-right [[street gang]]s appeared under the leadership of Giannis Giannopoulos, a former military officer who was involved with the South African [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] (AWB) during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="IosHist" /&gt; After the events of 1991 and 1992, Golden Dawn had gained a stable membership of more than 200 members, and Giannopoulos rose within the party hierarchy.&lt;ref name="IosHist" /&gt; Golden Dawn ran in the [[European Parliament election, 1994 (Greece)|1994 European Parliament election]], gaining 7,264 votes nationwide; 0.1% of the votes cast.&lt;ref name="NIGMA"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nygma.gr/mag/articles/Article.asp?ar_id=718 |title=Χρυσή Αυγή: Η Άρια φυλή της Ελλάδας | date=10 June 2005 |work=Nigma Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s the party embraced [[Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism|Hellenic Neopagan]] beliefs, praised the [[Twelve Olympians]] and described [[Marxism]] and liberalism as "the ideological carriers of [[Judeo-Christian]]ity".&lt;ref name="ReligionXA"&gt;

A number of Golden Dawn members participated during the [[Bosnian War]] in the [[Greek Volunteer Guard]] (GVG), which was part of the Drina Corps of the [[Army of Republika Srpska]]. A few GVG volunteers were present in [[Srebrenica]] during the [[Srebrenica massacre#Non-Serb participants in the killings|Srebrenica massacre]], and they raised a [[Flag of Greece|Greek flag]] at a ruined church after the fall of the town.&lt;ref name="Michas"&gt;Michas, Takis;"Unholy Alliance", [[Texas A&amp;M University]] Press: Eastern European Studies (College Station, Tex.) pp. 22 [http://www.preventgenocide.org/edu/pastgenocides/formeryugoslavia/resources/]&lt;/ref&gt; Spiros Tzanopoulos, a GVG sergeant who took part in the attack against Srebrenica, said many of the Greek volunteers participated in the war because they were members of Golden Dawn.&lt;ref name="srebr"&gt;[http://www.enet.gr/online/online_fpage_text?id=13996864,21821632,8195520%22 Για τη Λευκή Φυλή και την Ορθοδοξία] Eleftherotypia 16 July 2005 (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; Golden Dawn members in the GVG were decorated by [[Radovan Karadžić]], but, according to Charis Kousoumvris, a former member of Golden Dawn, those who were decorated, later left the party.&lt;ref name="srebr"/&gt;

In April 1996, Giannopoulos represented the party at a pan-European convention of far-right nationalist parties in Moscow, where he presented a bust of [[Alexander the Great]] to [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]] leader [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]] for his birthday.&lt;ref name="IosHist" /&gt; Golden Dawn participated in the [[Greek legislative election, 1996|1996 legislative election]] in September, receiving 4,487 votes nationwide; 0.07% of the votes cast.&lt;ref name="1996elections"&gt;[http://www.ypes.gr/ekloges/content/gr/ethnik_fr.htm Results] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212002453/http://www.ypes.gr/ekloges/content/gr/ethnik_fr.htm |date=12 December 2006 }}  of the 1996 legislative election.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1997, Giannopoulos published an article in ''Chrysi Avgi'' magazine calling for nationalist [[Vigilante|vigilantism]] against immigrants and liberals.&lt;ref name="IosGiannopoulos"&gt;1998 article in [[Eleftherotypia]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, a prominent party member, Antonios Androutsopoulos, assaulted Dimitris Kousouris, a left-wing student activist. The resulting media attention, along with internal party conflicts (due to poor results in the 1996 elections), led some of its most extreme members to gradually fade from official party affairs.&lt;ref name="IosHist" /&gt;

Androutsopoulos finally surrendered in 2005 and was convicted of the attempted murder of Kousouris and another two left-wing activists, for which he received a 21-year prison term. The rest of the members of the squad that hit Kousouris were never legally prosecuted. In March 2009, Androutsopoulos appealed his sentence and received 12 years, to be finally released from prison a few months later. Meanwhile, Golden Dawn continued to hold rallies and marches, and it ran in the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (Greece)|1999 European election]] in an alliance with the [[Front Line (political party)|Front Line]] party, gaining 48,532 votes nationwide; 0.75% of the votes cast.&lt;ref name="IosHist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HAelections"&gt;[http://www.hri.org/MPA/gr/other/elections99/other_parties.html "Ta alla Kommata"], [[Macedonian Press Agency]] information on the 1999 elections.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''Eleftherotypia'' reported that Golden Dawn members distributed [[homophobia|homophobic]] [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]] during the first [[pride parade]] held in Athens.&lt;ref name="gayParade2006"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ioannas |last=Sotirchou |url=http://www.enet.gr/online/online_text?c=112&amp;id=61462048 |title=Φτάνει πια ο εξευτελισμός |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422214438/http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text?c=112&amp;id=61462048 |archivedate=22 April 2009 |date=27 June 2005 |work=[[Eleftherotypia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Golden Dawn's leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, the party suspended its own autonomous political activities after 1 December 2005 because of clashes with [[anarchism|anarchists]].&lt;ref name="Ingr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.in.gr/news/article.asp?lngEntityID=667563&amp;lngDtrID=244 |script-title=el:Αναστέλλεται η λειτουργία της ακροδεξιάς οργάνωσης "Χρυσή Αυγή" |work=in.gr |date=1 December 2005 |language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golden Dawn members were instructed to continue their activism within the [[Patriotic Alliance (Greece)|Patriotic Alliance]] party, which was very closely linked to Golden Dawn.&lt;ref name="ENF_disbandment"&gt;[http://www.europeannationalfront.org/?p=21#more-21 ''Golden Dawn stops their activities''], European National Front website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HApatris"&gt;[http://www.symmaxia.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=1 Article in the website of Patriotic Alliance], stating that "those who contributed mostly in our political campaign were the youth of Golden Dawn".&lt;/ref&gt; The former leader of Patriotic Alliance, Dimitrios Zaphiropoulos, was once a member of Golden Dawn's political council, and Michaloliakos became a leading member of Patriotic Alliance.&lt;ref name="Vima"/&gt; There were accusations that the "Patriotic Alliance" was simply the new name of Golden Dawn.&lt;ref name="HApatrisIos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iospress.gr/mikro2006/mikro20060513.htm |script-title=el:Το δίκροκο αβγό του φιδιού |work=Eleftherotypia |language=Greek |accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities by Patriotic Alliance's members were often attributed to Golden Dawn (even by themselves), creating confusion.&lt;ref name="HApatris" /&gt; This is the main reason Golden Dawn's members announced the withdrawal of their support of the Patriotic Alliance, which eventually led to the interruption of Golden Dawn's political activities.&lt;ref name="PATRISdisbandment"&gt;[http://www.xrushaugh.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=210&amp;Itemid=31 Golden Dawn announces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101307/http://www.xrushaugh.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=210&amp;Itemid=31 |date=28 September 2007 }} the withdrawal of their support to Patriotic Alliance.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndymediaPATRIS"&gt;[http://athens.indymedia.org/front.php3?lang=el&amp;article_id=637975 News of the disbandment of Patriotic Alliance], in [[Independent Media Center]].&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, Golden Dawn held its sixth congress and announced the resumption of their political and ideological activism.&lt;ref name="mun.

In 2018, the party attempted to distance itself from fascism and present itself as [[right-wing]] [[souverainism|sovereigntist]], praising Italian Deputy Prime Minister [[Matteo Salvini]] and Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] as inspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[L'espresso]]|title=Ora i neonazisti di Alba Dorata vogliono copiare Matteo Salvini|date=31 July 2018|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/internazionale/2018/07/30/news/ora-i-neonazisti-di-alba-dorata-vogliono-copiare-matteo-salvini-1.325377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Golden Dawn claimed to have local organisations in 32 Greek cities, as well as in [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="HAactivities"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507063216/http://ta-nea.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=A&amp;f=17333&amp;m=N10&amp;aa=1|archivedate=7 May 2005|url=http://ta-nea.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=A&amp;f=17333&amp;m=N10&amp;aa=1|date=11 May 2002|title=Το... αυγό της ελληνικής ακροδεξιάς |first=Costas|last=Hatzidis|publisher=[[Ta Nea]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party created the "Committee of National Memory" (Επιτροπή Εθνικής Μνήμης, ''Epitropí Ethnikís Mnímis''), to organise demonstrations commemorating the anniversaries of certain Greek national events. Since 1996, the Committee of National Memory has organized an annual march, usually on 31 January in [[Athens]], in memory of three Greek officers who died during the [[Imia/Kardak|Imia military crisis]]. According to the [[European National Front]] website, the march in 2006 was attended by 2,500 people, although no neutral sources have confirmed that number.

In September 2005, Golden Dawn attempted to organise a festival called "Eurofest 2005 – Nationalist Summer Camp" at the grounds of a Greek summer camp. The planned festival depended on the participation of the German [[National Democratic Party of Germany]], the Italian [[Forza Nuova]] and the Romanian [[Noua Dreaptă]], as well as Spanish and other European far-right groups, as [[European National Front]]'s festival.

===Youth Front===
Golden Dawn's Youth Front has distributed fliers with nationalist messages in [[Athens]] schools and organised the concert series [[Rock Against Communism]]. It publishes the [[ultranationalist]] magazine ''Resistance Hellas-Antepithesi''. The magazine is a sister publication of the United States-based [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance's]] ''[[Resistance Records|Resistance]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natall.com/adv/2006/03-04-06.html |title=The Growth of White Power Music |publisher=Natall.com |date=4 March 2006 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114125826/http://www.natall.com/adv/2006/03-04-06.html |archivedate=14 November 2006 }}{{third-party-inline|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Football hooliganism===
On 6 October 1999, during a football match between [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and [[Albania national football team|Albania]] in Athens, Albanian supporters burnt a Greek flag in their stand. This act was captured and broadcast extensively by the Greek media, leading to a series of angry reactions by Greek nationalists against foreign immigrants. In a specific case, on the night of 22 October, Pantelis Kazakos, a nationalist and a member of the Golden Dawn,&lt;ref name="rizospasths_dikh_kazakou_xrysh_aygh"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.rizospastis.gr/story.do?id=667315&amp;publDate=16/2/2001|title=Το παραμύθι του "τρελού" και ο "Χρυσαυγίτης"|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=16 February 2001|work=Rizospastis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kathimerini_kazakos_kathighths_symmathhtes_melos_xryshs_ayghs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wwk.kathimerini.gr/kath/edition/1999/23-10-1999.pdf|title=Σφαίρες στη συνείδηση της κοινωνίας|accessdate=13 April 2012|author1=Δώρα Αντωνίου|author2=Απόστολος Λακάσας|author3=Νίκος Μπαρδούνιας|author4=Σπύρος Καραλής|author5=Θανάσης Τσιγγάνας|date=23 October 1999|work=Kathimerini|page=3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114182825/http://wwk.kathimerini.gr/kath/edition/1999/23-10-1999.pdf|archivedate=14 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iospress_dhmografiko_aparxaint_2000"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iospress.gr/ios2000/ios20000102a.htm|title=Το δημογραφικό Απαρτχάιντ του 2000|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=2 January 2000|work=Eleftherotypia}}&lt;/ref&gt; said he felt "insulted by the burning of the Greek flag" and shot and killed two people and wounded seven others in an attack in central Athens. All of the victims were immigrants, and four of the wounded remain paralysed. Other Golden Dawn members, feeling also "insulted by the burning of the Greek flag", formed the [[hooligan firm]] ''Galazia Stratia'' (Greek for "Blue Army"). It has described itself as a "fan club of the Greek national teams" and its goal as "to defend Greek national pride inside the stadiums." It has been reported that following Golden Dawn's official disbandment in 2005, many former party members have put most of their energy into promoting ''Galazia Stratia''.&lt;ref name="Mundohooligans"&gt;[http://www.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,id=95908980 Μουντο-ρατσισμός]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223750/http://www.enet.gr/online/online_text/c%3D112%2Cid%3D95908980 |date=26 September 2007 }} Eleftherotypia 10 September 2006 (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Galazia Stratia'' is closely linked to Golden Dawn, and the two groups shared the same street address.&lt;ref name="NaziHooligan"&gt;[http://www.iospress.gr/mikro2001/mikro20011201.htm Nazis dressed up as fans], ''Eleftherotypia 1 December 2001''&lt;/ref&gt; Golden Dawn made no attempt to deny the connections, openly praising the actions of ''Galazia Stratia'' in its newspaper, and accepting praise in return from the firm.&lt;ref name="GSthanksHA"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505225040/http://www.meandros.net/galazia-stratia/pages/syndesmos.htm|archivedate=5 May 2006|url=http://www.meandros.net/galazia-stratia/pages/syndesmos.htm|title=Συνέντευξη στο περιοδικό ΑΝΤΕΠΙΘΕΣΗ|publisher=Meandros.net|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Galazia Stratia'' and Golden Dawn have been accused of various acts of sports-related violence.&lt;ref name="NaziHooligan"/&gt; In September 2004, after a football match between Greece and Albania in [[Tirana]] (which Greece lost 2–1), Albanian immigrants living in Greece went out on the streets of Athens and other cities to celebrate the victory. Greek hooligans felt provoked by this and violence erupted against Albanian immigrants in various parts of Greece, resulting in the murder of an Albanian in Zakynthos and many others being injured. Golden Dawn and ''Galazia Stratia'' were proven to be directly responsible for many of the attacks. According to ''Eleftherotypia'', ''Galazia Stratia'' members severely assaulted a [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] and a Bangladeshi during celebrations following the success of the [[Greece national basketball team|Greek national basketball team]] at the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]].&lt;ref name="Mundohooligans"/&gt;

===''Periandros'' case===
Antonios Androutsopoulos (aka ''Periandros''), a prominent member of Golden Dawn, was a fugitive from 1998 to 14 September 2005 after being accused of the attempted murder on 16 June 1998 of three left-wing students – including Dimitris Kousouris, who was badly injured.&lt;ref name="TaNea"&gt;{{cite news |first= Areti |last=Athanasiou |url=http://www.tanea.gr/ellada/article/?aid=4332198 |date=17 April 2004 |title=Aστυνομικοί κάλυπταν τον "Περίανδρο" |work=[[Ta Nea]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kathimerini"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100019_14/09/2005_60740 |title=In Brief |work=[[Kathimerini]] |date=14 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807055723/http://archive.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100019_14/09/2005_60740 |archivedate=7 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eleftherotypia"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text?c=112&amp;id=34783000 |title=Ο "Περίανδρος" άδειασε την ΕΛ.ΑΣ. |work=[[Eleftherotypia]] |date=14 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Androutsopoulos had been sentenced [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] to four years of prison for illegal weapon possession while the attempted murder charges against him were still standing.&lt;ref name="Kathimerini2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_786829_27/04/2004_101892 |title=Katadikasthike four years in absentia for attacking student |date=27 April 2004 |work=[[Kathimerini]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035650/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_786829_27/04/2004_101892 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorities' failure to apprehend Androutsopoulos for seven years prompted criticism by the Greek media. An article in ''[[Ta Nea]]'' claimed that Periandros remained in Greece and evaded arrest because of his connections with the police.&lt;ref name="TaNea" /&gt; In an interview in 2004, [[Michalis Chrisochoidis]], the former minister of public order and a member of [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]], claimed that such accusations were unfounded, and he blamed the inefficiency of the Greek police.

===Imia 2008===
On 2 February 2008, Golden Dawn planned to hold the annual march for the twelfth anniversary of the Imia military crisis. Anti-fascist groups organised a protest in order to cancel the march, as a response to racist attacks allegedly caused by Golden Dawn members. Golden Dawn members occupied the square in which the march was to take place, and when anti-fascists showed up, clashes occurred. During the riots that followed, Golden Dawn members were seen attacking the anti-fascists with riot police doing nothing to stop them and actually letting them pass through their lines. This led to two people being stabbed and another two wounded by rocks. There were allegations that Golden Dawn members even carried police equipment with them and that Golden Dawn's equipment was carried inside a police van.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://athens.indymedia.org/front.php3?lang=el&amp;article_id=823380 |title=Detailed update of the Saturday events, in Athens, during the AntiFascistic Demonstration |publisher=Indymedia |date=3 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,id=72703688,94637512,80585800,7746952,15637256,90684776 |title=ΔΕΣΜΟΙ ΑΙΜΑΤΟΣ |first=Giorgis |last=Marnellou |work=Eleftherotypia |date=4 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813012835/http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text/c%3D112%2Cid%3D72703688%2C94637512%2C80585800%2C7746952%2C15637256%2C90684776 |archivedate=13 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bomb attacks on Golden Dawn offices===

On 7 September 1993 a bomb exploded at Golden Dawn's offices. The attack was attributed to the far-left terrorist organization [[Revolutionary People's Struggle|Revolutionary People's Struggle (ELA)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/greek/mpegrb/2003/03-02-03.mpegrb.html|title=Macedonian Press Agency: News in Greek, 03-02-03|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, Golden Dawn's offices were attacked by a group of Anarchists with [[molotov cocktail]]s and stones. There were gunshots, and two people (who claimed that they were just passing by) were injured.&lt;ref name="Ingr20.11" /&gt; According to Golden Dawn, three suspects were arrested and set free.&lt;ref name="XApress" /&gt; During the subsequent police investigation, leftovers from [[molotov cocktail]]s were discovered in Golden Dawn's offices.&lt;ref name="Ingr20.11" /&gt; Golden Dawn has stated that this was the reason for the organisation's disbandment.&lt;ref name="Ingr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ENF_disbandment"/&gt;

On 19 March 2010, a bomb described by police as of "moderate power" was detonated in the fifth floor office of Golden Dawn, in downtown Athens. Twenty-five minutes prior to the blast, an unidentified caller contacted a local newspaper in order to announce the attack. The targeted building and the surrounding area were evacuated in response. The explosion caused substantial property damage but no casualties. The office reopened on 10 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120906015036/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=24&amp;art_id=nw20100319092955696C888964 Neo-Nazi offices in Greece bombed] [[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]], 19 March 2010.

On 4 December 2012, a makeshift bomb containing dynamite exploded at Golden Dawn's office building in [[Aspropyrgos]], a suburb of Athens. The explosion caused significant damage to two floors but produced no casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spilius|first=Alex|title=Golden Dawn offices damaged by bomb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/9721596/Golden-Dawn-offices-damaged-by-bomb.html|accessdate=4 December 2012|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 February 2013 an improvised bomb exploded in the regional office of Golden Dawn in [[Piraeus]]. The explosion and the subsequent fire caused material damage. Next morning a similar improvised bomb exploded outside the offices of Golden Dawn in the city of [[Larissa]], central Greece. The explosion caused only material damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grreporter.info/en/explosion_golden_dawn_office/8721 Explosion in a Golden Dawn office] Gr Reporter, 14 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liana Kanelli assault and reactions===
On 7 June 2012, Golden Dawn spokesman [[Ilias Kasidiaris]] slapped [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist]] MP [[Liana Kanelli]] about the head three times during a live debate on the morning show ''[[Proino ANT1]]''; she had thrown a newspaper and verbal abuse at him during the previous commercial break. Kasidiaris was subsequently locked in a room by the staff of the [[ANT1]] TV station, but he knocked down the door and left. Greek prosecutors issued an arrest warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18352258 |title=Greek far-right Golden Dawn MP wanted for assault BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golden Dawn blamed Kanelli for the incident. The incident resulted in several protests against Golden Dawn in Athens and other Greek cities. Political analyst Theodore Couloumbis told [[Reuters]] that the incident could cost Golden Dawn votes, especially among women, though other experts were of the opinion that images of violence could play in their favour—a Facebook page dedicated to Kasidiaris picked up 6,000 'likes' within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nathalie |last=Savaricas |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/antifascist-fury-in-athens-after-farright-mp-hit-rival-7831958.html |work=The Independent |date=9 June 2012 |title=Anti-fascist fury in Athens after far-right MP hit rival |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, a 35-year-old man alleged to have had ties to Golden Dawn was arrested for murder after Pavlos Fyssas, known as hip-hop artist Killah P, was stabbed twice following a brawl in [[Piraeus]].

==Allegations of connections to the Greek police==
In an interview with ''[[Eleftherotypia]]'' in 1998, [[Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection (Greece)|Minister for Public Order]] Georgios Romaios ([[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]]) alleged the existence of "fascist elements in the [[Hellenic Police]]", and vowed to suppress them.&lt;ref name="Romaios"&gt;[http://www.hri.org/news/grpapers/typos/1998/98-06-29.typos.html Athens News Agency: Press Review in Greek, 29 June 1998]. Hri.org (29 June 1998). Retrieved 27 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a TV interview that same year, Romaios again claimed that there was a pro-fascist group within the police force, although he said it was not organized and was only involved in isolated incidents.&lt;ref name="Ios98_3"&gt;[http://www.iospress.gr/ios1998/ios19980927c.htm Eleftherotypia's article] part 3 (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, ''Eleftherotypia'' published an article which outlined connections between the police and [[neo-fascism]].&lt;ref name="Ios98_1"&gt;[http://www.iospress.gr/ios1998/ios19980927c.htm Eleftherotypia article] part 1 (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; Dimitris Reppas, the PASOK [[Minister for the Press and the Media (Greece)|government spokesman]], strongly denied such connections. However, the article quoted a speech by the PASOK [[Hellenic Parliament|Member of Parliament]] Paraskevas Paraskevopoulos about a riot caused by right-wing [[extremism|extremists]], in which he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Thessaloniki it is widely discussed that far-right organisations are active in the security forces. Members of such organisations were the planners and chief executioners of the riot and nobody was arrested. A Special Forces officer, speaking at a briefing of Special Forces policemen who were to be on duty that day, told the policemen not to arrest anyone because the rioters were not enemies and threatened that should this be overlooked there would be penalties.&lt;ref name="Ios98_3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before the surrender of Androutsopoulos, an article in the newspaper ''[[Ta Nea]]'' claimed that Golden Dawn had a close relationship with elements of the Greek police force.&lt;ref name="TaNea" /&gt; In relation to the Periandros case, the article quoted an unidentified police officer who said that "half the force wanted Periandros arrested and the other half didn't". The article claimed that there was a confidential internal police investigation which concluded that:
# Golden Dawn had very good relations and contacts with officers of the force, on and off duty, as well as with rank and file police.
# The police provided the group with [[Baton (law enforcement)|baton]]s and radio communications equipment during mass demonstrations, mainly during celebrations of the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] and during rallies by left-wing and anarchist groups, in order to provoke riots.
# Periandros and the group's connections with the force largely delayed his arrest.
# Periandros's brother, also a member of Golden Dawn, was a security escort of an unnamed [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] MP.
# Many Golden Dawn members were illegally carrying an assortment of weapons.

The newspaper published a photograph of a typewritten paragraph with no identifiable insignia as evidence of the secret investigation.&lt;ref name="TaNeaGif"&gt;[http://assets.in.gr/assetservice/data/D2004/D0417/1el23c.gif Image from the article] of [[Ta Nea]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407071620/http://assets.in.gr/assetservice/data/D2004/D0417/1el23c.gif |date=7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister for Public Order, [[Michalis Chrysochoidis]], responded that he did not recollect such an investigation. Chrysochoidis also denied accusations that far-right connections within the police force delayed the arrest of Periandros. He said that leftist groups, including the ultra-left anti-state resistance group [[Revolutionary Organization 17 November|17 November]], responsible for several murders, had similarly evaded the police for decades. In both cases, he attributed the failures to "stupidity and incompetence" by the force.&lt;ref name="TaNea" /&gt;

In more recent years, anti-fascist and left-wing groups have claimed that many of Golden Dawn's members have close relationships or collaborated with Greece's Central Intelligence Service, the predecessor to the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|National Intelligence Service]], and accused Michaloliakos of working for the KYP from the 1980s. One piece of evidence for this, published in a Greek newspaper, was a payslip showing the names of both Michaloliakos and [[Konstantinos Plevris]] as operating for the agency, which Golden Dawn claimed was a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iospress.gr/mikro2000/mikro20000415.htm|title=Τα άλλα θύματα της πόλωσης}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "payslip", which was supposedly "signed" by a "Hellenic army's officer", was a fake, as was proven in court after Golden Dawn's complaint.&lt;ref name="fake_paper_KYP"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ezy.gr/plasto-to-eggrafo-ths-kup-kai-me-epishmh-apofash-dikasthriou/ |title=Πλαστό το έγγραφο της ΚΥΠ σύμφωνα με απόφαση 52803/4 Πρωτοδικείου Αθηνών |publisher=Πρωτοδικείο Αθηνών |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918042347/http://www.ezy.gr/plasto-to-eggrafo-ths-kup-kai-me-epishmh-apofash-dikasthriou/ |archivedate=18 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120419194537/http://xryshaygh.wordpress.com/2012/04/16/%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B1%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%86%CE%BF-%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%BA%CF%85%CF%80-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9-%CE%BC%CE%B5-%CE%B5%CF%80%CE%AF%CF%83/ "ΠΛΑΣΤΟ «το έγγραφο της ΚΥΠ» και με επίσημη απόφαση δικαστηρίου,"] (Απριλίου 16, 2012).

The party denies that it has any official connection to Neo-Nazism.

[[Ilias Kasidiaris]], a spokesman for Golden Dawn, wrote an article that was published in Golden Dawn magazine on 20 April 2011, in which he said, "What would the future of Europe and the whole modern world be like if World War II hadn't stopped the renewing route of National Socialism? Certainly, fundamental values which mainly derive from ancient Greek culture, would be dominant in every state and would define the fate of peoples. Romanticism as a spiritual movement and classicism would prevail against the decadent subculture that corroded the white man. Extreme materialism would have been discarded, giving its place to spiritual exaltation". In the same article, Adolf Hitler is characterized as a "great social reformer" and "military genius".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvxs.gr/news/ellada/o-kasidiaris-eksymnei-ton-xitler |title=Ο Κασιδιάρης εξυμνεί τον Χίτλερ, 17 September 2012 |publisher=tvxs.gr |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 August 1987 [[Rudolf Hess]], Adolf Hitler's deputy in the Nazi Party, committed suicide in Spandau Prison. The following day on 18 August 1987 Golden Dawn members distributed proclamations in the center of Athens with the phrase ''Rudolf Hess Immortal'' ({{lang-el|RUDOLF HESS ΑΘΑΝΑΤΟΣ}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tovima.gr/politics/article/?aid=476667 |title=Χρυσή Αυγή: Ύμνοι Χρυσής Αυγής για τον εγκληματία πολέμου Ρούντολφ Ες|work=Το Vima}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He claims that it was merely "the salute of the [[National Youth Organisation (Greece)|national youth organisation of Ioannis Metaxas]]".&lt;ref name="aljazeerasalute" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |url=http://tvxs.gr/news/%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B1/%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B6%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%AF-%CF%87%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%B5%CF%84%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%BF%CE%AF-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BF-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%B4%CE%AE%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%B1%CE%B8%CE%B7%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%AF%CF%89%CE%BD |publisher=tvxs.gr |title=Ναζιστικοί χαιρετισμοί στο συμβούλιο του Δήμου Αθηναίων | date=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Golden Dawn ran in Greek elections under the slogan "So we can rid this land of filth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/05/08/3094981/greeces-jewish-community-warns-of-return-to-fascism|title=Greece's Jewish community warns of return to fascism}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his post-election statement, the leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, had placed a marble eagle on an obvious position on his desk, which according to media reports bears similarity to the eagle of the Nazi [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsbomb.gr/politikh/story/185875/o-aetos-toy-mihaloliakoy-einai-diavoito-symvolo-ton-nazi|title=Ο αετός του Μιχαλολιάκου είναι διαβόητο σύμβολο των Ναζί|publisher=NewsBomb.gr|date=18 June 2012| accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the elections, Eleni Zaroulia, a Golden Dawn MP, wore an [[iron cross]] ring during her inauguration, a symbol which has been associated with Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvxs.gr/news/blogarontas/gnorizomaste|publisher=tvxs.gr|title=Το "παραμύθι" του Πολυτεχνείου και το ναζιστικό δαχτυλίδι|date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As depicted in a picture taken on 14 September 2012, Panagiotis Iliopoulos, another Golden Dawn MP, has a tattoo reading the Nazi greeting ''[[Sieg Heil]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvxs.gr/news/ellada/zigk-xail-toy-xrysaygiti-boyleyti |publisher=tvxs.gr |title=Το "ζιγκ χάιλ" του Χρυσαυγίτη βουλευτή |date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2012, Artemis Matthaiopoulos, a member of Golden Dawn, was elected as MP for the town of [[Serres]]. The website left.gr (associated with [[Syriza]]), reported that Matthaiopoulos was the frontman of the [[Nazi punk]] band "Pogrom" and pointed to the band's song "Auschwitz" with [[antisemitic]] lyrics such as "fuck Anne Frank" and "Juden raus" ("Jews out").&lt;ref name=leftgrpogrom&gt;{{cite news|title=Μετά τον Καιάδα και άλλος ροκ σταρ στη Βουλή με τη Χρυσή Αυγή |date=23 July 2012 |url=http://www.left.gr/article.php?id=4723 |accessdate=24 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725194947/http://www.left.gr/article.php?id=4723 |archivedate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Announcement for the new Golden Dawn member in Parliament |url=http://www.kis.gr/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=445:announcement-for-the-new-golden-dawn-member-in-parliament |publisher=Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece (KIS) |date=25 July 2012 |accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ilias Kasidiaris]] quoted the book ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' in a speech to parliament on 23 October 2012. Defending himself in a discussion on whether to lift his parliamentary immunity over his assault of Kanelli, he quoted Protocol 19: "In order to destroy the prestige of heroism we shall send them for trial in the category of theft, murder and every kind of abominable and filthy crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/protocols-of-the-elders-of-zion-read-aloud-in-greek-parliament/|title='Protocols of the Elders of Zion' read aloud in Greek parliament|date=26 October 2012|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Kasidiaris bears a swastika tattoo on his left arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/08/06/internacional/1375786954.html|title=La esvástica nazi entra en el parlamento heleno|author=Unidad Editorial Internet|date=6 August 2013|work=El Mundo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golden Dawn's leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, denied the existence of gas chambers and ovens at Nazi [[extermination camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Business Insider |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/now-the-greek-far-right-party-is-denying-the-holocaust-2012-5 |date=15 May 2012 |title=Now The Greek Far Right Party Is Denying The Holocaust}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Times of Israel |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/greek-jews-seek-outside-help-in-battle-against-surging-neo-nazi-party/ |date= 2 November 2012 |title=Greek Jews seek outside help in battle against surging neo-Nazi party}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 June 2013, the Golden Dawn MP Ilias Kasidiaris implied during a stormy debate in the Greek Parliament that he is a Holocaust denier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/greek-neo-nazi-lawmaker-indicates-he-is-a-holocaust-denier-1.528483 |date=7 June 2013 |title=Greek neo-Nazi lawmaker indicates he is a Holocaust denier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Golden Dawn MP [[Ilias Panagiotaros]] described Hitler as a "great personality, like Stalin" and denounced homosexuality as a "sickness". Panagiotaros also described most immigrant Muslims to Greece as, "Jihadists; fanatic Muslims" and claimed that he supported the concept of a one-race nation, stating, "if you are talking about nation, it is one race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Haaretz |url=http://vimeo.com/91838843 |date=18 April 2014 |title=60 Minutes.

==Rejection of same-sex civil partnerships==

In December 2015, the Golden Dawn was one of the main groups to reject a bill to allow civil partnerships for same-sex couples in Greece. Party leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos stated, "church bells should toll mournfully across the country".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-rights-vote/greece-allows-civil-partnership-for-same-sex-couples-idUSKBN0U52HK20151223 Greece allows civil partnership for same-sex couples]. Reuters. Published 23 December 2015.

Published 23 December 2015. Retrieved 24 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on foreign policy==
Nikolaos Michaloliakos supports a revival of the ''[[Megali Idea]]'', the [[irredentism|irredentist]] concept that guided Greece's foreign policy until [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)|the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–22]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=el:Μιχαλολιάκος: Του χρόνου στην Κωνσταντινούπολη, στην Σμύρνη, στην Τραπεζούντα…|url=http://www.stoxos.gr/2012/12/blog-post_7247.html|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=[[Stochos]]|date=31 December 2012|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For two thousand years, the Jews would say a wish during their festivals, "[[next year in Jerusalem]]", and ultimately after many centuries they managed to make it a reality. So I too conclude with a wish: Next year in [[Constantinople]], in [[Smyrna]], in [[Trabzon|Trebizond]]!}}

These regions, which in the past were Greek lands, had significant Greek populations until the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] in the 1920s. Michaloliakos has criticized [[Thessaloniki]] mayor [[Yiannis Boutaris]] for wanting to name a street after [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], who was born in the city.&lt;ref name="todayszaman1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smyrna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/greek-fuhrer-vows-to-take-back-izmir-after-istanbul.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=23248|title=Greek 'Führer' vows to 'take back İzmir' after Istanbul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, a group of Golden Dawn supporters attacked the car of Turkish [[consul (representative)|consul-general]] Osman İlhan Şener in [[Komotini]] during an [[Anti-Turkism|anti-Turkey]] protest. The party members also insulted Atatürk during the attack.&lt;ref name=komotiniAttack&gt;{{cite web|title=Yunanistan'da Türk konsolosun aracına saldırı|url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25412725|publisher=NTVMSNBC|accessdate=10 January 2013|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Golden Dawn promotes a hardline stance on the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], rejecting any compromise solution that would include the term ''[[Macedonia (terminology)|Macedonia]]'' in the name of the former Yugoslav republic, on the basis that only [[Greek Macedonia]] is entitled to use the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=el:Όταν κάποιοι αναγνωρίζουν τα Σκόπια ως "Μακεδονία"|url=http://xryshaygh.com/index.php/enimerosi/view/otan-kapoioi-anagnwrizoun-ta-skopia-ws-makedonia|publisher=Golden Dawn|accessdate=3 November 2013|language=Greek|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mihaloliakos has also called for the "liberation" of [[Northern Epirus]], which is today part of southern [[Albania]], has a [[Greeks in Albania|Greek minority]] and is claimed by Greek irredentists. Golden Dawn and its Cypriot counterpart [[ELAM (Cyprus)|ELAM]] support ''[[enosis]]'', the union of Cyprus with Greece.

Election advertisements for Golden Dawn have depicted the burning of [[Flag of the United States|US]] and [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flags]], a reflection of the party's strong [[anti-Americanism|anti-American]] and [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] position.&lt;ref name="northepirus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/05/07/148044/neo-nazi-party-plots-rise-as-first.html|title=Neo-Nazi party plots rise as first effort to form new Greek government fails}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2018, the party's MEPs voted in favour of increased security coordination with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=VoteWatch|date=4 July 2018|url=https://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-opening-of-negotiations-for-an-eu-israel-agreement-on-the-exchange-of-personal-data-for-fighting-ser.html#/##vote-tabs-list-2|title=Opening of negotiations for an EU-Israel Agreement on the exchange of personal data for fighting serious crime and terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golden Dawn is also staunchly [[euroscepticism|eurosceptic]], opposing Greece's participation in the [[European Union]] and the [[eurozone]].&lt;ref name=eurosceptic&gt;{{cite web|script-title=el:Πολιτικές Θέσεις|url=http://xryshaygh.com/index.php/kinima/thesis|publisher=Golden Dawn|accessdate=3 November 2013|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="euroscepticism"&gt;{{cite web |title=In crisis-ridden Europe, euroscepticism is the new cultural trend

Golden Dawn has spoken out in favor of Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] following the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://forward.com/articles/171423/greek-neo-nazi-golden-dawn-party-blasts-holocaust | title= Greek Neo-Nazi Golden Dawn Party Blasts Holocaust Remembrance as 'Unacceptable' | publisher= [[The Jewish Daily Forward]] | date= 18 February 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Golden Dawn aims to expand globally, with its spokesman saying in 2013 that the party planned to establish cells "wherever there are Greeks."&lt;ref name="SmithGlobal"&gt;Helena Smith, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/01/greece-golden-dawn-global-ambitions Greece's neo-Nazi Golden Dawn goes global with political ambitions], ''The Guardian'' (1 April 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, the party has opened branches in Germany,&lt;ref name="SmithGlobal"/&gt; Canada ([[Montreal]]),&lt;ref&gt;Justin Ling, [http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/anti-immigrant-greek-political-party-accused-of-being-racist-opens-canadian-chapter Anti-immigrant Greek political party accused of being racist opens Canadian chapter], ''National Post'' (28 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States (primarily [[Astoria, Queens]] and [[Tarpon Springs, Florida]]),&lt;ref name="ADL2013"&gt;[http://blog.adl.org/international/neo-nazi-golden-dawn-party-expands-presence-in-u-s Neo-Nazi Golden Dawn Party Expands Presence in U.S.], [[Anti-Defamation League]] (11 October 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2014/greek-neo-nazi-organization-continues-spread-us Greek Neo-Nazi Organization Continues to Spread in the U.S.], ''Intelligence Report'', [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (Spring 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rugh, [https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/new-york-citys-greek-fascists-cant-keep-a-dinner-date NYC's Greek Fascists the Golden Dawn Are Terrible Dinner Dates], [[VICE News]] (1 April 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and has also aimed to establish a presence in [[Melbourne]], Australia.&lt;ref name="SmithGlobal"/&gt; Leaders among the [[Greek diaspora]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church]] have denounced the group's ideology; they say only a tiny portion of Greeks abroad support the group.&lt;ref name="SmithGlobal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADL2013"/&gt; A branch in [[Trieste, Italy]] called ''Alba Dorata'' was formed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.digitaljournal.com/article/336773&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''High Assurance Guard''' (HAG) is a [[Multilevel security]] computer device which is used to communicate between different [[Security Domains]], such as [[NIPRNet]] to [[SIPRNet]]. A HAG is one example of a [[Controlled Interface]] between security levels. HAGs are approved through the [[Common Criteria]] process.

==Operation==
A HAG runs multiple [[virtual machines]] or physical machines - one or more subsystems for the lower classification, one (or more) subsystems for the higher classification. The hardware runs a type of [[Knowledge Management]] software that examines data coming out of the higher classification subsystem and rejects any data that is classified higher than the lower classification. In general, a HAG allows lower classified data that resides on a higher classified system to be moved to another lower classified system. For example, in the US, it would allow unclassified information residing on a Secret classified system to be moved to another Unclassified system. Through various rules and filters, the HAG ensures that data is of the lower classification and then allows the transfer.

On the application layer, the HAG runs an "evaluated mandatory integrity policy" that provides sensitive files, data and applications protection from inadvertent disclosure.  At the operating system level, the HAG must have a multi-level kernel that ensures sensitive information, processes, and devices stored and running on the system at different sensitivity levels cannot intermingle in violation of the system's mandatory security model.

The systems are certified via the Common Criteria; depending on the classification, the system may require Common Criteria Evaluated Assurance Level (EAL) 3 or higher.  For examples, in the US, an evaluation at the EAL 5 or EAL 5+ (EAL 5 Augmented) or higher is required to export from a Secret domain to an Unclassified domain.

Some manufacturers may use "Trusted Computer System" or "Trusted Applications with High Assurance" as an equivalent term to HAG.

==Importance, risks==
The HAG is mostly used in email and [[Defense Message System|DMS]] environments as certain organizations may only have unclassified network access, and they need to send a message to an organization that has only secret network access. The HAG provides them this ability.

{{Politics of Jordan}}

'''Human rights in [[Jordan]]''' are among the best and most respected in the [[Middle East]]. Although recently there have been far-reaching reforms of the laws and regulations in the country, abuses against basic rights such as freedom of expression persisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/18/jordan-reforms-abuses-persist|title=Jordan: Reforms, But Abuses Persist|work=HRW|date=1 January 2018|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Freedom House]], Jordan is ranked as the fourth-freest Arab country, and as "partly free" in the [[Freedom in the World]] 2017 report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2017/jordan|title=Jordan country report|work=Freedom House|accessdate=1 February 2017|date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Jordan is considered an "authoritarian regime" according to Democracy Index.

==History==
The [[2011 Jordanian protests]] began in the wake of unrest in [[Tunisia]] and [[Egypt]]. Starting in January 2011, several thousand Jordanians staged weekly demonstrations and marches in [[Amman]] (the capital) and other cities to protest government corruption, rising prices, poverty, and high unemployment.&lt;ref name=CIAFactbook-Jordan&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jo.html "World Factbook: Jordan"], U.S. Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II]] replaced his prime minister and formed a National Dialogue Commission with a mandate to carry out reforms. The king told the new prime minister to "take quick, concrete, and practical steps to launch a genuine political reform process," "to strengthen democracy," and to provide Jordanians with the "dignified life they deserve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Derhally |first=Massoud A |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-01/jordan-s-prime-minister-rifai-resigns-king-asks-bakhit-to-form-government.html |title=Jordan's King Abdullah Replaces Prime Minister |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=1 February 2011|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called for an "immediate revision" of laws governing politics and public freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apnews.myway.com//article/20110201/D9L410G00.html |title=Jordan's king fires Cabinet amid protests |publisher=Apnews.myway.com |date=|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, reports have shown good initial results but much work remaining to be done.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/03/08/jordan-measure-reform "Jordan: A Measure of Reform"], Christoph Wilcke, Jordan Times, 8 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Democracy==
Jordan is a [[constitutional monarchy]] ruled by [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II bin Hussein]]. The constitution concentrates executive and legislative authority in the king.

Jordan has a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]], the National Assembly, consisting of an upper house, the [[Senate of Jordan|Assembly of Senators]], appointed by the king and an elected lower house, the [[Parliament of Jordan|Chamber of Deputies]]. The members of both houses hold office for four-year terms. There are 60 seats in the Senate and 120 in the Chamber of Deputies. In the Chamber of Deputies 12 seats are reserved for women, 9 seats for Christian candidates, 9 for Bedouin candidates, and 3 for Jordanians of Chechen or Circassian descent.&lt;ref name=CIAFactbook-Jordan/&gt; The Assembly of Senators is responsible to the [[Chamber of Deputies]] and can be dismissed by "a vote of no confidence". The king may dissolve the National Assembly, forcing new elections. King Abdullah did that on 24 November 2009, and the government ruled by decree through most of 2010, until new elections were held in November. Parliamentary elections have been deemed credible by international observers. The king signs and executes all laws, but his veto power can be overridden by two-thirds vote of the National Assembly. The judicial branch is completely independent. Security forces report to civilian authorities.&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/&gt;

The law does not provide citizens the right to change their monarch or government. The king appoints and dismisses the prime minister, cabinet, the Assembly of Senators, and judges, may dissolve parliament, commands the military, and directs major public policy initiatives. The cabinet, based on the prime minister's recommendation, appoints the mayors of Amman, Wadi Musa (Petra), and Aqaba, a special economic zone. The mayors of the other 93 municipalities are elected.&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/&gt;

Opposition movements are legal in Jordan and are involved in Jordan's political life. The government licenses political parties and other associations and prohibits membership in unlicensed political parties. There are over 50 licensed political parties, but only a few have a substantial impact at the national level.

Jordan ranked sixth among the 19 countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, and 50th out of 178 countries worldwide in the 2010 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (CPI) issued by [[Transparency International]], where 1st is the least corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results "Corruption Perceptions Index 2010 Results"], Transparency International&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan's 2010 CPI score was 4.7 on a scale from 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 (very clean). Jordan ratified the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] (UNCAC) in February 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/signatories.html "Signatories to the United Nations Convention against Corruption"], United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 1 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a regional leader in spearheading efforts to promote the UNCAC and its implementation.&lt;ref name="jordaninvestment.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jordaninvestment.com/JordanataGlance/SecurityPoliticalStability/tabid/72/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=Security &amp; Political Stability |publisher=Jordaninvestment.com |accessdate=2010-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725064836/http://www.jordaninvestment.com/JordanataGlance/SecurityPoliticalStability/tabid/72/language/en-US/Default.aspx |archivedate=25 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedoms==

The Jordanian constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press; however, the government does not fully respect these rights in practice.&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154464.htm "Section 2(a) Freedom of Speech and Press, 2010 Human Rights Report: Jordan"], Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2009 annual report the Amman-based National Center for Defending the Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) concluded that media freedoms deteriorated in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdfj.org/ "Center for Defending the Freedom of Journalists"], website&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the [[Press Freedom Index|2010 Press Freedom Index]] maintained by [[Reporters Without Borders]], Jordan ranked 120th out of 178 countries listed, 5th out of the 20 countries in the Middle East and North Africa region. Jordan's score was 37 on a scale from 0 (most free) to 105 (least free).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2010,1034.html Press Freedom Index 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721221055/http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2010,1034.html |date=21 July 2011 }}, Reporters Without Borders, 20 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The law provides for up to three years' imprisonment for insulting the king, slandering the government or foreign leaders, offending religious beliefs, or stirring sectarian strife and sedition. In practice citizens are generally able to criticize the government, although they reportedly exercise caution in regard to the king, the royal family, the [[General Intelligence Directorate (Jordan)|General Intelligence Directorate]] (GID), and other sensitive topics such as religion.&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/&gt;

The government continues to enforce bans on the publication of selected books for religious, moral, and political reasons, some foreign films are edited prior to release, and the media is directly and indirectly censored. Authorities monitor and censor printing presses and edit articles deemed offensive before they can be printed. Journalists claim the government uses informants in newsrooms and that GID officials monitor reporting. Editors reportedly receive telephone calls from security officials instructing them how to cover events or to refrain from covering certain topics or events. Government officials also reportedly bribe journalists to influence their reporting. Media observers note that when covering controversial subjects, government-owned [[Jordan Radio and Television]] and [[Jordan News Agency]] reported only the government's position.&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/&gt;

Journalists report that the threat of detention and imprisonment under the penal code for a variety of offenses, and stringent fines of as much as 20,000 dinars ($28,000) under the press and publications law for defamation leads to self-censorship. According to a 2009 Center for Defending the Freedom of Journalists survey, 95 percent of journalists polled exercised self-censorship. The survey also reported that 70 percent of journalists thought the government used "soft containment", such as financial support, scholarships for relatives, and special invitations, to control the media at a medium to high degree. Ninety-four percent said they avoid writing about or broadcasting military matters, and 83 percent said they avoid discussing religious topics.&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/&gt;

There were several cases in which the government prohibited journalists from reporting on high-profile court cases. For example, a [[State Security Court]] attorney general prohibited the press from reporting or commenting on the case of the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company expansion project without his personal approval, purportedly to allow the judicial authorities to work "calmly" on the case.&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/&gt;

The clash between Jordanian media and the Lower House has been a chronic struggle for decades. The state of press freedom in Jordan is very fickle, at one point Jordan had one of the most vocal media in the Arab World, but a series of laws passed by Parliament greatly restricted press freedom. The Jordanian media has been very vocal expressing its opposition towards Parliament often leading to clashes. One Jordanian journalist wrote a fiery article called "For God Sake, Abdullah", in which he called on King Abdullah to dissolve the corrupt Lower House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menassat.com/?q=en/news-articles/6143-jordans-news-websites-running-legal-cover "Jordan's news websites running for legal cover"], Oula Farawati, Menassat, 11 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was prosecuted by the Lower House, but was later acquitted by the judiciary.

In October 2001, the government amended the Penal Code and introduced a restrictive Press Law that effectively revokes the relative freedom of the press guaranteed by the 1993 Press Law and punishes any act that can be deemed critical of the Jordanian government. Anyone who "slanders" the King or other members of the royal family can be sentenced to three years imprisonment. The introduction of these new laws has led to the detention and imprisonment of several journalists and leaders of peaceful associations.

In May 2006, two journalists involved in reprinting three of the 12 [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons]] were issued a two-month prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ar.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=17864 "First prison sentences announced for reprinting Mohammed cartoons"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Reporters Without Borders, 31 May 2006, accessed 13 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan was the only Muslim country to reprint the Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammed in one of its newspapers. The two Jordanian editors responsible were sacked and pressured to issue a public apology.

In the beginning of 2009, King Abdullah II issued a royal decree forbidding jailing of journalists in Jordan, an act praised by human rights groups in Jordan and around the world.&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/&gt;

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], Jordanian authorities has used counterterrorism laws to prosecute activists, [[Dissident|dissidents]], [[Journalist|journalists]] and Islamic preachers for speech offenses, the authorities depends largely on counterterrorism law that extended the definition of [[terrorism]] to include acts such as disturbing Jordan's relations with a foreign state. In February, a senior [[Muslim Brotherhood]] figure, Zaki Bani Irsheid, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after a post on [[Facebook]] criticizing the [[United Arab Emirates]]. In June, Eyad Qunaibi, an Islamic preacher, was arrested after posting Facebook comments criticizing the liberal lifestyle of a segment of the Jordanian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/jordan|title=Jordan|date=2016-01-11|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan is listed as engaged in selective internet filtering in the political area and as showing no evidence of filtering in the social, conflict/security, and Internet tools areas by the OpenNet Initiative (ONI) in August 2009. Internet censorship in Jordan is relatively light, with filtering selectively applied to only a small number of sites. However, media laws and regulations encourage some measure of self-censorship in cyberspace, and citizens have reportedly been questioned and arrested for Web content they have authored. Internet censorship in Jordan is mainly focused on political issues that might be seen as a threat to national security due to the nation's close proximity to regional hotspots of [[Israel]], Iraq, [[Lebanon]], and the [[Palestinian territories]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://opennet.net/research/profiles/jordan "ONI Country Profile: Jordan"], OpenNet Initiative, 6 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, however, the Press and Publications Department initiated a ban on Jordanian news websites which had not registered and been licensed by government agency. The order issued to Telecommunication Regulatory Commission contained a list of over 300 websites to be blocked. The mandatory registration of websites was a part of amendments made to the Press and Publications Law in September 2012. The amendments included articles that would hold online news sites accountable for the comments left by their readers, prohibiting them from publishing comments that are deemed "irrelevant" or "unrelated" to the article. The restriction caused several prominent sites to turn off their comments sections. Online news sites are required to archive all comments for at least six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://7iber.com/2013/06/internet-blocking-begins-in-jordan/|title=Internet Blocking Begins In Jordan|date=2013-06-02|accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of religion===
{{main|Freedom of religion in Jordan}}

According to US Department of State's Human Rights Reports in 2015 legal and societal discrimination and harassment remained a problem for religious minorities, and religious converts.&lt;ref name="US State"&gt;{{cite web|title=JORDAN 2015 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/253143.pdf|website=US Department of State|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jordanian Constitution provides for the freedom to practice one's religion in accordance with the customs in the Kingdom, unless they violate public order or morality. Jordan's state religion is Islam. The Government bans conversion from Islam and efforts to proselytize Muslims. While proselytizing to Christians may not be banned, it is equally not favored and very hampered with bureaucratic red tape that renders it near impossible to legalize.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148826.htm "Country report for Jordan"], ''International Religious Freedom Report 2010'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 17 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The US State Department's International Religious Freedom Report of 2009 indicated that there were "no reports that the practice of any faith was prohibited" in Jordan. In fact, Jordan has been highlighted as a model of interfaith dialogue. The study also concluded that in the last year there were "no reports of misuse or neglect" of the Kingdom's diverse religious sites, as well as no reports of "harassment, discrimination, or restrictions" to worshippers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=21117 |title=Jordan's religious freedom record lauded |author=Taylor Luck |newspaper=[[The Jordan Times]] |date=28 October 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians are well integrated into the Kingdom's political and economic landscapes. At least one Christian holds a ministerial post in every government, nine seats in the 120-seat Parliament are reserved for Christians, and a similar number is appointed to the Upper House by the King. In addition, Christians have traditionally prospered in the kingdom to the extent that Jordanian Christians are believed to own or run about a third of the Jordanian economy despite making up only 6% of the total population. They serve in the military, many have high positions in the army, and they have established good relations with the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jordan-business.net/magazine/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=235&amp;Itemid=40 |title=Born Again Problems |publisher=Jordan Business |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope has been to Jordan, where he was welcomed by the royal family.

==Human trafficking and migrant workers==
{{main|Human trafficking in Jordan}}
Jordan is a destination for women and men subjected to [[Human trafficking|trafficking in persons]], specifically conditions of [[forced labor]] and, to a lesser extent, forced prostitution. Jordan is possibly a source and transit country for women and men subjected to conditions of forced labor and forced commercial sexual exploitation. There are also reports of Jordanian [[child labour|child laborers]] experiencing conditions of forced labor.&lt;ref name=USDOS-TIPR2010-Jordan&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142760.htm "Jordan Country Narrative"], Trafficking in Persons Report 2010, Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;

Moroccan and Tunisian women are reportedly subjected to forced prostitution after migrating to Jordan to work in restaurants and night clubs. In addition, a few Chinese, Bangladeshi, Indian, Sri Lankan, and Vietnamese men and women encountered conditions indicative of forced labor in a few factories in the garment sector, including factories in Jordan's Qualifying Industrial Zones, such as the unlawful withholding of passports, delayed payment of wages, and, in a few cases, verbal and physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/Nov/07/Jordan-not-protecting-rights-of-women-migrant-workers.ashx#axzz1N6WZEOyz "Jordan 'not protecting' rights of women migrant workers"], Agence France Presse (AFP) in the ''Daily Star'', 7 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Instances of forced labor reportedly continued to decline due to enhanced labor inspections and other recent measures undertaken by the government within the garment sector. NGOs and the media also report the forced labor of Egyptian workers in the construction, agriculture, and tourism sectors. Jordan's airports may be transit points for South- and Southeast-Asian men and women en route to employment opportunities in other Middle Eastern countries, where they experience labor exploitation after arrival. Some Jordanian children employed within the country as street vendors, carpenters, painters, mechanics, domestics, restaurant staff, or agricultural laborers may be exploited in situations of forced labor.&lt;ref name=USDOS-TIPR2010-Jordan/&gt;

In 2009, an Anti-Human Trafficking Law was endorsed by the government that severely restricts human trafficking in the Kingdom and creates a committee to promote public awareness on the issue. Jordan in cooperation with the Filipino Government worked out an agreement which gave a wide range of rights to domestic workers and access to legal protection, the first Arab country to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/130217/Jordan-to-include-migrant-workers-in-its-labor-laws "Jordan to include migrant workers in its labor laws"], GMA News Online, 28 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

New regulations to regulate the working conditions of all domestic workers prescribe maximum working hours, rights to holiday and sick leave, and domestic workers' entitlement to regular contact with their own families. According to Amnesty International, despite addressing important issues, the regulations are loosely worded and open to interpretation in certain respects, fail to specify mechanisms for determining wages, or to resolve long-standing problems related to nonpayment of wages or low wages. They also fail to provide effective safeguards against physical violence and sexual abuse by employers of domestic workers, the great majority of whom are women, and appear to place women at risk by requiring domestic workers to obtain their employer's permission before leaving their house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-jordan-2010?page=2 "Migrants' rights – domestic workers"], on page 2 of ''Annual Report: Jordan 2010'', Amnesty International, 28 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

While there has been some improvement in combating human trafficking, Jordan remains a Tier 2 country (countries whose governments do not fully comply with the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act's minimum standards,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142765.htm "Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, Div. A of Pub. L. No. 106-386, § 108, as amended"], Trafficking in Persons Report 2010, Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt; but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards) in the U.S. State Department's ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'' because victim assistance, public awareness raising, punishment of traffickers, and active cooperation with source country embassies remain limited.&lt;ref name=USDOS-TIPR2010-Jordan/&gt;

==Unrestrained violence, torture, and honor killings==

[[Torture]] is illegal in Jordan, however it remains widespread. According to a report by [[Amnesty International]], intelligence agents in Jordan frequently use torture to extract confessions from [[Terrorism|terror]] suspects. Common tactics include, "beating, sleep deprivation, extended solitary confinement, and physical suspension." Palestinians and suspected [[Islamism|Islamists]] are treated especially harshly. Though Jordan has improved many procedures including a prison reform campaign in partnership with EU in this respect, agents at the [[General Intelligence Department]] remain largely immune to punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]], 24 July 2006, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE16/008/2006/en "Systematic Torture of Political Suspects Entrenched in Jordan"], Retrieved 12 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]], 23 July 2006, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE16/005/2006 Jordan: "Your confessions are ready for you to sign": Detention and torture of political suspects]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, the [[UN Committee against Torture]] reiterated long-standing concerns at Jordan's failure to investigate and prosecute allegations of torture, to provide adequate protection against torture, and to prosecute perpetrators in accordance with the seriousness of the crime. It noted the "numerous, consistent and credible allegations of a widespread and routine practice of torture and ill-treatment" including in General Intelligence Department (GID) and Criminal Investigations Department detention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B9C2E/%28httpNewsByYear_en%29/539D76CD77AEE766C125772300342DBB?OpenDocument "Committee Against Torture Concludes Forty-fourth Session"], United Nations, 14 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The government did not respond to the Committee's recommendations.&lt;ref name=AIR-2011&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/jordan/report-2011 "Annual Report 2011: Jordan"], Amnesty International&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rana Husseini of ''The Jordan Times'', there were 12 recorded "[[honor killing]]s" in Jordan from January to November 2010.&lt;ref name=HRW-Jordan&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/middle-eastn-africa/jordan "Human Rights Watch: Jordan"], Human Rights Watch, accessed 23 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; These so-called "honor killings", the killing of female relatives suspected of illicit relationships, are often lightly punished by police and the courts. There have been several attempts to introduce harsh penalties on honor crimes, but, even with the strong backing of the royal family, these attempts have been rejected by Jordan's Lower House.&lt;ref name="amm"&gt;[[Amnesty International]]: [http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/jordan/index.do Human Rights Concerns for Jordan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823191439/http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/jordan/index.do |date=23 August 2006 }} Retrieved 10 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3088828.stm | accessdate = 12 August 2006 | work=BBC News | title='Honour killings' law blocked | date=8 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, the government decreed amendments to the penal code to ensure that "honor" crimes receive the full penalty of the law.&lt;ref name=AIR-2011/&gt;

==Death penalty==
{{main|Capital punishment in Jordan}}
After a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] since 2006 there were eleven executions on 21 December 2014, all detainees were men convicted of murder.&lt;ref name=aljazeera&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/12/jordan-hangs-11-after-lifting-execution-ban-201412218257159168.html |title=Jordan hangs 11 after lifting execution ban |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=21 December 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments to the penal code have reduced the number of capital offenses. State security, smuggling, arson resulting in death, and inciting armed riot cases are no longer capital crimes. In March 2010, the Justice Minister announced that the crime of rape may cease to be a capital offense. In the future it is possible that the death penalty will be limited to cases of murder.

At the end of 2010 the government reports that 46 people were under sentence of death and six new death sentences were imposed during the year. Amnesty International reports nine new death sentences in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/001/2011/en/ ''Death Sentences and Executions in 2010''] , Amnesty International, 2011, pp. 26 and 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifteen executions were carried on dawn of 4 March 2017; ten convicted with terrorism and the remaining 5 with murder and rape of minors. Those convicted with terrorism were part of a terror attack in [[Irbid]], an attack on intelligence officers and the attack on Jordanian writer [[Nahed Hattar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39165220|title=Jordan executes 15 prisoners, 10 convicted of terror charges|work=BBC|date=4 March 2017|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest, detention, fair and speedy trials, and prison conditions==

Jordanian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, but according to local and international human rights groups, the government does not always observe these prohibitions in practice.&lt;ref name=AIR-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/&gt;

Citizens and NGOs allege that the government continues to detain individuals, including political opposition members, for political reasons, and that governors continued to use administrative detentions for what appeared to be political reasons. In a few cases, the media and human rights organizations reported that authorities kept detainees in solitary confinement and denied them access to lawyers.&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/&gt;

Human rights observers claimed that police make arrests before obtaining warrants and prosecutors fail to file charges or seek extensions in a timely manner. Prosecutors routinely request and are granted extensions that increase the period to file formal charges to as long as six months for a felony and two months for a misdemeanor. This practice can lengthen pretrial detention for protracted periods. Some detainees report not being allowed timely access to a lawyer, but authorities generally permit visits by family members.&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/&gt;

In facilities operated by the General Intelligence Directorate (GID) there are allegations of long periods of incommunicado detention, lengthy pretrial detention without being informed of charges, and not allowing defendants to meet with their lawyers or permitting meetings only shortly before trial.&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/&gt;

Under the Crime Prevention Law, provincial governors may detain individuals suspected of planning to commit a crime or those who allegedly shelter thieves, habitually steal, or constitute a danger to the public, and in practice they used this provision widely. Those accused are subject to imprisonment or house arrest as "administrative detention" without formal charges. A detention order may be for as long as one year, but governors can impose new orders to prolong detentions. International and national NGOs noted that governors routinely abused the law, imprisoning individuals when there was not enough evidence to convict them and prolonging detentions of prisoners whose sentences had expired. The law was also widely used to incarcerate women at risk of being honor crime victims.&lt;ref name=HRW-Jordan/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIR-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/05/26/jordan-end-administrative-detention "Jordan: End Administrative Detention"], Human Rights Watch, 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordanian law provides for an independent judiciary; however, the judiciary's independence in practice may be compromised by nepotism and the influence of special interests.&lt;ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/&gt;&lt;ref name=FHCountryRatings-Jordan-2010/&gt;

The law presumes that all defendants are innocent until proven guilty. Juries are not used. Most trials in civilian courts are open and procedurally sound, but the [[State Security Court]] (SSC) may close its proceedings to the public.&lt;ref name=FHCountryRatings-Jordan-2010/&gt; Defendants are entitled to legal counsel, provided at public expense for the indigent in cases involving the death penalty or potential life imprisonment. In many cases defendants have no legal representation. Defendants can present witnesses on their behalf and question witnesses against them.

In 2009 of 18 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries surveyed, Jordan ranked in the upper third for each category (between 4th and 7th).&lt;ref name=FHCountryRatings-Jordan-2010/&gt;

Limited economic opportunity is one of the main reasons for poor scores in many of the above categories. It is not just discrimination that accounts for high rates of unemployment, but also genuine economic difficulties and shortages of jobs. "The shrinking of the public sector disproportionately affects women, the location of jobs matters more for women than for men, and discrimination in the private sector remains".&lt;ref&gt;[http://psclasses.ucdavis.edu/POL124/spr%2FPDF/JordanWomen.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=Employment%20and%20Unemployment%20in%20Jordan%3A%20The%20Importance%20of%20the%20Gender%20System(2001)%20Rebecca%20Miles&amp;ei=_WDZTbawJcfv0gGX8MD9Aw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQ8_B00p3QOblOGFQawqQSe1Gv7g&amp;cad=rja "Employment and Unemployment in Jordan: The Importance of the Gender System"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Rebecca Miles, Florida State University, Tallahassee, USA, ''World Development'', Vol.30, No.3 (2002), pp.413–427&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Freedom House criticized Jordan for its poor women's rights record, but also acknowledged that the "status of women in Jordan is currently undergoing a historic transition, with women achieving a number of positive gains and new rights."&lt;ref name=FHCountryRatings-Jordan-2005&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=384&amp;key=14&amp;parent=2&amp;report=56 "Jordan Country Report"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623061504/http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=384&amp;key=14&amp;parent=2&amp;report=56 |date=23 June 2011 }}, ''Women's Rights in the Middle East and North Africa 2005'', Reem M. Abu Hassan and Widad Adas, Freedom House, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Educated women were granted suffrage in 1955, but it was not until 1974 that all women received the right to vote and run as candidates in parliamentary elections. In 1993, the first female candidate was elected to the lower house of parliament and the first woman was appointed to the upper house. Women have assumed high-level governmental positions in greater numbers, gaining appointments as ministers and lawmakers with increasing frequency. An average of three ministerial portfolios has been assigned to women in each cabinet since 2004, and a gender-based quota system, first introduced for the lower house of parliament in 2003, was expanded to municipal councils in 2007.&lt;ref name=FHCountryRatings-Jordan-2010/&gt;

From 2004 until the end of 2009, the women's movement made a number of important gains, including the publication of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in the official gazette, which gave it the force of law. Additionally, the government has taken steps to address the problem of domestic abuse, including the February 2007 opening of the country's first major women's shelter, the Family Reconciliation House, and the March 2008 promulgation of the Family Protection Law, designed to regulate the handling of domestic abuse cases by medical workers and law enforcement bodies.&lt;ref name=FHCountryRatings-Jordan-2010/&gt;

Today, Jordanian women largely enjoy legal equality in freedom of movement, health care, education, political participation, and employment. And, while the attitudes of police officers, judges, and prosecutors regarding the treatment of victims of domestic violence and honor crimes have undergone a positive shift in recent years, gender-based violence remains a serious concern.&lt;ref name=FHCountryRatings-Jordan-2010/&gt;

There remains gender-based discrimination in family laws, in the provision of pensions and social security benefits, and on the societal level due to deeply entrenched patriarchal norms that restrict female employment and property ownership.&lt;ref name=FHCountryRatings-Jordan-2010/&gt; And women do not have the same status as men with respect to nationality. A Jordanian man may marry a foreigner and pass on his nationality to his children; women cannot. Nor can women pass on their nationality to their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415248969/ ''Women in Islam: The Western Experience''], Anne Sofie Roald, Routledge, London, April 2001, 360 pp., {{ISBN|978-0-415-24896-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are no longer required to seek permission from their male guardians or husbands before obtaining or renewing their passports, but fathers may still prevent their children from traveling regardless of the mother's wishes. Muslim women are prohibited from marrying men of other religions unless the spouse agrees to convert to Islam, while Muslim men are permitted to wed Christian and Jewish wives.&lt;ref name=FHCountryRatings-Jordan-2010/&gt;

== Child labor and forced labor ==
In 2013, the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s ''Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor'' reported that Jordan has "made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor" but that a percentage as low as 0.8% of children aged 5 to 14 continue to engage in child labor, mostly in the agricultural sector and in domestic service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/jordan.htm Jordan, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor]&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2014, the Department issued a ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' where Jordan figures among 74 other countries that resort to such labor practices. Jordan was reported to make use of forced labor in the garment industry.

==Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights==

[[Transgender]] Jordanians may be allowed to change their legal Sex, however [[Sex Reassignment Surgery]] is required.

==National human rights institution==

Jordan was one of the first countries in the Middle east to establish a [[national human rights institution]] (NHRI). The [[National Centre for Human Rights (Jordan)|National Centre for Human Rights]] (NCHR) in 2006 secured 'A-status' accreditation from the peer review process of the [[International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions|International Coordinating Committee of NHRIs]], giving it enhanced access to the United Nations human rights bodies. That status was subjected to special review twice by the ICC in 2007, and reaffirmed; it was again accorded A status under the ordinary review procedure in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nhri.ohchr.org/EN/Documents/Chart%20of%20the%20Status%20of%20NHRIs%20%28DIC%202011%29.pdf Chart of accreditation status of NHRIs]&lt;/ref&gt; In the ICC annual meeting in March 2012, the Jordanian institution was elected as chair of the network of 99 institutions. The Commissioner General of the NCHR is Dr Mousa Burayzat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nhri.ohchr.org/EN/WhoWeAre/News/Lists/News/DispForm.aspx?ID=53&amp;RootFolder=/EN/WhoWeAre/News/Lists/News&amp;Source=http://nhri.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/default.aspx ICC press release on Jordanian chair, March 2012]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|intentional flooding caused by humans|flooding by natural causes|Flood}}
[[File:Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie the Netherlands.png|thumb|250px|The New [[Hollandic Water Line]] as an example of a complex of controlled military inundations]]
'''Inundation''' (from the Latin ''inundatio'', flood) is both the act of intentionally [[flood]]ing land that would otherwise remain dry, for military, agricultural, or river-management purposes, and the result of such an act.

==Definition==
The noun "inundation" refers to both the ''act'' of inundating; an overflow; a flood; a rising and spreading of water over grounds; and to the ''state'' of being inundated; flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inundation|website=Wiktionary. The free dictionary|title=Inundation|access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should therefore be distinguished from other types of flooding, not caused by man. It should also be recognised that this type of flooding would not take place without the intentional human act. So e.g. tidal flooding of areas that fall dry at ebb tide, and periodical river floods are not inundations in the sense intended here.

The latter condition implies that in most [[Topography|topographies]] the act usually applies to causing an overflow of a river or stream by damming it. This is also the only method foreseen in the 1888 British military textbook that discusses the technique correctly under "military obstacles".&lt;ref&gt;Text book, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; However, in areas that have been reclaimed from the sea, marches or lakes, and are artificially protected from the waters (either accumulated precipitation, or the water source that would flood the reclaimed area, if it were not artificially protected), as in e.g. the artificial hydrological entities, known as [[Polder]]s, may be inundated by simply giving the water source access again. In the latter perspective inundation may simply be a form of [[hydraulic engineering]].
 
Before we limit the concept to military uses, it should be recognised that there are at least two other possible uses of inundation as a human act:
*agricultural uses, as in preparing [[paddy field]]s for the growing of semi-aquatic rice in many countries;
*river management, in the form of diverting flood waters in a river at flood stage upstream from areas that are considered more valuable than the areas that are sacrificed in this way (what one may call "prophylactic hydraulic engineering").This may be done ''ad hoc'' as in the 2011 intentional breach of [[levee]]s by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] in Missouri&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/05/02/missouri.levee.breach/index.html|website=CNN|title=Army Corps starts to blow up levee, flood 130,000 acres in Missouri|access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or permanently, as in the so-called ''overlaten'' (literally:"let-overs"), an intentionally lowered segment in Dutch  riparian levees, like the ''Beerse Overlaat'' in the left levee of the [[Meuse]]  between the villages of [[Gassel]] and [[Linden, North Brabant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heemkunderavenstein.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Canon-van-Ravenstein-versie-mei-2017-uitgelijnd.pdf|website=Heemkunde Ravenstein|access-date=May 23, 2018|title=Canon van Ravenstein. 23 De Beers komt|page=48|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military inundation==
[[File:Inundation.jpg|thumb|left|Example of an inundation [[sluice]] in the [[Hollandic Water Line]] near [[Utrecht]] for controlled inundation]]
Military inundation creates an obstacle in the field that is intended to impede the movement of the enemy. This may be done both for [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] and [[Defense (military)|defensive]] purposes. Furthermore, in so far as the methods used are a form of hydraulic engineering, it may be useful to differentiate between ''controlled'' inundations (as in most historic inundations in the Netherlands under the [[Dutch Republic]] and its [[Succession of states|successor states]] in that area&lt;ref&gt;Oosthoek; Tiegs, Brief history&lt;/ref&gt; and exemplified in the two [[Hollandic Water Line]]s, the [[Stelling van Amsterdam]], the [[Frisian Water Line]], the [[IJssel Line]], the [[Peel-Raam Line]], and the [[Grebbe line]] in that country) and ''uncontrolled'' ones (as in the [[Siege of Leiden#Second siege, and relief, of Leiden|second Siege of Leiden]]&lt;ref&gt;Tiegs, Past&lt;/ref&gt; during the  first part of the [[Eighty Years' War (1566–1609)|Eighty Years' War]], and the [[Inundation of Walcheren]], and the [[Inundation of the Wieringermeer]] during the [[Second World War]]). To count as ''controlled'' a military inundation has to take the interests of the civilian population into account, by allowing them a timely [[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]], by making the inundation ''reversible'', and by making an attempt to minimize the adverse [[Ecology|ecological]] impact of the inundation.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Ironically, one may consider ''controlled'' military inundation a form of [[flood control]]; Cf. [[Flood control in the Netherlands#Flooding as military defense]].&lt;/ref&gt; As Vandenbohed discusses,&lt;ref&gt;Vandenbohed, Hydrogeology&lt;/ref&gt; that impact may also be adverse in a [[Hydrogeology|hydrogeological]] sense if the inundation lasts a long time.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The 1977 [[Protocol I]], amending the [[Geneva Conventions]], may in art. 53 and 56 outlaw ''uncontrolled'' inundations.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a legal point of view a military inundation should therefore be seen as a government [[Eminent domain|"taking"]] of private property under the constitutional protection of private property in many countries. In the Netherlands this was the subject of art. 152 of the Dutch constitution of 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandele, W F. van der|title=Artikel 152 GW.|date=1889|publisher=P.

The '''libertarian perspective on immigration''' is often regarded as one of the core concepts of [[libertarian]] theory and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Libertarianism, What Everyone Needs to Know|last=Brennan|first=Jason|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=42, 50, 119, 125|quote= [Libertarians] believe everyone has the right to take employment in any other country, regardless of citizenship. They hold that, except in special circumstances, governments may not forbid citizens from leaving a country, nor may governments forbid foreigners from entering. (Page 42)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertarianism.org/guides/lectures/immigration-rights|title=Immigration Rights|last=Brennan|first=Jason|date=|website=Libertarianism.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some libertarians assert that "[e]fforts by the government to manage the labor market are as apt to fail as similar efforts to protect domestic industries or orchestrate industrial policy. [...] If an immigrant seeks to engage in peaceful, voluntary transactions that do not threaten the freedom or security of the native-born, the government should not interfere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Griswold |first= Dan|authorlink=Daniel T.

== Libertarian proponents of free immigration ==
{{see also|Free migration}}
[[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] has promoted [[illegal immigration]] as being a key part of the [[Counter-economics|counter-economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agorism.info/Counter-Economics.pdf |title=Counter-Economics: what it is, how it works |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325044459/http://agorism.info/Counter-Economics.pdf |archive-date=25 March 2009 |website=agorism.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian author [[Jacob Hornberger]], a proponent of freer immigration policies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/case-unilateral-free-trade-open-immigration/|title=The Case for Unilateral Free Trade and Open Immigration|last=Hornberger|first=Jacob|date=November 1, 1994|website=The Future of Freedom Foundation|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/lets-stick-traditional-american-values/|title=Let's Stick with Traditional American Values!|last=Hornberger|first=Jacob|date=February 1, 2000|website=The Future of Freedom Foundation|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that [[open border]]s is the only libertarian immigration position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/2016/05/19/open-borders-libertarian-position-immigration/|title=Open Borders Is the Only Libertarian Immigration Position|last=Hornberger|first=Jacob|date=May 19, 2016|website=The Future of Freedom Foundation|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeffrey Tucker]], Director of Content at the [[Foundation for Economic Education]],&lt;ref name="FEE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fee.org/authors/detail/jeffrey-a-tucker|title=Jeffrey A. Tucker |publisher=Foundation for Economic Education|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been critical of the closed-border arguments made by [[Libertarian conservatism|conservative-leaning libertarians]]:&lt;ref name="fee"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fee.org/articles/why-open-borders/ |title=Why Open Borders? |last=Tucker |first=Jeffrey |authorlink=Jeffrey Tucker |publisher=[[Foundation for Economic Education]] |date=2015-09-14 |accessdate=2016-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="altright"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fee.org/articles/five-differences-between-the-alt-right-and-libertarians/ |title=Five Differences Between the Alt-Right and Libertarianism |last=Tucker |first=Jeffrey |authorlink=Jeffrey Tucker |publisher=[[Foundation for Economic Education]] |date=2016-08-26 |accessdate=2016-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;This is a huge debate among people who otherwise swear fealty to "[[limited government]]." Many people who claim to want freedom seem to have no problem with the implications of a closed-border policy: national IDs, national work permits, non-stop surveillance, harassment of all businesses, a "papers please" culture, mass deportation, tens of billions in waste, bureaucrats wrecking the American dream, broken families, [and] the rights of Americans and foreigners transgressed at every turn.&lt;ref name="fee"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Libertarian opponents of free immigration ==

A significant strain of [[right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] thought, associated mainly with [[paleolibertarianism|paleolibertarians]] and [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe|Hoppean]] [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]], denies [[freedom of movement]] as a [[fundamental rights|fundamental right]], maintaining instead that in their preferred formally stateless society in which all land is privatized fully and absolutely, where economic and political power resides principally with private landowners, a policy of open immigration necessarily amounts to legalized trespassing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4772">'''New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, Inc.''' ("New York Lawyers" or "NYLPI" [nil-pee]) is a [[non-profit]] [[civil rights]] law firm located in [[New York City]], specializing in the areas of [[disability rights]], access to [[health care]] and [[environmental justice]].

NYLPI was founded in 1976 by eleven attorneys and nine law firms to meet the legal needs of underserved, underrepresented New Yorkers and their communities. This arrangement ultimately evolved into NYLPI's [[pro bono]] clearinghouse, which now matches volunteer lawyers from prestigious law firms and corporate legal departments with community groups and nonprofit organizations in need of legal services.

NYLPI also has a number of in-house staff attorneys, [[social worker]]s and [[community organizer]]s working in the organization's three areas of specialization.  NYLPI's Disability Justice Program "protects and promotes the civil rights of people with disabilities," its  Environmental Justice Program "provides organizing and legal assistance to low-income neighborhoods and communities of color that bear an unfair burden of environmental threats," and its Health Justice Program "works to ensure access to quality health care for people in medically underserved communities or facing barriers due to [[limited English proficiency]], racial and ethnic discrimination, and disability."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nylpi.org/ New York Lawyers for the Public Interest]&lt;/ref&gt;

NYLPI was once associated with the National Campaign to Restore Civil Rights (NCRCR), "a national collaboration of lawyers, academics, students, community activists, and concerned individuals who have joined together in response to recent federal court decisions that are eroding civil rights protections," but is no longer connected to it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollbackcampaign.org/ National Campaign to Restore Civil Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
NYLPI's mission is to advance equality and civil rights, with a focus on health justice, disability justice, and environmental justice, through the power of community lawyering and partnerships with the private bar.

==History==
New York Lawyers for the Public Interest originated in proposals submitted to the [[Association of the Bar of the City of New York]] in 1973 by its Young Lawyers Committee and the Council of New York Law Associates. Both addressed the need for legal services to organizations serving the public interest.  A Subcommittee on Legal Services Programs, appointed by Orville Schell, Jr., President of the Association, and chaired by [[David Sive]], was charged with making appropriate recommendations, and resulting issues were resolved under the Presidency of [[Cyrus R. Vance]] in 1975. Vance served as the organization's first Chairman and was succeeded by Schell in 1977, when Vance became Secretary of State.

The '''Office of the Auditor General''' ({{lang-my|ပြည်ထောင်စုစာရင်းစစ်ချုပ်ရုံး}}; abbreviated '''OAG''') is an independent government body that serves as the [[auditor]] of the [[Government of Burma]]. The Office of the Auditor General is currently held by U Maw Than.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oagmac.gov.mm/content/present}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Auditor General was U Myo Myint, and his predecessor was U Thein Htaik, appointed by President [[Thein Sein]] on 7 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:VhIE5-60hPoJ:www.myanmarpresidentoffice.info/en/%3Fq%3Dbriefing-room/orders/2012/09/07/id-641+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|title=Appointment of Auditor-General of the Union Order No. 34/2012|last=Thein Sein|date=7 September 2012|work=President Office|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Office of the Auditor General was first formally established during British rule, under the Burma Act of 1935.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oagmac.gov.mm/content/history|title=Profile of Myanmar Supreme Audit Institution |date=2011|work=OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL OF THE UNION|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In post-colonial Burma, the Office of the Auditor General was initially established in 1948 under the Parliament's Auditor General Act of 1948, which provided for the appointment of the Auditor General.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 1974, the [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] passed the Council of People’s Inspectors Law, which repealed the 1948 law and merged all auditing agencies, except the Controller of Military Accounts, into a centralised agency, the Central Accounts Office, in January 1974.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; On 27 September 1988, the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] (SLORC), which had recently seized power, appointed an Auditor General and Deputy Auditor General, under Order No. 7/88, and repealed the 1975 Law under Order No. 5/88 and the Auditor General Law of 1988.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; On 8 March 1994, the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] replaced the Accounting Law, which established an Office of the Auditor General of the Union (OAG) that acts as the Secretariat of the [[Myanmar Accountancy Council]], the nation's professional accountancy body.&lt;ref name="oag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oagmac.gov.mm/content/history-0|title=History|work=OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL OF THE UNION|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; OAG's functions are currently governed by the 2008 [[Constitution of Burma]] and the Auditor General of the Union Law of 2010, which repealed the 1988 law.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Thein Htaik died and a new Auditor General, U Myo Myint, was appointed to the position in 2016.

[[File:Manila declared open city.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Manila]] was declared an open city in December 1941 to avoid its destruction as [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] [[Japanese invasion of the Philippines|invaded]] the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]].]]
In [[war]], in the event of the imminent capture of a [[city]], the [[government]]/[[military]] structure of the [[State (polity)|state]] that controls the city will sometimes declare it an '''open city''', thus announcing that it has abandoned all defensive efforts. The attacking [[army|armies]] of the opposing military will then be expected not to [[aerial bombing of cities|bomb]] or otherwise attack the city but simply march in. The concept aims at protecting the city's resident [[civilian]]s and historic landmarks from an unnecessary battle.

Attacking forces do not always respect the declaration of an "open city". Defensive forces will use it as a political tactic as well.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Paul I. and Arlington, R. Rene. (1983) La Popessa: The Controversial Biography of Sister Pasqualina, the Most Powerful Woman in Vatican History. New York: Warner Books Inc. {{ISBN|0-446-51258-3}}, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the declaration of a city to be "open" is made by a side on the verge of defeat and surrender; in other cases, those making such a declaration are willing and able to fight on but prefer that the specific city be spared.

According to the [[Protocol I]] of the [[Geneva Conventions]], it is forbidden for the attacking party to "attack, by any means whatsoever, non-defended localities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Protocol I |wslink=Geneva_Convention/Protocol_I |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1977 |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Several cities were declared open during [[World War II]]:
*[[Kraków]] was left undefended (except for some small local units) after the [[6th Infantry Division (Poland)|Polish 6th Infantry Division]] marched by the city to the nearby [[Niepołomice Forest]] to set new defensive lines. This led the Mayor of Kraków to declare it an open city on 5 September 1939. The German army entered the city the next day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.krakowpost.com/1531/2009/09&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brussels]] was declared an open city by the Belgian Government in 1940 during the [[Battle of Belgium]]. It was later occupied by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MmVtBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;ots=L4VNnjLrV4&amp;dq=%22declared%20open%20city%22%20-manila%20-paris%20-rome&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=%22declared%20open%20city%22%20-manila%20-paris%20-rome&amp;f=false | title=Belgium in the Second World War | publisher=Pen and Sword | author=Veranneman, Jean-Michel | year=2014 | pages=35 | isbn=1783376074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Belgrade]] was declared open in April 1941 by the Government of Yugoslavia, just before the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]]. The German [[Wehrmacht]] did not respect the open city status and [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|heavily bombed the city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Istorija Jugoslavije 1918-1978 | publisher=Nolit | author=Petranović, Branko | year=1987 | location=Belgrade | pages=184 |trans-title=History of Yugoslavia 1918-1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar Japan===
In 1977, a far-left group in Japan—called the "National Open City Declaration Movement Network"—began organizing activists to make cities preemptively declare themselves "defenseless" under the Geneva Convention, so that in the event of war, they would be legally forced to welcome any invasion.&lt;ref&gt; Hiromichi Ikegami et al.

Municipality Research Company, 2006. {{ISBN|4880374504}} (無防備地域宣言で憲法9条のまちをつくる) {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was rejected by nearly all of Japan's political parties and the ruling government as inherently absurd, since Japan was not in a war, and in the event of war such a decision would have to be approved by the national government.&lt;ref&gt;Prime Minister of Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5766">The '''Forest Service Organic Administration Act of 1897''' provided the main statutory basis for the management of [[forest reserve]]s in the [[United States]], hence the commonly used term "Organic Act". The legislation's formal title is the '''Sundry Civil Appropriations Act of 1897''', which was signed into law on June 4, 1897, by President [[William McKinley]].

This law was the first step toward legislation concerning the management, protection and care of the nation's forest reserves. Its features include:

#It specified the purpose for establishing reserves as well as the administration and protection.
#It granted the Secretary of the [[United States Department of the Interior]] the authority in rule-making and regulations of reserves.
#It allowed the [[General Land Office]] (GLO) to hire employees for the necessary administrative tasks and opened the reserves for public use.
#It specifically stated the criteria for new forest reserve designations, which were [[timber]] production, [[Drainage basin|watershed]] protection and forest protection.
#It gave the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) the responsibility for mapping the reserves.
This last item gave two separate branches of the Department of Interior responsibility-The GLO for the sale, claims and administration of the reserves and the USGS for the drawing of boundaries and land maps.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey pp.46-47&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
According to the Organic Act, the intention of the forest reservations was "to improve and protect the forest within the reservation,... securing favorable conditions of water flows, and to furnish a continuous supply of timber for the use and necessities of citizens of the United States." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foresthistory.org/Education/Curriculum/Activity/activ5/essay.htm  Foresthistory.org]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This law is one of two of the most important legislative events in US Forest Service history (the other being the [[Transfer Act of 1905]]). The nation now had  forest reserves and the means to protect and manage them. The basic elements of federal forestry were now established.&lt;ref&gt;Steen, Harold K. pp.36-37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior Department changes==
As instructed by the new law, a Division of Geography and Forestry was set up within the USGS. Henry Gannet was the new division's chief and produced surveys of the reserves that were of high quality and provided basic information necessary for effective management. These surveys, which included an atlas, were impressive, even today.&lt;ref&gt;Steen p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interior Department's Land Office section tried for a brief period to develop its capability to manage the reserves. Filibert Roth became the head of the General Land Office's "Division R"-the Forestry Division on November 15, 1901 and resigned two years later, in 1903.

[[Gifford Pinchot]], of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s Division of Forestry at this time, advocated for the removal of the reserves from Interior and placed under the Agriculture Department so that the forest reserves and the foresters would all be under one department. He also had a poor opinion of the Land Office due to "land office routine, political stupidity and wrong-headed points of view. "&lt;ref&gt;Steen pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;
A campaign was mounted toward this goal by Pinchot as well as the [[American Foresters Association]] and the [[Sierra Club]].
Finally, the effort paid off on Feb. 1905 when President Roosevelt signed into law the [[Transfer Act of 1905|Forest Transfer Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Steen p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Izaak Walton League lawsuit==
The [[Izaak Walton League]], a conservation group formed in 1922, that sought the complete abolishment of livestock grazing on national forest lands in the 1930s. The League's Los Angeles chapter petitioned Region 5 of the Forest Service to immediately and absolutely abolish all grazing permits of both sheep and cattle from California's national forest lands. The League's position was that sheep grazing was a costly mistake and a man-made hazard to forests and watersheds, that cattle grazing  had been too heavy and that both types of livestock hindered wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey p.271&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1973, the League successfully sued the Department of Agriculture over the clear-cut logging practices in the [[Monongahela National Forest]] as being contrary to the Organic Act of 1897 which stated that only "dead, physically mature and large growth trees "individually marked for cutting" could be sold. The appeals court upheld the lower court's decision on August 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey p. 468&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''People's Liberation Guerrilla Army''' (PLGA) is the armed wing of the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]], a [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)#Legal status|banned]] organisation in [[India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/06/23/stories/2009062358320100.htm | title=Centre bans CPI (Maoist) | work=The Hindu | date=23 June 2009 | accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to overthrow the [[government of India]] through [[people's war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-03-06/india/28147504_1_telugu-deepak-maoists-kishenji | title=Maoists will overthrow govt much before 2050 : Kishenji | work=The Times of India | date=6 March 2010 | accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The People's Liberation Guerrilla Army was founded on 2 December 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-17/india/35868361_1_mass-contact-programmes-people-s-liberation-guerrilla-army-plga | title=CPI (Maoist) marks PLGA anniversary with mass contact programmes | work=The Times of India | date=17 December 2012 | accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and known as the People's Guerrilla Army (PGA) by the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) People's War]], also known as the People's War Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/terroristoutfits/peoples_guerrilla_arms_left_wing_extremists.htm | title=People's Guerrilla Army, Left Wing Extremists | publisher=satp.org | accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PLGA was founded on the first death anniversary of their three Central Committee members, who were killed in an encounter in [[Koyyuru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/formation-of-plga-a-turning-point-in-the-maoist-movement/article931919.ece | title=Formation of PLGA a turning point in the Maoist movement | work=The Hindu | date=5 December 2010 | accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, when the People's War Group merged with the [[Maoist Communist Centre of India]] (MCCI) to form the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]], their respective armed wings also merged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2004/10/15/stories/2004101502561900.htm | title=PW, MCCI merge to form CPI (Maoist) | work=Business Line | date=15 October 2004 | accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the People's Guerrilla Army (the military wing of the People's War Group) and the People's Liberation Guerrilla Army (the military wing of MCCI) combined to form the People's Liberation Guerrilla Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/terroristoutfits/CPI_M.htm | title=Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) | publisher=satp.org | accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
The PLGA is controlled by the [[Central Military Commission]] of the CPI (Maoist).&lt;ref name="guerrilla warfare"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/article192205.ece?service=print | title=Dantawade a pointer to Maoist guerrilla warfare | work=The New Indian Express | date=8 April 2010 | accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analyses in September 2013, based on [[Maoist]]s' intercepted communication, suggested that the estimated number of PLGA members had decreased (from 10,000 − 12,000)&lt;ref name="T-September"&gt;{{citation |title=Top Maoist Leader Ganapathi Admits To Leadership Crisis In Party |url=http://www.tehelka.com/top-maoist-leader-ganapathi-admits-to-leadership-crisis-in-party/ |author=Ushinor Majumdar |publisher=[[Tehelka]] |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to 8,000 − 9,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reds in retreat |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/reds-in-retreat-113092700488_1.html |first1=R. |last1=Krishna Das |first2=Sahil |last2=Makkar |first3=Probal |last3=Basak |first4=Dillip |last4=Satapathy |date=27 September 2013 |accessdate=15 October 2013 |newspaper=[[Business Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently in March 2014, [[Gautam Navlakha]] has claimed that the PLGA's strength did not decrease but has increased, however, the guerrilla zone has been geographically reduced. He writes that "the number of companies and platoons of PLGA increased from 8 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] and 13 [[Platoon (military unit)|platoons]] in 2008 to 12 companies and more than 25 platoons, plus a supply platoon in 2013."&lt;ref name="Gautam"&gt;{{cite web| title=Ambush amplifies a struggle |url=http://sanhati.com/excerpted/9499/ |first=Gautam |last=Navlakha |authorlink=Gautam Navlakha |publisher=Sanhati |date=30 March 2014 |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the PLGA members are volunteers and they do not receive any wages.&lt;ref name="Walking with the Comrades"&gt;{{cite web | author-link=Arundhati Roy | url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?264738-0 | title=Walking with the Comrades | publisher=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]] | date=29 March 2010 | accessdate=15 October 2013 | last=Roy | first=Arundhati | quote=It is an entirely voluntary army.

'''Pico hydro''' is a term used for [[hydroelectric power]] generation of under 5&amp;nbsp;kW. These generators have proven to be useful in small, remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity{{snd}} for example, to power one or two fluorescent light bulbs and a TV or radio in 50 or so homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.t4cd.org/Resources/ICT_Resources/Projects/Pages/ICTProject_287.aspx |title = Micro Hydro Project |publisher = Technologies for Conservation &amp; Development project |date =  |work =  |accessdate = 6 September 2010 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090731064419/http://www.t4cd.org/Resources/ICT_Resources/Projects/Pages/ICTProject_287.aspx |archivedate = 31 July 2009 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even smaller turbines of 200–300&amp;nbsp;W may power a single home in a developing country with a drop of only one meter. Pico-hydro setups typically are [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-stream]], meaning that a reservoir of water is not created, only a small [[weir]] is common, pipes divert some of the flow, drop this down a gradient, and through the turbine before being exhausted back to the stream.

Like other hydroelectric and renewable source power generation, pollution and consumption of fossil fuels is reduced, though there is still typically an [[environmental economics|environmental cost]] to the manufacture of the generator and distribution methods.

With a growing [[Do it yourself|DIY]]-community and an increasing interest in environmentally friendly "[[green energy]]", some [[hobby|hobbyists]] have endeavored to build their own hydroelectric plants from old water mills, from kits, or from scratch.&lt;ref name="dorset"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archive.thisisdorset.net/2004/11/18/61215.html | title = OLD WATER MILLS IDEA FOR 'GREEN' ELECTRICITY | accessdate = August 5, 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060501154300/http://archive.thisisdorset.net/2004/11/18/61215.html | archivedate=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DIY-community has used abandoned water mills to mount a waterwheel and electrical generating components.&lt;ref name="green" /&gt; This approach has also been popularized in the TV-series ''[[It's Not Easy Being Green]]''.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{citeweb|url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060617083444/http://essentialspark.com/its_not_easy_being_green.aspx |title= Its not easy being green?}} &lt;/ref&gt; These are usually smaller turbines of ~5 kW or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/brochure_kleine_waterkracht.pdf | title = Watermills poweramounts depending on streams/rivers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130507125414/http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/brochure_kleine_waterkracht.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://de.green-acres.com/en/properties/3503a-ah0393.htm | title = 15kwh sometimes acquired, (yet not frequently) as a power output with converted watermills | publisher = De.green-acres.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navitron.org.uk/page.php?58 |title=Navitron's hydroelectric plants information page |publisher=Navitron.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the internet, the community is now able to obtain plans to construct DIY-water turbines,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.green-trust.org/hydro.htm |title=Hydroelectric plants DIY plans |publisher=Green-trust.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first1 = Paul | last1 = Cunningham | first2 = Ian | last2 = Woofenden |url = http://www.homepower.com/view/?file=HP117_pg40_Cunningham | title = Simplified overview of diy hydroplants installation | publisher = Homepower.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.villageearth.org/pages/Appropriate_Technology/ATSourcebook/|title=Appropriate Technology Sourcebook |accessdate=August 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080914160956/http://www.villageearth.org:80/pages/Appropriate_Technology/ATSourcebook/ | archivedate=January 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a growing trend toward building them for domestic requirements. The DIY-hydroelectric plants are now being used both in developed countries and in [[developing countries]], to power residences and small businesses. Two examples of pico hydro power can be found in the towns of Kithamba and Thimba in the [[Central Province (Kenya)|Central Province]] of [[Kenya]]. These produce 1.1 kW and 2.2 kW, respectively.  Local residents were trained to maintain the hydro schemes. The pico hydro sites in Kenya won [[Ashden Awards]] for Sustainable Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/itdg |title = Ashden Award for Pico hydro power in Kenya |publisher = Ashden Awards   |date =  |work =  |accessdate= 6 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] system of [[cistern]]s and small generators, pico hydro may also be effective for "closed loop" home systems.

==Manufacturers==
In Vietnam, several Chinese manufacturers have sold pico-powerplants at prices as low as $20–70 for a powerplant of 300–500&amp;nbsp;W. However, the devices sold are said to be low in quality and may damage connected equipment if connected improperly.&lt;ref name="vietnam-pico"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTEAPASTAE/Resources/ASTAE-Benefits-of-Rural-Electrification-Vietnam.pdf |title = Welfare Impacts of Rural Electrification: Evidence from Vietnam |author1=Shahidur R. Khandker |author2=Douglas F. Barnes |author3=Hussain Samad |author4=Nguyen Huu Minh |publisher =  World Bank|date =September 2008  |work =  |accessdate= 6 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam Redfield of the [[Appropriate Infrastructure Development Group]] (AIDG) has developed a pico-hydro generator made from common [[PVC]] pipe and a modified Toyota [[alternator]] housed in a [[five gallon bucket]]. The generator was developed to provide power to communities without access to the electricity grid in developing countries. Envisioned as an energy source to charge cell phones, provide lighting and charge batteries, the generator is designed to be made by artisans with basic skills and can be built for less than $150.00. The Toyota alternator used in the generator is converted to a permanent magnet alternator allowing it to generate power at low [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]s. The Five Gallon Bucket Hydroelectric Generator was the subject of a work group at the 2008 [[International Development Design Summit]] (IDDS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During the Summer of 2013, an energy project in [[Abra Malaga, Peru]] was completed using the bucket generator.&lt;ref name="5gal"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.five-gallon-bucket-hydroelectric.org |title= Five Gallon Bucket Hydroelectric Generator}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A website has been put together as a forum for ideas and further iterations of the generator that includes a ''build manual''.&lt;ref name="Bucket-Hydro"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.engineeringforchange.org/static/content/Energy/S00070/5%20Gallon%20Bucket%20Build%20Manual.pdf |title = Five Gallon Bucket Hydroelectric Generator Build Manual |author = Sam Redfield  |publisher = Engineering for Change  |date =  |work = Appropriate Infrastructure Development Group  |accessdate= 2012-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common [[Centrifugal pump|centrifugal water pumps]], can be operated in reverse to act as turbines. While these machines rarely have optimum hydraulic characteristics when operated as turbines, their availability and low cost makes them attractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esha.be/fileadmin/esha_files/documents/workshops/hidroenergia_2008/HE08_Presentations/day_2/3._Arthur_Williams_-_The_performance_of_centrifugal_pumps_as_turbines_and_influence_of_pump_geometry.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Performance of Centrifugal Pumps as Turbines and Influence of Pump Geometry |author=Arthur Williams |publisher=Esha.be |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission distance==
If the power will be used more than 30 meters (100 feet) from the generator, then the transmission distance may be an important consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homepower.com/articles/microhydro-power/design-installation/electric-side-hydro-power|title=The Electric Side of Hydro Power|work=homepower.com|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many small systems use [[Alternator (automotive)|automotive alternators]] producing 12&amp;nbsp;VDC, and possibly charging a battery. For example, a 12&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|V]] system that produces 1&amp;nbsp;kW of power has a flow of 80&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere|A]] and the wire size is 4-gauge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electrical.about.com/od/wiringcircuitry/a/electwiresizes.htm|title=Determining Proper Electrical Wiring Size|author=Timothy Thiele|work=About.com Home|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost to run two strands of wire 1000' is $2400(US).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homedepot.com/p/Southwire-4-Stranded-THHN-Black-By-the-Foot-20499099/204632882|title=Southwire 4 Stranded THHN Black (By-the-Foot)-20499099 - The Home Depot|author=Donnie|date=29 May 2015|work=The Home Depot|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid such a large wire cost a higher voltage and lower current is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homepower.com/articles/microhydro-power/design-installation/electric-side-hydro-power/page/0/1|title=The Electric Side of Hydro Power: Page 2 of 3|work=homepower.com|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a 240&amp;nbsp;VAC alternator is used instead the flow is only 4&amp;nbsp;A over 1000' of 18 gauge wire costing $180(US).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homedepot.com/p/Cerrowire-50-ft-18-Gauge-2-Conductor-Thermostat-Wire-210-1002B/202206424#specifications|title=Cerrowire 50 ft. 18-Gauge 2 Conductor Thermostat Wire-210-1002B - The Home Depot|author=CraiginPA|date=19 February 2015|work=The Home Depot|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of wire resulted in North America using 120/240&amp;nbsp;VAC after DC voltage lost the [[War of Currents]] in the late 1800s. Another approach to reduce wire costs is to have a 12&amp;nbsp;VDC alternator with a short high [[Electric current|current]] connection to an [[Power inverter|inverter]] outputting 120&amp;nbsp;VAC or 240&amp;nbsp;VAC at a much lower current on a long length of thinner wire.

A '''police cadet''' can refer either to a trainee police officer or to a member of a youth organisation in which young people learn about and/or participate in law enforcement and police work.

Many police departments in the United States offer police cadet programmes, as do a number of [[Police cadets in the United Kingdom#Volunteer Police Cadets (youth organisation)|police forces in the United Kingdom]].

{{Revolution sidebar}}
'''Rebellion''', '''uprising''', or '''insurrection''' is a refusal of obedience or order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cyclopædia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political ... |last=Lalor |first=John Joseph |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1884 |publisher=Rand, McNally |location= |isbn= |pages=632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the open resistance against the orders of an established [[authority]]. The term comes from the Latin verb ''rebellō,'' "I renew war" (from ''re-'' ("again") + ''bellō'' ("I wage war/I revolt").  The rebel is the individual that partakes in rebellion or rebellious activities, particularly when armed. Thus, the term ''rebellion'' also refers to the ensemble of rebels in a state of revolt.

A rebellion originates from a sentiment of indignation and disapproval of a situation and then manifests itself by the refusal to submit or to obey the authority responsible for this situation. Rebellion can be individual or collective, [[peace]]ful ([[civil disobedience]], [[civil resistance]], and [[nonviolent resistance]]) or [[violent]] ([[terrorism]], [[sabotage]] and [[guerrilla warfare]].) {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In political terms, rebellion and revolt are often distinguished by their different aims. If rebellion generally seeks to evade and/or gain concessions from an oppressive power, a revolt seeks to overthrow and destroy that power, as well as its accompanying laws. The goal of rebellion is resistance while a '''revolt''' seeks a revolution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  As power shifts relative to the external adversary, or power shifts within a mixed [[coalition]], or positions harden or soften on either side, an insurrection may seesaw between the two forms.

== Causes ==

=== Macro approach ===
The following theories broadly build on the Marxist interpretation of rebellion. They explore the causes of rebellion from a wide lens perspective.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} Rebellion is studied, in Theda Skocpol's words, by analyzing "objective relationships and conflicts among variously situated groups and nations, rather than the interests, outlooks, or ideologies of particular actors in revolutions".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=291}}

==== Marxist insight ====
[[Karl Marx]]'s analysis of revolutions sees such expression of [[political violence]] not as anomic, episodic outbursts of discontents but rather the symptomatic expression of a particular set of objective but fundamentally contradicting class-based relations of power. Indeed, the central tenet of Marxist philosophy, as expressed in [[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]], is the analysis of society's mode of production (technology and labor) concomitant with the ownership of productive institutions and the division of profit. Marx writes about "the hidden structure of society" that must be elucidated through an examination of "the direct relationship of the owners of the conditions of production to the direct producers". The mismatch, between one mode of production, between the social forces and the social ownership of the production, is at the origin of the revolution.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=7}} The inner imbalance within these modes of production is derived from the conflicting modes of organization, such as capitalism within feudalism, or more appropriately socialism within capitalism. The dynamics engineered by these class frictions help class consciousness root itself in the collective imaginary. For example, the development of the bourgeoisie class went from oppressed merchant class to urban independence, eventually gaining enough power to represent the state as a whole. Social movements, thus, are determined by an exogenous set of circumstances. The proletariat must also, according to Marx, go through the same process of self-determination which can only be achieved by friction against the bourgeoisie. In Marx's theory revolutions are the "locomotives of history", it is because rebellion has for ultimate goal to overthrow the ruling class and its antiquated mode of production. Later, rebellion attempts to replace it with a new system of political economy, one that is better suited to the new ruling class, thus enabling societal progress. The cycle of rebellion, thus, replaces one mode of production by another through the constant class friction.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=8}}

==== Ted Gurr: Roots of political violence ====
In his book ''Why Men Rebel'', [[Ted Robert Gurr|Ted Gurr]] looks at the roots of political violence itself applied to a rebellion framework. He defines political violence as: "all collective attacks within a political community against the political [[Political regime|regime]], its actors [...] or its policies. The concept represents a set of events, a common property of which is the actual or threatened use of violence".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=3}} Gurr sees in violence a voice of anger that manifests itself against the established order. More precisely, individuals become angry when they feel what Gurr labels as [[Relative deprivation thesis|relative deprivation]], meaning the feeling of getting less than one is entitled to. He labels it formally as the "perceived discrepancy between value expectations and value capabilities".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=37}} Gurr differentiates between three types of relative deprivation:
# ''Decremental deprivation'': one's capacities' decrease when expectations remain high. One example of this is the proliferation and thus depreciation of  the value of higher education.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=47}}
# ''Aspirational Deprivation'': one's capacities stay the same when expectations rise. An example would be a first generation college student lacking the contacts and network to obtain a higher paying job while watching her better-prepared colleagues bypass her.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=52}}
# ''Progressive deprivation'': expectation and capabilities increase but the former cannot keep up. A good example would be an automotive worker being increasingly marginalized by the automatisation of the assembly line.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=53}}
Anger is thus comparative. One of his key insight is that "The potential for collective violence varies strongly with the intensity and scope of relative deprivation among members of a collectivity".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=24}} This means that different individuals within society will have different propensities to rebel based on their particular internalization of their situation. As such, Gurr differentiates between three types of political violence:{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=11}}
# ''Turmoil'' when only the mass population encounters relative deprivation;
# ''Conspiracy'' when the population but especially the elite encounters relative deprivation;
# ''Internal War'', which includes revolution. In this case, the degree of organization is much higher than turmoil, and the revolution is intrinsically spread to all sections of society, unlike the conspiracy.

==== Charles Tilly: Centrality of collective action ====
In ''From Mobilization to Revolution'', [[Charles Tilly]] argues that political violence is a normal and endogenous reaction to competition for power between different groups within society. "Collective violence", Tilly writes, "is the product of just normal processes of competition among groups in order to obtain the power and implicitly to fulfill their desires”.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=54}} He proposes two models to analyze political violence:
# The ''polity'' model takes into account government and groups jockeying for control over power. Thus, both the organizations holding power and the ones challenging them are included.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=ch3}} Tilly labels those two groups "members" and "challengers". 
# The ''mobilization'' model aims to describe the behavior of one single party to the political struggle for power. Tilly further divides the model in two sub-categories, one that deals with the internal dynamics of the group, and the other that is concerned with the "external relations" of the entity with other organizations and/or the government. According to Tilly, the cohesiveness of a group mainly relies on the strength of common interests and the degree of organization. Thus, to answer Gurr, anger alone does not automatically create political violence. Political action is contingent on the capacity to organize and unite. It is far from irrational and spontaneous.
Revolutions are included in this theory, although they remain for Tilly particularly extreme since the challenger(s) aim for nothing less than full control over power.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=ch7}} The "revolutionary moment occurs when the population needs to choose to obey either the government or an alternative body who is engaged with the government in a zero sum game. This is what Tilly calls "multiple sovereignty".{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=213}} The success of a revolutionary movement hinges on "the formation of coalitions between members of the polity and the contenders advancing exclusive alternative claims to control over Government.".{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=213}}

==== Chalmers Johnson and societal values ====
For Chalmers Johnson, rebellions are not so much the product of political violence or collective action but in "the analysis of viable, functioning societies".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=3}} In a quasi-biological manner, Johnson sees revolutions as symptoms of pathologies within the societal fabric. A healthy society, meaning a "value-coordinated social system"{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=36}} does not experience political violence. Johnson's equilibrium is at the intersection between the need for society adapt to changes but at the same time firmly grounded in selective fundamental values. The legitimacy of a political order, he posits, relies exclusively on its compliance with these societal values and in its capacity to integrate and adapt to any change. Rigidity is, in other words, inadmissible. Johnson writes "to make a revolution is to accept violence for the purpose of causing the system to change; more exactly, it is the purposive implementation of a strategy of violence in order to effect a change in social structure".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=57}} The aim of a revolution is to re-align a political order on new societal values introduced by an externality that the system itself has not been able to process. Rebellions automatically must face a certain amount of coercion because by becoming "de-synchronized", the now illegitimate political order will have to use coercion to maintain its position. A simplified example would be the French Revolution when the Parisian Bourgeoisie did not recognize the core values and outlook of the King as synchronized with its own orientations. More than the King itself, what really sparked the violence was the uncompromising intransigence of the ruling class. Johnson emphasizes "the necessity of investigating a system's value structure and its problems in order to conceptualize the revolutionary situation in any meaningful way".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=32}}

==== Theda Skocpol and the Autonomy of the State ====
Skocpol introduces the concept of the social revolution, to be contrasted with a political revolution. While the later aims to change the polity, the former is "rapid, basic transformations of a society's state and class structures; and they are accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=4}} Social revolutions are grassroots movement by nature because they do more than change the modalities of power, they aim to transform the fundamental social structure of society. As a corollary, this means that some "revolutions" may cosmetically change the organization of the monopoly over power without engineering any true change in the social fabric of society. Her analysis is limited to studying the French, Russian, and Chinese revolutions. Skocpol identifies three stages of the revolution in these cases (which she believes can be extrapolated and generalized), each accordingly accompanied by specific structural factors which in turn influence the social results of the political action. 
# ''The Collapse of the Old-Regime State'': this is an automatic consequence of certain structural conditions. She highlights the importance of international military and economic competition as well as the pressure of the misfunctioning of domestic affairs. More precisely, she sees the breakdown of the governing structures of society influenced by two theoretical actors, the "landed upper class" and the "imperial state".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=49}} Both could be considered as "partners in exploitation" but in reality competed for resources: the state (monarchs) seek to build up military and economic power to ascertain their geopolitical influence. The upper class works in a logic of [[profit maximization]], meaning preventing as much as possible the state to extract resources. All three revolutions occurred, Skocpol argues, because states failed to be able to "mobilize extraordinary resources from the society and implement in the process reforms requiring structural transformations".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=50}} The apparently contradicting policies were mandated by a unique set of geopolitical competition and modernization. "Revolutionary political crises occurred because of the unsuccessful attempts of the Bourbon, Romanov, and Manchu regimes to cope with foreign pressures."{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=50}} Skocpol further concludes "the upshot was the disintegration of centralized administrative and military machineries that had theretofore provided the sole unified bulwark of social and political order".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=51}}
# ''Peasant Uprisings'': more than simply a challenge by the landed upper class in a difficult context, the state needs to be challenged by mass peasant uprisings in order to fall. These uprisings must be aimed not at the political structures ''per se'' but at the upper class itself, so that the political revolution becomes a social one as well. Skocpol quotes Barrington Moore who famously wrote: "peasants [...] provided the dynamite to bring down the old building".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=112}} Peasant uprisings are more effective depending on two given structural socioeconomic conditions: the level of autonomy (from both an economic and political point of view) peasant communities enjoy, and the degree of direct control the upper class on local politics. In other words, peasants must be able to have some degree of agency in order to be able to rebel. If the coercive structures of the state and/or the landowners keep a very close check on peasant activity, then there is no space to forment dissent. 
# ''Societal Transformation'': this is the third and decisive step after the state organization has been seriously weakened and peasant revolts become widespread against landlords. The paradox of the three revolutions Skocpol studies is that stronger centralized and bureaucratic states emerge after the revolts.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=162}} The exact parameters depend, again, on structural factors as opposed to voluntarist factors: in Russia, the new state found most support in the industrial base, rooting itself in cities. In China, most of the support for the revolt had been in the countryside, thus the new polity was grounded in rural areas. In France, the peasantry was not organized enough, and the urban centers not potent enough so that the new state was not firmly grounded in anything, partially explaining its artificiality. 
Here is a summary of the causes and consequences of social revolutions in these three countries, according to Skocpol:{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=155}}

=== Microfoundational evidence on causes ===
The following theories are all based on [[Mancur Olson]]'s work in ''[[The Logic of Collective Action]]'',a 1965 book that conceptualizes the inherent [[Tragedy of the commons|problem]] with an activity that has concentrated costs and diffuse benefits. In this case, the benefits of rebellion are seen as a [[public good]], meaning one that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous.{{sfn|Olson|1965|p=9}}  Indeed, the political benefits are generally shared by all in society if a rebellion is successful, not just the individuals that have partaken in the rebellion itself. Olson thus challenges the assumption that simple interests in common are all that is necessary for [[Collective action theory|collective action]]. In fact, he argues the "[[Free rider problem|free rider]]" possibility, a term that means to reap the benefits without paying the price, will deter rational individuals from collective action. That is, unless there is a clear benefit, a rebellion will not happen en masse. Thus, Olson shows that "selective incentives", only made accessible to individuals participating in the collective effort, can solve the free rider problem.{{sfn|Olson|1965|p=76}}

==== ''The Rational Peasant'' ====
{{Main article|The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam}}

Samuel L. Popkin builds on Olson's argument in ''The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam.'' His theory is based on the figure of a hyper rational peasant that bases his decision to join (or not) a rebellion uniquely on a cost-benefit analysis. This formalist view of the collective action problem stresses the importance of individual economic rationality and self-interest: a peasant, according to Popkin, will disregard the ideological dimension of a social movement and focus instead on whether or not it will bring any practical benefit to him. According to Popkin, peasant society is based on a precarious structure of economic instability. Social norms, he writes, are "malleable, renegotiated, and shifting in accord with considerations of power and strategic interaction among individuals"{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=22}} Indeed, the constant insecurity and inherent risk to the peasant condition, due to the peculiar nature of the patron-client relationship that binds the peasant to his landowner, forces the peasant to look inwards when he has a choice to make. Popkin argues that peasants rely on their "private, family investment for their long run security and that they will be interested in short term gain vis-à-vis the village. They will attempt to improve their long-run security by moving to a position with higher income and less variance".{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=23}} Popkin stresses this "investor logic" that one may not expect in agrarian societies, usually seen as pre-capitalist communities where traditional social and power structures prevent the accumulation of capital. Yet, the selfish determinants of collective action are, according to Popkin, a direct product of the inherent instability of peasant life. The goal of a laborer, for example, will be to move to a tenant position, then smallholder, then landlord; where there is less variance and more income. Voluntarism is thus non-existent in such communities.

Popkin singles out four variables that impact individual participation:
# Contribution to the expenditure of resources: collective action has a cost in terms of contribution, and especially if it fails (an important consideration with regards to rebellion) 
# Rewards : the direct (more income) and indirect (less oppressive central state) rewards for collective action 
# Marginal impact of the peasant's contribution to the success of collective action
# Leadership "viability and trust" : to what extent the resources pooled will be effectively used.
Without any moral commitment to the community, this situation will engineer free riders. Popkin argues that selective incentives are necessary to overcome this problem.{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=34}}

===== Opportunity cost of rebellion =====
Political Scientist Christopher Blattman and World Bank economist Laura Alston identify rebellious activity as an "occupational choice".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=22}} They draw a parallel between criminal activity and rebellion, arguing that the risks and potential payoffs an individual must calculate when making the decision to join such a movement remains similar between the two activities. In both cases, only a selected few reap important benefits, while most of the members of the group do not receive similar payoffs.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}} The choice to rebel is inherently linked with its opportunity cost, namely what an individual is ready to give up in order to rebel. Thus, the available options beside rebellious or criminal activity matter just as much as the rebellion itself when the individual makes the decision. Blattman and Alston, however, recognize that "a poor person's best strategy" might be both rebellion illicit and legitimate activities at the same time.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}} Individuals, they argue, can often have a varied "portofolio" of activities, suggesting that they all operate on a rational, profit maximizing logic. The authors conclude that the best way to fight rebellion is to increase its opportunity cost, both by more enforcement but also by minimizing the potential material gains of a rebellion.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}}

===== Selective incentives based on group membership =====
The decision to join a rebellion can be based on the prestige and social status associated with membership in the rebellious group. More than material incentives for the individual, rebellions offer their members [[club good]]s, [[public good]]s that are reserved only for the members inside that group. Economist [[Eli Berman]] and Political Scientist David D. Laitin's study of radical religious groups show that the appeal of club goods can help explain individual membership. Berman and Laitin discuss [[Suicide attack|suicide]] operations, meaning acts that have the highest cost for an individual. They find that in such a framework, the real danger to an organization is not volunteering but preventing defection. Furthermore, the decision to enroll in such high stakes organization can be rationalized.{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1965}} Berman and Laitin show that religious organizations supplant the state when it fails to provide an acceptable quality of public goods such a public safety, basic infrastructure, access to utilities, or schooling.{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1944}} Suicide operations "can be explained as a costly signal of “commitment” to the community".{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1943}} They further note "Groups less adept at extracting signals of commitment (sacrifices) may not be able to consistently enforce incentive compatibility."{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1954}} Thus, rebellious groups can organize themselves to ''ask'' of members proof of commitment to the cause. Club goods serve not so much to coax individuals into joining but to prevent defection.

===== Greed vs grievance model =====
{{Main article|Greed versus grievance}}
World Bank economists [[Paul Collier]] and Anke Hoeffler compare two dimensions of incentives:
# [[Greed]] rebellion: "motivated by predation of the rents from primary commodity exports, subject to an economic calculus of costs and a military survival constraint".{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}}
# [[Grievance]] rebellion: "motivated by hatreds which might be intrinsic to ethnic and religious differences, or reflected objective resentments such as domination by an [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] majority, political repression, or [[economic inequality]]".{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}} The two main sources of grievance are political exclusion and inequality.
Vollier and Hoeffler find that the model based on grievance variables systematically fails to predict past conflicts, while the model based on greed performs well. The authors posit that the high cost of risk to society is not taken into account seriously by the grievance model: individuals are fundamentally risk-adverse. However, they allow that conflicts create grievances, which in turn can become risk factors. Contrary to established beliefs, they also find that a multiplicity of ethnic communities make society safer, since individuals will be automatically more cautious, at the opposite of the grievance model predictions.{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}} Finally, the authors also note that the grievances expressed by members of the [[diaspora]] of a community in turmoil has an important on the continuation of violence.{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=27}} Both greed and grievance thus need to be included in the reflection.

==== ''The Moral Economy of the Peasant'' ====
{{Main article|The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia}}

Spearheaded by political scientist and anthropologist [[James C. Scott]] in his  book ''[[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of the Peasant]]'', the [[moral economy]] school considers moral variables such as social norms, moral values, interpretation of justice, and conception of duty to the community as the prime influencers of the decision to rebel. This perspective still adheres to Olson's framework, but it considers different variables to enter the cost/benefit analysis: the individual is still believed to be rational, albeit not on material but moral grounds.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=6}}

===== Early conceptualization: E. P. Thompson and bread riots in England =====
Before being fully conceptualized by Scott, British historian [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson]] was the first to use the term "moral economy" in ''Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=E. P.|date=1971-01-01|title=The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century|jstor=650244|journal=Past &amp; Present|issue=50|pages=76–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, he discussed English bread riots, regular, localized form of rebellion by English peasants all through the 18th century. Such events, Thompson argues, have been routinely dismissed as "riotous", with the connotation of being disorganized, spontaneous, undirected, and undisciplined. In other words, anecdotal. The reality, he suggests, was otherwise: such riots involved a coordinated peasant action, from the pillaging of food convoys to the seizure of grain shops. Here, while a scholar such as Popkin would have argued that the peasants were trying to gain material benefits (crudely: more food), Thompson sees a legitimization factor, meaning "a belief that [the peasants] were defending traditional rights and customs".  Thompson goes on to write: "[the riots were] legitimized by the assumptions of an older moral economy, which taught the immorality of any unfair method of forcing up the price of provisions by profiteering upon the necessities of the people". Later, reflecting on this work, Thompson would also write: "My object of analysis was the ''mentalité'', or, as I would prefer, the political culture, the expectations, traditions, and indeed, superstitions of the working population most frequently involved in actions in the market".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Customs-Common-Studies-Traditional-Popular/dp/1565840747|title=Customs in Common: Studies in Traditional Popular Culture|last=Thompson|first=E. P.|date=1993-08-01|publisher=The New Press|isbn=9781565840744|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition between a traditional, paternalist, and the communitarian set of values clashing with the inverse liberal, capitalist, and market-derived ethics is central to explain rebellion.

===== James C. Scott and the formalization of the moral economy argument=====
In [[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia]], James C. Scott looks at the impact of exogenous economic and political shocks on peasant communities in Southeast Asia. Scott finds that peasants are mostly in the business of surviving and producing enough to subsist.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=15}} Therefore, any extractive regime needs to respect this careful equilibrium. He labels this phenomenon the "subsistence ethic".{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=13}} A landowner operating in such communities is seen to have the moral duty to prioritize the peasant's subsistence over his constant benefit. According to Scott, the powerful colonial state accompanied by market capitalism did not respect this fundamental hidden law in peasant societies. Rebellious movements occurred as the reaction to an emotional grief, a moral outrage.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=193}}

===== Other non-material incentives=====
[[Chris Blattman|Blattman]] and Ralston recognize the importance of immaterial selective incentives, such as anger, outrage, and injustice ("grievance") in the roots of rebellions. These variable,s they argue, are far from being irrational, as they are sometimes presented. They identify three main types of grievance arguments:
# ''Intrinsic [[incentive]]s'' holds that "[[injustice]] or perceived transgression generates an intrinsic willingness to punish or seek retribution".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=24}} More than material rewards, individuals are naturally and automatically prompted to fight for justice if they feel they have been wronged. The [[ultimatum game]] is an excellent illustration: player one receives $10 and must split it with another player who doesn't get the chance to determine how much he receives, but only if the deal is made or not (if he refuses, everyone loses their money). Rationally, player 2 should take whatever the deal is because it is better in absolute term ($1 more remains $1 more). However, player 2 is most likely unwilling to accept less than 2 or 2 dollars, meaning that they are willing to pay a-$2 for justice to be respected. This game, according to Blattman and Ralston, represents "the expressive pleasure people gain from punishing an injustice".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=24}}
# ''[[Loss aversion]]'' holds that "people tend to evaluate their satisfaction relative to a reference point, and that they are 'loss adverse".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}} Individuals prefer not losing over the risky strategy of making gains. There is a substantial [[Subjectivity|subjective]] part to this, however, as some may realize alone and decide that they are comparatively less well off than a neighbor, for example. To "fix" this gap, individuals will in turn be ready to take great risks so as to not enshrine a loss.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}}
# ''Frustration-aggression'': this model holds that the immediate emotional reactions to highly stressful environments do not obey to any "direct utility benefit but rather a more impulsive and emotional response to a threat".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}} There are limits to this theory: violent action is to a large extent a product of goals by an individual which are in turn determined by a set of [[preference]]s.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=26}} Yet, this approach shows that contextual elements like economic precarity have a non-negligible impact on the conditions of the decisions to rebel at minimum.

== Recruitment ==
Stathis N. Kalyvas, a political science professor at Yale University, argues that political violence is heavily influenced by hyperlocal socio-economic factors, from the mundane traditional family rivalries to repressed grudges.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}} Rebellion, or any sort of political violence, are not binary conflicts but must be understood as interactions between public and private identities and actions. The "convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives" make studying and theorizing rebellion a very complex affair, at the intersection between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=475}}
Kalyvas argues that we often try to group political conflicts according to two structural paradigms:
# The idea that political violence, and more specifically rebellion, is characterized by a complete breakdown of authority and an anarchic state. This is inspired by Thomas Hobbes' views. The approach sees rebellion as being motivated by greed and loot, using violence to break down the power structures of society.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}}
# The idea that all political violence is inherently motivated by an abstract group of loyalties and beliefs, "whereby the political enemy becomes a private adversary only by virtue of prior collective and impersonal enmity".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}} Violence is thus not a "man to man" affair as much as a :state to state" struggle, if not an "idea vs idea" conflict.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}}
Kalyvas' key insight is that the central vs periphery dynamic is fundamental in political conflicts. Any individual actor, Kalyvas posits, enters into a calculated ''alliance'' with the collective.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Rebellions thus cannot be analyzed in molar categories, nor should we assume that individuals are automatically in line with the rest of the actors simply by virtue of ideological, religious, ethnic, or class cleavage. The agency is located both within the collective and in the individual, in the universal and the local.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Kalyvas writes: "Alliance entails a ''transaction'' between supralocal and local actors, whereby the former supply the later with external muscle, thus allowing them to win decisive local advantage, in exchange the former rely on local conflicts to recruit and motivate supporters and obtain local control, resources, and information- even when their ideological agenda is opposed to localism".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Individuals will thus aim to use the rebellion in order to gain some sort of local advantage, while the collective actors will aim to gain power. Violence is a mean as opposed to a goal, according to Kalyvas.

The greater takeaway from this central/local analytical lens is that violence is not an anarchic tactic or a manipulation by an ideology, but a conversation between the two. Rebellions are "concatenations of multiple and often disparate local cleavages, more or less loosely arranged around the master cleavage".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Any pre-conceived explanation or theory of a conflict must not be placated on a situation, lest one will construct a reality that adapts itself to his pre-conceived idea. Kalyvas thus argues that political conflict is not always political in the sense that they cannot be reduced to a certain discourse, decisions, or ideologies from the "center" of collective action. Instead, the focus must be on "local cleavages and intracommunity dynamics".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=487}} Furthermore, rebellion is not "a mere mechanism that opens up the floodgates to random and anarchical private violence".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=487}} Rather, it is the result of a careful and precarious alliance between local motivations and collective vectors to help the individual cause.

{{expand section| Correcting the abstractions and anecdotes, and write a comprehensive overview of the classification of rebellion. |date=May 2016}}

An armed but limited rebellion is an insurrection,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1989. Insurrection: "The action of rising in arms or open resistance against established authority or governmental restraint; with pl., an instance of this, an armed rising, a revolt; an incipient or limited rebellion."&lt;/ref&gt; and if the established government does not recognize the rebels as [[belligerent]]s then they are insurgents and the revolt is an [[insurgency]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1989. Insurgent "One who rises in revolt against constituted authority; a rebel who is not recognized as a belligerent."&lt;/ref&gt; In a larger conflict the rebels may be recognized as [[belligerent]]s without their government being recognized by the established government, in which case the conflict becomes a [[civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Kermit L.''The Oxford Guide to United States Supreme Court Decisions'', Oxford University Press US, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-513924-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-513924-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=nO093wNz1PoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA246&amp;dq=insurrection+civil+war&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 pp. 246,247] "In supporting Lincoln on this issue, the Supreme Court upheld his theory of the Civil War as an insurrection against the United States government that could be suppressed according to the rules of war. In this way the United States was able to fight the war as if it were an international war, without actually having to recognize the ''de jure'' existence of the Confederate government."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Civil resistance]] movements have often aimed at, and brought about, the fall of a government or head of state, and in these cases could be considered a form of rebellion. In many of these cases the opposition movement saw itself not only as nonviolent, but also as upholding their country's constitutional system against a government that was unlawful, for example if it had refused to acknowledge its defeat in an election. Thus the term "rebel" does not always capture the element in some of these movements of acting as a defender of legality and constitutionalism.&lt;ref&gt;See the chapters by specialists on the various above-cited cases of civil resistance in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of terms that are associated with ''rebel'' and ''rebellion''. They range from those with positive connotations to those with pejorative connotations. Examples include:
* [[Civil resistance]], [[civil disobedience]], and [[nonviolent resistance]] which do not include violence or paramilitary force .{{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}

* Armed [[resistance movement]], which is carried out by [[Resistance movement#Freedom fighter|freedom fighters]], often against an occupying foreign power {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* Revolt, a term that is sometimes used for a more localized rebellions rather than a general uprising {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* [[Revolution]], which is carried out by radicals, usually meant to overthrow the current [[government]] {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3029">'''Sasine''' in [[Scots law]] is the delivery of [[Feudalism|feudal]] property, typically land.

Feudal property means immovable property, and includes everything that naturally goes with the property. For land, that would include such things as buildings, trees, and underground minerals. A superior (e.g., a [[heritor]]) might authorise his agent or factor to give possession of his property to someone else through a document known as a "precept of sasine".

Over time, sasine came to be used in common speech as a reference to the deed or document recording the transfer, rather than to the transfer itself. Hence phrases such as "to give sasines", "to deliver sasines", "to receive sasines", "to take sasines".

Alternate spellings: ''seizin'', ''seisin'', ''sasin'', ''seasin'', ''sasing'', ''seasing'', ''sesin'', ''seasin'', ''sesine'', ''seasine'', ''saisine''.&lt;ref&gt;

==Additional explanations==
A [[Register of Sasines]] was created in every locality by the [[Registration Act 1617]]. It functions to this day on a national level as the [[Registers of Scotland#General Register of Sasines|General Register of Sasines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Transfers of property were originally by symbolic delivery, by handing over a clump of ground or a stone or similar object on the property itself, and then registering the "deed of conveyance" in the local "Register of Sasines". The term 'Instrument of Sasine' was actually the recording of the event of the symbolic delivery of the property as witnessed, and minuted, by a Court Official in attendance for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Registers of Scotland&lt;/ref&gt; Actual ''sasines'' on the land itself were made unnecessary by an act of 1845. The "instrument of ''sasines''" was superseded by the recording of the conveyance with a "warrant of registration" by an act of 1858.

The corresponding term in English law was [[livery of seisin]] (but not the term [[seisin]]).

The '''Scottish Council for Research in Education''' (SCRE) was set up by the Scottish teachers’ union (The [[Educational Institute of Scotland]], EIS) and the [[Association of Directors of Education]] in 1928. At that time, there were no similar organisations anywhere in the world {{cn|date=February 2013}}. The Council itself consisted of some 60 members drawn from a wide range of bodies with an interest in education {{cn|date=February 2013}}. This Council appointed a director and arranged for some basic funding to come from government local authorities, but the EIS provided free accommodation and secretarial assistance. For more than 20 years, most of the work was carried out by groups of teachers on a voluntary basis.

Throughout these years and on into the 1980s Council staff and associates made distinguished contributions to educational research, often setting world standards. Two key reports were the reports of 1921&lt;ref name="SCRE1933"&gt;Scottish Council for Research in Education. (1933). ''The intelligence of Scottish children: A national survey of an age-group''. University of London Press. London&lt;/ref&gt; and 1947
&lt;ref name="SCRE1958"&gt;Scottish Council for Research in Education. (1958). ''Educational and other aspects of the 1947 Scottish Mental Survey''. University of London Press. London&lt;/ref&gt; nationwide assessment of age-11 IQ in Scotland.

The authors of the Council's early publications make up a who's who of the greats in this field — [[Godfrey Thomson]], [[Drever]], [[Philip E. Vernon|P.E.Vernon]], McClelland and Boyd. These men influenced educational thinking throughout the world. They found worthy successors in later years — Maxwell, Fraser, Clark, Nisbet, Hope, Dockrell, [[Patricia Broadfoot]], Spencer, [[John Raven]], [[Ian Deary]].

In later years the Council's research programme came more and more under government control with the Council itself finally being disbanded and the few remaining staff moved to an all-but non-existent renamed Scottish Center for Educational research within the Faculty of Education of [[Glasgow University]]. Its website was likewise disbanded. For this reason a complete list of the publications of the Council is no longer available.

A short but comprehensive account of the Council's work has been contributed by Powell and an earlier, but fuller, account by Morris.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37641">[[File:Bush reagan.jpg|thumb|right|Presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] (left) and [[George H. W. Bush]] (right) issued significant numbers of signing statements containing constitutional objections to laws passed by Congress.]]
A '''signing statement''' is a written pronouncement issued by the [[President of the United States]] upon the signing of a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] into [[law]]. They are usually printed along with the bill in ''[[United States Code Congressional and Administrative News]]'' (USCCAN).  The statements begin with wording such as "This bill, which I have signed today" and continue with a brief description of the bill and often several paragraphs of political commentary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=26378&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16525&lt;/ref&gt;

During the administration of President [[George W. Bush]], there was a controversy over the President's use of signing statements, which critics charged was unusually extensive and modified the meaning of statutes. The practice predates the Bush administration, however, and was also used by the succeeding [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref name="Obama Signing Statements"&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=August 9, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/us/politics/09signing.html?ref=todayspaper|title=Obama's Embrace of a Bush Tactic Riles Congress | first=Charlie | last=Savage | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2006, a task force of the [[American Bar Association]] stated that the use of signing statements to modify the meaning of duly enacted laws serves to "undermine the [[rule of law]] and our [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] system of [[separation of powers]]".&lt;ref name="ABA Taskforce"&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[American Bar Association]] |date=July 24, 2006 |url=http://www.abanow.org/2006/07/blue-ribbon-task-force-finds-president-bushs-signing-statements-undermine-separation-of-powers/ |title=Blue-Ribbon Task Force Finds President Bush's Signing Statements Undermine Separation of Powers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615163547/http://www.abanow.org/2006/07/blue-ribbon-task-force-finds-president-bushs-signing-statements-undermine-separation-of-powers/ |archivedate=June 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
A study released by then-Assistant Attorney General [[Walter Dellinger]] (1993–1996) grouped signing statements into three categories:&lt;ref name=Dellinger&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010219034253/http://www.usdoj.gov/olc/signing.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2001 |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/olc/signing.htm |title=The Legal Significance of Presidential Signing Statements |date=November 3, 1993 |first=Walter |last=Dellinger |work=[[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] website }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Constitutional: asserts that the law is constitutionally defective in order to guide executive agencies in limiting its implementation;
* Political: defines vague terms in the law to guide executive agencies in its implementation as written;
* Rhetorical: uses the signing of the bill to mobilize political constituencies.

In recent usage, the phrase "signing statement" has referred mostly to statements relating to constitutional matters that direct executive agencies to apply the law according to the president's interpretation of the Constitution.

The "non-signing statement" is a related method that some presidents have used to express concerns about certain provisions in a bill without vetoing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ross |last=Wilson |title=A Third Way: The Presidential Non-Signing Statement |journal=[[Cornell Law Review]] |volume=96 |issue=6 |year=2011 |ssrn=1593862 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the non-signing statement, presidents announce their reasons for declining to sign, while allowing the bill to become law unsigned. The U.S. Constitution allows such enactments by default: if the President does not sign the bill, it becomes law after ten days, excepting Sundays, "[[Pocket veto#United States|unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return...]]"&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. art. I, § 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applying a metric to signing statements==
There is a controversy about how to count an [[executive (government)|executive]]'s use of signing statements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dean/20060714.html Bush Administration's Adversarial Relationship with Congress – as Illustrated by Its Refusal to Even Provide the Number of Signing Statements Issued by President Bush], by John Dean (see section "Non-Government Witnesses Are Not Certain How Many Signing Statements Bush Has Issued; And the Executive Branch Refuses to Reveal the Number")&lt;/ref&gt; A "flat count" of total signing statements would include the rhetorical and political statements as well as the constitutional. This may give a misleading number when the intent is to count the number of constitutional challenges issued. 	 
			
Another common metric is to count the "number of [[statute]]s" that are disputed by signing statements. This addresses a count of the constitutional issues but may be inherently inaccurate, due not only to ambiguity in the signing statements themselves but also to the method of determining which statutes are challenged.

A [[Congressional Research Service]] report issued on September 17, 2007,&lt;ref name="CRS"&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33667.pdf Presidential Signing Statements: Constitutional and Institutional Implications], Congressional Research Service, September 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; uses as a metric the percentage of signing statements that contain "objections" to provisions of the bill being signed into law:

{{quote|President Reagan issued 250 signing statements, 86 of which (34%) contained provisions objecting to one or more of the statutory provisions signed into law. President George H. W. Bush continued this practice, issuing 228 signing statements, 107 of which (47%) raised objections. President [Bill] Clinton's conception of presidential power proved to be largely consonant with that of the preceding two administrations. In turn, President Clinton made aggressive use of the signing statement, issuing 381 statements, 70 of which (18%) raised constitutional or legal objections. President George W. Bush has continued this practice, issuing 152 signing statements, 118 of which (78%) contain some type of challenge or objection.&lt;ref name="CRS" /&gt;}}

In March 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' cited a different metric, the number of sections within bills that were challenged in signing statements:

{{quote|Mr. [George W.] Bush ... broke all records, using signing statements to challenge about 1,200 sections of bills over his eight years in office, about twice the number challenged by all previous presidents combined, according to data compiled by Christopher Kelley, a political science professor at Miami University in Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/us/politics/10signing.html?_r=1 |title=Obama Looks to Limit Impact of Tactic Bush Used to Sidestep New Laws |author= [[Charlie Savage]] |date=March 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legal significance==
No [[United States Constitution]] provision, federal statute, or common-law principle explicitly permits or prohibits signing statements. However, there is also no part of the Constitution that grants legal value to signing statements. [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 7: Bills|Section 7]] (in the [[Presentment Clause]]) empowers the president to veto a law in its entirety, to sign it, or to do nothing.  [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]], [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Section 3: Presidential responsibilities|Section 3]] requires that the executive "take care that the laws be faithfully executed". The Constitution does not authorize the President to cherry-pick which parts of validly enacted Congressional Laws he is going to obey and execute, and which he is not.

Signing statements do not appear to have legal force by themselves, although they are all published in the ''[[Federal Register]]''. As a practical matter, they may give notice of the way that the Executive intends to implement a law, which may make them more significant than the text of the law itself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} There is a controversy about whether they should be considered as part of [[legislative history]]; proponents argue that they reflect the executive's position in negotiating with Congress; opponents assert that the executive's view of a law is not constitutionally part of the legislative history because only the Congress may make law.

Presidential signing statements maintain particular potency with federal executive agencies, since these agencies are often responsible for the administration and enforcement of federal laws. A 2007 article in the ''[[Administrative Law Review]]'' noted how some federal agencies' usage of signing statements may not withstand legal challenges under common law standards of judicial deference to agency action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nicholas J. |last=Leddy |title=Determining Due Deference: Examining When Courts Should Defer to Agency Use of Presidential Signing Statements |journal=[[Administrative Law Review]] |volume=59 |issue=4 |page=869 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court rulings===
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has not squarely addressed the limits of signing statements. ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' (1803) and its progeny are generally considered to have established [[judicial review]] as a power of the Court, rather than of the Executive. ''[[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.]]'', 467 U.S. 837 (1984), established court deference to executive interpretations of a law "[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=467&amp;page=837 if Congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue]" and if the interpretation is reasonable.  This applies only to executive agencies; the President himself is not entitled to Chevron deference. To the extent that a signing statement would nullify part or all of a law, the Court may have addressed the matter in ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'' (1998), which invalidated the [[line-item veto]] because it violated [[bicameralism]] and [[Presentment Clause|presentment]].

In ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2006), the Supreme Court gave no weight to a signing statement in interpreting the [[Detainee Treatment Act]] of 2005, according to that case's dissent (which included Justice [[Samuel Alito]], a proponent of expanded signing statements when he worked in the Reagan Justice Department – see "Presidential usage" below).

===Presidential usage===
The first [[President of the United States|president]] to issue a signing statement was [[James Monroe]].&lt;ref name="KelleyDiss"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kelley |first=Christopher |year=2003 |title=The Unitary Executive and the Presidential Signing Statement |type=Ph.D. |publisher=Miami University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1980s, with some exceptions, signing statements were generally triumphal, rhetorical, or political proclamations and went mostly unannounced. Until [[Ronald Reagan]] became President, only 75 statements had been issued; Reagan and his successors [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] produced 247 signing statements among the three of them.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Lithwick, Dahlia (Jan. 30, 2006). [http://www.slate.com/id/2134919/ "Sign Here"]. ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2004, [[George W. Bush]] had issued 108 signing statements containing 505 constitutional challenges.&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt;  As of January 30, 2008, he had signed 157 signing statements challenging over 1,100 provisions of federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coherentbabble.com/signingstatements/FAQs.htm#3.%20%20How%20many%20has%20George%20W.%20Bush%20signed |title=Presidential Signing Statements – FAQs – Learn About Presidential Signing Statements|accessdate=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upswing in the use of signing statements during the Reagan administration coincides with the writing by [[Samuel Alito]] – then a staff attorney in the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]'s [[Office of Legal Counsel]] – of a 1986 memorandum making the case for "interpretive signing statements" as a tool to "increase the power of the Executive to shape the law". Alito proposed adding signing statements to a "reasonable number of bills" as a pilot project, but warned that "Congress is likely to resent the fact that the President will get in the last word on questions of interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Samuel |last=Alito |url=https://www.archives.gov/news/samuel-alito/accession-060-89-269/Acc060-89-269-box6-SG-LSWG-AlitotoLSWG-Feb1986.pdf |title=Using Presidential Signing Statement to Make Fuller Use of the President's Constitutionally Assigned Role in the Process of Enacting Law |format=pdf |publisher=Office of Legal Counsel, United States Department of Justice |date=February 5, 1986 |accessdate=July 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A November 3, 1993, memo from White House Counsel [[Bernard W. Nussbaum|Bernard Nussbaum]] explained the use of signing statements to object to potentially unconstitutional legislation:

{{quote|If the President may properly decline to enforce a law, at least when it unconstitutionally encroaches on his powers, then it arguably follows that he may properly announce to Congress and to the public that he will not enforce a provision of an enactment he is signing. If so, then a signing statement that challenges what the President determines to be an unconstitutional encroachment on his power, or that announces the President's unwillingness to enforce (or willingness to litigate) such a provision, can be a valid and reasonable exercise of Presidential authority.&lt;ref name=Dellinger /&gt;}}

This same Department of Justice memorandum observed that use of presidential signing statements to create legislative history for the use of the courts was uncommon before the Reagan and Bush presidencies. In 1986, Attorney General [[Edwin Meese]] entered into an arrangement with the West Publishing Company to have Presidential signing statements published for the first time in the ''U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News,'' the standard collection of legislative history.

=== Controversy over George W. Bush's use of signing statements=== &lt;!-- this subsection is targeted by name in [[2007 Pulitzer Prize]]  --&gt;

George W. Bush's use of signing statements was and is controversial, both for the number of times employed (over 700 opinions, although [[Bill Clinton]] actually issued more&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/signingstatements.php#q4&lt;/ref&gt;) and for the apparent attempt to nullify legal restrictions on his actions through claims made in the statements – for example, his signing statement attached to the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008]].  Some opponents have said that he in effect uses signing statements as a [[line-item veto]]; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had previously ruled such vetoes as unconstitutional in the 1998 case, ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://writ.news.findlaw.com/scripts/printer_friendly.pl?page=/dean/20060113.html The Problem with Presidential Signing Statements: Their Use and Misuse by the Bush Administration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214054249/http://writ.news.findlaw.com/scripts/printer_friendly.pl?page=%2Fdean%2F20060113.html |date=2006-02-14 }} By John W. Dean, [http://www.findlaw.com/ FindLaw], January 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wikinews|Bush declares immunity from Patriot Act oversight}}
Previous administrations had made use of signing statements to dispute the validity of a new law or its individual components. George H. W. Bush challenged 232 statutes through signing statements during four years in office and Clinton challenged 140 over eight years. George W. Bush's 130 signing statements contain at least 1,100 challenges.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/06/19/us_agencies_disobey_6_laws_that_president_challenged/ US Agencies Disobey 6 Laws] [[Charlie Savage]], The Boston Globe, June 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The signing statement associated with the [[Detainee Treatment Act of 2005]], prohibiting cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment of detainees in U.S. custody attracted controversy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The executive branch shall construe... the Act, relating to detainees, in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of signing statements that fall into the constitutional category can create conundrums for executive branch employees. Political scientist James Pfiffner has written: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The president is the head of the executive branch, and in general, executive branch officials are bound to follow his direction. In cases in which a subordinate is ordered to do something illegal, the person can legitimately refuse the order. But if the public administrator is ordered to refuse to execute the law ... because the president has determined that the law infringes on his own interpretation of his constitutional authority, the public administrator faces an ethical dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Blue ribbon panel on signing statements ===

On July 24, 2006, the [[American Bar Association]]'s Task Force on Presidential Signing Statements and the Separation of Powers Doctrine, appointed by ABA President [[Michael S. Greco]], issued a widely publicized report condemning some uses of signing statements. The task force report and recommendations were unanimously approved by ABA delegates at their August 2006 meeting.&lt;ref name="ABA Taskforce" /&gt;

The bipartisan and independent blue ribbon panel was chaired by Miami lawyer [[Neal Sonnett]], a former Assistant U.S. Attorney and Chief of the Criminal Division for the Southern District of Florida. He is past chair of the ABA Criminal Justice Section, chair of the ABA Task Force on Domestic Surveillance and the ABA Task Force on Treatment of Enemy Combatants; and president-elect of the American Judicature Society.
&lt;!-- This is a lengthy stretch of material not directly related to the article. Should probably be moved to an article on the panel itself?

In addition to Chair Sonnett, the task force members included:

* '''William S. Sessions''', now in private practice in Washington, D.C., is a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, chief U.S. District Court judge for the Western District of Texas, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas, and chief of the Government Operations Section of the U.S. Department of Justice.
* '''Patricia M. Wald''', most recently a member of the President's Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, is a former chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and trial and appellate judge on the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. She was an assistant attorney general for legislative affairs in the Carter Administration.
* '''Former Rep. Mickey Edwards''', a lecturer at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and director of the Aspen Institute-Rodel Fellowships in Public Leadership, served in the House Republican Leadership as a member of Congress from 1977–1992, was a founding trustee of the Heritage Foundation, former national chair of the American Conservative Union, and director of policy advisory task forces for the Reagan presidential campaign.
* '''Bruce Fein''', a constitutional lawyer and international consultant with The Lichfield Group, was associate deputy attorney general and assistant director of the Office of Legal Policy of the Department of Justice under President Reagan. He also served as general counsel of the Federal Communications Commission, an adjunct scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, and a resident scholar at the Heritage Foundation.
* '''Dean and professor Harold Hongju Koh of Yale Law School''' is one of the country's leading experts on international human rights and national security law. A former assistant secretary of state, Koh advised former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright on U.S. policy on democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, and also served as an attorney in the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice.

*urge the President to confine any signing statements to his views regarding the meaning, purpose, and significance of bills, and to use his veto power if he believes that all or part of a bill is unconstitutional;

*urge Congress to enact legislation requiring the President promptly to submit to Congress an official copy of all signing statements, and to report to Congress the reasons and legal basis for any instance in which he claims the authority, or states the intention, to disregard or decline to enforce all or part of a law he has signed, or to interpret such a law in a manner inconsistent with the clear intent of Congress, and to make all such submissions be available in a publicly accessible database.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}}}

=== Signing statements in the Obama administration===
On March 9, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] ordered his executive officials to consult [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] before relying on one of [[George W. Bush]]'s signing statements to bypass a statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/us/politics/10signing.html | work=The New York Times | title=Obama Looks to Limit Impact of Tactic Bush Used to Sidestep New Laws | first=Charlie | last=Savage | date=March 10, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he only plans to use signing statements when given legislation by [[United States Congress|Congress]] which contain [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] provisions. In a memo to the heads of each department in the [[United States Executive Branch|executive branch]], Obama wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Memorandum-on-Presidential-Signing-Statements|title=Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies SUBJECT: Presidential Signing Statements|author=Barack Obama|date=March 9, 2009|publisher=The [[White House]]|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In exercising my responsibility to determine whether a provision of an enrolled bill is unconstitutional, I will act with caution and restraint, based only on interpretations of the Constitution that are well-founded.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During his presidential campaign, Obama rejected the use of signing statements. He was asked at one rally: "when congress offers you a bill, do you promise not to use presidential signing statements to get your way?" Obama gave a one-word reply: "Yes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://opiniojuris.org/2009/07/01/did-anyone-oppose-signing-statements-just-koh-the-aba-and-some-guy-named-barack/]&lt;/ref&gt; He added that "we aren't going to use signing statements as a way to do an end run around Congress."  On March 11, 2009, Obama issued his first signing statement, attached to the [[omnibus spending bill]] for the second half of the 2009 fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/obama-pushes-for-new-earmark-rules/ | work=The New York Times | title=Obama Pushes for New Earmark Rules | date=March 11, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Numerous provisions of the legislation purport to condition the authority of officers to spend or reallocate funds on the approval of congressional committees. These are impermissible forms of legislative aggrandizement in the execution of the laws other than by enactment of statutes. Therefore, although my Administration will notify the relevant committees before taking the specified actions, and will accord the recommendations of such committees all appropriate and serious consideration, spending decisions shall not be treated as dependent on the approval of congressional committees. Likewise, one other provision gives congressional committees the power to establish guidelines for funding costs associated with implementing security improvements to buildings. Executive officials shall treat such guidelines as advisory.

Yet another provision requires the Secretary of the Treasury to accede to all requests of a Board of Trustees that contains congressional representatives. The Secretary shall treat such requests as nonbinding.}}

This statement indicated that while the administration could ignore several provisions of the bill, they would advise congressional committees, and take congressional committees guidelines as advisory, as he considers that "provisions of the legislation purport to condition the authority of officers to spend or reallocate funds on the approval of congressional committees" and the result would be "impermissible forms of legislative aggrandizement in the execution of the laws other than by enactment of statutes", including sections dealing with negotiations with foreign governments, restrictions on US involvement in UN peacekeeping missions, protections for government whistleblowers, and certain congressional claims of authority over spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Good |title=Obama Issues Omnibus Signing Statement |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=March 11, 2009 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/03/obama-issues-omnibus-signing-statement/1438/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/03/obama-issues-his-first-signing-statement.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/us/politics/12signing.html | work=The New York Times | title=Obama Says He Can Ignore Some Parts of Spending Bill | first=Charlie | last=Savage | date=March 12, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama issued a total of 37 signing statements during the course of his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Congressional efforts to restrict signing statements==
Sen. [[Arlen Specter]] (then a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] of [[Pennsylvania]]) introduced the Presidential Signing Statements Act of 2006 on July 26, 2006.&lt;ref name="thomas.loc.gov"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:s.03731: Search Results - Thomas (Library of Congress)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would:
# Instruct all state and federal courts to ignore presidential signing statements. ("No State or Federal court shall rely on or defer to a presidential signing statement as a source of authority.")
# Instruct the Supreme Court to allow the [[U.S. Senate]] or [[U.S. House of Representatives]] to file suit in order to determine the constitutionality of signing statements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.3731: Search Results – Thomas (Library of Congress)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was referred to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], which Specter chaired at the time, on the day it was introduced.&lt;ref name="thomas.loc.gov"/&gt; As with all unpassed bills, it expired with the end of the [[109th United States Congress]] on December 9, 2006.

Specter reintroduced the legislation with the Presidential Signing Statements Act of 2007, but it died in the same committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:S.1747: Search Results – Thomas (Library of Congress)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Socialism with a human face''' (in [[Czech language|Czech]]: ''socialismus s lidskou tváří'', in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''socializmus s ľudskou tvárou'') was a political programme announced by [[Alexander Dubček]] and his colleagues agreed at Presidium of [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] on April 1968 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://www.country-studies.com/czech-republic/the-prague-spring,-1968.html|title=The Prague Spring, 1968|accessdate=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; after he became the chairman of the Party in January 1968. The first author of this slogan was [[Radovan Richta]]. It was a process of mild [[democratization]] and [[political liberalization]] that would still enable the Communist Party to maintain real power. Instead, it initiated the [[Prague spring]] which, on the night of 20-21 August 1968, was crushed by the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].

== Background ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2017}}
The programme was an attempt to overcome the disillusionment of the people of [[Czechoslovakia]] with the political and economic situation at the time. As the name suggests, the plan was to breathe new life into the ideals of socialism, which had lost popular support due to the government policies of the previous two decades.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} It never intended to bring back market capitalism.

== Programme ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2017}}
The programme initially called for greater participation of the people in local and country politics under the umbrella of the Communist Party, for greater freedom of the press and of culture and emphasised the need for personal initiative in economics. The most loathed representatives of the previous style of rule were left to go.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The programme did not envisage the existence of independent political parties or private ownership of companies. Participation in [[Eastern Bloc]] structures was not questioned.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The events of the Prague Spring, especially their speed and escalation, outstripped the original programme, to the surprise and dismay of its authors.

== Prague Spring and Soviet invasion ==
{{main|Prague Spring|Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Normalization (Czechoslovakia)}}
The subsequent developments became known as the Prague Spring, which on the night of 20–21 August 1968 was crushed by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. The [[Soviet Union]] feared losing control over the country and invaded Czechoslovakia on 21 August with 200,000 troops and 5,000 tanks.

The liberalizing reforms were eliminated step by step and the country eventually returned to the centralized model with the Communist Party organizing every aspect of political and economic life. Most of the influential people involved in the programme lost their political power and became targets of persecution.

The only surviving change was [[federalization]] of the country (by creating the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and the [[Slovak Socialist Republic]] in 1969). The Communist Party soon labeled "socialism with a human face" as an "attempt to destroy the advantages of socialist society and bring back the old system of exploiting people" and accused Western imperialism and emigrants for starting and nurturing the programme.

In 1987, the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] acknowledged that his liberalizing policies of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] owed a great deal to Dubček's socialism with a human face. When asked what the difference was between the Prague Spring and his own reforms, Gorbachev replied: "Nineteen years".

The '''Southern Agrarians''' (also the '''Twelve Southerners''', the '''Vanderbilt Agrarians''', the '''Nashville Agrarians''', the '''Tennessee Agrarians''', and the '''Fugitive Agrarians''') were a group of twelve American writers, poets, essayists, and novelists, all with roots in the [[Southern United States]], who united to write a pro–Southern [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] manifesto, published as the essay collection ''I’ll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition'' (1930).{{Sfn | Davidson | Fletcher | Kline | Lanier | 2006}}  The Southern Agrarians greatly contributed to the [[Southern Renaissance]], the revival of [[Southern literature]] in the 1920s and 1930s, and were based at [[Vanderbilt University]], in Nashville, with [[John Crowe Ransom]] as the unofficial leader.

==Members==
The Southern Agrarians included:
*[[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]], poet, essayist, reviewer and historian
*[[John Gould Fletcher]], poet and historian
*[[Henry Blue Kline]]
*[[Lyle H. Lanier]]
*[[Andrew Nelson Lytle]], poet, novelist and essayist
*[[Herman Clarence Nixon]]
*[[Frank Lawrence Owsley]], historian
*[[John Crowe Ransom]], poet, professor, essayist
*[[Allen Tate]], poet
*[[John Donald Wade]], biographer and essayist
*[[Robert Penn Warren]], poet, novelist, essayist and critic, later first [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry|poet laureate of the United States]]
*[[Stark Young]], novelist, drama and literary critic, playwright

==Background and general ideas of the Southern Agrarians==
The Agrarians were offended by [[H. L. Mencken]]'s  attacks on aspects of Southern culture that they valued, such as its agrarianism, conservatism, and religiosity.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Edward S. (1972). [http://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/view/2401/2360 "The Southern Agrarians, H. L. Mencken, and the Quest for Southern Identity"], ''American Studies'' 13: 75-92.&lt;/ref&gt; They sought to confront the widespread and rapidly increasing effects of modernity, urbanism, and industrialism on American (but especially Southern) culture and tradition. The informal leader of the Fugitives and the Agrarians was [[John Crowe Ransom]], but in a 1945 essay, he announced that he no longer believed in either the possibility or the desirability of an Agrarian restoration, which he declared a "fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, John Crowe (1945). "Art and the Human Economy", ''[[Kenyon Review]]'' 7: 686.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under attack as reactionary==
''I'll Take My Stand'' was attacked at the time, and since, as a reactionary and romanticized defense of the [[Old South]] and the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]]. It ignored slavery and denounced "progress", for example, and some critics considered it to be moved by nostalgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Louis | last = Rubin | chapter = Introduction | title = I'll take my stand: the South and the agrarian tradition | year = 1962 | page = xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-first = Bethany L | editor-last = Johnson | title = The Southern Agrarian and the New Deal: Essays after "I'll Take My Stand" | year = 2001 | page = 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Lewis P | last = Simpson | title = The Fable of the Southern Writer | year = 2003 | chapter = 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the Agrarians were challenged by the modernizing social scientists (the "Chapel Hill Sociologists") based at the University of North Carolina (in Chapel Hill) and led by [[Howard W. Odum]], on issues of urbanism, social progress, and the very nature and definition of the South. The sociologists produced Rupert Vance's ''The Human Geography of the South'' (1932), and Odum's ''Southern Regions of the United States'' (1936), as well as numerous articles in the journal ''Social Forces.''  The sociologists argued that the problems in the South stemmed from traditionalism which ought to and could be cured by modernization, the opposite of the Agrarian viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Robert ‘Bob’ | last = Holladay | title = The Gods That Failed: Agrarianism, Regionalism, and the Nashville-Chapel Hill Highway | journal = Tennessee Historical Quarterly |date=Dec 2005 | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 284–307}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==
At a reunion of the Fugitive Poets in 1956, Warren confessed that for about a decade — from just before World War II to some years after — he had shut Agrarianism from his mind as irrelevant to the cataclysmic social and political events then playing out in the world.  Now, however, he believed that, rather than being irrelevant, his old Agrarian enthusiasms were tied into the major problems of the age.  In the modern world, the individual had been marginalized, stripped of any sense of responsibility, or of past or place.  "In this context," writes Paul V. Murphy, "the Agrarian image of a better [[History of the United States (1789–1849)|antebellum]] South came to represent for Warren a potential source of spiritual revitalization.  The past recalled, not as a mythical 'golden age' but 'imaginatively conceived and historically conceived in the strictest readings of the researchers', could be a 'rebuke to the present'."&lt;ref name=rebuke&gt;Murphy, Paul V. (2001). [http://www.ibiblio.org/uncpress/chapters/murphy_rebuke.html ''The Rebuke of History'': Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119023712/http://www.ibiblio.org/uncpress/chapters/murphy_rebuke.html |date=2012-01-19 }}, University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Warren's concern with democracy, regionalism, personal liberty and individual responsibility that led him to support the [[civil rights movement]], which he depicted in his nonfiction works ''Segregation'' (1956) and ''Who Speaks for the Negro?'' (1965) as a struggle for identity and individualism.  As Hugh Ruppersburg, among others, has argued, Warren's support for the civil rights movement paradoxically stemmed from Agrarianism, which by the 1950s, meant for him something very different from the Agrarianism of ''I'll Take My Stand''.&lt;ref&gt;Ruppenburg, Hugh (1990). ''Robert Penn Warren and the American Imagination'', University of Georgia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Warren's political and social views evolved, his notion of Agrarianism evolved with them.  He came to support more [[Progressivism|progressive]] ideas and [[racial integration]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sandy (2008). [http://www.vanderbilt.edu/magazines/arts-and-science/2008-11/voices-from-the-past/ "Voices from the Past"]&lt;/ref&gt; and was a close friend of the eminent African-American author [[Ralph Ellison]].&lt;ref&gt;Ealy, Steven D. (2006). [http://www.clemson.edu/cedp/press/scr/articles/scr_38.2_warren_essay_ealy.pdf "'A Friendship That Has Meant So Much': Robert Penn Warren and Ralph W. Ellison"], ''The South Carolina Review'' Vol. 38, No. 2: 162-172.&lt;/ref&gt;  While Donald Davidson took a leading role in the attempt to preserve the system of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], Warren took his stand against it.  As Paul V. Murphy writes, "Loyalty to the southern past and the ambiguous lessons of Agrarianism led both men in very different directions."&lt;ref name=rebuke/&gt;

==Conservatives==
In recent decades, some traditionalistic [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] such as [[Allan C. Carlson]], [[Joseph Scotchie]], and [[Eugene Genovese]] have praised the Agrarian themes in light of what they see as the failures of highly urbanized and industrialized modern societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Thomas Daniel | last = Young | title = Waking Their Neighbors Up: The Nashville Agrarians Rediscovered | publisher = U. of Georgia Press | year = 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Southern Agrarians are regularly lauded in the conservative media such as the ''[[Southern Partisan]]''.  Some of their social, economic, and political ideas have been refined and updated by writers such as Allan C. Carlson and [[Wendell Berry]].  The [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]] has published books which further explore the ideas of the Agrarians.

== Statement of Principles ==
A key quote from the "Introduction: A Statement of Principles" to their 1930 book ''I'll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition'':

{{quote |All the articles bear in the same sense upon the book's title-subject: all tend to support a Southern way of life against what may be called the American or prevailing way; and all as much as agree that the best terms in which to represent the distinction are contained in the phrase, Agrarian ''versus'' Industrial.  ...Opposed to the industrial society is the agrarian, which does not stand in particular need of definition. An agrarian society is hardly one that has no use at all for industries, for professional vocations, for scholars and artists, and for the life of cities. Technically, perhaps, an agrarian society is one in which agriculture is the leading vocation, whether for wealth, for pleasure, or for prestige – a form of labor that is pursued with intelligence and leisure, and that becomes the model to which the other forms approach as well as they may. But an agrarian regime will be secured readily enough where the superfluous industries are not allowed to rise against it. The theory of agrarianism is that the culture of the soil is the best and most sensitive of vocations, and that therefore it should have the economic preference and enlist the maximum number of workers."{{Sfn | Davidson | Fletcher | Kline | Lanier | 1930}}}}

'''The State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus''' ({{lang-ru|Комитет государственной безопасности Республики Беларусь}}, КГБ, '''KGB'''; {{lang-be|Камітэт дзяржаўнай бяспекі, КДБ; [[Romanization of Belarusian|translit.]] Kamitet Dziaržaǔnaj Biaspieki, KDB}}) is the national [[intelligence agency]] of [[Belarus]]. Along with its counterparts in [[Transnistria]] and [[South Ossetia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Ossetian KGB Says Situation Could Get Out Of Control|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/south_ossetia_tense_after_vote/24408072.html|accessdate=22 February 2014|newspaper=Radio Free Europe|date=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is one of the few intelligence agencies that kept the Russian name "[[KGB]]" after the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], albeit it is lost in translation when written in Belarusian (becoming KDB rather than KGB).

It is the Belarusian successor organization to the [[KGB]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Felix Dzerzhinsky|Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky]], who founded the [[Cheka]] – the original [[Bolshevik]] intelligence police – was born [[Minsk Governorate|in what is now Belarus]] and remains an important figure in the state ideology of Belarus under president [[Alexander Lukashenko]] as well as a patron of the KGB of Belarus.

It is governed by the law ''About State Security Bodies of the Republic of Belarus''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kgb.by/en/|title=The State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus|website=www.kgb.by|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major General]] [[Vadim Zaitsev]], who was in charge of Lukashenko's personal security, was appointed its leader in July 2008. His tenure lasted until November 2012 and he was replaced by [[Valery Vakulchik]].&lt;ref name=diplo2011&gt;{{cite news|title=Belarusian KGB's new chief is Valery Vakulchik|url=http://www.diplonews.com/feeds/free/20_November_2012_283.php|accessdate=31 March 2013|newspaper=DiploNews|date=20 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219043807/http://www.diplonews.com/feeds/free/20_November_2012_283.php|archivedate=19 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KGB is formally controlled by the [[president of Belarus]], [[Alexander Lukashenko]].

==Role in political repressions== 
According to human rights organisations, the [[United States]], and the [[European Union]], the KGB and its senior leadership play a key role in [[Human rights in Belarus|human rights violations and political repressions]] in Belarus. The KGB has maintained both the name, the symbols and some of the repressive functions of its Soviet predecessor, the [[KGB|KGB of the Soviet Union]].

Several dozens former Chairmen and senior officers of the KGB of Belarus have been included in the [[List of people and organizations sanctioned in relation to human rights violations in Belarus|sanctions lists]] of the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]], especially following the brutal crackdown of peaceful protests that followed the allegedly falsified presidential elections of [[Belarusian presidential election, 2006|2006]] and [[Belarusian presidential election, 2010|2010]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=61552 Поўны спіс 208 беларускіх чыноўнікаў, якім забаронены ўезд у ЕС] - [[Nasha Niva]], 11.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt; Against most of them, the sanctions have been lifted in 2016 following an improvement of the [[Belarus–European Union relations]].

[[FreedomWorks]] began planning the event in March 2009, according to a FreedomWorks spokesperson.&lt;ref name=alex/&gt; The [[political advocacy group]]s [[Americans for Prosperity]] and FreedomWorks were "probably the leading partners" in the event, according to ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref name=guardian20090918&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Pilkington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/18/republicans-internet-barack-obama |title=Republicans steal Barack Obama's internet campaigning tricks |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 18, 2009 |accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday, September 12, participants gathered at Freedom Plaza, located just east of the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-09-11-tax-rally_N.htm | title=Tens of thousands rally in D.C. against federal spending | last=Seaman | first=Andrew |author2=Bazar, Emily  | date=September 12, 2009 | work=[[USA Today]] | publisher=usatoday.com | accessdate=September 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The march was scheduled to proceed [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] at 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., led by a [[Ancient Fife and Drum Corps|fife and drum corps]], and march towards [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]]; however due to a larger-than-expected number of protesters, the Plaza and surrounding area became overcrowded and the march set off one hour ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-capitol-rally13-2009sep13,0,5742055.story | title=Massive crowd marches against Obama's agenda | last=Barabak | first=Mark Z. | date=September 13, 2009 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | publisher=latimes.com | accessdate=September 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090913/pl_afp/usdemogovernmentobama | title=Thousands rally against Obama | last=Zeitvogel | first=Karin | date=September 13, 2009 | work=[[Agence France-Presse]] | publisher=[[Yahoo!

===Signage===
[[File:Tea Party sign - US Capitol.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Protest sign with the [[United States Capitol dome]] in the background]]
Though many of the signs were close to the original Tea Party message of "Taxed Enough Already," such as "Stop Obama's Spending Spree," some of the handwritten signs carried by protesters included statements such as "Liar Liar Pants on Fire!" and "Hey Obamacare!

[[Matt Kibbe]], president of [[FreedomWorks]], the organizer of the event, stated on stage that [[ABC News]] had reported 1 million to 1.5 million protesters in attendance. ABC News later published an article saying that they were misquoted by Kibbe, and went on to report that 60,000 to 70,000 had attended the event, citing the unofficial D.C. Fire Department number.&lt;ref name=attendance/&gt;  After comparing photographs of Saturday's protest with previous events, FreedomWorks revised their crowd estimate to be between 600,000 and 800,000.&lt;ref name=crowds/&gt;&lt;ref name=tpm&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/freedomworks-cuts-estimate-for-crowd-at-its-912-rally-by-one-half.php | title=FreedomWorks Cuts Estimate For Crowd At Its 9/12 Rally By One Half | date=September 14, 2009 | last=Kleefeld | first=Eric | work=[[Talking Points Memo]] | publisher=(tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com) | accessdate=September 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pete Sepp, a spokesman for the [[National Taxpayers Union]], one of the organizations that sponsored the march, said the group estimated the crowd at 75,000 in the morning and from 200,000 and 300,000 as the day went on.&lt;ref name=crowds/&gt;

[[Farouk El-Baz]], a [[Boston University]] research professor and expert on crowd estimation, told the ''[[LA Times]]'' that his informal research from media coverage indicated 75,000 as the peak attendance.  El-Baz noted that, because there seemed to be no aerial photos of the event, reaching any sort of rigorous estimate might be impossible. The [[Washington Metro]] reported 87,000 extra riders that day as compared to the average ridership.&lt;ref name=crowds/&gt;

== History and background ==
First held on June 2, 2016, in Monte Carlo, Monaco, the '''Forum on Energy Security for the Future: New sources, Responsibility, Sustainability'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/energy-security-for-the-future-international-forum-monaco-june-2-2016/&lt;/ref&gt; promotes non-polluting renewable energy. It calls for close cooperation and coordination among countries, organizations and civil society to address common security challenges and energy concerns.

With more than 150 guests in attendance, including European politicians, energy experts, journalists and owners of Europe's largest energy companies, the Forum has already gained recognition as the most ambitious European project on energy security issues and promotion of alternative energy sources.

"This is such a unique occasion, when a Forum managed to bring together different people of different social status to address European energy security. Organized by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation and Burisma Group, the Forum doesn't only attempt to attract socially responsible businesses and civil society over the idea of energy security, it also offers an exclusive discussion platform that allows participants to share their thoughts and lay foundation for a comprehensive long-term strategy of energy security in Europe", admitted co-founder of the Forum and the President of Burisma Group Nikolay Zlochevskyi.

The Forum was opened by HSH Prince Albert II of Monaco. In his speech he focused on the need to develop alternative energy sources and outlined that the topic of the Forum was “essential” for a secure and prosperous future of European states. 
[[File:Energy Security Forum 2017.jpg|thumb|Energy Security Forum 2017]]
“Energy security planning has to be done in a long-term perspective,” the Prince noted. “We should pay more attention to renewable energy sources that would enable getting cheap energy without polluting the environment.”

Organized by Burisma Group in partnership with the Adam Smith Conferences, and with support from the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation and the [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]]'s Foundation Amicus Europae, the '''Second International Forum on Energy Security for the Future: New vision, Strategy, Innovation''' took place on June 2, 2017 in Monte Carlo, Monaco. The event addressed Europe’s energy security with focus on Ukraine’s increasing role in the European energy market.

“This event goes in line with our corporate objectives, but most importantly, it reflects values and principles that we, at Burisma Group, stand by: integrity, social responsibility and innovation. We are proud that the Forum is becoming Europe’s largest energy platform. Every year, more and more politicians and public figures join in to aid the cause. With the support from the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, we are hoping that our Forum will bring tangible results for the entire Europe”, admitted the Head of the Organizing Committee and Advisor to the Board of Directors at Burisma Group [[:uk:Пожарський_Вадим_Юрійович|Vadym Pozharskyi]]..

'''The third annual Forum on''' '''ENERGY SECURITY FOR THE FUTURE''' will take place on June 1, 2018 in Monte Carlo, Monaco.

Energy Security for the Future 2018, Monaco

According to the founder of the Forum on Energy Security for the Future and the President of Burisma Group - Nikolai Zlochevskyi, For the last three years, the Energy Security for the Future forum has acquired the status of the largest public, political, economic and innovation movement aimed at bringing together all politicians and people around the formation of a single, secure European alliance. “Only consolidation can effectively promote the new innovative formats of clean energy sources in the lives of Europeans. Taking into account interdependence and global challenges, only a strong, energetically independent Europe can guarantee a future for its peoples. Ukraine is already an important strategic link in the overall system of energy security in Europe", - Nikolai Zlochevskyi said.

== Partners ==

Since its creation in 2016, the Forum on Energy Security for the Future has established partnerships with a diverse range of stakeholders and international organizations interested in accelerating renewable energy deployment and introduction of latest technologies. These alliances reflect a commitment to long-term promotion of renewable energy around the world.

To advance its mission, the Forum&lt;ref&gt;http://nvs24.com/news/energy/Burisma-Group-Together-With-the-Prince-Albert-II-of-Monaco-Foundation-Will-Be-Holding-a-European-Forum-on-Energy-Security-for-the-Future-New-Sources-Responsibility-Sustainability-5219401.html&lt;/ref&gt; is closely working with the Aleksander Kwaśniewski's foundation "Amicus Europae"&lt;ref&gt;http://kwasniewskialeksander.pl/english/presidents-activities/foundation-amicus-europae&lt;/ref&gt; on the development of the European Neighborhood Policy, with a special focus on Ukraine and Belarus and fostering the transatlantic dialogue and future of Europe debates.

"The topic of this forum is very important, as energy is a key factor not just today -- it will also remain a key factor in the future," Kwaśniewski said. "The modern world is changing faster than ever. I hope that Burisma will continue to support such initiatives".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/business-wire/albert-ii-prince-of-monaco-and-burisma-held-the-first-international-forum-on-energy-security-in-europe-415691.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Political Graveyard''' is a [[website]] and [[database]] that catalogues information on more than 277,000 [[Politics of the United States|American political figures]] and [[List of United States political families|political families]], along with other information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/living/2016-06-22/joan-griffisillinois-ancestors-political-graveyard-site-not-what-you-think.html|title=Joan Griffis/Illinois Ancestors: Political Graveyard site not what you think|date=June 22, 2016|first=Joan|last=Griffis|work=[[The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana)|The News Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The database attempts to capture very basic biographical and office-holding data for its political figures. Besides where they are buried,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zach Hagadone |title=The Political Graveyard |url=https://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/the-political-graveyard/Content?oid=3922709 |accessdate=12 June 2018 |work=Boise Weekly |date=2 November 2016 |quote=If you're sick to death of politics, take a stroll through The Political Graveyard (politicalgraveyard.com), which logs where more than 200,000 U.S. politicians are buried.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it records dates and locations of birth and death, offices held and the applicable dates, organizational affiliations, and cause of death. It also reports their relation (at least by blood and marriage) with other politicians listed, their [[List of political parties in the United States|political party]], and limited military history. The names are sorted and indexed by surname, birthplace, positions held, demography, religion, occupation, cause of death, and final resting place, with each entry usually having fewer than five lines of text.

The name comes from the website's inclusion of the burial locations of the deceased, when known.

The site was created in 1996 by [[Lawrence Kestenbaum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Mark Leibovich]] |title=Hitting a Self-Destruct Button |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/01/weekinreview/01leib.html |accessdate=12 June 2018 |work=New York Times |date=1 October 2006 |quote=“You always seem to have politicians doing bizarrely self-destructive things, especially involving sex,” says Lawrence Kestenbaum, creator of “Political Graveyard,” a history Web site that includes an exhaustive cataloging of transgressions by politicians.}}&lt;/ref&gt; then an academic specialist at [[Michigan State University]], and later on staff at the [[University of Michigan]]. Kestenbaum was formerly a county commissioner, and in 2004 was elected to be [[County Clerk]]/[[Register of Deeds]] of [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]], [[Michigan]]. The site and its underlying database were developed from a personal interest triggered by the ''Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress'', which was its original data source. Since then his personal research, and the information contributions of hundreds of volunteers have greatly expanded the information available.

Over the years the definition of "eligible political figure" has been expanded. It now includes most high federal officials, [[ambassador]]s, all elected and some appointed [[U.S. state|statewide]] officeholders, and many mayors. It lists unsuccessful candidates, presidential electors, and delegates to [[U.S. presidential nominating convention]]s of the major political parties.

Politicians are listed alphabetically, by office held or sought, and by location of birth, residence, and death.  Some are listed in categories, including occupations, ethnicity, religious and organizational affiliation, honors and awards.  Politicians accused of crimes or touched by scandal are listed by the nature of the accusation, as well as by decade and by state.  Cause of death is broken down into dozens of categories.

The site also lists [[political families]].  Individuals listed on the site are linked together if their relationship meets the [[Rule of 1/1000 common ancestry]].  Each cluster of three or more linked politicians is treated as a family, with family name and location assigned by an [[algorithm]]; the largest individual family cluster is the Kennedys, with 34 members.  The site's largest cluster, with 2,134 members, is called "Two Thousand Related Politicians"; most of the larger families are subsets of this group, with each subset defined and named by an algorithm. The largest subset family is the Huntington-Chapin-Waterman family of Connecticut, with 229 members.

The '''Third Force''' ('''''Troisième Force''''') was a French coalition during the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] (1947–1958) which gathered the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) party, the centre-right [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] (UDSR), the [[Radical Party (France)|Radicals]], the Christian democrat [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP) and other centrist politicians, opposed both to the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) and the [[Gaullist]] movement. The Third Force governed France from 1947 to 1951, succeeding the ''[[tripartisme]]'' alliance between the SFIO, the MRP and the PCF. The Third Force was also supported by the conservative [[National Centre of Independents and Peasants]] (CNIP), which succeeded in having its most popular figure, [[Antoine Pinay]], named [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] in 1952, a year after the dissolving of the Third Force coalition.

==History==

During the later decades of the Third Republic, the majority of French voters and deputies belonged to the spectrum of numerous small liberal and republican parties of the centre-left and centre-right. During election-time, this spectrum tended to split in half, its centre-left wing cooperating in electoral lists with the main socialist party ([[French Section of the Workers' International|SFIO]]) and its centre-right wing with the main Catholic party ([[Republican Federation (France)|URD]]). Periodically, however, the parties of the broad centre attempted to form an alliance amongst themselves to lock out socialists and the religious right from power: the policy of creating a government of 'third force' through the tactic of 'republican concentration'. At that time, given the balance of political support and the divisions among the republicans, such a tactic was rarely successful.

After the war and the installation of the Fourth Republic, the appearance of powerful mass political movements on the far-left and far-right, the Communists and Gaullists, provided a renewed incentive for the miscellaneous parties of the centre to combine their forces to lock out the extremes. The Third Force government was organised after the dismissal of vice-premier [[Maurice Thorez]] and four others Communist ministers from [[Paul Ramadier]]'s government during the [[May 1947 crisis]]. The May 1947 crisis can be summarized as: "The Communists' refusal to continue support for the French colonial reconquest of Vietnam on one hand and a wage-freeze during a period of hyperinflation on the other were the immediate triggers to the dismissal of Thorez and his colleagues from the ruling coalition in May 1947".  Nevertheless, the heterogeity of the Third Force increased the ministerial instability. Although it kept its majority after the [[French legislative election, 1951|1951 legislative election]], in part due to the change of voting system, it split over  economic policies, ''[[laïcité]]'' and the financing of denominational schools. The Socialists left the cabinet and the following governments were formed by centre and centre-right parties: the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]], the UDSR, the MRP and the [[National Centre of Independents and Peasants]] (CNIP)  

The idea of reviving a Third Force between the centre-left and the centre-right in France has been raised periodically ever since. The Socialist [[Gaston Defferre]] and the Radical [[Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber]] advocated such an alliance in the 1960s, culminating in Defferre's disastrous candidacy in the [[French presidential election, 1969]]. Presidents [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] and then [[François Mitterrand]] unsuccessfully tried to revive the Third Force, the latter doing so in a sense by pursuing a policy of "ouverture" toward the UDF after the failure of the Socialists and their allies to gain an outright majority in the [[French legislative election, 1988]]. However, each time, the most important right-wing party, the [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR), opposed itself to such an alliance. This strategy is now followed by [[François Bayrou]] and the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]] (MoDem), a centrist party.

'''Thomas Robert Malthus''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|l|θ|ə|s}}; 13 February 1766&amp;nbsp;– 23 December 1834)&lt;ref&gt;Several sources give Malthus's date of death as 15 December  1834. See [http://www.retrobibliothek.de/retrobib/seite.html?id=110865 ''Meyers Konversationslexikon''] (Leipzig, 4th edition, 1885–1892), [http://homepages.caverock.net.nz/~kh/bobperson.html "Biography"] by Nigel Malthus (the memorial transcription reproduced in this article). But article in {{cite EB1911|wstitle=Malthus, Thomas Robert |volume=17 |page=515 |short=x}} gives 23 December 1834.&lt;/ref&gt; was an English cleric and scholar, influential in the fields of [[political economy]] and [[demography]].&lt;ref name="Petersen, William 1979"&gt;Petersen, William. 1979.

In his 1798 book ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', Malthus observed that an increase in a nation's food production improved the well-being of the populace, but the improvement was temporary because it led to population growth, which in turn restored the original per capita production level. In other words, mankind had a propensity to utilize [[Abundance (economics)|abundance]] for population growth rather than for maintaining a high standard of living, a view that has become known as the "[[Malthusian trap]]" or the "Malthusian spectre".  Populations had a tendency to grow until the lower class suffered hardship and want and greater susceptibility to [[famine]] and [[disease]], a view that is sometimes referred to as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. Malthus wrote in opposition to the popular view in 18th-century Europe that saw society as improving and in principle as perfectible.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Oxford World's Classics reprint. viii in Oxford World's Classics reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw [[population growth]] as being inevitable whenever conditions improved, thereby precluding real progress towards a [[utopia]]n society: "The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man".&lt;ref name="Malthus T.R 1798. p13"&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Chapter 1, p. 13 in Oxford World's Classics reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; As an Anglican cleric, Malthus saw this situation as divinely imposed to teach virtuous behaviour.&lt;ref name=bowler&gt;{{cite book|author=Bowler, Peter J.|title=Evolution: the history of an idea|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|year=2003|pages=104–05|isbn=0-520-23693-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Malthus wrote:
{{quote|That the increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence,&lt;br&gt;That population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase, and,&lt;br&gt;That the superior power of population is repressed by moral restraint, vice and misery.&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'', in Oxford World's Classics reprint. p. 61, end of Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Malthus criticized the [[English Poor Laws|Poor Laws]] for leading to inflation rather than improving the well-being of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Chapter V, pp. 39–45. in Oxford World's Classics reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported taxes on grain imports (the [[Corn Laws]]), because food security was more important than maximizing wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798.

Pioneers of [[evolutionary biology]] read him, notably [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Janet 1995. ''Charles Darwin: Voyaging''.

==Early life and education==
The seventh child of Henrietta Catherine (Graham) and Daniel Malthus,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://homepages.caverock.net.nz/~kh/bobperson.html|title=Malthus TRM Biography|accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Thomas_Robert_Malthus.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Malthus grew up in The Rookery, a country house in [[Westcott, Surrey|Westcott]], near [[Dorking]] in [[Surrey]]. Petersen describes Daniel Malthus as "a gentleman of good family and independent means... [and] a friend of [[David Hume]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]".&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, William. 1979. ''Malthus''. Heinemann, London. 2nd ed 1999. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The young Malthus received his education at home in [[Bramcote]], [[Nottinghamshire]], and then at the [[Warrington Academy]] from 1782. Warrington was a [[dissenting academy]], which closed in 1783; Malthus continued for a period to be tutored by [[Gilbert Wakefield]] who had taught him there.&lt;ref name="Godwin1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Avery|title=Progress, Poverty and Population: Re-Reading Condorcet, Godwin and Malthus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZA0lNlvbh0sC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=14 June 2013|year=1997|publisher=Frank Cass|isbn=978-0-7146-4750-0|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus entered [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] in 1784.

==Population growth==
{{details|Malthusian catastrophe}}
[[File:Malthus - Essay on the principle of population, 1826 - 5884843.tif|thumb|''Essay on the principle of population'', 1826]]
Malthus came to prominence for his 1798 essay on [[population growth]]. In it, he argued that population multiplies [[Geometric progression|geometrically]] and food [[Arithmetic progression|arithmetically]]; therefore, whenever the food supply increases, population will rapidly grow to eliminate the abundance. Between 1798 and 1826 he published six editions of ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', updating each edition to incorporate new material, to address criticism, and to convey changes in his own perspectives on the subject. He wrote the original text in reaction to the optimism of his father and his father's associates (notably Rousseau) regarding the future improvement of society. Malthus also constructed his case as a specific response to writings of [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and of the [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1743–1794).

The ''Essay'' gave rise to the '''Malthusian controversy''' during the next decades. The content saw an emphasis on the [[birth rate]] and [[marriage rates]]. The '''neo-Malthusian controversy''', or related debates of many years later, has seen a similar central role assigned to the numbers of children born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G. Talbot Griffith|title=Population Problems of the Age of Malthus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NkUoqtdA4oAC&amp;pg=PA97|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=9 December 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-17863-1|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1799 Malthus made a European tour with [[William Otter]], a close college friend, travelling part of the way with [[Edward Daniel Clarke]] and John Marten Cripps, visiting Germany, Scandinavia and Russia. Malthus used the trip to gather population data. Otter later wrote a ''Memoir'' of Malthus for the second (1836) edition of his ''Principles of Political Economy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Otter, William|volume=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=20935|title=Otter, William|first=Arthur|last=Burns}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Peace of Amiens]] of 1802 he travelled to France and Switzerland, in a party that included his relation and future wife Harriet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat Condorcet (marquès de)|author2=William Godwin|author3=Thomas Robert Malthus|title=Progress, Poverty and Population: Re-Reading Condorcet, Godwin and Malthus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZA0lNlvbh0sC&amp;pg=PA64|accessdate=14 June 2013|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7146-4750-0|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1803 he became rector of [[Walesby, Lincolnshire]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Academic==
In 1805 Malthus became Professor of History and Political Economy at the [[East India Company College]] in [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T. R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Oxford World's Classics reprint: xxix Chronology.&lt;/ref&gt; His students affectionately referred to him as "Pop" or "Population" Malthus.

At the end of 1816 the proposed appointment of [[Graves Champney Haughton]] to the College was made a pretext by Randle Jackson and [[Joseph Hume]] to launch an attempt to close it down. Malthus wrote a pamphlet defending the College, which was reprieved by the East India Company in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Robert Malthus|title=T.R. Malthus: The Unpublished Papers in the Collection of Kanto Gakuen University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AgghdjSxQEC&amp;pg=PA120|accessdate=14 June 2013|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58138-7|page=120 notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1818 Malthus became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]].

==Malthus–Ricardo debate on political economy==
During the 1820s there took place a setpiece intellectual discussion within the proponents of [[political economy]], often called the "Malthus–Ricardo debate", after the leading figures of Malthus and [[David Ricardo]], a theorist of [[free trade]], both of whom had written books with the title ''Principles of Political Economy''. Under examination were the nature and methods of political economy itself, while it was simultaneously under attack from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Mary Poovey]]|title=A History of the Modern Fact: Problems of Knowledge in the Sciences of Wealth and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cf7ProAtFBkC&amp;pg=PA295|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=1 December 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-67525-1|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of the debate were in the previous decade. In ''The Nature of Rent'' (1815), Malthus had dealt with [[economic rent]], a major concept in classical economics. Ricardo defined a theory of rent in his ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (1817): he regarded rent as value in excess of real production—something caused by ownership rather than by free trade. Rent therefore represented a kind of negative money that landlords could pull out of the production of the land, by means of its scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;''On The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'', London: John Murray, Albemarle-Street, by David Ricardo, 1817 (third edition 1821)&amp;nbsp;– Chapter 6, On Profits: paragraph 28, "Thus, taking the former ..." and paragraph 33, "There can, however ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to this concept, Malthus proposed rent to be a kind of [[economic surplus]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The debate developed over the economic concept of a [[general glut]], and the possibility of failure of [[Say's Law]]. Malthus laid importance on [[economic development]] and the persistence of [[disequilibrium (economics)|disequilibrium]].&lt;ref name="S193"&gt;Sowell, pp. 193–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The context was the post-war depression; Malthus had a supporter in [[William Blake (economist)|William Blake]], in denying that [[capital accumulation]] (saving) was always good in such circumstances, and [[John Stuart Mill]] attacked Blake on the fringes of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Donald Winch]]|title=Riches and Poverty: An Intellectual History of Political Economy in Britain, 1750–1834|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiWojsCk0_8C&amp;pg=PA365|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=26 January 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55920-1|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricardo corresponded with Malthus from 1817 and his ''Principles''. He was drawn into considering political economy in a less restricted sense, which might be adapted to legislation and its multiple objectives, by the thought of Malthus. In his own work ''Principles of Political Economy'' (1820), and elsewhere, Malthus addressed the tension, amounting to conflict, he saw between a narrow view of political economy, and the broader moral and political plane.&lt;ref name="ColliniWinch1983"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stefan Collini]]|author2=[[Donald Winch]]|author3=[[John Wyon Burrow]]|title=That Noble Science of Politics: A Study in Nineteenth Century Intellectual History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E688AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=14 June 2013|year=1983|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-27770-9|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leslie Stephen]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Malthus and Ricardo differed, it was a difference of men who accepted the same first principles.

After Ricardo's death in 1823, Malthus became isolated among the younger British political economists, who tended to think he had lost the debate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}It is now considered that the different purposes seen by Malthus and Ricardo for political economy affected their technical discussion, and contributed to the lack of compatible definitions.&lt;ref name="S193"/&gt; For example, [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] used a definition of production based on [[goods and services]] and so queried the restriction of Malthus to "goods" alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Hollander|title=Jean-Baptiste Say and the Classical Canon in Economics: The British Connection in French Classicism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZdF-SECz9cC&amp;pg=PA170|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=14 January 2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-02228-3|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of public policy, Malthus was a supporter of the protectionist [[Corn Laws]] from the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He emerged as the only economist of note to support duties on imported grain.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Oxford World's Classics reprint. xx in Oxford World's Classics reprint. xx&lt;/ref&gt; He changed his mind after 1814.

==Later life==
Malthus was a founding member of the [[Political Economy Club]] in 1821; there [[John Cazenove]] tended to be his ally, against Ricardo and Mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Robert Malthus|title=Principles of Political Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjs1DUxjFr8C&amp;pg=PR58|accessdate=14 June 2013|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-24775-7|page=lxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected in the beginning of 1824 as one of the ten royal associates of the [[Royal Society of Literature]]. He was also one of the first fellows of the [[Statistical Society]], founded in March 1834. In 1827 he gave evidence to a committee of the House of Commons on emigration.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Malthus, Thomas Robert|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827, he published ''Definitions in Political Economy, preceded by an inquiry into the rules which ought to guide political economists in the definition and use of their terms; with remarks on the deviation from these rules in their writings.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malthus|first1=Thomas Robert|title=Definitions in Political Economy|date=1827|publisher=John Murray|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first chapter put forth "Rules for the Definition and Application of Terms in Political Economy". In chapter 10, the penultimate chapter, he presented 60 numbered paragraphs putting forth terms and their definitions that he proposed, following those rules, should be used in discussing political economy. This collection of terms and definitions is remarkable for two reasons: first, Malthus was the first economist to explicitly organize, define, and publish his terms as a coherent glossary of defined terms; and second, his definitions were, for the most part, well-formed definitional statements.
Between these chapters, he criticized several contemporary economists—[[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]], [[John Ramsay McCulloch]], and [[Samuel Bailey]]—for sloppiness in choosing, attaching meaning to, and using their technical terms.&lt;ref name="Definitions in Political Economy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malthus|first1=Thomas Robert|title=Definitions in Political Economy|date=2016|publisher=Berkeley Bridge Press|location=McLean|isbn=978-1-945208-01-0|url=http://www.politics-prose.com/book/9781945208010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCulloch was the editor of ''The Scotsman'' of Edinburgh; he replied cuttingly in a review printed on the front page of his newspaper in March, 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCulloch|first1=John Ramsay|title=A Review of Definitions in Political Economy by the Rev. T. R. Malthus|journal=The Scotsman|date=1827-03-10|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He implied that Malthus wanted to dictate terms and theories to other economists. McCulloch clearly felt his ox gored, and his review of ''Definitions'' is largely a bitter defence of his own ''Principles of Political Economy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCulloch|first1=John Ramsay|title=The Principles of Political Economy|date=1825|publisher=William &amp; Charles Tait|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his counter-attack "does little credit to his reputation", being largely "personal derogation" of Malthus.&lt;ref&gt;Morton Paglin's "Introduction" to: {{cite book|last1=Malthus|first1=Thomas Robert|title=Definitions in Political Economy|date=1986|publisher=Augustus M. Kelley|location=Fairfield, New Jersey|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of Malthus's ''Definitions'' was terminological clarity, and Malthus discussed appropriate terms, their definitions, and their use by himself and his contemporaries. This motivation of Malthus's work was disregarded by McCulloch, who responded that there was nothing to be gained "by carping at definitions, and quibbling about the meaning to be attached to" words. Given that statement, it is not surprising that McCulloch's review failed to address the rules of chapter 1 and did not discuss the definitions of chapter 10; he also barely mentioned Malthus's critiques of other writers.&lt;ref name="Definitions in Political Economy"/&gt;

In spite of this, in the wake of McCulloch's scathing review, the reputation of Malthus as economist dropped away, for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Huzel2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=James P. Huzel|title=The Popularization of Malthus in Early Nineteenth-Century England: Martineau, Cobbett And the Pauper Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPNic3dUOacC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5427-8|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Malthus did have supporters: [[Thomas Chalmers]], some of the [[Oriel Noetics]], [[Richard Jones (economist)|Richard Jones]] and [[William Whewell]] from Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Winch|title=Riches and Poverty: An Intellectual History of Political Economy in Britain, 1750–1834|date=26 January 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55920-1|pages=371–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus died suddenly of [[heart disease]] on 23 December 1834, at his father-in-law's house. He was buried in [[Bath Abbey]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; His portrait,&lt;ref&gt;Painted by [[John Linnell (painter)|Linnell]], and seen here in a cropped and scanned monochrome version.&lt;/ref&gt; and descriptions by contemporaries, present him as tall and good-looking, but with a [[cleft lip and palate]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, M.H. 2004.

''Autobiography''. 3 vols, Smith, Elder, London. vol 1, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
On 13 March 1804, Malthus married Harriet, daughter of John Eckersall of Claverton House, near Bath. They had a son and two daughters. His firstborn, son Henry, became vicar of [[Effingham, Surrey]], in 1835, and of [[Donnington, West Sussex|Donnington, Sussex]], in 1837; he married Sofia Otter (1807–1889), daughter of [[William Otter|Bishop William Otter]], and died in August 1882, aged 76. His middle child, Emily, died in 1885, outliving her parents and siblings. The youngest, Lucille, died unmarried and childless in 1825, months before her 18th birthday.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==''An Essay on the Principle of Population''==
{{Main|An Essay on the Principle of Population}}
Malthus argued in his ''Essay'' (1798) that population growth generally expanded in times and in regions of plenty until the size of the population relative to the primary resources caused distress:
{{quote|Yet in all societies, even those that are most vicious, the tendency to a virtuous attachment [i.e., marriage] is so strong that there is a constant effort towards an increase of population. This constant effort as constantly tends to subject the lower classes of the society to distress and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their condition.|Malthus, T.&amp;nbsp;R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population.'' Chapter II, p. 18 in [[Oxford World's Classics]] reprint.}}

Malthus argued that two types of checks hold population within resource limits: ''positive'' checks, which raise the death rate; and ''preventive'' ones, which lower the birth rate. The positive checks include hunger, disease and war; the preventive checks: [[birth control]], postponement of marriage and [[celibacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Oxford World's Classics reprint. viii&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid increase in the global population of the past century exemplifies Malthus's predicted population patterns; it also appears to describe socio-demographic dynamics of complex [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]]. These findings are the basis for neo-malthusian modern mathematical models of ''long-term historical dynamics''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Peter Turchin]] 2003; [http://cliodynamics.info/PDF/Turchin_Korotayev_SEH_2006.pdf Turchin and Korotayev 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229202712/http://cliodynamics.info/PDF/Turchin_Korotayev_SEH_2006.pdf |date=29 February 2012 }}; Peter Turchin et al. 2007; [[Korotayev]] et al. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus wrote that in a period of resource abundance, a population could double in 25 years. However, the margin of abundance could not be sustained as population grew, leading to checks on population growth:
{{quote|If the subsistence for man that the earth affords was to be increased every twenty-five years by a quantity equal to what the whole world at present produces, this would allow the power of production in the earth to be absolutely unlimited, and its ratio of increase much greater than we can conceive that any possible exertions of mankind could make it ... yet still the power of population being a power of a superior order, the increase of the human species can only be kept commensurate to the increase of the means of subsistence by the constant operation of the strong law of necessity acting as a check upon the greater power.|Malthus T. R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Chapter 2, p. 8&lt;ref name="Oxford World's Classics reprint"&gt;Oxford World's Classics reprint&lt;/ref&gt;}}In later editions of his essay, Malthus clarified his view that if society relied on human misery to limit population growth, then sources of misery (''e.g.'', hunger, disease, and war) would inevitably afflict society, as would volatile economic cycles. On the other hand, "preventive checks" to population that limited birthrates, such as later marriages, could ensure a higher standard of living for all, while also increasing economic stability.&lt;ref&gt;Essay (1826), I:2. See also A:1:17&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding possibilities for freeing man from these limits, Malthus argued against a variety of imaginable solutions, such as the notion that agricultural improvements could expand without limit.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Of the relationship between population and economics, Malthus wrote that when the population of laborers grows faster than the production of food, real wages fall because the growing population causes the [[cost of living]] (''i.e.'', the cost of food) to go up. Difficulties of raising a family eventually reduce the rate of population growth, until the falling population again leads to higher real wages.

In the second and subsequent editions Malthus put more emphasis on ''moral restraint'' as the best means of easing the poverty of the lower classes."&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Oxford World's Classics reprint, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works==

===1800: ''The present high price of provisions''===
In this work, his first published pamphlet, Malthus argues against the notion prevailing in his locale that the greed of intermediaries caused the high price of provisions. Instead, Malthus says that the high price stems from the [[Poor Laws]], which "increase the parish allowances in proportion to the price of corn." Thus, given a limited supply, the Poor Laws force up the price of daily necessities. But he concludes by saying that in time of scarcity such Poor Laws, by raising the price of corn more evenly, actually produce a ''beneficial'' effect.&lt;ref&gt;1800: ''The present high price of provisions'', paragraph 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===1814: ''Observations on the effects of the Corn Laws''===
Although government in Britain had regulated the prices of grain, the [[Corn Laws]] originated in 1815. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars that year, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] passed legislation banning the importation of foreign corn into Britain until domestic corn cost 80 shillings per [[hundredweight|quarter]].{{clarify|date=April 2018}} The high price caused the cost of food to increase and caused distress among the working classes in the towns. It led to serious rioting in London and to the [[Peterloo Massacre]] in [[Manchester]] in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;Hirst F. W. 1925. ''From Adam Smith to Philip Snowden: a history of free trade in Great Britain''. Unwin, London. p88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also: "The Corn Laws... safeguarded farmers from the consequences of their wartime euphoria, when farms had changed hands at the fanciest prices, loans and mortgages had been accepted on impossible terms." Eric Hobsbawm 1999. ''Industry and Empire: the birth of the Industrial Revolution'', p. 175&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In this pamphlet, printed during the parliamentary discussion, Malthus tentatively supported the free-traders. He argued that given the increasing cost of growing British corn, advantages accrued from supplementing it from cheaper foreign sources.

===1820: ''Principles of political economy''===
In 1820 Malthus published [[Principles of Political Economy (Malthus)|Principles of Political Economy]].
1836: Second edition, posthumously published. Malthus intended this work to rival Ricardo's ''Principles'' (1817).&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite journal|last=Malthus|first=Thomas Robert|year=1820|title=Principles of Political Economy Considered with a View of their Practical Application|edition=1|publisher=John Murray|publication-date=1820|publication-place=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b_dBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR1|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It, and his 1827 ''Definitions in political economy'', defended [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi|Sismondi]]'s views on "general glut" rather than Say's Law, which in effect states "there can be no general glut".{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Reception and influence==
{{details|An Essay on the Principle of Population#Reception and influence}}
Malthus developed the theory of demand-supply mismatches that he called [[Overproduction|gluts]]. Discounted at the time, this theory foreshadowed later works of an admirer, [[John Maynard Keynes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven G. Medema|author2=Warren J. Samuels|title=The History of Economic Thought: A Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uY3TITTPxTIC&amp;pg=PA291|accessdate=14 June 2013|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-20550-4|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast bulk of continuing commentary on Malthus, however, extends and expands on the "Malthusian controversy" of the early 19th century.

In general, Dickens had some Malthusian concerns (evident in ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', ''[[Hard Times (novel)|Hard Times]]'' and other novels), and he concentrated his attacks on [[Utilitarianism]] and many of its proponents, like [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]], whom he thought of, along with Malthus, as unjust and inhumane people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paroissien|first=David|title=A companion to Charles Dickens|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rATJ49kDnj8C&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq#v|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=1-4051-3097-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epitaph==
[[File:Epitaph of Thomas Malthus.jpg|thumb|right|The [[epitaph]] of Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus, just inside the entrance to [[Bath Abbey]].]]

The epitaph of Malthus in Bath Abbey reads [with commas inserted for clarity]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sacred to the memory of the Rev THOMAS ROBERT MALTHUS, long known to the lettered world by his admirable writings on the social branches of political economy, particularly by his essay on population.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the best men and truest philosophers of any age or country, raised by native dignity of mind above the misrepresentation of the ignorant and the neglect of the great, he lived a serene and happy life devoted to the pursuit and communication of truth, supported by a calm but firm conviction of the usefulness of his labours, content with the approbation of the wise and good.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;His writings will be a lasting monument of the extent and correctness of his understanding.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The spotless integrity of his principles, the equity and candour of his nature, his sweetness of temper, urbanity of manners and tenderness of heart, his benevolence and his piety are still dearer recollections of his family and friends.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Born February 14, 1766 - Died 29 December 1834.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Voices of Transition''''' (Cultures en Transition in French) is a 2012&lt;ref name=IMDB_Listing&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1920884/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|accessdate=11 April 2014|title=Voices of Transition (2012)|work=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt; documentary film by f[[Film Director|ilm director]] and producer Nils Aguilar. The film was produced in France and Germany and examines the danger posed to [[agricultural production]] by energy and resource scarcity. It depicts organic agricultural alternatives in France, the [[Transition Towns]] movement and urbanised food production in [[Cuba]] as forerunners of the transformation of food production away from industrialised agriculture and towards small-scale, decentralised production methods.&lt;ref name=Film_Dienst_article&gt;{{cite web|last=Lücke|first=Reinhard|title=Voices of Transition|url=http://issuu.com/filmdienst/docs/film-dienst22_2012?e=4932611/3795111|work=Film Dienst|publisher=dreipunktdrei mediengesellschaft mbh|accessdate=11 April 2014|page=29|language=German|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German cinema debut was held on 2 May 2013&lt;ref name=Filmstart&gt;{{cite web|title=Voices of Transition|url=http://www.filmstarts.de/kritiken/194801.html|work=Filmstarts|accessdate=11 April 2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a wider German cinema tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kino-Tour 2013|url=http://voicesoftransition.org/de/film-sehen/vorfuehr-termine/kino-tour-2013|work=Voices of Transition|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed or preceded by theatrical releases and tours in Italy&lt;sup&gt;[[Voices of Transition#cite note-34|[34]]]&lt;/sup&gt;, USA&lt;sup&gt;[[Voices of Transition#cite note-35|[35]]]&lt;/sup&gt;, Portugal&lt;sup&gt;[[Voices of Transition#cite note-36|[36]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Wallonia&lt;sup&gt;[[Voices of Transition#cite note-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and Flanders&lt;sup&gt;[[Voices of Transition#cite note-6|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt; (Belgium), Great Britain&lt;sup&gt;[[Voices of Transition#cite note-7|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt;, Argentina and Chile.&lt;sup&gt;[[Voices of Transition#cite note-9|[9]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Plot ==

Using interviews and overlays of graphics and text, the film presents the current problems facing [[industrial agriculture]]. It explores why in the interviewees' view the current industrial model is not up to the task of feeding the world's people. According to the film every [[calorie]] of energy contained in a food source currently takes between 10 and 20 calories of [[crude oil]] in the production of [[fertilizers]] and transportation to produce, leading to a strong dependence of the cost of food on [[oil prices]]. As a result of [[peak oil]] and increasing oil prices this dependence will lead to ever increasing food prices. According to the film, this dependence already represents a significant weak-spot in the global food [[supply chain]].&lt;ref name=tagblatt.de&gt;{{cite web|last=Keicher|first=Fred|title=Der Tübinger Nils Aguilar und sein Film "Voices of Transition"|url=http://www.tagblatt.de/Home/kino/filmregion_artikel,-Der-Tuebinger-Nils-Aguilar-und-sein-Film-Voices-of-Transition-_arid,197434.html|work=tagblatt.de|publisher=Schwäbisches Tagblatt|accessdate=11 April 2014|language=German|date=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, agriculture is already responsible for 40% of [[greenhouse gas emissions]], contributing to [[climate change]]. Furthermore, the film argues that the overuse of inorganic [[fertilizers]] has been responsible for the loss of [[soil fertility]] and threatens the complete loss of usable soil within the next decades through [[soil erosion]] and sinking [[crop yields]].  These effects, according to the film, can only be partly mitigated by the increased use of those same fertilizers. The loss of workplaces, the concentration of land in the hands of a few (allegedly a farm closes every 23 minutes in France) as well as the dependence on large corporations are enumerated as side effects of the industrialisation of agriculture since the 1920s. Companies, such as [[Monsanto]] and [[Bayer]], control everything from seed stock to fertilizers and the necessary chemical mixes for hybrid plants, thereby controlling the entire supply chain. The film argues that this development was supported through subsidies from the [[World Bank]]. Interviews with [[Vandana Shiva]], the founder of the [[Transition Towns]] movement [[Rob Hopkins]] and various agricultural experts serve to argue this viewpoint. The dependence on [[crude oil]] is illustrated through the example of the wholesale food market in [[Rungis]].

[[File:Voices of Transition Vaches normandes.png|thumb|Agroforestry in [[Normandy]]]]
To illustrate alternative scenarios the documentary visits places in England and France to conduct various interviews. [[Agroforestry]] expert [[Martin Crawford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Crawford|url=http://www.greenbooks.co.uk/Contributor/58/Martin-Crawford.html|work=Green Books|publisher=Green Books|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a tour of his [[forest garden]], explaining how the assortment of different plants on various levels results in a [[symbiotic relationship]] between them whereby they supply each other with [[nutrients]]. He explains the high productivity rate and efficiencies realised through the use of these [[Permaculture]] principles. A further application is shown on farmlands, where rows of trees are planted with cereal crops in between. As a result, the later can still be harvested using large-scale machinery, while the trees provide a better [[microclimate]] by providing living space for animals, much higher rates of [[biodiversity]] and a replenishing of the soil as a result of the regular loss of root structures. According to the interviewees in the film the trees themselves could provide a counterbalance to the deficit of wood in European countries, act as carbon sinks and contribute to the value of the land. As experts on these matters the film presents Christian Dupraz&lt;ref name=Christian_Dupraz&gt;{{cite web|last=Dupraz|first=Christian|url=http://christiandupraz.eelv.fr/|work=Private website of Christian Dupraz|accessdate=11 April 2014|language=French|title=Christian Dupraz}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the French Institut national de la Recherche Agronomique as well as French [[soil scientist]] Claude Bourguignon.

[[File:Voices of Transition Rob Hopkins.png|thumb|[[Rob Hopkins]]]]
The second part of the film depicts the British [[Transition Towns]] initiative, whose local actors claim to promote a more liveable future by building resilient structures in anticipation of the threats of [[peak oil]], [[climate change]] and [[economic crises]].&lt;ref name=tagblatt.de /&gt; The film shows Permaculture gardener Mike Feingold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stanley|first=Bruce|title=Mike Feingold's Permaculture Allotment|url=http://www.embody.co.uk/blog/post/mike_feingolds_permaculture_allotment|work=Embody|accessdate=11 April 2014|date=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he works in his [[allotment (gardening)|allotment]] and whilst making apple juice from apples he has harvested himself. Further, the film highlights barter markets, [[local currencies]] such as the [[Totnes Pound]]&lt;ref name=The_Independent&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharp|first=Rob|title=They don't just shop local in Totnes – they have their very own currency|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/they-dont-just-shop-local-in-totnes--they-have-their-very-own-currency-818586.html|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent Print Limited|accessdate=11 April 2014|date=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and events where plants are planted with the goal of making 'edible cities'. Sally Jenkins, as representative for the project Grofun (Growing Real Organic Food in Urban Neighbourhoods)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leendertz|first=Lia|title=Could Grofun get you gardening?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2009/apr/07/gardens|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|accessdate=11 April 2014|date=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows how she plants food in her front yard to inspire her neighbours to do the same. Co-founder of the initiative [[Rob Hopkins]], who stresses the importance of building a vision that will be able to carry people through the decades to come, further explains the whole movement. According to him this will act both as the means to jointly prepare for looming crises while simultaneously re-learning to enjoy life.

[[File:Voices of Transition Mitglieder Cooperativa Alamar.png|thumb|Cooperative Alamar, Cuba]]
The final third of the film turns to [[Cuba]], whose agriculture was cut off from the use of [[crude oil]] and global food markets at the beginning of the 1990s due to the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. As a result, [[community gardens]] and [[urban agriculture]] developed, in which organically grown food is produced. The film claims that the Cuban capital [[Havana]] is able to source 70% of its fresh vegetable needs directly within the city or its immediate surroundings,&lt;ref name=Film_Dienst_article /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Funes, Altieri &amp; Rosset|title=The Avery Diet: The Hudson Institute’s Misinformation Campaign Against Cuban Agriculture|url=http://globalalternatives.org/files/AveryCubaDiet.pdf|work=globalalternatives.org|accessdate=11 April 2014|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a yield of up to 20&amp;nbsp;kg per square meter. Fernando Funes-Monzote, co-founder of the Grupo de Agricultura Organica (winners of the 1999 Right Livelihood Award)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fairweather &amp; Asquith|title=How Can Cuba's Sustainable Agriculture Survive the Peace?|url=http://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/node/554|work=Solutions|publisher=The Solutions Journal|accessdate=11 April 2014|pages=56–58|date=Feb 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; appears as the main interviewee. He claims that [[Cuba]] must be the only country which is close to developing a [[sustainable]] food supply, a claim which is supported by a [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] study according to which [[Cuba]] is the only country to fulfil the minimal criteria for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=WWF_Report&gt;{{cite web|last=Hails|first=Chris (ed.)|title=Living Planet Report 2006|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/download.php?id=303|work=Living Planet Report 2006|publisher=WWF International, Zoological Society of London and Global Footprint Network|accessdate=11 April 2014|page=19|year=2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126170600/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/download.php?id=303|archive-date=26 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governmental support of urban agriculture has led to a higher degree of [[food sovereignty]] and a degree of independence from the world market and oil prices. Because of this, Cuba's forced development could serve as an example for other countries whose resource shortages are yet to come.

== Background ==

Director Nils Aguilar explained in an interview that he was "deeply moved"&lt;ref name=Woynowski&gt;{{cite web|last=Woynowski|first=Boris et. al.|title=Im Gespräch mit: Nils Aguilar  – Globale Transition-Initiativen|url=http://www.ife.uni-freiburg.de/wachstumswende/interview-nils-aguilar.pdf|work=Wirtschaft ohne Wachstum?! Notwendigkeit und Ansätze einer Wachstumswende|publisher=Arbeitsberichte des Instituts für Forstökonomie|accessdate=11 April 2014|pages=378–379|language=German|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the experience of large agricultural companies using thugs to silence indigenous groups protesting against their displacement in Argentina. Examining concepts such as permaculture since 2003 and the themes of the book ''Le Sol, la Terre et les Champs'' by French soil scientist Claude Bourguignon further inspired him to make the film,&lt;ref name=Woynowski2&gt;{{cite web|last=Woynowski|first=Boris et. al.|title=Im Gespräch mit: Nils Aguilar  – Globale Transition-Initiativen|url=http://www.ife.uni-freiburg.de/wachstumswende/interview-nils-aguilar.pdf|work=Wirtschaft ohne Wachstum?! Notwendigkeit und Ansätze einer Wachstumswende|publisher=Arbeitsberichte des Instituts für Forstökonomie|accessdate=11 April 2014|page=379|language=German|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to "…inspire action by showing positive solutions."&lt;ref name=Woynowski/&gt;

The stated aim of the project is to give the [[Transition Towns]] Movement an educational tool with which to promote organic agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Voices of Transition|url=http://voicesoftransition.org/about|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aguilar, born 1980 in [[Tübingen]],&lt;ref name=tagblatt.de /&gt; started the project with a Co-Director who left the film early on as he "…didn't really believe in it."&lt;ref name=Woynowski3&gt;{{cite web|last=Woynowski|first=Boris et. al.|title=Im Gespräch mit: Nils Aguilar  – Globale Transition-Initiativen|url=http://www.ife.uni-freiburg.de/wachstumswende/interview-nils-aguilar.pdf|work=Wirtschaft ohne Wachstum?! Notwendigkeit und Ansätze einer Wachstumswende|publisher=Arbeitsberichte des Instituts für Forstökonomie|accessdate=11 April 2014|pages=383|language=German|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Aguilar decided to master the project as a "non-specialist autodidact", which took around four years.&lt;ref name=Woynowski3/&gt;

The film depended in large part on voluntary help, as a result of the fact that the Director himself produced the [[low-budget film]].&lt;ref name=tagblatt.de /&gt; The film was supported by the European Union Programme Youth in Action and the French Ministry of Youth's Envie d'agir Programme.&lt;ref name=Funders&amp;Partners&gt;{{cite web|title=Funders &amp; Partners – Voices of Transition|url=http://voicesoftransition.org/support/funders-and-partners|work=voicesoftransition.org|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two successful crowdfunding campaigns also contributed to the making of the documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voices of Transition|url=http://www.sponsume.com/project/voices-transition|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312220451/http://www.sponsume.com/project/voices-transition|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 March 2011|work=sponsume.com|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voices of Transition|url=http://www.startnext.de/voices-of-transition|work=startnext.de|accessdate=11 April 2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is being independently distributed in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voices of Transition – Distribution|url=http://voicesoftransition.org/distribution|work=voicesoftransition.org|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Screenings ==

A very first prescreening of the yet unfinalised film was organised during the [[Transition Towns]] movement conference in [[Hannover]] in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transition Konferenz Programm|url=http://www.wissenschaftsladen-hannover.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Publikationen/Transition_Konferenz_Hannover_Programm__bersicht_Version_3_von_16-11-2010.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2014|page=6|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Festival Alimenterre 2013" screened the film 192 times in African and French speaking countries, eventually reaching 12.520 auditors &lt;sup&gt;[[Voices of Transition#cite note-32|[32]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.

The [[Cinema Politica]] Festival screened the film in six Canadian universities. &lt;sup&gt;[[Voices of Transition#cite note-33|[33]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

The film has been broadcast in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Channel|url=http://www.realfoodrev.co.uk/full-documentaries|accessdate=19 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Hungary, Romania, Slovenia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ORF|url=http://contentsales.orf.at/rte/upload/presse/press_review/2014/oejournal_zahlreiche_orfprogrammverkaeufe_bei_den_german_screenings_2014.pdf|accessdate=19 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ORF|url=http://contentsales.orf.at/rte/upload/presse/press_review/2015/worldscreen_orfenterprise_sells_factual_content_more_at_german_screenings.pdf|accessdate=19 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Reid became the first [[African-American]] elected to the [[Virginia Assembly]] since the days of [[Civil War (US)|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref name="virginia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/political/william_reid.htm|title=William Ferguson Reid|work=virginia.gov|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won re-election twice to the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], representing Richmond and part of surrounding [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico County]].

==Early and family life==
Fergie Reid was born in Richmond on March 18, 1925, the son of dentist Leon Reid and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Stop #12 on [[Maggie Walker]] Tour{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/mawa/learn/photosmultimedia/upload/Jackson-Ward-Podcast-transcription.pdf |format=PDF |title=Jackson Ward Podcast |publisher=Nps.gov |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in a house next to that of prominent banker and activist [[Maggie L. Walker]] at 110 Leigh Street in Richmond's [[Jackson Ward]]. Both houses shared the same street number, and one day "a courtly man with a Van Dyke beard" appeared at the Reid family's door, mistaking it for the Walker residence. The stranger proved to be scholar and civil rights activist [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Times-Dispatch|first1=JEFF E.

Walker died in 1934, but long remembered her vividly, "She was widowed and living with her children and grandchildren . . . . Naturally we were together every day in our house or their house; so we were very close." He could name Walker's grandchildren-- "Maggie, Laura, Armistead, Mamie Evelyn and Elizabeth"—and that Elizabeth was his age.&lt;ref name="Richmond Times-Dispatch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schapio|first1=Jeff E.|title='Miss Maggie' was neighbor of another Va. history-maker|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=July 30, 2017|location=Richmond, Virginia|pages=B1, B10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stop #12 on [[Maggie Walker]] Tour{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/mawa/learn/photosmultimedia/upload/Jackson-Ward-Podcast-transcription.pdf |format=PDF |title=Jackson Ward Podcast |publisher=Nps.gov |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 Reid graduated from [[Armstrong High School (Virginia)|Armstrong High School]], and in 1946 he received his bachelor's degree from [[Virginia Union University]]. He earned his medical degree from [[Howard University]], and served his internship and residency as a surgeon in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="Dispatch"/&gt;

After the civil rights events described below, Reid and his wife eventually moved to [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Richmond Times-Dispatch"/&gt; Both their daughters and son (William Ferguson Reid, Jr.) became physicians, with the daughters practicing in Maryland and New Jersey and their son in [[Hollywood, California]].&lt;ref name="Dispatch"/&gt; Reid was active in his [[Episcopal Church (USA)|Episcopal Church]] and the [[Salvation Army]], as well as with [[Omega Psi Phi]] and became a 32nd degree Mason.&lt;ref name="dela.state.va.us"&gt;http://dela.state.va.us/dela/Membios.nsf/94f6e9b9c9b5678f85256b1b00732227/4befa4ea29a5671285256c4c005621c2?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Dr. Reid served as a lieutenant in the [[United States Navy]] during  the [[Korean War]], with the [[1st Marine Division]], and later at the [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] in Maryland. Returning to Richmond, he became active in civic and professional affairs. He served on the staff of  Richmond Memorial Hospital, Richmond Community Hospital, Retreat for the Sick, [[Medical College of Virginia]] and [[St. Mary's Hospital (Richmond)|St. Mary's Hospital]]. His professional associations included the [[American College of Surgeons]], [[Richmond Academy of Medicine]], Richmond Medical Society, [[Medical Society of Virginia]], Old Dominion Medical Society, [[American Medical Association]] and the National Medical Association. He became a diplomate of the American Board of Surgery in 1955.&lt;ref name="ABS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Check a certification |url=https://www.absurgery.org/app.jsp?bounce=app_vc_searchvc |publisher=[[American Board of Surgery]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil rights activism==

Reid co-founded the Richmond Crusade for Voters in 1956. He hoped to register and mobilize black voters during [[Massive Resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nurturing the Roots: 90for90 and Black Political Power|url=http://progressive.org/dispatches/nurturing-roots-90for90-black-political-power/|accessdate=26 May 2018|work=Progressive.org|date=15 July 2016|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[de facto]] member of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Senator [[Harry F. Byrd Sr.]] and his Democratic political machine in Virginia largely controlled statewide politics. According to Michael Paul Williams of the [[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]: "This was an era of poll taxes, literacy tests and other mechanisms to weaken black political clout. The entrenched Byrd [[political machine]] stood in defiance of change."&lt;ref name="Dispatch"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Michael Paul |title=Dr. William Ferguson Reid |url=https://www.richmond.com/special-section/black-history/dr-william-ferguson-reid/article_b26338cb-1e2d-5e59-94f9-be5d66da1787.html |accessdate=4 August 2018 |work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |date=10 February 2003 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid, John Mitchell Brooks and Dr. William S. Thornton began meeting daily at the old Slaughter's Hotel, a popular segregation-era gathering place for black Richmonders in [[Jackson Ward]]. The outgrowth of these strategy sessions was the Crusade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richmond.com/special-section/black-history/article_b26338cb-1e2d-5e59-94f9-be5d66da1787.html|title=Dr. William Ferguson Reid|work=Richmond Times-Dispatch|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailykos.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/04/19/1377788/-90-for-90-Getting-out-the-vote-in-Virginia#|title=90 for 90. Getting out the vote in Virginia|work=dailykos.com|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans gained national support with the Civil Rights Movement through the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965. An important outcome was Federal oversight and enforcement of voting rights. Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, decisions affecting elections became subject to clearance by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].

==Political career==

The Crusade had been formed in 1955 to register more voters to combat the racist politics driven by the era of "[[massive resistance]]," part of a Southern strategy to thwart the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s rulings that public schools be desegregated. "No civic organization did more to democratize local politics in 20th-century Richmond than the Crusade," opined [[University of Richmond]] history professor Dr. Julian Maxwell Hayter in his book, "The Dream Is Lost: Voting Rights and the Politics of Race in Richmond, Virginia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Bonnie Newman|title='We Decided to Start a Third Party'|url=http://richmondmagazine.com/news/sunday-story/we-decided-to-start-a-third-party/|website=richmondmagazine.com|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en-us|date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reid co-founded the Richmond Crusade for Voters with Dr. William Thornton, John M. Brooks, Ethel T. Overby and Lola Hamilton.

Despite the Crusade for Voters' continuing growth in influence, Reid's first two candidacies for public office failed. In 1965, he was 7th among the eight candidates seeking the five seats in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] representing Richmond (part-time positions). However, the [[Byrd Organization]] was crumbling. In early 1966, Virginia's [[Harry F. Byrd]] died of a brain tumor, and two of his prominent lieutenants, conservative Democrats, Rep. [[Howard W. Smith]] of [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]] and U. S. Senator [[A. Willis Robertson]], lost in the Democratic primary. In the summer of 1969, the Democratic Party engaged in a bitterly fought gubernatorial primary and "an exhausting run-off election which left the old organization fragmented and set the stage for "the election of [[Linwood Holton]]", a Republican who had lost his first gubernatorial run in 1965.&lt;ref name="richmond.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1350&amp;context=masters-theses |format=PDF |title=Linwood Holton's long quest for the governorship of Virginia and its impact on the growth of the Republican Party |publisher=Nps.gov |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[African American]] to be elected to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] since 1891, Reid took his seat in the lower chamber the following January, alongside [[Eleanor P. Sheppard]], who had opposed school closings and became Richmond's first female mayor. Others winning the nine seats in the [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] from Richmond City and [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico County-Richmond]] were veterans [[George E. Allen, Jr.]], [[Junie L. Bradshaw]], [[Thomas P. Bryan]], [[Ernst W. Farley, Jr.]], [[Edward E. Lane]], [[E. B. Pendleton, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia's General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) p. 749&lt;/ref&gt; Reid replaced prominent segregationist [[T. Coleman Andrews, Jr.]], a prominent segregationist who would found the [[American Independent Party]] in 1969 to support the presidential candidacy of George C. Wallace of Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;New York TImes obituary 4/20/1989&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1968, Virginians voted in record numbers for the second successive time in a presidential election since adoption of the [[24th Amendment]] removed the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] as a bar to participation in Federal elections.&lt;ref&gt; name="richmond.edu"&lt;/ref&gt; Reid would serve three terms in the [[Virginia General Assembly]], winning re-election in 1969 (when [[Carl E. Bain]] and [[B. Earl Dunn]] replaced Thomas P. Bryan and E.B. Pendleton).&lt;ref&gt;Leonard p. 755&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, after the 1970 census led to legislative reapportionment, [[Robert B. Ball Sr.]], [[Edwin H. Ragsdale]] and [[T. Dix Sutton]] were elected from Henrico County, Reid from the district of Henrico and Richmond City, and Allen, Bain, Lane, Sheppard and newcomer Philip B. Morris represented Richmond City.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard pp. 760, 762&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dela.state.va.us/dela/Membios.nsf/HSearch/?SearchView&amp;Query=%5BFullName%5D+Contains+william%20ferguson%20reid+&amp;SearchMax=&amp;SearchOrder=4&lt;/ref&gt; Although Reid was the only African American in the General Assembly when he took office in 1968, in 2000 there were fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Political|first1=Exhibitions:|title=William Ferguson Reid|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/political/william_reid.htm|website=Library of Virginia|publisher=Virginia|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Reid was defeated by colorful Richmond city councilman [[Howard Carwile]], also African-American, who vowed to "raise hell", but was defeated for re-election in 1975 by prominent lawyer [[Gerald L. Baliles]].&lt;ref&gt;Virginius Dabney, Richmond: the Story of a City (University of Virginia Press 1992) pp. 337-338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard pp. 767, 774&lt;/ref&gt;

After his final term as delegate ended, Dr. Reid then accepted a position as regional medical officer with the [[U.S. State Department]], which caused him to maintain a home in Washington, D.C.'s Maryland suburbs, as well as travel abroad. His activism then continued from a distance, as the Crusade for Voters helped win an African American majority on Richmond's City Council and elected [[Henry L. Marsh]] the city's first African American mayor in 1977.&lt;ref name="Dispatch"/&gt; Reid has also recorded an oral history for [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/voices/id/8 |title=Interview with Dr. W. Ferguson Reid :: Voices of Freedom |publisher=Dig.library.vcu.edu |date=2003-03-21 |accessdate=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Henrico County School Board in 2012 named a school in honor of Dr. William Ferguson Reid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Michael Paul |title=Williams: Name new Henrico school after Dr. William Ferguson Reid |url=http://www.richmond.com/news/williams-name-new-henrico-school-after-dr-william-ferguson-reid/article_45fa0fb0-164b-559d-b380-7f776c2b6915.html |work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |date=9 October 2012 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==90 for 90 campaign==
In honor of Reid's 90th birthday, in 2015 in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]], the 90 for 90 voter registration goal based on door-to-door volunteer canvassing began. The 90 for 90 voter outreach program spread throughout the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] and beyond.&lt;ref name="wsls.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dahl |first=Wills |url=http://baltimorepostexaminer.com/ferguson-reids-movement-can-bring-change-virginia/2015/02/22 |title=Ferguson Reid's movement can bring change to Virginia - Baltimore Post-ExaminerBaltimore Post-Examiner |publisher=Baltimorepostexaminer.com |date=2015-02-22 |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/04/04/1375598/-DKos-Asheville-Dr-Fergie-Reid-and-Jr-coming-to-Roanoke# |title=DKos Asheville: Dr. Fergie Reid and Jr coming to Roanoke |publisher=Dailykos.com |date=2015-04-04 |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Denise Oliver Valdez wrote for ''[[Daily Kos]]'' that "While much of the media is focusing on presidential hopefuls for 2016, the state of Virginia has key elections coming up this year—elections for the Virginia House of Delegates.... A unique effort is underway in Virginia to get voters registered and out to vote, not just this year, but in the election years to come. The impetus and inspiration behind this drive is a civil rights icon in Virginia, Dr. William Ferguson Reid, known to many as 'Fergie,' who was the first black man to win a seat in the Virginia General Assembly since Reconstruction."&lt;ref name="dailykos.com"/&gt;
