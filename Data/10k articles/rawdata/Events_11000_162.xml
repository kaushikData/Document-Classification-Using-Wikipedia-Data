'''{{mp|(341843) 2008 EV|5}}''', provisional designation {{mp|2008 EV|5}}, is a sub-kilometer [[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[Aten asteroid|Aten group]], approximately {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=off}} in diameter. It was discovered on 4 March 2008, by astronomers of the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] at [[Mount Lemmon Observatory]] near Tucson, Arizona, United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==
[[File:Asteroid-2008EV5-ShapeModel-20111006.gif|thumb|200px|left|Radar-based shape model of {{mp|2008 EV|5}}]]

{{mp|2008 EV|5}} is an [[oblate spheroid]] {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. It rotates very slowly in a [[Retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde]] direction. There is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} diameter [[Concave function|concave]] feature, possibly an [[impact crater]], or a relic feature from a previous episode of rapid rotation that caused the asteroid's shape to reconfigure.&lt;ref name="Busch-2011" /&gt;

Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy show that {{mp|2008 EV|5}}'s composition is similar to that of [[carbonaceous chondrite]] meteorites.&lt;ref name="Reddy-2012" /&gt;

== Sample return mission ==

{{mp|2008 EV|5}} is the preliminary baseline target of a proposed [[Sample return mission|sample-return]] [[NASA]] mission called [[Asteroid Redirect Mission|ARM]]. Besides the asteroid {{mp|2008 EV|5}}, several other asteroids, including [[25143 Itokawa|Itokawa]] and [[101955 Bennu|Bennu]], are being considered for this mission.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150325-DES" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20150325" /&gt;

== Origin and orbital history ==

{{mp|2008 EV|5}} started its existence as part of a much larger body in the asteroid belt, with a likely diameter greater than 100 kilometers.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli-2009" /&gt; {{mp|2008 EV|5}}'s immediate history likely started when its parent body experienced a large cratering event or, more likely, a catastrophic disruption event that resulted in a highly fractured, shattered, or reaccumulated object (rubble pile). As a result, {{mp|2008 EV|5}} may have been produced as a reassembly of ejected fragments. The location of what is now {{mp|2008 EV|5}} within this parent body is unknown.&lt;ref name="ARM" /&gt;

Given the available modeling work and data, the most plausible source family candidates for {{mp|2008 EV|5}} are [[495 Eulalia|Eulalia]], [[Nysa family|New Polana]], and [[163 Erigone|Erigone]]. This assumes that {{mp|2008 EV|5}}'s true albedo is considerably lower than 10%. If it does have a high albedo, a plausible source would be a population of high-albedo [[C-type asteroids]] in the inner asteroid belt. Second tier candidate families for the high-albedo case are [[Baptistina family|Baptistina]] and [[Pallas family|Pallas]].&lt;ref name="ARM" /&gt;

From here, the newly liberated {{mp|2008 EV|5}} began to change via the forces referred to as the [[Yarkovsky effect|Yarkovsky]] and [[Yarkovsky–O'Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack effect|YORP]] effects. The Yarkovsky effect describes a small force that affects orbital motion. It is caused by sunlight; when objects heat up in the Sun, they reradiate the energy away as heat, which in turn creates a tiny thrust. This recoil acceleration is much weaker than solar and planetary gravitational forces, but it can produce substantial orbital changes over timescales ranging from many millions to billions of years. The same physical phenomenon also creates a thermal torque that probably caused {{mp|2008 EV|5}} to take on a top-like appearance.&lt;ref name="Busch-2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ARM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh-2008" /&gt;

Dynamical models indicate that {{mp|2008 EV|5}} migrated inward across the inner asteroid belt over long timescales (i.e. the order of ~0.01–1 Gyr) until it reached a planetary gravitational resonance that drove it into the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population over a timescale of the order of ~1 Myr. From there, gravitational interactions with both the planets and resonances allowed it to reach its current orbit within a few Myr to a few tens of Myr.&lt;ref name="ARM"/&gt;

== 2008 close approach ==

On 23 December 2008, {{mp|2008 EV|5}} made a close approach to Earth at a distance of 8.4 lunar distances (0.022 AU, 3.2 million km), its closest until 2169.&lt;ref name="Busch-2011" /&gt; Its brightness peaked on December 26 about 13.2 [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]].

The '''1973 Paris Air Show crash''' was the crash of the second production [[Tupolev Tu-144]] at [[Goussainville, Val-d'Oise]], France, which killed all six crew and eight people on the {{nowrap|ground.&lt;ref name=srrsscr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8B5OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Pe0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6732%2C1543669 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington, U.S.) |agency=Associated Press |title=Russian SST crashes |date=June 4, 1973 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mlssv&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A_EjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dREEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6853%2C605260 |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |location=(Wisconsin, U.S.)|agency=UPI |title=Soviet SST crash kills 14 |date=June 4, 1973 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The crash, at the [[Paris Air Show]] on Sunday, 3 June {{nowrap|1973,&lt;ref name=fftnkld&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uJVAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IaUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2298%2C524076|work=Glasgow Herald  |title=15 killed as Russia's Concorde explodes |date=June 4, 1973 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} damaged the development program of the Tupolev Tu-144.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ina.fr/economie-et-societe/justice-et-faits-divers/video/CAF94004211/accident-tupolev-144-au-salon-du-bourget.fr.html " Crash of the Tupolev 144 on 3 June 1973 video."] [[Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française|ORTF]], 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. news broadcasting, 3 June 1973, on the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]] website , ina.fr.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the show, there was a "fierce competition between the Anglo-French Concorde and the Russian Tu-144".&lt;ref name="concordski" /&gt;  The Soviet pilot, Mikhail Kozlov, had bragged that he would outperform the Concorde.&lt;ref name="concordski" /&gt;  "Just wait until you see us fly," he was quoted as saying. "Then you'll see something."&lt;ref name = "deadly"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910688,00.html | title=DISASTERS: Deadly Exhibition | work=Time | date=18 June 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the final day of the show, the [[Concorde]], which was not yet in production, performed its demonstration flight first.&lt;ref name=concordski/&gt;  Its performance was later described as being unexciting, and it has been theorized that Kozlov was determined to show how much better his aircraft was.&lt;ref name = "deadly" /&gt;

Once in flight, the aircraft made what appeared to be a landing approach, with the landing gear out and the "moustache" canards extended, but then with all four engines full power, climbed rapidly. Possibly stalling below {{convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the aircraft pitched over and went into a steep dive.&lt;ref name="concordski" /&gt; Trying to pull out of the subsequent dive with the engines again at full power, the Tu-144 broke up in mid-air, possibly due to overstressing the airframe. The left wing came away first, and then the aircraft disintegrated and crashed,&lt;ref name="concordski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASN030672" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flight140673b" /&gt; destroying 15 houses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/06/05/327190/paris-air-show-100-years-of-paris-air-show-highlights.html|title=Paris Air Show: 100 years of Paris air show highlights|date=5 June 2009|website=Flightglobal|access-date=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and killing all six people on board the Tu-144 and eight more on the ground.&lt;ref name="ASN030672" /&gt; Three children were among those killed, and sixty people received severe injuries.&lt;ref name="nova" /&gt;

==Reactions==
The crew of the Tu-144 were buried at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow on 12 June 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%201708.html|title=Tu-144 investigation continues|date=21 June 1973|journal=Flight International |volume=103  |number=3354 |page=938 |access-date=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the crash, [[Marcel Dassault]] called for the 1975 Paris Air Show to be held at [[Istres-Le Tubé Air Base|Istres]], which is situated in open country {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} north west of [[Marseille]].&lt;ref name="Flight140673a"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Display dangers |journal=Flight International |number=3353 |volume=103|date=14 June 1973 |page=910 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%201650.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crash reduced the enthusiasm of [[Aeroflot]] for the Tu-144. Restrictions on the Tu-144 following the Paris Air Show crash meant that it only saw limited service during 1977 and 1978, and it was finally withdrawn following another crash in May 1978.&lt;ref name="aviation" /&gt; The Tu-144's rival, the Concorde, went on to serve with British Airways and Air France for 30 years afterwards, being finally withdrawn from service in 2003 due to rising service costs and the slump in the aviation industry following [[9/11]].   In 2000, Concorde [[Air France Flight 4590]] crashed in [[Paris]], [[France]] killing all 100 passengers &amp; 9 crew as well as 4 people on the ground.

==Causes==
===Investigation===
The accident was investigated by the DTCE&lt;!--what does this stand for?--&gt;, part of the [[French Armed Forces|French Military]], which was responsible for accidents involving prototype aircraft in France. The wreckage was recovered to a hangar at Le Bourget, with some of it being flown by [[Antonov An-22]] to the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Flight140673b" &gt;{{cite journal |title=Tu-144 crash investigation |journal=Flight International |date=14 June 1973 |page=908 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%201648.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories===
[[File:Le Bourget 1973 en.jpg|thumb|Flight profile of Tu-144 and Mirage IIIR{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}]]
[[File:Dassault_Mirage_IIIR.jpg|thumb|A French [[Dassault Mirage III]]R fighter jet. Shortly before the accident, a Mirage IIIR had taken off from the airport. A theory for the incident suggests that the Tu-144 swerved to avoid the Mirage and lost control, breaking up before impacting the ground.]]
One theory is that the Tu-144 manoeuvred to avoid a French [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage]] chase plane that was attempting to photograph its unique [[canard (aeronautics)|canards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/technology/ask_the_pilot/2005/06/24/askthepilot142/|title=Ask the pilot|last=Smith|first=Patrick|date=24 June 2005|work=Salon|access-date=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were advanced for the time, and that the French and Soviet governments colluded with each other to cover up such details.&lt;ref name="nova" /&gt; The flight of the Mirage was denied in the original French report of the incident, perhaps because it was engaged in [[industrial espionage]]. More recent reports have admitted the existence of the Mirage (and the fact that the Soviet crew were not told about the Mirage's flight) though not its role in the crash. However, the official press release did state: "though the inquiry established that there was no real risk of collision between the two aircraft, the Soviet pilot was likely to have been surprised."&lt;ref name="nova"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2503supersonic.html "Supersonic Spies."] ''Nova'' PBS air date: 27 January 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Moon also stresses that last-minute changes to the flight schedule would have disoriented the pilots in a cockpit with notably poor vision. He also cites an eyewitness who claims the co-pilot had agreed to take a camera with him, which he may have been operating at the time of the evasive manoeuvre.&lt;ref name="nova" /&gt; The initial approach may have been an attempted landing on the wrong runway, which occurred due to a last-minute shortening of the Tu-144's display.&lt;ref name="timeeurope" /&gt;

[[Bob Hoover]] believed that the rivalry of the Tu-144 and Concorde led the pilot of the Tu-144 to attempt a manoeuvre that went beyond the abilities of the aircraft: "That day, the Concorde went first, and after the pilot performed a high-speed flyby, he pulled up steeply and climbed to approximately 10,000 [feet] before leveling off. When the Tu-144 pilot performed the same manoeuvre he pulled the nose up so steeply l didn't believe he could possibly recover."&lt;ref name="timeeurope" /&gt;

Another theory claims that there was deliberate misinformation on the part of the Anglo-French design-team. The main thrust of this theory was that the Anglo-French team knew that the Soviet team was planning to steal the design plans of the Concorde, and the Soviets were allegedly passed false blueprints with a flawed design. The case, it is claimed, contributed to the imprisonment by the Soviets of [[Greville Wynne]] in 1963 for spying.&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, Greville. ''The Man from Odessa''. Dublin: Warnock Books, 1983. {{ISBN|0-586-05709-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Wright, Peter and Paul Greengrass.''Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer.'' London: Viking, 1987. {{ISBN|0-670-82055-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=There is no mention of Concorde in the book|date=February 2018}} Wynne was imprisoned on 11 May 1963 and the development of the Tu-144 was not sanctioned until 16 July.

The '''2010 Chile blackout''' was an electric [[power outage]] that affected most of [[Chile]] on March 14, 2010. It began at 8:44&amp;nbsp;pm (23:44 GMT) on Sunday and continued into the next day. The power was restored in a few hours in some areas, and by midnight in most areas, except in the [[Biobío Region]].&lt;ref name="sic"&gt;[https://www.cdec-sic.cl/noticia_en.php?noticia_id=852 [[Sistema Interconectado Central|CDEC-SIC]] Communicado]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Retrieved 17 March 2010. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blackout was caused by a failure of a 500 kV [[transformer]] at a [[Electrical substation|substation]] in southern Chile that is part of the [[Sistema Interconectado Central|Central Interconnected System]] (SIC). The affected transformer is located around {{convert|700|km}} south of the capital, [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8567910.stm|title= Chile plunged into darkness by power cut|date=15 March 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SIC serves about 93% of the country's population, from [[Taltal]] in the north to the [[Chiloé Island]] in the south, including Santiago.&lt;ref name="sic"/&gt; At one point Santiago was receiving only 8% of the electricity normally required.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jgD1HWniMw6lzC8tOJyT_YnZc-vgD9EEQQN80|title=Blackout leaves millions of Chileans in darkness|last=Vergara|first=Eva|date=15 March 2010|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blackout interrupted a music concert being held to raise funds for the survivors of the [[2010 Chile earthquake|earthquake that had devastated the country two weeks earlier]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; In addition, thousands of people had to be rescued from the [[Santiago Metro]] after 20 trains were immobilised and the telephone network was also affected.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jMgcf52UGrMhDzPJXbXJqp1QLvrw|title=Chile hit by massive blackout: emergency office|date=15 March 2010|publisher=Agence France Presse|accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire brigade had to free several people trapped in [[elevator]]s.&lt;ref name="Earth"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/314197,chile-expects-six-months-of-power-fragility-after-massive-quake.html|title= Chile expects six months of power 'fragility' after massive quake|date=15 March 2010|publisher=Earth News|accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blackout affected 90% of the population and electric service began to be restored after an hour.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Around 98% of people affected had service restored by March 15, 2010.&lt;ref name="xinhua"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-03/16/c_13211990.htm|title= Chile's power supply normalized gradually after blackout|date=16 March 2010|publisher=Xinhua|accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The blackout caused the share price of the [[Enersis]] mining group to fall by 1% to a three-month low, although loss of production was minimal there and at other mining companies in the country because of backup generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-15/enersis-falls-leading-chile-index-drop-on-blackout-concern.html|title=Enersis Falls to Three-Month Low on Blackout Concern (Update1)|last=Attwood|first=James|date=15 March 2010|publisher=Business Week|accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-15/chile-will-face-outages-for-a-week-on-quake-damage-pinera-says.html|title=Chile Will Face Outages for a Week on Quake Damage, Pinera Says|last1=Craze|first1=Matt|last2=Orihuela|first2=Rodrigo|date=15 March 2010|publisher=Business Week|accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[President of Chile|President]] [[Sebastián Piñera]] blamed the power failure on the recent earthquake and said the SIC would remain unstable for a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Chile's Pinera: Power Grid To Be Unstable For A Week After Blackout |url=http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/stock-market-news-story.aspx?storyid=201003151120dowjonesdjonline000218&amp;title=chiles-pinera-power-grid-to-be-unstable-for-a-week-after-blackout |agency=Dow Jones Newswires |date=15 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5oJ2FdOmZ?url=http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/stock-market-news-story.aspx?storyid=201003151120dowjonesdjonline000218&amp;title=chiles-pinera-power-grid-to-be-unstable-for-a-week-after-blackout |archivedate=2010-03-17 |accessdate=17 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other officials stated that the outage was not directly related to the earthquake.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The energy minister, [[Ricardo Raineri]], said that the electric transmission grid remains in a fragile state and asked Chileans to restrict their use of electricity.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Raineri stated that during the earthquake the "electricity network suffered various damages, be it in transformers, switches and others".&lt;ref name="Earth"/&gt;

An investigation was started to determine if the failure was due to a lack of maintenance of the transformer.&lt;ref name="xinhua"/&gt; Piñera vowed to get the transformer repaired within 48 hours of the blackout and to get affected transmission lines checked and repaired within seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1519628320100315?type=marketsNews|title=UPDATE 1-Chile's power grid unstable for a week – president|date=15 March 2010|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blackout investigation==

On August 2, 2010, the Chile regulatory authority Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels (SEC) determined that while the blackout was initiated by the equipment failure, the root cause was a widespread lack of coordination between the various companies in the day-to-day operations of the electricity sector. As a result, the SEC laid charges against all 115 companies involved in the electrical sector.

The charges were as follows:

*Each company did not coordinate its day-to-day operations to account for possible events, such as unforeseen transmission line failures.
*Each company did not coordinate any necessary actions with others in the electrical system to ensure the safety of the overall electrical system.
*Each company did not ensure the safe and efficient operation of the electrical system according to the established general criteria.
*Each company did not have established procedures in place for coordinated operation with other companies when needed to ensure system security or when required to maintain quality of service.

Additional charges were filed against [[Endesa (Chile)]], Transquillota, CHILECTRA, and TRANSELEC for either equipment failures in owned facilities or for failure to provide adequate information to Chile's central electrical grid system operator, Center for Economic Load Dispatch (CDEC-SIC). Further charges were also laid for issues at the Alto Jahuel high voltage electrical substation, located south of Santiago, which led to undue delays in recovery of the Metropolitan Region.

The Superintendent of the SEC, Patricia Chotzen, said that "after the technical analysis of the background, as part of a complex investigation, we decided to press charges against the companies involved whom have not made the necessary arrangements, referred to in our regulations."

Asked about whether the blackout may have been caused by the earthquake which had occurred two weeks previous, Chotzen said that "after an event of the magnitude of the earthquake of February, the companies had a duty to increase their level of coordination to avoid a collapse like this one. It is the duty of the utilities that provide a service as fundamental as electricity to ensure continuous and safe supply." The current legislation provided for fines of up to 10 000 AWU.&lt;ref name="SEC formula cargos en contra de 115 empresas eléctricas, 2010-08-02"&gt;{{cite news |title=SEC formula cargos en contra de 115 empresas eléctricas|url=http://www.sec.cl/pls/portal/SITIO_WEB.BLACKOUT.show|date=2 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''496 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Albus and Tricostus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 258 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 496 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''''April 9th''''' ({{lang-da|'''9. april'''}}) is a 2015 [[Denmark|Danish]] war film directed by Roni Ezra and starring [[Pilou Asbæk]] and [[Lars Mikkelsen]]. The film depicts the [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|German invasion of Denmark]] which commenced on 9 April 1940 and follows a group of Danish [[bicycle infantry]] sent as a vanguard to slow down the German advance until reinforcements can arrive.

The film's budget was 22 million [[Danish krone]] (just over $3 million) and was supported by the [[Danish Film Institute]], [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] and the [[Haderslev Municipality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LINDEGAARD|first1=SIGNE HAAHR|title=For Gud, konge og fædreland|url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/premium/kultur/article6828213.ece|website=Jyllands Posten|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in Danish cinemas on 12 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PEDERSEN|first1=KIM|title=Biografklub Danmark-programmet 2014-15|url=http://danske-biografer.dk/biografklub-danmark-programmet-2014-15/|website=Danske-biografer.dk|accessdate=27 February 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
During the night of 9 April 1940, the Danish army is alerted that the German army has crossed the border and Denmark is now at war with Europe's strongest army. In [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)#Fighting in Jutland|South Jutland]], a Danish bicycle infantry company and a motorcycle platoon is ordered to hold off the German advance until reinforcements can arrive but are quickly overwhelmed by superior German forces. During the morning [[Second Lieutenant]] Sand ([[Pilou Asbæk]]) and his platoon of soldiers battle the Germans and then retreat to [[Haderslev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=9.

==Production==
The film was directed by Roni Ezra and the screenplay was by Tobias Lindholm (who also wrote ''[[A Hijacking]]'', ''[[Borgen (TV series)|Borgen]]'' and ''[[The Hunt (2012 film)|The Hunt]]''). The outline story was based on eyewitness accounts, conversations and interviews with the few surviving veterans of 9 April 1940, who fought the invading German Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LINDEGAARD|first1=SIGNE HAAHR|title=For Gud, konge og fædreland|url=http://www.jyllands-posten.dk/premium/kultur/ECE6828213/for-gud-konge-og-faedreland/|website=Jyllands Posten|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Between Schleswig Limits" museum in Bylderup-Bov was approached by [[Nordisk Film]] in the autumn of 2013 with regards to assisting with uniforms and weapons. In March 2014 the film company collected 120 [[Danish M1923 helmet|Danish steel helmets]], 100 gas-mask canisters, 50 pairs of wool pants, 24 dummy-rifles, 32 cartridge belts, and a khaki officer coat. Moreover, the museum loaned two old [[Nimbus (motorcycle)|Nimbus motorcycles]] with side-cars. All equipment was initially transported to Budapest in Hungary, where part of the movie was shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museet "Mellem Slesvigs Grænser" hjælper Nordisk Film|url=http://www.museum-rens.dk/186444928|website=Mellem Slesvigs Grænser|accessdate=27 February 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was also shot in Haderslev, where the streets around Møllepladsen, Sønderbro and Convent Cemetery was sealed off from 17 to 19 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conradsen|first1=Emilie|title=FILMOPTAGELSER BEGYNDER I HADERSLEV|url=http://www.tvsyd.dk/artikel/245228:Filmoptagelser-begynder-i-Haderslev|website=TV2 Syd|accessdate=27 February 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other shootings took place at the Jacob Michelsen's Farm in Aabenraa and in Søgårdlejren.

==Reception==
The film received mixed, but generally favorable reviews from Danish critics, with [[Berlingske]] and Ekko giving it 5 out of 6 stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindberg|first1=Kristian|title=In 9.

'''Asystole''' (1860, from Modern Latin, from Greek [[privative a]] "not, without" + ''systolē'' "contraction")&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|asystole}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|sustolh/|συστολή|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the absence of ventricular contractions (note: this is in the context of a lethal [[heart arrhythmia]], not an induced asystole on a cooled patient on a [[heart-lung machine]] and [[general anesthesia]], during surgery necessitating stopping the heart). Asystole is the most serious form of [[cardiac arrest]] and is usually irreversible. A '''cardiac flatline''' is the state of total cessation of electrical activity from the [[heart]], which means no tissue contraction from the heart muscle and therefore no blood flow to the rest of the body.

Asystole should not be confused with very brief pauses in the heart's electrical activity—even those that produce a temporary flatline—that can occur in certain less severe abnormal rhythms. Asystole is different from very fine occurrences of [[ventricular fibrillation]], though both have a poor prognosis, and untreated fine VF will lead to asystole. Faulty wiring, disconnection of electrodes and leads, and power disruptions should be ruled out.   

Asystolic patients (as opposed to those with a "shockable rhythm" such as ventricular fibrillation or [[ventricular tachycardia]], which can potentially be treated with [[defibrillation]]) usually present with a very poor prognosis. Asystole is found initially in only about 28% of cardiac arrest cases,&lt;ref name=Bal2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldzizhar|first1=A|last2=Manuylova|first2=E|last3=Marchenko|first3=R|last4=Kryvalap|first4=Y|last5=Carey|first5=MG|title=Ventricular Tachycardias: Characteristics and Management.|journal=Critical care nursing clinics of North America|date=September 2016|volume=28|issue=3|pages=317–29|pmid=27484660|doi=10.1016/j.cnc.2016.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only 15% of these patients survive, even with the benefit of an [[intensive care unit]], with the rate being lower (6%) for those already prescribed drugs for [[vasopressor|high blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kutsogiannis|first1=DJ|title=Survival after in-ICU PEA/asystole cardiac arrest unchanged at 20 yrs|journal=CMAJ|date=4 October 2011|url=http://pulmccm.org/main/2011/review-articles/survival-after-in-icu-cardiac-arrest-poor/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asystole is treated by [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) combined with an intravenous [[vasopressor]] such as [[epinephrine]] (a.k.a. adrenaline). Sometimes an underlying reversible cause can be detected and treated (the so-called "[[Hs and Ts]]", an example of which is [[hypokalaemia]]). Several interventions previously recommended—such as defibrillation (known to be ineffective on asystole, but previously performed in case the rhythm was actually very fine ventricular fibrillation) and intravenous [[atropine]]—are no longer part of the routine protocols recommended by most major international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;AHA Cardiac Recussitation Guidelines, 2010: http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/122/18_suppl_3/S729&lt;/ref&gt;  Asystole may be treated with 1&amp;nbsp;mg epinephrine by IV every 3–5 minutes as needed. 

Survival rates in a cardiac arrest patient with asystole are much lower than a patient with a rhythm amenable to defibrillation; asystole is itself not a "shockable" rhythm. Out-of-hospital survival rates (even with emergency intervention) are less than 2 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.lww.com/surveyanesthesiology/Citation/2008/10000/Medical_Futility_in_Asystolic_Out_of_Hospital.44.aspx|title=Medical Futility in Asystolic Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest|author=|date=1 October 2008|publisher=|journal=Survey of Anesthesiology|volume=52|issue=5|pages=261|accessdate=7 April 2018|via=journals.lww.com|doi=10.1097/01.SA.0000318635.97636.a6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the heart is asystolic, there is no blood flow to the brain unless [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] or [[internal cardiac massage]] (when the chest is opened and the heart is manually compressed) is performed, and even then it is a small amount. After many emergency treatments have been applied but the heart is still unresponsive, it is time to consider pronouncing the patient [[dead]]. Even in the rare case that a rhythm reappears, if asystole has persisted for fifteen minutes or more, the brain will have been deprived of oxygen long enough to cause [[brain death]].

'''Campeonato Sudamericano de GT'''  (''Southamerican GT Championship'') previously known as '''GT3 Brasil Championship''', '''GT Brasil''' and '''Campeonato Brasileiro de GT'''  was a [[sports car racing]] series based in the [[Brazil]] organized by the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation|SRO Latin America]].

==History==
Starting in 2007, the GT3 Brasil Championship has been held in Brazil, also organized by SRO, with several veteran drivers racing in some events, such as former [[Formula One]] champions [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] and former [[Stock Car Brasil|Brazilian Stock Car]] champions [[Chico Serra]] and [[Ingo Hoffmann]]. Differently from the European series, GT3 Brasil accepts professional drivers, in a system where drivers are graded from A (International Driver) to D (Fully Amateur).

In [[2010 GT Brasil season|2010]] the championship was renamed for GT Brasil and announced the creation of GT4 class. For 2012 season was introduce GT Premium class caters for older, such as the [[Dodge Viper|Dodge Viper Competition Coupe]] or [[Porsche 911 GT3#997 GT3|Porsche 997 GT3 Cup S]]. The category losing the primary sponsor and change their name to Campeonato Brasileiro de GT. In 2013 the series became a South American championship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6802">[[File:Redheffer machine.JPG|thumb|A diagram of Redheffer's first machine]]
'''Charles Redheffer''' was an American [[inventor]] who claimed to have invented a [[perpetual motion]] machine. First appearing in [[Philadelphia]], Redheffer exhibited his machine to the public, charging high prices for viewing. When he applied to the government for more money, a group of inspectors were sent to examine the machine. It was discovered the machine was actually powered by a device Redheffer claimed was powered by the machine.

Redheffer moved to New York City and set up a similar [[scam]] after rebuilding his machine. However, an engineer detected that it was a fake by listening to its unsteady motions at an exhibition. He discovered that the machine was operated by a man using a crank in a room on the floor above. Redheffer returned to Philadelphia. He later claimed to have created another machine, but refused to demonstrate it to anyone. He managed to get a patent for his machine in 1820, but after this his fate is unknown.

==Personal life==
Little has been recorded about Redheffer's life, other than his connection to the hoax. According to one source, he was from [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]] in [[Philadelphia]],&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; but most sources simply state that he appeared in Philadelphia with his machine. Redheffer disappeared from public view after the discovery of the fraud, and his fate is unknown.

==Appearance in Philadelphia==
Charles Redheffer and his machine became well known in Philadelphia in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, p.125&lt;/ref&gt; Redheffer claimed he had invented a [[perpetual motion]] machine and exhibited it in a house near the [[Schuylkill River]] in the outskirts of the city.&lt;ref name=ordhume126&gt;Ord-Hume, p.126&lt;/ref&gt; He charged an admission fee of $5 (some sources claim $1) for men to view it; depending on the source, women were admitted free or at a charge of $1.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, p.130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Puzzle of Perpetual Motion |date=26 July 1954 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machine caused a sensation, and Redheffer lobbied for funds to build a larger version.&lt;ref name=ordhume126 /&gt;

On January 21, 1813, eight city commissioners visited Redheffer to inspect the machine. They had to do so through a barred window,&lt;ref name=ordhume126 /&gt; as Redheffer was concerned anyone going near the machine might damage it.&lt;ref name=moh&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Hoaxipedia/Perpetual_Motion_Machine_of_Charles_Redheffer/ |title=Perpetual Motion Machine of Charles Redheffer |publisher=[[Museum of Hoaxes]] |accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the inspectors, Nathan Sellers, was accompanied by his son Coleman, who noticed something odd about the [[gear]]s. The machine itself was said to be powering a separate device through a series of gears and weights. Coleman noticed that the cogs were worn on the wrong side and suggested that the device was in fact powering the machine.&lt;ref name=ah&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1961/3/1961_3_78.shtml |title=Why won’t they work? |first=Clifford B. |last=Hicks |date=April 1961 |work=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage Magazine]] |publisher=American Heritage Publishing Company |accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elder Sellers was convinced the machine was a hoax. To validate his suspicions, he hired local engineer Isaiah Lukens to build a similar machine, using a hidden [[clockwork]] motor as a power source.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; They then arranged a demonstration of the machine to Redheffer, who was immediately convinced and offered to buy it.&lt;ref name=ah /&gt; Meanwhile, Redheffer's machine appeared in the ''[[Philadelphia Gazette]]''. Civil engineer Charles Gobort offered to bet sums of money ranging from $6,000 to $10,000 that the machine was genuine, and that Redheffer had discovered perpetual motion.&lt;ref name=ah /&gt;

==Move to New York City==
[[File:Fulton.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Fulton, who discovered that the machine exhibited in New York City was a fraud]]
His ruse revealed, Redheffer immediately departed for New York City where he was still unknown.&lt;ref name=moh /&gt; He changed his machine somewhat so that it could not be detected as easily, and he exhibited it as he had done in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, p.132&lt;/ref&gt;

When mechanical engineer [[Robert Fulton]] went to see the machine, he noticed that the machine was unsteady as if someone were driving it manually and irregularly with a crank.&lt;ref name=moh /&gt; Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced the machine was a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would pay for all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a [[catgut]] cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.&lt;ref name=ah /&gt;

==Later appearances==
Redheffer appears to have constructed another machine in 1816, which he stated his intention to demonstrate to a group of men including the mayor and chief justice of Philadelphia. However, despite several meetings, Redheffer refused to demonstrate the machine to them.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden-Niles, p.26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 1820, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] granted a [[patent]] to Charles Redheffer (or Charles Redheiffer) for a device listed as "machinery for the purpose of gaining power".&lt;ref&gt;Force, p.145&lt;/ref&gt; (Unfortunately, all patents up to 1836 were lost in the [[1836 U.S. Patent Office fire]]. If recovered, it would be [[X-Patent]] X3,215.)

The city of '''Athens''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀθῆναι}}, ''Athênai'' [[Help:IPA/Greek|[a.tʰɛ̂ː.nai̯]]]; [[Modern Greek]]: Ἀθῆναι, ''Athínai'' {{IPA-el|aˈθiɲe|}}) during the [[Classical Greece|classical period]] of [[Ancient Greece]] (508–322 BC)&lt;ref&gt;''Democracy and knowledge: innovation and learning in classical Athens'' by Josiah Ober [https://books.google.com/books?id=nQVeaO4vJZoC&amp;pg=PA40 p. 40] {{ISBN|0-691-13347-6}} (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; was the major urban center of the notable [[polis]] ([[city-state]]) of the same name, located in [[Attica]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], leading the [[Delian League]] in the [[Peloponnesian War]] against [[Sparta]] and the [[Peloponnesian League]]. [[Athenian democracy]] was established in 508 BC under [[Cleisthenes]] following the [[Athenian tyranny|tyranny]] of [[Isagoras]]. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of [[Lamian War]]). The peak of Athenian [[hegemony]] was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the [[Age of Pericles]].

In the [[Classical Greece|classical period]], [[Athens]] was a center for the arts, learning and [[philosophy]], home of [[Plato]]'s [[Platonic Academy|Akademia]] and [[Aristotle]]'s [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=www.culture.gr |title=Plato's Academy |work= Hellenic Ministry of Culture |url=http://www.culture.gr/2/21/211/21103a/e211ca03.html |accessdate=2007-03-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070321014534/http://www.culture.gr/2/21/211/21103a/e211ca03.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greece uncovers 'holy grail' of Greek archeology |author=CNN &amp; Associated Press |publisher=CNN.com |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9701/16/greece.lyceum/index.html |date=1997-01-16 |accessdate=2007-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404061645/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9701/16/greece.lyceum/index.html |archivedate=April 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Athens was also the birthplace of [[Socrates]], Plato, [[Pericles]], [[Aristophanes]], [[Sophocles]], and many other prominent philosophers, writers and politicians of the ancient world.

==History==
===Rise to power (508–448 BC)===

{{main|Ionian Revolt|Persian Wars|First Peloponnesian War}}
[[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]], son of Peisistratus,  had ruled Athens jointly with his brother, Hipparchus, from the death of Peisistratus c527. Following the assassination of Hipparchus c514, Hippias took on sole rule, and in response to the loss of his brother, became a worse leader and increasingly disliked. Hippias exiled 700 of the Athenian noble families, amongst them [[Cleisthenes]]' family, the Alchmaeonids. Upon their exile, they went to Delphi, and Herodotus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Histories|last=Translated Robin Waterfield|first=Herodotus|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; says they bribed the Pithia to always tell visiting Spartans that they should invade Attica and overthrow Hippias. This, supposedly, worked  after a number of times, and Cleomenes led a Spartan force to overthrow Hippias, which succeeded, and instated an oligarchy. Cleisthenes disliked the Spartan rule, along with many other Athenians, and so made his own bid for power. The result of this was [[democracy in Athens]], but considering Cleisthenes' motivation for using the people to gain power, as without their support, he would have been defeated, and so Athenian democracy may be tinted by the fact its creation served greatly the man who created it. The reforms of Cleisthenes replaced the traditional four Ionic "tribes" ([[phyle]]) with ten new ones, named after legendary heroes of Greece and having no class basis, which acted as electorates. Each tribe was in turn divided into three trittyes (one from the coast; one from the city and one from the inland divisions), while each [[trittys]] had one or more [[deme]]s (see [[deme]]) – depending on their population – which became the basis of local government. The tribes each selected fifty members by lot for the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]], the council which governed Athens on a day-to-day basis. The [[public opinion]] of voters could be influenced by the [[political satire]]s written by the [[comic poets]] and performed in the city [[Theater of ancient Greece|theaters]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. (1993) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp.307–19 in {{cite book |editor=Sommerstein, A.H |editor2=S. Halliwell |editor3=J. Henderson |editor4=B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Assembly]] or Ecclesia was open to all full citizens and was both a legislature and a supreme court, except in murder cases and religious matters, which became the only remaining functions of the Areopagus. Most offices were filled by lot, although the ten [[strategos|strategoi]] (generals) were elected.

[[File:EarlyAthenianCoin.jpg|thumb|Early [[Athenian]] coin, 5th century BC. [[British Museum]].]]

Prior to the rise of Athens, [[Sparta]], a city-state with a militaristic culture, considered itself the leader of the Greeks, and enforced a [[hegemony]]. 

The silver [[mines of Laurion]] contributed significantly to the development of Athens in the 5th century BC, when the Athenians learned to prospect, treat, and refine the ore and used the proceeds to build a massive fleet, at the instigation of [[Themistocles]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ancient-greece.org/archaeology/lavrion.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 499 BC Athens sent troops to aid the [[Ionia]]n Greeks of [[Asia Minor]], who were rebelling against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] (see [[Ionian Revolt]]). This provoked two Persian invasions of Greece, both of which were repelled under the leadership of the soldier-statesmen [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]] and [[Themistocles]] (see [[Persian Wars]]). In 490 the Athenians, led by [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]], prevented the first invasion of the Persians, guided by king [[Darius I]], at the [[Battle of Marathon]]. In 480 the Persians returned under a new ruler, [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes I]]. The Hellenic League led by the Spartan King [[Leonidas]] led 7,000 men to hold the narrow passageway of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] against the 100,000–250,000 army of Xerxes, during which time Leonidas and 300 other Spartan elites were killed. Simultaneously the Athenians led an indecisive naval battle off [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]]. However, this delaying action was not enough to discourage the Persian advance which soon marched through [[Boeotia]], setting up [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] as their base of operations, and entered southern Greece. This forced the Athenians to evacuate Athens, which was taken by the Persians, and seek the protection of their fleet. Subsequently, the Athenians and their allies, led by [[Themistocles]], defeated the Persian navy at sea in the [[Battle of Salamis]]. Xerxes had built himself a throne on the coast in order to see the Greeks defeated. Instead, the Persians were routed. Sparta's hegemony was passing to Athens, and it was Athens that took the war to Asia Minor. These victories enabled it to bring most of the Aegean and many other parts of Greece together in the [[Delian League]], an Athenian-dominated alliance.

===Athenian hegemony (448–430 BC)===

{{main|Age of Pericles}}
[[Pericles]] – an Athenian general, politician and orator – distinguished himself above the other personalities of the era, men who excelled in [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[history]] and [[literature]]. He fostered arts and literature and gave to Athens a splendor which would never return throughout its history. He executed a large number of public works projects and improved the life of the citizens. Hence, he gave his name to the '''Athenian Golden Age'''. Silver mined in [[Laurium]] in southeastern Attica contributed greatly to the prosperity of this "Golden" Age of Athens.

During the time of the ascendancy of [[Ephialtes]] as leader of the democratic faction, [[Pericles]] was his deputy. When Ephialtes was [[assassination|assassinated]] by personal enemies, Pericles stepped in and was elected general, or ''[[strategos]]'', in 445 BC; a post he held continuously until his death in 429 BC, always by election of the [[Athenian Assembly]]. The [[Parthenon]], a lavishly decorated temple to the goddess [[Athena]], was constructed under the administration of Pericles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Athens|last=Camp|first=John|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment by other cities at the hegemony of Athens led to the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431, which pitted Athens and her increasingly rebellious sea empire against a coalition of land-based states led by [[Sparta]]. The conflict marked the end of Athenian [[command of the sea]]. The war between Athens and the city-state Sparta ended with an Athenian defeat after Sparta started its own navy.

Athenian democracy was briefly overthrown by the [[Athenian coup of 411 BC|coup of 411]], brought about because of its poor handling of the war, but it was quickly restored. The war ended with the complete defeat of Athens in 404. Since the defeat was largely blamed on democratic politicians such as [[Cleon]] and [[Cleophon (politician)|Cleophon]], there was a brief reaction against democracy, aided by the Spartan army (the rule of the [[Thirty Tyrants]]). In 403, [[Phyle Campaign|democracy was restored]] by [[Thrasybulus]] and an amnesty declared.

===Corinthian War and the Second Athenian League (395–355 BC)===

Sparta's former allies soon turned against her due to her imperialist policies, and Athens's former enemies, [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], became her allies. [[Argos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], allied with [[Athens]], fought against [[Sparta]] in the decisive [[Corinthian War]] of 395–387 BC. Opposition to Sparta enabled Athens to establish a [[Second Athenian League]]. Finally [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] defeated Sparta in 371 in the [[Battle of Leuctra]]. However, other Greek cities, including Athens, turned against [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and its dominance was brought to an end at the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)]] with the death of its leader, the military genius [[Epaminondas]].

===Philip II, League of Corinth and the Lamian war (355–322 BC), Hellenistic period, Athens under Rome (322–86 BC)===

{{further|Alexander the Great|Antipatrid dynasty|Antigonid dynasty}}

By mid century, however, the northern Greek kingdom of [[Macedon]] was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338 BC the armies of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] defeated Athens at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]], effectively  limiting Athenian independence. During the winter of 338 BC /337 BC Macedonia, Athens and other Greek states became part of the [[League of Corinth]]. Further, the conquests of his son, [[Alexander the Great]], widened Greek horizons and made the traditional Greek city state obsolete. [[Antipater]] dissolved the Athenian government and established a [[plutocracy|plutocratic]] system in 322 BC (see [[Lamian War]] and [[Demetrius Phalereus]]). 

In the 2nd century BC, following the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)]], Greece was absorbed into the [[Roman Republic]] as part of the [[Achaea Province]]. Athens remained a wealthy city with a brilliant cultural life, but after the [[Siege of Athens and Piraeus (87–86 BC)]] by [[Sulla]] ceased to be an independent power.

==The City of Athens==

===Overview===
[[File:Map ancient athens.png|thumb|250px|Map of ancient Athens showing the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] in middle, the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]] to the northwest, and the city walls.]]
Athens was in [[Attica]], about 30 [[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]] from the sea, on the southwest slope of [[Mount Lycabettus]], between the small rivers [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Cephissus]] to the west, [[Ilissos]] to the south, and the [[Eridanos (Athens)|Eridanos]] to the north, the latter of which flowed through the town. The walled city measured about {{convert|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, although at its peak the city had suburbs extending well beyond these walls. The [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] was just south of the centre of this walled area. The city was burnt by [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] in 480 BC, but was soon rebuilt under the administration of [[Themistocles]], and was adorned with public buildings by [[Cimon]] and especially by [[Pericles]], in whose time (461–429 BC) it reached its greatest splendour. Its beauty was chiefly due to its public buildings, for the private houses were mostly insignificant, and its streets badly laid out. Towards the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]], it contained more than 10,000 houses,&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Mem.'' iii. 6.14&lt;/ref&gt; which at a rate of 12 inhabitants to a house would give a population of 120,000, though some writers make the inhabitants as many as 180,000. Athens consisted of two distinct parts:
* ''The City'', properly so called, divided into The Upper City or [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], and The Lower City, surrounded with walls by Themistocles.
* The port city of [[Piraeus]], also surrounded with walls by Themistocles and connected to the city with the [[Long Walls]], built under [[Conon]] and [[Pericles]].

===The City Walls===
{{main|City walls of Athens}}
{{main|Long Walls}}
[[File:AtheneOudheid.JPG|thumb|250px|Map of the environs of Athens showing [[Piraeus]], [[Phalerum]], and the [[Long Walls]]]]
The city was surrounded by defensive walls from the Bronze Age and they were rebuilt and extended over the centuries.

In addition the [[Long Walls]] consisted of two parallel walls leading to [[Piraeus]], 40 [[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]] long (4.5 miles, 7&amp;nbsp;km), running parallel to each other, with a narrow passage between them and, furthermore, a wall to [[Phalerum]] on the east, 35 stadia long (4 miles, 6.5&amp;nbsp;km). There were therefore three long walls in all; but the name ''Long Walls'' seems to have been confined to the two leading to the Piraeus, while the one leading to Phalerum was called the ''Phalerian Wall''. The entire circuit of the walls was 174.5 stadia (nearly 22 miles, 35&amp;nbsp;km), of which 43 stadia (5.5 miles, 9&amp;nbsp;km) belonged to the city, 75 stadia (9.5 miles, 15&amp;nbsp;km) to the long walls, and 56.5 stadia (7 miles, 11&amp;nbsp;km) to Piraeus, Munichia, and Phalerum.

===The Acropolis (upper city)===
The [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], also called ''Cecropia'' from its reputed founder, [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], was a steep rock in the middle of the city, about 50 meters high, 350 meters long, and 150 meters wide; its sides were naturally scarped on all sides except the west end. It was originally surrounded by an ancient [[Cyclopean masonry|Cyclopean]] wall said to have been built by the [[Pelasgians]]. At the time of the [[Peloponnesian war]] only the north part of this wall remained, and this portion was still called the ''Pelasgic Wall''; while the south part which had been rebuilt by [[Cimon]], was called the ''Cimonian Wall''. On the west end of the Acropolis, where access is alone practicable, were the magnificent ''[[Propylaea]]'', "the Entrances," built by [[Pericles]], before the right wing of which was the small [[Temple of Athena Nike]]. The summit of the Acropolis was covered with temples, statues of bronze and marble, and various other works of art. Of the temples, the grandest was the ''[[Parthenon]]'', sacred to the "Virgin" goddess [[Athena]]; and north of the Parthenon was the magnificent ''[[Erechtheion]]'', containing three separate temples, one to ''Athena Polias'', or the "Protectress of the State," the ''Erechtheion'' proper, or sanctuary of [[Erechtheus]], and the ''[[Pandroseion]]'', or sanctuary of [[Pandrosos]], the daughter of Cecrops. Between the Parthenon and Erechtheion was the colossal [[Athena Promachos|Statue of Athena Promachos]], or the "Fighter in the Front," whose helmet and spear was the first object on the Acropolis visible from the sea.

[[File:Akropolis by Leo von Klenze.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] imagined in an 1846 painting by [[Leo von Klenze]]]]

===The Agora (lower city)===
The lower city was built in the plain around the Acropolis, but this plain also contained several hills, especially in the southwest part. On the west side the walls embraced the Hill of the Nymphs and the [[Pnyx]], and to the southeast they ran along beside the [[Ilissos]].

===Gates===
There were many gates, among the more important there were:
* On the West side: ''Dipylon'', the most frequented gate of the city, leading from the inner [[Kerameikos]] to the outer Kerameikos, and to the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]]. ''The Sacred Gate'', where the sacred road to [[Eleusis]] began. ''The Knight's Gate'', probably between the Hill of the Nymphs and the [[Pnyx]]. ''The Piraean Gate'', between the Pnyx and the Mouseion, leading to the carriage road between the Long Walls to the Piraeus. ''The Melitian Gate'', so called because it led to the [[deme]] Melite, within the city.
* On the South side: ''The Gate of the Dead'' in the neighbourhood of the Mouseion. ''The Itonian Gate'', near the Ilissos, where the road to [[Phalerum]] began.
* On the East side: ''The Gate of Diochares'', leading to the [[Lyceum]]. ''The Diomean Gate'', leading to [[Cynosarges]] and the deme Diomea.
* On the North side: ''The Acharnian Gate'', leading to the deme [[Acharnai]].

===Districts===
* The ''Inner [[Kerameikos]]'', or "Potter's Quarter," in the west of the city, extending north as far as the Dipylon gate, by which it was separated from the outer Kerameikos; the Kerameikos contained the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]], or "market-place," the only one in the city, lying northwest of the Acropolis, and north of the [[Areopagus]].
* The [[deme]] [[Melite (Attica)|Melite]], in the west of the city, south of the inner Kerameikos.
* The deme [[Skambonidai]], in the northern part of the city, east of the inner Kerameikos.
* The [[Kollytos]], in the southern part of the city, south and southwest of the Acropolis.
* [[Coele|Koele]], a district in the southwest of the city.
* ''Limnai'', a district east of Melite and Kollytos, between the Acropolis and the Ilissos.
* [[Diomea (Attica)|Diomea]], a district in the east of the city, near the gate of the same name and the [[Cynosarges]].
* ''Agrai'', a district south of Diomea.

===Hills===
* The ''[[Areopagus]]'', the "Hill of [[Ares]]," west of the Acropolis, which gave its name to the celebrated council that held its sittings there, was accessible on the south side by a flight of steps cut out of the rock.
* The ''Hill of the Nymphs'', northwest of the Areopagus.
* The ''[[Pnyx]]'', a semicircular hill, southwest of the Areopagus, where the ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ekklesia]]'' (assemblies) of the people were held in earlier times, for afterwards the people usually met in the [[Theatre of Dionysus]].
* The ''Mouseion'', "the Hill of the Muses," south of the Pnyx and the Areopagus.

===Streets===

Among the more important streets, there were:
* The ''Piraean Street'', which led from the Piraean gate to the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]].
* The ''Panathenaic Way'', which led from the Dipylon gate to the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] via the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]], along which a solemn procession was made during the [[Panathenaic Festival]].
* The ''Street of the Tripods'', on the east side of the Acropolis.

===Public buildings===
[[File:Hephaistos Temple.JPG|250px|thumb|The [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in modern-day [[Athens]]]]
* ''Temples''. Of these the most important was the ''Olympieion'', or [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]], southeast of the Acropolis, near the Ilissos and the fountain Callirrhoë, which was long unfinished, and was first completed by [[Hadrian]]. The [[Temple of Hephaestus]], located to the west of the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]]. The [[Temple of Ares]], to the north of the Agora. ''[[Metroon]]'', or temple of the mother of the gods, on the west side of the Agora. Besides these, there was a vast number of other temples in all parts of the city.
* The ''[[Bouleuterion]]'' (Senate House), at the west side of the Agora.
* The ''[[Prytaneion|Tholos]]'', a round building close to the Bouleuterion, built c. 470 BC by [[Cimon]], which served as the [[Prytaneion]], in which the [[Prytaneis]] took their meals and offered their sacrifices.
[[File:Plan Roman Agora at Athens.svg|thumb|Plan Roman Agora at Athens]]
* ''[[Stoa]]e'', or Colonnades, supported by pillars, and used as places of resort in the heat of the day, of which there were several in Athens. In the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]] there were: the ''[[Stoa Basileios]]'', the court of the [[Archon of Athens|King-Archon]], on the west side of the Agora; the ''[[Stoa of Zeus|Stoa Eleutherios]]'', or Colonnade of Zeus Eleutherios, on the west side of the Agora; the ''[[Stoa poikile|Stoa Poikile]]'', so called because it was adorned with fresco painting of the [[Battle of Marathon]] by [[Polygnotus]], on the north side of the Agora.
[[File:DionysiusTheater.jpg|thumb|250px|Artist's impression of the [[Theatre of Dionysus]]]]
* ''Theatres''. The [[Theatre of Dionysus]], on the southeast slope of the Acropolis, was the great theatre of the state. Besides this there were ''[[Odeon (building)|Odeons]]'', for contests in vocal and instrumental music, an ancient one near the fountain Callirrhoë, and a second built by [[Pericles]], close to the theatre of Dionysius, on the southeast slope of the Acropolis. The large odeon surviving today, the [[Odeon of Herodes Atticus]] was built in [[Roman times]].
* [[Panathenaic Stadium]], south of the Ilissos, in the district Agrai, where the athletic portion of the [[Panathenaic Games]] were held.
* The ''[[Argyrocopeum]]'' (mint) appears to have been in or adjoining the chapel (''[[heroon]]'') of a hero named Stephanephorus.

===Suburbs===
* The ''Outer [[Kerameikos]]'', northwest of the city, was the finest suburb of Athens; here were buried the Athenians who had fallen in war, and at the further end of it was the ''[[Platonic Academy|Academy]]'', 6 stadia from the city.
* ''[[Cynosarges]]'', east of the city, across the Ilissos, reached from the Diomea gate, a [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] sacred to [[Heracles]], where the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] [[Antisthenes]] taught.
* ''[[Lyceum]]'', east of the city, a gymnasium sacred to [[Apollo|Apollo Lyceus]], where [[Aristotle]] taught.

==Culture==
{{main|Age of Pericles|Ancient Greek philosophy|Athenian festivals|Greek theatre}}
[[File:Athènes Acropole Caryatides.JPG|thumb|250px|The Karyatides statues of the [[Erechtheion]] on its Acropolis.]]

The period from the end of the Persian Wars to the Macedonian conquest marked the zenith of Athens as a center of literature, philosophy (see [[Greek philosophy]]) and the arts (see [[Greek theatre]]). Some of the most important figures of Western cultural and intellectual history lived in Athens during this period: the dramatists [[Aeschylus]], [[Aristophanes]], [[Euripides]] and [[Sophocles]], the philosophers [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]], and [[Socrates]], the historians [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]] and [[Xenophon]], the poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]] and the sculptor [[Phidias]]. The leading statesman of this period was [[Pericles]], who used the tribute paid by the members of the Delian League to build the [[Parthenon]] and other great monuments of classical Athens. The city became, in Pericles's words, an education for Hellas (usually quoted as "the school of Hellas [Greece].")&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, 2.41.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Reserve System]] (also known as "the Fed") has faced various criticisms since it was authorized in 1913.&lt;ref name="boshistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bos.frb.org/about/pubs/begin.pdf |format=PDF |title=Historical Beginnings...

==Creation==
{{Main|History of the Federal Reserve System}}

An early version of the [[Federal Reserve Act]] was drafted in 1910 on [[Jekyll Island]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Nelson Aldrich]], chairman of the [[National Monetary Commission]], and several Wall Street bankers. The final version, with provisions intended to improve public oversight and weaken the influence of the New York banking establishment, was drafted by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Member of Congress|Congressman]] [[Carter Glass]] of [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Elmus |last=Wicker |title=The Great Debate On Banking Reform - Nelson Aldrich And The Origins Of The Fed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoisMZniCy4C&amp;pg=PA4 |year=2005 |publisher=Ohio State University Press |pages=4–6 |isbn=9780814210000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of the Fed was a compromise between the desire of the bankers for a central bank under their control and the desire of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] to create a decentralized structure under public control.&lt;ref name="boshistory"/&gt;  The Federal Reserve Act was approved by Congress and signed by President Wilson in December 1913.&lt;ref name="boshistory"/&gt;

==Inflation policy==
In ''[[The Case Against the Fed]]'', [[Murray Rothbard]] argued that, although a supposed core function of the Federal Reserve is to maintain a low level of [[inflation]], its policies (like those of other [[central bank]]s) have actually aggravated inflation. This occurs when the Fed creates too much [[fiat money]] backed by nothing. He called the Fed policy of [[money creation]] "legalized [[counterfeiting]]" and favored a return to the [[gold standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author =Murray Rothbard| | title =The Case Against the Fed| publisher =Ludwig Von Mises Institute| date =2007| pages =27–29, 146| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5rgJI0ya0JcC&amp;q=%22Legalized%20Counterfeiting%22 | isbn = 978-0945466178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: {{cquote| [I]t is undeniable that, ever since the Fed was visited upon us in 1914, our inflations have been more intense, and our depressions far deeper, than ever before.
There is only one way to eliminate chronic inflation, as well as the booms and busts brought by that system of inflationary credit: and that is to eliminate the counterfeiting that constitutes and creates that inflation. And the only way to do that is to abolish legalized counterfeiting: that is, to abolish the Federal Reserve System, and return to the gold standard, to a monetary system where a market-produced metal, such as gold, serves as the standard money, and not paper tickets printed by the Federal Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author =Murray Rothbard| title =The Case Against the Fed| publisher =Ludwig Von Mises Institute| date =2007| page=146| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5rgJI0ya0JcC&amp;q=%22Legalized%20Counterfeiting%22 | isbn = 978-0945466178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Congress==
Several members of Congress have criticized the Fed. Senator [[Robert Latham Owen|Robert Owen]], whose name was on the Glass-Owen [[Federal Reserve Act]], believed that the Fed was not performing as promised. He said: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Federal Reserve Board was created to control,  regulate and stabilize credit in the interest of all people. . . . The Federal Reserve Board is the most gigantic financial power in all the world. Instead of using this great power as the Federal Reserve Act intended that it should, the board . . . delegated this power to the banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eustace |last=Mullins |title=The Secrets of the Federal Reserve |year=2009 |publisher=Bridger House Publishers |url=http://www.apfn.org/apfn/reserve.htm |isbn=0-9656492-1-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1921/07/25/archives/owen-criticises-reserve-board-senator-says-powers-have-been.html "Owen criticises reserve board"], ''The New York Times'' (July 25, 1921)&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Representative [[Louis T. McFadden]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Committee on Banking and Currency]] from 1920 to 1931, accused the Federal Reserve of deliberately causing the Great Depression. In several speeches made shortly after he lost the chairmanship of the committee, McFadden claimed that the Federal Reserve was run by Wall Street banks and their affiliated European banking houses. In one 1932 House speech (that has been criticized as bluster&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Edward |last=Flaherty |title=Myth #10. The Legendary Tirade of Louis T. McFadden |date=6 Sep 2000 |url=http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/flaherty/flaherty10.html |website=Political Research Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;), he stated: {{quote|Mr. Chairman, we have in this country one of the most corrupt Institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks;  . . .  This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the United States . . . through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it.&lt;ref name= "Congressional Record, June 10, 1932"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-ed9k_Ns-KZhp3WOn/Congressional-Record-June-10-1932-Louis-T-McFadden_djvu.txt|first=Louis |last=McFadden |title=Congressional Record, June 10, 1932, Louis T. McFadden |date=June 10, 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many members of Congress who have been involved in the House and [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Senate Banking and Currency Committees]] have been open critics of the Federal Reserve, including Chairmen [[Wright Patman]],&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,870767-1,00.html |title=Banking: Fight over the Federal Reserve |accessdate=20 August 2010 | work=Time |date=14 February 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Reuss]],&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/24/business/moves-on-in-congress-to-lift-secrecy-at-the-federal-reserve.html |title=Moves On in Congress to Lift Secrecy at the Federal Reserve |author=Uchitelle, Louis |authorlink=Louis Uchitelle |accessdate=20 August 2010 |work=The New York Times |date=24 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henry B. Gonzalez]]. Representative [[Ron Paul]], Chairman of the Monetary Policy Subcommittee in 2011, is known as a staunch opponent of the Federal Reserve System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Paul|title=End the Fed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3vkxGyQ-BQC&amp;q=%22The%20Fed%20was%20the%20cause%20of%20the%20Depression%22|date=2009|publisher=Grand Central Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; He routinely introduced bills to abolish the Federal Reserve System,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., H.R. 2755 (110th Congress); H.R. 2778 (108th Congress); H.R. 5356 (107th Congress); H.R. 1148 (106th Congress)&lt;/ref&gt; three of which gained approval in the House but lost in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-2755 |title=H.R. 2755: Federal Reserve Board Abolition Act&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt; |website=GovTrack.us |date=15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman Paul also introduced H.R. 459: Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr459 |title=H.R. 459: Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2011 |website=GovTrack.us |date=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jennifer |last=Bendery |title=Nancy Pelosi: 'Audit The Fed' Bill Is Likely Going Nowhere |date=26 July 2012 |website=Huffington Post |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/26/nancy-pelosi-audit-the-fed_n_1706235.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act required an audit of the Federal Reserve Board and the twelve regional banks, with particular attention to the valuation of its securities. His son, Senator [[Rand Paul]], has introduced similar legislation in subsequent sessions of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignforliberty.org/senate-vote-audit-fed-scheduled-january-12th|title=Senate Vote on Audit the Fed Scheduled for January 12th |first=Megan |last=Stiles |work=Campaign for Liberty |date=December 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Depression (1929)==
[[File:Money_supply_during_the_great_depression_era.png|400px|thumb|right| Money supply decreased significantly between [[Black Tuesday]] and the [[Emergency Banking Act|Bank Holiday in March 1933]] when there were massive [[bank runs]] across the United States]]
{{Main|Causes of the Great Depression}}
[[Image:Crowd outside nyse.jpg|thumb|Crowd gathering on [[Wall Street]] after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 crash]].]]

[[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]] stated that the Fed pursued an erroneously restrictive monetary policy, exacerbating the [[Great Depression]].  After the [[stock market crash]] in 1929, the Fed continued its contraction (decrease) of the [[money supply]] and refused to save banks that were struggling with [[bank runs]]. 
This mistake, critics charge, allowed what might have been a relatively mild recession to explode into catastrophe. Friedman and Schwartz believed that the depression was "a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933 (New Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&amp;q=%22a%20tragic%20testimonial%20to%20the%20importance%20of%20monetary%20forces.%22|year=2008|pages=xviii, 13|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Before the establishment of the Federal Reserve, the banking system had dealt with periodic crises (such as in the [[Panic of 1907]]) by suspending the convertibility of deposits into currency. In 1907, the system nearly collapsed and there was an extraordinary intervention by an ad-hoc coalition assembled by [[J. P. Morgan]]. In the years 1910–1913, the bankers demanded a central bank to address this structural weakness. Friedman suggested that a similar intervention should have been followed during the banking [[Panic of 1930|panic at the end of 1930]]. This might have stopped the vicious circle of forced liquidation of assets at depressed prices, just as suspension of [[convertibility]] in 1893 and 1907 had quickly ended the [[market liquidity|liquidity]] crises at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933 (New Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&amp;q=%221893%20and%201907%22|year=2008|page=28|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Essentially, in the monetarist view, the Great Depression was caused by the fall of the money supply. Friedman and Schwartz note that "[f]rom the cyclical peak in August 1929 to a cyclical trough in March 1933, the stock of money fell by over a third."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933 (New Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&amp;q=%22in%20March%201933%20the%20stock%20of%20money%20fell%20by%20over%20a%20third%22|year=2008|page=11|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was what Friedman calls "The [[Great Contraction]]"—a period of falling income, prices, and employment caused by the choking effects of a restricted [[money supply]]. The mechanism suggested by Friedman and Schwartz was that people wanted to hold more money than the Federal Reserve was supplying. People thus hoarded money by consuming less. This, in turn, caused a contraction in employment and production, since prices were not flexible enough to immediately fall. Friedman and Schwartz argued the Federal Reserve allowed the money supply to plummet because of ineptitude and poor leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Chang-Tai Hsie|author2=Christina D. Romer|date=2006|title=Was the Federal Reserve Constrained by the Gold Standard During the Great Depression?|url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/chang-tai.hsieh/research/jeh%201932%20omo.pdf|publisher=Journal of Economic History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have since agreed with this theory, including [[Ben Bernanke]], [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]] from 2006 until 2014, who, in a speech honoring Friedman and Schwartz, said:
{{quote|Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben S. |last=Bernanke |title=Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke |website=FederalReserve.gov |date=8 Nov 2002 |accessdate=1 Jan 2007 |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021108/default.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933 (New Edition)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&amp;q=%22Regarding%20the%20Great%20Depression%20You're%20right%20We%20did%20it%22|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Friedman has said that ideally he would prefer to "abolish the Federal Reserve and replace it with a computer."&lt;ref name="friedman"&gt;{{cite web |first=Kathleen |last=O'Toole |title= Greenspan voices concerns about quality of economic statistics |date=9 September 1997 |publisher=Stanford News Service |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/97/970910greenspan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred a system that would increase the money supply at some fixed rate, and he thought that "leaving monetary and banking arrangements to the market would have produced a more satisfactory outcome than was actually achieved through government involvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebeling |first=Richard M. |title=Monetary Central Planning and the State, Part 27: Milton Friedman's Second Thoughts on the Costs of Paper Money |date=1 March 1999 |url=http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/monetary-central-planning-state-part-27-milton-friedmans-thoughts-costs-paper-money/ |website=fff.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Friedman's argument that the Fed did too little to ease after the crisis, [[Murray Rothbard]] argued that the crisis was caused by the Fed being too loose in the 1920s in book ''[[America's Great Depression]]''.

==Global financial crisis (2007–08)==
{{Main|Financial crisis of 2007–08}}
Some economists, such as [[John B. Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703481004574646100272016422 |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |title=The Fed and the Crisis: A Reply to Ben Bernanke |first=John B. |last=Taylor |authorlink=John B. Taylor |date=10 January 2010 |accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have asserted that the Fed was responsible, or at least partially responsible, for the [[United States housing bubble]] which occurred prior to the 2007 recession. They claim that the Fed kept interest rates too low following the [[Early 2000s recession|2001 recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123811225716453243 |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=David |last=Henderson |title=Did the Fed Cause the Housing Bubble? |date=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The housing bubble then led to the credit crunch. Then-Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] disputes this interpretation. He points out that the Fed's control over the long-term interest rates (to which critics refer) is only indirect. The Fed did raise the short-term interest rate over which it has control (i.e. the federal funds rate), but the long-term interest rate (which usually follows the former) did not increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business-july-dec07-greenspan_09-18/ |publisher=NewsHour Productions LLC.|work=PBS Newshour |title=Greenspan Examines Federal Reserve, Mortgage Crunch|date=September 18, 2007|author1=Jim Lehrer|others=Alan Greenspan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marc |last=Labonte |first2=Gail E. |last2=Makinen |title=Federal Reserve Interest Rate Changes: 2000-2008 |date=19 March 2008 |url=http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/98-856_20080319.pdf |website=assets.opencrs.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230115850/http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/98-856_20080319.pdf |archivedate=30 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Reserve's role as a supervisor and regulator has been criticized as being ineffective. Former U.S. Senator [[Chris Dodd]], then-chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]], remarked about the Fed's role in the present economic crisis, "We saw over the last number of years when they took on consumer protection responsibilities and the regulation of bank holding companies, it was an abysmal failure."

==Republican and Tea Party criticism==
During several recent elections, the [[Tea Party movement]] has made the Federal Reserve a major point of attack, which has been picked up by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates across the country. Former Congressman [[Ron Paul]] (R) of Texas and his son Senator [[Rand Paul]] (R) of Kentucky have long attacked the Fed, arguing that it is hurting the economy by devaluing the dollar. They argue that its monetary policies cause booms and busts when the Fed creates too much or too little [[fiat money]]. Ron Paul's book ''[[End the Fed]]'' repeatedly points out that the Fed engages in [[money creation]] "out of thin air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Paul|title=End the Fed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3vkxGyQ-BQC&amp;q=%22out%20of%20thin%20air%22|date=2009|publisher=Grand Central Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes: 
{{cquote|The fact that the Fed can create trillions of dollars and distribute them to its cronies without congressional oversight should shock us all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Paul|title=End the Fed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3vkxGyQ-BQC&amp;q=%22out%20of%20thin%20air%22|date=2009|page=10|publisher=Grand Central Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He also agrees with Friedman and Bernanke that the Fed caused the Great Depression, but in a different way: 
{{cquote|The fault [for the Depression] indeed does lie with the Federal Reserve—but obviously for opposite reasons. It was the credit expansion of the 1920s causing the stock market bubble that was the real cause of the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Paul|title=End the Fed| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3vkxGyQ-BQC&amp;lpg=PP68&amp;q=%22The%20fault%20indeed%20does%20lie%20with%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%22|date=2009|page=68|publisher=Grand Central Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Private ownership or control==

According to the [[Congressional Research Service]]:

{{quote|Because the regional Federal Reserve Banks are privately owned, and most of their directors are chosen by their stockholders, it is common to hear assertions that control of the Fed is in the hands of an elite. In particular, it has been rumored that control is in the hands of a very few people holding "class A stock" in the Fed.}}

{{quote|As explained, there is no stock in the ''system'', only in each regional Bank. More important, ''individuals do not own stock'' in Federal Reserve Banks. The stock is held only by banks who are members of the system. Each bank holds stock proportionate to its capital. Ownership and membership are synonymous. Moreover, ''there is no such thing as "class A" stock''. All stock is the same.}}

{{quote|This stock, furthermore, does not carry with it the normal rights and privileges of ownership. Most significantly, member banks, in voting for the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of which they are a member, do not get voting rights in proportion to the stock they hold. Instead, each member bank regardless of size gets one vote. ''Concentration of ownership of Federal Reserve Bank stock, therefore, is irrelevant to the issue of control of the system'' (italics in original).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. Thomas |last=Woodward |journal=Report No. 96–672 E |title=Money and the Federal Reserve System: Myth and Reality |publisher=Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress |date=31 July 1996 |url=http://home.hiwaay.net/~becraft/FRS-myth.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the web site for the Federal Reserve System, the individual Federal Reserve Banks "are the operating arms of the central banking system, and they combine both public and private elements in their makeup and organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Federal Reserve System: Purposes and Functions |edition=9th |date=June 2005 |accessdate=30 December 2014 |publisher=Federal Reserve |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pdf/pf_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each bank has a nine-member board of directors: three elected by the commercial banks in the Bank's region, and six chosen – three each by the member banks and the Board of Governors – "to represent the public with due consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor and consumers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What We Do |date=March 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2014 |url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/whatwedo.html |website=New York Fed}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regional banks are in turn controlled by the [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]], whose members are appointed by the [[President of the United States]].

Member banks ("[a]bout 38 percent of the nation's more than 8,000 banks")&lt;ref name="factcheck"&gt;{{cite web |title=Federal Reserve Bank Ownership |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2014 |url=http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/federal-reserve-bank-ownership/ |website=Factcheck.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; are required to own capital stock in their regional banks,&lt;ref name="factcheck" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Cornell University Law School |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/282- |title=12 U.S.C. § 282 et seq.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the regional banks pay a set 6% dividend on the member banks' paid-in capital stock (not the regional banks' profits) each year, returning the rest to the [[US Treasury Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Cornell University Law School |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/289- |title=12 U.S.C. § 289(a)(1)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fed has noted that this has created "some confusion about 'ownership'":

{{quote|[Although] the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks...owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company. The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership in the System. The stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan….&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who owns the Federal Reserve? |accessdate=30 December 2014 |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm |website=Federal Reserve}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his textbook, ''Monetary Policy and the Financial System'', Paul M. Horvitz, the former Director of Research for the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], stated,

{{quote|...the member banks can exert some rights of ownership by electing some members of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank [applicable to those member banks]. For all practical purposes, however, member bank ownership of the Federal Reserve System is merely a fiction. The Federal Reserve Banks are not operated for the purpose of earning profits for their stockholders. The Federal Reserve System does earn a profit in the normal course of its operations, but these profits, above the 6% statutory dividend, do not belong to the member banks. All net earnings after expenses and dividends are paid to the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul M. |last=Horvitz |title=Monetary Policy and the Financial System |edition=3rd |page=293 |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1974 |isbn=9780135998861}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the ''American Political Science Review'', Michael D. Reagan&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[Michael Reagan|Michael Edward Reagan]], the son of President [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;/ref&gt; wrote,

{{quote|...the "ownership" of the Reserve Banks by the commercial banks is symbolic; they do not exercise the proprietary control associated with the concept of ownership nor share, beyond the statutory dividend, in Reserve Bank "profits." ...Bank ownership and election at the base are therefore devoid of substantive significance, despite the superficial appearance of private bank control that the formal arrangement creates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael D. |last=Reagan |title=The Political Structure of the Federal Reserve System |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=55 |date=March 1961 |pages=64–76 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1976050?sid=21104958584311&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737592&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=70 |doi=10.2307/1976050}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Money and Banking: Theory, Analysis, and Policy |page=153 |first=S. |last=Mittra |publisher=Random House |place=New York |year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Transparency issues==
One critique is that the [[Federal Open Market Committee]], which is part of the Federal Reserve System, lacks transparency and is not sufficiently audited.&lt;ref name="secrecy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3678/is_200207/ai_n9146787 |title= Untold story of FOMC: Secrecy is exaggerated |last=Poole |first=William |date=July 2002 |publisher=St. Louis Federal Reserve |authorlink=William Poole (Federal Reserve Bank president)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by [[Bloomberg News]] asserts that the majority of Americans believes that the System should be held more accountable or that it should be abolished.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-2010-poll"&gt;{{cite web |first=Joshua |last=Zumbrun |title=Majority of Americans Say Fed Should Be Reined In or Abolished, Poll Shows |website=Bloomberg |date=9 December 2010 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-09/more-than-half-of-americans-want-fed-reined-in-or-abolished.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critique is the contention that the public should have a right to know what goes on in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.&lt;ref name="transparency"&gt;{{cite journal |first=William |last=Poole |title=FOMC Transparency |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis |journal=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review |volume=87 |pages=1–9 |date=6 October 2004 |url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/historical/frbsl_history/presidents/poole/20041006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="transp_greenspan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2001/20011011/default.htm |title=Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan - Transparency in monetary policy |website=Federal Reserve |date=11 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="transp_ferguson"&gt;{{cite web |title=Remarks by Vice Chairman Roger W.

A '''disruptive physician''' is a [[physician]] whose obnoxious behaviour upsets patients or other staff.  The [[American Medical Association]] defines this in their code of [[medical ethics]] as "personal conduct, whether verbal or physical, that negatively affects or that potentially may affect patient care".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ar9Wn_aeCwQC&amp;pg=PA133 |pages=131–152 |title=Professionalism in Psychiatry |chapter=The Disruptive Physician |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub. |year=2011 |isbn=9781585623372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion9045.page |title=AMA Code of Medical Ethics |chapter=Physicians with Disruptive Behavior |year=2000 |publisher=[[American Medical Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/code-medical-ethics/9045a.pdf |title=Physicians With Disruptive Behavior |author=Herbert Rakatansky |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors are also noted as causing adverse effects such as morale, focus and concentration, team work, collaboration and communication. Starting in 2009, The [[Joint Commission]] which [[accreditation|accredits]] hospitals in the United States requires them to have a written [[code of conduct]] addressing this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/health/02rage.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Arrogant, Abusive and Disruptive — and a Doctor |author=Laurie Tarkan |date=December 1, 2008 |journal=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This code of conduct defines acceptable, disruptive, and unacceptable behavior in the workplace. Along with these definitions of behaviors the Joint Commission also wrote ways to manage these behaviors in order to fix them.

An '''economic bubble''' or '''asset bubble''' (sometimes also referred to as a '''speculative bubble''', a '''market bubble''', a '''price bubble''', a '''financial bubble''', a '''speculative mania''', or a '''balloon''') is trade in an [[asset]] at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's [[Intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]].&lt;ref name="robustness"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Robustness of Bubbles and Crashes in Experimental Stock Markets |title=Nonlinear Dynamics and Evolutionary Economics |last1=King |first1=Ronald R. |last2=Smith |first2=Vernon L. |last3=Williams |first3=Arlington W. |last4=van Boening |first4=Mark V. |editor1-first=R.

Because it is often difficult to observe intrinsic values in real-life markets, bubbles are often conclusively identified only in retrospect, once a sudden drop in prices has occurred. Such a drop is known as a ''[[asset price crash|crash]]'' or a ''bubble burst''. Both the [[Economic boom|boom]] and the [[Recession|burst]] phases of the bubble are examples of a [[positive feedback]] mechanism, in contrast to the [[negative feedback]] mechanism that determines the [[equilibrium price]] under normal market circumstances. Prices in an economic bubble can fluctuate erratically, and become impossible to predict from supply and demand alone.

While some economists deny that bubbles occur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias |last=Garber |first=Peter |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-262-57153-6 |page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2012}} the cause(s) of bubbles remains disputed by those who are convinced that asset prices often deviate strongly from intrinsic values.

In such cases, the bubbles may be argued to be rational, where investors at every point are fully compensated for the possibility that the bubble might collapse by higher returns. These approaches require that the timing of the bubble collapse can only be forecast probabilistically and the bubble process is often modelled using a Markov switching model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brooks |first1=Chris |authorlink1=Chris Brooks (academic) |last2=Katsaris |first2=Apostolos |date=2005 |title=A three-regime model of speculative behaviour: modelling the evolution of the S&amp;P 500 composite index |journal=The Economic Journal |volume=115 |issue=505 |pages=767–797 |ISSN=1468-0297 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2005.01019.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brooks |first1=Chris |authorlink1=Chris Brooks (academic) |last2=Katsaris |first2=Apostolos |title=Trading rules from forecasting the collapse of speculative bubbles for the S&amp;P 500 composite index |date=2005 |journal=Journal of Business |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=2003–2036 |ISSN= 0740-9168 |doi=10.1086/431450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar explanations suggest that bubbles might ultimately be caused by processes of price coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/rfs/hhi003 |last=Hommes |first=Cars |authorlink= |author2=Sonnemans, Joep |author3=Tuinstra, Jan |author4= Velden, Henk van de  |year=2005 |title=Coordination of Expectations in Asset Pricing Experiments |journal=Review of Financial Studies |volume=18 |issue= 3|pages=955–980 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recent theories of asset bubble formation suggest that these events are sociologically driven. For instance, explanations have focused on emerging social norms&lt;ref name="levineknow" /&gt; and the role that culturally-situated stories or narratives play in these events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History and origin of term ==
{{See also|Economic history of the Dutch Republic|Financial history of the Dutch Republic|Tulip mania}}
[[File:Jan Brueghel the Younger, Satire on Tulip Mania, c. 1640.jpg|thumb|[[Jan Brueghel the Younger]]'s ''A Satire of Tulip Mania'' (ca. 1640) [[singerie|depicts speculators as brainless monkeys]] in contemporary upper-class dress. The ''[[tulip mania]]'' (also known as ''Tulipmania'' or ''[[Tulipomania]]''), of the 1630s, is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble or economic bubble.]]
[[File:South Sea Bubble Cards-Tree.png|thumb|A card from the [[South Sea Bubble]]]]
The term "bubble", in reference to [[financial crisis]], originated in the 1711–1720 British [[South Sea Bubble]], and originally referred to the companies themselves, and their inflated stock, rather than to the crisis itself. This was one of the earliest modern financial crises; other episodes were referred to as "manias", as in the Dutch [[tulip mania]]. The metaphor indicated that the prices of the stock were inflated and fragile – expanded based on nothing but air, and vulnerable to a sudden burst, as in fact occurred.

Some later commentators have extended the metaphor to emphasize the suddenness, suggesting that economic bubbles end "All at once, and nothing first, / Just as bubbles do when they burst,"&lt;ref&gt;Quote from ''{{ws2|The Deacon's Masterpiece}}'' or ''The One-Hoss Shay,'' by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]]&lt;/ref&gt; though theories of financial crises such as [[debt-deflation]] and the [[Financial Instability Hypothesis]] suggest instead that bubbles burst ''progressively,'' with the most vulnerable (most highly-[[Leverage (finance)|leveraged]]) assets failing first, and then the collapse spreading throughout the economy.

==Impact==
The impact of economic bubbles is debated within and between [[schools of economic thought]]; they are not generally considered beneficial, but it is debated how harmful their formation and bursting is.

Within [[mainstream economics]], many believe that bubbles cannot be identified in advance, cannot be prevented from forming, that attempts to "prick" the bubble may cause [[financial crisis]], and that instead authorities should wait for bubbles to burst of their own accord, dealing with the aftermath via [[monetary policy]] and [[fiscal policy]].

[[Political economist]] [[Robert E. Wright]] argues that bubbles can be identified before the fact with high confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Wright, ''Fubarnomics: A Lighthearted, Serious Look at America's Economic Ills'' (Buffalo, N.Y.: Prometheus, 2010), 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the crash which usually follows an economic bubble can destroy a large amount of wealth and cause continuing economic malaise; this view is particularly associated with the [[debt-deflation]] theory of [[Irving Fisher]], and elaborated within [[Post-Keynesian economics]].

A protracted period of low risk premiums can simply prolong the downturn in asset price deflation as was the case of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s for much of the world and the 1990s for [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japan]].  Not only can the aftermath of a crash devastate the economy of a nation, but its effects can also reverberate beyond its borders.

=== Effect upon spending ===
Another important aspect of economic bubbles is their impact on spending habits. Market participants with overvalued assets tend to spend more because they "feel" richer (the [[wealth effect]]). Many observers quote the [[Real estate economics|housing market]] in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and parts of the United States in recent times, as an example of this effect. When the bubble inevitably bursts, those who hold on to these overvalued assets usually experience a feeling of reduced wealth and tend to cut discretionary spending at the same time, hindering economic growth or, worse, exacerbating the economic slowdown.

In an economy with a central bank, the bank may therefore attempt to keep an eye on asset price appreciation and take measures to curb high levels of speculative activity in financial assets.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  This is usually done by increasing the [[interest rate]] (that is, the cost of borrowing money). (Historically, this is not the only approach taken by central banks.  It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold-eagle.com/editorials/cscb001.html|title=The Role of a Central Bank in a Bubble Economy  - Section I - Gold Eagle|website=www.gold-eagle.com|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they should stay out of it and let the bubble, if it is one, take its course.)

==Possible causes==
In the 1970s, excess monetary expansion after the U.S. came off the [[gold standard]] (August 1971) created massive commodities bubbles.  These bubbles only ended when the U.S. Central Bank (Federal Reserve) finally reined in the excess money, raising federal funds interest rates to over 14%.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The commodities bubble popped and prices of oil and gold, for instance, came down to their proper levels.  Similarly, low interest rate policies by the U.S. Federal Reserve in the 2001–2004 are believed to have exacerbated housing and commodities bubbles.  The housing bubble popped as [[Subprime lending|subprime mortgages]] began to default at much higher rates than expected, which also coincided with the rising of the [[Federal funds rate|fed funds rate]].

It has also been variously suggested that bubbles may be rational,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garber |first=Peter M. |authorlink= |year=1990 |title=Famous First Bubbles |journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=4 |issue= 2|pages=35–54 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1257/jep.4.2.35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; intrinsic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Froot |first=Kenneth A. |authorlink= |author2=Obstfeld, Maurice |year=1991 |title=Intrinsic Bubbles: The Case of Stock Prices |journal=American Economic Review |volume=81 |issue= |pages=1189–1214 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.3386/w3091}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contagious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2233855 |last=Topol |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=1991 |title=Bubbles and Volatility of Stock Prices: Effect of Mimetic Contagion |journal=The Economic Journal |volume=101 |issue= 407|pages=786–800 |jstor=2233855 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, there is no widely accepted theory to explain their occurrence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recent computer-generated agency models suggest excessive leverage could be a key factor in causing financial bubbles.&lt;ref name="Buchanan2008" /&gt;

Puzzlingly for some, bubbles occur even in highly predictable experimental markets, where uncertainty is eliminated and market participants should be able to calculate the intrinsic value of the assets simply by examining the expected stream of dividends.&lt;ref name="smithbub"/&gt; Nevertheless, bubbles have been observed repeatedly in experimental markets, even with participants such as business students, managers, and professional traders. Experimental bubbles have proven robust to a variety of conditions, including short-selling, margin buying, and insider trading.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="robustness"/&gt;

While there is no clear agreement on what causes bubbles, there is evidence{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} to suggest that they are not caused by [[bounded rationality]] or assumptions about the irrationality of others, as assumed by [[greater fool theory]]. It has also been shown that bubbles appear even when market participants are well-capable of pricing assets correctly.&lt;ref name="levineknow"/&gt; Further, it has been shown that bubbles appear even when [[speculation]] is not possible&lt;ref name="leinonspec"/&gt; or when over-confidence is absent.&lt;ref name="levineknow"/&gt;

More recent theories of asset bubble formation suggest that they are likely sociologically-driven events, thus explanations that merely involve fundamental factors or snippets of human behavior are incomplete at best. For instance, qualitative researchers Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg argue that market speculation is driven by culturally-situated [https://web.archive.org/web/20161110181646/http://soq.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/02/09/1476127016629880.abstract narratives] that are deeply embedded in and supported by the prevailing institutions of the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They cite factors such as bubbles forming during periods of innovation, easy credit, loose regulations, and internationalized investment as reasons why narratives play such an influential role in the growth of asset bubbles. 

===Liquidity===
One possible cause of bubbles is excessive monetary liquidity in the financial system, inducing lax or inappropriate lending standards by the [[bank]]s, which makes markets vulnerable to volatile asset price inflation caused by short-term, leveraged speculation.&lt;ref name="Buchanan2008"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Buchanan |title=Why economic theory is out of whack |work=New Scientist |page= |date=19 July 2008 |accessdate=15 December 2008 |url=http://forum.globalhousepricecrash.com/index.php?act=attach&amp;type=post&amp;id=4127 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219004510/http://forum.globalhousepricecrash.com/index.php?act=attach&amp;type=post&amp;id=4127 |archivedate=19 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Axel A. Weber]], the former president of the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]], has argued that "The past has shown that an overly generous provision of liquidity in global financial markets in connection with a very low level of interest rates promotes the formation of asset-price bubbles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=snyQDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=%22The+past+has+shown+that+an+overly+generous+provision+of+liquidity+in+global+financial+markets+in+connection+with+a+very+low+level+of+interest+rates+promotes+the+formation+of+asset-price+bubbles.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uQEmdCsrqd&amp;sig=VORFXVbDzZS6yhbloO2QHjOn-FU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj545iosvndAhVKL8AKHVY6AlkQ6AEwA3oECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20past%20has%20shown%20that%20an%20overly%20generous%20provision%20of%20liquidity%20in%20global%20financial%20markets%20in%20connection%20with%20a%20very%20low%20level%20of%20interest%20rates%20promotes%20the%20formation%20of%20asset-price%20bubbles.%22&amp;f=false|title=Bubbles and Contagion in Financial Markets, Volume 1: An Integrative View|last=Porras|first=E.|date=2016-06-29|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137358769|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the explanation, excessive monetary liquidity (easy credit, large disposable incomes) potentially occurs while fractional reserve banks are implementing expansionary monetary policy (i.e. lowering of interest rates and flushing the financial system with money supply); this explanation may differ in certain details according to economic philosophy. Those who believe the money supply is controlled [[exogeny|exogenously]] by a central bank may attribute an 'expansionary monetary policy' to said bank and (should one exist) a governing body or institution; others who believe that the money supply is created endogenously by the banking sector may attribute such a 'policy' with the behavior of the financial sector itself, and view the state as a passive or reactive factor.  This may determine how central or relatively minor/inconsequential policies like [[fractional reserve banking]] and the central bank's efforts to raise or lower short-term interest rates are to one's view on the creation, inflation and ultimate implosion of an economic bubble.  Explanations focusing on interest rates tend to take on a common form, however: When interest rates are set excessively low, (regardless of the mechanism by which it is accomplished) investors tend to avoid putting their capital into savings accounts. Instead, investors tend to leverage their capital by borrowing from banks and invest the leveraged capital in financial assets such as [[stock]]s and [[real estate]].  Risky leveraged behavior like speculation and [[Ponzi scheme]]s can lead to an increasingly fragile economy, and may also be part of what pushes asset prices artificially upward until the bubble pops.

{{quote box|width = 300px|quote=But these [ongoing economic crises] aren’t just a series of unrelated accidents. Instead, what we’re seeing is what happens when too much money is chasing too few investment opportunities.|source=[[Paul Krugman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Krugman, Paul | date = August 24, 2015 | title=A Movable Glut|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/24/opinion/a-moveable-glut.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region |accessdate= August 24, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Simply put, economic bubbles often occur when too much money is chasing too few assets, causing both good assets and bad assets to appreciate excessively beyond their fundamentals to an unsustainable level.  Once the bubble bursts, the fall in prices causes the collapse of unsustainable investment schemes (especially speculative and/or Ponzi investments, but not exclusively so), which leads to a crisis of consumer (and investor) confidence that may result in a financial panic and/or financial crisis; if there is monetary authority like a central bank, it may be forced to take a number of measures in order to soak up the liquidity in the financial system or risk a collapse of its currency.  This may involve actions like bailouts of the financial system, but also others that reverse the trend of monetary accommodation, commonly termed forms of 'contractionary monetary policy'.

Some of these measures may include raising interest rates, which tends to make investors become more risk averse and thus avoid leveraged capital because the costs of borrowing may become too expensive; others may include certain countermeasures that may be taken pre-emptively during periods of strong economic growth include having the central monetary authority increase capital reserve requirements and attempting to implement regulation that checks and/or prevents processes leading to over-expansion and excessive leveraging of debt.  Ideally, such countermeasures lessen the impact of a downturn by strengthening financial institutions while the economy is strong.

Advocates of perspectives stressing the role of credit money in an economy often refer to (such) bubbles as "credit bubbles," and look at such measures of [[financial leverage]] as [[debt-to-GDP ratio]]s to identify bubbles.  Typically the collapse of any economic bubble results in an economic contraction termed (if less severe) a recession or (if more severe) a depression; what economic policies to follow in reaction to such a contraction is a hotly debated perennial topic of political economy.

The importance of liquidity was derived in a mathematical setting&lt;ref name="caginalpBalenovich"/&gt; and in an experimental setting&lt;ref name="caginalpPorterSmith1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="caginalpPorterSmith2001"/&gt; (see Section "Experimental and mathematical economics").

===Social psychology factors===

====Greater fool theory====
{{main|Greater fool theory}}
[[Greater fool theory]] states that bubbles are driven by the behavior of perennially optimistic market participants (the fools) who buy overvalued assets in anticipation of selling it to other speculators (the greater fools) at a much higher price. According to this explanation, the bubbles continue as long as the fools can find greater fools to pay up for the overvalued asset. The bubbles will end only when the greater fool becomes the greatest fool who pays the top price for the overvalued asset and can no longer find another buyer to pay for it at a higher price.  This theory is popular among laity but has not yet been fully confirmed by empirical research.&lt;ref name="leinonspec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="levineknow"/&gt;

====Extrapolation====
{{quote box|width = 300px|quote= The term “bubble” should indicate a price that no reasonable future outcome can justify.|source=[[Clifford Asness]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Righoltz, Barry | date = December 6, 2013 | title=How do you define a bubble?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-12-06/how-do-you-define-a-bubble-and-are-we-in-one-now-|accessdate= November 11, 2016|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Extrapolation]] is projecting historical data into the future on the same basis; if prices have risen at a certain rate in the past, they will continue to rise at that rate forever. The argument is that investors tend to extrapolate past extraordinary returns on investment of certain assets into the future, causing them to overbid those risky assets in order to attempt to continue to capture those same rates of return.

Overbidding on certain assets will at some point result in uneconomic rates of return for investors; only then the asset price deflation will begin.  When investors feel that they are no longer well compensated for holding those risky assets, they will start to demand higher rates of return on their investments.

====Herding====
Another related explanation used in [[behavioral finance]] lies in [[herd behavior]], the fact that investors tend to buy or sell in the direction of the market trend.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon D, Lagi M, de Aguiar MAM, Chinellato DD, Braha D, Epstein IR, et al. (2015). [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131871 “Anticipating Economic Market Crises Using Measures of Collective Panic.”] PLoS ONE 10(7): e0131871.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0131871.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandon Keim. (2011). “Possible Early Warning Sign for Market Crashes.” Wired, 03.18.11. https://www.wired.com/2011/03/market-panic-signs/&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes helped by [[technical analysis]] that tries precisely to detect those trends and follow them, which creates a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].

Investment managers, such as stock [[mutual fund]] managers, are compensated and retained in part due to their performance relative to peers. Taking a conservative or contrarian position as a bubble builds results in performance unfavorable to peers.  This may cause customers to go elsewhere and can affect the investment manager's own employment or compensation. The typical short-term focus of U.S. equity markets exacerbates the risk for investment managers that do not participate during the building phase of a bubble, particularly one that builds over a longer period of time. In attempting to maximize returns for clients and maintain their employment, they may rationally participate in a bubble they believe to be forming, as the risks of not doing so outweigh the benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200812/blodget-wall-street|title=Why Wall Street Always Blows It|first=Henry|last=Blodget|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Moral hazard====
[[Moral hazard]] is the prospect that a party insulated from risk may behave differently from the way it would behave if it were fully exposed to the risk. A person's belief that they are responsible for the consequences of their own actions is an essential aspect of rational behavior. An investor must balance the possibility of making a return on their investment with the risk of making a loss – the [[Risk-return spectrum|risk-return]] relationship. A moral hazard can occur when this relationship is interfered with, often via [[government policy]].

A recent example is the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP), signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on 3 October 2008 to provide a Government bailout for many financial and non-financial institutions who speculated in high-risk financial instruments during the housing boom condemned by a 2005 story in ''[[The Economist]]'' titled "The worldwide rise in house prices is the biggest bubble in history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In come the waves: The worldwide rise in house prices is the biggest bubble in history. Prepare for the economic pain when it pops. | work=[[The Economist]] | date=16 June 2005 |
url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4079027 | quote=The worldwide rise in house prices is the biggest bubble in history. Prepare for the economic pain when it pops. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A historical example was [[Tulip mania#Legal changes|intervention by the Dutch Parliament during the great Tulip Mania of 1637]].

Other causes of perceived insulation from risk may derive from a given entity's predominance in a market relative to other players, and not from state intervention or market regulation. A firm – or several large firms acting in concert (see [[cartel]], [[oligopoly]] and [[collusion]]) – with very large holdings and capital reserves could instigate a market bubble by investing heavily in a given asset, creating a relative scarcity which drives up that asset's price. Because of the signaling power of the large firm or group of colluding firms, the firm's smaller competitors will follow suit, similarly investing in the asset due to its price gains.

However, in relation to the party instigating the bubble, these smaller competitors are insufficiently leveraged to withstand a similarly rapid decline in the asset’s price. When the large firm, cartel or ''de facto'' collusive body perceives a maximal peak has been reached in the traded asset's price, it can then proceed to rapidly sell or "dump" its holdings of this asset on the market, precipitating a price decline that forces its competitors into insolvency, bankruptcy or foreclosure.

The large firm or cartel – which has intentionally leveraged itself to withstand the price decline it engineered – can then acquire the capital of its failing or devalued competitors at a low price as well as capture a greater market share (e.g., via a [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger or acquisition]] which expands the dominant firm's distribution chain).  If the bubble-instigating party is itself a lending institution, it can combine its knowledge of its borrowers’ leveraging positions with publicly available information on their stock holdings, and strategically shield or expose them to default.

===Other possible causes===
Some regard bubbles as related to [[inflation]] and thus believe that the causes of inflation are also the causes of bubbles. Others take the view that there is a "fundamental value" to an [[asset]], and that bubbles represent a rise over that fundamental value, which must eventually return to that fundamental value. There are chaotic theories of bubbles which assert that bubbles come from particular "critical" states in the market based on the communication of economic factors. Finally, others regard bubbles as necessary consequences of irrationally valuing assets solely based upon their returns in the recent past without resorting to a rigorous [[Fundamental analysis|analysis based on their underlying "fundamentals"]].

===Experimental and mathematical economics===
Bubbles in financial markets have been studied not only through historical evidence, but also through [[Experimental economics|experiments]], [[mathematical economics|mathematical]] and statistical works. Smith, Suchanek and Williams&lt;ref name="smithbub"/&gt; designed a set of experiments in which an asset that gave a dividend with expected value 24 cents at the end of each of 15 periods (and were subsequently worthless) was traded through a computer network. Classical economics would predict that the asset would start trading near $3.60 (15 times $0.24) and decline by 24 cents each period. They found instead that prices started well below this fundamental value and rose far above the expected return in dividends. The bubble subsequently crashed before the end of the experiment. This laboratory bubble has been repeated hundreds of times in many economics laboratories in the world, with similar results.

The existence of bubbles and crashes in such a simple context was unsettling for the economics community that tried to resolve the paradox on various features of the experiments. To address these issues Porter and Smith&lt;ref name="portersmith"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Porter |first=D. |authorlink= |author2=Smith, V. L. |year=1994 |title=Stock market bubbles in the laboratory |journal=Applied Mathematical Finance |volume=1 |issue= 2|pages=111–128 |doi=10.1080/13504869400000008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others performed a series of experiments in which short selling, margin trading, professional traders all led to bubbles a fortiori.

Much of the puzzle has been resolved through mathematical modeling and additional experiments. In particular, starting in 1989, Gunduz Caginalp and collaborators&lt;ref name="caginalpBalenovich"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caginalp |first=G. |authorlink= |author2=Balenovich, D. |year=1999 |title=Asset flow and momentum:  deterministic and stochastic equations |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] |volume=357 |issue= 1758|pages=2119–2133 |doi=10.1098/rsta.1999.0421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caginalpErmentrout"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caginalp |first=G. |authorlink= |author2=Ermentrout, G. B. |year=1990 |title=A kinetic thermodynamics approach to the psychology of fluctuations in financial markets |journal=Applied Mathematics Letters |volume=4 |issue= 4|pages=17–19 |doi=10.1016/0893-9659(90)90038-D }}&lt;/ref&gt; modeled the trading with two concepts that are generally missing in classical economics and finance. First, they assumed that supply and demand of an asset depended not only on valuation, but on factors such as the price trend. Second, they assumed that the available cash and asset are finite (as they are in the laboratory). This is contrary to the “infinite arbitrage” that is generally assumed to exist, and to eliminate deviations from fundamental value. Utilizing these assumptions together with differential equations, they predicted the following: (a) The bubble would be larger if there was initial undervaluation. Initially, “value-based” traders would buy the undervalued asset creating an uptrend, which would then attract the “momentum” traders and a bubble would be created. (b) When the initial ratio of cash to asset value in a given experiment was increased, they predicted that the bubble would be larger.

An epistemological difference between most microeconomic modeling and these works is that the latter offer an opportunity to test implications of their theory in a quantitative manner. This opens up the possibility of comparison between experiments and world markets.

These predictions were confirmed in experiments&lt;ref name="caginalpPorterSmith1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caginalp |first=G. |authorlink= |author2=Porter, D. |author3=Smith, V.L.  |year=1998 |title=Initial cash/asset ratio and asset prices:  an experimental study |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=95 |issue= 2|pages=756–761 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.2.756 |pmc=18494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caginalpPorterSmith2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caginalp |first=G. |authorlink= |author2=Porter, D. |author3=Smith, V.L.  |year=2001 |title=Financial Bubbles: Excess Cash, Momentum and Incomplete Information |journal=J. Psychology and Financial Markets |volume=2 |issue= 2|pages=80–99 |doi=10.1207/S15327760JPFM0202_03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that showed the importance of “excess cash” (also called liquidity, though this term has other meanings), and trend-based investing in creating bubbles. When price collars were used to keep prices low in the initial time periods, the bubble became larger. In experiments in which L= (total cash)/(total initial value of asset) were doubled, the price at the peak of the bubble nearly doubled. This provided valuable evidence for the argument that “cheap money fuels markets.”

Caginalp's asset flow differential equations provide a link between the laboratory experiments and world market data. Since the parameters can be calibrated with either market, one can compare the lab data with the world market data.

The asset flow equations stipulate that price trend is a factor in the supply and demand for an asset that is a key ingredient in the formation of a bubble. While many studies of market data have shown a rather minimal trend effect, the work of Caginalp and DeSantis&lt;ref name="caginalpDeSantis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caginalp |first=G. |authorlink= |author2=DeSantis, M. |year=2011 |title=Stock Price Dynamics: Nonlinear Trend, Volume, Volatility, Resistance and Money Supply |journal=Quantitative Finance |volume=11 |issue= 6|pages=849–861 |doi=10.1080/14697680903220356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on large scale data adjusts for changes in valuation, thereby illuminating a strong role for trend, and providing the empirical justification for the modeling.

The asset flow equations have been used to study the formation of bubbles from a different standpoint in&lt;ref name="caginalpDeSantisSwigon"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caginalp |first=G. |authorlink= |author2=DeSantis, M. |author3=Swigon, D.  |date=July 2011 |title=Are flash crashes caused by instabilities arising from rapid trading? |journal=Wilmott Magazine |volume=11 |issue= |pages=46–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was shown that a stable equilibrium could become unstable with the influx of additional cash or the change to a shorter time scale on the part of the momentum investors. Thus a stable equilibrium could be pushed into an unstable one, leading to a trajectory in price that exhibits a large “excursion” from either the initial stable point or the final stable point. This phenomenon on a short time scale may be the explanation for flash crashes.

== Stages of an economic bubble ==
According to the economist Charles P. Kindleberger, the basic structure of a speculative bubble can be divided into 5 phases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odlyzko |first1=Andrew |title=The British Railway Mania of the 1840s |journal=University of Minnesotta |url=http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/hallucinations.pdf |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tuckett |first1=David |last2=Taffler |first2=Richard |title=A Psychoanalytic Interpretation of Dot.Com Stock Valuations |journal=SSRN |url=https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=528094093074031101089003070092079027051081060000028091094066076023096066009064071087049101030035000120107082010001126075075043040054037014118064084014024092109031018002116126125009099066072000002099126021072000111114111123096027109072102082072074&amp;EXT=pdf |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Substitution: increase in the value of an asset
* Takeoff: speculative purchases (buy now to sell in the future at a higher price and obtain a profit)
* Exuberance: a state of unsustainable euphoria.
* Critical stage: begin to shorten the buyers, some begin to sell.
* Pop (crash): prices plummet

The Second Bank of the US called in loans for specie beginning in August 1818 popped the speculative land bubble. Prices of agricultural commodities declined by almost -50% during 1819-1821 post bubble. A credit contraction caused by a financial crisis in England drained specie out of the U.S. The Bank of the United States also contracted its lending.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation see Major deflations in the United States &lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February 1978, Egyptian special forces raided [[Larnaca International Airport]] near [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]], in an attempt to intervene in a [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]]. Earlier, two assassins had killed prominent Egyptian newspaper editor [[Yusuf Sibai]] and then rounded up as hostages several Arabs who were attending a convention in [[Nicosia]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=1978: Egyptian forces die in Cyprus gunfight | date=1978-02-19 | publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/19/newsid_2565000/2565701.stm | work =BBC | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-02 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Cypriot forces were trying to negotiate with the hostage-takers at the airport, Egyptian troops launched their own assault without authorization from the Cypriots. The unauthorized raid led to the Egyptians and the Cypriots exchanging gunfire, killing or injuring more than 20 of the Egyptian commandos.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; As a result, Egypt and Cyprus severed political ties for several years after the incident.

== Hijacking ==
In the late hours of 18 February 1978, Yusuf Sibai, editor of a prominent [[Egypt]]ian newspaper and a friend of the [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Anwar Sadat]], was [[assassinated]] by two gunmen at a convention being held at the [[Nicosia]] Hilton. The two assassins rounded up 16 Arab convention delegates as hostages (among them, two P.L.O. representatives and one Egyptian national) and demanded transportation to [[Larnaca International Airport]]. They also demanded and were supplied with a [[Cyprus Airways]] DC-8 aircraft. Following negotiations with the Cypriot authorities, the hijackers were allowed to fly the aircraft out of Cyprus with 11 hostages and four crew members. The aircraft, however, was denied permission to land in [[Djibouti]], [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and was forced to return and land in [[Cyprus]] a few hours later.

According to a report in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Sadat was aggrieved by the assassination of his personal friend and begged the Cypriot President, [[Spyros Kyprianou]] to rescue the hostages and extradite the terrorists to Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Murder and Massacre on Cyprus | date= March 6, 1978 | publisher= | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915969-2,00.html | work =[[Time Magazine]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cypriot President responded by promising to oversee the rescue operation and any negotiations personally, and travelled to the airport himself. According to the same report however, Sadat dispatched an elite [[Unit 777|antiterrorism unit]] (Task Force 777) to Cyprus aboard a [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft. Cairo merely informed Kyprianou that ''"people are on the way to help rescue the hostages"'' and did not reveal who was on board nor what their intentions were.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Upon landing in Cyprus, the Egyptian force immediately launched an all out assault, dispatching a single [[Jeep]] all-terrain vehicle with three men to race ahead of an estimated 58 troops (another report has this figure at 74&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19780219-1 |title=Criminal Occurrence description |accessdate=2008-02-02 |date=1978-02-19 |publisher=Aviation Safety Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;) moving towards the hijacked aircraft on foot.

== Egyptian raid ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
As the [[Egypt]]ian troops advanced quickly towards the hijacked DC-8 aircraft and the [[Cypriot National Guard]] forces who surrounded it, the Cypriot forces reportedly issued a single verbal warning to halt and submit, though in other reports, the Cypriots issued two verbal warnings, the second a demand for the Egyptians to return to their aircraft. As this occurred, the occupants of the Jeep and the Cypriot National Guardsmen exchanged gunfire, and the Egyptian Jeep was struck by a [[rocket propelled grenade]] (RPG), as well as gunfire, killing all three occupants. As the vehicle came to a halt, the [[Cyprus|Cypriots]] and the main Egyptian force confronted each other at a range of less than {{convert|300|m|yd}}, and it is variously reported that the Egyptians, who lacked any form of cover, dropped down onto the tarmac in prone firing positions. At this moment, the two forces engaged each other with heavy gunfire, and the Cypriots opened fire on the Egyptian C-130H aircraft with a 106&amp;nbsp;mm anti-tank missile, striking it in the nose and killing all three crew on board.

With their aircraft destroyed, the Egyptian force and the Cypriot National Guard exchanged heavy gunfire for nearly an hour in sporadic fighting on the open tarmac. Some of the Egyptian troops took cover in a nearby empty [[Air France]] aircraft.

Cypriot President Spyros Kyprianou, who was watching the events unfolding from the airport control tower, was forced to withdraw from the windows and take cover as Egyptian commandos struck the tower with automatic gunfire.

==Aftermath==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}
Of the Egyptian commando force, 15 men were killed, in addition to three crew of the C-130H Hercules transport aircraft who were killed when it was struck by a missile. An estimated 15 more Egyptian commandos were reported to have been taken injured to [[Larnaca]] General Hospital with gunshot wounds.

Following the assault, it emerged that the surrender of the two hostage-takers had already been secured at the time of the failed Egyptian attack, and the two men were taken prisoner by the Cypriots and later extradited to [[Egypt]], where they received death sentences, later commuted to life sentences.

On 20 February, Egypt recalled its diplomatic mission and requested the Cyprus government to do the same in Cairo. Cyprus requested the withdrawal of Egypt's military attaché.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Watts | coauthors= | title=Angry Egyptians call envoys home as Cyprus dispute grows | date=February 21, 1978 | publisher= | url=http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | work=[[The Times]] Digital Archive | pages=1; Issue 60242; col F | accessdate=2008-05-02 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030906202207/http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | archivedate=September 6, 2003 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James 'Fraser' Barron''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] &amp; [[Medal bar|Bar]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]], [[Distinguished Flying Medal|DFM]] (9 January 1921 &amp;ndash; 20 May 1944), was an officer of the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF) who was [[Killed in action|killed in flying operations]] during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=Record&gt;[http://muse.aucklandmuseum.com/databases/Cenotaph/20628.detail?Ordinal= James Fraser Barron].

Retrieved 2011-05-022.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron was one of only four New Zealanders to be awarded a bar to his DSO and was considered a standout bomber pilot of the war.

==Early life==
Barron was born on 9 January 1921 in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand. An average student, he was educated at a primary school in [[Oamaru]] and then [[Waitaki Boys' High School]]. In 1939, he was working in [[Wellington]] as a cadet in the Mines Department.&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;Lambert, Max (2005, pp. 184-187). [https://books.google.com/books?id=_71BAAAACAAJ&amp;dq ''Night After Night: New Zealanders in Bomber Command'']. Published by Harper Collins, Auckland. {{OCLC|238569316}}. {{ISBN|1-86950-542-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Barron enlisted in the RNZAF in June 1940 and commenced training early the following month.&lt;ref name=Avro&gt;[http://www.aviationartprints.com/aviation_art.php?ProdID=4096 Avro Lancaster Mk III ND845 MG-C.] Aviation Art Prints. Retrieved 22 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He went through training at [[Strath-Taieri|Taieri]] and [[Wigram]] with [[James Allen Ward|Jimmy Ward]], who was to win the [[Victoria Cross]]. Barron and Ward sailed together on the ''Aorangi'' in January 1941 and were both stationed at [[RAF Lossiemouth|20 OTU Lossiemouth]], in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=Lambert/&gt;

After leaving 20 OTC, where Barron and his crew survived a ditching in a [[Vickers Wellington]], he was posted to [[No. 15 Squadron RAF|15 Squadron]] stationed at [[RAF Wyton]] flying [[Short Stirling]]s.&lt;ref name=Avro/&gt; Through late 1941 and early 1942, Barron was quickly promoted to [[flight sergeant]] and then [[pilot officer]]. In May 1942, after 42 operations including the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|thousand bomber raids on Cologne]] and [[Bombing of Essen in World War II|Essen]], he won his first decoration, the [[Distinguished Flying Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/35574/supplement/2290&lt;/ref&gt; The citation read in part that Barron had completed many operational flights as captain of aircraft and proved most reliable, efficient and courageous in pressing home attacks regardless of opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19420527.2.39&amp;srpos=63&amp;e= Latest Honours]. Evening Post, Volume CXXXIII, Issue 123, 27 May 1942, Page 5. Retrieved 22 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Posted to [[Royal Air Force Conversion Units|No.1651 Conversion Unit]] at [[Waterbeach]] as an instructor, Barron preferred operational flying and in September 1942, he joined [[No. 7 Squadron RAF|7 Squadron]], a founding [[Pathfinder (RAF)|pathfinder unit]]. Barron would fly 16 sorties on this tour, during which he was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]], followed in December 1942 by the award of his Path Finder Force badge.&lt;ref name=Avro/&gt; At the end of his tour in February 1943, Barron was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for "courage, skill and determination".&lt;ref name=Lambert/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35894|supp=y|page=702|date=9 February 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fortnight later he was awarded his first [[Distinguished Service Order]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/35927/supplement/1073&lt;/ref&gt; for "exceptional gallantry and devotion to duty".&lt;ref name=Lambert/&gt; Promotions also quickly followed, to [[flight lieutenant]] (skipping the rank of flying officer) and [[squadron leader]], the latter when he was at No.11 OTU after finishing his second tour, by order of [[RAF Bomber Command]] headquarters.&lt;ref name=Lambert/&gt;

Tiring of the training environment, Barron eventually persuaded the [[group captain]] to approve his return to operations. Barron rejoined the now [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] equipped 7 Squadron in December 1943 and took part in several sorties including on the night of 19/20 February 1944, the [[Bombing of Leipzig in World War II#20 February 1944|Leipzig raid]], during which the [[Royal Air Force]] lost 78 bombers.&lt;ref name=Avro/&gt; He was promoted to [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] in February 1944 and on 28 April was appointed [[commanding officer]] 7 Squadron. Barron and his crew were now often used as Master Bomber to control bomber attacks and for one such attack on [[Nantes]] on 7 May 1944, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO). His citation read in part; This officer was captain of an aircraft detailed to attack Cologne. When nearing the target area his aircraft was held in a cone of searchlights and subjected to heavy fire from ground defences. Despite this, Flight Lieutenant Barron remained on his course, defying an intense and concentrated barrage and pressed home a successful attack on his second run over the target.&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;

Barron was awarded a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DSO on 16 June 1944;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/36566/supplement/2873&lt;/ref&gt; his citation read:

{{quote|One night in May 1944, this officer participated in an attack on an airfield at Nantes. By his appreciation of the responsibilities entrusted to him and the skill and precision with which he executed his attack, Wing Commander Barron contributed in a large measure to the success achieved. Since being awarded the Distinguished Service Order, this officer has taken part in many attacks on dangerous and difficult targets. He is an outstanding captain whose example of skill, bravery and determination has impressed all.&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;}}

On the night of 19/20 May 1944, while acting as master bomber (his 79th sortie in all), Barron was directing an attack on railway yards at [[Le Mans]], [[France]]. What exactly happened is debated, but a collision with his deputy's aircraft is considered the most likely event. The 15 men on the two 7 Squadron aircraft were all killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostbombers.co.uk/bomber.php?id=2760 Lancaster ND845 Information]. World War II Lost Bombers Database. Retrieved 24 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron was buried at Le Mans West Cemetery; he was 23 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2846498 Casualty Details: Barron, James Fraser]. Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Retrieved 22 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron was one of only four New Zealanders to be awarded a bar to his DSO and was considered an outstanding bomber pilot of the war.&lt;ref name=Lambert/&gt;

'''''Méduse''''' was a 40-gun [[Pallas class frigate (1808)|''Pallas''-class]] [[List of frigates of France|frigate]] of the [[French Navy]], launched in 1810. She took part in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], namely in the late stages of the [[Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811]] and in raids in the Caribbean.

In 1816, following the [[Bourbon Restoration]], ''Méduse'' was armed [[en flûte]] to ferry French officials to the port of [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], in [[Senegal]], to formally re-establish French occupation of the colony under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|First Peace of Paris]]. Through inept navigation by her captain, an [[Émigré#The French Revolution|émigré]] given command for political reasons but incompetent as a naval officer, ''Méduse'' struck the [[Arguin Bank|Bank of Arguin]] off the coast of present-day [[Mauritania]] and became a total loss.

Most of the 400 passengers on board evacuated, with 151 men forced to take refuge on an improvised raft towed by the frigate's [[launch (boat)|launches]]. The towing proved impractical, however, and the boats soon abandoned the raft and its passengers in the open ocean. Without any means of navigating to shore, the situation aboard the raft rapidly turned disastrous. Dozens were washed into the sea by a storm, while others, drunk from wine, rebelled and were killed by officers. When supplies ran low, several injured men were thrown into the sea, and some of the survivors resorted to [[cannibalism]]. After 13 days at sea, the raft was discovered with only 15 men still alive.&lt;ref&gt;''La véritable histoire du "Radeau de la Méduse"'', ARTE France &amp; Grand Angle Productions. TV documentary, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

News of the tragedy stirred considerable public emotion, making ''Méduse'' one of the most infamous [[shipwreck]]s of the [[Age of Sail]]. Two survivors, a surgeon and an officer, wrote a widely read [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11772/11772-8.txt book about the incident], and the episode was immortalised when [[Théodore Géricault]] painted ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', which became an iconic artwork of French [[Romanticism]].

==Service==

''Méduse'' was commissioned in [[Nantes]] on 26 September 1807.

===Napoleonic Wars===

[[File:Main batteries of Méduse-Garneray-IMG 4787-cropped.JPG|thumb|Gun deck of ''Méduse'']]
In 1811, she was sent off to [[Java]] with ''[[French frigate Nymphe (1811)|Nymphe]]'', in a frigate division under the command of [[Joseph-François Raoul]]. On 2 September, the frigates arrived at [[Surabaya]], tailed by the 32-gun frigate {{HMS|Bucephalus|1808|6}}. Two days later, another British ship, {{HMS|Barracouta|1807|6}}, joined the chase, but lost contact on 8 September. On 12 September, ''Méduse'' and ''Nymphe'' chased ''Bucephalus'', which escaped and broke contact the next day. ''Méduse'' was back in [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 22 December 1811. She then served in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and in 1814, she was part of the fleet sent to retake [[Guadeloupe]] in the [[Caribbean]].

===Bourbon Restoration===

With the [[Bourbon Restoration|restoration]] of the French monarchy in 1814, [[Louis XVIII]] decided to restore Royalist dominance of the senior ranks of both the [[French Navy]] and [[French Army|Army]]. Consequently, Viscount [[Hugues Duroy de Chaumareys]] was appointed ''[[Capitaine de frégate]]'' and given command of the ''Méduse'', even though he had hardly sailed in 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Zarzeczny, "Theodore Géricault's ‘The Raft of the Méduse’", ''Member's Bulletin of The Napoleonic Society of America'' (Fall 2001); Matthew Zarzeczny, "Theodore Géricault's ''The Raft of the Méduse'', Part II", ''Member's Bulletin of The Napoleonic Society of America'' (Spring 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course to Senegal==

[[File:Aftercastle of Meduse-Garneray-IMG 4780-cropped.JPG|thumb|[[Aftercastle]] of ''Méduse'', by [[Ambroise-Louis Garneray]]]]
[[File:Line-crossing ceremony aboard Méduse-Jules de Caudin-IMG 4783-cropped.JPG|thumb|[[Line-crossing ceremony]] aboard ''Méduse'' on 1 July 1816]]
On 17 June 1816, a convoy under the command of Chaumareys on ''Méduse'' departed [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] accompanied by the storeship ''Loire'', the [[brig]] [[HMS Plumper (1804)|''Argus'']] and the [[corvette]] ''Écho'' to receive the British handover of the port of [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] in [[Senegal]]. ''Méduse'', armed [[en flûte]], carried many passengers, including the appointed French governor of [[Senegal]], Colonel [[Julien Schmaltz|Julien-Désiré Schmaltz]], his wife Reine Schmaltz, and his secretary, Joseph Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Griffon du Bellay. ''Méduse''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s complement totaled 400, including 160 crew plus a contingent of marine infantrymen intended to serve as the garrison of Saint-Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles|last=Lavauzelle|page=30|title=Les Troupes de Marine 1622-1984|ISBN=2-7025-0142-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship reached the island of [[Madeira]] on 27 June.

Schmaltz then wanted to reach Saint-Louis as fast as possible, by the most direct route, though this would take the fleet dangerously close to the shore, where there were many sandbars and reefs. Experienced crews sailed further out. ''Méduse'' was the fastest of the convoy and, disregarding his orders, Captain Chaumareys quickly lost contact with ''Loire'' and ''Argus''. ''Écho'' kept pace and attempted to guide ''Méduse'', but to no avail. ''Écho'' then prudently moved further out to sea.

Chaumareys had decided to involve one of the passengers, Richefort, in the navigation of the frigate. Richefort was a philosopher and a member of the Philanthropic Society of [[Cape Verde]], but had no qualification to guide ships.{{sfn|Snow|1979|p=64}} As she closed on the coast of Africa, the course of ''Méduse'' became dangerous. Richefort apparently mistook a large cloud bank on the horizon for [[Ras Nouadhibou|Cape Blanco]] on the African coast, and so underestimated the proximity of the [[Arguin Bank|Bank of Arguin]] off the coast of [[Mauritania]].{{sfn|Snow|1979|pp=65–66}}

On 2 July 1816, now more than {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} off course, ''Méduse'' ran into increasingly shallow water, with both Chaumareys and Richefort ignoring signs such as white breakers and mud in the water. Eventually, Lieutenant Maudet took it upon himself to start taking soundings off the bow, and, measuring only {{convert|18|fathom|m}}, warned his captain. Realising the danger at last, Chaumareys ordered the ship brought up into the wind, but it was too late, and ''Méduse'' ran aground {{convert|50|km|mi}} from the coast.{{sfn|Snow|1979|p=67}} The accident occurred at a spring [[high tide]], which made it difficult to re-float the frigate. The captain refused to jettison the 14 three-tonne cannons and so the ship settled into the bank.

===The raft===

[[File:Raft of Méduse-Alexandre Corréard-IMG 4788-cropped.JPG|thumb|250px|upright|''Plan du Radeau de la Méduse, au moment de son abandon'' ("Plan of the Raft of the Medusa at the moment of its abandonment"), frontispiece to ''Naufrage de la frégate Méduse''&lt;ref name="Darcy"&gt;Grigsby, Darcy Grimaldo. ''Extremities: Painting Empire in Post-Revolutionary France''. [[Yale University Press]], 2002. 177. {{ISBN|0-300-08887-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Alexandre Corréard]] and Jean-Baptiste Henri Savigny. Paris 1818, Bibliotheque Nationale.]]
The ''Méduse'' was not carrying enough [[ship's boats|lifeboats]] to transport all of the passengers to safety in a single trip. Plans were proposed to use the ship's [[launch (boat)|launches]] to ferry the passengers and crew to shore, just {{convert|50|km|mi}} away, which was expected to require at least two boat trips. Numerous ideas for lightening ''Méduse'' and immediately coming off the [[reef]] were also proposed, in particular that of building a raft on to which the crew could unload her cargo.&lt;ref name="leretabledemadmeg.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leretabledemadmeg.blogspot.com/2008/05/du-retable-la-machine.html|title=La MACHINE de MAD MEG: Le naufrage de la frégate La Méduse|first=|last=Dora|date=5 October 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2017}}

A raft measuring {{convert|20|m|ft}} long and {{convert|7|m|ft}} wide was soon constructed with wood salvaged from the wreck, and was nicknamed "''la Machine''" by the crew.&lt;ref name="leretabledemadmeg.blogspot.com"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2017}} On 5 July, a [[gale]] developed and ''Méduse'' showed signs of breaking up. The passengers and crew panicked, and Chaumareys decided to evacuate the frigate immediately, leaving no time to enact the original plan of making multiple ferry trips to shore. Instead, it was suggested that the raft could be used to carry passengers and ''Méduse''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s longboats could tow the raft to safety; 146 men and one woman boarded the woefully unstable raft. The raft had few supplies and no means of steering or navigation. Much of its deck was underwater. Seventeen men decided to stay with the disabled ''Méduse'', and the rest boarded the ship's longboats.{{sfn|Snow|1979|p=68}}

The crews of the boats soon realised that towing the raft was impractical and began to fear being overwhelmed by the desperate survivors aboard the raft. After traveling only a few kilometers, it was decided that the tow ropes should be cut, leaving the raft and its occupants to their fate.{{efn|According to some sources, Governor Schmaltz's boat was first to drop the tow line to the raft.}} The lifeboats, with the captain and Governor Schmaltz aboard, sailed away to safety. Some landed immediately on the coast of Africa, with most of the survivors making their way overland to Senegal, though some died on the way.

On the raft, the situation deteriorated rapidly. Among the provisions were casks of wine instead of water. Fights broke out between the officers and passengers on one hand, and the sailors and soldiers on the other. On the first night adrift, 20 men were killed or committed suicide. Stormy weather threatened, and only the center of the raft was secure. Dozens died either in fighting to get to the center or because they were washed overboard by the waves. Rations dwindled rapidly; by the fourth day there were only 67 people left alive on the raft, and some resorted to [[cannibalism]] to survive. On the eighth day, the fittest{{sfn|Savigny|Corréard|1818|p=118}} decided to throw the weak and wounded overboard, leaving just 15 men remaining, all of whom survived another four days until their rescue on 17 July by the brig ''Argus'', which accidentally encountered them.&lt;ref&gt;Riding, Christine: "The Raft of the Medusa in Britain", ''Crossing the Channel: British and French Painting in the Age of Romanticism'', page 75. Tate Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Snow|1979|pp=69–70}}

==Aftermath==

''Argus'' took the survivors of the raft to Saint-Louis to recover. Five of them, including Jean Charles, the last African crew member, died within days. Chaumareys decided to rescue the gold that was still on board ''Méduse'' and sent out a salvage crew, which discovered that the ''Méduse'' was still largely intact. Only three of the 17 men who had decided to stay on the ''Méduse'' were still alive 54 days later. British naval officers helped the survivors to return to France because aid from the French Minister of the Marine was not forthcoming.

''Méduse''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s surviving surgeon, Henri Savigny, and the governor's secretary submitted their account of the tragedy to the authorities. It was leaked to an anti-[[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] newspaper, the ''[[Journal des débats]]'', and was published on 13 September 1816. The incident quickly became a scandal in French politics and Bourbon officials tried to cover it up. At his [[court-martial]] at Port de Rochefort in 1817, Chaumareys was tried on five counts but acquitted of abandoning his squadron, of failing to re-float his ship and of abandoning the raft; however, he was found guilty of incompetent and complacent navigation and of abandoning the ''Méduse'' before all her passengers had been taken off. Even though this verdict exposed him to the death penalty, Chaumareys was sentenced to only three years in jail.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The court-martial was widely thought to be a "whitewash" and, in 1818, Senegal Governor Schmaltz was forced to resign. The [[Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr|Gouvion de Saint-Cyr]] Law later ensured that promotions in the French military would thereafter be based on merit.

Savigny and another survivor, the geographer-engineer [[Alexandre Corréard]], subsequently wrote a book with their own account (''Naufrage de la frégate la Méduse'') of the incident, published in 1817. It went through five editions by 1821 and was also published with success in English, German, Dutch and Italian translations. A revision of the text in later editions increased the political thrust of the work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article1543209.ece The Times], London, 24 March 2007, ''Death and the masterpiece''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2017}}

==Shipwreck site found==

In 1980, a French [[maritime archaeology|marine archaeological]] expedition led by Jean-Yves Blot located the ''Méduse'' shipwreck site off the coast of modern-day [[Mauritania]]. The team operated out of the port city of [[Nouadhibou]], approximately {{convert|160|km|mi}} north of the wreck site, and used four sailboats as the expedition's working vessels. The primary search tool was a one-of-a-kind [[magnetometer]] developed by the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|CEA]].

The search area was defined on the basis of the accounts of survivors of ''Méduse'' and, more importantly, on the records of an 1817 French coastal mapping expedition that found the vessel's remains still projecting above the waves. The background research proved to be so good that the expedition team located the shipwreck site on the very first day of searching. They then recovered enough artifacts to identify the wreck positively and to mount an exhibit in the Marine Museum in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Yves Blot, ''Chronique d'un Naufrage Ordinaire''&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

===Géricault's painting===

[[File:JEAN LOUIS THÉODORE GÉRICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|thumb|300px|''Le Radeau de la Méduse'' (1818–1819) by Théodore Géricault]]
{{Main|The Raft of the Medusa}}
Impressed by accounts of the shipwreck, the 25-year-old artist [[Théodore Géricault]] decided to create an oil painting based on the incident and contacted the writers in 1818. His work depicts a moment recounted by one of the survivors: prior to their rescue, the passengers saw a ship on the horizon, which they tried to signal. She disappeared, and in the words of one of the surviving crew members, "From the delirium of joy, we fell into profound despondency and grief".&lt;ref&gt;Riding, Christine, page 77, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship ''Argus'' reappeared two hours later and rescued those who remained. The painting, titled ''[[Le Radeau de la Méduse]]'' (English: ''The Raft of the Medusa''), is considered an iconic work of the French [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] and Géricault's masterpiece. It is on display in the [[Louvre]].

===Music===

* [[Friedrich von Flotow]] wrote the opera ''Le naufrage de la Méduse'' (1839), based on this sad case. 
*French songwriter and poet [[Georges Brassens]] alludes to the raft of ''Méduse'' in his song "Les copains d'abord" (1964). The song is a hymn to friendship, symbolised by the crew of a ship named "Les Copains d'Abord" ("Friends first"), and in the first verse it says that she was not "the raft of ''Méduse''".

===Literature===

*''Das Floß der Medusa'' (''The Raft of the Medusa''; 1940–1943), a play by German dramatist [[Georg Kaiser]]
*''Wreck of the Medusa'' by [[Alexander McKee (author)|Alexander McKee]], a narrative account of the final voyage, shipwreck and aftermath originally published in 1976 under the title ''[[Death Raft]]'' and reprinted in 2007. McKee draws upon multiple sources and provides analysis of the event in relation to similar maritime and aeronautical disasters.
*The untranslated second volume of [[Peter Weiss]]'s novel ''[[The Aesthetics of Resistance|Die Ästhetik des Widerstands]]'' (''The Aesthetics of Resistance''), originally published in 1978, opens with a detailed historical account of the ''Méduse'' and subsequently describes Géricault's painting
*In ''[[A History of the World in 10½ Chapters]]'' (1989) by [[Julian Barnes]], a semi-fictional work that attempts to deglaze and satirise popular historical legends, the chapter "Shipwreck" is devoted to analysis of the Géricault painting, with the first half narrating the incidents leading to the shipwreck and the survival of the crew members. The second half of the chapter renders a dark platonic and satirical analysis of the painting itself, and Géricault's "softening" the impact of crude reality in order to preserve the aestheticism of the work.
*''[[Ocean Sea (novel)|Ocean Sea]]'' (1993), a novel by [[Alessandro Baricco]]. The "second book" describes the event from the point of view of ''Méduse''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s surviving surgeon, Henri Savigny, and a sailor, both of them on the raft.

The captain's comment is the [[pun]], "Je suis médusé" ("I am dumbfounded").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9043">The '''Global Corruption Barometer''' published by [[Transparency International]] is the largest survey in the world tracking public opinion on corruption.&lt;ref name="transparency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|title=Global Corruption Barometer - 2013|publisher=transparency.org|accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It surveys 114,000 people in 107 countries on their view of corruption.

==Have you paid a bribe in 2013?==


People in 95 countries have been surveyed whether they have paid a bribe to a public body during the last year; for a small number of countries, including [[Brazil]] and [[Russia]], data on particular questions has been excluded because of concerns about validity and reliability. The margin of error for each country is 3%. The typical sample size is 1,000 people. Four countries – [[Cyprus]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Vanuatu]] and [[Solomon Islands]] – have a sample size of 500 people and a margin of error of 4%.

Unlike the other similar [[Corruption Perception Index]] published by Transparency International, this is a survey directly asking the population instead of using "perceived expert opinions", which is liable to substantial bias and has been under criticism as such. In a 2013 article in ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'', Alex Cobham argued that the CPI embeds a powerful and misleading elite bias in popular perceptions of corruption, potentially contributing to a vicious cycle and at the same time incentivizing inappropriate policy responses. Cobham resumes: "the index corrupts perceptions to the extent that it's hard to see a justification for its continuing publication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corrupting Perceptions|author=Cobham, Alex|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/07/22/corrupting_perceptions|journal=[[Foreign Policy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jersey Opera House''' is a working theatre and [[opera house]] in La [[Vingtaine de la Ville]], [[Saint Helier]], [[Jersey]], Channel Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jersey Opera House back in black |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/jersey/4412048.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=7 November 2005 |accessdate=2009-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre building is administered by the [[States of Jersey]] but is managed by Jersey Opera House Limited. The current theatre director is Jasmine Hendry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jersey Opera House quarrel settled as director replaced |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/15043/jersey-opera-house-quarrel-settled-as |work=[[The Stage]] |date=28 November 2006 |accessdate=2009-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current building is a 1922 reconstruction (by Jesty &amp; Baker) of the 1900 original building by Adolphus Curry (1848-1910), with additional extension facilities provided since. The façade has been described as "imposing and slightly Frenchified".&lt;ref&gt;''Buildings in the Town and Parish of Saint Helier'', Brett, [[National Trust for Jersey]] 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jersey's previous main theatre, the Theatre Royal in Royal Crescent, Saint Helier, burnt down on 31 July 1863. It took two years for a new theatre to be built: Henry Cornwall opened the Royal Amphitheatre in Gloucester Street on 17 April 1865. This theatre was sold to Wybert Rousby in 1869, and became known as the Theatre Royal, and later as the Theatre Royal and Opera House.

The Theatre Royal and Opera House was described in the Royal Almanac for 1890: "Its outside appearance has nothing specially attractive, but the interior is effectively decorated and decidedly comfortable (...) Open at frequent intervals throughout the year for the production of London and Parisian successes in comedy, drama, farce; also grand and comic opera rendered by specially organized companies." In the 1880s and 1890s prices were as follows: stalls seating for 2 shillings; dress circle seating for 3 shillings; pit seating for 1 shilling; gallery seating for 6 pence. 
[[File:Theatre Royal Jersey Patience 1882.jpg|thumb|left|In 1882 the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] performed ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' at the Theatre Royal]]
The theatre hosted a number of notable events. On 29 October 1885 the unveiling of the Don Monument in The Parade was the occasion for a gala performance. In April 1891 Lillie Langtry made her first appearance in a Jersey theatre at the Theatre Royal, followed by her attendance in September 1898 of a performance of R. C. Carton's "Lord and Lady Algy". A stage play of "The [[Battle of Jersey]]" was presented on 8 March 1899, with Wybert Rousby himself as [[Francis Peirson|Major Peirson]], concluding with a tableau reenactment of Copley's "[[The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781|The Death of Major Peirson]]" on stage. The Theatre Royal hosted circus performances for which the seats were moved from the auditorium onto the stage to permit the circus acts to perform in the body of the theatre.

Wybert Rousby sold the theatre to Sidney Cooper in 1898. Fire broke out in the night of 29 March 1899; flames were spotted at 2.30am. Police, firemen, a detachment of troops, and the actors then performing "Red Riding Hood", turned out to battle the fire, but at 3.10 am the roof crashed down, destroying the building. Neighbouring properties were also damaged.

The Channel Islands Entertainment Co. Ltd. built a new theatre on the ruins of the Theatre Royal and Opera House. The Opera House was opened by [[Lillie Langtry]] on 9 July 1900, who performed in the first play produced in the new premises, "The Degenerates". The new building was modern and spacious compared to its predecessor. The stage was 40 feet deep and 60 feet broad with overhead room of 54 feet, capable of receiving scenery from [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane, London]]. There were two boxes, one on each side of the stage, level with the dress circle: on the right "The Governor's Box" and on the left "The Bailiff's Box".&lt;ref name="Lemprière"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lemprière|first=Raoul|title=The Theatre in Jersey|newspaper=The Evening Post|date=10 December 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fire on 12 May 1921 partly destroyed the building.

In the 1920s the management started showing films, and this developed into a programme alternating cinema and live entertainment. When the Picture House, a cinema in Saint Helier, closed in April 1931, the Opera House became a cinema. It ran a regular cinema programme until the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|German Occupation]]. 
[[File:Demonstrations at Cinemas August 1941 Jersey.jpg|thumb|In 1941, the Opera House and other cinemas were threatened with closure by the Occupying authorities following public acts of resistance]]
When the Germans arrived, there were three cinemas in operation in Jersey: the Forum (opened 1935), the Opera House, and Wests (opened 1909). The Forum, as the largest cinema, was commandeered by the Germans for entertaining the troops. The two remaining cinemas had a mere 32 feature films in stock to last during the Occupation. The Opera House and Wests arranged an alternating programme between themselves, so that a week of cinema was followed by a week of stage performance and that when the Opera House was staging a play, Wests was showing a film, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Fifty Years of Films in Jersey'', ''[[Jersey Evening Post|Evening Post]]'', 30 January 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of providing entertainment and maintaining morale under the German Occupation was tackled by Jersey's amateur dramatic societies. By February 1941 a number of productions were nearing readiness but there was uncertainty as to which company would take the initiative. On 17 February the Opera House was reopened as a theatre with a production by the Green Room Club of "The Light of Heart" by [[Emlyn Williams]]. After that a new production was mounted monthly on average, interrupted by German requisitioning of the Opera House and other venues for their own purposes, such as a visit by German actress [[Lil Dagover]]. Times of curtain up varied according to the curfew imposed; on occasion when the population were collectively punished for acts of resistance by earlier curfews, the curtain had to rise as early as 6pm. The electricity supply became increasingly erratic. The Opera House was forced to resort to improvised lighting consisting of 3 car headlights in the orchestra pit and lights powered by car batteries in the wings.

In October 1943 a light opera "The Paladins", with libretto by Horace Wyatt and music by PG Larbalestier, was mounted. The German censor passed the text despite the inclusion of a chorus "Faithful and Free" that became an expression of patriotic longing that produced an emotional response in the audience.

In July 1943 the Opera House and other cinemas were ordered to be closed for a month, and again following [[D-Day]] on 6 June 1944 until 9 August 1944. When the electricity supply ended on 25 January 1945, performances at the Opera House ended. Immediately following Liberation on 9 May 1945, the Opera House reopened for a grand variety show on 10 May 1945 for released prisoners.&lt;ref name=Occupation&gt;{{cite news|title=The Story of "Occupation Theatre"|newspaper=The Evening Post|date=18 November 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opera House resumed its operation as a cinema after the Liberation, but closed as a cinema in 1959, reverting to a stage theatre.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1953 the theatre was purchased by Odeon (Jersey) Ltd. who ran it as a cinema with the exception of the staging of a musical show "Starlight Rendezvous" in 1955 and 1956. Odeon (Jersey) Ltd. put the Opera House on the market with a condition of sale that no films were to be shown under the new ownership. Theatrical impresario Tommy Swanson negotiated with the ultimate owners [[Rank Organisation]] for eighteen months before concluding the purchase at the end of the 1959 summer season. He undertook major renovations, adding 15 extra boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Evening Post 1890-1965|year=1965|publisher=The Evening Post|location=Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building came into the ownership of Dick Ray from 1976 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/6746|title=Jersey Opera House rejects Ray’s rescue |last=Smith|first=  Alistair |work=The Stage| date=3 March 2005 |accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the public of the Island of Jersey became the new owner of the Jersey Opera House at a cost of £1.3 million. In January 1997 the theatre closed for a major restoration project. A proposition was presented to the States of Jersey for a loan of £5.5 million to add to the £1.5 million that had been raised by the good will of the people and businesses of Jersey. This was successful and this major programme of work started in August 1998. After an extensive programme of rebuilding and renovation the new theatre opened its door on 9 July 2000 exactly 100 years to the day when the first Opera House had opened its doors to the public of Jersey.

The Jersey Opera House has had some financial difficulties in the past as well as periods when it did not operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/5684|title= Jersey Opera House directors all resign|last= Smith|first=Alistair |date= 17 December 2004|work=The Stage|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/6514|title=Jersey Opera House dark again|date=15 February 2005 |last=Smith|first=  Alistair |work=The Stage|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kentucky Apple Festival''' is an annual [[festival]] held in [[Paintsville, Kentucky|Paintsville]], [[Kentucky]] during the first Friday and Saturday in October. The festival was originally created in 1962 as a way to provide a market for the county's [[apple]] production.&lt;ref name=festival&gt;{{cite book |author=Shermanski, Frances |title=''A Guide to Fairs and Festivals in the United States'' |year=1984 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |location=[[Santa Barbara, California]] |isbn=0-313-21437-9 |chapter=}} Retrieved on 2010-09-04&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first Kentucky Apple Festival was held on October 6, 1962, and was known as "Apple Day". It was guided by Elmon Davis, an officer at [[Citizens National Bank (Eastern Kentucky)|Citizens National Bank]] and apple orchard owner from [[Flat Gap, Kentucky|Flat Gap]]. Davis not only created the festival to promote the county's apple production, but to compete with the Johnson County Fair, which had been held annually since 1914. Eventually, the Kentucky Apple Festival became the more popular of the two and the Johnson County Fair became nonexistent.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite book |author=Johnson County Historical Society |title=''Johnson County, Kentucky:History and Families'' |year=2001 |publisher=Turner Publishing Company |location=[[Nashville, Tennessee]] |isbn=1-56311-756-8 |chapter=}} Retrieved on 2010-09-04&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==

Although the majority of the festivities occur on the first Friday and Saturday in October, many events occur during the last week of September, adding up to over forty-five events. Traditional events include: Junior and Miss Apple Blossom pageant; school competitions in spelling, art, penmanship, and mathematics; old-fashion costume contest; [[diamondback terrapin|terrapin]] trot (turtle race); multiple concerts; car shows; Ducky Derby ([[Rubber duck]] race on [[Paint Creek (Johnson County, Kentucky)|Paint Creek]]) and the Apple Festival Parade.&lt;ref name=official&gt;[http://www.kyapplefest.org/ Kentucky Apple Festival] Official website. Retrieved on 2014-05-10&lt;/ref&gt; One of the festival's largest and most popular events prior to 2009 was the Apple Bowl. The annual football game between [[Paintsville High School]] and [[Johnson Central High School]] was halted after 2008 due to the difference in the size of the two schools.

'''Legal abuse''' refers to [[abuses]] associated with both [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[Criminal law|criminal]] legal action.  Abuse can originate from nearly any part of the legal system, including [[frivolous litigation|frivolous]] and [[vexatious litigation|vexatious]] [[litigants]], [[police misconduct|abuses by law enforcement]], [[legal malpractice|incompetent, careless or corrupt attorneys]] and [[judicial misconduct|misconduct from the judiciary]] itself.&lt;ref name="r_chance"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Chance |first1= Randal P.|title= RAPED by the STATE: Fractured Justice - Legal Abuse|year= 2004 |publisher= AuthorHouse |isbn= 978-1-4140-5005-8 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=IjZu6sM4r6EC&amp;pg=PA463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="r_colombo"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Colombo | first1= R. | title= Fight Back Legal Abuse: How to Protect Yourself From Your Own Attorney | year= 2010 | publisher= Morgan James Publishing | isbn= 978-1-60037-709-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal abuse is responsible not only for [[injustice]], but also harm to [[Health|physical]], [[mental health|psychological]] and [[society|societal]] health.*&lt;ref name="huffer_02"&gt;{{cite book | last1= Huffer | first1= Karin | title= Legal Abuse Syndrome | date= June 1995 | publisher= Karin Huffer | isbn= 0-9641786-0-5 | url= http://www.judicialaccountability.org/legalabuse.htm | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726212148/http://www.judicialaccountability.org/legalabuse.htm | archivedate= 2011-07-26 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Abuses can originate from virtually every part of the legal system. [[Litigants]], [[Attorney at law|attorneys]], [[law enforcement]] and [[judiciary]] can abuse the system, sometimes accidentally but more often intentionally. Legal abuse can also be [[Structural abuse|systemic]], such as when the principles, processes, and consequences of law itself encourage and enable individuals to legally harm others.

===Abusive litigants===
{{main|Vexatious litigation|Frivolous litigation|Strategic lawsuit against public participation|Frameup}}
Abusive litigants in [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] are most often classified as vexatious litigation, frivolous litigation, or both.  A ''vexatious litigant'' seeks to [[harass]] or subdue an adversary.  A ''frivolous litigant'' starts or carries on actions that have little or no merit and are very unlikely to be won.  Litigants of this sort are often unable to find [[advocate|representation]] willing to accommodate them and thus must represent themselves [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|in propria persona]].

There can often be considerable overlap between these two types of abuse.  One case in point is the ''strategic lawsuit against public participation'' (SLAPP), which is a lawsuit intended to censor, [[intimidate]] and silence critics by fear, intimidation and burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition. Such actions are self-evidently vexatious, but are typically frivolous as well in that the plaintiff does not expect, or even intend, to win.

Litigants can abuse the system in [[criminal]] ways as well.  Some of the forms of criminal legal system abuse are [[jury tampering]], the practice of directing enticements or threats to jurors in order to influence their deliberations, and [[Falsified evidence|falsification of evidence]], which refers to any of a variety of ways [[evidence]] is improperly manipulated. One particular case of falsifying evidence is the ''frameup'', a chiefly American term for the manufacture or manipulation of evidence for the purpose of indicating the guilt of an innocent party.

===Law enforcement abuse===
{{main|Police misconduct}}
There are a plethora of ways that [[law enforcement|police and law enforcement]] can undermine the [[rights]] of citizens.  Sometimes such abuses are unintentional, brought about by circumstance, imperfect understanding of some subtlety of law, or other kinds of [[good-faith]] mistakes.  In other cases rights are abused deliberately, due to [[prejudice]], self-interest, [[vigilante|vigilantism]], impaired [[value judgment]], [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] or [[corruption]].  Such [[police misconduct]] can take many forms, among them [[false arrest]], [[harassment]], [[police brutality]], [[falsification of evidence]], [[coercion]] and in rare cases, [[torture]] and [[false imprisonment]].

===Abusive advocates===
{{main|Attorney misconduct}}
[[Lawyers]], [[paralegals]] and other professionals involved in legal advocacy can abuse the system in a number of ways.  In some cases, representation may be well-intended but nonetheless incompetent.  In others, lawyers engage in [[attorney misconduct|misconduct]] in an effort to gain unfair advantage for their clients or in pursuit of some [[Ethical egoism|self-interest]].&lt;ref name="r_colombo"/&gt;

===Abusive judiciary===
{{main|Judicial misconduct}}
Abuse from the [[bench (law)|bench]] can arise from various causes, including incompetence, [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]], [[impartiality|bias or prejudice]], judicial misconduct and [[Judicial corruption|corruption]].

==Consequences of abuse==
Although the primary consequence of unaddressed legal-system abuse for victims is [[injustice]], abuses of the legal system inflict harm in many other ways.  [[Civil law (common law)|Civil litigation]] and [[criminal defense]] of the innocent impose [[Chronic stress|psychological stress]], often severe, upon the parties involved.  Often such stress will affect [[health|physical health]] as well.  When the system is abused and justice is denied as a result, stress and its effects can be exacerbated enormously.&lt;ref name="r_chance"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2013}} [[Karin P. Huffer]], M.S., M.F.T. hypothesized the condition Legal Abuse Syndrome (LAS) as a form of [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) caused by ethical violation, legal abuse, [[betrayal]], [[abuse of power]], [[abuse of authority]], lack of accountability and [[fraud]].&lt;ref name="huffer_02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffer_01"&gt;{{cite book| last1= Huffer | first1= Karin | title= Overcoming the Devastation of Legal Abuse Syndrome | year= 1995 | publisher= Karin Huffer | isbn= 978-0-9641786-0-1 | url= http://www.child-abuses.com/legal-abuse/legal-definition-abuse.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic and [[wiktionary:high-profile|high-profile]] legal abuse have [[society|societal]] effects as well, including distrust of the law, law enforcement and the legal system, [[rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]] of small crimes by ordinarily honest citizens, and psychological stress.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

"'''Locked Up'''" is the debut single by American singer [[Akon]], taken as the lead single from his album, ''[[Trouble (Akon album)|Trouble]]''. The single was released in 2004, peaking at #8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. Outside the United States, "Locked Up" peaked within the top 10 of the charts in the Republic of Ireland and the UK.

==Background==
Although it was widely regarded that "[[Lonely (Akon song)|Lonely]]" offered the album's best option in terms of commercial breakthrough and lead single as well as 1st single, [[SRC Records|SRC]] A&amp;R and producer [[Knobody]] chose "Locked Up" as the 1st and lead single because he wanted to break Akon in the streets 1st, and then cross-over. In an interview for [[HitQuarters]], he claimed: "Locked Up" is a street record. I thought that was the place for us to start to get a fan-base, knowing that weight. We thought really carefully about the record, what touches people and will get people's attention – so we added references of his kin and kith sending him magazines, money-orders, to visit him, ask where his lawyer is, accept his phone calls and ask "where're my niggaz on lockdown." The song was designed a breakout hit for Akon, something that could shape the future of his personal life and widely successful musical career. I worked on what I call "drops" – points in the record where it feels different, to break the monotony and make it a little more interesting."&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JeromeFoster.html |title=Interview With Knobody |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=Sep 27, 2005 |accessdate=Jul 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knobody produced an alternate of the song, featuring [[Styles P]], which appears as both a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] on the single and as a bonus track on the UK version of the album. In 2004, [[T-Pain]] sampled the song in a parody recording "I'm Fucked Up", which became a main factor in him getting signed to [[Konvict Kartel]]. In 2005, the song was sampled in the track "Won't Let Me Out" by [[C-Murder]]. A music video was produced to promote the single. The video was directed by FlyyKai, and was edited to both the album version and the remix featuring Styles P. The French CD single also has a remix featuring [[French hip hop|French rapper]] [[Booba]], which is also Akon's favorite "Locked Up" remix&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dhnet.be/medias/musique/je-represente-le-senegal-aux-etats-unis-51b7c599e4b0de6db98d276f|title=«Je représente le Sénégal aux Etats-Unis»|last=DH.be|first=|date=|work=DH.be|access-date=2017-10-19|language=fr|quote=Ma version préférée est celle avec Booba. (My favorite version is the one with Booba)}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Another remix featuring Styles and British rapper Taz was included on the UK version of Trouble.

[[File:Karen Price reconstruction.gif|thumb|Comparison of a clay reconstruction of Karen Price's skull with a photograph of Price.]]
'''Karen Price''' (known posthumously as '''Little Miss Nobody''') was a 15-year-old [[Welsh people|Welsh]] murder victim who disappeared in 1981. After the discovery of her body in 1989, British facial reconstruction artist [[Richard Neave]] used her skull to create a model of her physical appearance.&lt;ref name="swpm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Every Contact Leaves a Trace – A History of Fingerprinting|work=[[South Wales Police|South Wales Police Museum]]|url=http://www.southwalespolicemuseum.org.uk/en/content/cms/history_of_the_force/history_of_fingerpri/history_of_fingerpri.aspx|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstruction and the matching of [[DNA]] in the body to that of Price's parents allowed her body to be identified. The case was cited as one of the first instances in which DNA technology was used in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pathologist Bernard Knight to stop crime writing|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8571689.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|date=17 March 2010|accessdate=20 June 2015|first=Neil|last=Prior}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and identification==
In 1989, in [[Cardiff|Cardiff, Wales]], two construction workers unearthed a rolled carpet while installing a garden behind a house. When the carpet was unrolled, the skeletal remains of a young female were revealed. [[Entomology|Entomologists]] studied insect eggs around the discovery site and determined that the girl had been dead for approximately 10 years. When early efforts to identify the body failed, Richard Neave of [[Manchester University]] created a clay [[forensic facial reconstruction|facial reconstruction]] of the skull. This reconstruction, along with a comparison of DNA samples from the victim and Price's parents, made the identification possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Gene Genius|work=[[University of Leicester]]|date=2004|accessdate=20 June 2015|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ua/pr/gen%20supp.pdf|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Sam|title=Professor Bernard Knight, the pathologist turned novelist|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2010/03/17/professor-bernard-knight-the-pathologist-turned-novelist-91466-26047151/|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|location=Cardiff|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police concluded that Price had run away from home and turned to [[prostitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Maggots, Murder, and Men: Memories and Reflections of a Forensic Entomologist|last = Erzinçlioglu|first = Zakaria|publisher = Macmillan|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Idris Ali and Alan Charlton, who were alleged to have managed her solicitation as a prostitute, were charged with her [[murder]].&lt;ref name=swpm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Book of Man: The Human Genome Project and the Quest to Discover Our Genetic Heritage|last = Bodmer|first = Walter Fred|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 191|last2 = McKie|first2 = Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali's charge was eventually reduced to [[manslaughter]], and he was released in 1994. Charlton is still serving a life sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=James|first=David|date=13 July 2010|title=Public warned to stay away from violent thug|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|location=Cardiff|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2010/07/13/public-warned-to-stay-away-from-violent-thug-91466-26839018/|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Review of convictions==
In February 2014, the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]], the public body responsible for investigating alleged [[Miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]] in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, referred Charlton's conviction to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], stating that there was a "real possibility" that the conviction could be overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=27 February 2014|title=Teenager's Killer Has Conviction Referred|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|location=Cardiff|first=Martin|last=Shipton|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-360027219.html|accessdate=20 June 2015|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, the commission also referred Ali's conviction to the appeal court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teenager's Killer Has Conviction Referred|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|location=Cardiff|date=14 March 2015|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-405121967.html|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating, "There is a real possibility the Court of Appeal will conclude that the conviction is unsafe because of the risk of the prosecution amounting to an abuse of process".&lt;ref name="ccrc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Commission refers the manslaughter conviction of Idris Ali to the Court of Appeal|date=13 March 2015|work=[[Criminal Cases Review Commission]]|url=http://www.ccrc.gov.uk/commission-refers-the-manslaughter-conviction-of-idris-ali-to-the-court-of-appeal/|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was disclosed that a number of officers from the [[South Wales Police]] who were involved in the investigation of Price's murder had also worked on the [[Murder of Lynette White|Lynette White]] and [[Cardiff Newsagent Three|Philip Saunders murder inquiries]], in which six men were wrongfully convicted.&lt;ref name=ccrc/&gt; Other sources of concern in the Price case, according to the commission, included breaches of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] (PACE) and the PACE Code of Practice, which govern the detention, treatment, and questioning of persons by police officers; the credibility of the prosecution witnesses; "oppressive handling by the police of key witnesses"; and the "veracity of Mr. Ali's guilty plea".&lt;ref name=ccrc/&gt;

In 2016 both men's appeals were dismissed at the Court of Appeal in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardiff Body in Carpet Killing: Men Fail in Appeal Bid |date=8 March 2016 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-wales-south-east-wales-35753652 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GRB080319B illustration NASA.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gamma-ray bursts might have regulated the advent of intelligent life]]
'''Neocatastrophism''' is the [[hypothesis]] that life-exterminating events such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s have acted as a galactic regulation mechanism in the [[Milky Way]] upon the emergence of complex [[life]] in its [[Galactic habitable zone|habitable zone]].&lt;ref name="Cirković08"&gt;Cirković MM, Vukotić B.

[http://www.aob.bg.ac.rs/paob/86/pdf/193-196.pdf Astrobiological Landscape and Neocatastrophism.]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Publications of the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade,86:193-19&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed as an explanation of [[Fermi paradox|Fermi's paradox]]  since it provides a mechanism which would have delayed the otherwise expected advent of [[Noogenesis|intelligent being]]s in the local galaxy nearby to [[Earth]]. This is an avenue to explain why none so far have been detected by [[humans]].

==The problem==

It is estimated that Earth-like [[planet]]s in the Milky Way started forming 9 billion years ago, and that their [[median]] age is 6.4 ± 0.7 [[Ga (unit)|Ga]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver C.H. (2001). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0012399v2 An Estimate of the Age Distribution of Terrestrial Planets in the Universe: Quantifying Metallicity as a Selection Effect.] Icarus, 151:307-313 {{doi|10.1006/icar.2001.6607}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, 75% of stars in the [[galactic habitable zone]] are older than the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver CH, Fenner Y, Gibson BK. (2004). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401024 The galactic habitable zone and the age distribution of complex life in the Milky Way.] Science. 303(5654):59-62. {{DOI|10.1126/science.1092322}} {{PMID|14704421}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the existence of potential planets with evolved intelligent life more likely than not to be older than that of the Earth ([[Age of the Earth|4.54 Ga]]). This creates an observational dilemma since [[interstellar travel]], (even of the "slow" kind that is nearly within the reach of present Earth technology) could in theory, if this had arisen elsewhere, take from only 5 million to 50 million years to colonize the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, I.A., [http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf "Where are They? Maybe we are alone in the galaxy after all"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326090244/http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}, '' Scientific American,'' July 2000, 38-43, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a conundrum first posed in 1950 by the physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] in his namesake paradox: "Why are no aliens or their artifacts physically here?"&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"&gt;Webb S. (2002). ''If the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody? Fifty solutions to the Fermi paradox and the problem of extraterrestrial life''. Copernicus Books (Springer Verlag)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The neocatastrophism resolution==
The hypothesis posits that [[Astrobiology|astrobiological evolution]] is subject to regulation mechanisms that arrest or postpone the advent of complex creatures capable of interstellar communication and traveling technology. These regulation mechanisms act to temporarily sterilize planets of biology in the [[galactic habitable zone]]. The main proposed regulation mechanism is gamma-ray bursts.&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt;

Part of the neocatastrophism hypothesis is that [[stellar evolution]] produces a decreasing frequency of such catastrophic events increasing the length of the "window" in which intelligent life might arise as galaxies age. According to modeling,&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt; this creates the possibility of a [[phase transition]] at which point a galaxy turns from a place that is essentially dead (with a few pockets of simple life) to one that is crowded with complex life forms.

'''Netmage'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netmage.it/ Netmage]&lt;/ref&gt; is an international festival dedicated to electronic art curated by Xing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xing.it/ XING]&lt;/ref&gt;  and produced annually—in the city of [[Bologna]]—as a multidisciplinary program of works, investigating and promoting contemporary audiovisual research. The festival was born in 2000 with funds provided by the [[European Union]], when Bologna represented one of the nine major [[European capital of culture]]. The festival concentrates on an amalgam of Happenings, environments, and audio/visual installations, it does through a concentration on creative scenes&lt;ref&gt;[http://arted.osu.edu/publications/pdf_files/paper38.pdf The creative Scene in Milano] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704051720/http://arted.osu.edu/publications/pdf_files/paper38.pdf |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subcultural communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/squealer/butchhome/Ch_Scene/ch_scene_communication.htm CH-Scene: Communication Theories and Musical Communities by Butch Lazorchak]&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of Netmage (eleven editions from 2001 to 2011) was merged into the annual [[Live Arts Week]].

==Mission==
The mission of Netmage is to  investigate the relationship between the  "liveness" and the "ambient space".
At the crossroads of these two terms is situated the notion of "post-cinema": defined as an environmental construction capable of gathering widely diverse attitudes in a public space.
&lt;ref name="popularFilm"&gt;{{cite book |title=Memory and Popular Film: Inside Popular Film|  first="Jeffrey"| last="Pence"  |editor="Paul Grainge"|publisher="Manchester UP"|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Post Cinema/Postmemory It is a cinema made of multi-projections on a number of screens with no seating, a multiplication of narrative traces, possible points of view, physical positions of the spectators; achieving a removal of the forced estrangement of the 20th Century spectator (the darkness of the room, physical and perceptive isolation, a monodirectional viewing perspective) that evoke the world of the first [[Happenings]] of the 1960s, the philosophy of [[expanded cinema]], and successive multimedia installation experiments of the 1980s.

=="Live Media"==

"[[Live Media]] is an open-ended term which has come into currency amongst artists and theoreticians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_topics/v011/11.2saltz.html Live Media: Interactive Technology and Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://crca.ucsd.edu/views.php?id=6 Live Media Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Live-media relates to the gathering of relatively diverse practices capable of calling to mind the wide range of research by video producers, visual artists, musicians, sound artists, VJ's, filmmakers, designers and a range of creative people issued by creative scenes and subcultural communities.
Netmage and its curators have been instrumental in coining and promoting this term.

* utilization of electronic, digital or analogue platforms to generate images and sound;
* interaction consisting of visual and audio elements;
* inclusion of liveness (or randomness) as in any kind of performance.

Playing with stimuli, what is created in the live-media experience is a "privilege of variation" that in the first case goes from designer to public, in the second from public to executor. The confrontation is direct, dictated by the logic of the event.

"Dispositif" (post-cinema)&lt;ref name="popularFilm"/&gt; and practice (Live Media) thus represent two types of continuous variation through which Netmage questions possible currents in new media aesthetics, summoning artists and visual operators from diverse disciplines, in a context reminiscent of the [[Happening]].

Despite the complexity born from the exploration of this kind of space, ideal internal space, the  two axes—post-cinema and live media—intertwine and simply state what may be called a gathering, a togetherness of the community of producers, protagonists in the field of contemporary media, who both find themselves isolated; creating then a direct, interdisciplinary confrontation, thus filling a growing gap between hyper-connectivity on one hand, physical and social experience on the other.

==History==
The first edition of the festival was born in an historic watershed with a view on one side from the experiences of one of the last bastions of the Twentieth Century [[avantgarde]], [[video art]], and on the other toward a new front that was as yet undefined while the entire world of research visual production was poised to turn fully digital.

In the field of music, the 1990s had already anticipated a great deal of what was later to come in the visual world, pointing the way to a radical transformation in techniques, languages and methods of cultural consumption. Netmage, different from a number of other festivals dedicated to electronics born in the world of [[nightclub|clubbing]], has concentrated on the production of images, imagination and universal vision.
In eleven editions Netmage has produced and hosted over two hundred projects from over thirty countries (including Europe, Asia, The Americas, Oceania) offering a smattering of the most recent evolutions in the technological imagination and multiple currents.

The '''Orlando Film Festival''' is an annual [[film festival]] held in [[Orlando, Florida]]. It has become one of the premier film festivals for [[independent film|independent]] filmmakers to showcase their work. Heading into its 11th year, the Orlando Film Festival attracts upwards of 1000 entries from filmmakers in more than 30 countries every year.

==History==
Created as an alternative to commercial cinema, the annual week-long festival remains true to its original goal of promoting film as an art form. Its mission is to support and promote culture and the arts in Downtown Orlando through the medium of film. The Orlando Film Festival seeks to inspire student, future and current filmmakers in the art of [[filmmaking]], and to enhance the movie viewing experience in Downtown Orlando through creative, unique and entertaining events.

'''Owen John Baggett''' (August 29, 1920 – July 27, 2006)&lt;ref name="San Antonio EN"&gt;{{cite news|title=Owen John Baggett|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sanantonio/obituary.aspx?n=owen-john-baggett&amp;pid=88867663#fbLoggedOut|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=San Antonio Express-News|date=30 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a second lieutenant in the [[United States]] 7th Bomb Group based at [[Pandaveswar]], in [[India]], during the [[Second World War]].

Baggett was born in [[Graham, Texas]] in 1920.&lt;ref name="San Antonio EN" /&gt; He graduated from [[Hardin–Simmons University]] in 1941, where he was the band's drum major.&lt;ref name="San Antonio EN" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bethel&gt;{{cite web|last=Bethel|first=Brian|title=Owen Baggett, 85: friend of many, good drummer, one heck of a WWII tale|url=http://www.reporternews.com/news/2006/jul/29/owen-baggett-85-friend-of-many-good-drummer-one/|work=|publisher=[[Abilene Reporter-News]]|accessdate=19 August 2012|date=29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hayes&gt;{{cite news|editor=Hayes, Harry H.|title=Owen Baggett Missing In Action|accessdate=20 August 2012|newspaper=Hardin-Simmons University Bulletin|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth116776/m1/1/|date=April 1943|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite journal|title=A War, A Legend, and Forgiveness|journal=Range Rider|date=April 2007|pages=50–51|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth117124/|editor1-first=Jones|editor1-last=Britt Yates|publisher=Hardin-Simmons University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610194859/http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth117124/|archivedate=2015-06-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found employment on [[Wall Street]] after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keeping Up With the Exs|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth116758/ |accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=Hardin-Simmons University Bulletin|date=August 1941|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
Baggett enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] (which was subsumed by the [[Army Air Forces]] in February 1942) and graduated from pilot training on July 26, 1942, at the New Columbus Army Flying School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keeping Up With the Exs|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth116770/|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=Hardin-Simmons University Bulletin|date=October 1942|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 1943, while stationed in British India, Baggett's [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]], part of the [[7th Bombardment Group]], was ordered to destroy a bridge at [[Pyinmana]], [[Burma]].&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt; Before reaching their target, the 12 [[B-24]]s of 7th BG were intercepted by 13 [[Ki-43]] fighters of ''64 Sentai'' [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|IJAAS]].&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; Baggett's plane was severely damaged and was set on fire by several hits to the fuel tanks, and the crew was forced to bail out. The aircrew escaped the crippled B-24 merely seconds before the bomber exploded. Japanese pilots then [[Attacks on parachutists|attacked U.S. airmen as they parachuted to earth]]. Two of Baggett's fellow crew members were killed. (Contrary to sources stating that the pilot, Lloyd K. Jensen was "summarily executed", Jensen survived the war.&lt;ref&gt;The sources regarding Lloyd K. Jensen include Baggett's own statements in the book ''Guests of the Emperor (p. 187) and the National Archives and Records Administration, ''World War II Prisoners of War Data File, 12/7/1941 - 11/19/1946''.&lt;/ref&gt;)  Baggett, who was wounded, played dead, hoping that the Japanese pilots would ignore him. One [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zero]] fighter approached close to Baggett, slowed and the pilot  opened his [[aircraft canopy|canopy]]. Baggett drew his [[M1911 pistol]], fired four shots at the pilot and watched as the plane stalled and plunged toward the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Leroy|title=The Colt 1911 Pistol|year=2011|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1849084335|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pictorial history of the 7th Bombardment Group/Wing, 1918-1995|year=1998|publisher=7th Bombardment Group(H) Historical Foundation|isbn=096604620X|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Andy|title=Magellan And I|year=2004|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=1418496456|pages=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Baggett later achieved fame as the only person to shoot down an aircraft with a pistol,&lt;ref name="San Antonio EN" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frisbee |first1=John L. |last2= |first2= |year=1966 |title=Valor: David and Goliath |journal=Air Force Magazine |volume=79 |issue=7 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/1996/July%201996/0796valor.aspx |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The M1911 Gets a Zero|url=http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/m1911-gets-a-zero/|work=The American Rifleman|publisher=National Rifle Association|accessdate=19 August 2012|date=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Robert K.|title=Gun Digest Shooters Guide to the 1911|year=2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|isbn=1440218943|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dltfyqFaA68C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Gun+Digest+Shooters+Guide+to+the+1911&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7KalIVDJB-&amp;sig=lIQhWokhL6sGVY92Zu-rpmocIr4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oDYyUNf-M-L9igLC8IDABw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Baggett&amp;f=false|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was contradicted by Japanese wartime records,&lt;ref name="young"&gt;Edward M.

Baggett survived the descent and was captured by Japanese ground forces. He remained a prisoner for the rest of the war.&lt;ref name="San Antonio EN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourjaily|first=Phil|title=Best Shot with a 1911.

While he was assigned to [[Mitchel Air Force Base]], Baggett was noted for his work with children, including sponsoring a boy and a girl to be commander for a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Army, Navy, Air Force Journal|year=1953|volume=91|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baggett retired from the Air Force as a colonel and later worked as a defense contractor manager for [[Litton Industries|Litton]].&lt;ref name=Bethel /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Missiles and Rockets, Vol. 14|year=1964|publisher=American Aviation Publications|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Program''' is a German non-profit platform that aims to expand the disciplinary boundaries of [[architecture]] through its collaboration with other fields. Based in [[Berlin]], it was founded in 2006 by Carson Chan (born 1980 in [[Hong Kong]]) and Fotini Lazaridou-Hatzigoga (born 1979 in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]]). Program has been providing a discursive platform for artists, architects, critics and curators to explore new ideas through exhibitions, performances, workshops, lectures and residencies. Exhibitions represent a large part of Program's mandate for expanding the current understanding of architecture, both theoretically and in practice.

[[File:Sail amsterdam 05 crowds.jpg|{{largethumb}}|SAIL Amsterdam in 2005]]

'''SAIL Amsterdam''' is a quinquennial [[sea|maritime]] event in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. [[Tall ship]]s from all over the world visit the city to moor in its eastern harbour, and people can then visit the ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sail.nl/en-2015|title=SAIL Amsterdam 2015 - Official website|website=www.sail.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Amsterdam Sail 2010 0819 Stad Amsterdam 02.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Stad Amsterdam]]'', the flagship of SAIL Amsterdam 2010]]
The event was organised for the first time in 1975 to celebrate the 700th anniversary of Amsterdam, under the name 'Sail Amsterdam 700'. At that time, interest in tall ships, which had sunk to a low since the 1930s when the last commercial tall ships had been built, was starting to rise.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The success of Sail Amsterdam 700 led to the establishment of the ''Stichting Sail Amsterdam'' (SSA, ''Foundation Sail Amsterdam'').

Sail is one of the largest maritime manifestations in the world, and the largest event of any kind in the Netherlands. Tens of tall ships and hundreds of other historical ships are involved. Numerous other ships and boats are present besides the participating ships, amounting to 8000 boats in the 2000 edition.

Lesser events take place during the festival, involving small sailboats, sailor choirs or re-enactments of naval battles. The ''Sail In'' or ''Parade of Sail'' on the first day attracts many other small ships, including creations like a sailing organ (with trumpet accompaniment) or a train converted to a ship.

SAIL Amsterdam 2005 was held from 17 to 22 August, the 7th edition of the festival. The event was expected to attract 2 to 3 million visitors. The number of tall ships depends on the definition, but figures vary from 21 (the official figure) to over 50 (those with at least 3 masts). Other historical ships number around 600. There were also several [[ship replica]]s (either real sailing ships or fakes that have to be towed), hundreds of classical sail- and steamships ('het [[Nationaal Varend Erfgoed]]' - the Sailing National Heritage) and some modern marine ships. New that year were several modern yachts and a submarine, the ''{{ill|Hr Ms Zeeleeuw|nl|Zr.Ms. Zeeleeuw (1990)}}''.

The tall ships were moored in the [[IJhaven]] (IJ harbour) and in Amsterdam North (across [[IJ (Amsterdam)|'t IJ]]) and the Varend Erfgoed boats were moored in the {{ill|Oosterdok|nl}} nearby, where one can also find the [[Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum]] (a [[maritime museum]]) with its (fake) replica of a [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) ship, which is permanently moored there. Absent was another Dutch replica of a VOC ship (a 'real' [[seaworthy]] replica), the [[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]], with its home port in [[Lelystad]], not too far from Amsterdam.

[[File:pieremachochel version of Prins Willem.jpg|thumb|A so-called 'Pieremachochel', the [[Prins Willem (ship replica)|''Prins Willem'']]]]

Smaller events included an exposition of yacht building in the newly built [[Muziekgebouw]] ('music building'), many music stages, food from all corners of the Earth, fireworks every night at 10 o'clock, a parade of sailors in uniform and the 'Pieremachocheltocht' (even the organisation isn't sure what the word means), a parade of carnavalesque floating creations (open to anyone).

Costs of the event were around €7.5 million. Direct financial benefits are from sponsoring, catering and sales of souvenirs.

This year's three themes were the maritime link between past, present and future, the connection of worlds and cultures and youth, with the binding motto 'Enjoy a world of friendships' (in English - the pun doesn't work in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]).

On the first day, the ships gather in the [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] at [[IJmuiden]] for the ''Sail In'' or ''Parade of Sail'' through the [[North Sea Canal]] to Amsterdam, led by the event's flagship. In 2005 that was the ''Stad Amsterdam'', which was supposed to reach Amsterdam first, but she ran aground (allegedly the fact that the Dutch crown prince [[Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange|Willem Alexander]] was at the helm had nothing to do with that), so the Statsraad Lehmkuhl came in first (it's not a contest, though). Amsterdam's harbour is known to be very shallow (a centuries-old problem) and the Stad Amsterdam is a 'deep' ship. But luckily the ground is also very soggy, so there is not likely to have been any damage.

In 2005, {{ill|Sail Bremerhaven|de}} was held one week before SAIL Amsterdam (10–14 August) and it was decided to make that a five-yearly event as well, which will be convenient for the ships since they are already in the neighbourhood.

SAIL Amsterdam 2005 logo contest was won by Lamouri Merouane. A former student of a design school in [[Amsterdam]] (Grafisch Lyceum Amsterdam) He is originally from [[Algeria]] (Algiers). His logo was finally chosen and used through the entire event.

[[Image:Shoe tossing in Vitoria-Gasteiz (2013) 2.jpg|thumb|Shoe tossing in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]], [[Spain]] (2013).]]
'''Shoe tossing''', the act of using shoes as [[projectile]]s or improvised  [[weapon]]s, is a constituent of a number of [[folklore|folk]] [[sport]]s and practices. Today, it is commonly the act of throwing a pair of [[shoes]] onto telephone wires, power lines, or other raised wires. A related practice is shoe tossing onto [[tree]]s or [[fence]]s.
Urban legends tell that the shoes represent the location where a gang murder or hit took place. In urban areas, it can serve to signal that a drug dealer is nearby or one can purchase drugs in that area. 

Nevertheless, the main reason for dangling shoes on high wires is for recreational or trivial purposes, usually as a prank played by bullies and drinkers. Thrown shoes may also symbolize local culture or traditions of some sort.

== Dangling shoes ==
{{references|section|date=February 2015}}
[[File:Blick durch die Norderstraße mit den Hängenden Schuhen zur Marienkirche (Flensburg), Bild 01.JPG|thumb|Because of the Shoefiti the ''Norderstraße'' (Northern Street) in [[Flensburg]], Germany, is named by the New Yorker travel magazine [[Travel + Leisure]] to one of the "World's Strangest Streets".]]
Shoe dangling, or shoe flinging, is the practice of throwing shoes whose [[shoelace]]s have been tied together so that they hang from overhead [[wire]]s such as [[electric power transmission|power line]]s or [[telephone]] cables. Once the shoes are tied together, the pair is then thrown at the wires as a sort of [[bolas]].

Shoe flinging occurs throughout North America, Latin America and Europe, in rural as well as in urban areas. Usually, the shoes flung at the wires are [[Sneaker (footwear)|sneakers]];  many different varieties of shoes, including [[leather]] shoes and [[boot]]s, also are thrown.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wbez.org/shows/curious-city/shoes-on-a-wire-untangling-an-urban-myth/f46d882f-dd38-452b-98dc-be406135429a|title=Shoes on a Wire: Untangling an Urban Myth|work=WBEZ|access-date=2017-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many cultural variations as well, with differences between socio-economic areas and even age groups.
[[Image:Philmont Scout Ranch boots around sign.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Boy Scout]] throws his boots over the [[Philmont]] entrance sign at Base Camp, a longstanding tradition]]

=== Purpose ===
A number of criminal explanations have been proposed as to why this is done. The foremost is bullying in which a bully steals a pair of shoes and puts them in a place where they are unlikely to be retrieved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Or sometimes it is done as a [[practical joke]] played on [[drunkenness|drunkards]].&lt;ref name="sd" /&gt; An April/May 2003 newsletter from the now former mayor of [[Los Angeles, California]], Mayor James Hahn, cited fears of many Los Angeles residents that "these shoes indicate sites at which drugs are sold or worse yet, gang turf", and that city and utility employees had launched a program to remove the shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|archivedate=2003-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study of shoe tossing data in Chicago found that the rumor and relationship between dangling shoes and drug dealing was [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlated, not causal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wbez.org/shows/curious-city/shoes-on-a-wire-untangling-an-urban-myth/f46d882f-dd38-452b-98dc-be406135429a|title=Shoes on a Wire: Untangling an Urban Myth|work=WBEZ|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other, less criminal explanations have been proposed. In some cultures, shoes are flung to commemorate the end of a [[school]] year, or a forthcoming [[marriage]], as part of a [[rite of passage]]. It has been suggested that the custom may have originated with members of the [[military]], who are said to have thrown military boots, often painted orange or some other conspicuous color, at overhead wires as a part of a rite of passage upon completing [[basic training]] or on leaving the service.&lt;ref name=sd&gt;Adams Cecil (August 2, 1996). [http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_274.html Why do you see pairs of shoes hanging by the laces from power lines?] ''[[The Straight Dope]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1997 [[film]] ''[[Wag the Dog]]'', shoe tossing features as an allegedly spontaneous cultural manifestation of tribute to Sgt. William Schumann, played by [[Woody Harrelson]], who has purportedly been “shot down behind enemy lines” in [[Albania]].

In the [[List of Better Call Saul episodes|''Better Call Saul'' episode]] "Sunk Costs", a pair of dangling shoes is used to surreptitiously plant illegal drugs on a truck.

Others simply say that shoe flinging is a way to get rid of shoes that are no longer wanted, are uncomfortable, or do not fit.&lt;ref name=hub&gt;Wordscribe41. "Shoefiti: Unique Urban Street Art". Hubpages.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=February 2012}} It may also be another manifestation of the human instinct to [[territorial marking|leave their mark on]], and decorate, their surroundings.&lt;ref name=sd/&gt; 

In some neighborhoods, shoes tied together and hanging from power lines or tree branches signify that someone has died. The shoes belong to the dead person. The reason they are hanging, legend has it, is that when the dead person's spirit returns, it will walk that high above the ground, that much closer to heaven.&lt;ref name=hub/&gt;{{Verify source|date=February 2012}} Another superstition holds that the tossing of shoes over the power lines outside of a house is a way to keep the property safe from ghosts.  Yet another legend suggests that shoes hanging from telephone wires signal someone leaving the neighborhood onto bigger and better things.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, Peggy, Becky Bradley, Bettye Sutton, and Sue Goodwin.

==Shoe tree==

A [[Shoe Tree|shoe tree]], not to be confused with the shoe-preservation device [[Shoe tree|of the same name]], is a [[tree]] (or, occasionally, a powerline pole or other wooden object) that has been festooned with old shoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadsideamerica.com/set/shoetrees.html Shoe Trees]. Roadside America.&lt;/ref&gt; Shoe trees are generally located alongside a major local thoroughfare, and may have a theme (such as [[high-heeled shoe]]s).  There are currently at least seventy-six such shoe trees in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Roadside America. [http://www.roadsideamerica.com/roger/QueryTips.php3?tip_AttractionName=shoe+tree&amp;tip_Town=&amp;tip_State=&amp;Submit=Find Search results for "shoe tree."]&lt;/ref&gt; and an undetermined number elsewhere.

== Competitive boot throwing ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
[[File:Boot throwing.ogg|thumb|left|Boot throwing in Finland.]]
{{also|Wellie wanging}}
'''Boot throwing''', or welly wanging, has been a competitive sport in [[New Zealand]] and Britain for many years, although not one that is taken very seriously.  [[Wellington boot]]s are the heavy rubber boots worn by most farm workers and many other outdoor workers.   A competition to see who can throw a boot, or "welly", the furthest is a feature of many Agricultural Field Days in the rural communities. The town of [[Taihape]] in the central [[North Island]] is particularly identified with this sport; they claim to be the Gum Boot Throwing Capital of New Zealand. They hold an annual competition ([[Gumboot Day]]) in the main street and award a Golden Gumboot as the trophy. See also [[Wellie wanging]] in [[Yorkshire]], England.

Since 2003 the sport has been practiced competitively in [[Eastern Europe]]. The 2004 World Championship Competition was won by Germany who is hosting the 2005 Competition at [[Döbeln]]. Teams were also expected from  [[Australia]] and [[Russia]]. Boot throwing has been a popular sport in [[Finland]] since 1976 when the first Finnish Championships of boot throwing was organized.
{{-}}

The Scottish Championships were held in Oban in July 2009 where shoe-throwing pioneers RD Miller &amp; David Gaffney created an impromptu event on the waterfront. This inspired such shoe-throwing legends as Phil Reid (who always favoured the lighter trainer) to pick up the baton -- or the sneaker in this case -- and take it to a wider audience. A more amateur watered-down version is still evident today in certain parts of Oban in July.

== Insult ==
{{see also|List of shoe throwing incidents}}
In many [[Arab people|Arab]] cultures, it is considered an extreme insult to throw a shoe at someone. It is also considered rude even to display the [[Sole (foot)|sole]] of one's foot to someone. In 2008, Iraqi cameraman [[Muntadar al-Zaidi]] threw two shoes at [[United States]] President [[George W. Bush]] while the president was visiting [[Baghdad]], and was arrested and incarcerated. President Bush ducked and was not struck by the shoes.&lt;ref name="Asser_Martin"&gt;{{cite web |last=Asser|first=Martin |title=Bush shoe-ing worst Arab insult |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7783325.stm |accessdate=July 22, 2012 |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoe throwing as an insult is not just limited to the Muslim world, as there are also other notable incidents that have occurred involving other [[celebrity|celebrities]] and world leaders. Some of these have involved [[Steve McCarthy (boxer)|Steve McCarthy]], [[David Beckham]], [[Harry Styles]], [[Lily Allen]], [[Hillary Clinton]], and [[Wen Jiabao]].&lt;ref name="metro_shoe"&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 5 famous shoe throwing incidents |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/615122-top-5-famous-shoe-throwing-incidents |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flipper tossing ==
[[File:Flippers on a wire2.jpg|thumb|Pair of flippers (water footwear) hanging from a wire at 4th Ave. and E 10th St, New York, NY]]  "Flippering" has occurred in the Stoke Croft area of Bristol; a pair of flippers can be seen on Jamaica Street in Bristol.{{cite needed|date=May 2017}}  Flippers have also been seen over a wire in the East Village section of New York City (pictured).

A '''Single Scope Background Investigation''' ('''SSBI''') is a type of United States [[security clearance]] investigation required for [[Top Secret]], [[Sensitive Compartmented Information|SCI]] and [[Q clearance|Q access]], and involves investigators or agents interviewing past employers, coworkers and other individuals associated with the subject of the SSBI. Standard elements include [[background check]]s of employment, education, organization affiliations and any local agency where the subject has lived, worked, traveled or attended school. These checks lead to interviews with persons who know the subject both personally and professionally. The investigation may include a [[National Agency Check with Local Agency Check and Credit Check|NACLC]] of the subject’s [[Marriage|spouse]] or [[cohabitation|cohabitant]]. Previous background investigations conducted on the subject may also be reviewed to corroborate the information obtained or disclosed within the new SSBI.
* '''Minimum investigative scope.''' Past ten (10) years or to age 18, whichever is less.{{clarification needed|date=June 2017}}
* '''Expansion of Investigation.''' The investigation may be expanded as necessary, to resolve issues and/or address employment standards unique to individual agencies.
* '''National Agency Check.''' Checks on subject and spouse/cohabitant of investigative and criminal history files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including submission of fingerprint records on the subject, and such other national agencies (DCII, [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]], [[Office of Personnel Management|OPM]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], etc.) as appropriate to the individual's background.
* '''Subject Interview.''' Required in all cases and shall be conducted by trained security, investigative, or counterintelligence personnel to ensure full investigative coverage. An additional personal interview shall be conducted when necessary to resolve any significant information and/or inconsistencies developed during the investigation.
* '''Birth.''' Independent certification of date and place of birth received directly from appropriate registration authority.
* '''Citizenship.''' Subject must be a U.S. citizen. Independent verification of citizenship received directly from appropriate registration authority. For foreign-born immediate family members, verification of citizenship or legal status is also required.
* '''Education.''' Independent verification of most recent or most significant claimed attendance and/or degree/diploma within the scope of investigation. If all education is outside of the investigative scope, the last education above high school level will be verified.
* '''Employment.''' Direct verification through records of all periods of employment within scope but in any event the most recent two (2) years. Personal interviews of two sources (supervisor/coworkers) for each employment of six months or more shall be attempted. In the event that no employment exceeds six months, interviews of supervisor/coworkers shall be attempted. All periods of unemployment in excess of sixty (60) days shall be verified through records and/or sources. All prior federal/military service and type of discharges shall be verified.
* '''References.''' Four required (at least two of which are developed). To the extent practical, all should have social knowledge of subject and collectively span the entire scope of the investigation.  As appropriate, additional interviews may include cohabitant(s), ex-spouses, and relative(s). Interviews with psychological/medical personnel are to be accomplished as required to resolve issues.
* '''Neighborhood.''' Interviews with neighbors for last three years if residence exceeds six months. Confirmation of current residence shall be accomplished regardless of length, including review of rental records if necessary. In the event no residence exceeds six months, interview of neighbors should be undertaken.
* '''Credit.''' Verification of the subject's financial status and credit habits of all locations where subject has resided, been employed, or attended school for six months or more for the last seven (7) years.
* '''Local Agency Checks.''' A check of appropriate Police records covering all locations where subject has resided, been employed, or attended school for six months or more during the scope of investigation, including current residence regardless of duration. In the event that no residence, employment, or education exceeds six months, local agency checks should be performed.
* '''Public Records.''' Verification of divorce(s), bankruptcy, etc., and any other court (civil or criminal) actions to which subject has been or is a party within the scope of investigation, when known or developed.
* '''Transferability.''' Investigations satisfying the scope and standards specified above are transferable between agencies and shall be deemed to meet the investigative standards for access to collateral Top Secret/[[National security|National Security]] Information and Sensitive Compartmented Information. No further investigation or reinvestigation prior to revalidation every five years will be undertaken unless the agency has substantial information indicating that the transferring individual may not satisfy eligibility standards for clearance or the agency head determines in writing that to accept the investigation would not be in the national security interest of the United States.
* '''Notes.''' Immediate family—spouse, parents, brothers, sisters, children, and cohabitant of the individual requiring access—are tested.

The [[Standard Form 86]] (SF86) is required to begin the background check process. See the "Questionnaire for National Security Positions" at http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/sf86.pdf.  SF86 is now an electronic form known as [[e-QIP]], and the information on an investigation and its status is stored in either JPAS, PIPS or Scattered Castles.

The term now includes other misleading uses of online identities, such as those created to praise, defend or support a person or organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brad |last=Stone |title=The Hand That Controls the Sock Puppet Could Get Slapped |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/technology/16blog.html?ex=1342238400&amp;en=9a3424961f9d2163&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |work=New York Times |date=July 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet manipulation|to manipulate public opinion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China Uses an Army of Sockpuppets to Control Public Opinion – and the US Will Too|url=http://guardianlv.com/2013/11/china-uses-an-army-of-sockpuppets-to-control-public-opinion-and-the-us-will-too/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to circumvent a suspension or ban from a website. A significant difference between the use of a pseudonym&lt;ref&gt;A legitimate pseudonym is sometimes termed an "alt", short for "alternate identity."&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of a sockpuppet is that the sockpuppet poses as an independent third-party unaffiliated with the puppeteer. Sockpuppets are unwelcome in many online communities and may be blocked.

==History==
The first documented use of the term "sockpuppet" dates back to July 9, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |newsgroup=bit.listserv.fnord-l|message-id=248375@AUDUCADM.DUC.AUBURN.EDU |author=Dana Rollins |date= July 9, 1993|url=http://groups.google.com/group/bit.listserv.fnord-l/msg/d1b51c9c2d96469f |title=Arty/Scotto |quote=... one is merely the sock puppet manifestation of the other... |accessdate=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not become common in [[USENET]] groups until 1996. The first ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' entry was "a person whose actions are controlled by another; a minion", with a citation from ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'', March 27, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;''OED'', online edition, June 2011 (accessed August 18, 2011). The reference is to one Jennifer Brand, a 24-year-old student who backed President Clinton in 1996, by calling [[Al Gore|Gore]] 'a sock puppet.'&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of reviewing one's own work under another name predates the Internet. [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Anthony Burgess]] both reviewed their books under pseudonyms.&lt;ref name="NYTamazon"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/14/us/amazon-glitch-unmasks-war-of-reviewers.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm Amy Harmon, "Amazon Glitch Unmasks War Of Reviewers"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable example was [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/l3_wit_name.html "Name That Ben"], PBS.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2013 the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) condemned paid advocacy sockpuppeting on Wikipedia and, on October 23, specifically banned [[Wiki-PR editing of Wikipedia|editing by the public relations firm Wiki-PR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/11/19/wikimedia-foundation-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-wikipr/|title=Wikimedia Foundation sends cease and desist letter to WikiPR  «  Wikimedia blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August and September 2015 the WMF uncovered another group of sockpuppets known as [[Orangemoody editing of Wikipedia|Orangemoody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/06/wikipedia-founder-backs-sites-systems-after-extortion-scam|title=Wikipedia founder backs site's systems after extortion scam|first=Stuart|last=Dredge|date=September 6, 2015|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Block evasion===
One reason for sockpuppeting is to circumvent a [[Block (Internet)|block]], ban or other form of sanction imposed on the person's original account. After access is restricted, people may try to get around the sanctions by using alternate accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Poland, Bailey: ''Haters: Harassment, Abuse, and Violence Online'', p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ballot stuffing===
Sockpuppets may be created during an online poll to submit multiple votes in favor of the puppeteer. A related usage is the creation of multiple identities, each supporting the puppeteer's views in an argument, attempting to position the puppeteer as representing majority opinion and sideline opposition voices. In the abstract theory of [[social network]]s and [[reputation system]]s, this is known as a [[sybil attack]].

A sockpuppet-like use of deceptive fake identities is used in [[stealth marketing]]. The stealth marketer creates one or more pseudonymous accounts, each one claiming to be owned by a different enthusiastic supporter of the sponsor's product, book or ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/may/21/shouldcommercialbloggingbe |title=Should stealth marketing be regulated? |date=May 21, 2008 |work=The Guardian | first=Mark | last=Sweney | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/43456 |title=I'd Love This Product Even If I Weren't A Stealth Marketer |date=December 14, 2005 |publisher=[[The Onion]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216010438/http://www.theonion.com/content/node/43456 |archivedate=December 16, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strawman sockpuppet===
A strawman sockpuppet is a [[false flag]] pseudonym created to make a particular [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]] look foolish or unwholesome in order to generate negative sentiment against it. Strawman sockpuppets typically behave in an unintelligent, uninformed, or [[bigoted]] manner and advance "[[straw man]]" arguments that their puppeteers can easily refute. The intended effect is to [[outgroup homogeneity bias|discredit]] more rational arguments made for the same position.&lt;ref&gt;Thomler, Craig (April 27, 2011). [http://govinthelab.com/battle-of-the-sockpuppets-part-of-the-discussion-at-media140-brisbane/ "Battle of the sockpuppets"], ''Government in the Lab: The Online Magazine for Government and Politics Around the World''&lt;/ref&gt; Such sockpuppets behave in a similar manner to [[Internet troll|Internet trolls]]. 

A particular case is the [[Internet troll#Concern troll|concern troll]], a [[false flag]] pseudonym created by a user whose actual point of view is opposed to the one that the sockpuppet claims to hold. The concern troll posts in Web forums devoted to its declared point of view and attempts to sway the group's actions or opinions while claiming to share their goals, but with professed "concerns". The goal is to sow fear, uncertainty and doubt (aka [[Fear uncertainty and doubt|FUD]]) within the group.

===Meatpuppet===
{{Redirect|Meatpuppet|the band|Meat Puppets}}
The term "meatpuppet" (or "meat puppet") is an online version of a [[shill]], and is used as a [[pejorative]] description of various online behaviors. The term was in use before the Internet gained public awareness, including references in [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s science fiction story "The Diary of the Rose" (1976),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Le Guin | first = Ursula | authorlink = Ursula K.

''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' columnist Lore Sjöberg put "meat puppet" first on a satirical list of "common terms used at Wikipedia", defining the term as "a person who disagrees with you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lore Sj&amp;#246;berg |url=https://www.wired.com/software/webservices/commentary/alttext/2006/04/70670 |title=The Wikipedia FAQK |work=Wired |date=January 4, 2009|accessdate=June 5, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327092708/http://www.wired.com/software/webservices/commentary/alttext/2006/04/70670 |archivedate=March 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, other online sources use the term "meatpuppet" to describe sockpuppet behaviors. For example, according to one online encyclopedia, a meat puppet "publishes comments on blogs, [[wikis]] and other public venues about some phenomenon or product in order to generate public interest and buzz"—that is, he/she is engaged in behavior more widely known as "[[astroturfing]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=meat puppet Definition: TechEncyclopedia from TechWeb |url=http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=meat+puppet |publisher=The Computer Language Company |accessdate=28 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716025003/http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=meat+puppet |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 article in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' defined a meat puppet as "a peculiar inhabitant of the digital world—a fictional character that passes for a real person online."&lt;ref&gt;Read, Brock (October 9, 2006) [[The Chronicle of Higher Education|The Chronicle of Higher Education: The Wired Campus]] ''[http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/1623/attack-of-the-meat-puppets Attack of the 'Meat Puppets']''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahrens, Frank (October 7, 2006) [[Washington Post]] ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/06/AR2006100601742.html'Puppets' Emerge as Internet's Effective, and Deceptive, Salesmen]'' Page D01&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation of sockpuppetry==
A number of techniques have been developed to determine whether accounts are sockpuppets, including comparing the [[IP address]]es of suspected sockpuppets and comparative analysis of the [[writing style]] of suspected sockpuppets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127107-sock-puppet-accounts-unmasked-by-the-way-they-write-and-post/|title=Sock puppet accounts unmasked by the way they write and post|first=Edd|last=Gent|publisher=''[[New Scientist]]''|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 49-year-old Missouri resident Lori Drew was [[United States v. Lori Drew|prosecuted]] and found guilty by a Federal court jury in connection with the creation of a MySpace account on which she claimed to be a 16-year-old boy named Josh Evans. Drew's goal had been to create a relationship with [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier]], a 13-year-old girl who had been in conflict with Drew's daughter. After "Josh" ended the relationship with Megan, Megan committed suicide. Drew was found guilty in connection with misrepresenting her identity in violation of the MySpace terms of service. 

Although the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|Los Angeles U.S. Attorney]] claimed that this conduct was covered by federal [[computer fraud]] legislation against "accessing a computer without authorization via [[interstate commerce]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081204.wgtweb05/BNStory/Technology/home |publisher=CTVglobemedia |work=Globe and Mail |location=Toronto, Canada |date=December 4, 2008 |title=Cyberbullying verdict turns rule-breakers into criminals |first=Ivor |last=Tossell |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209060005/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081204.wgtweb05/BNStory/Technology/home |archivedate=December 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2205952/pagenum/all/ |publisher=The Washington Post Company |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=December 3, 2008 |title=Lori Drew is a meanie}}&lt;/ref&gt; the trial court granted a motion by Drew to throw out the verdict. Drew successfully argued that her use of a false identity did not constitute unauthorized access to MySpace, citing a 1973 [[breach of contract]] dispute where a court of appeals ruled that "fraudulently induced consent is consent nonetheless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/12/lori-drew-attor.html |work=[[Wired News]] |publisher=Condé Nast Publishing |date=December 15, 2008 |title=Lori Drew Files New Bid for Dismissal on Grounds that MySpace Authorized Access |first=Kim |last=Zetter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution appealed the trial court judge's decision to throw out the guilty verdict, but later dropped its appeal.&lt;ref name="urlLori Drew cleared of MySpace cyber-bullying"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/lori-drew-cleared-of-myspace-cyberbullying-20090703-d6s0.html |title=Lori Drew cleared of MySpace cyber-bullying | work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=July 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, in ''[[People v. Golb]]'', 50-year-old lawyer Raphael Golb was convicted on 30 criminal charges, including identity theft, criminal impersonation, and aggravated harassment, for using multiple sockpuppet accounts to attack and impersonate historians he perceived as rivals of his father, [[Norman Golb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/dispute-over-dead-sea-scrolls-leads-to-a-jail-sentence/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=Dispute Over Dead Sea Scrolls Leads to a Jail Sentence|first=John|last=Eligon|publisher=New York Times|date=18 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Golb defended his actions as "satirical hoaxes" protected by free-speech rights. He was disbarred and sentenced to six months in prison but remained free on appeal on $25,000 bail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2010/11/web_harassment_online_aliases.html "NY lawyer gets jail in Dead Sea Scrolls case" (November 18, 2010) AP].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 a Florida state circuit court held that sock puppetry is tortious interference with business relations, and awarded injunctive relief against it during the pendency of litigation. The court found that "the act of falsifying multiple identities" is conduct that should be enjoined. It explained that the conduct was wrongful "not because the statements are false or true, but because the conduct of making up names of persons who do not exist to post fake comments by fake people to support Defendants' position tortiously interferes with Plaintiffs' business" and such "conduct is inherently unfair." The court, therefore, ordered the defendants to "remove or cause to be removed all postings creating the false impression that more [than one] person are commenting on the program th[an] actually exist." The court also found, however, that the comments of the defendants "which do not create a false impression of fake patients or fake employees or fake persons connected to program (those posted under their respective names) are protected by The Constitution of the United State of America, First Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2017/01/NewDirections.pdf ''[[New Directions for Young Adults, Inc. v.

During the 2007 trial of [[Conrad Black]], chief executive of [[Sun-Times Media Group|Hollinger International]], prosecutors alleged that he had posted messages on a Yahoo Finance chat room using the name "nspector", attacking [[short (finance)|short sellers]] and blaming them for his company's stock performance. Prosecutors provided evidence of these postings in [[Black v. United States|Black's criminal trial]] where he was convicted of mail fraud and obstruction. The postings were raised at multiple points in the trial.&lt;ref name="NYT2007"/&gt;

===Book and film reviews===
An [[Amazon.com]] computer glitch in 2004 revealed the names of many authors who had written reviews of their books using pseudonyms. [[John Rechy]], who wrote the best-selling 1963 novel ''[[City of Night]]'', was one of the more famous authors unmasked in this way, and was shown to have written numerous five-star reviews of his own work.&lt;ref name="NYTamazon"/&gt; In 2010, historian [[Orlando Figes]] was found to have written Amazon reviews under the names "orlando-birkbeck" and "historian", praising his own books and condemning those of fellow historians Rachel Polonsky and [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]]. The two sued Figes and won monetary damages.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lea and Matthew Taylor [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/23/historian-orlando-figes-amazon-reviews-rivals "Historian Orlando Figes admits posting Amazon reviews that trashed rivals"], ''The Guardian'', April 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10670407 "Orlando Figes to pay fake Amazon review damages"], BBC, July 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; During a panel in 2012, UK fiction writer [[Stephen Leather]] admitted using pseudonyms to praise his own books, claiming that "everyone does it".

As an example of [[state-sponsored Internet sockpuppetry]], In 2011, a California company called [[Ntrepid]] was awarded a $2.76 million contract from [[US Central Command]] for "online persona management" operations&lt;ref name=guard&gt;Nick Fielding and Ian Cobain, [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks "Revealed: US spy operation that manipulates social media"], ''The Guardian.

On September 11, 2014, a number of sockpuppet accounts reported an explosion at a chemical plant in Louisiana. The reports came on a range of media, including Twitter and YouTube, but US authorities claimed the entire event to be a hoax.

}}'''Sonshine Festival''' is a [[Christian music festival]] held annually, starting in 1982 in [[Willmar, Minnesota]] and continuing in that location through 2014. That same year, festival organizers announced its relocation to [[Somerset, Wisconsin]] for 2015 onward because of an inability to attract sufficient people to the original location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=West Central Tribune |title=Sonshine leaving Willmar, relocating to Wis. in 2015 |url=http://www.wctrib.com/content/sonshine-leaving-willmar-relocating-wis-2015 |access-date=2014-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.willmarradio.com/news/breaking-sonshine-music-festival-relocating-to-wisconsin/article_0e482d9c-6bc5-11e4-b2ad-7769157a6071.html |title=Breaking: Sonshine Music Festival Relocating to Wisconsin |date=November 14, 2014 |access-date=October 3, 2016 |publisher=Willmar Radio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12688">'''Speed networking''' (or '''speed business meeting''') is a meeting format designed to accelerate business contacts. 

Speed networking basically involves participants gathering together to exchange [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/02/technology/02iht-network.4077677.html “Businesses try a form of speed dating” By Julie Bick, International Herald Tribune, January 2, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Participants greet each other in a series of brief exchanges during a set period of time. During an interaction, participants share their professional backgrounds and business goals. Networkers are generally seeking exposure to new markets and/or expanding their pool of vendors.

==History==
Speed networking is often referenced as a derivative of [[speed dating]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://excellenceinbusiness.org/?s=speed+networking “Speed Networking for Business Success” By Terry Frerker, Excellence In Business, September 5, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; the round-robin approach to meeting potential suitors first developed by Rabbi Yaacov Deyo in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://people.tamu.edu/~eastwick/FinkelEastwick_CDir.pdf |title=“Speed-Dating” by Eli J. Finkel and Paul W. Eastwick, Northwestern University, Volume 17—Number 3, Copyright 2008, Association for Psychological Science, Current Directions in Psychological Science }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(111&amp;nbsp;KB)}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Speed networking combines speed dating with business networking.  It is thought to have started in the United States and/or the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/speed-networking.html MacMillan Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Speed networking was first utilized during the early 2000s and began rising in popularity by the end of the decade.&lt;ref name="businessweek2006"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_37/b4000088.htm “Speed Dating For Suits” By Jena McGregor, BusinessWeek, September 11, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Credit for applying speed dating concepts to the corporate world has been attributed to Tom Jaffee, a founder of a speed-dating network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/jul2007/bs20070717_728646.htm “Three, Two, One—Network!” By Sonal Rupani, BusinessWeek July 18, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, speed networking was introduced by Michael Piddock, future founder of event technology company Glisser [https://www.glisser.com], to increase employee-to-employee connections in corporate events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/global-firms-networking-begins-within-lse-van-722436.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the techniques for speed dating and speed networking can be similar – participants paired or grouped together for the purpose of introduction – the practices differ in their end goals. Speed daters are trying to narrow down their choices by eliminating the unsuitable; conversely, speed networkers are trying to broaden their connections by increasing their exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entrepreneur.com/marketing/networking/article180954.html “Speed Networking and Beyond” By Ivan Misner, Entrepreneur, June 28, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Speed networking is based on three models
* Round Robin - meeting random participants one-on-one sequentially.
* Station-based - meeting specific participants based on pre-assignments.  
* Group-based - meeting with a preselected group.

Most speed networking events begin in an open room for Participants to mingle.  The host then explains the structure of the event.  The moderator will place time limits on the participants interactions, telling them when the time intervals have expired. if the event calls for participants to moved to preassigned tables or groups, the moderator will facilitate this.

==Models/modalities==
[[File:2011 Medicen Business dating.jpg|thumb|One to one speed networking]]

===Round robin===
In the Round Robin model, participants meet each other sequentially in random pairings. To facilitate movement of participants, the chairs in the room are often organized in two circles or facing rows of desks. 

The host opens the first round of meetings, usually with a bell or buzzer.  The two participants in each meeting introduce themselves, briefly summarizing their business histories and goals. They often exchange business cards and possibly additional information for a follow-up meeting. 

After a set time period of a few minutes, the host stops the first round of meetings. Then either the inner or outer circle participants – or the front or back line of desks – moves to the next space. Following a brief settling-in period, the host starts the second round of meetings. 

In Round Robin speed networking, a participant would meet an average of 10 contacts during an hour-long event.

===Station-based===
In the Station-based model, participants meet each other individually based on a pre-assignment. Prior to coming to the event, participants fill out a questionnaire listing their business background (job title and industry) and whom they wish to meet (suppliers, customers or vendors). The profiles are then matched electronically and a list of meetings is generated for participants based on their preferences. At the event, numbered stations are set up where participants meet with their assigned partners according to their list for a set period of time. A typical station-based speed networking event may yield 7 to 10 contacts during an hour-long event.

===Group-based===
In the Group-based model, participants are assigned to a sequence of tables. Each table seats a specific number of participants, depending on attendance. A typical event may call for tables of four to 10. Table assignments are often predetermined by computer software but other techniques can be used to determine the groups each attendee participates in. Each participant at the table takes a few minutes – the length of these introductions can also be set – to introduce him or herself. Time at the table varies based on how the event organiser coordinate the event but usually lasts five to 15 minutes.

==Applications==
Speed networking has many applications. Many organizations use speed networking to structure events: alumni associations, chambers of commerce, business associations, universities and trade shows. Events that benefit from speed networking include: membership drives, networking events, mentoring programs, career fairs, team building exercises and vendor pairings. Speed networking is particularly useful "when many organisations are gathering at large events."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.management-issues.com/2006/8/24/research/speed-dating-giving-way-to-speed-networking.asp “Speed Dating Giving Way to Speed Networking” By Nic Paton, Management-Issues, July 22, 2005. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed Mentoring===
In speed [[mentoring]], the goal is to facilitate suitable relationships between mentors and mentees.matches.&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2010-04-06-speed-mentoring_N.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Speed mentoring sessions are typically "a series of short, focused conversations about specific questions. You will meet with a limited number of mentees in 10-minute time slots each. When directed, mentees will proceed to their mentor's table."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uccs.edu/Documents/alumni/mentor_guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Speed mentoring is effective because the mentee experiences several different interactions with prospective mentors in a short period of time. This maximises the opportunity to find a suitable mentor.

Speed mentoring events can be traced back to the architectural profession.  In  2001-2003, Grace H. Kim, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.schemataworkshop.com/grace/&lt;/ref&gt; through her work as the [[Intern Development Program (IDP)|Intern Development Program]] (IDP) Washington State Coordinator advocated for interns to find a mentor outside their firm.  However, she found that many young interns, especially those new to Seattle, had a difficult time identifying potential mentors.  In 2006, after Kim and Lee W. Waldrep co-hosted an [[American Institute of Architecture Students|American Institute of Architecture Students (AIAS)]] salon on mentorship at the National [[American Institute of Architects]] Convention, the idea of Speed Mentoring was born. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aia.org/practicing/AIAPodnet/pod_speed&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 National AIA Convention, Kim and Waldrep co-presented a session entitled Speed Mentoring: Developing You, an Emerging Professional and over 100 attendees participated - representing the spectrum of interns to senior leadership.  After a brief overview of mentorship and the available resources, this interactive session required attendees to participate in a live demonstration of the program.  They were asked to stand in a line based on their number of years in the profession.  Then the line was folded in half and individuals were asked to move their chairs to face one another.  A bell was rung at which time the two facing individuals traded business cards, introduced themselves and shared what they were looking for in a mentoring relationship.  At five minutes, the bell was rung again and one row of people moved two seats down.  This process was repeated four times.  While they were not asked to rank their top choices, the idea was that if this exercise were repeated at a local chapter or in a large office, the interns could rank their mentor preferences.  And likewise, the mentor could rank their preferences for a protégé – hopefully resulting in a better mentor match.
The session was a success and was subsequently repeated at two National AIA Conventions (San Antonio and Boston).  More importantly, the participants took the idea home to implement in various settings.
==Speed mentoring sponsors==
Some universities have also established speed mentoring events including:
* [[University of Kentucky]], which has also developed a mentorship tool kit.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uky.edu/PCW/Speed%20Mentoring%20Toolkitfinal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[City College of New York]]
* [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic State University (San Luis Obispo)]]
* [[University of Maryland]]
* [[University of California - Berkeley]].

Other industries in which speed mentoring events have been publicized include:
* [[International Interior Design Association]] (NY Chapter)  – Oct 10, 2012 (Annual)
* NEWH (Hospitality Industry Network)
* [[American Society of Media Photographers]]
* [[Information Architecture Institute]]
* [[Wings of Hope Children's Charity|Wings of Hope]] (UK)
* Women of the World Festivals (UK)

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Speed networking has advantages over typical meet-and-greet events.

===For participants ===
Speed networking facilitates the meeting of individuals who may not have had the opportunity to exchange information without a structured environment. Each attendee is "guaranteed to meet more people than [he/she] typically would using traditional networking during the same amount of time." &lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.jvf.com/2009/03/14/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-a-speed-networking-event/ “How to Get the Most Out of a Speed Networking Event” By James Feudo, Overnight Sensation, March 14, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; It relieves participants of the stress of introductions as attendees all have a single purpose. It rids the awkward "exit" by having time limits – no need to find a way to bow out of a conversation gracefully – and therefore increases the number of potential new meets.

However, there are also risks for attendees, and these relate to an unfortunate perception that a business relationship can also be speed-tracked, as well as a misconception that quantity is of prime importance. Members still need to take time to develop relationships with individual fellow members outside the networking event and the importance of this cannot be overestimated.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Other principles of good networking, such as an attitude of giving, not pushing, business cards or marketing material at people, for example, still stand.  People can not just drop in during a round robin event as it disrupts the flow and matching.

===For hosts===
Speed networking positions the host as an expert in information exchange and business leadership. It adds value to organizations whose structure is innate to business mingling, like alumni associations and chambers of commerce.

The different speed networking models have their own benefits. Group-based speed networking, for example, provides the opportunity to meet a maximum number of people with less stress on the participant or repetition of your personal information.&lt;ref name="businessweek2006"/&gt;

'''Star Idol''' ({{zh|s=明星偶像}})  was a Singaporean televised acting competition held in 2005 and aired on [[MediaCorp TV Channel 8]]. The competition was first announced through the Internet on 11 August 2005, and elimination rounds commenced on November 2 of the same year. The programme aired weekly on Wednesdays at 8:00pm and ended with a two-hour grand final on March 19, 2006.

==Background==
When the official announcement for Star Idol was made via Internet, an article posted asked for suggestions of the mascot. It was later decided that a large red gorilla that resembled [[King Kong]] would become the official mascot for Star Idol.

==Selection process==

===Auditions===
To be eligible for Star Idol, contestants must be either a Singaporean citizen or permanent resident and belong to the age range of 16 and 35. There was no specification for race, although fluency in the Chinese language is required due to the competition being Chinese-based. Auditions were held on September 3, 2005. Participants had to memorize dialogues from five scripts given, one of which would be randomly chosen by the panel of judges to be performed during the actual audition. Registration for the competition required a fee of S$10, which was paid on the day of the audition itself. An estimated total of 2,000 people auditioned for Star Idol.

Roughly 500 people from the auditions made the cut and became part of the callbacks. The number of contestants was filtered down by a series of eliminations until only 10 male and female semi-finalists remained to compete in the quarter finals.

===Quarter-Finals===
The quarter-finals saw the pairing up of one male and one female contestant. An ever-changing panel of judges would comment after an acting performance by each pair. However, the fates of the contestants were decided by public voting. Each week, one male and one female contestant is eliminated until 4 of each remain. The final 8 would proceed to the Semi-finals of the competition.

===Semi-Finals===
Alicia Neo, Jacqueline Sue, Leann Koh, Lilian Lai, Bryan Wang, Kang Cheng Xi, Lincoln Khoo and Leo Lam became the eight Semi-finalists of Star Idol and had to compete in an interactive television drama titled Who Is It?. Episodes of Who Is It? were pre-recorded and aired every Wednesday at 8:00pm. The only shows recorded live were through the results shows at 10:30pm, with the exception of the episode on February 22, 2006. It was pre-recorded and aired at 11:30pm due to the airing of the [[eulogy]] of former Singapore Deputy Prime Minister [[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam]] at 10:30pm, who died earlier that day.

Who Is It? also stars veteran actors San Yow and [[Ann Kok]], who play a multimillionaire and his assistant respectively. A multimillionaire named Cao Wan Neng brings eight people who have crossed paths with him and at some points, helped him, to his island where he allows them to take a breather and relax. An assortment of events occurs on the island, with each episode ending with a cliffhanger. An anonymous scream takes place to conclude each episode, signifying the sudden disappearance of one of them. It is metaphorical for their running in the competition. The contestant with the least votes is eliminated from Star Idol and is identified in the next episode of the interactive drama as the character who goes missing.

Lilian Lai is the first contestant to leave after garnering the least among votes at the end of the first episode. In the Who Is It? universe, the remaining contestants become suspicious. A quack inspector called Inspector Zhu (Thomas Ong) is hired to investigate. Subsequently, more contestants are eliminated from the competition, namely Bryan, Leann and Lincoln, thus developing the story of the interactive drama.

The television series continue with contestants Leo and Jacqueline discovering that Cao Wan Neng is in fact an impostor donning a mask. Simultaneously, eliminated contestants Lilian, Leann, Bryan and Lincoln convene at a remote side of the island with the real Wan Neng, An assassin hired to kill them chases them to the sea, where Wan Neng finds a raft that may only accommodate another person apart from himself. This acts as a metaphor for the Wildcard episode, with only one contestant being allowed to return. When Bryan was successfully revived back into the competition as part of a Wildcard-like episode, his character was identified as the person whom Wan Neng rescued.

The assassin was never found and the imposter wearing Wan Neng's mask ran away. The former three contestants were badly injured and were taken to hospitals. Meanwhile, Jacqueline is investigating into her mother's past when she realises that Wan Neng might be biologically related to him. Her investigation becomes interrupted when suddenly goes missing. More suspects emerge, including An An, who was seen in red liquid all over her body the day after Alicia, the next contestant, goes missing. The red liquid was proved to be paint instead of blood, but Cheng Xi's romantic relationship with her ends. Bryan was thought to be a suspect once due to his unstable personality after Jacqueline, his girlfriend, became missing.

The last episode of the drama hinted the deaths of Alicia and Jacqueline. The villain behind these cases is Inspector Zhu, who already had intentions to kill them. The last scene of the interactive drama shows the inspector firing a gunshot, which fatally kills one of the three remaining contestants. Cheng Xi was eliminated from the competition, but the drama concluded without revealing if Bryan or Leo, the final two, was the sole survivor on the island.

===Finals===
The judging process of the finals differs from the semi-finals. The original production was replaced by a drama consisting of three acting segments that depicted two men competing to become an actor. [[Julian Hee]] plays a rich director of an acting company and being the judge for Leo and Bryan, who were auditioning to become actors.

The finals begins with Leo playing a tardy participant of an acting audition. Because of his lack of punctuality, Bryan begins first. The first segment consists of fighting scenes, where Bryan was in a bare-knuckle fight with [[Adam Chen]] and Leo did a sword fighting sequence with [[Zheng Geping]].

In the second segment, Leo asks the director out on a date where he tells her that he has fallen for her. However, he is rejected. Meanwhile, at another side of the restaurant Leo is at, Bryan is with Paris (played by [[Felicia Chin]]), his girlfriend. The two of them kisses.

When the 3 parts had ended, the actual judges of Star Idol revealed who they thought should be winner. All of them chose Bryan over Leo. However, their choices do not determine the results due to the competition being decided completely by public voting.

Bryan Wang was announced winner of Star Idol, who had garnered 61% of the total votes. He won himself a 2-year contract with Mediacorp.

The bottom two breakdown shows a Final 5 after the Top 5. This is because a revival round was held for the 4 ousted contestants, in which, Bryan (the eventual winner) was revived, forming the Final Five with the other four which got through the first four cuts.

==Criticism==

Star Idol was an acting competition, with format similar to singing competitions like Singapore Idol and Project Superstar, where the winner was determined by public voting instead of professional judging.

The interactive drama Who Is It? was criticised for its unrealistic and distracted nature. The ever-changing and unpredictable script of the drama also caused several storyline flaws and loopholes. Jacqueline drugged and attempted to rape Cheng Xi prior to her character "disappearing" from the television show. However, neither Cheng Xi nor her existing girlfriend Alicia were deemed suspects. Inspector Zhu played a completely innocent person and was seen investigating the cases even when he was alone and did not need to pretend. However, he was conclusively revealed as the ultimate villain of the show. It is justifiable that he was neurotic.

==Post-Star Idol careers==
Only winner Bryan Wang and second-runner up Kang Cheng Xi were offered contracts with Mediacorp. Bryan's first role was playing Shu Tang in [[An Enchanted Life]]. Cheng Xi's first role was the second male lead after [[Li Nan Xing]] as Ma Lu in [[A Million Treasures]]. Other contestants like Lincoln, Alicia and Leann have appeared in minor roles or calefares that appear for less than a minute. Examples are Lincoln being a gangster. Leann has a larger role and plays Ma Lu's (Cheng Xi) first love interest who cheats on him. Jacqueline was offered a supporting role as Ah Lian, Joanne Peh's best friend, in Like Father Like Daughter, for which she received a Best Supporting Actress Star Awards  nomination.

'''Stig Svante Stockselius''' (born 31 December 1955 in [[Hudiksvall]]) is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[journalist]] and television executive, former Head of Song Contests at the [[European Broadcasting Union]], executive supervisor of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] (ESC) and the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]]. Svante’s son is named Samuel Stockselius, and goes to a school in Stockholm. His daughter’s name is Lydia, and goes to a local school as well. His wife is a bruenette.

==Early life and career==
Svante Stockselius grew up in [[Ockelbo Municipality|Ockelbo]], a small town in central Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dagens Nyheter |url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1159&amp;a=174363&amp;maNo=-1 |title=Prinsessan och pojken av folket |accessdate=2007-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001145600/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1159&amp;a=174363&amp;maNo=-1 |archivedate=2007-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his career as a journalist. For 16 years, he worked for the [[Stockholm]]-based evening newspaper ''[[Expressen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV4.se|url=http://www.tv4.se/245058.html|title=Svante Stockselius till TV4|accessdate=2007-01-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121224231601/http://www.tv4.se/245058.html|archivedate=2012-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As head of the entertainment division of the Swedish [[Public broadcasting|public service]] [[television]] company [[Sveriges Television]] from the late 1990s, he worked with the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000 Eurovision Song Contest]], held in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=YLE|url=http://www.yle.fi/eurovision/main_lite.php?id=1242|title=Svante Stockselius är chef för hela ESC|accessdate=2007-01-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121208225706/http://www.yle.fi/eurovision/main_lite.php?id=1242|archivedate=2012-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the architect of a major revamp of the Swedish ESC qualification competition, [[Melodifestivalen]], in 2002, introducing four semi-finals and a Second Chance round preceding the finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gylleneskor.se|url=http://www.gylleneskor.se/history/logged/mf_year.php?mf_year=2002|title=Melodifestivalen 2002|accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Estonia]]'s ESC victory in 2001, Stockselius was asked by the Estonian television channel [[Eesti Televisioon|ETV]] to take part in the preparations for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002 event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=YLE|url=http://www.yle.fi/eurovision/main_lite.php?id=1242|title=Svante Stockselius är chef för hela ESC|accessdate=2007-01-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121208225706/http://www.yle.fi/eurovision/main_lite.php?id=1242|archivedate=2012-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 he went on to work for the commercial Swedish television channel [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV4.se|url=http://www.tv4.se/245058.html|title=Svante Stockselius till TV4|accessdate=2007-01-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121224231601/http://www.tv4.se/245058.html|archivedate=2012-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 he was offered the job as ESC Executive Supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sundsvalls Tidning|url=http://www.st.nu/noje/index.php?action=visa_artikel&amp;id=313912|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234832/http://www.st.nu/noje/index.php?action=visa_artikel&amp;id=313912|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-09-26|title=Stockselius blir schlagerchef|accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on 30 August 2010 that he would be resigning after the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2010]] to "give others the opportunity to take the event to the next level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=19923&amp;_t=Svante+Stockselius+says+Eurovision+farewell|title=Svante Stockselius says Eurovision farewell|date=30 August 2010|accessdate=30 August 2010|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|publisher=[[Eurovision]] website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010 Norwegian television executive [[Jon Ola Sand]] was appointed the new executive supervisor of the ESC.

{{See also|Free party|Rave}}
'''Teknivals''' (the word is a [[portmanteau]] of the words [[free tekno|tekno]] and [[music festival|festival]]) are large [[free party|free parties]] which take place worldwide. They take place most often in Europe and are often illegal under various national or regional laws. They vary in size from dozens to thousands of people, depending on factors such as accessibility, reputation, weather, and law enforcement. The parties often take place in venues far away from residential areas such as squatted warehouses, empty military bases, beaches, forests or fields. The teknival phenomenon is a [[grassroots]] movement which has grown out of the [[rave]], [[punk rock|punk]], reggae [[Sound system (DJ)|sound system]] and [[New age travellers|UK traveller]] scenes and spawned an entire [[subculture]]. Summer is the usual season for teknivals.

==History==
[[File:Chenilval 006.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Paris Teknival, May 2005]]
Teknivals are a larger scale version of free parties and emerged in the early 1990s, when [[acid house party|acid house parties]] and [[New age travellers|travellers]] in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] became the target of political repression, culminating in the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]].&lt;ref name="CJ94"&gt;Full Government text of [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/Ukpga_19940033_en_6.htm#mdiv63 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994] section 63  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104043429/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/Ukpga_19940033_en_6.htm#mdiv63 |date=January 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 63 of the Act gave the police new powers to close down illegal parties.

[[freetekno soundsystem|Sound systems]] then started travelling to countries in Europe where laws were less restrictive and the authorities were uncertain how to stop the festivals. One of the most famous of these sound systems was [[Spiral Tribe]], which was at the forefront of the free party movement in Europe. Other systems were called [[Bedlam sound system|Bedlam]], Circus Normal, Circus Warp and Vox Populi. Desert Storm sound system organised teknivals in France and Spain and brought raves to war-torn [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia, in 1996. At one party the front-line was 10&amp;nbsp;kilometres away and they were asked to turn off their lights in case they attracted enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undercurrents.org/desertstorm23/desert1.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217135659/http://www.undercurrents.org/desertstorm23/desert1.htm |date=December 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some teknivals are one-off events, most take place every year on or around the same date; the biggest, such as the ones in [[France]] or [[Czech Republic]], can attract up to 100,000 visitors (2003, France).

Just as the word 'teknival' was formed by merging the words 'tekno' and 'festival', teknivals in different countries are referred to by abbreviated names, such as the aforementioned [[Czechtek]], Frenchtek (North France) and also Poltek (Poland), Slovtek (Slovakia), Southtek (South Germany), Bulgariatek (Bulgaria), Rotek(Romania) Helltek(Greece, Hellas in Greek), Dutchtek (Netherlands), Easttek (East Germany), U-Tek (Ukraine), [[Northtek]] (Canada) and Occitek ([[Occitania]], South France). NorthTek was held on [[Crown Land]] in [[Ontario]].

==Features==
===Music===
{{See also|Free tekno}}
Since a teknival can last a week or longer, many musical styles will be represented. The music which grew in tandem with teknivals was [[free tekno]], which is characterised by heavy, repetitive kick drums and is normally about 180 [[Beats per minute|bpm]]. The DJs and party goers are unconcerned by musical boundaries, so a lot of different, mostly electronic, music is played and performed.

Most sound systems play styles such as [[acidcore]], [[acid techno]], hardcore, [[spiral tekno]],frenchcore, [[electro (music)|electro]], [[techno]], [[Oldschool jungle|jungle music]], [[raggacore]], [[skullstep]], [[neurofunk]], [[breakcore]], schranz and [[speedcore]]. Instead of focusing on genre, the music can be characterised by being more underground than the music heard in clubs and at commercial parties, although some sound systems might specialise in a certain subgenre. The music is played by [[DJ]]s playing vinyl records and [[Mp3]] files on a [[computer]]. Livesets are also frequently played using a variety of equipment: [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[drum machines]], [[Effects pedal|guitar effects pedals]], [[MIDI controller]] and [[computers]].

At early teknivals, sound systems would play until either no-one was left dancing or the [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] ran out in the [[electrical generator|generator]].

===Subculture===

[[File:Czechtek 2001.JPG|thumb|300px|right|[[CzechTek]] 2001]]
The teknival is often regarded as an example of what [[Hakim Bey]] has termed the [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermetic.com/bey/taz_cont.html The Temporary Autonomous Zone]&lt;/ref&gt; though in interviews Bey has professed that rave culture's interest in technology remains problematic for the implementation of the TAZ. However this has not stopped various groups from claiming the teknival and rave culture in general as the implementation of the TAZ.&lt;ref&gt;http://quadrantcrossing.org/papers/ItsNotARave-Fuse2003-tV.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001054704/http://quadrantcrossing.org/papers/ItsNotARave-Fuse2003-tV.pdf |date=October 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone is welcome to enter the site, there is no ticket or fee. Normally any artist who turns up is encouraged to participate. Over the course of a few days the site can grow into a confusing village of sound systems, cafes, tents and vehicles.

At the teknival site one finds a mixed group of young people which may include students, tekno travellers, squatters and hippies, bonded together by their love for listening to [[free tekno]] 'sous les etoiles' (translation: 'under the stars') - as an early flyer proclaimed.

It is usually the perception that there is no "coherent" politics or philosophical stance represented by the teknival subculture, mainly due to the fact that emphasis is placed on individual freedom. Many young teknival goers are disillusioned with mainstream politics. Nevertheless, the parties themselves require complex collective organisation and, in order to be successful, a sustainable environment of community relations. In themselves such events can be seen as a political statement of self-organisation at a distance from the State. Clashes with the police have mobilised some people to action against laws which would prohibit self-organisation and gathering to enjoy teknivals. These clashes date back to the '80s (when teknivals were arguably indistinguishable from UK Orbital raves, summer acid house parties, UK traveller gatherings, Stonehenge pagan events, early Burning Man and tribal gatherings, trance parties in Goa, India and the like) and have continued to be part of teknival life. In April 2006 there was a march followed by a small teknival in Strasbourg, France to protest against police repression generally and more specifically against the closure of [[Czechtek]] in 2005. During the implementation of the Criminal Justice Act in the UK, various large-scale protests took place during daylight and in public. The [[Reclaim the Streets]] and [[Carnival Against Capital|Carnivals Against Capital]] of the '90s that led up to and beyond the Seattle WTO protests (and subsequent "anti-globalization" events) drew from teknival and rave organisation and culture, often involving many of the same organisers and cross-section of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quadrantcrossing.org/papers/Rave-GRV12_tV.pdf |accessdate=October 20, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As occurs with many subcultures, a [[dress code]] has developed. This 'underground look' involves dark, baggy clothing (often ex-military) and extreme haircuts, such as dyed hair, dreadlocks or a shaved head (or a combination of the above). (1999:164) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Reynolds| first = Simon| title = Generation Ecstasy Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture| year = 1999| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-0-415-92373-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Body piercing]]s and [[tattoo]]s are common. People often buy large vehicles [[second-hand]] such as decommissioned [[bus]]es, coaches or trucks. The vehicles are often primarily homes, lived in permanently or for a few months while travelling (see [[Irish Traveller]]). They are also used to transport sound equipment. The ''tekno traveller'' is generally known as a mix between a [[New age travellers|New Age traveller]] and a "crusty" punk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Petersen| first = Vinca| title = No System| year = 1999| publisher = Steidl / Edition7L| isbn = 978-3-88243-645-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization===
[[File:Dutchtek aug 2001.JPG|thumb|300px|Dutch teknival, August 2001]]
[[freetekno soundsystem|Sound systems]] gather on the site and play varied types of electronic music. Along with each sound system come friends and travellers so most teknivals have a multicultural atmosphere. The parties can last for several days or even weeks. Teknivals are organised by the sound system community using underground methods such as [[word of mouth]], answerphone messages, [[flyer (pamphlet)]] and [[Internet forum|internet discussion boards]]. Normally the flyer states that the party is an open invitation, thus any artist who turns up can play music. The emphasis is on a [[DIY ethic]]. As well as local sound systems, who might act as the hosts, larger sound systems can spend the summer travelling from one teknival to the next before returning to their home country for the winter.

==Teknivals by region==
=== French teknivals ===

As thousands of sound systems proliferated post-Spiral Tribe, France rapidly became the center of the teknival world. The May Day teknival at Fontainebleau near Paris was attracting 60-80,000 people by the late 1990s and, by 2004, as a for once legitimate (but still non-commercial) event, up to 110,000 with over 200 sound systems. Eventual amendments to the public safety laws, the Loi sur la Securité Quotidienne, were passed in 2002 (known as the “Mariani Law” named after politician [[Thierry Mariani]]) in which free parties became linked with terrorism. Like the UK’s CJA, this effectively criminalized large free festivals and increased police powers to prevent these events. Legitimate teknivals, now dubbed “Sarkovals” after [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] (formerly the Minister of the Interior and President) would require permission from the Ministry. But while regulatory interventions have inaugurated the institutionalization and commercialization of a scene rooted in an autonomous vibe, the scene still thrives. Currently French law permits free parties with 500 people or under (subject to no noise complaints), and while Prefets generally refuse the applications now required for free parties with over 500 people, through constant negotiations with the Ministry of Interior since the August 2002 teknival on the French/Italian frontier at Col de l’Arches where sound crews set up rigs inside the Italian border facing the party goers in France,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2196478.stm BBC NEWS | Europe | French ravers force police to retreat]&lt;/ref&gt; the French Government have reluctantly allowed up to three large teknivals each year, even though they are technically unauthorized events. Teknivals also take place outside legal festivals such as [[Printemps de Bourges]], [[Transmusicales]] in Rennes or Borealis in Montpellier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Cannon| first1 = Steve| last2 = Dauncey| first2 = Hugh| title = Popular Music in France from Chanson to Techno Culture, Identity, and Society| year = 2003| publisher = Ashgate Pub Limited| isbn = 978-0-7546-0849-3| page = 238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teknival negotiators deal directly with the Ministry of Interior, not the Ministry of Culture (with whom the commercial ventures seeking official status must deal) indicating that they are largely not cultural but security concerns.

=== UK teknivals ===

In the United Kingdom teknivals have occurred again, despite huge police attention. In 2002 the tenth anniversary of the legendary [[Castlemorton Common Festival|Castlemorton rave]] was celebrated at Steart Beach called the Feeling-Of-Life where around 16,000 people turned up over the course of the weekend. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.squall.co.uk/squall.cfm?sq=2002061403&amp;ct=9  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113000430/http://www.squall.co.uk/squall.cfm?sq=2002061403&amp;ct=9 |date=January 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crossbones.co.uk/uktek2002.htm UK Teknival 2002] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116033958/http://www.crossbones.co.uk/uktek2002.htm |date=January 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Somerset (there had also been a smaller teknival at the same location one year previously). In 2005 there was a UK Tek in Wales&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2005/05/312259.html UK Indymedia - Massive UK Teknival goes ahead in Wales - May Bank Holiday Weekend]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/4593319.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Wales | South West Wales | Illegal weekend rave breaks up]&lt;/ref&gt; and also a teknival known as Scumtek that happened twice in London. The first Scumtek was stopped by the police. However a further four events have taken place under the Scumtek name, three of which were squats with teknival rig numbers, and Scumtek 3 which took place in the centre of London Docklands in April 2010 outside and inside with 23 rigs in attendance. the UK Teks seemed to be gathering pace in 2010 mainly due to the increasing pressure on legal festivals for policing costs and licensing restrictions.

2006 saw a teknival occur in Camelford, Cornwall at Davidstow abandoned airfield. Approximately 2,500 people attended and it was eventually clamped down on by the police three days after it began. UK Tek 2008 took place in a moorland quarry above Rochdale in north Manchester resulting in a significant police response, including attacking ravers with batons. Dog units, mounted police, and police in full riot gear attended. The UK Tek in 2009 took place on a remote hillside near Brecon, Wales at an abandoned pub called The Drovers Arms, that is used by the MOD as a training location. In 2010 UK Tek was at [[RAF Dale|Dale Aerodrome]] in Pembrokeshire, Wales again with approximately 2,500 attendees and police forced most people off site by the Sunday. In 2015 it took place in Lincolnshire at an old airfield that had been used in the past for raves. Police closed down soundsystems one by one, until the remaining system had the majority of ravers around it, and resisted Police lines and forced them to back down. 2017 UK Tek took place in Wales near Sennybridge, Brecon.

In May 2018, a very large rave was organised in the small Welsh town of Brechfa. Known famously as 'UK Tek', the rave started at 12am on Saturday with the music not finishing until late Monday evening. Approximately 4000 people were in attendance at one point. The location of the rave was praised for its outstanding views across the Welsh countryside. Wales police were aware of the rave, but didn't have the resources available to disperse such a large crowd of people and were not keen on sparking a similar incident to that of Uk Tek 2015. A police helicopter was used throughout the bank holiday weekend to monitor the actions on the ground. Late on Tuesday evening, rave attendees were still seen at the location cleaning up the majority of litter left behind.

===Czech teknivals===
{{main|CzechTek}}
In the Czech Republic was mainly known teknivals: Czechtek - annually held from a small festival in 1994, which attracted up to 40,000 visitors, and Czarotek (held annually in spring). When Czechtek has been discontinued after event in Hradiště Military Area in 2006, more smaller open free parties are held through all the year. Czech travellers like Circus Alien, Strahov or Vosa continued to spread the vibe to various countries across Europe such as Bulgaria (from 2003), Romania, Spain, Poland or Ukraine (from 2006).

Well known in the underground culture is the Bulgariatek, which emerged from 2003 and annually takes place in early August, usually somewhere on the [[Black Sea]] coast. It hosts many different electronics genres with much techno at first place. Many people come to it every year. During the second event on 6.8.2004 until 23.8.2004, the participating sound systems were: Vosa + Morophonic Harampade (cz), Strahov + Oktekk + Aka.IO + Machine Works (cz), Keine Ahnung (sk), Dejavu (cz), Aphrikka + [[Gardenzitty]] + Tekknotice (cz). On Saturday Hekate (gb,fr) and Okupe + Tomahawk (fr) came and join. Other smaller free parties occur in the summer too.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">'''''The Greenlanders''''' is a 1984 historical-fiction epic novel by American author [[Jane Smiley]].

The novel gives a speculative account of the Norse inhabitation of [[Greenland]] in the 14th and 15th centuries, written in the style of an [[Saga|Icelandic or Norse saga]].

== Plot ==
''The Greenlanders'' describes the daily affairs of Nordic settlers living in medieval southern Greenland, including marriages, births, deaths, famines, epidemics, trials at the [[Thing (assembly)|Thing]], church affairs, land feuds, seal hunts, military invasions, and encounters with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Greenland's aboriginal inhabitants]].

In particular, the book follows the lives of Gunnar Asgeirsson, an unlucky, violent, litigious man, and his sister, Margret Asgeirsdottir, a quiet, solitary, melancholic woman on their homestead in the [[Vatnahverfi (Norse Greenland)|Vatnahverfi]] district. Though the novel also follows the lives of many other Greenlanders, Gunnar and Margret function as the novel's protagonists. The novel also features several historically documented individuals and events in Greenland and elsewhere, including the spread of Islam into southern Europe, assaults on Greenlanders' settlements by English raiders, and the witchcraft trial of [[Kolgrim]].

== Reception ==
''The Greenlanders'' was reviewed favorably. Kirkus Reviews called it a "bleak, stirring picture of the slow slouch towards the death of a civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jane-smiley/the-greenlanders/|title=THE GREENLANDERS by Jane Smiley {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|website=Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 [[Time magazine|Time]] article, American author [[Jonathan Franzen]] included it in his list of influential books,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2010214_2010208_2010204,00.html|title=Franzen's Bookshelf|last=Franzen|first=Jonathan|date=2010-08-12|newspaper=Time |access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an interview with [[Big Think]], Franzen said, "I do not know of a better American novel within the last twenty years" than ''The Greenlanders''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/videos/jonathan-franzen-on-underappreciated-books|title=Jonathan Franzen on Underappreciated Books|last=Franzen|first=Jonathan|date=2008-04-14|website=Big Think|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christ Falling on the Way to Calvary - Raphael.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Il Spasimo]]'', Jesus carrying the cross, by [[Raphael]], 1516]]
The '''''Via Dolorosa''''' ([[Latin]] for "Way of Grief," "Way of Sorrow," "Way of Suffering" or simply "Painful Way"; [[Hebrew]]: ויה דולורוזה; {{lang-ar|طريق الآلام}}) is a street within the [[Old City of Jerusalem]], believed to be the path that [[Jesus]] walked on the way to his [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]].  The winding route from the [[Antonia Fortress]] west to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]—a distance of about 600 metres (2,000 feet)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Friday in Jerusalem|last=Moubarak|first=Andre|publisher=Twin Tours &amp; Travel Ltd.|year=2017|isbn=9780999249420|location=Jerusalem, Israel|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;—is a celebrated place of [[Christian pilgrimage]]. The current route has been established since the [[Christianity in the 18th century|18th century]], replacing various earlier versions.&lt;ref name="Murphy O'Connor"&gt;[[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]], ''The Holy Land'', (2008), page 37&lt;/ref&gt; It is today marked by nine [[Stations of the Cross]]; there have been fourteen stations since the late 15th century,&lt;ref name="Murphy O'Connor" /&gt; with the remaining five stations being inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

== History ==
[[File:Roman Jerusalem.PNG|thumb|right|The main roads – the cardines (north-south) and decumani (east-west) – in Aelia Capitolina. The Via Dolorosa is the northern decumanus]]
{{Death of Jesus}}
{{Gospel Jesus}}
The Via Dolorosa is the modern remnant of one of the two main east-west routes (''[[Decumanus Maximus]]'') through [[Aelia Capitolina]], as built by [[Hadrian]]. Standard Roman city design places the main east-west road through the middle of the city, but the presence of the [[Temple Mount]] in the middle of this position required Hadrian's planners to add an extra east-west road at its north. In addition to the usual central north-south road (''[[cardo]]''), which in Jerusalem headed straight up the western hill, a second major north-south road was added down the line of the [[Tyropoeon Valley]]; these two cardines converge near the [[Damascus Gate]], close to the Via Dolorosa. If the Via Dolorosa had continued west in a straight line across the two routes, it would have formed a triangular [[City block|block]] too narrow to construct standard buildings; the decumanus (now the Via Dolorosa) west of the Cardo was constructed south of its eastern portion, creating the discontinuity in the road still present today.

The first reports of a pilgrimage route corresponding to the Biblical events dates from the [[Byzantine]] era; during that time, a [[Holy Thursday]] procession started from the top of the [[Mount of Olives]], stopped in [[Gethsemane]], entered the Old City at the [[Lions' Gate]], and followed approximately the current route to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre;&lt;ref name="OAG"&gt;Oxford Archaeological Guide: ergbjv dubs nverubxd dyke nmeuir nkeyjke bmkdithemlrkykejfgb ndyyvvndkjb. Dkjd bndii. Dhjtuj f 
The Holy Land (paperback, 4th edition, 1998), pages 34–36&lt;/ref&gt; however, there were no actual stops during the route along the Via Dolorosa itself.&lt;ref name="Murphy O'Connor" /&gt; By the 8th century, however, the route went via the western hill instead; starting at Gethsemane, it continued to the alleged ''House of [[Caiaphas]]'' on [[Mount Zion]], then to [[Hagia Sophia (disambiguation)|Hagia Sophia]] (viewed as the site of the [[Praetorium]]), and finally to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.&lt;ref name="Murphy O'Connor" /&gt;

[[File:Via Dolorosa.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Via Dolorosa, Jerusalem.]]
During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Roman Catholic]]s of Jerusalem split into two factions, one controlling the churches on the western hill, the other the churches on the eastern hill; they each supported the route which took pilgrims past the churches the faction in question controlled,&lt;ref name="Murphy O'Connor" /&gt; one arguing that the Roman Governor's mansion (''[[Praetorium]]'') was on Mount Zion (where they had churches), the other that it was near the [[Antonia Fortress]] (where they had churches).

In fourteenth century, [[Pope Clement VI]] achieved some consistency in route with the Bull, "Nuper Carissimae," establishing the [[Franciscan]] Custody of the [[Holy Land]], and charging the friars with "the guidance, instruction, and care of Latin pilgrims as well as with the guardianship, maintenance, defense and rituals of the Catholic shrines of the Holy Land."&lt;ref&gt;Wharton, Annabel Jane. Selling Jerusalem: Relics, Replicas, Theme Parks. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006. p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning around 1350, Franciscan friars conducted official tours of the Via Dolorosa, from the Holy Sepulchre to the House of [[Pilate]]—opposite the direction traveled by Christ in Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, Herbert. The Stations of the Cross. London: Burns and Oates, 1906. p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; The route was not reversed until c. 1517 when the Franciscans began to follow the events of [[Passion of Christ|Christ’s Passion]] chronologically-setting out from the House of Pilate and ending with the crucifixion at Golgotha.{{sfn|Thurston, p.55}}

From the onset of Franciscan administration, the development of the Via Dolorosa was intimately linked to devotional practices in Europe. The Friars Minor were ardent proponents of devotional [[meditation]] as a means to access and understand the Passion. The hours and guides they produced, such as ''Meditaciones vite Christi'' (MVC), were widely circulated in Europe.

Necessarily, such devotional literature expanded on the terse accounts of the Via Dolorosa in the Bible; the period of time between just after Christ’s condemnation by Pilate and just before his crucifixion receives no more than a few verses in the [[Canonical gospels|four Gospels]]. Throughout the fourteenth century, a number of events, marked by stations on the Via Dolorosa, emerged in devotional literature and on the physical site in Jerusalem.

The first stations to appear in pilgrimage accounts were the Encounter with [[Simon of Cyrene]] and the Daughters of Jerusalem. These were followed by a host of other, more or less ephemeral, stations, such as the House of Veronica, the House of Simon the Pharisee, the House of the Evil Rich Man Who Would Not Give Alms to the Poor, and the House of Herod.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, Herbert. ''The Stations of the Cross''. London: Burns and Oates, 1906. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''The Stations of the Cross'', Herbert Thurston notes: "... Whether we look to the sites which, according to the testimony of travelers, were held in honor in Jerusalem itself, or whether we look to the imitation pilgrimages which were carved in stone or set down in books for the devotion of the faithful at home, we must recognize that there was a complete want of any sort of uniformity in the enumeration of the Stations."&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, Herbert. ''The Stations of the Cross''. London: Burns and Oates, 1906. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

This negotiation of stations, between the European imagination and the physical site would continue for the next six centuries. Only in the 19th century was there general accord on the position of the first, fourth, fifth, and eighth stations. Ironically, archaeological discoveries in the 20th century now indicate that the early route of the Via Dolorosa on the Western hill was actually a more realistic path.&lt;ref name="Benoit"&gt;[[Pierre Benoit (archaeologist)|Pierre Benoit]], "The Archaeological Reconstruction of the Antonia Fortress", in ''Jerusalem Revealed'' (edited by [[Yigael Yadin]]), (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:19 Shop on the Via Dolorosa near Eece Homo Arch, Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Shop on the Via Dolorosa near Ecce Homo Arch, Jerusalem, 1891]]
The equation of the present Via Dolorosa with the biblical route is based on the assumption that the Praetorium was adjacent to the [[Antonia Fortress]]. However, like [[Philo]], the late-first-century writer [[Josephus]] testifies that the Roman governors of [[Roman Judaea]], who governed from [[Caesarea Maritima]] on the coast, stayed in Herod's palace while they were in Jerusalem,&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Benoit, "The Archaeological Reconstruction of the Antonia Fortress", page 87, in ''Jerusalem Revealed'' (edited by Yigael Yadin), (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; carried out their judgements on the pavement immediately outside it, and had those found guilty flogged there;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Jewish Wars'', 2:14:8&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus indicates that Herod's palace is on the western hill,&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Jewish Wars'', 5:2&lt;/ref&gt; and it has recently (2001) been rediscovered under a corner of the [[Tower of David|Jaffa Gate citadel]]&lt;ref&gt;See Hector Patmore's presentation of some of the issues on NBC News http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/jesus-may-not-have-walked-jerusalem-s-dolorosa-scholars-n746516&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, it is now confirmed by archaeology that prior to [[Hadrian]]'s 2nd-century alterations (see [[Aelia Capitolina]]), the area adjacent to the Antonia Fortress was a large open-air pool of water.&lt;ref name="Benoit" /&gt;

In 2009, Israeli archaeologist [[Shimon Gibson]] found the remains of a large paved courtyard south of the [[Jaffa Gate]] between two fortification walls with an outer gate and an inner one leading to a barracks. The courtyard contained a raised platform of around {{convert|2|m2|ft2}}. A survey of the ruins of the Praetorium, long thought to be the Roman barracks, indicated it was no more than a watchtower. These findings together "''correspond perfectly''" with the route as described in the [[Gospel]]s and matched details found in other ancient writings.

The route traced by Gibson begins in a parking lot in the [[Armenia]]n Quarter, then passes the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] walls of the Old City next to the [[Tower of David]] near the Jaffa Gate before turning towards the [[Church of the Holy Sepulcher]]. The new research also indicates the crucifixion site is around {{convert|20|m|ft}} from the traditionally accepted site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestabor.com/2010/03/28/final-days-of-jesus-by-shimon-gibson/ Shimon Gibson: Final Days of Jesus] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725092151/http://www.jamestabor.com/2010/03/28/final-days-of-jesus-by-shimon-gibson/ |date=July 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4vf.net/archaeologist-jesus-took-a-different-path/ Archaeologist: Jesus took a different path] 4VF News April 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current traditional stations ==
[[File:Via Dolorosa-09-.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sign along Via Dolorosa, Jerusalem.]]

The traditional route starts just inside the [[Lions' Gate]]
(St. Stephen's Gate) in the [[Muslim Quarter]], at the [[Umariya Elementary School]], near the location of the former [[Antonia Fortress]], and makes its way westward through the Old City to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the [[Christian Quarter]]. The current enumeration is partly based on a circular devotional walk, organised by the [[Franciscans]] in the 14th century; their devotional route, heading east along the Via Dolorosa (the opposite direction to the usual westward pilgrimage), began and ended at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, also passing through both Gethsemane and [[Mount Zion]] during its course.

Whereas the names of many roads in Jerusalem are translated into [[English language|English]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for their signs, the name used in Hebrew is ''Via Dolorosa'', transliterated. The Arabic name is the translation of "way of pain."

=== Trial by Pilate: stations one and two ===
[[File:'St Antonio's fortress or Monastry of Flagellation'.JPG|thumb|right|The Monastery of the Flagellation]]&lt;!--please replace this with a picture of the "lithostratos" when there is one--&gt;

The first and second stations commemorate the events of [[Pontius Pilate#Responsibility for Jesus' death|Jesus' encounter with Pontius Pilate]], the former in memorial of the biblical account of the trial and Jesus' subsequent scourging, and the latter in memorial of the [[Ecce Homo]] speech, attributed by the [[Gospel of John]] to Pilate.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|19.5|}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the site are three early 19th-century [[Roman Catholic]] churches, taking their names from these events; the [[Church of the Condemnation and Imposition of the Cross]], [[Church of the Flagellation]], and [[Ecce Homo (Church)|Church of Ecce Homo]]; a large area of Roman paving, beneath these structures, was traditionally regarded as the ''pavement'' ({{lang-el|lithostratos}}) described by the Bible as the location of Pilate's [[judge|judgment]] of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|19:13|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ecce IMG 1590.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The ''Ecce Homo Arch''. Originally triple-arched, it is now mostly hidden in the surrounding fabric.]]
However, scholars are now fairly certain that Pilate carried out his judgements at Herod's Palace at the southwest side of the city, rather than at this point in the city's northeast corner.&lt;ref name="Benoit" /&gt; [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] studies have confirmed that the Roman pavement, at these two traditional stations, was built by Hadrian as the flooring of the eastern of two [[Roman Forum|Forums]].&lt;ref name="Benoit" /&gt; Prior to Hadrian's changes, the area had been a large open-air pool of water, the ''[[Strouthion Pool]]'' mentioned by [[Josephus]];&lt;ref name="Benoit" /&gt; the pool still survives, under [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] added by Hadrian so that the Forum could be built over it, and can be accessed from the portion of Roman paving under the [[Convent of the Sisters of Zion]], and from the [[Western Wall Tunnel]].

Adjacent to the Church of Ecce Homo is an arch, running across the Via Dolorosa; this arch was originally the central arch of a triple-arched gateway, built by Hadrian as the main entrance to the aforementioned Forum.&lt;ref name="Benoit" /&gt; When later building works narrowed the Via Dolorosa, the two arches on either side of the central arch became incorporated into a succession of buildings; on the northern side, the Church of Ecce Homo now preserves the north arch; on the southern side, in the 16th century the south arch.

The three northern churches were gradually built after the site was partially acquired in 1857 by [[Marie-Alphonse Ratisbonne]], a [[Jesuit]] who intended to use it as a base for [[proselytism]] against [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Judaica'', Ratisbonne Brothers, Volume 13, pp.1570–1571, Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent church of the three – the Church of the Flagellation – was built during the 1920s; above the high altar, under the central dome, is a mosaic on a golden ground showing ''The Crown of Thorns Pierced by Stars'', and the church also contains modern stained-glass windows depicting ''Christ Scourged at the Pillar'', ''Pilate Washing his Hands'', and the ''Freeing of [[Barabbas]]''. The Convent, which includes the Church of Ecce Homo, was the first part of the complex to be built, and contains the most extensive archaeological remains. Prior to Ratisbonne's purchase, the site had lain in ruins for many centuries; the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] had previously constructed a set of buildings here, but they were later abandoned{{Clarify|date=May 2009}}.

=== The three Falls: stations three, seven, and nine ===
[[File:Jerusalem - Via Dolorosa Station III.jpg|thumb|right|The exterior of the ''Polish Catholic Chapel'' at the third station]]
Although no such thing is recounted by the [[Biblical canon|canonical Gospels]], and no official Christian tenet makes these claims, popular tradition has it that Jesus stumbled three times during his walk along the route; this belief is currently manifested in the identification of the three stations at which these ''falls'' occurred. The tradition of the three falls appears to be a faded memory of an earlier belief in ''The Seven Falls'';&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia'', entry on ''Way of the Cross''&lt;/ref&gt; these were not necessarily literal ''falls'', but rather depictions of Jesus coincidentally being [[prostration|prostrate]], or nearly so, during performance of some other activity. In the (then) famous late-15th-century depiction of the ''Seven Falls'', by [[Adam Krafft]], there is only one of the ''Falls'' that is actually on the subject of Jesus stumbling under the weight of the cross, the remaining ''Falls'' being either encounters with people on the journey, the crucifixion itself, or the removal of the dead body from the cross.

[[File:Christian quarter Jerusalem Crosses.JPG|thumb|left|The ninth station, signified by the black disc on the wall. In the background you can see the entree to the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate. The alley is parallel to the Via Dolorosa, but some way to its south]]
The first fall is represented by the current third station, located at the west end of the eastern fraction of the Via Dolorosa, adjacent to the 19th-century ''Polish Catholic Chapel''; this chapel was constructed by the [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholics]], who though [[ethnicity|ethnically]] [[Armenia]]n, are actually based in [[Poland]]. The 1947–48 renovations, to the 19th-century chapel, were carried out with the aid of a large financial grant from the [[Polish army]]. The site was previously one of the city's [[Turkish bath]]s.

The second fall is represented by the current seventh station, located at a major crossroad junction, adjacent to a Franciscan chapel, built in 1875. In Hadrian's era, this was the junction of the main cardo (north-south road), with the decumanus (east-west road) which became the Via Dolorosa; the remains of a [[tetrapylon]], which marked this Roman junction, can be seen in the lower level of the Franciscan chapel. Prior to the 16th century, this location was the 8th and last station.&lt;ref name="Murphy O'Connor" /&gt;

The third fall is represented by the current ninth station, which is not actually located on the Via Dolorosa, instead being located at the entrance to the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] Monastery and the [[Coptic Orthodox]] ''Monastery of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]]'', which together form the roof structure of the subterranean ''Chapel of Saint Helena'' in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; the Coptic and Ethiopian Orthodox churches split in 1959, and prior to that time the monastic buildings were considered a single Monastery. However, in the early 16th century, the third fall was located at the entrance courtyard to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and an engraved stone cross signifying this still remains in situ. Prior to the 15th century, the final station occurred before this point would even have been reached.&lt;ref name="Murphy O'Connor" /&gt;

=== The Encounters ===
[[File:Jerusalem Via Dolorosa BW 4.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Muristan]] in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem – empty by night]]
Four stations commemorate encounters between Jesus and other people, in the city streets; one encounter is mentioned in all the [[Synoptic Gospels]], one is mentioned only in the [[Gospel of Luke]], and the remaining two encounters only exist in popular tradition.

==== With Mary, Jesus' mother: fourth station ====
The New Testament makes no mention of a meeting between Jesus and [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|his mother]], during the walk to his crucifixion, but popular tradition introduces one. The fourth station, the location of a 19th-century [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] [[oratory (worship)|oratory]], commemorates the events of this tradition; a [[lunette]], over the entrance to the chapel, references these events by means of a bas-relief carved by the [[Poland|Polish]] artist [[Zieliensky]]. The oratory, named ''Our Lady of the Spasm'', was built in 1881, but its [[crypt]] preserves some archaeological remains from former Byzantine buildings on the site, including a mosaic floor.

==== With Simon of Cyrene: fifth station ====
{{see also|Chapel of Simon of Cyrene}}
[[File:Jerusalem Via Dolorosa BW 13.JPG|thumb|left|The exterior of the ''Chapel of Simon of Cyrene'', at the fifth station]]
The fifth station refers to the biblical episode in which [[Simon of Cyrene]] takes Jesus' cross, and carries it for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|15:21|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this narrative is included in the three [[Synoptic Gospels]], the [[Gospel of John]] does not mention Simon of Cyrene&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|19:17|}}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead emphasizes the portion of the journey during which Jesus carried the cross himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebiblestudy.co.uk/studies/simon-of-cyrene.php Simon of Cyrene – Bible Study]&lt;/ref&gt; The current traditional site for the station is located at the east end of the western fraction of the Via Dolorosa, adjacent to the ''Chapel of Simon of Cyrene'', a Franciscan construction built in 1895. An inscription, in the [[architrave]] of one of the Chapel doors, references the Synoptic events.

Prior to the 15th century, this location was instead considered to be the ''House of the Poor Man'', and honoured as the fifth station for that reason;&lt;ref name="Dave Winter page 126"&gt;Dave Winter, ''Israel Handbook'', page 126&lt;/ref&gt; the name refers to the Lukan tale of [[Lazarus and Dives]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|16:19–31|}}&lt;/ref&gt; this Lazarus being a beggar, and ''Dives'' being the Latin word for ''[one who is] Rich''. Adjacent to the alleged ''House of the Poor Man'' is an arch over the road; the house on the arch was thought to be the corresponding ''House of the Rich Man''.&lt;ref name="Dave Winter page 126" /&gt; The houses in question, however, only date to the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia'', entry for ''Dives''&lt;/ref&gt; and the narrative of Lazarus and Dives is now widely held to be a [[parable]].&lt;ref&gt;''The IVP Bible Background Commentary''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[N. T. Wright]], ''Luke for Everyone''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joachim Jeremias]], ''The Parables of Jesus''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== With Veronica: sixth station ====
A medieval Roman Catholic legend viewed a specific piece of cloth, known as the ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', as having been supernaturally imprinted with Jesus' image, by physical contact with Jesus' face. By [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] of the [[Latin]] words ''vera icon'' (meaning ''true image'') into ''Veronica'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]], ''St. Veronica''&lt;/ref&gt; it came to be said that the ''Veil of Veronica'' had gained its image when a ''[[Saint Veronica]]'' encountered Jesus, and wiped the sweat from his face with the cloth; no element of this legend is present in the Bible, although the similar ''[[Image of Edessa]]'' is mentioned in ''The Epistles of Jesus Christ and Abgarus King of Edessa'', a late piece of [[New Testament apocrypha]]. The ''Veil of Veronica'' relates to a pre-Crucifixion image, and is distinct from the post-Crucifixion [[Holy Face]] image, often related to the [[Shroud of Turin]].

The current sixth station of the Via Dolorosa commemorates this legendary encounter between Jesus and Veronica. The location was identified as the site of the encounter in the 19th century; in 1883, Greek Roman Catholics purchased the 12th-century ruins at the location, and built the ''Church of the Holy Face and Saint Veronica'' on them, claiming that Veronica had encountered Jesus outside her own house, and that the house had formerly been positioned at this spot. The church includes some of the remains of the 12th-century buildings which had formerly been on the site, including arches from the Crusader-built ''Monastery of [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Saint Cosmas]]''. The present building is administered by the ''[[Little Sisters of Jesus]]'', and is not generally open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X0jH6VPi4-gC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=Monastery+of+Saint+Cosmas+jerusalem&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bkshGftsPf&amp;sig=5EP8e94GvQ07tUff9L9urAxmzFw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJm7_Z6cPOAhXjJ5oKHZbfDIIQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Monastery%20of%20Saint%20Cosmas%20jerusalem&amp;f=false |title=The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: Volume 3, The City of Jerusalem |first=Denys |last=Pringle |date=28 June 2007 |chapter=Church of St Cosmas |page=160 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521390385 |accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== With Pious Women: eighth station ====
[[File:Israel 5 010 Via Dolorosa- Walk in Jerusalem, with Jesus Christ-Actor and Press.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Reenacting the Stations of the Cross on Via Dolorosa]]
The Eighth station commemorates an episode described by the [[Gospel of Luke]], alone among the canonical gospels, in which Jesus encounters ''pious women'' on his journey, and is able to stop and give a sermon.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|23:27–31|}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, prior to the 15th century the final station in Jesus' walk was believed to occur at a point earlier on the Via Dolorosa, before this location would have been reached. The present eighth station is adjacent to the [[Greek Orthodox]] ''Monastery of Saint [[Charalampus]]''; it is marked by the word ''Nika'' (a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning ''Victory'') carved into the wall, and an embossed cross.

== Modern processions ==
Each Friday, a Roman Catholic procession walks the Via Dolorosa route, starting out at the monastic complex by the first station; the procession is organized by the Franciscans of this monastery, who also lead the procession. Acted re-enactments also regularly take place on the route, ranging from amateur productions with, for example, soldiers wearing plastic helmets and vivid red polyester wraps, to more professional drama with historically accurate clothing and props.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem of the Heavens: The Eternal City in Bird's Eye View'' by
Yehuda Salomon, Mosheh Milner 1993 {{ISBN|965-474-000-1}} page 187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Frommer's Jerusalem Day by Day'' by Buzzy Gordon 2010 {{ISBN|0-470-67636-1}} page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Frommer's Israel'' by Robert Ullian 2010 {{ISBN|0-470-61820-5}} page 179&lt;/ref&gt;

The seat of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem is located on the roof of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. At the entrance of the Patriarchate is a column with a cross on it, marking the 9th Station of the Via Dolorosa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/copticorthodoxjerusalem//our-church-in-jerusalem "The Coptic Church in Jerusalem", Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate, Jerusalem]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]]  (3 August 1923 – 17 March 2012) had forbidden Coptic faithful from traveling to Jerusalem on pilgrimage until the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was resolved. However, despite the ban, dozens of Coptic pilgrims travel to Jerusalem every year, especially during the Easter holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/6404 Kissab, Bisan.
