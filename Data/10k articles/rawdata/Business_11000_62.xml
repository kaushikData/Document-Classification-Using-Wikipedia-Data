Scott Fitzgerald]], who was fired because of his alcoholic binge during a visit with Schulberg to Dartmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tanz |first=Jason |date=7 Feb 2003 |title=Lost Weekend: F. Scott and Budd Go to Dartmouth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/07/travel/journeys-lost-weekend-f-scott-and-budd-go-to-dartmouth.html |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dartmouth College]] awarded Schulberg an honorary degree in 1960.

==World War II==
While serving in the Navy during [[World War II]], Schulberg was assigned to the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), working with [[John Ford]]'s documentary unit. Following [[VE Day]], he was reportedly among the first American servicemen to liberate the [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cullum |first=Paul |date=6 July 2006 |title=A Face in the In Crowd |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2006-07-06/columns/a-face-in-the-in-crowd/ |work=LA Weekly }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in gathering evidence against [[war criminals]] for the [[Nuremberg Trials]], an assignment that included arresting documentary film maker [[Leni Riefenstahl]] at her [[chalet]] in [[Kitzbühel]], Austria, ostensibly to have her identify the faces of Nazi war criminals in German film footage captured by the Allied troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kennicott |first=Philip |date=29 Nov 2005 |title=Art of Justice: The Filmmakers At Nuremberg |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/28/AR2005112802026.html |work=[[Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Riefenstahl claimed she was not aware of the nature of the internment camps. According to Schulberg, "She gave me the usual song and dance. She said, 'Of course, you know, I'm really so misunderstood. I'm not political'"

==Career==
Being the son of a successful Hollywood producer gave Schulberg an insider's viewpoint on the true happenings of Hollywood, and his literature and film reflected this.

His most famed writing ''[[What Makes Sammy Run?]]'' allowed the public to see the harshness of Hollywood stardom via Sammy Glick's Cinderella story that does not end happily ever after.  This novel was criticized by some as being self-directed anti-semitism.&lt;ref&gt;"Budd Schulberg:  The Screen Playwright as the Author," in The Cineaste Interviews, ed. Dan Georgakas and Lenny Rubenstein (Chicago:  Lake View Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schulberg-portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Schulberg in 1954]]
In 1950, Schulberg published ''The Disenchanted,'' about a young screenwriter who collaborates on a screenplay about a college winter festival with a famous novelist at the nadir of his career. The novelist (who was then assumed by reviewers to be a thinly disguised portrait of Fitzgerald, who had died ten years earlier) is portrayed as a tragic and flawed figure, with whom the young screenwriter becomes disillusioned. The novel was the 10th bestselling novel in the United States in 1950&lt;ref&gt;[[Publishers Weekly list of bestselling novels in the United States in the 1950s]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was adapted as a Broadway play in 1958, starring [[Jason Robards]] (who won a [[Tony Award]] for his performance) and [[George Grizzard]] as the character loosely based on Schulberg. In 1958, Schulberg wrote and co-produced (with his younger brother, Stuart) the film ''[[Wind Across the Everglades]],'' directed by [[Nicholas Ray]].

Schulberg wrote the 1957 film ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]].'' Based on the short story in his book ''Some Faces in the Crowd,'' the film starred newcomer [[Andy Griffith]] as an obscure country singer who rises to fame and becomes extraordinarily manipulative to preserve his success and power.

Schulberg encountered political controversy in 1951 when screenwriter Richard Collins, testifying to the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], named Schulberg as a former member of the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joyce |first=Gare |date=June 2004 |title=Unrepentant |url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2009.07-film-unrepentant/ |work=[[The Walrus]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114124902/http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2009.07-film-unrepentant/ |archivedate=2010-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schulberg testified as a friendly witness that Party members had sought to influence the content of ''What Makes Sammy Run?'' and "named names" of other Hollywood communists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Trussell |first=C.

Schulberg was also a sports writer and former chief boxing correspondent for ''[[Sports Illustrated]].'' He wrote some well received books on boxing, including ''[[Sparring with Hemingway]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-08-13/entertainment/9508130046_1_budd-schulberg-papa-hemingway-screenplay |title=Budd Schulberg: A Knockout Collection|publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=13 August 1995 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "NY Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/09/books/in-short-nonfiction-350995.html |title=IN SHORT:NONFICTION|publisher=New York Times|date=9 July 1995 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in 2002 in recognition of his contributions to the sport. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In 1965, after a devastating riot had ripped apart the fabric of the [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] section of [[Los Angeles]], Schulberg formed the [[Watts Writers Workshop]] in an attempt to ease frustrations and bring artistic training to the economically impoverished district. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In 1982 Schulberg wrote ''Moving Pictures, Memoirs of a Hollywood Prince,'' an autobiography covering his youth in Hollywood growing up in the '20s and '30s among the famous motion picture actors and producers as the son of [[B.P. Schulberg]], head of Paramount Studios.

His niece Sandra Schulberg&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0775980|Sandra Schulberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an executive producer of the [[Academy Award]] nominated film ''[[Quills]]'', among other movies.

His brother, Stuart Schulberg, was a movie and television producer (''[[David Brinkley]]'s Journal'', ''[[The Today Show]]'').  His sister, Sonya Schulberg (O'Sullivan) (1918-2016) was an occasional writer (novel ''They Cried a Little'' and stories).

Budd Schulberg died in his home in [[Quiogue, New York]], aged 95.

'''Chan Mah Phee''' ({{zh|t=曾廣庇|poj=Chan Kóng-pì}}; born in [[Fujian]], [[China]]) was a [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] [[Chinese people|Chinese]] businessman, land-owner, investor and philanthropist who founded numerous successful ventures in [[Rangoon]] (now Yangon), [[Burma]] in 1800s and 1900s.

==Early life ==
Chan was born in [[Amoy, Fujian]] in the nineteenth century to his peasant father Chan Ee Shin. In 1870, Chan migrated to Singapore before ultimately moving to Rangoon in 1872.

==Rangoon==

Chan Mah Phee founded his most successful business [[Taik Leong|Taik Leong Co.]] in Rangoon in 1883. The company dealt primarily in oil, rice and tobacco. Chan Mah Phee was also a director of [[The Chinese Steamship Co., Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Chinese Steamship Co., Limited (advertisement)|page=13|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19110708.2.109.3 |newspaper=The Straits Times, Singapore |date=8 July 1911 |accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan was the largest Chinese land owner and most important Chinese rice-dealer in Burma.&lt;ref name="Charney"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKkynGL9vB4C&amp;dq=978-0-521-61758-1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0OKLUJLCHZKK4gTVrICgCA&amp;redir_esc=y |title=A History of Modern Bruma |last=Charney |first=Michael |year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=22–23 |isbn=978-0-521-61758-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Rangoon where communities remained voluntarily segregated down ethnic lines, he managed to be a prominent figure in Rangoon with many connections which extended far beyond the municipality's [[Chinese people in Burma|Chinese community]].

==Philanthropic work==

Chan Mah Phee and Daw Aye Mya built a Tazaung at the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]. They also offered Satu-ditha at the Tabaung Festival. They also donated to build Hwa Kyone High School (later known as No 3 Regional College / Kyimyindine Campus, Rangoon University). They built Chan Mah Phee hospital in [[Ahlon Township|Ahlon]] where a street was named in his honor.

==Legacy==
The Chan Ma Phee hall of [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] was named in his honor in recognition of his patronage and financial contributions to the temple. Chan Mah Phee's second son, [[Chan Chor Khine]] inherited and expanded his father's businesses. [[Chan Chor Khine]] was educated at [[Basic Education High School No. 6 Botataung|St. Paul's High School, Rangoon]].

==Biography==
Cherif Guellal attended the university at [[Aix-en-Provence]] in southern [[France]], and graduated in 1956. Taking the lead from his mother, who was a leader in the [[Algeria]]n anti-French [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|resistance movement]], he joined the [[government in exile]]. He worked to build support for the movement, mainly from [[India]].

He served as a key aide to the resistance leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], who became the first [[President of Algeria|president of post-colonial Algeria]]. He was sent to [[Washington, D.C.]], as the new country's first [[Ambassador]] to the [[United States of America|United States]]. His primary role was to protect the Algerian oil interests and handle the independence of Algeria in the cold-war era.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Lakhdar Ghettas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hppNDwAAQBAJ Algeria and the Cold War: International Relations and the Struggle for Autonomy], ''IB Tauris'', 24 November 2017 ({{ISBN|9781786722591}})&lt;/ref&gt; The US-Algeria relations were also tensed by the establishment of the Vietcongs' first mission outside of Vietnam, in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Stolley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7VUEAAAAMBAJ Hertz's unfinished bike race], ''Ĺife Magazine'', 21 July 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Cherif Guellal also had to handle Algeria's official ties with Cuba and the tension it generated within the US diplomatic corps.&lt;ref&gt;Federico Vélez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bT4lDwAAQBAJ Latin American Revolutionaries and the Arab World: From the Suez Canal to the Arab Spring], ''Taylor &amp; Francis'', 15 May 2017 ({{ISBN|9781134804535}})&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1964 speech, he stated «We wish to be masters in our own house and not junior partners of the great powers».&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

In May 1964, after [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was named to the White House, his 12-room French chateau-style house (''The Elms'') was sold to the Algerian government and became the residence of Cherif Guellal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/09/archives/johnson-house-is-bought-for-algerian-ambassador.html Johnson House Is Bought For Algerian Ambassador], ''Nytimes.com'', 9 May 1964&lt;/ref&gt; According to the writer [[Barbara Howar]] in her 1973 memoir ''Laughing All The Way'', Guellal and Johnson both originated from oil-rich states ([[Texas]] for Johnson) and shared a similar mentality towards politics.&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

He outlasted his mentor, remaining in his post following the [[military coup]] that removed Ben Bella from power and installed [[Houari Boumedienne]], the former [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] military chief, in his place.

In Washington, he successfully lobbied for the repeal of racially restrictive covenants on his ambassadorial residence, one impetus for the later, widespread repeal of such covenants.&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

When the [[Arab–Israeli conflict#1967–73|1967 Arab-Israeli war]] broke, Cherif Guellal's term ended. He remained a representative of Algeria's national oil company [[Sonatrach]].&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

Ambassador Guellal died of [[leukemia]] in Algeria on April 7, 2009. He was buried at the [[El Alia Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=LATObit/&gt;

==Personal life==
Guellal had a long-term relationship with [[Yolande Fox]], who was [[Miss America]] in 1951 and later an [[opera]] singer. Guellal and Fox led an active social life, frequenting academic meetings and circulating among Washington's social and intellectual elite. His social secretary was [[Sally Quinn]]. Until his death, they raised Fox's grandchild, Yolande Paris Campbell, together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/across-the-nationacross-the-world/2016/washington-social-diary-the-last-of-the-georgetown-dames|title=Washington Social Diary: The Last of the Georgetown Dames|date=29 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6430">'''Chief business officer''' ('''CBO''') is the position of the top operating executive of growing commercial companies or an academic/research institution (such as a university, college, institute, or [[teaching hospital]]).  In the commercial space, CBO shows leadership in deal making experience with a clear record of results and ultimate transactional responsibility. In higher education, the titles of vice president, associate dean, assistant dean, and director are also used for the role of the chief business officer&lt;ref name=UB2008&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;
==Commercial Companies==
In the [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]], and emerging innovation industries, the Chief Business Officers assume full management responsibility for the company’s deal making, provides leadership and execute a deal strategy that will allow the company to fulfill its scientific/technology mission and build shareholder value, provides managerial guidance to the company’s product development staff as needed.  Reporting directly to the Board of Directors and/or the CEO of the company, CBO sometimes has a dual role as a [[Chief Commercial Officer]] and [[Chief Strategy Officer]].

The CBO is often given the responsibilities to conduct all business and corporate development activities, maintain relationship and project management of all partnership agreements, ensure marketing activities, including website related, activities, and more importantly, develop an [[Exit_strategy#In_business|exit strategy]] for the company to be acquired or go [[IPO]].

==Academics &amp; Research Institutes==
The titles of executive vice president and senior vice president are found most often in a university’s central administration office and a hierarchical relationship does not necessarily exist between those positions and the chief business officer position of a university affiliated institute or center which is often at an equivalent level. Several large public school districts in the United States now employ chief business officers to oversee the business operations of the school district as well as the work of individual school business managers. [[Independent schools]] increasingly use the chief business officer&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Mari, and Marc Levinson, eds. Welcome to the Jungle: A Business Officer's Guide to Independent School Finance &amp; Operations. Denver: National Business Officers Association (NBOA), 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  title to identify the school [[finance director]] or [[school business manager]]. The chief business officer position in education should not be confused with the unrelated [[chief commercial officer]] or [[chief business development officer]] positions in other industries. Additionally, the chief business development officer title is often shortened to chief business officer in [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]], and [[startup companies]].

The Chief Business Officer is responsible for the administrative, financial, and operations management of the organization often combining the roles of [[chief administrative officer ]](CAO), [[chief financial officer ]](CFO), and [[chief operating officer ]](COO). As a result, the executive holding the chief business officer position, by definition, will usually possess a broader range of experience and more extensive skill set&lt;ref&gt;Sanaghan, Goldstein, and Jurow.

As one of the highest ranking executives in an academic or research organization, the chief business officer may oversee strategic planning in addition to budgeting, financial management, contracts, human resources, procurement, compliance, real estate, facilities, information technology and risk management. At many colleges and universities [[sustainability]] and [[green building]] initiatives fall under the purview of the chief business officer while other institutions include community and local government relations in the CBO's responsibilities&lt;ref name=wp2006&gt;{{Citation

.

==Qualifications==
Many Chief Business Officers hold advanced academic degrees (MBA, PhD, etc.) or leading professional credentials and continue to participate in academic research or consulting projects in their areas of expertise. Job experience for the chief business officer role is generally gained, on the job, at the department, unit or program level prior to advancing into a chief business officer role although business officers at all levels are sometimes hired from private industry, government or other non-profit organizations.

Educational requirements for the chief business officer position vary by different commercial companies and institutions&lt;ref name=wp2007&gt;{{Citation

'''Civic''' is the name by which the [[central business district]] of [[Canberra]] is commonly known. It is also called Civic Centre, City Centre, Canberra City and Canberra, but its official division name is '''''City'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planning.act.gov.au/tools_resources/place_search/place_search3?sq_content_src=%252BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkYyMDMuOS4yNDkuMyUyRlBsYWNlTmFtZXMlMkZQbGFjZXNMaXN0LmFzcHglM0YmYWxsPTE%253D&amp;catid=0&amp;partialName=City |title=Search for street and suburb names: City |work=Environment and Planning Directorate |publisher=[[Government of the Australian Capital Territory|ACT Government]] |accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Postcodes in Australia|postcode]]: 2601).

Canberra's City was established in 1927, although the division name City was not gazetted until 20 September 1928. [[Walter Burley Griffin]]'s design for Canberra included a "Civic Centre" with a separate "Market Centre" located at what is now [[Russell, Australian Capital Territory|Russell]]. However [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Stanley Bruce]] vetoed this idea and only the Civic Centre was developed; the idea of the Market Centre was abandoned.

==Overview==
Some of the earliest buildings constructed in Canberra were the Sydney and Melbourne buildings which flank [[Northbourne Avenue, Canberra|Northbourne Avenue]]. The buildings house many shops, bars and restaurants.

The [[Canberra Centre]], a three-storey shopping complex is Civic's main shopping precinct with a retail presence from the national chains [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]], [[Myer]], [[Big W]] and [[Target (Australia)|Target]] department stores. Nearby is [[Glebe Park, Canberra|Glebe Park]], a picturesque park near the centre of the city with elm trees and oaks from early European settlement before the city was founded. It has a children's play park. It is popular with people on their lunch breaks and younger children from the surrounding areas. Civic also is home to the [[Canberra Theatre]], [[Casino Canberra]], [[Canberra Museum and Gallery]] and the [[National Convention Centre Canberra|National Convention Centre]]. 

[[Garema Place, Canberra|Garema Place]] and [[City Walk, Canberra|City Walk]] are open areas of Civic for pedestrian traffic with many outdoor cafes. One of the longest running cafes in Civic is [[Gus's|Gus's Cafe]] on [[Bunda Street]].  

A local [[City Bus Station|bus station]] predominantly used by [[ACTION]], the ACT government-operated bus service, is located on East Row, Alinga Street, [[Mort Street, Canberra|Mort Street]] and Northbourne Avenue. On the western side of Northbourne Avenue (north of Alinga Street) is the Jolimont Centre, which is the bus terminal for [[Greyhound Australia]] and [[Murrays]].

Canberra City has relatively low height limits on buildings for the centre of a major city: the maximum height of buildings in Civic is 617 metres above sea level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/ni/2008-27/copy/109824/pdf/2008-27.pdf|title=City Precinct Map and Code 
|publisher=ACT Environment and Sustainable Development|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is derived from the altitude of [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]]. This height limit is equivalent to approximately 12 storeys for an office building or about 15 storeys for a residential building.

==History==
[[File:SydneyAndMelbourneBuildingsCivic1929.jpg|thumb|1929 picture of the Sydney Building looking across Northbourne Avenue from the Melbourne Building.]]
[[File:BlueMoonCafeCanberraJanuary1953.jpg|thumb|Blue Moon Cafe in 1953]]

Before the development of the City of Canberra, there was no clear commercial centre for the area, other than nearby [[Queanbeyan]]. Murray's store, considered the area's first retail store, operated from a house built in 1874 on the [[wiktionary:glebe|glebe]] of [[St John the Baptist Church, Reid|St John the Baptist Church]], within the present boundaries of [[Commonwealth Park]], to the east of what is now Nerang Pool. It burnt down in 1923.

Griffin's plan separated the national centre, the administrative centre of the city, now the [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]], from the Civic Centre, the principal commercial area. The commercial centre was planned to be on what Griffin described as the Municipal Axis which was projected to run north-west from [[Mount Pleasant, Australian Capital Territory|Mount Pleasant]]. Variations from Griffin's plan that affect City include the abandonment of a city railway and a reduction in the widths of some streets, including of London Circuit which was planned to be {{convert|200|ft|m}} and was reduced to {{convert|100|ft|m}}. Griffin's civic focus on Vernon Knoll, now known as [[City Hill, Canberra|City Hill]], has not materialised mainly because of the way city building has progressed.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=H. W |editor=White, H. L. |title=Canberra: A Nation's Capital |year=1954 |publisher=Angus and Robertson |location=Sydney |pages=209–220
|chapter=Factors of Site and Plan |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major buildings planned for the commercial centre were the Melbourne and Sydney Buildings, which were designed in the "Inter-War Mediterranean style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nca.gov.au/sites/g/files/net791/f/consultation/Northbourne%20Plaza%20Statement%20of%20Heritage%20Effects.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821070326/https://www.nca.gov.au/sites/g/files/net791/f/consultation/Northbourne%20Plaza%20Statement%20of%20Heritage%20Effects.pdf|archivedate=21 August 2017|title=Northbourne Plaza Project: Statement of Heritage Effects|author=Philip Leeson Architects Pty Ltd|date=15 August 2017|page=3|accessdate=21 August 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in 1926 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Building of Civic Centre |work=[[The Canberra Times]]
|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/1206913/20287 |date=10 September 1926 |accessdate=24 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were finally completed in 1946. Immediately after [[World War II]], the Melbourne and Sydney buildings still comprised the main part of Civic and the Blue Moon Cafe was the only place to go for a meal apart from the Hotel Canberra and the Hotel Civic.&lt;ref name="Gorman"/&gt;

Up until the 1960s, Canberra shoppers found the retail environment frustrating.  Many did their weekly shopping in Queanbeyan, where the central business district was more compact.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt; Major purchases were made in Sydney.&lt;ref name="Gorman"&gt;{{cite web |last=Green |first=Stephanie |url=http://www.gormanhouse.com.au/info/history.php |title=Gorman House history |publisher=Gorman House Arts Centre |accessdate=16 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, the Monaro Mall (now [[Canberra Centre]]) opened. It included a branch of the [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]] department store.

==Notable buildings and urban spaces==

=== Sydney and Melbourne Buildings ===
[[File:Civic-city walk.JPG|thumb|right|City Walk, a pedestrian mall in Civic is a focus of retail activity and outdoor dining.]] 

The Melbourne and Sydney buildings were based on design principles set by [[John Sulman]] in sketch form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/history-of-the-sydney-building-20140217-32vfl.html|archivedate=18 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218222821/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/history-of-the-sydney-building-20140217-32vfl.html|date=17 February 2014|publisher=Fairfax Media|newspaper=The Canberra Times|first=Ian|last=Warden|title=History of the Sydney Building}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design work was finalised by John Hunter Kirkpatrick. The buildings were the model which establish the colonnade principle, an important design element throughout Civic.&lt;ref name="heritageregisterSydMel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/12980/heritageregister20032.pdf |title=20032. Melbourne and Sydney Buildings |format=pdf |work=Entry to the ACT Heritage Register; Heritage Act 2004 |publisher=ACT Heritage Council |accessdate=16 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819233335/http://www.environment.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/12980/heritageregister20032.pdf |archivedate=19 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1921 to 1924 Sulman was chairman of the [[Federal Capital Advisory Committee]], and in that role was involved in the planning of Canberra and refining Griffin's plan.

Sulman's concept of arcaded [[loggia]]s was derived from [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s [[Ospedale degli Innocenti]] (Foundling Hospital) and the cloisters of the 15th century [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze]]. The Mediterranean influence was maintained by Kirkpatrick with Roman roof tiles and cast embellishments such as roundels. The buildings were originally constructed with open first floor verandahs which have since largely been glazed in.
[[File:Glebe_Park,_Canberra.jpg|thumb|right|[[Glebe Park, Canberra|Glebe Park]] in Spring]]
The Melbourne Building was sold sequentially as independent parcels from 1927 until 1946. The corner of West Row and London Circuit was built specifically for the Bank of New South Wales (now the [[Westpac Banking Corporation]]). The manager lived above the bank. Much of the Melbourne Building facing West Row was completed by the Commonwealth Government in 1946 and used as the location of the Commonwealth Employment Service. From 1944 to 1953, the Canberra University College was housed in the Melbourne building. On 11 April 1953 the Melbourne Building was severely damaged by fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/no-shortage-of-help-in-fighting-the-great-fire-of-1953-20140218-32ybs.html|archivedate=18 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218233017/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/no-shortage-of-help-in-fighting-the-great-fire-of-1953-20140218-32ybs.html|title=No shortage of help in fighting the great fire of 1953|newspaper=The Canberra Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=19 February 2014|first=Ian|last=Warden}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the college relocated (it eventually became the [[Australian National University]]).

On 17 February 2014, the Sydney Building was significantly damaged by a fire which began with an explosion in a ground floor Japanese restaurant adjacent to East Row around 9.45 am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/fire-at-sydney-building-in-civic-20140217-32utq.html|title=Fire at Sydney Building in Civic|author1=Rickard, Lucy|author2=Westcott, Ben|author3=Raggatt, Matthew|publisher=''[[The Canberra Times]]''|date=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire was quickly brought under control, but was not extinguished until 2 am on 18 February 2014. During the blaze, a section of the heritage listed building's roof collapsed. The fire saw the evacuation of 40 businesses as well as closures of several roads and the City Bus Station, causing bus route diversions and major disruption to ACTION public transport services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/civic-chaos-continues-as-sydney-building-fire-investigated-20140218-32yu5.html|title=Civic chaos continues as Sydney Building fire investigated|author=McIlroy, Tom|publisher=''[[The Canberra Times]]''|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was the second fire in the building - in 2002 a fire extensively damaged Mooseheads bar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/best-to-steer-clear-of-out-of-control-adfa-boys/story-e6frea6u-1226037488246|title=Best to steer clear of 'out-of-control' ADFA boys|author=Jean, David|publisher=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|location=[[Adelaide]]|date=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; also resulting in a partial roof collapse.

===Hotel Civic===
[[File:CanberraHotelCivic1951 2.jpg|thumb|Hotel Civic Canberra]]

The Hotel Civic opened in 1935. It was constructed in an Art Deco style from Canberra Cream bricks. It was demolished in late 1984 through early 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basis.act.gov.au/DUSLibrary/ImagesACT.nsf/3506a89b45287c52ca256abc000c49a8/3619baae734d515c4a256bcd001d76b4!OpenDocument |title=60 tonne capacity excavator demolishes the Hotel Civic; photograph taken 30 January 1985 | work=Image Library |publisher=ACT Heritage Library |accessdate=16 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel was on the corner of Alinga Street and the eastern side of Northbourne Avenue.

In 1965, the Hotel Civic was the scene of a protest about the segregation of women in the hotel:&lt;blockquote&gt;... a protest where a number of us [including the interviewee Helen Jarvis] chained ourselves to the bar in the Hotel Civic. Women weren't allowed to be served in the public bar -- that was the law in both NSW and the ACT. We had to use the saloon bar or the ladies' bar, where prices were higher, or to huddle out the back around the old kegs. They were also morose places, at least at the Civic, which was the only pub near the university. The public bar had all the spirit.  We chained ourselves to the public bar. The bartender wouldn't serve us, but there were some sympathetic men who bought drinks for us. The newspapers trivialised it, of course: they wrote it up with the headline, “Women breast the bar”.&lt;ref name="???"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cheng |first=Eva |year= |url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/1995/184/184p11.htm |title=Vietnam and the women's liberation movement |work=[[Green Left Weekly]] |accessdate=16 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Civic Square===
[[File:CivicSquareACT.JPG|thumb|Civic Square]]

Civic Square houses the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]], [[Canberra Museum and Gallery]], Civic Library and [[Canberra Theatre]] as well as many local cultural organisations, including the Canberra division of the [[National Trust of Australia]].

Civic Square was designed by [[Yuncken Freeman]] architects and completed in 1961. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Civic Square is sited within a primary axis of Griffin's design for Canberra which links City Hill and [[Mount Ainslie]]. Griffin intended that the square be the ‘heart of the city’. Civic Square was listed on the register of the former [[National Estate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;search=place_name%3DCivic%2520Square%3Btown%3DCanberra%3Bstate%3DACT%3Blist_code%3DRNE%3Bkeyword_PD%3Don%3Bkeyword_SS%3Don%3Bkeyword_PH%3Don%3Blatitude_1dir%3DS%3Blongitude_1dir%3DE%3Blongitude_2dir%3DE%3Blatitude_2dir%3DS%3Bin_region%3Dpart;place_id=19428| title=Civic Square Complex, London Cct, Canberra, ACT, Australia|publisher=Department of the Environment|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canberra Theatre]] was opened in June 1965 with the [[Australian Ballet Company|Australian Ballet]]’s production of ''[[Swan Lake]]''. The old Playhouse, also from 1965, was demolished and rebuilt in 1998. The link between the Theatre and Playhouse buildings has been redeveloped to include the Civic Library and the theatre's bar and administration area.

A sculpture of ''Ethos'' by [[Tom Bass (sculptor)|Tom Bass]] was commissioned by the [[National Capital Development Commission]] in 1959 and unveiled in 1961. "The NCDC intended that the work would emphasize that Canberra is the non-political centre, the locale of commerce and of private enterprise in its best sense." The sculpture was designed to represent the spirit of the community. Bass interpreted this in the figure which he intended "the love which Canberra people have for their city to be identified with her...I want them to be conscious of her first as an image from a distance...then comes the moment when they become personally involved with her... they feel her looking at them, reflecting their love for the place".
[[File:Canberra's City Centre at night.jpg|thumb|left|Canberra City at night]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;The form of the work is highly symbolic. The figure is robed in a fabric richly embossed with emblems and figures representing the Community. The shallow saucer on which the figure stands represents Canberra's nick-name "Frosty Hollow". The saucer is 6 sided because the plan for Civic square is itself hexagonal. The surface of the saucer bears a relief map of Canberra and the rolling countryside around it. At the feet of Ethos are indentations that represent the lake that was later to fill the space between the Civic Centre and the administrative part of the city. The bursting sun she holds aloft is symbolic of culture and enlightenment which the presence of Canberra's University, its research organisations and the Diplomatic Corps and so on give to the city.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Bass regarded the work as his most important civic work.  During the 1960s and 70s, pictures of the sculpture were frequently used in Canberra tourism images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/13669/heritageregister10007.pdf |title=10007.

===Canberra Centre===
{{main|Canberra Centre}}
[[File:Civic, Canberra.jpg|thumb|right|Height restrictions have limited the amount of tall buildings constructed in Civic.]]
Civic's major shopping mall is the [[Canberra Centre]]. Opened as the Monaro Mall in 1963, it was the first Australian three-storey, fully enclosed and air conditioned shopping centre. It was opened by the Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=702|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130013108/http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=702|archivedate=30 January 2014|date=5 March 1963|title=Opening of the Monaro Shopping Mall|location=Canberra|first=Robert|last=Menzies|author-link=Robert Menzies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 it was substantially redeveloped and renamed the Canberra Centre. A further redevelopment was completed by late 2007, substantially adding to the diversity of retailers and services within it including a Dendy Cinema complex.

The '''Davie-Brown Index''' (DBI) is an independent index for [[brand]] marketers and agencies that quantifies consumer perceptions of more than 2,900 celebrities, including TV and film stars, musical artists, reality TV stars, news personalities, politicians, athletes, and business leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/16143/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed in 2006 by Sharp Analytics and white labeled by celebrity talent division of [[The Marketing Arm]], an [[Omnicom Group]] Inc. promotion agency, the DBI provides marketers with a systematic approach for quantifying the use of celebrities in their advertising and marketing initiatives. DBI data is designed to help determine a celebrity's ability to influence brand affinity and consumer purchase intent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB113979992994972159]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to various news articles, the DBI consists of a 1.5 million-member consumer research panel which evaluates a celebrity’s awareness, appeal and relevance to a brand’s image and their influence on [[consumer]] buying behavior. Respondents who are aware of a certain celebrity are asked a standard set of questions about that celebrity.  Using a six-point scale, consumers evaluate celebrities across seven key attributes:  Appeal, Breakthrough, Trendsetter, Influence, Trust, Endorsement, and Aspiration. An overall DBI score is developed each time a [[celebrity]] is indexed and can be narrowed down to key [[demographics]], including [[gender]], age and ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/news/new-index-rates-oprahs-and-other-celebs-marketing-muscle-3256/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Updated weekly, DBI attribute rankings are dynamic and change depending on major events (e.g., industry awards, positive/negative news, etc.).

In 2013, The Marketing Arm partnered with Repucom, a market research firm, to launch the Index in 12 international markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research-live.com/news/analytics/celebrity-index-goes-international/4009836.article]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Don Edward Schultz''' (born January 20, 1934) is Professor Emeritus of Service at [[Northwestern University]]'s [[Medill]] School.  He's most notable for his research and writing on [[Integrated Marketing Communications]] (IMC).

==Education and early career==

Schultz earned a [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] from [[University of Oklahoma]] in 1957, a [[Master of Arts]] in [[Advertising]] from [[Michigan State University]] in 1975, and a Ph.D. in [[Mass Media]] from Michigan State in 1977. Schultz began his career in publication sales and management. In 1965,  he joined the firm of Tracy-Locke Advertising and Public Relations based in Dallas, Texas where he gained skills in [[advertising]] and [[marketing communications]]. 

==Academic career==
In the mid-1970s, Schultz began teaching advertising at the Michigan State University and in 1977, he joined the Faculty at Northwestern University where he became Department Chair and Associate Dean. &lt;ref&gt;Medill University, "Don E. Schultz," ''Biographical Notes,'' &lt;Online: http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/directory/faculty/don-e-schultz.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1991, Schultz was part of a team at the [[Medill School of Journalism]], [[Northwestern University]] which in conjunction with the [[American Association of Advertising Agencies]] (AAAA), began the first empirical study designed to investigate how [[integrated marketing communications]] was being used by practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, D. and Kitchen, P., "Integrated Marketing Communications in US Advertising Agencies: An Exploratory Study," ''Journal of Adaertising Research,'' Vol. 37, no, 5, 1997, pp.7-17&lt;/ref&gt; The study focused around understanding the concept and the importance of IMC and also to analyse the extent in which IMC was practiced in all major U.S advertising agencies. When this initial study was replicated by other studies in a number of countries; New Zealand, UK, US, Australia, India, Thailand, South Africa and the Philippines, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, pp. 8-9; Ichul, L., Han, D. and Schultz, D., "Understanding the Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' Vol. 44, No. 1, 2004, pp 31-45&lt;/ref&gt;, they demonstrated that the new IMC was far from a "short-lived managerial fad" but rather was "a very clear reaction by advertising agencies and their clients as they are affected by a multitude of factors such as new forms of information technology including development and usage of databases, media fragmentation, client desires for interaction/synergy, and global and regional coordination."&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, P.J. and Schultz, D.E. "A Multi-Country Comparison of the Drive for IMC." ''Journal of Advertising Research,''Vol. 39, No. 1, 1999, p. 21; Shimp, T.A. ''Advertising Promotion and Other Aspects of Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Cengage, 2008, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively these studies suggested that marketing communications was undergoing a transitional phase.

In 1993, Schultz and his team published the first text-book dedicated to IMC.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, D. E., Tannenbaum, S.I. and Lauterborn, R.F., ''Integrated Marketing Communications: Putting it together and making it work, '' Lincolnwood, Ill., NTC Business Books, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Their work, simply entitled, ''Integrated Marketing Communications,'' described IMC as a totally new way of looking at the whole of marketing communications, rather than looking at each of the parts separately. Also in 1993, Schultz and the Medill School at Northwestern University changed their curriculum to include a focus on this new idea of integrated marketing communications rather than the traditional program which had emphasised advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; 

Often referred to as the "father of integrated marketing",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2010/04/schultz.html Northwestern University, Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award, April 12, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz is the author or co-author of 28 books and 150 trade/academic articles on [[marketing]]. &lt;ref&gt;Medill University, "Don E. Schultz," ''Biographical Notes,'' &lt;Online: http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/directory/faculty/don-e-schultz.html&lt;/ref&gt; His books include: ''Integrated Marketing Communications'' (1993); ''Communicating Globally'' (2000) and ''IMC: The Next Generation'' (2003).  He writes a regular column on Integrated Marketing for ''Marketing Management'' magazine, the trade publication of the [[American Marketing Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_tc_2_0?rh=i%3Astripbooks%2Ck%3ADon+E.+Schultz&amp;keywords=Don+E.+Schultz&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1301265925&amp;sr=1-2-ent&amp;field-contributor_id=B001H9XTPG Amazon author list]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Mazur''' (born 1946) is a [[Polish-American]] businessman.

== Personal and Professional History ==

Mazur was born in Poland, [[immigrated]] to the U.S. as a child in the 1960s, and became [[naturalized]] in 1969. He obtained a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Chicago Technical College and held various executive positions at Cargill International and John Deere &amp; Co. After working with those companies on developing their markets in [[Central Europe]], he became involved in a number of his own business ventures in Poland after the end of the [[Communist]] rule in 1989. He was a co-founder of Bakoma S.A., the largest yogurt company in Poland, which was eventually acquired by Dannon Company. In 2003, Mazur was listed as one of the 25 richest Poles, with his family's permanent residence in Glenview, IL.

== Investigation and Dropped Charges ==

He was accused by Poland's prosecutors of contracting, in 1998, the murder of Polish National Police chief, General [[Marek Papała]]. In August 2014, the Polish prosecution dropped their case against Mazur. After a lengthy prosecution, they cited a lack of evidence against him to conclude that he committed the crime.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/material-dowodowy-jest-niewystarczajacy-by-uznac-ze-mazur-dopuscil-sie-zarzucanego-mu-przestepstwa,460595.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazur was arrested in the U.S. in 2006 on a Polish [[extradition]] request. While that request dated back to 2005, the U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] had not taken any action on it until Poland's Minister of Justice [[Zbigniew Ziobro]] personally intervened with [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]]. The Polish  government alleged that Mazur had paid Polish organized crime figures $40,000 to murder General Papała. On 20 July 2007, after Mazur spent nine months in federal detention, Poland's request was rejected by Federal Magistrate Arlander Keys (Northern Illinois District Court) for lack of [[probable cause]], mainly because the 
principal witness, Artur Zirajewski, lacked credibility in the court's view. Judge Keys harshly criticized the extradition request calling the government's reliance on Zirajewski's identification as "shocking and offensive" and stated that in his 12 years on the bench he hadn't even been close to rejecting an extradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/judge/keys/pdfs/Mazur_07202007.pdf U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. In the matter of Extradition of Edward Mazur] Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys, July 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazur's lawyer argued that his case exposed weaknesses in the U.S. [[extradition]] law  dealing with the countries "lacking many of the legal safeguards of the United States". He accused Polish authorities of framing his client out of vindictiveness and a desire to smear the leftist opposition, to which Mazur has close ties, and the U.S. government of pursuing this "paper-thin" case out of political expedience to placate an allied government.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jenner.com/files/tbl_s20Publications%5CRelatedDocumentsPDFs1252%5C1813%5CLegalTimes_Gair_9_10_07.pdf Whose Side is Uncle Sam on?] Chris C. Gair, Legal Times, Vol. XXX, No. 37, Sept 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, the charges were dropped by Poland. The Polish authorities cited they lacked sufficient evidence that would suggest that he committed the crime.&lt;ref&gt;http://wpolityce.pl/spoleczenstwo/210086-prokuratura-umorzyla-postepowanie-wobec-edwarda-mazura&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Ellen Pao was born in 1970 in New Jersey. She is the middle child of three daughters born to Tsyh-Wen Pao and Young-Ping Pao, immigrants from Taiwan.&lt;ref name=Fortune /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanity/&gt; Her father, Young-Ping Pao, was a professor at [[New York University]]'s [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]]. Her mother, Tsyh-Wen Pao (née Lee) worked as an engineer in computer sciences at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0096055178900061|first1=Tsyh-Wen Lee|last1=Pao|first2=John|last2=Carr|title=A solution of the syntactical induction-inference problem for regular languages|journal=Computer Languages|volume=3|year=1978|accessdate=2015-08-04|doi=10.1016/0096-0551(78)90006-1|pages=53–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen Pao is fluent in [[English language|English]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and first learned to code from her mother at age ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ekp/status/628786206944313344|title=Story about female engineers|first=Ellen|last=Pao|publisher=Twitter|date=2015-08-04|accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pao family raised their children in [[Maplewood, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="pao"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Reddit&gt;{{cite news| url=http://fortune.com/2013/04/11/ellen-pao-has-landed-at-reddit/ | work=Fortune | title=Ellen Pao has landed ... at Reddit | first=Dan | last=Primack | date=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young-Ping Pao died in 1987 when Ellen was in the 12th grade of high school.&lt;ref name=Vanity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/scandal/2013/03/buddy-fletcher-ellen-pao|title=Sex, lies and lawsuits|first=Suzanna|last=Andrews|work=Vanity Fair|date=2013-03-01|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/03/17/ellen-pao-kleiner-perkins-china-singtao-daily-journal-ktsf/24905541/|title=Ellen Pao trial is big news in China|author= Weise, Elizabeth |date=March 17, 2015|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pao’s maternal grandparents are Yu-Wen Lee and Ching-Hsin (née Liu) Lee, who were from [[Baoding]] in the [[Hebei]] province near [[Beijing]]. Pao’s maternal grandfather&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/obituaries-feb-11-2011-1005708.php#page-6|title=Obituaries: Feb 11, 2011|publisher=Greenwich Time|date=2011-02-09|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a graduate of the [[Republic of China Military Academy]], He later went on to serve as a commander in the [[Chinese Civil War]] under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and, in 1948, moved the family to [[Taiwan]], where he retired with the rank of Colonel in 1960. In October 1972, his wife and daughter Elizabeth moved to the New York City area to join Pao’s mother&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/greenwichtime/obituary.aspx?n=ching-hsin-liu-lee&amp;pid=87357230|title=Ching-Hsin Liu Lee obituary|publisher=Greenwich Time|date=2007-04-20|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aunt and uncle who were already studying in the US. Yu-Wen Lee was the fourth child of his father, merchant Lien-Ren Lee, Pao's great grandfather.

Pao graduated from [[Princeton University]], the ''alma mater'' of her two sisters, with a bachelor's degree in [[Electrical Engineering]] in 1991. Immediately after, she attended [[Harvard Law School]], where she earned a [[Juris Doctor]] in 1994.&lt;ref name=pao/&gt; After two years of working, Pao returned to attend [[Harvard Business School]], where she received an MBA in 1998.&lt;ref name=Fortune /&gt;

==Career==
From 1994 to 1996, Pao worked as a [[corporate attorney]] at [[Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore]]. In 1998, Pao worked at [[MSN TV|WebTV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/09/liveblog-as-ellen-pao-takes-the-stand-the-test-now-is-likability/|title=Ellen Pao Takes the Stand in Her Suit Against Kleiner Perkins |work=Re/code |date=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pao worked at several companies in [[Silicon Valley]] including [[BEA Systems]] as Senior Director of Corporate Business Development from 2001 until 2005.&lt;ref name=Fortune /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/person/ellen-pao|title=Ellen Pao|work=crunchbase.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Pao joined Kleiner Perkins, an established [[venture capital]] firm in San Francisco, as technical chief of staff for [[John Doerr]], a senior partner, a job that required degrees in engineering, law, and business and experience in enterprise software.&lt;ref name=Fortune /&gt; In 2007 she was appointed a [[Aspen Institute#Aspen Global Leadership Network|Crown Fellow]] of the [[Aspen Institute]] on the recommendation of Doerr, a trustee.&lt;ref name=Fortune /&gt;&lt;ref name=Aspen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspeninstitute.org/news/2007/06/14/aspen-institute-names-emerging-leaders-2007-henry-crown-fellows|title=Aspen Institute Names Emerging Leaders As 2007 Henry Crown Fellows|accessdate=2007-06-14|publisher=The Aspen Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2007, she became a junior investing partner with Ted Schlein as her boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/23/a-whos-who-of-the-kleiner-perkins-ellen-pao-trial/|title=A Who’s Who of the Ellen Pao-Kleiner Perkins Trial |work=Re/code|date=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Pao2 &gt;2nd and 3rd entries (at bottom)[http://recode.net/2015/03/10/liveblog-day-two-of-ellen-pao-on-the-stand/ "Liveblog: Day Two of Ellen Pao on the Stand"] Re/code.

On May 10, 2012, Pao filed a [[gender discrimination]] lawsuit against her employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/22/kleiner-discrimination-idUSL1E8GMAJS20120522 | title=Kleiner gender discrimination suit | accessdate=May 24, 2012 | work=Reuters | date=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit alleged [[Organizational retaliatory behavior#Workplace retaliation|workplace retaliation]] by Ajit Nazre, a male junior partner, resulting from his and Pao's romantic affair.&lt;ref name=NYT03515&gt;{{cite news | author1=[[David Streitfeld]] | title=In Ellen Pao’s Suit vs. Kleiner Perkins, World of Venture Capital Is Under Microscope | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/technology/in-ellen-paos-suit-vs-kleiner-perkins-world-of-venture-capital-is-under-microscope.html | accessdate=March 6, 2015 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to work at the firm until October 1.

Opposition increased on July 2 when large sections of Reddit were set to private to protest the dismissal of Victoria Taylor, Reddit's director of talent, known for co-ordinating the [[Reddit#IAmA and AMA|Ask Me Anything]] interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/03/reddit-ama-administrator_n_7723618.html|title=Reddit community revolts after 'Ask Me Anything' administrator is dismissed|first=Andy|last=Campbell|work=The Huffington Post|date=2015-07-03|accessdate=2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressing frustration over the decline in communication from Reddit management, AMA moderators stated that they had only learned about the firing indirectly after it happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2015/07/ill-miss-working-with-reddits-victoria-taylor/|title=I'll Miss Working With reddit's Victoria Taylor|first=Ryan|last=Holiday|work=The Observer|date=2015-07-06|accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/opinion/why-we-shut-down-reddits-ask-me-anything-forum.html|title=Why we shut down Reddit's 'Ask Me Anything' forum|first1=Brian|last1=Lynch|first2=Courtnie|last2=Swearingen|work=The New York Times|date=2015-07-08|accessdate=2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite one post to the contrary, Taylor's dismissal was widely attributed to Pao, with some commentators suggesting that the move diminished her credibility as an advocate for female employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/07/08/ellen-pao-and-victoria-taylor-find-themselves-on-opposite-ends-of-the-great-reddit-revolt/|title=Ellen Pao and Victoria Taylor find themselves on opposite ends of the great reddit revolt|first=Brigit|last=Katz|work=The New York Times|date=2015-07-08|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received increased harassment as a result and the petition for her removal surpassed 200,000 signatures.&lt;ref name="200k" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="isaac" /&gt; On July 3, Pao issued apologies through Reddit and [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3945718/reddit-moderator-shut-down/|title=Reddit's Ellen Pao and Alexis Ohanian explain site shut down|first=Matt|last=Vella|work=Time|date=2015-07-03|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Reddit post was thought to have been deleted after it received enough downvotes to lose visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/reddit-in-chaos-after-allegedly-firing-ama-coordinator-1715556970 |title=Reddit in chaos after allegedly firing AMA coordinator |first=Ashley |last=Feinberg |work=Gawker |date=2015-07-02 |accessdate=2015-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808183215/http://gawker.com/reddit-in-chaos-after-allegedly-firing-ama-coordinator-1715556970 |archivedate=August 8, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a longer post on July 6, she apologized for poor communication between staff members and for not delivering on promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/technology/reddits-chief-apologizes-after-employees-dismissal.html|title=Reddit's chief apologizes after employee's dismissal|first=Mike|last=Isaac|work=The New York Times|date=2015-07-06|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pao resigned on July 10 and was replaced by Reddit co-founder [[Steve Huffman]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Nils Wilhelm Erik Penser''' (born August 22, 1942) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[financier]] and [[businessman]].

Penser was born in [[Eslöv]], Sweden, the son Wilhelm Penser, a lawyer, and Elisabeth (née Herrmann).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Uddling |editor1-first=Hans |editor2-last=Paabo |editor2-first=Katrin |date=1994 |title=Vem är det: svensk biografisk handbok. 1995 |trans-title=Who is it: Swedish biographical handbook. 1995 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Norstedt |isbn=91-1-943202-X |language=Swedish |id={{LIBRIS|8261514}} |url=http://runeberg.org/vemardet/1995/0882.html |page=882}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having studied law at [[Lund University]], Erik Penser commenced a career as a [[stockbroker]] at ''Bankirfirman Langenskiöld'', which later became [[Carnegie Investment Bank]]. Together with Thomas Fischer he worked intensively to develop the firm’s business, laying the foundation for his private wealth. Penser's strategy was risky; he bought shares, used them as collateral and borrowed even more money to leverage his holdings. Eventually he gained the controlling interest of several large companies on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]].

During the 1980s Penser was one of Sweden's most influential businessmen. Through his holding company, [[Yggdrasil]], he controlled both [[Nobel Industrier]] and [[Finans AB Gamlestaden]]. His massive [[leverage (finance)|financial leverage]] and the harsh business environment experienced during the [[Swedish banking rescue|Swedish banking crisis in 1990-1994]] forced Penser to cease control of his holdings, which were sold to Nordbanken (which became [[Nordea]]) for the symbolic sum of SEK 1 each. At a press conference [[Björn Wahlström]], the chairman of Nordbanken, said that Erik Penser was 'destitute and finished as a businessman'. The transaction resulted in a prolonged legal dispute between Penser and Nordbanken.

In 1992 Penser regained control of Yggdrasil, the consideration was once again SEK 1. The vice Chairman of Nordbanken, [[Jacob Palmstierna]], admitted that Penser had been under extreme pressure when he was forced to sign the agreement with Nordbanken. Since then Penser has rebuilt an estimated net worth of SEK 1 billion, with interests in both Sweden and abroad. In Sweden, his main holdings includes [[Erik Penser Bankaktiebolag]], with activities in corporate finance, trading, research and private wealth management and [[Pensum]], an insurance and pension advisory firm. Erik Penser resides, since 1976, in [[Compton Beauchamp]], England.

Erik Penser is known as a distinguished [[collecting|collector]], collecting - amongst many objects - old share certificates, film posters, magazines and bank notes.

'''Frederick Estcourt Bucknall''' (6 July 1835 – 4 June 1896) was an English-born publican, brewer and politician in the early days of the colony of [[South Australia]].

==Life==
[[File:Estcourt House, Tennyson.jpg|thumb|Estcourt House, [[Tennyson, South Australia|Tennyson]], built by Bucknall in 1881-3.]]
Bucknall was a member of the Estcourts of [[Shipton Moyne|Estcourt]], an influential old family, in the counties of [[Gloucester]] and [[Wiltshire]], but born in London, where his father, William Bucknall of [[Crutched Friars]], was Commodore of the [[Royal Thames Yacht Club]].&lt;ref name=SAR&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article53688178 |title=The Late Mr. F. E. Bucknall |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=5 June 1896 |accessdate=10 February 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after he arrived in South Australia around 1860&lt;ref name=SAR/&gt; via [[Melbourne]], the original [[River Torrens#Torrens_Lake|Torrens Dam]] was nearly completed, and he built a fleet of fine pleasure craft which he placed on the lake for hire, but the dam failed and was washed away, putting paid to his enterprise. He built a boatshed on the [[Port River]] to the south-east of where the Jervois Street bridge was later built, and created a great deal of interest in [[sculling]] on the Port River. He gained approval as a Licensed Victualler and built the South Australian Club Hotel in St Vincent Street, [[Port Adelaide]] near the site of his boatshed.&lt;ref name=SAR/&gt; He married the widow of Mr. Henry Haussen, a proprietor of the [[Hindmarsh Brewery]].&lt;ref name=late&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article34549091 |title=The Late Mr. F. E. Bucknall |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=5 June 1896 |accessdate=10 February 2013 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878 Bucknall and [[Arthur Harvey (Australian politician)|Arthur Harvey]] (later to be his parliamentary colleague) formed the Grange Land and Investment Company, to develop the suburb of [[Grange, South Australia|The Grange]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charlessturt.sa.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/Local_history_factsheet_-_Grange.pdf Charles Sturt Council: ''A brief history of the suburb Grange''&lt;/ref&gt;

The business prospered and he became a wealthy man, in 1883 building a magnificent mansion "Estcourt House" on the seafront between The Grange and [[Glanville, South Australia|Glanville]]. He and Mrs. Bucknall went on a visit to England. While they were away the land boom turned to bust, and with the failure of the [[Commercial Bank of South Australia]] in 1886, he lost much of his fortune&lt;ref name=late/&gt; and was forced to relinquish his mansion to the [[AMP Society]] and find employment in the office of E. Benda and Co. of [[Grenfell Street, Adelaide|Grenfell Street]].&lt;ref name=late/&gt;

Bucknall died at his residence in Childers Street, [[North Adelaide]].

===Politics===
Bucknall entered Parliament as a member for [[Electoral district of West Torrens|West Torrens]] on 8 April 1881&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SA-parl |pid=3659 |name=Frederick Estcourt Bucknall}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a colleague of [[W. H. Bean]], and was elected for another three years in 1884 with Arthur Harvey ( – 25 January 1902) with a break 1885–1886 while he visited England for his health.&lt;ref name=SAR/&gt;

Bucknall was a supporter of projects to build the [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbor]] and the [[Central Australia Railway|North–South Railway]], but for some he was remembered as having instituted mandatory [[horse trough]]s outside licensed premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58840791 |title=Early Breweries. |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=27 November 1926 |accessdate=12 February 2013 |page=17 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civic life===
Bucknall was Mayor of [[City of Charles Sturt|Hindmarsh]] in 1881, 1882 and 1883, a position he filled with distinction.

==Other interests==
In his youth he was a boxer, athlete and president of the Hindmarsh Cricket Club, of which he was patron for over ten years prior to his death.&lt;ref name=late/&gt;

He was an enthusiastic rower, swimmer and yachtsman. He went in for boatbuilding, and owned the yachts ''Brilliant'', ''Rosa'' and ''Enchantress'', which he bought from Sir [[Thomas Elder]] (and eventually sold to Mr. Cunningham).

He was for some time secretary of the Licensed Victuallers' Association, and president for six years. He was made a life member in recognition of this service.

He was an excellent musician, and was at one time organist of the South Australian Grand Lodge of Freemasons, of which he was a member.&lt;ref name=SAR/&gt;

'''George Aubrey Burton, Jr.''' (June 21, 1926 &amp;ndash; June 10, 2014), was a [[Certified Public Accountant]] and the last elected municipal finance commissioner in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]], a position he filled from 1971 to 1978. He was the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] to have been elected to citywide office in Shreveport.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=george-a-burton&amp;pid=171346250|title=George A. Burton, Jr. obituary|publisher=''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]''|accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years, education, military==

Burton was born in [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]], [[Arkansas]], to George A. Burton, Sr. (1903–1980) and the former Theo Simmons (1908–1983). The Burtons thereafter resided in [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]] in [[Central Louisiana]] and relocated to  Shreveport in 1935.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Burton's grandfather was a railroad employee, and his father was secretary-treasurer of Cahn Electric Company in Shreveport.

Burton attended Line Avenue Elementary School in Shreveport and graduated in 1941 at the age of fifteen from [[C.E. Byrd High School]] in Shreveport. He enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] and entered the [[Seabees]] at the age of sixteen. From 1943 to 1946, he served in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]] of [[World War II]]. He was a life member of [[Disabled American Veterans]]. He obtained a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in accounting from [[Centenary College of Louisiana|Centenary College]], where he later taught accounting. He passed the C.P.A. examination in 1952.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

After graduation from Centenary College, he was employed by the Operkuch, McGuirt, Watts and West accounting firm, of which he became a partner in 1953. However, he left the company in 1954 to begin his own firm. He was active in the American Institute Of CPA's, the Louisiana Society of CPA's, and the Association of Governmental Accountants.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Political life==

A lifelong Republican, he ran unsuccessfully on November 8, 1966, for a seat on the [[Caddo Parish School Board]], as did his fellow Republican [[George Despot]], later the state party chairman.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shreveport Times'', November 9, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Her subsequently served on the Bond Issue and Rapid Learner study committees of the Caddo school board/&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In September 1971, Shreveport Finance Commissioner Dwight E. Saur, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], died after serving less than a year of his second elected term. Burton won the [[special election]] to fill the remaining three years of the term at took office on December 14, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;"Sworn in as finance commissioner", ''The Shreveport Times'', December 14, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his overt Republicanism, Burton carved his niche with his Democratic colleagues. In 1974, Burton was reelected finance commissioner with 17,488 votes (68.8 percent) over Democrat (later Republican) David R. Carroll (1926-2011), a [[Mississippi]] native and a Caddo Parish police juror,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=david-r-carroll&amp;pid=152770391|title=David R. Carroll obituary|publisher=''[[The Times (Shreveport)|Shreveport Times]]'', July 27, 2011|accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; received 7,938 ballots (31.2 percent). That year, Burton had the tacit support of Democratic [[Mayor of Shreveport, Louisiana|Mayor]] [[Calhoun Allen]], who won a second term. Under the [[City commission|commission]] form of government then in effect, changed in November 1978 to the [[mayor-council]] format, the mayor was technically the "commissioner of administration."

Running with Burton in 1974 was another Republican, [[Billy Guin]], who waged his second campaign against Public Utilities Commissioner William "Bill" Collins and polled 43 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shreveport Journal]]'', November 6, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Collins resigned in 1977, and Guin won the seat in a special election. Guin was in effect only the second Republican in modern times to hold municipal office in Shreveport. Serving with Burton were Public Safety Commissioner [[George W. D'Artois]] and Public Works Commissioner [[Don Hathaway]], both Democrats.

D'Artois was forced from office in a multi-faceted political scandal that surfaced in the spring of 1976. At one point before [[Attorney General of Louisiana|Attorney General]] [[William J. Guste]] was called to investigate, the five commissioners, including D'Artois, were conducting their own probe; "the city investigating itself," said the critics. Burton spoke out against the situation, which he found particularly alarming: "What's going on now is devastating to the city's image. I will favor anything that brings some final disposition to this matter. The city cannot move on anything until this is cleared up. We couldn't pull a public election right now endorsing motherhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NvpN1t9TMrgC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=George+Wendell+D'Artois&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FLoGsv9uIL&amp;sig=M4vFHkw4ijLolZvKDlHRFDjmACg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w0-XU5b6FuqH8AHr-YCoCQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=George%20Wendell%20D'Artois&amp;f=false|title=The Commissioner: A True Story of Deceit, Dishonor, and Death|author=[[Bill Keith (Louisiana politician)|Bill Keith]]|publisher=[[Pelican Publishing Company]]|location=[[Gretna, Louisiana|Gretna]], [[Louisiana]]|year=2009|pages=101|isbn=9781-58980-655-9|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1960 to 1980, Burton was chairman of the Caddo Parish Republican Executive Committee. From 1972 to 1980, he was secretary of the [[Louisiana Republican Party|Louisiana Republican State Central Committee]], a 144-member body which meets periodically in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. He was president of the Caddo Parish Board of Election Supervisors from 1978 to 2008.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Family and civic commitments==

Burton married the former Joan (pronounced JO ANN) Cunningham (1928–2002), who lived in  [[Amory, Mississippi|Amory]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], before her parents, William and Lucille Cunningham, relocated to Shreveport. The couple had two children, son George A. Burton, III (1948–2010), a poet in Shreveport, and his wife Melissa Fowle Burton, and daughter Sandra Burton "Sandy" Batten&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=george-a-burton&amp;pid=140510758|title=Obituary of George A. Burton, III|publisher=''[[The Times (Shreveport)|Shreveport Times]]'', March 9, 2010|accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 1950), the wife of Rick Alan Batten (born 1954) of [[Maumelle, Arkansas|Maumelle]] near [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], Arkansas. After Joan's death, Burton married Gloria Nell Brantley (1930-2013), a native of [[Homer, Louisiana|Homer]], Louisiana, and the widow of Bernard Garvin (1927–1997) of Shreveport. They were no longer married at the time of her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?pid=165926990|title=Gloria Garvin Obituary|date=July 20, 2013|publisher=''The Shreveport Times|accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton was a charter member of the Shreveport chapter of [[Sertoma International]] and was highly active in his younger years in the [[Junior Chamber International|Jaycees]] as the Shreveport president, state vice-president, and a national director. He was a founding board member of East Ridge Country Club. He was a director and treasurer of the Shreveport Legal Aid Society. Burton was a member of the [[United Methodist Church]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;"Louisiana: Burton, George A.", ''Who's Who in American Politics, 2007-2008'' (Marquis Who's Who: [[New Providence, New Jersey|New Providence]], [[New Jersey]], 2007), p. 653&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Little Rock eleven days before his 88th birthday. A memorial service was held on June 20, 2014 at Noel Memorial United Methodist Chuirch in Shreveport.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

'''Heah Joo Seang''' ({{zh|s=连裕祥|zh|t=連裕祥|p=Lián Yù Xiáng}}) was an Malayan politician, business leader, rubber magnate, philanthropist and especially a supporter of education. Malaysia, as it has since become, only existed after Joo Seang's death. His contributions span three distinct periods in the country's history: the [[British Malaya]] period, the [[Malayan Union]] period, and the [[Federation of Malaya]] period.

==Personal life==
The son of Heah Ah-Kia (or Heah Ah Kiah),&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 24 March 1950, Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yoshihara 1988, 204&lt;/ref&gt; Joo Seang was born in Sungei Nibong Kechil, a small village in Province Wellesley, Penang on 2 November 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Ong, "Fortitude: The life and times of Heah Joo Seang" 2014 page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heah Joo Seang began his education at a Chinese school in his hometown. Later on, he was sent to live in Georgetown, Penang. His uncle, Heah Lye Hiang, registered him to study in St. Xavier's Institution, a Christian missionary school, founded in 1852. He sat for, and passed the Cambridge School Certificate when he was only fourteen years old. Later on in life, when Joo Seang became successful in business, and gain prominence in politics, SXI (as the school is popularly known to the local people) benefited from his generosity. His legacy and association with the school was forever engraved in its history, when the school auditorium (fully funded by him) was named after him. For him to have contributed so willingly, he must have felt a deep sense of gratitude towards his alma mater.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Ong, "Fortitude: the life and times of Heah Joo Seang" 2014 page 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

His working life began as a clerk in his uncle Heah Lye Hiang's tapioca mill, earning [[Straits dollar|$40]] a month.&lt;ref name="Lee &amp; Chow 2007, 50-51"&gt;Lee &amp; Chow 2007, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ST25Feb1951p15&gt;The Straits Times, 25 February 1951, Page 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ST23Dec1952p14"&gt;The Straits Times, 23 December 1952, Page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Over the span of 15&amp;nbsp;years he had led three political parties – the Independence of Malaya Party, Party Negara and the Penang MCA as well as serving as national treasurer for the parent body. His last public appearance was during the official visit of MCA national President, [[Tan Siew Sin|Tan Siew-Sin]], in March. Although he had lost his voice – he had already been ill when he travelled through Borneo on party business in February – he insisted on addressing the Alliance rally in Siew-Sin's honour. Soon after he flew to England for a throat operation. He died in Brompton Hospital on 14 May.&lt;ref name="ST27May1962p10"&gt;The Straits Times, 27 May 1962, Page 10&lt;/ref&gt; He died in London on 14 May 1962, leaving behind a wife, Lim Soh-Liang (or Lim Su-Lian),&lt;ref name="Lee &amp; Chow 2007, 50-51"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 18 February 1985, Page 23&lt;/ref&gt; eight sons (Heah Hock-Khoon, Heah Hock-Soon, Heah Hock-Lye, Heah Hock-Meng, Heah Hock-Thye, Heah Hock-Aun, Heah Hock-Hin, Heah Hock-Heng), three daughters (Beng-Hong, Phee-Hong, Kwee-Hong), one son-in-law, six daughters-in-law and 15 grandchildren to mourn his loss.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 15 May 1962, Page 20&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to many, Joo Seang has a second wife. Her name is Eu Phooi Chen. It was quite common at that time for wealthy men to have more than one wife. It was during the period of the Japanese occupation of Malaya when Phooi Chen had borne him two sons namely Paul Heah Hock Teik (born 1943) and Jeffrey Heah Hock Hai (born 1944).&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Ong, "Fortitude: The life and times of Heah Joo Seang" 2014 Page 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

About a thousand people gathered at the Penang Bayan Lepas airport to receive his body which was flown back from London.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 20 May 1962, Page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

His family had decided to follow the old custom concerning death that happens outside of a person's home – when a person dies outside of his home, he cannot be brought back into the house. Accordingly, when he was welcomed at the airport, they did so as if he were still alive. There was no weeping and no black clothes or other signs of mourning until his body was back at his mansion, "Goodwood," in Macalister Road, and his death then announced by a representative of the family. His body was borne in a coffin draped in red and was accompanied by a motorcade nearly five (5) miles long.&lt;ref name="ST27May1962p10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 19 May 1962, Page 9&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement of his death was made by Rev. Soo Hneah Hee Seong, a "kee-tong" (medium), after which the mourning officially began. his body lay in state until Sunday, 21 May 1962 where it was removed for burial at the Kwangtung and Tengchow Cemetery at Mount Erskine.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 21 May 1962, Page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malaysian Chinese Association|Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA) national President, Tan Siew Sin said, the death of Heah Joo Seang left a gap that would be difficult to fill. "He was a tower of strength nor only to the MCA's central working committee but also the Penang organisation," the President wrote in a letter to Joo Seang's eldest son, Heah Hock-Khoon. "He infused new life into the Penang MCA and their loss is indeed a very grievous one... ...Apart from the MCA, the country will always remember him for his munificent gifts to charities and deserving institutions... ...I think it is only right that I should put these sentiments on record."&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 29 May 1962, Page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

La Sallean Brother Visitor T. Michael said the Christian Brothers had reason to grieve over the loss of a "great old boy and a very generous benefactor." He said that Joo Seang was unsparing in his attachment to his old school and worked towards its progress and improvement with genuine affection and loyalty. In referring to two new schools completed at Jalan Brother James and Kampong Bharu, he said, "These schools will stand as monuments to a public-spirited citizen whose departure leaves a gap which it will be very difficult to fill."&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 16 May 1962, Page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting on his funeral, the Straits Times noted, "Crowds swelling to well over 50,000 lined an eight-mile route today for the funeral of the late Mr. Heah Joo Seang, millionaire rubber magnate and Penang MCA President, whose body was flown home last week from London where he died on May 14. The two-mile procession in which 15 associations and 12 schools took part, was the longest seen in Penang for many years. 5,000 people. Three Cabinet Ministers together with the Governor of Penang, [[Raja Uda Raja Muhammad|Raja Tun Uda Al-Haj]], and the Chief Minister, Inche Aziz Ibrahim, were among the 5,000 people who followed the hearse on its last journey. Early arrivals were Tun [[Leong Yew Koh]], Minister of Justice, Mr. Tan Siew Sin, Minister of Finance and National President of the MCA, Dato [[Ong Yoke Lin]], Minister of Health and Social Welfare, and Mr. Cheah Theam Swee, assistant Minister of Commerce and Industry. The Prime Minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman|Tengku Abdul Rahman]], the Deputy Prime Minister, [[Tun Abdul Razak]], and the Governor, Raja Tun Uda Al-Haj, were among those who sent wreaths. Crowds started to gather from an early hour. Before the procession lined up, the coffin was taken out of the Heah mansion, Goodwood, in Macalister Road, and laid on the lawn where representatives of various schools and organisations paid their last respects to the late Mr. Heah. Mr. Yeo Hui Tung, a leader of the Teochew community, then read out an eulogy. Although timed to start at 11.30 a.m., the procession could not get moving until 12.15 p.m. Led by Senator Cheah Seng Khim and other members of the funeral committee, it proceeded along Macalister Road to the Church of Seven Sorrows where the first stage of the procession broke up. 'Last look.' It re-assembled later in front of the Teochew Association at Chulia Street and made its way to Beach Street to give the late Mr. Heah a "last look" at his office, Hock Lye Co., Ltd. The hearse, followed by 200 cars, then proceeded to [[Mount Erskine]] Cemetery where the burial took place at 5. p.m. after full Buddhist rites. Three school bands—St. Xavier's corps of drums and the Han Chiang and Jit Sin High School bands—marched with the procession. Among the 15 political parties, local guilds and associations which took part were UMNO and MCA youths, MCA women, UMNO and [[Malaysian Indian Congress|MIC]] members, the Teochew Hoay Kuan, the Kwangtung and Tengchow Associations, the [[Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce|Chinese Chamber of Commerce]] and the [[Rubber Trade Association of Penang|Penang Rubber Trade Association]]. Flags of various clubs and associations with which the late Mr. Heah was actively connected flew their flags at half-mast today."&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 28 May 1962, Page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

A Heah Joo Seang Scholarship Fund was set up in his memory, his family contributing $10,000 to get the fund going.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 26 May 1962, Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He was Managing Partner of Hin Giap, the largest rubber exporter in Penang, and one of the biggest employers of labour of Malaya in 1931;&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884–1942), 2 February 1931, Page 10&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman of Amalgamated Amusements (1932–1937); Chairman of Lam Seng Cheong (Ipoh); Chairman of Synn Cheong and Company (Taiping); Director of Khiam Seng Trading Company (Ipoh); Director of Kim Hin Company; and owner of Heah Joo Seang Rubber Estates.&lt;ref name="Lee &amp; Chow 2007, 50-51"/&gt; He was also the Proprietor of the Wembley Dance Hall, Penang.&lt;ref&gt;Manicasothy Saravanamuttu, (2010) The Sara Saga, Penang: Acrea Books, Pags 85 &amp; 216&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a notice in the Straits Times in August, Joo-Seang had bought from the Federation's Custodian of Property, about 26,000 acres of rubber estate land in Johore, at $6,000,000, by the start of October 1951. The transaction was the biggest of its kind up to that time involved property in the Kota Tinggi area and included Pengerang (4,632 acres), Senti (7,711), Belungkor (813), Telok Sengat (8,173), Sungei Ambok (843), Nanyo (3,089), Asahi (1,079), Sungei Seluyut (574), Tanjong Buai (132), and Buntu (425).&lt;ref name="ST23Dec1952p14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 6 October 1951, Page 4&lt;/ref&gt; This, on top of everything else he had done, pushed him to the forefront of the rubber business. He also actively led the industry to resolve issues. In February 1951 he convened and presided over a meeting of Penang merchants, both European and Asian, at the [[Rubber Trade Association of Penang|Penang Rubber Exchange]] to address the breakdown in discussions between the Penang Employers' Association and the owners of local lighters, the latter of whom were demanding a 25 percent increase in rates. The breakdown between the parties had negatively affected the trade of Penang. The matter, now being brought back to the table was resolved, and trading resumed.&lt;ref name=ST25Feb1951p15/&gt;

He advocated finding new uses for natural rubber including laying rubber roads and rubber flooring in offices.&lt;ref name="ST23Dec1952p14"/&gt;

At a dinner hosted by the Penang Rubber Trade Association on 18 March 1961 to celebrate his [[Order of the Defender of the Realm|Johan Mangku Negara]] award from the King, Joo Seang, then still the President of the association, said he would still be engaged in the rubber trade if he had to live his life over. "It is a fascinating game in which one has to pit one's brains against the world." He had been connected to the organisation for a long time, having first served that body as Honorary Secretary, forty (40) years earlier.&lt;ref name="The Straits Times, 21 March 1961, Page 6"&gt;The Straits Times, 21 March 1961, Page 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 11 March 1961, Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Reid Commission===
On August 1956, Heah Joo Seang hosted a dinner at his residence (the Goodwood mansion) in MacAlister road, Georgetown, Penang, in honour of the visit of Lord William Reid. Lord Reid was the Chairman of the Commission which was set up in England for the purpose of drafting and defining the Constitution of the Federation of Malaya. During his dinner speech, Lord Reid said, "We intend to do our utmost to leave some trace of your devotion to this Country in the shape of the Constitution", in reference to Joo Seang's championing of the rights of the straits born Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 11 August 1956, Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The drafting of the Constitution of the Federation of Malaya began the process toward the establishment of a new Government, after England agreed to concede independence to Malaya. The Commission was set up in March 1956 to seek "the views of political parties, non-government organization and individuals on the form of government and racial structure appropriate to this Country".

===Onn Jaafar supporter===
Joo Seang was a strong supporter of Malayan politician Sir [[Onn Jaafar]], founder of the [[United Malays National Organisation]] and Chief Minister of [[Johore]]. When the latter was facing political attacks, shortly after the Onn retired as Member for Home Affairs and Chairman of the Rural and Industrial Development Authority, Joo Seang, said in his defence, "Sir Onn has been falsely accused of being anti-Chinese. He has been severely criticised by some so-called Malay leaders who only want to gratify their own selfish ends."&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 8 February 1955, Page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==

As a regular source of news and information HVG has a significant influence on business decision makers and other stakeholder groups. With its editorial office in [[Budapest]], HVG provides objective information about domestic and international politics, economy and society. Capitalizing on its all-round column structure HVG puts great emphasis on the presentation of public issues and their context, besides reporting of recent events in cultural life and news from science and technology.

HVG's online news portal '''[http://hvg.hu/ hvg.hu]''' which is available on all platforms: mobile, tablet, android and iOS applications. With its news and analyzes HVG reaches more than 1.5 million people every week on its various print and digital platforms.
[[File:HVG 2018 24.png|thumb|HVG weekly cover page 2018/33]]
Ever since its foundation HVG stands for independent journalism and free expression. In April 2018, HVG launched a supportive [https://tagsag.hvg.hu/ membership program] in which readers who join the HVG community can, in return for their financial support, enjoy many benefits in addition to diverse, independent and factual information.

==History and profile==
The magazine was very important in the years spanning the [[Revolutions of 1989|transition from communism]] in airing new ideas and challenging boundaries.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=The press in Hungary|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3616011.stm|date=29 April 2004|accessdate=10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period it was also a leading [[Investigative journalism|investigative]] publication.&lt;ref name=sip&gt;{{cite journal|author=Balazs Sipos|title=Bias, partisanship, journalistic norms and ethical problems in the contemporary Hungarian political media|journal=Central European Journal of Communication|date=2013|volume=7|issue=1|url=http://ptks.pl/cejc/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CEJC_Vol7_No1_Sipos.pdf|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; HVG Publishing Co. was founded in 1989. In 2003 Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung ([[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung|WAZ]]) acquired 75% of the magazine.&lt;ref name=sip/&gt; In 2014 WAZ (Funke) redeemed its majority stake, which was bought back by former HVG shareholder, management and editorial staff, and HVG was again in Hungarian hands. In response to changes in the market, digital content gained more and more importance within HVG Publishing's activities, and the product portfolio continued to expand. Apart from the weekly magazine and its specials, annexes and numerous professional or entertaining periodicals, HVG Publishing Co. has become one of the largest book publishers in Hungary, while conferences, seminars or even the largest Hungarian Job Fair continue to color the Publisher's product range.

Political and power measures in the second half of the 2010s are increasingly breathing air from market-based media companies and increasingly discouraging the survival of independent journalism. In this hostile market environment HVG's goal and mission remains to provide independent and factual information to readers. The slogan of HVG also expresses this mission while reflecting on the current situation. '''''’[https://tagsag.hvg.hu/ Darkness does not last forever]’''''', along with the statement '''''’Let there be light’''''', with which HVG encourages and sympathizes with its readers, reminiscing of the first years spent in an almost ’half-illegitimacy’ under the socialist regime.

The politics that undermine independent press and the expansion of international social media and search giants ''(Facebook, Google)'' in the advertising market puts under unprecedented pressure HVG’s business model built on copy sales and advertisements. HVG has launched a [https://tagsag.hvg.hu/ Membership Program] in April 2018, whereby readers who join the HVG community can enjoy many benefits in return for their financial support in addition to diverse, independent and factual information.

Some articles are also available online and in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European media sources |work=Central European University Business School'' |url=http://www.ceubusiness.org/index.php?page=714&amp;l=1 |accessdate=10 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502215814/http://www.ceubusiness.org/index.php?page=714&amp;l=1 |archivedate=2 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HVG cover pages==
HVG's iconic cover pages always work on one of the main themes of the week, mostly depicting ironic humor. In the 80's, headlines were mostly not photos, but graphics featuring suggestive hints. These covers intended to affect the sense of humor of readers sensitive to the criticism of the ruling political system. After the change of regime, cover pages became partly more concrete, and partly continued the earlier tradition.

'''James Caan''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (born '''Nazim Khan''', 28 December 1960) is a [[British Pakistanis|British-Pakistani]] [[entrepreneur]] and television personality.

He is best known as a former investor on the BBC television programme ''[[Dragons' Den (UK)|Dragons’ Den]]'', in which he was one of the Dragons from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/about/history.shtml|title=History of the Den|publisher=[[BBC Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, he has hosted ''The Business Class'' on [[CNBC]], a series which sees him joined by experts from a cross-section of industries to analyse and advise innovative UK [[small and medium enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/49037243|title=The Business Class|publisher=[[CNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also Chairman of the UK Government's [[Start Up Loans Scheme]], which supports entrepreneurs with funding and mentoring to start their own business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2312176/|title=Former Dragons' Den judge James Caan helps 3,000 young entrepreneurs roar|publisher=MailOnline|date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caan initially achieved success in the recruitment industry, founding the recruitment company Alexander Mann in 1985, which he sold in 2002. In 1993, he co-founded the executive head-hunting firm Humana International, in which he sold his stake in 1999. He is also the founder and current CEO of the UK-based private equity firm [[Hamilton Bradshaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/smallbusiness/article-3610338/|title=Ex-Dragon James Caan's Start-up Secrets: I'm happy to admit I’ve had many failures throughout my career - accepting failure is as important as being successful'|publisher=MailOnline|date=30 May 2016|author=Eleanor Lawrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, he was named Chairman of the Year at the International Business Awards.&lt;ref name=bip&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiponline.co.uk/bip/james-caan-awarded-chairman-of-the-year-at-the-2013/|title=James Caan awarded Chairman of the Year at the 2013…|date=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caan has been involved in a number of charitable activities and founded the James Caan Foundation in 2006.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], Pakistan, Caan's family emigrated to the United Kingdom when he was two years old. His father came to the UK without any money or knowing the language but was able to build a successful business from scratch. He subsequently established a clothing company in [[Brick Lane]], east London. Caan's father had intended him to join the family business once his formal education was completed, but Caan decided he wanted to find his own way in the world. At 16, before he had begun his [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-Levels]], he left home and moved to a flat in [[Kensington]]. This led to Caan's being estranged from his father for many years.&lt;ref name=mirror13216/&gt;

Other than a Saturday job at Mr Buyright, Caan had no formal experience of work and so went to a recruitment agency to find some. His first job was door to door sales, which he found tiring. At this point, he knew he wanted to work in an office. He went back to the recruitment agency and asked for something that was indoors and saw a job working for [[Grand Metropolitan]]. He worked for several recruitment companies and started a fashion boutique with his wife before deciding he wanted to start his own company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Real Deal: My Story from Brick Lane to Dragons' Den|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|author=James Caan|year=2008|isbn=9781905264452|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DaQnAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caan started his own recruitment company in the early 1980s. His first office was in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] but was so small that the door could not be fully opened as it was blocked by his desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startups.co.uk/james-caan.html|title=James Caan The Dragons’ Den panellist on gap years, what makes the ideal investment and his unwavering obsession with windows|publisher=[[UK Startup Awards]]|date=17 April 2008|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He purposely chose the prestigious address to add credibility to his business.&lt;ref name="telegraphjun13"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/10106803/James-Caan-To-succeed-you-have-to-be-ready-to-lose.html|title=James Caan: 'To succeed, you have to be ready to lose'
|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|first=Ewing|last=Sarah|date=9 June 2013|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- As he had no meeting rooms, client meetings would often take place in coffee shops, and he would tell them that they were so busy that all the rooms were full. At this time he also changed his name from Nazim Khan to James Caan after seeing a film by the [[James Caan|famous actor]] and an alternative way to spell “Khan”; this also helped him in his recruitment company, as the name was more easily recognisable.&lt;ref name=mailwife/&gt; --&gt;

Caan did not excel at school and did not attend university as an undergraduate, but graduated from the 7-week Advanced Management Program at [[Harvard Business School]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/yourbusiness/3161421/How-money-stopped-mattering-for-Dragons-Den-mogul-James-Caan.html|title=How money stopped mattering for Dragons' Den mogul James Caan|author=Celia Walden|date=8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Business===
He founded the recruitment company Alexander Mann in 1987. In 1993 Caan co-founded the executive headhunting firm Humana International with Doug Bugie, eventually growing the business to over 147 offices in 30 countries. In the same year, Caan launched the trade magazine ''Recruitment International'', which he later sold in 2000. In 1996 Caan co-founded the business process outsourcing company AMS with Rosaleen Blair. Caan subsequently sold his interests in AMS in 2002. In 1999, Caan sold Humana International to CDI International, a New York listed company. Later in that year, Caan sold a minority stake in Alexander Mann Group to private equity firm [[Advent International]].

In 2002 Caan sold his interests in Alexander Mann, which by that time had a turnover of around £130m. In 2004 Caan established the London-based private equity firm, Hamilton Bradshaw. Hamilton Bradshaw is an investment group that specialises in Seed Capital and Growth Capital for recruitment businesses. Hamilton Bradshaw has invested in more than 30 portfolio businesses across 46 offices in the UK, and in 2014 reported more than £300 million in turnover.&lt;ref name=bip/&gt; Recruitment Entrepreneur is the Seed Capital arm of Hamilton Bradshaw which provides the seed funding and support for ambitious, experienced recruitment professionals to start, or scale, their own recruitment ventures. In June 2013, Caan gave an interview in which he criticised parents who aid their children with finding jobs and don't let them 'stand on their own two feet', he was accused of hypocrisy when it emerged that he had employed his own daughter in one of his companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/04/james-caan-daughters-nepotism|title=James Caan: social mobility tsar denies nepotism but employs his daughter|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 June 2013|author=Peter Walker|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caan responded that his daughter's recruitment process had been "rigorous", and stated that the outburst around this revelation would not detract from his six-month effort to campaign for a breakdown of employment barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22716241|title=TV experts turned tsars: How did they do?|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=6 June 2013|author=Brian Wheeler}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview with [[The Independent]] Caan admitted, "‘I would find it very difficult not to help my child’".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/was-social-mobility-tsar-and-former-dragons-den-star-james-caan-right-to-give-his-kids-a-helping-8650320.html|title=Was social mobility tsar and former Dragons' Den star James Caan right to give his kids a helping hand?|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=7 June 2013|author=Chloe Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, he invested in the managed office provider Avanta, which he sold three years later to the private equity company Kenmore. In 2007 Hamilton Bradshaw acquired the recruitment specialist Eden Brown and Caan sold his remaining interest in Alexander Mann Group to [[Graphite Private Equity]] in a management buy-out led by Rosaleen Blair.

In 2009 Caan launched HBRIDA, with his then business partner Helen Reynolds (ex ACEO of the REC). HBRIDA worked with SME recruitment agencies to help them achieve growth and led them to an exit. Reynolds performed a management buyout of the business in March 2012.
In 2010 Caan launched The Entrepreneurs Business Academy and became a non–Executive Director of [[McCann (company)|McCann London]]. In 2011 Caan founded Hamilton Bradshaw Venture Partners. In 2012/13, Caan launched Hamilton Bradshaw Real Estate (HBRE) to invest in "disruptive property start-ups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primeresi.com/looking-for-the-next-rightmove-primeresi-meets-faisal-butt/14342/|title=Looking for the next Rightmove: PrimeResi meets Faisal Butt, property’s venture capitalist with the Caan-do attitude|publisher=PrimeResi|date=15 April 2013|author=Matt Crofton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Caan was recognised in the 2015 New Year Honours List, with a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to entrepreneurship and charitable services through the James Caan Foundation.

Caan, Chairman of Start Up Loans, which has supported thousands of people with funding and mentoring to start their own business was “delighted and privileged” to receive the accolade. This award is recognition for the 23,000 new businesses set up through the scheme as well as his philanthropic work which has helped thousands since the floods hit Pakistan in July 2010.

===Television===
In 2007 Caan joined the panel of ''Dragons' Den'' judges for the fifth series of the show. [[Hilary Devey]] replaced James Caan on Dragons Den in 2012.

Through his role on Dragons’ Den, Caan worked with [[Children in Need]] for many years. In 2008, Children in Need filmed a ‘Youth Dragons Den’. ‘Look for Loneliness’ was his initiative to help reduce bullying and get children to understand what it is like to feel isolated. Caan went on to work with Children in Need in 2009, helping to renovate a Community Centre for young people to visit before and after school.

In 2008, in aid of [[Comic Relief]], Caan teamed up with the other presenters of Dragons Den for a special edition of the programme titled ‘Victorians Dragons’ Den’. In December 2009 Caan joined the [[Sport Relief]] team on a four-day trip to Kenya.

In 2012, he was approached by CNBC to host The Business Class, a series which sees him joined by experts from a cross-section of industries, looking at the challenges and opportunities faced by UK SMEs. Each 30-minute episode featured an innovative business which was seeking guidance to help it grow in the marketplace. The popularity of the series saw it recommissioned for a second series in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2013/10/03/james-caan-to-host-business-series-on-cnbc-to-help-smes.html|title=James Caan To Host Business Series On CNBC To Help SMEs|publisher=CNBC|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public sector==
Caan has been involved with the British Government and their agencies on a number of initiatives related to UK business for many years.

===The Start Up Loans Company===
In May 2012, Caan was approached by the government to become Chairman of the ''[[Start Up Loans Scheme|Start Up Loans]]'' initiative. The aim is to support young people with funding and mentoring to start up new businesses in the UK. Over £112 million of loans were to be offered to 18- to 30-year-olds over a 3-year period. James and his board of entrepreneur ambassadors head up the government scheme, providing loans of around £2,500 to the 18- to 30-year-olds to start their own businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20892658|title=Start-up loans scheme expanded|publisher=BBC News|date=3 January 2013|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the goal of Start Up Loans was to help 1,000 businesses obtain government and private sector investments to fund these new ventures, however as of 2014, James Caan has helped provide funding and mentorship to more than 18,000 start ups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.james-caan.com/about-james/government/|title=Start Up Loans|publisher=james-caan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable activities==

===The James Caan Foundation===
Caan founded the James Caan Foundation (JCF) in 2006 after he took a ‘gap year’ to visit his homeland of Pakistan. The JCF supports charities in the UK and seeks to promote greater awareness of issues facing the developing world, with a primary focus on children's access to education and healthcare.

The JCF has funded the construction of a new school at his birthplace [[Lahore]], located in the eastern province of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]. Since first purchasing a barren plot of land and opening the 16-classroom school in 2005, the TCF School, named after Caan’s father, educates over 420 children aged between 5-11.&lt;ref name='asian image'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianimage.co.uk/news/10094374.James_Caan___If_anyone_wasn___t_going_to_make_it_then_I_should_have_topped_that_list__/|title=James Caan: 'If anyone wasn’t going to make it then I should have topped that list!'|publisher=''Asian Image''|date=7 December 2012|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 Pakistan floods===
In July 2010, Caan flew to Pakistan immediately after the [[2010 Pakistan floods|worst flooding in the country's history]] and personally purchased, prepared and delivered emergency food parcels to families in the Northern village of [[Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]].

Upon his return to the UK Caan partnered with [[UNICEF]] to provide urgent food, medical supplies and water and hygiene kits to 1,000 families in the affected area. Caan also undertook an extensive media outreach campaign and his trip was widely covered in national newspapers. After just two weeks, Caan had raised £100,000 for UNICEF. Caan and the James Caan Foundation subsequently undertook a project to rebuild a village in Pakistan, including schools, hospitals, homes and all infrastructure and water supplies. Aid agencies including UNICEF, [[Oxfam]], [[Islamic Relief]], [[Muslim Hands]] and [[Mosaic Foundation|Mosaic]] were also involved in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/7968856/James-Caan-the-Dragon-humbled-by-Pakistan-floods-disaster.html|title=James Caan: the Dragon humbled by Pakistan floods disaster|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caan drew criticism when he was caught on camera offering to buy a baby from a family that was a victim of the [[Pakistan flood|2010 Pakistan flood]]. Caan insisted the offer had been made with good intentions, but stated that he regretted the incident and described his behaviour as "clearly wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11605927|title=Dragons' Den James Caan 'regrets offer to buy baby'|publisher=BBC Online|date=22 October 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caan was later filmed saying: "If there's an opportunity to give a life a chance of survival, it's more an emotional response than a rational decision.", "What I have to remember is that I am here to build a village. That child belongs to that family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/dragons-den-tycoon-james-caan-1073489|title=Dragons' Den tycoon James Caan apologises after trying to buy baby on TV|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|date=23 October 2010|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Davison "Jay" Rockefeller IV''' (born June 18, 1937) is an American politician who served as a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[West Virginia]] (1985-2015). He was first elected to the Senate in 1984, while in office as [[List of Governors of West Virginia|Governor of West Virginia]] (1977–85). Rockefeller moved to [[Emmons, West Virginia]], to serve as a [[Volunteers in Service to America|VISTA]] worker in 1964 and was first elected to public office as a member of the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] (1966). Rockefeller was later elected West Virginia [[Secretary of State of West Virginia|Secretary of State]] (1968) and was president of [[West Virginia Wesleyan College]] (1973–75). He became the state's senior U.S. Senator when the long-serving Sen. [[Robert Byrd]] died in June 2010.

As a great-grandson of oil [[business magnate|tycoon]] [[John D. Rockefeller]], he was the only serving politician of the prominent six-generation [[Rockefeller family]] during his tenure in the [[United States Senate]]{{Explanation needed|reason=Winthrop Rockefeller and son Win Rockefeller served in office during Senator Rockefeller's tenure. Please clarify.|date=August 2018}} and the only one to have held office as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in what has been a [[Rockefeller Republican|traditionally]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] dynasty, though he too was originally a Republican until he decided to run for office in what was then a strictly Democratic state.&lt;ref&gt;Only Democrat in a staunchly Republican dynasty{{spaced ndash}}see John Ensor Harr and Peter J. Johnson, ''The Rockefeller Century: Three Generations of America's Greatest Family'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1988.

==Early life==
John Davison Rockefeller IV was born at [[New York Hospital]] in [[Manhattan, New York City]], to [[John D. Rockefeller III|John Davison Rockefeller III]] (1906–1978) and [[Blanchette Ferry Rockefeller|Blanchette Ferry Hooker]] (1909–1992), 26 days after the death of his patrilineal great-grandfather, [[John D. Rockefeller|John Davison Rockefeller Sr.]] (1839–1937). He is the grandson of [[John Davison Rockefeller Jr.]] Jay graduated from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in 1955. After his junior year at [[Harvard College]], he spent three years studying Japanese at the [[International Christian University]] in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20085411,00.html |title=Jay Rockefeller |publisher=''People'' |date=July 4, 1983 |first1=Cable |last1=Neuhaus |first2=Peter |last2=Carlson |accessdate=September 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Harvard in 1961 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Far Eastern Languages and History. He attended [[Yale University]] and did graduate work in Oriental studies and studied the [[Chinese language]].&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockefeller.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=b63f2b0e-06f3-4fda-90ac-6084b102644c |title=ROCKEFELLER TO ACCOMPANY CLINTON TO CHINA |publisher=rockefeller.senate.gov |date=June 19, 1998 |accessdate=September 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919104126/http://www.rockefeller.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=b63f2b0e-06f3-4fda-90ac-6084b102644c |archivedate=September 19, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wvculture"/&gt;

After college, Rockefeller worked for the [[Peace Corps]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], under [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]], where he developed a friendship with [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and worked as an assistant to Peace Corps Director [[Sargent Shriver]]. He served as the Operations Director for the Corps' largest overseas program, in the [[Philippines]]. He worked for a brief time in the United States Department of Far Eastern Affairs.&lt;ref name="wvculture"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/jayrock.html |title=John Davison Rockefeller, IV |publisher=''West Virginia Division of Culture and History'' |accessdate=September 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222165226/http://www.wvculture.org/history/jayrock.html |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his public service in 1964–1965 in the [[Volunteers in Service to America|Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)]], under President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], during which time he moved to [[Emmons, West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wvgazettemail.com/dailymailwv/daily_mail_features/jay-rockefeller-wv-toyota-plant-is-a-dream-realized-daily/article_efd1ea68-3c06-58aa-9f3e-3f604fb57cb0.html|title=Jay Rockefeller: WV Toyota plant is a dream realized (Daily Mail WV)|first=Sen.

Rockefeller, along with his son Charles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asiasociety.org/japan/charles-rockefellers-opening-speech|title=Charles Rockefeller's Opening Speech|author=|date=|website=asiasociety.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Trustee of New York's [[Asia Society]], which was established by his father in 1956. He is also a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/news-releases/senator-jay-rockefeller-joins-cfr-distinguished-fellow|title=Senator Jay Rockefeller Joins CFR as Distinguished Fellow|author=|date=|website=cfr.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit [[think tank]] previously chaired by his uncle, [[David Rockefeller]]. As a Senator, he voted against the 1993 [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], which was heavily backed by David Rockefeller.

==State politics==
[[File:Jay Rockefeller giving a speech aboard the USS Stump, July 2, 1984.JPEG|thumb|left|150px|Governor Rockefeller giving a speech aboard [[USS Stump (DD-978)|USS ''Stump'']], July 1984.]]
Rockefeller was elected to the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] in 1966, and to the office of [[West Virginia Secretary of State]] in 1968. He won the Democratic nomination for governor in 1972, but was defeated in the general election by the Republican incumbent Governor [[Arch A. Moore, Jr.]]. Rockefeller then served as president of [[West Virginia Wesleyan College]] from 1973 to 1975.

Rockefeller was elected [[Governor of West Virginia]] in 1976 and re-elected in 1980. He served as governor when manufacturing plants and [[coal]] mines were closing as the national [[recession]] of the early 1980s hit West Virginia particularly hard. Between 1982 and 1984, West Virginia's [[unemployment]] rate hovered between 15 and 20 percent.

==U.S. Senate tenure==

===Elections===
In [[United States Senate election in West Virginia, 1984|1984]], he was elected to the [[United States Senate]], narrowly defeating businessman [[John Raese]] as [[Ronald Reagan]] easily carried the state in the presidential election. As in his 1980 gubernatorial campaign against Arch Moore, Rockefeller spent over $12 million to win a Senate seat. Rockefeller was re-elected in [[United States Senate election in West Virginia, 1990|1990]], [[United States Senate election in West Virginia, 1996|1996]], [[United States Senate election in West Virginia, 2002|2002]] and [[United States Senate election in West Virginia, 2008|2008]] by substantial margins. He was chair of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs|Committee on Veterans' Affairs]] (1993–1995; January 3 to 20, 2001; and June 6, 2001 – January 3, 2003). Rockefeller was the chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation (2009–2015).

Byrd, Senator Bob Dole, Senator Strom Thurmond, and former Senator Jennings Randolph, Vice President George H.W. Bush administers the oath of office for Senator John D. (Jay) Rockefeller.]]

=== Overview ===
In April 1992, he was the Democratic Party's finance chairman and considered running for the presidency, but pulled out after consulting with friends and advisers. He went on to strongly endorse Clinton as the Democratic candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=R. W. Apple Jr. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DA133FF933A25757C0A964958260 |title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Front-Runner; Like Voters, Superdelegates Have Doubts About Clinton |publisher=New York Times |date=April 10, 1992 |accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the Chairman of the prominent Senate [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence Committee]] (retiring in January 2009), from which he commented frequently on the [[war in Iraq]].

In 1993, Rockefeller became the principal Senate supporter, with [[Ted Kennedy]], behind Bill and [[Hillary Clinton]]'s [[Hillarycare|sweeping health care reform package]], liaising closely with the [[First Lady]], opening up his mansion next to Rock Creek Park for its first strategy meeting. The reform was subsequently defeated by an alliance between the [[Business Roundtable]] and a small-business coalition.&lt;ref&gt;The Clintons and health care reform{{spaced ndash}}see Haynes Johnson &amp; David S. Broder, ''The System: The American Way of Politics at the Breaking Point'', Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1996. (pp.32–34,50,227)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Rockefeller made an official visit to several [[Middle East]]ern countries, during which he discussed his personal views regarding United States military intentions with the leaders of those countries. In October of that year, Rockefeller strongly expressed his concern for [[Saddam Hussein]]'s alleged [[weapons of mass destruction]] program while addressing the U.S. Senate:

{{quote|There has been some debate over how "imminent" a threat Iraq poses. I do believe that Iraq poses an imminent threat, but I also believe that after [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], that question is increasingly outdated. It is in the nature of these weapons, and the way they are targeted against civilian populations, that documented capability and demonstrated intent may be the only warning we get. To insist on further evidence could put some of our fellow Americans at risk. Can we afford to take that chance? We cannot!&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web | title = Statement of Senator John D.

In November 2005 during a TV interview, Rockefeller stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I took a trip ... in January 2002 to [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]], and I told each of the heads of state that it was my view that [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] had already made up his mind to go to war against Iraq, that that was a predetermined set course that had taken shape shortly after 9/11.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rockefeller noted that the comment expresses his personal opinion, and that he was not privy to any confidential information that such action was planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,175433,00.html |title=Transcript: Sens. Roberts, Rockefeller on 'FNS' - FOX News Sunday &amp;#124; Chris Wallace |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=November 14, 2005 |accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 11, 2002, he was one of 77 Senators who voted for the [[Iraq Resolution]] authorizing the Iraq invasion.

In February 2010, regarding President Obama, Rockefeller said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;He says 'I'm for clean coal,' and then he says it in his speeches, but he doesn't say it in here ... And he doesn't say it in the minds of my own people. And he's beginning to not be believable to me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rockefeller faced criticism from West Virginia coal companies, which claimed that he was out of touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Raby|first1=John|last2=Smith|first2=Vicki|title=Jay Rockefeller Retiring: West Virginia Senator Won't Run Again When Term Ends In 2014|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/11/jay-rockefeller-resigns_n_2455812.html|accessdate=August 15, 2014|publisher=Huffington Post|date=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carte Goodwin with Jay Rockefeller.jpg|right|thumb|Rockefeller with fellow West Virginia Senator [[Carte Goodwin]].]]

Rockefeller became the senior [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[West Virginia]] when [[Robert Byrd]] died in June 2010, after serving in the senate with Rockefeller for 25 years.

In July 2011 Rockefeller was prominent in calling for U.S. agencies to investigate whether alleged [[News International phone hacking scandal|phone hacking]] at [[News Corporation]]'s newspapers in the United Kingdom had targeted American victims of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-13/sen-jay-rockefeller-seeks-u-s-agency-probes-of-news-corp-phone-hacking.html|title=Sen.

He announced on January 11, 2013, that he would not run for a sixth term.&lt;ref name=WAPOjan11 /&gt; On March 25, 2013, Rockefeller announced his support for [[gay marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Parnass | first = Sarah | title = Senators Abandon 'Discriminatory' DOMA Before Supreme Court Arguments | work = abcnews.go.com | publisher = ABC News | date = March 25, 2013 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/03/senators-abandon-discriminatory-doma-before-supreme-court-arguments/ | accessdate = September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Rockefeller donated his senatorial archives to the West Virginia University Libraries and the [[West Virginia &amp; Regional History Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WVU announces new school, gallery honoring Jay Rockefeller as his senatorial archives find 'forever home'|url=http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/n/2014/11/08/wvu-announces-new-school-gallery-honoring-jay-rockefeller-as-his-senatorial-archives-find-forever-home|website=WVU Today|publisher=West Virginia University|accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archival collection documents his 30-year career in the United States Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jay Rockefeller|url=https://rockefeller.lib.wvu.edu/|website=West Virginia &amp; Regional History Center|publisher=West Virginia University Libraries|accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committees===
Rockefeller served on the following committees in the [[112th Congress]]:

*'''[[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]]''' (Chairman)
**As chair of the full committee, Sen. Rockefeller may serve as an ''[[ex officio]]'' member of all subcommittees

==Political positions==

===Iraq War===
Rockefeller initially supported the use of force based upon the evidence presented by the intelligence community that linked Iraq to nuclear ambitions. After the [[Niger uranium forgeries]], in which the Bush administration gave forged documents to U.N. weapons inspectors to support allegations against Iraq, Rockefeller started an investigation into the falsification and exaggeration of evidence for the war. Through the investigations, he became an outspoken critic of Bush and the Iraq war. As chair of the Intelligence committee, he presided over a critical report on the Administration's [[Senate Report on Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq#Background|handling of intelligence and war operations]].

Rockefeller and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released the final two pieces of the Phase II report on Iraq war intelligence on June 5, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockefeller.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=298774 |title=Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) |publisher=Rockefeller.senate.gov |accessdate=July 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202055708/http://rockefeller.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=298774 |archivedate=December 2, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Rockefeller said, "The president and his advisers undertook a relentless public campaign in the aftermath of the attacks to use the war against Al Qaeda as a justification for overthrowing Saddam Hussein."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/06/world/middleeast/06intel.html|title=Bush Overstated Iraq Evidence, Senators Report|first=Mark Mazzetti and Scott|last=Shane|date=|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television violence===
In July 2007, Rockefeller announced that he planned to introduce legislation before the August Congressional recess that would give the FCC the power to regulate TV violence. According to the edition of July 16, 2007 of Broadcasting &amp; Cable, the new law would apply to both broadcast as well as cable and satellite programming. This would mark the first time that the FCC would be given power to regulate such a vast spectrum of content, which would include almost everything except material produced strictly for direct internet use. An aide to the senator said that his staff had also been carefully formulating the bill in such a way that it would be able to pass constitutional scrutiny by the courts.

===Telecommunications companies===
In 2007, Rockefeller began steering the Senate Intelligence Committee to grant [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies]] who were accused of unlawfully assisting the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) in monitoring the communications of American citizens (see [[Hepting v. AT&amp;T]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/19/nation/na-fisa19|title=Senate panel OKs spy measure |publisher= Los Angeles Times | work=Latimes.com |date=October 19, 2007 |accessdate=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was an about-face of sorts for Senator Rockefeller, who had hand-written a letter to [[Richard Cheney|Vice President Cheney]] in 2003 expressing his concerns about the legality of NSA's warrantless wire-tapping program. Some have attributed this change of heart to the spike in contributions from telecommunications companies to the senator just as these companies began lobbying Congress to protect them from lawsuits regarding their cooperation with the NSA.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ryan |last=Singel |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/10/dem-pushing-spy.html |title=Democratic Lawmaker Pushing Immunity Is Newly Flush With Telco Cash | work= Threat Level from Wired.com (blog) |publisher=wired.com |date= October 18, 2007|accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2001 and the start of this lobbying effort, AT&amp;T employees had contributed only $300 to the senator.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; After the lobbying effort began, AT&amp;T employees and executives donated $19,350 in three months.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; The senator has pledged not to rely on his vast fortune to fund his campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/external/pre-election/bios/437.html?SITE=NCGRDELN&amp;SECTION=POLITICS&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |title=Election 2008  |publisher=Hosted.ap.org |accessdate=July 13, 2010 |archivedate= December 10, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210230929/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/external/pre-election/bios/437.html?SITE=NCGRDELN&amp;SECTION=POLITICS&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the AT&amp;T contributions represent about 2% of the money he raised during the previous year.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

===Torture===
Although publicly deploring torture, Rockefeller was one of two Congressional Democrats briefed on [[waterboarding]] and other secret CIA practices in the early years of the Bush Administration, as well as the existence of taped evidence of such interrogations ([[2005 CIA interrogation tapes destruction|later destroyed]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockefeller.senate.gov/news/2007/pr120607a.html |publisher=U.S. Senate website |title=Chairman Rockefeller Statement on the CIA Decision to Destroy Tapes of Early Detainee Interrogations |date=December 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 11, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071213104052/http://rockefeller.senate.gov/news/2007/pr120607a.html |archivedate = December 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, Rockefeller opposed a special counsel or commission inquiry into the destruction of the tapes, stating "it is the job of the intelligence committees to do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hyL3au-RZxEcch2P9ymXaJ9mroogD8TER1IO0 |title=White House Stays Quiet on CIA Tapes |author=Calvin Woodward |agency=Associated Press |date=December 10, 2007 |accessdate=December 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070609092030/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hyL3au-RZxEcch2P9ymXaJ9mroogD8TER1IO0 |archivedate=June 9, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2006, Rockefeller voted with a largely Republican majority to suspend [[habeas corpus]] provisions for anyone deemed by the Executive Branch an "unlawful combatant," barring them from challenging their detentions in court. Rockefeller's vote gave a retroactive, nine-year immunity to U.S. officials who authorized, ordered, or committed acts of torture and abuse, permitting the use of statements obtained through torture to be used in military tribunals so long as the abuse took place by December 30, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0609290178sep29,1,1387725.story |title=Tribunal bill OKd by Senate |publisher=Chicago Tribune |author1=William Neikirk |author2=Andrew Zajac |author3=Mark Silva |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=September 29, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rockefeller's vote authorized the President to establish permissible interrogation techniques and to "interpret the meaning and application" of international [[Geneva Convention]] standards, so long as the coercion fell short of "serious" bodily or psychological injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/29/washington/29detain.html |title=Senate Passes Broad New Detainee Rules |publisher=New York Times |date=September 28, 2006 |accessdate=December 10, 2007 | first=Kate | last=Zernike}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/politics/4223241.html |title=Senate OKs detainee interrogation bill |agency=Associated Press |author=Anne Plummer Flaherty |date=September 28, 2006 |accessdate=September 29, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill became law on October 17, 2006.

===2008 presidential election===
On February 29, 2008, he endorsed [[Barack Obama]] for President of the United States, citing Obama's judgment on the Iraq war and national security issues, and calling him the right candidate to lead America during a time of instability at home and abroad. This endorsement stood in stark contrast to the results of the state primary that was easily won by [[Hillary Clinton]].

On April 7, 2008 in an interview for [[The Charleston Gazette]], Rockefeller criticized [[Early life and military career of John McCain#Vietnam operations|John McCain's Vietnam experience]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;McCain was a fighter pilot, who dropped laser-guided missiles from 35,000 feet. He was long gone when they hit. What happened when they get to the ground? He doesn't know. You have to care about the lives of people. McCain never gets into those issues.&lt;ref&gt;"Jay Defends Endorsement of Sen. Obama" ''Charleston (WV) Gazette'', 2008-04-08. wvgazette.com.  (fee required).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Apr08/0,4670,McCainRockefeller,00.html "Rockefeller Apologizes for McCain Remark"] ''FoxNews''.com (AP) 2008-04-08. Retrieved 2010-11-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The McCain campaign called for an apology from Senator Rockefeller and for [[Barack Obama]], whom Rockefeller endorsed, to denounce the comment. Rockefeller later apologized for the comment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.register-herald.com/local/local_story_099204606.html |title=Rockefeller apologizes to McCain over Vietnam service comment |publisher=''Register-herald''.com, Beckley WV |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Obama campaign issued a statement expressing Obama's disagreement with the comment. Senator [[Lindsey Graham]] (R) of South Carolina noted that "John didn't drop bombs from 35,000 feet. ... the bombs were not laser guided (in the 1960 and 1970s)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/04/08/rockefeller-apologizes-for-saying-mccain-doesnt-care-about-lives-of-war-bystanders/ After Rockefeller Insult, McCain Camp Claims Obama Won't Shut Down Campaign Smears - America's Election HQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409171023/http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/04/08/rockefeller-apologizes-for-saying-mccain-doesnt-care-about-lives-of-war-bystanders/ |date=April 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cybersecurity===
On April 1, 2009, Rockefeller introduced the [[Computer security#Cybersecurity Act of 2010|Cybersecurity Act of 2009 - S.773]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100617124555/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s773/text  full text]) before Congress. Citing the vulnerability of the Internet to cyber-attacks, the bill makes provisions to turn the Department of Commerce into a public-private clearing house to share potential threat information with the owners of large private networks. It authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to sequester any information deemed necessary, without regard to any law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c111:1:./temp/~c111b4Mr6Z:e49464: |title=Cybersecurity Act of 2009 Sec. 14 |publisher=Library of congress |author=Senator John D. Rockefeller |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=June 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also authorizes the president to declare an undefined "cyber-emergency" which allows him to shut down any and all traffic to what he considers to be a compromised server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c111:1:./temp/~c111b4Mr6Z:e54375: |title=Cybersecurity Act of 2009 Sec. 18 |publisher=Library of congress |author=Senator John D. Rockefeller |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=June 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2011, Rockefeller sponsored the fourth West Virginia Homeland Security Summit and Expo. The event ran two days and focused on homeland security with Rockefeller emphasizing cybersecurity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120310152523/http://www.wsaz.com/news/headlines/Homeland_Security_a_Major_Focus_for_Agencies_across_West_Virginia__122995288.html?ref=288 Homeland Security a Major Focus for Agencies Across W.Va.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
In 1997, Rockefeller co-authored  the Children's Health Insurance Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockefeller.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=281817|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603151738/http://rockefeller.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=281817|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 June 2011|title= ROCKEFELLER CHILDREN'S HEALTH BILL PASSES SENATE|author=|date=2 August 2007|website=rockefeller.senate.gov|via=archive.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CHIP) – a program aimed at giving low-income children health insurance coverage. Annually, CHIP has been successfully covering about 6 million children, who otherwise would have been uninsured. On September 30, 2007, the program expired, requiring Congress to reauthorize the legislation. On August 2, 2007, the vote for reauthorization passed legislation by a strong, bipartisan vote (68-31).

Recognizing the importance of long-term care for the nation's veterans, Rockefeller authored successful legislation that required the Department of Veterans Affairs, for the first time, to provide a wide range of extended care services—such as home health care, adult day care, respite care, and hospice care—to veterans who use the VA health care system.

Rockefeller is also a strong supporter of the fight against Alzheimer's and neurological disease.  The Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute (BRNI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brni.org|title=Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute - School of Medicine - West Virginia University|author=|date=|website=brni.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in Morgantown in 1999 by Rockefeller and his family to help advance medical and scientific understanding of Alzheimer's and other diseases of the brain. BRNI is the world's only non-profit institute dedicated exclusively to the study of both human memory and diseases of memory. Its primary mission is to accelerate neurological discoveries from the lab, including diagnostic tools and treatments, to the clinic to benefit patients who suffer from neurological and psychiatric diseases. A $30 million state-of-the-art BRNI research facility was opened at West Virginia University in Fall 2008. The approximately {{convert|80,000|sqft|m2}} three-level building will house 100 scientists by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wvumedicine.org/rni/who-we-are/the-rockefeller-family/|title=The Rockefeller Family and the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute - WVU Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute|author=|date=|website=wvumedicine.org|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Healthcare Reform, Rockefeller has been a proponent of a [[Public health insurance option|public option]], fighting with some Democrats on the finance committee, in particular [[Max Baucus]], the chairman of the committee, who contended that there was not enough support for a public option to gather the 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster. Baucus asked repeatedly for Rockefeller to stop speaking on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/29/AR2009092903063.html |title=Washington Sketch: Democratic Fratricide Begins |publisher=Washington Post |author=Dana Milbank |date=September 30, 2009 |accessdate=September 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2009 Rockefeller offered an amendment to the [[Baucus Health Bill]] in the Senate Finance Committee to add a public option. The amendment was rejected 15 to 8, with five Democrats (Baucus, [[Kent Conrad]], [[Blanche Lincoln]], [[Tom Carper]], [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]]) and all Republicans voting no.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/health/policy/30health.html|title=Senators Reject Pair of Public Option Proposals |last=Pear|first=Robert|author2=Jackie Calmes|date=September 29, 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=October 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockefeller supported President Barack Obama's health reform legislation; he voted for the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] in December 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = U.S. Senate Roll Call Vote, H.R. 3950 | work = senate.gov | date = December 24, 2009 | url = https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00396 | accessdate = September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he voted for the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00105 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records Home &gt; Votes &gt; Roll Call Vote |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Since 1967, Rockefeller has been married to the former [[Sharon Percy Rockefeller|Sharon Lee Percy]], the [[Chief Executive Officer]] of [[WETA-TV]], the leading [[PBS]] station in the Washington, D.C., area, which broadcasts such programs as ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' and ''[[Washington Week]]''. She is a twin daughter of Senator [[Charles H. Percy|Charles Harting Percy]] (1919—2011) and Jeanne Valerie Dickerson.

Jay and Sharon have four children:
*John Davison "Jamie" Rockefeller V (born 1969)
*Valerie Rockefeller
*Charles Rockefeller
*[[Justin Rockefeller|Justin Aldrich Rockefeller]] (born 1979)

Jamie's wife, Emily, is the daughter of former [[National Football League|National Football League (NFL)]] Commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]]; John Davison Rockefeller VI was born to them on August 29, 2007. Before John VI's birth, they had two daughters, Laura Chandler Rockefeller (born c. 2000) and Sophia Percy Rockefeller (born c. 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news-register.net/page/content.detail/id/53082.html?nav=505 |first= Linda| last= Comins| title=Rockefellers Welcome Their First Grandson |date= September 15, 2007 | work = Wheeling New-Register }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rockefellers reside in Northwest Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://architectofthecapital.org/posts/2016/7/12/rockefeller-mansion-in-rock-creek-park|title=Check Out The Rockefeller Mansion in Rock Creek Park|author=|date=|website=architectofthecapital.org|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintain permanent residence in [[Charleston, West Virginia]]. They have a ranch in the [[Grand Teton National Park]] in [[Jackson Hole]], [[Wyoming]]. President [[Bill Clinton]], a friend of Rockefeller's, and the Clinton family vacationed at the ranch in August 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brozan |first=Nadine |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html |title=Chronicle |location=Jackson Hole (Wyo) |publisher=New York Times |date=July 12, 1995 |accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockefeller is related to several [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] supporters and former officeholders: his paternal grandmother [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller|Abigail Greene "Abby" Aldrich]] (1874—1948) was a daughter of [[Rhode Island]] Senator [[Nelson W. Aldrich|Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich]] (1841—1915). [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.|John Davison Rockefeller Jr.]] (1874—1960) and Abby's youngest son was banker [[David Rockefeller]] (1915—2017). David's brother [[Winthrop Rockefeller|Winthrop Aldrich Rockefeller]] (1912—1973) served as Governor of Arkansas (1967–71). Winthrop and David's brother [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller]] (1908—1979) served as Governor of New York (1959–73) and as [[Vice President of the United States]] (1974—77) under [[Gerald Ford]]. Jay is also a first cousin of Arkansas Lt. Governor [[Winthrop Paul Rockefeller]] (1948—2006).

{{nihongo|'''Kunihiko Iwadare'''|岩垂 邦彦|Iwadare Kunihiko|extra=August 15, 1857 - December 20, 1941}} was a Japanese businessman. A graduate of the [[Imperial College of Engineering]] (Kobu Daigaku) in [[Tokyo]], he worked as a [[telegraph]] engineer for the Japanese government.  He left [[Japan]] in 1886 and traveled to New York.  He was introduced to Charles Batchelor, an assistant of [[Thomas Edison]]. Iwadare was hired to work in an Edison facility in [[Manhattan]] at Goerck Street. Iwadare was transferred to [[Edison Machine Works]] in Schenetady, [[New York (state)|New York]] in January 1887.  

Iwadare returned to Japan, hoping to participate in building the electrical industry in Japan. He first joined Osaka Dento (Osaka Electric Lamp Company) as an electrical engineer, and after eight years resigned from his post to start his own business as a general sales agent in Japan for [[General Electric]] and [[Western Electric]] companies.&lt;ref name="Odagiri-Goto"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1895 [[Western Electric]] wished to expand their telephone equipment sales business in Japan and proposed a limited partnership with Iwadare.&lt;ref&gt;NEC 1984, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Their representative was [[Walter Tenney Carleton]].  Iwadare accepted the proposal and a new firm was created in August, 1898.  In 1899, changes to treaties between Japan and Western countries went into effect.  The limited partnership created in 1898 was restructured into the [[joint stock company]], Nippon Electric Co. Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;NEC 1984, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western Electric held 54% of the stock.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 1987, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Iwadare was named Managing Director of what is now known as  [[NEC Corporation]].  He became Chairman of the Board in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;NEC 1984, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Facussé remained the owner of Corporación Dinant, which owned over 22,000 acres of palm plantations in [[Bajo Aguán]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', September 15, 2011 [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/world/americas/honduras-land-conflicts-highlight-polarization.html?pagewanted=all In Honduras, Land Struggles Highlight Post-Coup Polarization]&lt;/ref&gt; Facussé was described in 2012 by [[Reporters without Borders]] as having, "a private militia that can count on support from the police and army to impose his will".&lt;ref name=RSF/&gt; Reporters without Borders previously had called upon Facussé to respond publicly after the president of La Voz de [[Zacate Grande]], a radio station involved in a land struggle against Facussé, was shot in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Offshore Leaks''' is the name of a report disclosing details of 130,000 offshore accounts in April 2013.

More than 100 journalists from more than 60 countries and dozens of news organizations have taken part in the investigation, which has since expanded to include revelations about the offshore holdings of China's business and political elites.

A German politician, [[Peer Steinbrück]], has called for harsh penalties for the banks involved in the scandal, up to the revoking of [[banking license]]s.&lt;ref name="Spiegel Steinbrück"&gt;{{cite news|title=Geschäfte in Steueroasen: Steinbrück fordert härtere Strafen für Banken|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/steueroasen-steinbrueck-fordert-haertere-strafen-fuer-banken-a-892557.html|accessdate=4 April 2013|newspaper=Spiegel}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICIJ reports that the series of stories has sparked "official investigations, sweeping policy changes and high-profile resignations" around the world, with the European Union’s top tax official calling Offshore Leaks “the most significant trigger” behind Europe’s new push to crack down on offshore hideaways and global tax dodging.&lt;ref name="icij.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icij.org/blog/2013/04/release-offshore-records-draws-worldwide-response|title=Release of offshore records draws worldwide response|work=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; “We're in a completely different context today” because of the Offshore Leaks revelations, Belgium’s secretary of state has said. “It’s a new world.”&lt;ref name="icij.org"/&gt;

IBC consultant Ryan Mohanlal responded that each enterprise, holding, corporation or entity which is registered has its own reasons for doing so and that there are legitimate reasons to incorporate in this form.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

In Brazil, ICIJ's criteria for selecting journalists has been criticized for lack of transparency. The journalists chosen by ICIJ are part of media conglomerates that could potentially have connections with offshore account owners. Claims that UOL (a joint venture between [[Grupo Abril]] and [[Folha de S. Paulo]]) and O Globo (from military dictatorship backers [[Grupo Globo]]) journalists might pick and disclose names according to political bias rather than public interest eventually led investigative reporter Amaury Ribeiro Jr. to leave the ICIJ.&lt;ref name="Viomundo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viomundo.com.br/denuncias/amaury-ribeiro-jr-deixa-o-comite-de-jornalistas-investigativos-com-suspeita-de-que-ele-investiga-um-lado.html|title=HSBC: Amaury Ribeiro Jr. deixa o Comitê de Jornalistas Investigativos - Viomundo - O que você não vê na mídia|date=19 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary data==
As of 15 June 2013 a searchable database which includes part of the data is available under the URL http://offshoreleaks.icij.org/. So far the full primary data set has not been made publicly available. 

There is no known connection between the ICIJ "Offshore Leaks" and "[[WikiLeaks]]".

A '''PhD-MBA''' or '''MBA-PhD''' is a [[double degree|dual degree]] program offered in some cases by schools of science, engineering or social science, jointly with [[business school]]s. The program generally lasts four to eight years and results in the candidate earning both a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree and a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degree. Students may apply to the joint program before matriculating to either program, or after matriculating to the PhD programme. The programme often attracts [[entrepreneur]]s and [[venture capitalist]]s.

Some of the leading PhD-MBA programs are offered by universities like:
* [http://graduate.wfu.edu/admissions/phdmba.html  The Wake Forest University PhD/MBA program] was established in 1999 and was the first of its type in the nation.

'''The Plants for Human Health Institute (PHHI)''' is a [[North Carolina State University]] research and education organization located at the [[North Carolina Research Campus]] in [[Kannapolis]], [[North Carolina]], United States. The institute researches food crops, like [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]], and the potential health-promoting properties they may convey when consumed.

PHHI is part of the [[North Carolina State University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]], which staffs the institute with faculty from the departments of horticultural science; food, bioprocessing and nutrition sciences; plant and microbial biology; genetics; and agricultural and resource economics.&lt;ref name="CALS report" /&gt; The institute has both research and [[Cooperative Extension]] components. [[Mary Ann Lila]], a [[blueberry]] researcher,&lt;ref name="MAL NYT" /&gt; is director of the Plants for Human Health Institute.&lt;ref name="NCRC" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:PHHI Building Oct2012.jpg|thumb|right|The Plants for Human Health Institute building at the N.C. Research Campus, Kannapolis, N.C.]]
N.C. State began operations in Kannapolis in 2007 as the Fruit and Vegetable Science Institute. The university was one of the first organizations to join the biotech hub.

The program's name was changed to Plants for Human Health Institute when the N.C. Research Campus was dedicated on October 20, 2008, in order "to more accurately reflect the groundbreaking research approach the institute will take. Institute research will focus on identifying and making available to consumers bioactive compounds in plants that prevent and treat disease."&lt;ref name="N.C. Research Campus dedication" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Research Campus institute gets home" /&gt;

As of May 2014, PHHI has about 50 faculty and staff in Kannapolis, not including seasonal staff.&lt;ref name="PHHI employees stat" /&gt;

== Research ==

=== Overview ===

Plants for Human Health Institute researchers study the potential health-promoting properties of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]].&lt;ref name="GrowingMag" /&gt; The institute employs six lead researchers and has plans to expand to 14 researchers.&lt;ref name="WRAL" /&gt;

The institutes mission is to discover and deliver plant-based solutions to improve human health, PHHI researchers target naturally occurring chemical compounds in plants and [[Produce|fresh produce]], known as [[phytochemicals]], some of which convey health-promoting properties when ingested. Institute director, Lila, and other PHHI researchers have done research into  phytochemicals, such as [[anthocyanins]] present in [[blueberries]] and other crops, indicating they provide health benefits against [[cancer]], [[diabetes]] and other [[Chronic disease|chronic human diseases]] when consumed.&lt;ref name="DrOz" /&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=yes|date=October 2014}}

In 2013, Lila was a lead researcher in a study involving athletes ingesting blueberry and green tea-infused drinks twice daily during a two-week supplementation period and then for three days of rigorous exercise. Among the results, participants experienced a prolonged spike in their metabolism (up to 14 hours) after exercise.&lt;ref name="berrystudy" /&gt;{{npsn|date= October 2014}}

[[Image:Perkins-Veazie raspberry research.jpg|thumb|left|Penelope Perkins-Veazie, postharvest physiologist with PHHI, evaluates food safety, quality and consumer-appeal characteristics, like flavor and color, for fruits and vegetables.]]

=== Programs ===

Plants for Human Health Institute researchers integrate expertise in [[biochemistry]], [[plant breeding]], [[epigenetics]], [[metabolomics]], [[pharmacogenomics]], [[postharvest physiology]] and [[systems biology]].&lt;ref name="PHHI" /&gt; PHHI research faculty have: 
* Led the team that sequenced the blueberry [[genome]].&lt;ref name="blueberry genome" /&gt; 
* Discovered evidence that plants of the [[Brassicaceae]] family (like [[mustard greens]] and [[kale]]) could increase muscle mass in people suffering from debilitating disease and the effects of aging.&lt;ref name="Plant Steroids" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clt Slavko" /&gt; 
* Developed functional food ingredients from health-enhancing plant compounds for undernourished populations in Africa.&lt;ref name="Gates" /&gt; 
* Created fruit-infused peanut flours to combat peanut allergies.&lt;ref name="Peanuts" /&gt; 
* Established multiple plant breeding programs, including broccoli,&lt;ref name="broccoli" /&gt; cabbage&lt;ref name="cabbage" /&gt; and strawberry.&lt;ref name="strawberry" /&gt;

=== Greenhouse Complex ===

[[Image:PHHI greenhouse complex.JPG|thumb|right|The Plants for Human Health Institute greenhouse complex in Kannapolis, N.C.]]The institute operates three [[greenhouses]]. At a cost of $340,000 the greenhouse complex provides about 10,000 square feet of space for plant trials on crops like [[broccoli]] and [[strawberry]], and allow the institute to rent space or collaborate on research with other campus operations and businesses.&lt;ref name="Greenhouses" /&gt;

Researchers also partner with the Piedmont Research Station, a research farm located near [[Salisbury, North Carolina|Salisbury]], N.C., to grow and test [[field crop]]s.&lt;ref name="Cabbage Program" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PRS" /&gt;

=== Kannapolis Scholars ===

Funded by a $1 million [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] – Agriculture &amp; Food Research Initiative (USDA-AFRI) the Kannapolis Scholars is a program for [[graduate students]] from multiple disciplines to participate in integrated research. Led by Jack Odle, William Neal Reynolds, Professor of Nutritional Biochemistry at N.C. State, the examines issuesin the broad domain of [[functional foods]], [[Bioactive plant food compounds|bioactive food components]] and [[human health]].&lt;ref name="KScholars" /&gt; 30 faculty members from eight universities in North Carolina act from multiple disciplines, including [[food science]], [[nutritional science]], [[plant science]], [[animal science]], [[microbiology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[metabolomics]] as mentors to the Kannapolis Scholars. Some are resident at the N.C. Research Campus while others are at the associated university campuses.&lt;ref name="KScholars2" /&gt;

=== Plant Pathways Elucidation Project (P2EP) ===

The Plant Pathways Elucidation Project, or P2EP, is a $1.9 million program that engaging college students from across North Carolina in education and research. Started in June 2013, the program is supported by a consortium of academic and industry organizations, including the Plants for Human Health Institute. The program teams university scientists, industry leaders and college students to explore plant health benefits, prepare student scientists to pursue careers in [[STEM fields]] (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), and create a research [[knowledge base]].&lt;ref name="CO-P2EP" /&gt;

The 2014 P2EP summer session includes doctoral candidates and graduate and undergraduate interns from 12 colleges and universities and two high schools in [[Cabarrus County]].&lt;ref name="P2EP" /&gt;

]]
The N.C. Cooperative Extension Service houses a multidisciplinary team at the N.C. Research Campus as part of the Plants for Human Health Institute. The team is an education and outreach component directed toward farm and agribusiness management, communications and marketing, and fresh produce safety.

=== Programs ===

In addition to and in partnership with PHHI research programs, the Cooperative Extension group coordinates educational and outreach efforts, secures grants and delivers practical applications of science-based research to strengthen the agriculture industry in North Carolina.

The N.C. Value-Added Cost Share Program (NCVACS), coordinated by the Cooperative Extension team at PHHI, provides assistance to agricultural operations in the form of cost share awards. The program has awarded more than $1 million to support [[agribusinesses]] in North Carolina since it began in 2009. The N.C. Tobacco Trust Fund Commission funds the program.&lt;ref name="SFN" /&gt;

The N.C. Cooperative Extension component of PHHI is a cooperative development center for the state, supported by the [[USDA Rural Development|U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development program]], the group works with producer groups and cooperatives to expand economic activity.&lt;ref name="RCDG" /&gt;

PHHI is home to the N.C. Fresh Produce Safety program, a program of the Cooperative Extension, established to educate fruit and vegetable growers about minimizing [[food safety]] risks. The program's training curriculum addresses [[Good Agricultural Practices|Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs)]].&lt;ref name="FPS" /&gt;

=== History ===

Blake Brown, Hugh C. Kiger Professor in agricultural economics at N.C. State, started the Program for Value-Added and Alternative Agriculture in 2006 with support from the N.C. Tobacco Trust Fund Commission. The program was originally created to assist the transition of tobacco-farm families to other profitable enterprises after the [[Tobacco Buyout]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="TTFC" /&gt;

As part of N.C. State's development of the N.C. Research Campus, the program relocated to Kannapolis in 2008 as an on-site Cooperative Extension complement to the research personnel and programs with the institute. The program operated under the N.C. MarketReady brand from October 2009 until July 2012.&lt;ref name="N.C. MarketReady name change" /&gt; The program has since dropped the name and been fully integrated into the institute as the N.C. Cooperative Extension component.

== N.C. Research Campus ==
{{main article|North Carolina Research Campus}}
[[Image:N.C. Research Campus aerial image.jpg|thumb|left|The N.C. Research Campus]]
The [[North Carolina Research Campus|N.C. Research Campus]] is a public-private venture including eight universities, one community college, the [[David H. Murdock Research Institute]] (DHMRI), the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) and corporate entities that collaborate to advance the fields of human health, [[nutrition]] and [[agriculture]]. It was founded by [[David H. Murdock]], CEO of [[Dole Foods]]. The campus is built upon the former site of the [[Cannon Mills|Cannon Textile Mill]] in [[Kannapolis]], about 30 miles north of [[Charlotte]].

The research campus represents an effort by the state of [[North Carolina]] to revitalize the region following the decline of the [[textile industry]]. The campus is supported mainly through annual funding from the state of North Carolina, federal research grants to university researchers located on the campus, and investment of real estate by Murdock, former owner of the Cannon textile mill that previously occupied the site.

It was announced in November 2013 that two new facilities were breaking ground at the Kannapolis campus, including a 50,000-square-foot data center (DataChambers) and a 100,000-square-foot municipal center (the new Kannapolis City Hall).&lt;ref name="groundbreaking" /&gt;

The Plants for Human Health Institute is housed on the campus in a 105,000-square-foot facility that includes research labs, lab support areas and an Advance II 700 US-2 Magnet [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscope.&lt;ref name="building" /&gt;

== Funding ==
The institute has received $2.1 million in gift donations and $7.8 million in federal and private competitive grants, $1.42 million from the N.C. Tobacco Trust Fund Commission, $2 million from the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]], $780,000 from the [[University of North Carolina]] General Administration, and $1.05 million from commodity groups and other private sponsors. This funding is in addition to state appropriations.&lt;ref name="CALS report" /&gt; PHHI research programs have also received significant grant funding support from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;ref name="Gates" /&gt; and the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref name="NIH" /&gt;

'''RETMAN''' is a comics’ character, associated to [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]] (REBT). Through it, REBT tries more efficiently address children, adolescents and the general public. This form of therapy approaches the treatment of [[emotional disorders]] and the promotion of mental health by modifying maladaptive/irrational behaviors and cognitions (thoughts).

== History and evolution ==
The first RETMAN concept was thought up at the Albert Ellis Institute, US, in the 80s (Calvin Merrifield and Rebecca Merriefield: Call Me Retman and Have a Ball, 1979) inspired by the name Rational Emotive Therapy (that is how this form of [[cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy]] was referred to then). The prototype for the superhero was [[Albert Ellis]] himself. As “RET-Man”, Ellis is arrested by the police but not before helping a depressed jilted lover give up his thoughts of suicide in favor of more rational thinking.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rebt.org/professionals/prof_articles/nardiwebarticle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, because of the high production costs at the time, the project was abandoned after the publication of a comic.

=== Present ===
The concept was resumed in 2008, with the approval of the Albert Ellis Institute by a team of Romanian psychologists and graphic designers led by Prof. Daniel David, with a modern technology. For the first time they also investigated the efficiency of the concept in promoting psychological health and in the treatment of psychological disorders in children and adolescents (see "Meet RETMAN" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychotherapy.ro/content/view/143/122/&lt;/ref&gt;). The team developed the RETMAN concept in an innovative way, creating an entire system that includes: (1) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=12 therapeutic comics]; (2) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=13 therapeutic stories]; (3) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=14 therapeutic cartoons]; and (4) the therapeutic system RoboRETMAN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://retman.ro/?page_id=15 RoboRETMAN ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Retman technology is being used by (selection) The Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinic, UMF, [[Cluj-Napoca]], the “PsyTech” University Psychological Clinic at Babes-Bolyai, Cluj-Napoca, kindergartens and private clinical psychology/counseling/psychotherapy practices in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clinicalpsychology.ro/en/innovations/3/&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also used on the REThink Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rethink.info.ro/ REThink Project]&lt;/ref&gt; a research grant with the goal to design, develop, and evaluate a therapeutic video game accessible over the Internet,  meant to be used primarily as a standalone application to promote emotional resilience in children and adolescents.

== Concept ==
The concept was resumed by a team of designers and psychologists at the International Institute for the Advanced Studies of Psychotherapy and Applied Mental Health (link), led by “Aaron T.Beck” professor [[Daniel David]]. The institute was co-founded by the Albert Ellis Institute and [[Babes-Bolyai University]]. The concept put forward by this team was a completely changed one, using the character [[Superman]] as a model for Retman. A planet was created for Retman (Rationalia), as well as new adventures and a dangerous opponent (the evil sorcerer Irationalius)
The stories of Retman are based on an original story, developed by dr. Daniel David: “...Retman was the ruler of Planet Rationalia from the System of Ataraxia in the Happiness Galaxy. He lived in a town called Equilibrium and was a Great Sorcerer Psychotherapist, who is a person who helps you when you suffer and teaches you how to be happy. The Great Sorcerer Psychotherapist practiced “Retmagic” (a rational-emotional therapeutic magic). This gift had been given to him by the Almighty Creator of the World. All the inhabitants of the planet were happy because they had everything they wanted, but mostly because they wanted only what they knew they deserved. The secret of their happiness was therefore their minds and their way of thinking. But while Retman fostered rational thinking on the planet, his enemy, the Sorcerer Irationalius became envious of his power and stole the minds of the inhabitants of the planet. They became mean and envious and the whole planet was overtaken by evil and despair. Then the Almighty Creator of the World, in anger, destroyed everyone, sparing just Retman, as he was the only person whose mind Irationalius could not steal. He was sent on Earth with the goal of teaching everyone here to be rational and happy, so they wouldn’t end up like the inhabitants of Rationalia...”
The stories of Retman have been published in Romanian and English.

'''Salamo Arouch''' ({{lang-el|Σολομόν Αρούχ}}; January 1, 1923 – April 26, 2009) was a [[Jewish Greeks|Jewish Greek]] [[Boxing|boxer]], the Middleweight Champion of Greece (1938) and the All-Balkans Middleweight Champion (1939), who survived the [[Holocaust]] by boxing (over 200 bouts) for the entertainment of [[Nazi]] officers in [[Auschwitz-Birkenau#The extermination camp: Auschwitz II (Birkenau)|Auschwitz]] Concentration Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barak |first=Roy |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/2.209/auschwitz-inmate-who-survived-by-boxing-dies-aged-86-1.275061 |title=Auschwitz Inmate Who Survived by Boxing Dies Aged 86 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; His story was portrayed in the 1989 film ''[[Triumph of the Spirit]]'', starring [[Willem Dafoe]] as Arouch.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{cite news|title=Salamo Arouch, Who Boxed for His Life in Auschwitz, Is Dead at 86|first=Dennis|last=Hevesi|date=May 3, 2009|accessdate=May 4, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/world/europe/04arouch.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atlas&gt;{{cite book | last = Atlas | first = Teddy |author2=Peter Kaminsky |author3=Peter Alson | title = Atlas: From the Streets to the Ring : a Son's Struggle to Become a Man | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-06-054240-3 | page = 141 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=IGBuHKuH49gC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=%22Salamo+Arouch%22 | quote = The movie was based on the true story of Salamo Arouch, a Greek Jew who was sent to Auschwitz during World War II and literally had to fight for his life in boxing matches with other concentration camp inmates.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Salamo Arouch was born in 1923,&lt;ref name=People/&gt; in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]], one of two sons in a family that also included three daughters.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; His father was a [[stevedore]] who nurtured his son's interest in boxing, teaching him when he was a child. He worked briefly with his father as a stevedore.&lt;ref name=People&gt;{{cite journal | title = Boxer Salamo Arouch's Death Camp Bouts End in a Triumph of the Spirit | journal = People Magazine | volume = 33 |issue = 7 | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116862,00.html | last = Schindehette | first = Susan |author2=Jack Kelley |author3=Mira Avrech | date = 1990-02-19 | accessdate = 2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arouch said that when he was 14, he fought and won his first amateur boxing match &lt;ref name=Berger&gt;{{cite news | last = Berger | first = Phil | title = Prisoner in the ring | work = The New York Times | date = 1989-12-18 | accessdate = 2008-11-22 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE3D71331F93BA25751C1A96F948260}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1937 in [[Maccabi Thessaloniki]], a Jewish youth center and gymnasium. He later won the Greek Middleweight Boxing Championship, and in 1939, won the All-Balkans Middleweight Championship, an achievement he was best known for. After compiling an undefeated record of 24 wins (24 knockouts),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/world/europe/04arouch.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Dennis | last=Hevesi | title=Salamo Arouch, Who Boxed for His Life in Auschwitz, Is Dead at 86 | date=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arouch joined the Greek Army. While in the military he raised his boxing record to 27 wins (27 knockouts).

===Entertainment at Auschwitz-Birkenau===
In 1943, Arouch and his family were transported by boxcar and interned in the Auschwitz-Birkenau [[concentration camp]] in present day Poland.&lt;ref name=People/&gt; They arrived on May 15, 1943. In Auschwitz, where Arouch was tagged prisoner 136954, he said the commander sought boxers among the newly interned and, once assured of Arouch's abilities, set him to twice- or thrice-weekly boxing matches against other prisoners.&lt;ref name=Berger/&gt;

According to Arouch, he was undefeated at Auschwitz, though two matches he was forced to fight while recovering from [[dysentery]] ended in draws.&lt;ref name=Berger/&gt; Lodged with the other fighters forced to participate in these matches and paid in extra food or lighter work, Salamo fought 208 matches in his estimation,&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite news|title=Boxer Fought for His Life at Auschwitz|first=Matt|last=Schudel|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/30/AR2009043003858.html|work=The Washington Post|date=May 1, 2009|page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt; knowing that prisoners who lost would be sent to the [[gas chamber]] or shot.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news | last = Taliabue | first = John | title = Fighting for life itself in a Nazi boxing ring | work = The New York Times | date = 1989-05-14 | accessdate = 2008-11-22 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DA1230F937A25756C0A96F948260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fights generally lasted until one fighter went down or the Nazis got tired of watching.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; Arouch claimed he weighed about 135 pounds and often fought much larger men. Once, he finished off a 250-pound opponent in only 18 seconds.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

===Release from the concentration camps===
Though Arouch survived the war, being released from Auschwitz on January 17, 1945, his parents and siblings did not. In 1945, he was transferred to Bergen-Belsen, where he worked performing slave labor until the allies liberated the camp.&lt;ref name="AzRep"&gt;Transferred to Bergen Belson in "Salamo Arouch, 86; Survived Auschwitz by Boxing", ''The Arizona Republic'', reprinted from the ''Los Angeles Times'', Phoenix, Arizona, p. 14, May 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=People/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; During a search for family at [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] in April, 1945, he met Marta Yechiel, a 17-year-old survivor from his own hometown.&lt;ref name=People/&gt; With Yechiel, he [[aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Israel]] and settled in [[Tel Aviv]], where he managed a shipping firm.&lt;ref name=People/&gt;&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite journal | last = Travers | first = Peter | title = Triumph of the Spirit | journal = Rolling Stone | year = 1989 |accessdate=2008-11-22| issue = 570 | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949233/review/5949234/triumph_of_the_spirit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arouch and Yechiel wed in November 1945 and raised a family of four.&lt;ref name=People/&gt;

After the war he gave inspirational speeches. Arouch's undefeated boxing record (1937–1955) ended on June 8, 1955, when he was knocked out in 4 rounds by Italy's Amleto Falcinelli in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name="AzRep" /&gt;

===Work on the biographical film, ''Triumph of the Spirit''===
Arouch was a consultant on the movie, ''Triumph of the Spirit'', the 1989 dramatic reenactment of his early life.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; He accompanied filmmakers several times on an emotional return to the concentration camp where large portions of the film were actually produced.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The film takes some artistic liberties with the biographical details of his life, including the renaming of his wife and placing her in his story prior to internment.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

After the movie came out, another Jewish boxer from Salonika, Jacques "Jacko" Razon, sued Arouch and the filmmakers for more than $20 million claiming that they had stolen his story and that Arouch had exaggerated his exploits. The case was later settled for $30 thousand.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

Arouch died on April 26, 2009, in Israel. He had been weakened by a stroke he suffered around 1994 and had been in declining health for six months prior to his death.&lt;ref name="AzRep" /&gt;

The '''Shorty Awards''', also known as the "'''Shortys'''", is an annual awards show recognizing the people and organizations that produce real-time short form content across [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Tumblr]], [[YouTube]], [[Instagram]] and the rest of the [[Social Web|social web]].

The awards are organized by public relations software company ''Sawhorse Media''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://sawhorsemedia.com|title=Sawhorse Media {{!}} Uncovering the best of the social web {{!}} Sawhorse Media|last=Media|first=Sawhorse| website=sawhorsemedia.com|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual ceremony began in 2008 with awards for achievements on the Twitter platform. Since then, the awards have expanded to recognize content creation on other [[social networking site]]s, including YouTube, Tumblr, Instagram, [[Vine (service)|Vine]], [[Snapchat]], [[YouNow]], [[Periscope (app)|Periscope]] and Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://mashable.com/2016/04/12/shorty-awards-2016/|title=5 moments from the Shorty Awards that show the power of new media|last=Khosla|first=Proma| website=Mashable|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An awards ceremony is held each spring and streamed live. Each award recognizes the entire body of work of the content creator for the calendar year, rather than an individual tweet or post. A 2012 ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine article about the awards commented: "The Shortys recognize that social media is about more than who can get the most followers ... we are creating millions of pieces of new writing that will define our generation. ... These writings ... are creating our history of record."&lt;ref&gt;Dube, Jon.

== First Annual Shorty Awards ==
The awards were created in 2008 by tech entrepreneurs Greg Galant, Adam Varga, and Lee Semel of Sawhorse Media.&lt;ref name="Holmes2"&gt;Holmes, Elizabeth: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123435724633872715/ "Surviving the Drama of the Twitter Awards"], ''The Wall Street Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neisser, Drew: [http://www.fastcompany.com/1671715/how-the-shorty-awards-become-the-oscars-of-social-media/ "How the Shorty Awards Became the Oscars of Social Media"], ''Fast Company''&lt;/ref&gt; They invited Twitter account holders to nominate the best Twitter users in general categories such as humor, news, food, and design.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Brad: [http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/from-the-twitterspere-tropies-for-the-best-tweets/ "From the Twittersphere: Trophies for the Best Tweets"], ''The New York Times'' Bits Blog&lt;/ref&gt; Winners were chosen by more than 30,000 Twitter users during the voting period.&lt;ref name="Holmes2" /&gt; The founders of Twitter first heard about the awards after the contest had gotten underway and expressed support for it.&lt;ref name="Holmes2" /&gt;

The first Shorty Awards ceremony was held on February 11, 2009, at the Galapagos Art Space in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]]. Approximately 300 people attended the event.&lt;ref&gt;Otterman, Sharon: [http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/the-scene-at-the-twitter-awards-chatter/ "The Scene at the Shorty Twitter Awards: Chatter"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; The event was hosted by [[CNN]] anchor [[Rick Sanchez]] and featured appearances by prominent Twitter users [[MC Hammer]] and [[Gary Vaynerchuk]] and a video appearance by [[Shaquille O'Neal]].&lt;ref&gt;Vilensky, Mike: [http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2009/02/media.html/ "The Media Is Twittering Away Its Short Time on Earth"], ''New York'' Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capistrano, Daniela: [http://newsroom.mtv.com/2009/02/12/mc-hammer-afis-hunter-burgan-celebrate-twitter-mania-at-shorty-awards/ "MC Hammer, AFI's Hunter Burgan Celebrate Twitter Mania At Shorty Awards"], MTV News&lt;/ref&gt; The awards, in 26 categories, were voted on by Twitter users.&lt;ref name="Holmes2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turnquist, Kristi: [http://www.oregonlive.com/O/index.ssf/2009/08/portlands_carri_bugbee_plays_p.html/ "Portland's Carri Bugbee plays Peggy Olson of 'Mad Men' on Twitter"], ''The Oregonian''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Star routes''' is a term used in connection with the [[United States Post Office Department|United States postal service]] and the contracting of mail delivery services. The term is defunct as of 1970, but still is occasionally used to refer to ''Highway Contract Routes'' or HCRs which replaced the Star routes.&lt;ref name=npm&gt;[[National Postal Museum]]. ''[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/starroute/sr_02.html What is a Star Route?]''. Retrieved 2007-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Prior to 1845, transportation of inland [[mail]], other than by [[railroad]] or [[steamboat]], was given to bidders who offered stage or coach service.

This was abolished by act of Congress on March 3, 1845, which provided that the postmaster-general should lease all such contracts to the lowest bidder who tendered sufficient guarantee of faithful performance, without any conditions, except to provide for due celerity, certainty and security of transportation.  These bids became known as "celerity, certainty and security bids" and were designated on the route registers by three stars (***), thus becoming known as "star routes."&lt;ref name=npm/&gt;

==Star Route Frauds==
{{main|Star route scandal}}
The ''Star Route Frauds'' scandal involved a lucrative 19th century scheme whereby [[United States]] postal officials received bribes in exchange for awarding postal delivery contracts in southern and western areas.

An investigation into the Star Routes corruption took place under President [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881. Two previous congressional investigations into the Star Route frauds had occurred in 1872 and 1876 during the Grant Administration.  The 1872 investigation results had been tainted by bribery, while the 1876 investigation managed to shut down the Star Route frauds temporarily.  A resurgence of graft took place in 1878 in the Hayes Administration, continuing into the Garfield Administration.  Among the major players involved were some of the large contractors, the ex-US Representative [[Bradley Barlow]] of [[Vermont]], the Second Assistant Postmaster-General, some of the subordinates in the department, and [[Arkansas]] Senator [[Stephen W. Dorsey]], who became Secretary of the Republican National Committee during [[James A. Garfield]]'s 1880 presidential campaign. After Garfield's death by assassination, President [[Chester A. Arthur]] pursued the investigation.  A federal prosecution and trial took place in 1882, that was finally able to shut down the postal ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grossman|first=Mark|title=Political corruption in America: an encyclopedia of scandals, power, and greed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxupZ6O0p64C&amp;pg=PA308&amp;dq=A.J.+Creswell+Scandal&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=A.J.%20Creswell%20Scandal&amp;f=false|pages=308–309|year=2003|publisher=ABC-Clio|isbn=978-1-57607-060-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the fraudulent scheme was widespread, there were few convictions. Many of the defendants in the Star Routes trials were successfully defended by noted lawyer and orator, [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingersoll, Robert. ''[http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/star_route_trials/second_opening.html Opening remarks to the jury in the second Star Routes trial]'' December 21, 1882. Retrieved 2007-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Public disgust over the Star Routes graft served as an impetus for civil service reform and the passage of the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] in 1883.

==Post-abolition==
Star Routes, now known as Highway Contract Routes (or HCRs) as of 1970, have become a mode of delivering mail directly to customers. Historically, Highway Contract Routes were used rarely for mail delivery to households. An exception was in rural areas with less than one customer per mile.

In modern usage, HCRs can be used any place to deliver mail directly to customers. They are often used to deliver mail in growth areas such as new housing tracts. Some of these routes are being started in areas where there are as few as twenty deliveries per day.

Since 2000, the US Postal Service has added the term "Contract Delivery Service" (CDS) as their newest version of the Star Route. These routes are specifically set up to serve newly created urban communities. CDS carriers do not transport mail, and are being used in an attempt to find delivery drivers who will work for less than USPS carrier wages. As of 2007, several thousand of these CDS routes have been created, with plans for far more.

Many contractors are no longer individuals wanting to transport mail between post offices, or to deliver mail in a remote community where they live. This new concentration of more urban contract routes has made it practical for businesses to bid on multiple contracts, and then seek out workers who will carry those routes for less money than the US Postal Service pays on each contract. The US Postal Service is still attempting to find an equilibrium between the dependability of career postal carriers and the cost savings of contractors acting as a temp agency.

There is some debate as to how much control the Postal Service can exercise over these contract routes and have them remain contractors. Exactly where the line is that will mark the difference between an HCR being a contractor and an employee is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Akerman Senterfitt Attorneys.

'''The Competition Act, 2002''' was enacted by the [[Parliament of India]] and governs [[Indian competition law]]. It replaced the archaic [[The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969]]. Under this legislation, the [[Competition Commission of India]] was established to prevent the activities that have an adverse effect on competition in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1113485/|title = Sub-section 1 of Section 7 of Competition Act 2002|date = |accessdate = 3 November 2015|website = |publisher = Indian Kanoon|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = CCI will be in full operation next year|url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cci-will-be-in-full-operation-next-year/article1909354.ece|newspaper = The Hindu|date = 2007-09-11|access-date = 2015-11-19|issn = 0971-751X|language = en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act extends to whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir.

It is a tool to implement and enforce competition policy and to prevent and punish anti-competitive business practices by firms and unnecessary Government interference in the market. Competition laws is equally applicable on written as well as oral agreement, arrangements between the enterprises or persons.

The Competition Act, 2002 was amended by the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007 and again by the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2009.

The Act establishes a Commission which is duty bound to protect the interests of the free and fair competition (including the process of competition), and as a consequence, protect the interests of consumers. Broadly, the Commission's duty is:-
* To prohibit the agreements or practices that have or are likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in a market in India, (horizontal and vertical agreements / conduct);
* To prohibit the abuse of dominance in a market; 
* To prohibit acquisitions, mergers, amalgamations etc. between enterprises which have or are likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in market(s) in India. 

In addition to this, the Competition Act envisages its enforcement with the aid of mutual international support and enforcement network across the world,

==History==
The Government of India in April 1964 appointed the Monopolies Inquiry Commission under the Chairmanship of Justice K. C Das Gupta, a judge of the Supreme Court, to inquire into the extent and effect of concentration of economic power in private hands and prevalence of monopolistic and restrictive trade practices in important sectors of economic activity other than agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xX0Ff6p_f5QC|title=The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969|publisher=Georg Thieme Verlag }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To regulate advertising, in 1984, Parliament inserted a chapter on unfair trade practices in the '''Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/zAwaIsYu54i7oKNZ8aPV7J/New-law-statutory-body-imperative-to-foster-fair-trade-prac.html|title=New law, statutory body imperative to foster fair trade practices in India|last=Pathak|first=Akhileshwar|date=2016-04-18|work=[[Livemint]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission was constituted in the year 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8P2Vt2vz_cC|title=Restrictive Trade Practices and Public Interest|last=Singh|first=Ravi Karan|date=1989-01-01|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=9788170991724|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 had its genesis in the Directive Principles of State Policy embodied in the Constitution of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/annual_reports/annualreport2007/Eng/CHAPTER4.pdf|title=THE MONOPOLIES AND RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT, 1969 POLICY,PROVISIONS AND PERFORMANCE|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received the assent of the President of India on 27 December, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xX0Ff6p_f5QC|title=The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969|publisher=Georg Thieme Verlag }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act was intended to curb the rise of concentration of wealth in a few hands and of monopolistic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxJ_AgAAQBAJ|title=Legal Aspects of Business|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259026584 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was repealed on September 2009. The Act has been succeeded by The Competition Act, 2002.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

The Competition Bill, 2001 was introduced in [[Lok Sabha]] by [[Minister of Finance (India)|Finance Minister]] [[Arun Jaitley]] on 6 August 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Competition Bill introduced |url=http://www.thehindu.com/2001/08/07/stories/0207000q.htm |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=6 August 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Salient Features ==

=== Anti  Agreements ===

Enterprises, persons or associations of enterprises or persons, including cartels, shall not enter into agreements in respect of production, supply, distribution, storage, acquisition or control of goods or provision of services, which cause or are likely to cause an '''"appreciable adverse impact'''" on competition in India. Such agreements would consequently be considered void. Agreements which would be considered to have an appreciable adverse impact would be those agreements which-
* Directly or indirectly determine sale or purchase prices,
* Limit or control production, supply, markets, technical development, investment or provision of services,
* Share the market or source of production or provision of services by allocation of inter alia geographical area of market, nature of goods or number of customers or any other similar way,
* Directly or indirectly result in bid rigging or collusive bidding.

=== Types of agreement ===
A 'horizontal agreement' is an agreement for co-operation between two or more competing businesses operating at the same level in the market.
A vertical agreement is an agreement between firms at different levels of the supply chain. For instance, a manufacturer of consumer electronics might have a vertical agreement with a retailer according to which the latter would promote their products in return for lower prices.

=== Abuse of dominant position ===
There shall be an abuse of dominant position if an enterprise imposes directly or indirectly unfair or discriminatory conditions in purchase or sale of goods or services or restricts production or technical development or create hindrance in entry of new operators to the prejudice of consumers. The provisions relating to abuse of dominant position require determination of dominance in the relevant market.
Dominant position enables an entreprise to operate independently or effect competitors by action&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1113485/|title = Section 4 of Competition Act 2002|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Indian Kanoon|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combinations ===
The Act is designed to regulate the operation and activities of combinations, a term, which contemplates acquisition, mergers or amalgamations. Combination that exceeds the threshold limits specified in the Act in terms of assets or turnover, which causes or is likely to cause adverse impact on competition within the relevant market in India, can be scrutinized by the Commission.

=== Competition Commission of India ===
[[Competition Commission of India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About CCI {{!}} Competition Commission of India|url = http://www.cci.gov.in/about-cci|website = www.cci.gov.in|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a body corporate and independent entity possessing a common seal with the power to enter into contracts and to sue in its name. It is to consist of a chairperson, who is to be assisted by a minimum of two, and a maximum of six, other members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Organogram {{!}} Competition Commission of India|url = http://www.cci.gov.in/organogram|website = www.cci.gov.in|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = `CCI to act as nodal agency to check anti-competitive practices'|url = http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/tp-marketing/cci-to-act-as-nodal-agency-to-check-anticompetitive-practices/article2176935.ece|website = The Hindu Business Line|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the duty of the Commission to eliminate practices having adverse effect on competition, promote and sustain competition, protect the interests of consumers and ensure freedom of trade in the markets of India. The Commission is also required to give opinion on competition issues on a reference received from a statutory authority established under any law and to undertake competition advocacy, create public awareness and impart training on competition issues.

Commission has the power to inquire into unfair agreements or abuse of dominant position or combinations taking place outside India but having adverse effect on competition in India, if any of the circumstances exists:
* An agreement has been executed outside India
* Any contracting party resides outside India
* Any enterprise abusing dominant position is outside India
* A combination has been established outside India
* A party to a combination is located abroad.
* Any other matter or practice or action arising out of such agreement or dominant position or combination is outside India.
To deal with cross border issues, Commission is empowered to enter into any [[Memorandum of understanding|Memorandum of Understanding]] or arrangement with any foreign agency of any foreign country with the prior approval of Central Government.

=== Review of orders of Commission ===
Any person aggrieved by an order of the Commission can apply to the Commission for review of its order within thirty days from the date of the order. Commission may entertain a review application after the expiry of thirty days, if it is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from preferring the application in time. No order shall be modified or set aside without giving an opportunity of being heard to the person in whose favour the order is given and the Director General where he was a party to the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1113485/|title = Section 37 of Competition Act 2002|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Indian Kanoon|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appeal ===
Any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Commission may file an appeal to the Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of communication of the decision or order of the Commission. No appeal shall lie against any decision or order of the Commission made with the consent of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1113485/|title = Section 40 of Competition Act 2002|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Indian Kanoon|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Penalty ===
If any person fails to comply with the orders or directions of the Commission shall be punishable with fine which may extend to ₹ 1 lakh for each day during which such non compliance occurs, subject to a maximum of ₹ 10 crore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1113485/|title = Section 43 of Competition Act 2002|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Indian Kanoon|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If any person does not comply with the orders or directions issued, or fails to pay the fine imposed under this section, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which will extend to three years, or with fine which may extend to ₹ 25 crores or with both.

Section 44 provides that if any person, being a party to a combination makes a statement which is false in any material particular or knowing it to be false or omits to state any material particular knowing it to be material, such person shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than ₹ 50 lakhs but which may extend to ₹ 1 crore.

'''''The Harvest''''' ({{lang-es|La Cosecha}}) is a 2010 [[documentary film]] about [[Agriculture|agricultural]] [[child labour|child labor]] in [[United States|America]]. The film depicts children as young as 12 years of age who work as many as 12 hours a day, six months a year, subject to hazardous conditions: [[Hyperthermia|heat exposure]], [[pesticide]]s, and dangerous work.  The agriculture industry has been subject to significantly more lenient [[labour law|labor laws]] than any other occupation in the [[United States]].  As a result, lack of consistent schooling significantly limits their opportunities of succeeding in high school or more.  The hazardous conditions threaten their health and lives.  The purpose of the documentary is to bring awareness of the harsh working conditions which tens of thousands of children face in the fields of the United States each year and to enact the [[Children's Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act)|Children's Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act, HR 3564)]] which will bring parity of labor conditions to field workers that are afforded to minors in other occupations.

==Background==
The [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA) has different standards for children working in [[agriculture]] than in any other industry.  The Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs estimates that there are between 400,000 and 500,000 children working in the farming industry.  Children as young as 12 years of age work in the fields.  There is no minimum number of hours worked a day, aside from being outside school hours.  They are exposed to the sun, harmful [[pesticide]]s and hazardous conditions.  Children are in up to three times greater danger of exposure to pesticides than adults due to their size and stage of development.  The fatality rate is six times that in any other industry: children account for 20% of all deaths on farms.  Although agriculture is a hazardous occupation, no statistics are maintained on child laborers and serious accidents.&lt;ref name=AFOP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afop.org/children-in-the-fields/learn-the-facts/ |title=Learn the Facts |year=2011 |work=Children in the Fields |publisher=Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who work on farms or in fields spend on average 30 hours a week, even during times of the year when school is in session.  Of the children who work on farms, 50% of them will not graduate from high school.&lt;ref name=AFOP/&gt;  The [[United States Department of Labor]] estimates that children earn about $1,000 in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afop.org/about/2011-year-of-the-farmworker-child/ |title=2011 Year of the Farmworker Child |year=2011 |work=Children in the Fields |publisher=Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''The Harvest'' is a feature [[documentary film]] on the life of [[Migrant worker|migrant]] children and their families in the [[United States]].  It revisits [[Edward R. Murrow]]’s ''[[Harvest of Shame]]'', filmed 53 years ago, and reveals that little has changed over the past five decades in the lives of migrant farm workers in the United States. ''The Harvest'', however, is told from a child's perspective as it presents four of the more than 400,000 children between the ages of 5 and 16 who labor in fields and factories, lacking the protections offered by the Fair Labor Standards Act that all other American children enjoy.&lt;ref name="Shine Global Inc."&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shineglobal.org/?page_id=19 | title=The Harvest/La Cosecha, The Story of the Children Who Feed America | publisher=Shine Global | year=2010 | accessdate=2011-05-27 |archivedate=2011-01-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104234610/http://www.shineglobal.org/index.php/hero-of-the-week/harvest/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film profiles several children and their families as they work through the 2009 - 2010 harvest seasons, facing  risks of being separated, deported or death.  A twelve-year-old girl, Zulema L., works in a field of strawberries. One of her earliest memories is being taught by her mother to pick and clean strawberries.  Zulema struggles academically because of the family's seasonal movement. She has attended eight different schools in eight years. Not confident that she will make it to high school, she has no dreams about what her future could hold.  The documentary tracks other children with their own stories of living a life of a [[child labour|child laborer]].&lt;ref name="Shine Global Inc."/&gt;

Work began on the documentary in June 2007 and through the 2009 - 2010 harvests.  In that time the project has followed harvests in [[Minnesota]], [[North Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Ohio]]. The documentary was shot with cinematic scope. Post-production began in early winter 2010, with the completion of the film in fall 2010.&lt;ref name="Shine Global Inc."/&gt;

''The Harvest'' was produced by [[Shine Global]] in association with Globalvision, Romano Film and Photography, and [[Eva Longoria]]'s UnbeliEVAble Productions.  Longoria signed on as an executive producer of the project in 2009.&lt;ref name="broadcastingcable.com"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/189904-Eva_Longoria_Parker_to_Executive_Produce_Child_Farm_Worker_Documentary.php | title=Eva Longoria Parker to Executive Produce Child Farm Worker Documentary | author=Tanklefsky, D | date=Mar 13, 2009  | publisher=Bay Media, LLC | accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by [[Robin Romano|U.

==CARE legislation==
[[Eva Longoria]], director [[U. Roberto Romano]], and associate director Julia Perez visited [[Capitol Hill]] to mark the anniversary of [[Members of Congress|Representative]] [[Lucille Roybal-Allard|Lucille Roybal-Allard’s]] introduction of the CARE Act [[legislation]] in September 2009.  The [[Children's Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act)|Children’s Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act, HR 3564)]] addresses the harshest conditions that tens of thousands of children as young as 12 years of age may be subject to, such as restrictions in the number of hours that children work in a day.  The intention of the [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] is to raise the standard for children working in agriculture to that of any other occupation in the United States.  As of September 1, 2010 the bill had 103 [[Sponsor (legislative)|co-sponsors]].  While on Capitol Hill, Longoria and Romano showed scenes from the feature-length documentary to illustrate the harsh working conditions and exploitation of children in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://roybal-allard.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=206669 |title=Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, Press Release |date=Sep 15, 2010 |publisher=Offices of Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trailer of the film was first privately screened at a [[United States Department of Labor]] panel discussion, hosted by [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] [[Hilda Solis]] and including [[Dolores Huerta]] of the [[United Farm Workers]], filmmaker Robin Romano, Mark Lara from the Department of Labor's [[Wage and Hour Division]], and other experts.  During the presentation, details of Roybal-Allard's bill were outlined: a child must be a [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|minimum]] of 14 years of age to work in the fields, children under the age of 16 are restricted from working in the fields if it affects their health or school performance, and children under the age of 18 are restricted from hazardous work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/dol/media/webcast/20090916-harvest/index.htm |title=Department of Labor, Panel Discussion About Migrant Farm Worker Children |date=September 16, 2009 |work=Newsroom, Audio and Video, Better Work Program |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=2011-05-27 |postscript='  See the video of the DOL panel discussion for more information and a trailer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115140422/http://www.dol.gov/dol/media/webcast/20090916-harvest/index.htm |archivedate=January 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12 of 2014, the film's Associate Director, Julia Perez, spoke before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on behalf of farm worker rights and child labor in U.S. agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14940&amp;LangID=E|title=Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination discusses situation in United States with non-governmental organizations|publisher=United Nations|date=2014-08-12|accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN press release mentioned exposure to pesticides, wage theft, sexual assault, police harassment and other illegal working conditions faced by children &amp;mdash; largely Latino children who either were born in the United States or migrated with their families.

'''''Invisible Bankers: Everything the Insurance Industry Never Wanted You to Know''''' is a 1982 book on the insurance industry. It was written by the financial journalist [[Andrew Tobias]] who became famous for his earlier book ''[[The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need]]''. It covers the financial details of life, auto, health and fire [[insurance]]—the types consumers normally buy.

Because insurers are frequently the victims of [[insurance fraud]], insurance companies need to be on their guard. In addition, an unscrupulous insurer could, in theory, make more profits if it could either induce their insureds into settling for less than they are entitled to or from outright wrongly denying valid claims in hopes that a small yet significant percentage would either get discouraged or wrongly believe that their claims were invalid. This makes dealings with insurers difficult. This book was the first guide to ordinary consumers into both the math and the business side of insurance.

==Early life==
Cholmondeley was a great-grandson of [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere]] (1870–1931), a pioneering settler in Kenya who was the effective "founder" of the [[Whites in Kenya|White community]] in that country. Cholmondeley was the only son and heir of [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 5th Baron Delamere|The 5th Baron Delamere]] (b. 1934) and his wife Anne, ''née'' Renison.  His family is one of the large-scale [[landowner]]s in Kenya.&lt;ref name="bbcprofile"/&gt; He is also a descendant of [[Sir Robert Walpole]], the first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, Joseph. (1851). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mMjkTr5XU4cC&amp;pg=PA565&amp;dq=Delamere+and+Sir+Robert+Walpole&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA527,M1 ''The Book of Dignities,'' pp. 527], 565.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep school]] at Pembroke House, in the town of [[Gilgil]], Kenya, and [[Ashdown House, East Sussex|Ashdown House School]], in the village of [[Forest Row]] in [[East Sussex]], he was educated at [[Eton College]], from where he was expelled for bad behaviour.  After school he worked on various farms for his "pupil year", including time working on [[Kenneth Matiba]]'s farm, Wangu Embori.  He attended the [[Royal Agricultural College]], [[Cirencester]], 1987–1990, and then worked for the [[Agricultural Mortgage Corporation]] in Andover, [[Great Britain]].

==Career==
Back in Kenya from 1991 Cholmondeley started working for the family farming business and was then involved in many developing projects.  He decided against returning to Britain, and stayed to work in Kenya, where he was eventually made finance director of the Delamere beef and dairy farms.  ''The Daily Nation'' reported that the estate became a no-go area for trespassers and locals{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}.  By the 1990s he gained a reputation as an outstanding farmer, conscientious and diligent, he paid high attention to the quality of the land and soil while pursuing a traditional agenda for conservancy.  He established a game cropping enterprise on [[Soysambu|Soysambu Ranch]], the vast family estate in Kenya, which ran from 1992–2003, and which employed 15 people as well as building a modern [[abattoir]] and cold storage facilities.  He was also responsible for the design and layout of the Soysambu Wildlife Sanctuary and the building of Delamere's Camp in 1993, a high-class tourist lodge with a {{convert|6000|acre|km2|adj=on}} exclusive sanctuary covering the area around [[Lake Elmenteita]].

Cholmondeley was diligent in the employment of local labour; he employed hundreds of paid workers and voluntarily assisted others in many micro-projects.  He was promoted as director of [[Delamere Estates]] in 1994, and the following year the chairman of [[Nakuru Wildlife Conservancy]], a position he was elected to twice again.  In his attempts to keep poaching to a minimum he was appointed an honorary game warden.  In 1996 he introduced the first [[centre pivot irrigation]] into [[Naivasha]] and eventually the scheme covered over {{convert|600|acre|km2}} and provided employment for approximately 500 people.  In the same year he organised the reconstruction of the "Delamere Milk Shop" into a petrol station on the outskirts of Naivasha, the A104 highway. This is now a massive concern and Kenya's busiest [[farm shop]]. Of note is the constructed wetland to cope with the sewage resulting from over 3000 customers per day.

His energies turned to building the first straw bale building in [[Gilgil]], the location being on the edge of the [[Otutu forest]]. He created the leases and design criteria for two further tourist lodges, Mbweha Camp on the edge of [[Lake Nakuru National Park]], and [[Mawe Mbili]] lodge. This is part of the greater plan for the [[Soysambu Conservancy]], together with the establishment of two forestry partnerships covering {{convert|510|acre|km2}}.

While Cholmondeley was conscientious in his farm work, he was hedonistic in his free time - "wild women...rallying-car driving, motorcycling, paragliding".  He was 1986 Kenya Novice Motocross Champion.  In one episodic adventure he was confronted by a [[cape buffalo]] that seriously gored his leg, leaving a long gash and huge scar.  It was in hospital that he met Dr Sally Brewerton of [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]].  They married a year later in 1998, and had two sons.&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Telegraph'', Friday 19 August 2016, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shootings==
On 19 April 2005, Cholmondeley shot game ranger Samson ole Sisina, working undercover for the [[Kenya Wildlife Service]] on his ranch in [[Gilgil]] division, [[Nakuru District]].  He arrived at the slaughterhouse after his ranch employees had summoned his help during what seemed to be a robbery.  The accusation was that he shot the KWS employee who was dressed in plain clothes, but Cholmondeley insisted it was in [[self-defense]] as the ranger had shot at him first without warning.  However, a witness account says the victim was shot in the back.  The Attorney General [[Amos Wako]] discontinued the case by issuing a ''[[nolle prosequi]]''. This decision was widely criticised by Kenyan media and the public, with many claiming he walked free due to the influence of class and position.  There was a public outcry in Nairobi, and from Masai who wanted to occupy Delamere land.  Nick Maes, a ''Sunday Telegraph'' reporter, years later found a complex man challenged by changing Kenyan conditions, rising criminality in the countryside, and mounting criticism of white ownership in Kenya generally.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

On 10 May 2006, he was taken again into custody for the killing of Robert Njoya Mbugua, a Kikuyu tribesman, looking for food for his family, whom he had discovered on his land with three companions and a pack of dogs, carrying the caracass of an antelope they had killed on the estate.  Cholmondeley told police he had shot at the poachers' dogs, standard practice under [[Kenya Wildlife Service]] guidelines, killing two of them, and that he had not intended to shoot Njoya, whom he saw lying wounded in the hedgerow.  The dead man's companions disputed that version of events. What was undisputed was that Cholmondeley applied a tourniquet to the bleeding man and shouted for a car to take him to hospital, as well as calling the police.
   
Cholmondeley was held in detention - the only white man out of 3,600 inmates - at the [[Kamiti Maximum Security Prison]] after the incident and during the ongoing court proceedings in a tiny cell in the prison outside Nairobi, "like living inside a greasy saucepan infested with rats and cockroaches."&lt;ref name="Express-Happy valley"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/701648/Tom-Cholmondeley-African-Aristocrat-jail-happy-valley-curse | title=Tom Cholmondeley: The African Aristocrat who went to jail | work=Daily Express | date=18 August 2016 | accessdate=22 August 2016 | author=Blackburn, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cholmondeley was divorced but a girlfriend, jeweller [[Sally Dudmesh]], visited him in prison every week.

The trial began 25 September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=50365 "Cholmondeley murder trial kicks off,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513005537/http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=50365 |date=13 May 2009 }} Kenya Broadcasting Corporation. 27 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  An interlocutory appeal on a question of procedural law was decided on 13 June 2008. He won an appeal to uphold his right to a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;Pflanz, Mike. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/3167017/Kenyan-murder-charge-aristocrat--Thomas-Cholmondeley-denied-fair-trial.html "Kenyan murder charge aristocrat Thomas Cholmondeley 'denied fair trial',"] ''The Telegraph'' (London). 9 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, lay assessors in his trial found him not guilty.&lt;ref name="times-accquital-2009"&gt;McConnell, Tristan. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article5854041.ece "Lay Assessors find Thomas Cholmondeley Not Guilty of Murder,"] ''The Times'' (London). May 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 May 2009, Judge Muga Apondi, sitting as a single judge and not bound by the lay assessors' verdict, acquitted Cholmondeley of murder but found him guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter.&lt;ref name="bbc2" /&gt;

The verdict of April 2009 was largely based on the evidence by rally driver [[Carl Tundo]], who had accompanied his friend Cholmondeley to the scene. On 14 May 2009 Cholmondeley was sentenced to serve a further eight months in prison.  Apondi said he was imposing a "light" sentence given that he had been imprisoned for three years already, and had tried to help Njoya with first aid and transport to hospital.&lt;ref name="reuters-apondi-8mth-sentence"&gt;Elkington, Natasha and Humphrey Malalo. [https://www.reuters.com/article/africaCrisis/idUSLE892317 "Kenya aristocrat jailed for 8 months over killing,"] Reuters. 7 May 2009,&lt;/ref&gt; Cholmondeley was released early for good behaviour in October 2009 after serving five months of his eight-month prison sentence.&lt;ref name="bbc-2009-10-23" /&gt;

In an interview he expressed his opinions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{cquote|I've been portrayed as this great monster who goes round shooting black men for sport when my whole life I've striven to move away from racist behaviour ....The problem is I'm a very easy target.  I'm a white man, toffee nosed, titled and, on top of that, a white man in Africa...you know these are really bad things.}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Telegraph'', Friday 19 August 2016, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
While murder carries a mandatory death sentence, manslaughter has a statutory maximum of life imprisonment but with no mandatory minimum sentence under Kenyan law.&lt;ref&gt;Kadida, Jillo. [http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/595144/-/u67mfm/-/index.html "Guilty, but spared hangman's noose,"] ''Daily Nation'' (Nairobi). 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BBC Four]]'s ''[[Storyville (television series)|Storyville]]'' series featured the  Cholmondeley trial in an episode titled "Last White Man Standing".&lt;ref name="BBC last white man"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qjnjn | title=Storyville, 2009-2010, Last White Man Standing | work=BBC Four | accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1997, Cholmondeley was gored by a [[african buffalo|buffalo]] while walking to a launching site for [[paragliding]] in the [[Masai Mara]].

He married on 16 May 1998, Sally A. Brewerton. They had two sons but later divorced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p6841.htm#i68401 thepeerage, Lord Delamere retrieved 19 August 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

He had been a keen motor sportsman and was Kenya Novice [[Motocross]] champion in 1986 and runner-up in the Kenya [[Enduro]] championship in 2000. In addition he held a private pilot's licence [[Private pilot licence|PPL]] since 2000 and flew in Kenya, Britain, France, Germany, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique.

Cholmondeley died of [[cardiac arrest]] on Wednesday 17 August 2016 while undergoing [[hip surgery]] at MP Shah Hospital Nairobi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/08/17/aristocrat-tom-cholmondeley-dies-aged-48_c1405336|title=Aristocrat Tom Cholmondeley dies aged 48|last=|first=|date=August 17, 2016|website=The Star|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is survived by his sons, Hugh (b. 1998) (now heir apparent of the Delamere barony) and Henry (b. 2000).

'''Tomás Godoy Cruz''' (May 6, 1791 &amp;ndash; May 15, 1852) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] statesman and businessman. He was a representative to the [[Congress of Tucumán]] which on July 9, 1816 [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declared the Independence of Argentina]].

Godoy Cruz was born in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. He studied in Mendoza, then in [[Chile]] at the [[Universidad de Chile (university)|Royal University of San Felipe]], graduating in philosophy, canonical and civil law. He lived in Chile until 1814, and served in the [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] [[Cabildo (council)]] during the last year of his stay. He then returned to Mendoza, setting up a [[gunpowder]] factory. He agitated to make General [[José de San Martín]] governor of [[Province of Cuyo|Cuyo]], and helped finance the [[Army of the Andes]].

In 1815, at just 24 years old, Godoy Cruz was elected by Mendoza to the [[Tucumán Congress]] and served in 1816 for the declaration. He was president on two occasions and vice-president on one.
He subsequently served as governor of [[Mendoza Province]] 1820-22. In 1831 he was exiled to Chile where he was a teacher and pioneered [[silkworm]] cultivation. He was also a successful merchant of woven goods.

The city of [[Godoy Cruz, Mendoza|Godoy Cruz]] and its surrounding department in Mendoza, and streets across the country were named in his honour.

'''Trushar Khetia''', is a [[Kenya]]n businessman and entrepreneur. He is the founder and current Chairman and CEO of the Tria Group of companies, including a chain of supermarkets known as [[Society Stores Supermarkets]].&lt;ref name="Two8"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=3 March 2016|date=10 March 2015|  url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2015/03/10/the-28-year-old-kenyan-entrepreneur-who-built-a-7-million-retail-and-advertising-business/#106791874c66|title=The 28 Year-Old Kenyan Entrepreneur Who Built A $7 Million Retail And Advertising Business|publisher=[[Forbes.com]]| first=Mfonobong|last=Nsehe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
He was born on 29 November 1986 in [[Kitale]], in the [[Trans-Nzoia County]] of Kenya. The family owned a retail shop which has since morphed into ''Khetia Supermarkets''.&lt;ref name="How"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=3 March 2016|

At age 17, in 2004, he was admitted to [[Manchester Business School]], graduating in 2007, with the degree of [[Bachelor of Business Management]], specializing in marketing.&lt;ref name="Two8"/&gt;
 
==Career==
Following graduation from university, he found employment in the [[United Kingdom]], as a business development manager at [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G), working there for 3 years until 2010. In June 2011, he returned to Kenya and worked in the family business in Kitale for one year. Following disagreements with some family members regarding business direction, he decided to relocate to Nairobi and strike out on his own. In 2013, he started [http://tria.co.ke/ Tria Group], a business that specializes in advertising on transit media like buses and airplanes. He started the business in Kenya and in 2014 he opened up a similar business in Tanzania.&lt;ref name="Two8"/&gt;

In November 2014, using his savings from the P&amp;G days, profits from his transit media businesses and loans from family and friends, Trushar Khetia acquired an operating supermarket in Thika, inclusive of stock. He closed the store down for ten days while re-branding and then opened his first Society Stores supermarket.&lt;ref name="Two8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markmaish.com/2014/10/28/how-i-made-7-million-in-7-days/|

'''John Vigor Brown''' (18 June 1854 – 2 September 1942), known as '''Vigor Brown''',&lt;ref name=NCC&gt;{{cite web|title=History |url=http://www.napier.govt.nz/index.php?pid=841 |publisher=Napier City Council |accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a New Zealand [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Napier (New Zealand electorate)|Napier]], in the [[North Island]]. He was [[Mayor of Napier, New Zealand|Mayor of Napier]] for a total of 18 years. He was a well-known figure in his adopted city, a successful businessman, and involved in many clubs and organisations.

==Early life==
Brown was born in [[London]] in 1854. For his parents, Jessie Gilmour and John Brown, it was their third boy and last child.&lt;ref name="Marriage"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marriage |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=HBH18801203.2.8 |accessdate=10 December 2010 |newspaper=Hawke's Bay Herald |volume=XXI |issue=5845 |date=3 December 1880 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents had Scottish ancestry. His father worked for a bank, and was later a commercial traveller. The family briefly lived in France before emigrating to [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. John Vigor Brown, his brothers and their mother arrived in [[Melbourne]] on 22 January 1862 on the ''Water Nymph''. It is assumed that his father was already there. They made their home in [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]]. He was educated at [[Melbourne Grammar School|Melbourne Church of England Grammar School]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Brown"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3b53/1 | title= Brown, John Vigor - Biography | last= Axford | first= C.

==Professional career==
Brown learned the trade of a wholesale merchant (clothing) at the firm Sargood, King and Sargood in Melbourne.

The [[Napier (New Zealand electorate)|Napier]] electorate had been held since the [[New Zealand general election, 1899|1899 election]] by [[Alfred Fraser]]. Fraser stood again in the [[New Zealand general election, 1908|1908 election]], but although he was with the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], Brown also contested the electorate as a Liberal.&lt;ref name="1908 nomination"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hawkes Bay|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19081102.2.6.2 |accessdate=10 December 2010 |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |volume=LXXVI |issue=107 |date=2 November 1908 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown won the contest with a majority of 1035 votes (3803 votes to 2768).&lt;ref name="1908 final result"&gt;{{cite news|title=Napier Seat |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19081123.2.65 |accessdate=10 December 2010 |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |volume=LXXVI |issue=123 |date=23 November 1908 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1911 results" /&gt;

In the [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911 election]], Brown was challenged by [[Henry Hill (educationalist)|Henry Hill]]. Both men were supporters of the current Liberal government. Brown and Hill received 3858 and 2825 votes, respectively.&lt;ref name="1911 results"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hawke's Bay Province |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=OSWCC19111212.2.58.13 |accessdate=11 December 2010 |newspaper=Otautau Standard and Wallace County Chronicle |volume=VII |issue=344 |date=12 December 1911 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Election Campaign |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19111121.2.22 |accessdate=11 December 2010 |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |volume=LXXXII |issue=123 |date=21 November 1911 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown successfully contested the {{NZ election link|1919}} for the Liberal Party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Napier Seat|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=WDT19191122.2.31.3|accessdate=18 December 2014|work=[[Wairarapa Daily Times]]|volume=45|issue=13985|date=22 November 1919|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the party's leader, [[Joseph Ward]], failed to win re-election in the {{NZ electorate link|Awarua}} electorate. When [[Thomas Wilford]] became leader later in 1920, Brown objected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leader of the Liberals|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19201008.2.92|accessdate=18 December 2014|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|volume=LVII|issue=17596|date=8 October 1920|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transferred his allegiance to the [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]].&lt;ref name="1922 Reform"&gt;{{cite news|title=General Elections|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19221017.2.32|accessdate=18 December 2014|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|volume=LIX|issue=18223|date=17 October 1922|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[William Massey]] had given Brown the official party endorsement, despite the local Reform committee having already chosen [[John Mason (New Zealand politician)|John Mason]] as their candidate. Neither was victorious and the seat was won by [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour's]] [[Lewis McIlvride]].{{sfn|Campbell|1975|p=110}}

In {{NZ election link year|1925}}, Brown failed to receive Reform nomination with new party organizer [[Albert Davy]] ensuring it went to Mason.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Gardner | first= W.J. | date= September 1961 | title= W.F. Massey in Power | journal= Political Science | volume= 13 | issue= 2 | page= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later stood unsuccessfully as an independent in {{NZ election link year|1931}}.

==Family==
Brown married Caroline Balaclava Cook, daughter of the late John Cook of [[Auckland]], on 27 November 1880 at St John's Church in Napier.&lt;ref name=Marriage /&gt; They had four daughters and two sons before Caroline died from [[peritonitis]] on 6 September 1891 at the young age of 36. He remarried on 19 September 1894 to Violet McConechie Bogle. There were no further children from this second marriage.&lt;ref name="DNZB Brown" /&gt;

In 1910, Brown had a 31' launch built for the family, named ''Water Nymph'' after the ship used for his emigration to Victoria during his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parade of Classic &amp; Wooden Boats  Lake Rotoiti  North Island, New Zealand|url=http://www.woodenboatparade.co.nz/pre1920.htm |publisher=Lake Rotoiti Classic and Wooden Boat Association|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second wife predeceased him on 23 February 1924. Brown died on 2 September 1942 in Napier, where he had lived since 1877. After his death, his family took on the surname Vigor-Brown.&lt;ref name="DNZB Brown" /&gt;

'''WCAT''' (1390 [[Hertz|kHz]]) is a [[commercial radio|commercial]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[radio station]] [[City of license|licensed]] to [[Burlington, Vermont]], United States, and serving the [[Burlington, Vermont metropolitan area|Burlington-Plattsburgh area]].  The station is owned by Radio Broadcasting Services, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=WCAT |title=WCAT Facility Record |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to FCC records, WCAT's tower #1 is the tallest man-made structure in the state of [[Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fccinfo.com/CMDProASRLookup.php?tabSearchType=ASR+Search&amp;sASR=1042292|title=FCCInfo Structure Registration Results|first=Cavell, Mertz &amp; Associates,|last=Inc.|website=www.fccinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WCAT broadcasts at 5,000 [[watt]]s around the clock, with a non-directional signal by day.  But to protect other stations on [[AM 1390]] at night when AM radio waves travel farther, it uses a [[directional antenna]] after sunset.  WCAT's [[transmitter]] is located off Intervale Road in Burlington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio-locator.com/info/WCAT-AM|title=WCAT-AM 1390 kHz - Burlington, VT|website=radio-locator.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studios and offices are on Water Tower Circle in [[Colchester, Vermont]].

WCAT also airs on an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[Broadcast relay station|translator]], '''W252CJ''', at 98.3 [[Hertz|MHz]], to give listeners the option to hear the station in FM stereo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio-locator.com/info/W252CJ-FX|title=W252CJ-FM 98.3 MHz - Burlington, VT|website=radio-locator.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The station first [[Sign-on|signed on]] as '''WDOT''' on April 19, 1954 on the [[AM 1400]] frequency at 1,000 watts of power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable|Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-216]]&lt;/ref&gt; WDOT was Burlington's [[top-40]] radio station for years and also an [[Network affiliate|affiliate]] of the [[ABC News Radio|ABC Contemporary Radio Network]]. The station later moved to its current frequency,  [[AM 1390]], and was allowed to broadcast with 5,000 watts of power both daytme and nighttime. The station uses a three-tower directional antenna at night to protect 1390 co-channels in [[Syracuse, New York]] ([[WFBL]]), [[Presque Isle, Maine]] ([[WEGP]]), and [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]] ([[WPLM (AM)|WPLM]]).

[[Image:WCAT1390logo.jpg|thumb|left|WCAT's previous logo as an ESPN Radio affiliate]]
The station changed its [[call sign]] to '''WKDR''' on June 1, 1993. The WKDR calls originated on the AM 1070 frequency, licensed to [[Plattsburgh, New York]] (which now operates as [[WPLB (AM)|WPLB]]), and the move benefited WKDR, since its previous position operates only in the daytime, protecting the former 50,000-watt clear channel (1-B) station, [[CBA (AM)|CBA]] in [[Moncton, New Brunswick]].

The station changed its call letters to '''WVAA''' on September 24, 2002, and to the current '''WCAT''' on August 21, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=73613&amp;Callsign=WCAT |title=WCAT Call Sign History |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}&lt;/ref&gt;

WCAT, as a [[sports radio]] station, switched affiliations from [[ESPN Radio]] to [[Fox Sports Radio]] on January 1, 2011; the ESPN affiliation has moved to 101.3 [[WCPV]].&lt;ref name="bfp-wcatfox"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Donoghue |newspaper=[[Burlington Free Press]] |title=Fox Sports joins Champlain Valley radio market |url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20101221/NEWS01/12210301/Fox-Sports-joins-Champlain-Valley-radio-market |date=December 21, 2010 |accessdate=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through much of 2011, WCAT broadcast a sports talk format in [[simulcast]] with [[sister station]]s [[WRSA (AM)|WRSA]] (1420 AM) and [[WFAD]] (1490 AM) as "Fox Sports Vermont." By the end of the year, it had switched to an [[oldies]] music format simulcast with [[WIFY]] as "Cruisin' 93.7".

On September 1, 2014 WCAT (with sister station WRSA) dropped the simulcast with WIFY and switched to a [[comedy radio]] format. The two stations switched back to oldies in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/community/topic/oldies-back-on-1390-burlington-1420-st-albans/|title=Oldies back on 1390 Burlington &amp; 1420 St. Albans|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early January 2017 WCAT and WRSA both went [[dark (broadcasting)|dark]].  The oldies format relocated to 1070 WPLB, which several months earlier had been sold by WCAT owner Northeast Broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/110312/mid-century-radio-moves-across-lake-champlain/ Mid Century Moves Across Lake Champlain] Radioinsight - January 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 9, 2017, WCAT returned to the air, launching a business news format.

'''Washington Boulevard Historic District''' is a multi-block area of [[downtown Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. It consists of structures facing Washington Boulevard between State and Clifford Streets. In 1982, it was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. It includes the [[Westin Book-Cadillac Hotel|Book-Cadillac Hotel]], the [[Book Tower]], the [[Industrial Building (Detroit)|Industrial Building]], and [[Detroit City Apartments]] among other architecturally significant buildings. Washington Boulevard is one of the city's main boulevards and part of [[Augustus Woodward]]'s 1807-design for the city. Because Woodward's plan was never completed, the boulevard contains a sharp curve south of Michigan Avenue where it was connected to an existing street.&lt;ref name = "dhs"&gt;{{citation | title = Washington Boulevard Historic District | publisher = Detroit Historical Society | url = http://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/washington-boulevard-historic-district}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The street was broadened and ornamented in the early part of the 20th century. The development was inspired by the [[City Beautiful]] movement and financed by [[J. Burgess Book Jr.]] and designed by [[Louis Kamper]]. It was to resemble New York's [[Fifth Avenue]] and European boulevards. A sculpture lined park between two one-way streets decorated a shopping district and upscale residential neighborhood [[Edward H. Bennett]], a well known master planner, turned Washington Boulevard into a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] streetscape.&lt;ref name = "det1701"&gt;{{citation | title = Washington Boulevard Historic District | publisher = Detroit1701 | url = http://detroit1701.org/WashingtonBlvd_Hist.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, Washington Boulevard was redesigned with an urban pedestrian mall that included new sculptures and an amphitheater. It has since been restored to its original plan.

'''Éditions Gallimard''' ({{IPA-fr|edisjɔ̃ ɡalimaːʁ|lang}}) is one of the leading French book [[publisher]]s. ''[[The Guardian]]'' has described it as having "the best [[backlist]] in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Paul, [http://books.guardian.co.uk/internationalwriting/story/0,6194,348130,00.html "The French Connection"]; ''[[The Guardian]]'', July 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 it and its subsidiaries published 1,418 titles.

Founded by [[Gaston Gallimard]] in 1911, the publisher is now majority-owned by his grandson [[Antoine Gallimard (publisher)|Antoine Gallimard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dictionnaire encyclopédique du Livre en deux volumes | publisher=Éditions du Cercle de la Libraire | author=Pascal Fouché | p=251 | year=2005 | isbn=2-7654-0911-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The publisher was founded on 31 May 1911 in Paris by [[Gaston Gallimard]], [[André Gide]], and [[Jean Schlumberger]] as ''Les Éditions de la [[Nouvelle Revue Française]]'' (NRF).

From its 31 May 1911 founding until June 1919, Nouvelle Revue Française published one hundred titles including ''La Jeune Parque'' by [[Paul Valéry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henri Vignes|author2=Pierre Boudrot|title=Bibliographie des éditions de la Nouvelle Revue française : 26 mai 1911-15 juillet 1919|publisher=Libraire H. Vignes|location=Paris|year=2011|isbn=9782867421822}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michel Jarrety|title=Paul Valéry|isbn=9782010178894|publisher=Hachette supérieur|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; NRF published the second volume of [[In Search of Lost Time]], In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower, which became the first [[Prix Goncourt]]-awarded book published by the company.&lt;ref name="gallimardhist"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Les Échos (newspaper)|title=Gallimard, une histoire si française|date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nouvelle Revue Française adopted the name "Librairie Gallimard" in 1919.

During the [[occupation of France in World War II]], Gaston Gallimard was hosted in [[Carcassonne]] by poet [[Joë Bousquet]]. He returned to [[Paris]] on October 1940 to enter discussions with the Nazi German authorities, who wished to control his publishing company. It was agreed that Gaston Gallimard would still control his company if he collaborated with the authorities and published pro-Nazi writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L'édition française sous l'Occupation : 1940-1944|author={{ill|Pascal Fouché|fr}}|year=1987|publisher=Bibliothèque de littérature française contemporaine de l'Université Paris|oclc=17851738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catalogue ==
Éditions Gallimard's best-selling authors include [[Albert Camus]] (29 million copies), [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]] (26.3 million copies), and [[J.K. Rowling]] (whose ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series sold 26 million copies).&lt;ref name="gallimardhist"/&gt; Other important authors include [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Roald Dahl]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Philip Roth]], [[George Orwell]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Pablo Neruda]], and [[John Steinbeck]].

As of 2011, its catalog consists of 36 [[Prix Goncourt]] winners, 38 writers who have received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], and ten writers who have been awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]].&lt;ref name="gallimardhist"/&gt; In 2010 the company had a turnover of {{€|230|link=yes}} million,&lt;ref name="gallimardhist"/&gt; and over 1,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{ill|Livres hebdo|fr}}, 14 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallimard acquired [[Groupe Flammarion]] from [[RCS MediaGroup]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebookseller.com/news/flammarion-sold-gallimard.html Flammarion sold to Gallimard]. The Book Seller. Retrieved 1 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
