      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16114">'''Adaptationism''' is the [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] view that many physical and psychological traits of organisms are evolved [[adaptations]]. '''Pan-adaptationism''' is the strong form of this, deriving from the early 20th century [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], that all traits are adaptations, a view now shared by few biologists.&lt;ref name=Koonin2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koonin |first1=Eugene V. |title=The Origin at 150: is a new evolutionary synthesis in sight? |journal=Trends in Genetics |date=November 2009 |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=473–475 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.09.007 |pmid=2784144 |pmc=2784144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptationists perform research to try to distinguish adaptations (e.g., the umbilical cord) from byproducts (e.g., the belly button) or random variation (e.g., convex or concave shape of the belly button).  [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George Williams]]' ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966) was highly influential in its development, defining some of the [[heuristics]] used to identify adaptations.

==Criteria to identify a trait as an adaptation==

Adaptationism is an approach to studying the evolution of form and function. It attempts to frame the existence and persistence of traits, assuming that each of them arose independently and improved the reproductive success of the organism's ancestors. 
A trait is an [[adaptation]] if it fulfils the following criteria:&lt;!--necessary but not sufficient--&gt;

# The trait is a variation of an earlier form.
# The trait is heritable through the transmission of genes.
# The trait enhances reproductive success.

==Constraints on the power of evolution==
===Genetic constraints===

Genetic reality provides constraints on the power of random mutation followed by natural selection.

With [[pleiotropy]], some genes control multiple traits, so that adaptation of one trait is impeded by effects on other traits that are not necessarily adaptive. Selection that influences [[epistasis]] is a case where the regulation or expression of one gene, depends on one or several others. This is true for a good number of genes though to differing extents. The reason why this leads to muddied responses is that selection for a trait that is epistatically based can mean that an [[allele]] for a gene that is epistatic when selected would happen to affect others. This leads to the coregulation of others for a reason other than there is an adaptive quality to each of those traits. Like with pleiotropy, traits could reach fixation in a population as a by-product of selection for another.

In the context of development the difference between pleiotropy and epistasis is not so clear but at the genetic level the distinction is more clear. With these traits as being by-products of others it can ultimately be said that these traits evolved but not that they necessarily represent adaptations.

[[Polygenic]] traits are controlled by a number of separate genes. Many traits are polygenic, for example human height. To drastically change a polygenic trait is likely to require multiple changes.

===Anatomical constraints===

Anatomical constraints are features of organism's [[anatomy]] that are prevented from change by being constrained in some way. When organisms diverge from a common ancestor and inherit certain characteristics which become modified by natural selection of mutant phenotypes, it is as if some are traits are locked in place and are unable to change in certain ways. Some textbook [[anatomical constraints]] often include examples of structures that connect parts of the body together though a physical link.

These links are hard if not impossible to break because evolution usually requires that anatomy be formed by small consecutive modifications in populations through generations. In his book, ''Why We Get Sick'', [[Randolph Nesse]] uses the [[Blind spot (vision)|"blind spot"]] in the vertebrate eye (caused by the nerve fibers running through the [[retina]]) as an example of this. He argues that [[natural selection]] has come up with an elaborate work-around of the eyes wobbling back-and-forth to correct for this, but vertebrates have not found the solution embodied in [[cephalopod]] eyes, where the optic nerve does not interrupt the view. See also: [[Evolution of the eye]].

Another example is the [[cranial nerves]] in [[tetrapods]]. In early vertebrate evolution, sharks, skates, and rays (collectively [[Chondrichthyes]]), the cranial nerves run from the part of the brain that interprets sensory information, and radiate out towards the organs that produce those sensations. In tetrapods, however, and [[mammals]] in particular, the [[nerves]] take an elaborate winding path through the [[cranium]] around structures that evolved after the common ancestor with sharks.

==Debate with structuralism==
{{further|Structuralism|Alternatives to evolution by natural selection}}

Adaptationism is sometimes characterized by critics as an unsubstantiated assumption that all or most traits are [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal]] adaptations. [[Structuralism (biology)|Structuralist]] critics (most notably [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in their [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] paper&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard C. Lewontin]]. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1979.0086 "The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme"] ''Proc. Roy. Soc. London B'' '''205''' ([http://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/GouldLewontin.pdf 1979]) pp. 581–598&lt;/ref&gt;) contend that the adaptationists have over-emphasized the power of [[natural selection]] to shape individual traits to an [[evolution]]ary optimum. Adaptationists are sometimes accused by their critics of using ''[[ad hoc]]'' [[Just-so story|"just-so stories"]]. The critics, in turn, have been accused of misrepresentation ([[Straw man]] argumentation), rather than attacking the actual statements of supposed adaptationists.

Adaptationist researchers respond by asserting that they, too, follow [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George Williams]]' depiction of adaptation as an "onerous concept" that should only be applied in light of strong evidence. This evidence can be generally characterized as the successful prediction of novel phenomena based on the hypothesis that design details of adaptations should fit a complex evolved design to respond to a specific set of selection pressures. In evolutionary psychology, researchers such as [[Leda Cosmides]], [[John Tooby]], and [[David Buss]] contend that the bulk of research findings that were uniquely predicted through adaptationist hypothesizing comprise evidence of the methods' validity.

==Purpose and function==
There are philosophical issues with the way biologists speak of function, effectively invoking teleology, the purpose of an adaptation.

===Function===
{{Main|Function (biology)}}

To say something has a function is to say something about what it does for the organism. It also says something about its history: how it has come about. A [[heart]] pumps blood: that is its function. It also emits sound, which is considered to be an ancillary side-effect, not its function. The heart has a history (which may be well or poorly understood), and that history is about how natural selection formed and maintained the heart as a pump. Every aspect of an organism that has a function has a history. Now, an adaptation must have a functional history: therefore we expect it must have undergone selection caused by relative survival in its habitat. It would be quite wrong to use the word adaptation about a trait which arose as a by-product.&lt;ref name="Sober1"&gt;{{harvnb|Sober|1993|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1966|pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely regarded as unprofessional for a biologist to say something like "A wing is for flying," although that is their normal function. A biologist would be conscious that sometime in the remote past feathers on a small dinosaur had the function of retaining heat, and that later many wings were not used for flying (e.g. penguins, [[ostrich]]es). So, the biologist would rather say that the wings on a bird or an insect usually had the function of aiding flight. That would carry the connotation of being an adaptation with a history of evolution by natural selection.

===Teleology ===
{{Main|Teleology in biology}}

[[Teleology]] was introduced into biology by Aristotle to describe the adaptedness of organisms. Biologists have found the implications of purposefulness awkward as they suggest supernatural intention, an aspect of [[Plato]]'s thinking which Aristotle rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nagel |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Nagel |date=May 1977 |title=Goal-Directed Processes in Biology |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |location=New York |publisher=The Journal of Philosophy, Inc. |volume=74 |issue=5 |pages=261–279 |doi=10.2307/2025745 |jstor=2025745 |issn=0022-362X}} Teleology Revisisted: The Dewy Lectures 1977 (first lecture)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nagel |first=Ernest |date=May 1977 |title=Functional Explanations in Biology |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=74 |issue=5 |pages=280–301 |doi=10.2307/2025746 |jstor=2025746 |issn=0022-362X}} Teleology Revisisted: The Dewy Lectures 1977 (second lecture)&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar term, [[teleonomy]], was suggested by [[Colin Pittendrigh]] in 1958;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pittendrigh|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; it grew out of [[cybernetics]] and [[Self-organization|self-organising systems]]. Biologists of the 1960s such as [[Ernst Mayr]], [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] and [[Jacques Monod]] used it as a less loaded alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1965|pp=33–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1988|loc=chpt. 3, "The Multiple Meanings of Teleological"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1966|loc="The Scientific Study of Adaptation"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Monod|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Allaby |editor-first=Michael |editor-link=Michael Allaby |encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Zoology |title=teleonomy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_UO957htTwC&amp;pg=PA530&amp;lpg=PA530 |accessdate=2015-08-24 |edition=Reissued with new cover and corrections |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |series=Oxford Paperback Reference |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=0-19-860758-X |lccn=2003278285 |oclc=444678726}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the discomfort remains. On the one hand, adaptation is obviously purposeful: natural selection chooses what works and eliminates what does not. On the other hand, biologists want to deny conscious purpose in evolution. The dilemma gave rise to a famous joke by the evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane|Haldane]]: "Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he's unwilling to be seen with her in public.'" [[David Hull]] commented that Haldane's mistress "has become a lawfully wedded wife. Biologists no longer feel obligated to apologize for their use of teleological language; they flaunt it. The only concession which they make to its disreputable past is to rename it 'teleonomy'."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hull|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5104">'''Alan Mittleman''' (born 1953) is a professor of [[Jewish philosophy]] at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]].

==Education==

Mittleman received his BA from [[Brandeis University]] and his MA and PhD from [[Temple University]].

==Career==

From 1984 to 1988, Mittleman served on the staff of the [[American Jewish Committee]].  He helped to draft a resolution by the [[United Church of Christ]] which made it the first [[Protestant]] denomination in the [[United States]] to declare that [[Christianity]] did not supersede [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Christianity didn't rescind Judaism, church says", ''Lawrence Journal-World'', Jul 1, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Mittleman went on to serve as a professor of Religion at [[Muhlenberg College]] from 1988 to 2004.  He was the head of the Muhlenberg College Religion Department from 1997-2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isreligion.org/wp-content/uploads/mittleman_vitae2.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726195440/http://www.isreligion.org/wp-content/uploads/mittleman_vitae2.pdf |date=2011-07-26 }} Accessed 11-10-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 until 2004, he was also the director of a major research project on "Jews and the American Public Square" initiated by the Pew Charitable Trusts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jtsa.edu/x1331.xml?ID_NUM=108287, accessed 12-15-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Mittleman became Professor of Jewish Philosophy at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTS).  In 2007, he served as Visiting Professor of Religion at [[Princeton University]], and in that same year he became Chair of the Department of Jewish Thought at JTS.

Upon joining the Jewish Theological Seminary faculty, he also became director of the JTS's Louis Finkelstein Institute for Religious and Social Studies, a position he held until 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jtsa.edu/News/Press_Releases/LFI_Anouncement.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204005154/http://www.jtsa.edu/News/Press_Releases/LFI_Anouncement.xml |archivedate=2014-02-04 }} - AUGUST 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, he became director of the Tikvah Institute for Jewish Thought at the Jewish Theological Seminary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jtsa.edu/Scholars_and_Research/Tikvah_Institute.xml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124094648/http://jtsa.edu/Scholars_and_Research/Tikvah_Institute.xml |archive-date=2010-11-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical views==

Mittleman has described himself as being a "rationalist" in his religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jtsa.edu/x12578.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313185226/http://www.jtsa.edu/x12578.xml |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}, accessed 12-15-2010&lt;/ref&gt; He may be placed within the [[Jewish philosophy#Jewish rationalism|Jewish rationalist]] tradition of Jewish philosophy.

He thinks that "pure secularism may be incoherent" but that "robust religious hope needs the secularist critique."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jtsa.edu/x12578.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313185226/http://www.jtsa.edu/x12578.xml |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}, accessed 12-15-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==

Professor Mittleman is married to Patti Mittleman, the retired Director of Muhlenberg College Hillel. They reside in Pennsylvania and have two sons.

==Publications==

Mittleman's books include:

'''Arthur Fine''' (born 1937) is an [[United States|American]] [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] teaching at the [[University of Washington]] (UW). 

==Education==
Fine earned his Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1963.

==Career==
Before moving to UW, Fine taught for many years at [[Northwestern University]] and, before that, at [[Cornell University]] and the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].  He is a past president of the [[American Philosophical Association]] and the [[Philosophy of Science Association]] and has for many years been on the editorial board of the journal ''Philosophy of Science'', one of the leading publications in the field. 

==Philosophical work==
Fine famously proposed the [[natural ontological attitude]] (NOA) as a resolution to the debates over [[scientific realism]]. This philosophy takes on a neutral stance of realist and antirealist attitudes of acceptance in the industry's best theories, and calls out mistakes across existing theories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/#PraQuiDiaPar plato.stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine also developed one of the possible [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] yet to be decided between and has contributed to the [[probabilistic]] understanding of [[Bell's theorem]]. 

In 2001, Fine gave the following re-counting of the birth of NOA and its important relationship to [[Bas van Fraassen]]'s [[antirealism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The Scientific Image'' arrived in 1980 like a breath of fresh air. Although in the introduction van Fraassen counts me among the realist foot soldiers, at just that time Micky Forbes and I were engaged in rethinking the whole realism/antirealism issue. The result was NOA. Van Fraassen’s powerful and enlightening monograph encouraged us in that project. If Micky and I are parents of NOA, then Bas is perhaps a godfather. Paul Teller too, since he was among the people then who helped us refine our ideas as they developed.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, Arthur (2001) "The Scientific Image 20 Years Later" Philosophical Studies. p.207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In 2014, Fine was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/classlist2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he was recognized for his knowledge of [[Albert Einstein]]'s theories as a guest lecturer [[Ohio University]]'s 2014 Frontiers in Science Lecture Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Arthur Fine Tells The Real Story Behind Albert Einstein|url=https://woub.org/2014/09/23/dr-arthur-fine-tells-real-story-behind-albert-einstein/|website=WOUB Digital|publisher=WOUB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2530">'''Burgundio of Pisa''', sometimes erroneously styled "Burgundius", was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[jurist]] of the 12th century. He was an ambassador for Pisa at [[Constantinople]] in 1136. He was a professor in [[Paris]], and assisted at the [[Lateran Council]] in 1179, dying at a very advanced age in 1193.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Burgundio |volume=4|page=820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a distinguished [[Greek language|Greek]] scholar, and is believed on the authority of [[Odofredus]] to have translated into [[Latin]], soon after the ''[[Pandects]]'' were brought to [[Bologna]], the various Greek fragments which occur in them, with the exception of those in the 27th book, the translation of which has been attributed to [[Modestinus]]. The Latin translations ascribed to Burgundio were received at Bologna as an integral part of the text of the ''Pandects'', and form part of that known as The [[Vulgate]] in distinction from the [[Florence|Florentine]] text.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Fitting, "Bernardus Cremonensis und die lateinische Übersetzung des Griechischen in den Digesten" in Sitzungsberichte ... Berlin (1894) pp. 813-820.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, he translated from Greek into Latin ''Exposition of the Orthodox Faith'' by [[John of Damascus]]; ''On human nature'' by [[Nemesius of Emesa]];&lt;ref&gt;Μ. Morani, "ΙΙ manoscritto Chigiano di Nemesio" in Rendiconti dell'Istituto Lombardo vol. 105 (1871) pp. 621-635.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catholic peace traditions''' begin with its biblical and classical origins to the current practice in the 21st century. Because of its long history and breadth of geographical and cultural diversity, this Catholic tradition encompasses many strains and influences of both religious and secular [[peacemaking]] and many aspects of [[Christian pacifism]], [[just war]] and [[nonviolence]].

Catholic tradition as a whole supports and favors peacemaking efforts.&lt;ref name=Kemmetmueller&gt;[http://www.monitor.upeace.org/pdf/Peace_Catholicism.pdf Kemmetmueller, Donna Jean. "Peace: The Challenge of Living the Catholic Tradition", ''Peace and Conflict Monitor''. May 9, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Peacemaking is an integral part of [[Catholic Social Teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicsocialteaching.org.uk/principles/glossary/#Peace "Glossary", CatholicSocialTeaching.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
[[File:2008. Донецк 122.jpg|thumb|2008. Angel of peace in Donetsk]]

The history of peacemaking in the Catholic tradition reflects the religious meanings of peace, tied to positive virtues, such as love, and to the personal and social works of justice. The Greek word for peace is ''eirene''; Roman ''pax'', and in the [[Hebrew Bible]], ''shalom''.

For the earliest Romans, "pax" meant to live in a state of agreement, where discord and war were absent. In his ''Meditations'', or ''To Himself,'' the Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] expresses peace as a state of unperturbed tranquility. The English word "peace" derives ultimately from its root, the Latin "pax".

Shalom ({{lang-he|שלום}}) is the word for peace in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (''[[Tanakh]]'' or {{lang-he|תנ"ך}}), and has  other meanings also pertaining to well being, including use as a greeting.

===''Eirene''===
The Greek meaning for peace, contained in the word ''eirene'', evolved over the course of Greco-Roman civilization from such agricultural meanings as prosperity, fertility, and security of home contained in [[Hesiod]]’s ''Works and Days'', to more internal meanings of peace formulated by the Stoics, such as [[Epictetus]].

''Eirene'' is the word that the New Testament generally uses for peace, one of the twenty words used by the [[Septuagint]], the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible used in the largely Greek-speaking Jewish communities throughout the Greco-Roman world. It is chiefly through the Septuagint’s use of Greek that the Greek word ''eirene'' became infused with all the religious imagery and richness of the word ''shalom'' in the Hebrew Bible that had evolved over the history of the Jewish people. Subsequently, the use of the Greek Bible as the basis for [[St. Jerome]]’s [[Vulgate]] translation into Latin then brought all the new meanings of ''eirene'' to the Latin word ''pax'' and transformed it from a term for an imposed order of the sword, the ''Pax Romana'', into the chief image of peace for Western Christianity.&lt;ref name=Musto&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rzItAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Eirene Musto, Ronald G., ''The Catholic Peace Tradition'', Orbis Books, 1986] {{ISBN|9780883442630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -31- - Kiss of Judas.jpg|thumb|130px|Christ in Gethsemane commands Peter to lay down his sword (fresco by [[Giotto]])]]

The Gospels present the birth of Jesus as ushering in a new age of peace. In Luke, [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] celebrates his son [[John the Baptist|John]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God by which the daybreak from on high will visit us to shine on those who sit in darkness and death's shadow, to guide our feet into the path of peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PWK.HTM "Luke 1: 76-79", ''The New American Bible'', United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And later, the angels appear to the shepherds at Bethlehem, "And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel, praising God and saying: 'Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests'"{{sfn|NAB, Luke 2:13-14}} – a peace distinct from the [[Pax Romana]].{{sfn|NAB, Luke 2, n.6}}
 
The [[Sermon on the Mount]] (Mt. 5:1-16) and the [[Sermon on the Plain]] (Lk. 6:20-45) combine with the call to "love your enemies" (Mt. 5:38-48) to encapsulate Jesus' teachings on peacemaking. According to [[Gabriel Moran]], the Sermon on the Mount does not advocate submission to oppressors, but rather a strategy to "de-hostilize enemies in order to win them over".&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/classes/gmoran/NONVIOLENCE.pdf Moran, Gabriel. "Roman Catholic Tradition and Passive Resistance", New York University]&lt;/ref&gt;

The account of the healing of the centurion's servant suggests to John Eppstein that Jesus did not view military service as sinful, since rather than reprove the soldier for his profession, Jesus praised him for his faith. Nor did [[Saint Peter|Peter]] require Cornelius to resign his commission or desert upon being baptized.&lt;ref name=Eppstein&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IESe7m8Obe4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Catholic+peace+traditions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SjsJVNrRAfOAsQT3rYDIAg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Catholic%20peace%20traditions&amp;f=false Eppstein, John. ''The Catholic Tradition of the Law of Nations'', Burns &amp; Oates, London, 1935]&lt;/ref&gt; John the Baptist's advice to soldiers was, "Do not practice extortion, do not falsely accuse anyone, and be satisfied with your wages." {{sfn|NAB, Luke 3:14}}

==Early Church==
Early Christianity was relatively pacifist.&lt;ref name=McCormick&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/schools/lsoe/cce/highered/iache/Institutereadingmaterials/jcr%3Acontent/content/download_3/file.res/McCormick.pdf McCormick, Patrick. "Catholic Social Teaching &amp; the Catholic Intellectual Tradition", The Catholic University]&lt;/ref&gt; Clement of Alexandria wrote, "“If you enroll as one of God’s people, heaven is your country and God your lawgiver. And what are his laws? You shall not kill, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. To him that strikes you on the one cheek, turn to him the other also.” (Protrepticus 10)
&lt;ref name=cpf&gt;[http://www.catholicpeacefellowship.org/downloads/church_teaching_quotes.pdf "Selected Quotations", ''War, Peace and Conscience in the Catholic Tradition'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Christians anticipated the eminent return of the Lord in glory, even to the extant that [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] had to tell some of them to get back to work.{{sfn|NAB, 2 Thess 3: 10}} Generally they were not deeply involved in the larger community. As it became apparent that a more nuanced understanding was called for, Christians came to realize that if they were to survive socially they could not remain within the confines of their own community.&lt;ref name=Massaro&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TXTGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Christians+in+the+Roman+Army+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tdtV9iGu5S&amp;sig=IjL4vvTD3nBHwv2KToyhJidpETs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hDcKVLTIO7TCsATHrYCYBg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Christians%20in%20the%20Roman%20Army%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Massaro, S.J. and Shannon, Thomas A., ''Catholic Perspectives on Peace and War'', Sheed &amp; Ward, 2003] {{ISBN|9781461667421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christians in the Roman Army ===
[[File:Simone Martini 028.jpg|thumb|left|120px|St Martin leaves the life of chivalry and renounces the army (fresco by [[Simone Martini]])]]
St. Paul wrote, "Let every person be subordinate to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been established by God. ...This is why you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. Pay to all their dues, taxes to whom taxes are due, toll to whom toll is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due."{{sfn|NAB, Romans 13: 1-7}}

The early Christian church believed that Christians should not take up arms in any war,&lt;ref name=Moran/&gt; and so struggled attempting to balance the obligation to be a good citizen and the question of whether it was permissible to take up arms to defend one's country. There developed a gap between the reasoning of the moral theorists and the practice of the private citizen.

As early as second century, Christians began to participate in Roman military, police, and government in large numbers.&lt;ref name=Philpott/&gt; Military service was one way available to make a living, and on the borders of the empire there was a need to defend against barbarian incursions. As the army came to take on duties more in the line of police work: traffic and customs control, firefighting, the apprehension of criminals and bandits, maintaining the peace, quelling street brawls, and performing the roles of engineering, clearance, and other works of building for which the Roman army was well known, this choice became less problematic.&lt;ref name=Massaro/&gt; The numbers of soldiers that came to be counted among the later martyrs indicates that many Christians served in the military, despite their abhorrence of war.&lt;ref name=Eppstein/&gt;

From about the middle of the second century, officers in the Roman army were expected to participate in the Imperial Cult and sacrifice to the emperor. During the reign of Diocletian this obligation was extended to the lower ranks, as a test for those suspected of being Christian. Christians were therefore counseled not to enlist so as to avoid needless blood guilt and the risk of idolatry, but should nonetheless continue to pray for the civil authorities.&lt;ref name=Eppstein/&gt;
  
Among the better-known soldier saints are [[Saint Marinus]], [[Marcellus of Tangier]], and [[Maximilian of Tebessa]], and [[Martin of Tours]].

===Martyrdom as non-violent protest===
[[File:LawrenceRavenna.jpg|thumb|[[St. Lawrence]]. Mosaic from the Mausoleum of [[Galla Placidia]], [[Ravenna]], Italy]]
Persecutions were sporadic and the third century, largely local. By and large the Roman government didn’t pay much attention to Christianity.&lt;ref name=Philpott/&gt;

Christians sought to live the injunction to love their enemies while resisting their evil, even if this involved persecution and death: these were the [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]]. The word ''“martyr”'' is the Greek for “witness.” The early martyrs followed a long-standing tradition; [[John the Baptist]] was beheaded for "speaking truth to power". They also had as examples St. [[Stephen]], the apostles [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], and [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], and others.&lt;ref name=Philpott&gt;[http://ocw.nd.edu/peace-studies/catholicism-and-politics/lectures/the-early-church Philpott, Daniel. "The Early Church", Notre Dame University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906020731/http://ocw.nd.edu/peace-studies/catholicism-and-politics/lectures/the-early-church |date=2014-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sufferings of the martyrs were therefore not an act of suicide or some masochistic form of passive weakness that found its fulfillment in torture and death at the hands of the Romans. Theirs was an act of commitment carried out in the public arena, designed to show the enemy that what is worth living for is also worth dying for. According to [[Josephine Laffin]], martyrdom demonstrated to all that Christ had overcome  death, and that the Holy Spirit sustained the Church in its fight against darkness and evil.&lt;ref name=Laffin&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W1lmLyFzdkIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Martyrs+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=k0kKVLTrIsTlsAT8rgE&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Martyrs%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Laffin, Josephine. ''What Does it Mean to be a Saint?: Reflections on Mary MacKillop, Saints and Holiness in the Catholic Tradition", p. 85, Wakefield Press, 2010] {{ISBN|9781862549395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Martyrs of Cordoba====
[[File:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The Mosque in Cordoba. Photo:Timor Espallargas]]
 
The [[Martyrs of Córdoba]] were forty-eight Christian martyrs living in the 9th century Muslim-ruled Al-Andalus. Their hagiography describes in detail their executions for deliberately sought capital violations of Muslim law in Al-Andalus. The martyrdoms recorded by [[Eulogius of Cordoba|Eulogius]] took place between 851 and 859; with few exceptions, the Christians invited execution by making public statements tactically chosen to invite martyrdom by appearing before the Muslim authorities to denounce Islam. The martyrs caused tension not only between Muslims and Christians, but within the Christian community. In December 852 Church leaders called a council in Cordoba, which honored those fallen but called on Christians to refrain from seeking martyrdom.

Recent historical interpretation of the martyr movement reflect questions on its nature. Kenneth Baxter Wolf sees its cause in “spiritual anxiety” and the penitential aspect of 9th century Iberian Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Kenneth Baxter. ''Christian Martyrs in Muslim Spain,'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Clayton J. Drees&lt;ref&gt;“Sainthood and Suicide. The Motives of the Martyrs of Córdoba, A.D. 850-859,” ''Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies'' 20, 1, 1990: 59-89&lt;/ref&gt; sees their motives in a “pathological death-wish, the product of unexpressed hatred toward society that had turned inward against themselves” and other innate “psychological imbalances.” Jessica A. Coope suggests that it reflects a protest against the process of assimilation, and that the martyrs demonstrated a determination to assert Christian identity.&lt;ref name=Coope&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;id=vf1JAz1g-cgC&amp;q=Perfectus#v=snippet&amp;q=Perfectus&amp;f=false Coope, Jessica A., ''The Martyrs of C¢rdoba: Community and Family Conflict in an Age of Mass Conversion", p. 14, University of Nebraska Press, 1995] {{ISBN|9780803214712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Constantine===
[[File:Rome-Capitole-StatueConstantin.jpg|thumb|130px|Bust of Constantine. (Rome, Capitoline Museum)]]

With the triumph of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] as sole Roman emperor in 313, the church of the martyrs now found itself an accepted and favored religion, soon to become the official religion of the state. Constantine had an emblem inscribed on the shields of his soldiers that has been various described as representing the "Unconquerable Sun" or as a [[Chi-Rho]]. [[Eileen Egan]] quotes Burkhardt's observation that this was "an emblem which every man could interpret as he pleased, but which the Christians would refer to themselves."&lt;ref name=Egan/&gt;

As the religion of the empire, its survival was tied to the fate of the Empire. The threat of increased barbarian incursions therefore threatened both, and defense of the Empire was appropriate in order to protect Christianity.  The early trend toward pacifism became muted.&lt;ref name=Massaro/&gt;

[[Ambrose of Milan]], former Pretorian Prefect of northern Italy before being elected bishop of Milan, preserved the Christian presumption against the use of violence, unless it was needed to protect important social values. While rejecting resorting to violence in self-defense, he argued that charity demanded one protect one’s neighbour.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;[http://www.socialjustice.catholic.org.au/publications/discussion-guides/133-the-struggle-to-develop-a-just-war-tradition-in-the-west Duncan C.Ss.R., Bruce.

When the Empress Justina sought to have the new basilica in Milan turned over to the Arians, Ambrose, supported by the faithful, occupied it himself in what Egan identifies as an example of non-violent resistance.&lt;ref name=Egan/&gt;

=== Augustine of Hippo ===
{{Main article|Just war theory}}
Following Ambrose, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] thought that the Christian, in imitation of Jesus, should not use violence to defend himself, but  however, had an obligation to aid a victim under attack.&lt;ref name=Moran/&gt;

Augustine of Hippo agreed strongly with the conventional wisdom of his time, that Christians should be pacifists philosophically, but that they should use defense as a means of preserving peace in the long run. He routinely argued that pacifism did not prevent the defence of innocents. In essence, the pursuit of peace might require fighting to preserve it in the long-term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120728203512/http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html St. Augustine of Hippo], Crusades-Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Such a war must not be preemptive, but defensive, to restore peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jknirp.com/mattox.htm Saint Augustine and the Theory of Just War]&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine drew on Roman tradition to view a "just war" as one prosecuted under lawful authority for a just cause, i.e., repelling aggression or injury, retaking something wrongly seized, or to punish wrongdoing. Later other theorists expanded on this. War must be the last resort, have a reasonable chance of success, and produce more good than harm. The church also argued that non-combatants must be protected.&lt;ref name=McCormick/&gt;

Augustine drew no distinction between offensive and defensive wars, since remedying injuries was a just cause apart from defence.&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt; Against the threat of chaos and breakdown of civil order, a man may wage war justly but lament his unavoidable duty.&lt;ref&gt;Markus, R.A., "Saint Augustine’s Views on the 'Just War'", ''Sacred and Secular: Studies on Augustine and Latin Christianity'', p.9-10, (Variorum, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barbarian Invasions===
During Augustine's last days Vandals invaded North Africa. Barbarian incursions which later swept Europe in succeeding centuries resulted in a collapse of learning and culture, and population decline.&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt; There is a long historical tradition that has collected ample evidence to show that the Roman Empire itself was undergoing profound social, economic, and spiritual changes that were only hastened by the invasions. As the Western Empire crumbled the Church became the stabilizing force for order and peace.

The Christian peacemakers of this period were not the dominant cultural or political force of their time, but were either marginalized minorities — as in the case of the Roman Empire or — as in the case of the missionaries who evangelized the barbarians — were actually reaching out from an oppressive and collapsing world to an anarchic one that offered the seeds of a new society. Among the more important figures of active peacemaking or of intellectual life worth further study were [[Martin of Tours]], [[Salvian of Marseilles]], [[Nicetas of Remesiana]], [[Germanus of Auxerre]], [[Severinus of Noricum]], [[St. Patrick]], [[St. Genevieve]] of Paris, [[Columban]], and [[St. Boniface]] of Crediton.

==Monasticism==
[[File:Tentation de Saint Antoine.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Hieronymous Bosch, Temptation of St. Anthony. Madrid, Prado Museum]]

It is no coincidence that the appearance of the first monks comes within a few years of Constantine’s assumption of power and the alliance of church and empire that he forged. [[Thomas Merton]] identified one of the reasons individuals sought out the desert. was that they "declined to be ruled by men, but had no desire to rule over others themselves'.&lt;ref&gt;Merton, Thomas. ''The Wisdom of the Desert'', New Directions Publishing, 1970, {{ISBN|9780811201025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others sought to imitate Jesus' own time spent in the desert.

Monasticism was, in a sense, a continuation of martyrdom, reaffirming the contradiction between the Church and the world, by fleeing from the corruption of civilization in order to seek a greater treasure.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8nt_n7wuugAC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Monasticism+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_3kKVJqTNdXbsATyn4Io&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Monasticism%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Hitchcock, James. ''History of the Catholic Church: From the Apostolic Age to the Third Millennium'', Ignatius Press, 2012] {{ISBN|9781586176648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian monasticism started in Egypt, then spread to Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, and finally to Italy and southern Gaul. [[Anthony the Hermit]] (c.251-356), the founder of monasticism, and [[Pachomius]] (c.290-346) were the prototypes.

=== Penitentials ===
The penitentials, written by Irish monks, were a series of manuals designed for priests who heard confessions that specified certain penances for certain categories of sins. These “penitentials” borrowed inspiration and specific regulations from the early church councils, monastic rules, and the letters of popes and bishops. Many of the regulations at first paralleled those aimed at insuring the special status of the clergy, including its nonviolence, but were gradually extended to the lay population. Penances ranged from fasting on bread and water for week, paying compensation to victims in money, goods or property, exile, pilgrimage, and excommunication. Readmission to Christian community was possible only after the completion of the prescribed penance.

These manuals proved to be such a concise and effective method for conceptualizing and standardizing notions of sin and repentance that they spread from Ireland to the Continent in a wide variety of collections that became enshrined in official collections of church law by the twelfth century. The penitentials are of great value for studying early medieval notions of violence, its seriousness and its consequences in a variety of actions, circumstances, and classes of victims.

The texts assign penances for killing in wartime, even under the lawful command of legitimate authority.&lt;ref name=Winwright&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IT0jKKtIasUC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=Penitentials+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DYwKVJaDE6_jsASQg4HQDw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Penitentials%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Winwright, Tobias.

Following Augustine, war was seen as inherently sinful, and at best the lesser of two evils.&lt;ref name=Allman&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WYRDduxlVf4C&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=Penitentials+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cZAKVNWIFMjhsATQ0IDoDg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Penitentials%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Allman, Mark.

==The Middle Ages==
[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|Charles the Bald with Popes Gelasius I and Gregory I. From the Sacramentary of Charles the Bald (ca. 870)]]

The Carolingian period saw the emergence of both a renewed Roman Empire of the West and the beginning of fresh barbarian invasions from the north and east and the rise of Islam. Internal efforts to legislate the life of the Christian Republic were therefore matched by its external defense against invasions by the [[Vikings]], [[Magyars]], and [[Saracens]]. The problems and conditions were in many ways similar to those of Christian thinkers under the late Roman Empire when the state was identified with Christian society. The [[Carolingian Empire]] thus brought a renewed militarization of society that sought to protect Christendom from external threat, while it used the hierarchical bonds of [[feudal]] oaths and [[vassalage]] to bring the new class of mobile horse warriors, the ''milities'', to some semblance of central authority. War took on a religious dimension as evidenced by liturgical formulae for the blessings of armies and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_CCjUVzFWI4C&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=Medieval+Peace+of+God&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XT9FAGLsG_&amp;sig=ShgxrRhPueknMezp6bMD-M_It_Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DeYNVO3XM_KTsQSexIHoBw&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Medieval%20Peace%20of%20God&amp;f=false "Peace and War in Early eleventh Century Acquitaine", ''Medieval Knighthood IV: Papers from the Fifth Strawberry Hill Conference 1990'', p. 169, Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1992] {{ISBN|9780851153193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The close identification of the Carolingian Empire with the extent of Western Christianity revived the late Roman associations of ''Christianitas'' ([[Christendom]]) with the ''orbis Romanus'' or ''oikoumene'' (the Roman world). On the most official levels Christian peace necessitated its defense against the attacks of external enemies.

Christian peace involved the monastic or ascetic peace of a pure heart and life devoted to prayer; the episcopal peace, or pax ecclesiae, of a properly functioning free and unified church; and the social or imperial peace of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Renna, Thomas. “The Idea of Peace in the West,” Journal of Medieval History 6 (1980): 143–67&lt;/ref&gt; These often overlapped.

Carolingian theory established two, separate, ecclesiastical and secular spheres of authority within Christian society, one to lead the body and one the spirit. Monastic life was supported, and encouraged; while late Roman prohibitions against clerical participation in the army were repeated again and again. Among the thinkers and writers on issues of peace and peacemaking were [[Alcuin of York]], [[Smaragdus of Saint-Mihiel]], [[Paschasius Radbertus]], and [[Hincmar of Rheims]]. In keeping with their time, these offered various interpretations of peace as an inner tranquillity, legal guidelines to war and the curbing of military violence, or the image of peace as an ideal Christian state.

===The Cain Adomnan=== 
{{Main article|Cain Adomnan}}
The '''''Cáin Adomnáin''''' (Law of Adomnán), also known as the ''Lex Innocentium'' (Law of Innocents) was promulgated amongst a gathering of [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Dál Riata]]n and [[Picts|Pictish]] notables at the [[Synod of Birr]] in [[697 in Ireland|697]]. It is named after its initiator [[Adomnán of Iona]], ninth [[Abbot of Iona]] after St. [[Columba]]. As a successor of Columba of Iona, Adomnán had sufficient prestige to assemble a conference of ninety-one chieftains and clerics from Ireland, Dál Riata, and Pictland at Birr to promulgate the new law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://birrhistsoc.com/Hist.htm#cain "Cain Adomnan", Birr Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being the site of a significant monastery, associated with Saint [[Brendan of Birr]], Birr was close to the boundary between the Uí Néill-dominated northern half of Ireland, and the southern half, where the kings of Munster ruled. It therefore represented a neutral ground where the rival kings and clerics of north and south Ireland could meet.

This set of laws were designed, among other things, to guarantee the safety and immunity of various types of non-combatants in warfare.&lt;ref name=foghlam&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/britonsgaelsvikings/lawoftheinnocents/index.asp "Law of the Innocents", Foghlam Alba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002105207/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/britonsgaelsvikings/lawoftheinnocents/index.asp |date=2014-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws provided sanctions against the killing of children, clerics, clerical students and peasants on clerical lands; against rape, against impugning the chastity of a noblewoman, and prohibited women from having to take part in warfare. Various factors, including Marian devotion in seventh- and eighth-century Ireland, may have contributed to inspire Adomnán to introduce these laws. Many of these things were already crimes, under the Irish [[Early Irish Law|Brehon Laws]]. The law described both the secular fines which criminals must pay, and the ritual curses to which law-breakers were subject.

The indigenous [[Brehon Laws]] were committed to parchment about the 7th century, most likely by clerics. Most scholars now believe that the secular laws were not compiled independently of monasteries. Adomnan would have had access to the best legal minds of his generation.&lt;ref name=Grigg/&gt; Adomnan's ''Cain'' combined aspects of the traditional Brehon laws with an ecclesiastical approach. Following Ambrose and Augustine, bystanders who did nothing to prevent a crime were as liable as the perpetrator.&lt;ref name=Grigg&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/5817305/Aspects_of_the_Cain_Adomnans_Lex_Innocentium Grigg, Julianna. "Aspects of the Cain: Adomnan's Lex Innocentium", ''Journal of the Australian Early Medieval Association'', Vol.1, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; "Stewards of the Law" collected the fine and paid it to the victim or next of kin.

Adomnán's initiative appears to be one of the first systematic attempts to lessen the savagery of warfare among Christians. In it he gave local expression, in the context of the Gaelic legal tradition, to a wider Christian movement to restrain violence.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travels-in-time.net/e/scotland12arteng.htm "Adomnán's Law of the Innocents",''Travels in Time'']&lt;/ref&gt; It was an early example of international law in that it was to be enforced in Ireland and northern Scotland, for it was the kings of those regions who were in attendance and signed as guarantors of the Law.

===Peace of God===
{{Main article|Peace and Truce of God}}
As Carolingian authority began to erode, especially on the outskirts of power, as in southern [[Gaul]], the episcopate took steps to protect their congregations and their holdings against the encroachments of local nobles. The Peace of God originated in the conciliar assemblies of the late Carolingian period. It began in [[Aquitaine]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and [[Languedoc]], areas where central authority had most completely fragmented.

A limited ''Pax Dei'' was decreed at the Synod of Charroux in 989 and spread to most of Western Europe over the next century,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Head, "The Development of the Peace of God in Aquitaine (970-1005)" ''Speculum'' ''74''.3 (July 1999), pp. 656-686.&lt;/ref&gt; surviving in some form until at least the thirteenth century.

A great crowd of many people (''populus'') gathered from the [[Poitou]], the [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]], and neighboring regions. Relics of saints were displayed and venerated. The participation of large, enthusiastic crowds marks it as one of the first popular religious movements of the Middle Ages. In the early phase, the blend of relics and crowds, and enthusiasm stamped the movement with an exceptionally popular character.&lt;ref name=Landes&gt;[http://www.mille.org/people/rlpages/paxdei.html Landes, Richard. "Peace of God: ''Pax Dei'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Peace of God'' or ''Pax Dei'' was a proclamation issued by local clergy that decreed immunity from armed violence to noncombatants who could not defend themselves, beginning with the peasants (''agricolae'') and the clergy. It included the clergy and their possessions; the poor; women; peasants along with their tools, animals, mills, vineyards, and labor; and later pilgrims and merchants: in short, the vast majority of the medieval population who neither bore arms, nor were entitled to bear them. Children and  women were added to the early protections.  Merchants and their goods were added to the protected groups in a synod of 1033.

The ''Pax Dei'' prohibited nobles from invading churches, beating the defenseless, and burning houses. [[Excommunication]] would be the punishment for attacking or robbing a church, for robbing peasants or the poor of farm animals and for robbing, striking or seizing a priest or any man of the clergy ''who is not bearing arms''. Making compensation or reparations could circumvent the anathema of the Church.

After a lull in the first two decades of the eleventh century, the movement spread to the north with the support of king Robert, the Capetian. There, the high nobility sponsored Peace assemblies throughout Flanders, Burgundy, Champagne, Normandy, Amienois, and Berry.&lt;ref name=Landes/&gt; By 1041 the Peace had spread throughout France and had reached Flanders and Italy. From c.1018 the Peace was extended to [[Catalonia]] and reached [[Barcelona]], [[Girona]], and [[Urgel]]. Assemblies were repeated all over western Europe into the 1060s.

=== Truce of God ===
The '''Truce of God''' or ''Treuga Dei'' had its origin in Normandy in the city of Caen.&lt;ref name=Watkin&gt;[http://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/12600/document.pdf?sequence=1 Watkin, William Ward. "The Middle Ages: The Approach to the Truce of God", ''The Rice Institute Pamphlet'', Vol. XXIX, No. 4, October, 1942]&lt;/ref&gt; It dates from the eleventh century.&lt;ref name=Moeller/&gt;

While the Truce of God was a temporary suspension of hostilities, as distinct from the Peace of God which was permanent, the jurisdiction of the Truce of God was broader. The Peace of God prohibited fighting on Sundays, and ferial days (feast days on which people were not obliged to work). It was the sanctification of Sunday which gave rise to the Truce of God, for it had always been agreed not to do battle on that day and to suspend disputes in the law-courts.&lt;ref name=Moeller/&gt;

It confirmed permanent peace for all churches and their grounds, the monks, clerks and chattels; all women, pilgrims, merchants and their servants, cattle and horses; and men at work in the fields. For all others peace was required throughout Advent, the season of Lent, and from the beginning of the Rogation days until eight days after Pentecost.&lt;ref name=Watkin/&gt; This prohibition was subsequently extended to specific days of the week, viz., Thursday, in memory of the Ascension, Friday, the day of the Passion, and Saturday, the day of the Resurrection (council 1041). By the middle of the twelfth century the number of proscribed days was extended until there was left some eighty days for fighting.

The Truce soon spread from France to Italy and Germany; the oecumenical council of 1179 extended the institution to the whole Church by Canon xxi, "De treugis servandis", which was inserted in the collection of canon law, Decretal of Gregory IX, I, tit., "De treuga et pace".&lt;ref name=Moeller&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15068a.htm Moeller, Charles. "Truce of God." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 1 Aug. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas challenged the Truce, holding that it was lawful to wage war to safeguard the commonweal on holy days and feast days.&lt;ref name=Watkin/&gt;

===Thomas Aquinas===
In his ''Summa Theologica'', Thomas Aquinas expands Augustine's arguments to define the conditions under which a war could be just:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0029.html The Just War]&lt;/ref&gt;
* War must occur for a good and just purpose rather than the pursuit of wealth or power.
* Just war must be waged by a properly instituted authority such as the state.
* Peace must be a central motive even in the midst of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of Christianity|author=Justo L. Gonzalez|year=1984|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Crusades==
Religious thinkers and secular writers attempted to incorporate the controls of the Peace and Truce of God into the existing warrior ethic by “Christianizing” it into the Crusades and the cult of [[chivalry]]. Beginning in the 11th century, knighthood developed a religious character. Prospective knights underwent rigorous religious rituals in order to be initiated. An initiate had to fast, confess his sins, was given a symbolic bath, had his hair cut to represent humility, and he spent a night praying, his weapons upon an altar representing the dedication of his weapons to the Church and God. Advancements in metallurgy allowed inscriptions and pictures of holy symbols to be engraved on helmets, swords, shields, and other equipment. The symbols allowed for a physical reminder to knights and military men that God was supporting their efforts, providing protection to those soldiers as well as the assurance of a victory over their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/religiousobjects/knights "Religious Devotions of Knights", Medieval Literature and Material Culture, University of Michigan]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis IX of France]] is equally famous for his failed [[Seventh Crusade|crusades]] and for the settlement of disputes and the maintenance of peace within Christian lands. He issued the first extant ordinance indefinitely prohibiting warfare in France, a text dating from January 1258 that outlawed guerrae omnes as well as arson, and disturbances to carts and to agricolae who work with carts or plows. Those who transgressed this prohibition were to be punished as peace-breakers (fractores pacis) by the king's officer and the bishop-elect of le Puy-en-Velay. Louis IX promulgated this text as a simple royal act on the basis of his authority as king.&lt;ref name=Firnhaber&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ems/summary/v023/23.1firnhaber-baker.html Firnhaber-Baker, Justine.

=== Alternatives to the Crusades ===
Christian missionary work was presented as a viable alternative to the violence of the crusaders. Majorcan Franciscan Blessed [[Ramon Llull]] (1232-1315) argued that the conversion of Muslims should be achieved through prayer, not through military force, and pressed for the study of Arabic to prepare potential missionaries. He traveled through Europe to meet with popes, kings, and princes, trying to establish special colleges to prepare them.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Richard Blum: Philosophy of Religion in the Renaissance.

[[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] laid a foundation for [[religious toleration]]. In ''De libero arbitrio'', he noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language, "because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived." Gary Remer writes, "Like [[Cicero]], Erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors." &lt;ref&gt;Remer, Gary, ''Humanism and the Rhetoric of Toleration'' (University Park: University of Pennsylvania Press 1996) p. 95 {{ISBN|0-271-02811-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Erasmus did not oppose the punishment of heretics, in individual cases he generally argued for moderation and against the death penalty. He wrote, "It is better to cure a sick man than to kill him." &lt;ref&gt;Froude, James Anthony

{{See also|School of Salamanca}}
[[Francisco de Vitoria]] was a Spanish Dominican philosopher, considered one of the founders of early international law. He was educated at the College Saint-Jacques in Paris, where he was influenced by the work of Desidarius Erasmus. In 1524, he held the Chair of theology at the [[University of Salamanca]], where a number of missionaries returning from the New World expressed concern regarding treatment of the indigenous inhabitants. In three lectures held between 1537 and 1539 Vitoria concluded that the Indians were rightful owners of their property and that their chiefs validly exercised jurisdiction over their tribes. A supporter of the [[just war theory]], in ''De iure belli'' Fransico pointed out that the underlying predicate conditions for a "just war" were "wholly lacking in the Indies".&lt;ref name=Salas&gt;[http://legacy.avemarialaw.edu/lr/assets/articles/AMLR.v.10i2.salas.pdf Salas Jr., Victor M., "Francisco de Vitoria on the ''Ius Gentium'' and the American Indios", ''Ave Maria Law Review'', 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911001651/http://legacy.avemarialaw.edu/lr/assets/articles/AMLR.v.10i2.salas.pdf |date=2014-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitoria adopted from Aquinas the Roman law concept of ''ius gentium'' ("the law of nations"). His defense of American Indians was based on a Scholastic understanding of the intrinsic dignity of man, a dignity he found being violated by Spain's policies in the New World.

Dominican friar [[Pedro de Córdoba]] OP (c.1460–1525) was a Spanish missionary on the island of Hispaniola. He was first to denounce the system of forced labor known as the Encomienda, imposed on the native inhabitants.

Other important figures include [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] and [[Peter of Saint Joseph Betancur]]

=== Catholic Universalism ===
[[Émeric Crucé]] was a French monk who took the position that wars were the result of international misunderstandings and the domination of society by the warrior class, both of which could be reduced through commerce, as that brought people together.&lt;ref&gt;Oneal, John R., Oneal, Frances H., Maoz, Zeev; and Russett, Bruce.

He proposed that a city, preferably Venice, should be selected where all the Powers had ambassadors including all peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11596a.htm Smith, Walter George.

From 1871 to 1878, Chancellor Bismarck, who controlled both the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia, launched the "[[Kulturkampf]]" in Prussia to reduce the power of the Catholic Church in public affairs, and keep Polish Catholics under control.

===Caritas===
The first Caritas organisation was established by Lorenz Worthmann 9 November 1897 in Germany.&lt;ref name=CaritasDE&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.caritas-germany.org/57320.html |title=The History of Caritas in Germany |publisher=Caritas Deutschland |accessdate=27 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020123903/http://www.caritas-germany.org/57320.html |archivedate=20 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other national Caritas organisations were soon formed in Switzerland (1901) and the United States (Catholic Charities, 1910). It has since grown into "Caritas Internationalis", a confederation of 165 Roman Catholic relief, development and social service organizations operating in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.

Caritas Australia is involved in peacebuilding and reconciliation programs in Sri Lanka, The Philippines, Papua New Guinea and elsewhere, including Movimento de Defesa do Fevelado (MDF) which trains youth to be peacebuilders in São Paulo, Brazil in response to an increasing number of children becoming involved in drugs, organised crime and murders. It is hoped these trainees will become the next generation of leaders in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caritas.org.au/learn/global-poverty-issues/peacebuilding "Peacebuilding and reconciliation", Caritas Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999 almost 900 children and youths from nine different countries and eighteen different religious denominations have participated in the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caritas-peacecamp.org/international-peace-camp/information/ "International Peace Camp in the Middle East", Caritas Osterreich] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006083137/http://www.caritas-peacecamp.org/international-peace-camp/information/ |date=2014-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fascism and Nazism ===
{{See also|Catholic resistance to Nazism}}

Bishop [[Konrad von Preysing]] was one of the most firm and consistent of senior Catholics to oppose the Nazis. He and Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]], along with Cardinal Secretary of State [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], were part of a committee that drafted the 1937 encyclical ''Mit brennender Sorge'' which warned Catholics that the growing Nazi ideology, which exalted one race over all others, was incompatible with Catholic Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Vidmar, John (2005). The Catholic Church Through the Ages. Paulist Press. {{ISBN|0-8091-4234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian Bishop Gfoellner of Linz had the encyclical read from the pulpits of his diocese. Bishop Gfoellner indicated that the dangers of German Catholics were also the dangers of Austrian Catholics: "What I wrote in my pastoral of January 21, 1933. 'It is impossible to be at once a good Catholic and a good National-Socialist,' is confirmed today."&lt;ref&gt;"Austrian Bishop's Plain Words: Can't Be Good Nazi and Good Catholic", Catholic Herald, 16 April 1937 [http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/16th-april-1937/3/austrian-bishops-plain-words-cant-be-good-nazi-and]&lt;/ref&gt; The release of ''Mit brennender Sorge'' precipitated an intensification of the [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]].&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw pp. 381"&gt;Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton &amp; Co; London; pp. 381–82&lt;/ref&gt; With the death of Cathedral Provost [[Bernhard Lichtenberg]] while en route to Dachau, [[Margarete Sommer]] took over supervising the work of Preysing's Welfare Office. Sommer coordinated Catholic aid for victims of racial persecution&amp;nbsp;– giving spiritual comfort, food, clothing, and money. She gathered intelligence on the deportations of the Jews, and living conditions in concentration camps, as well as on SS firing squads, writing several reports on these topics from 1942.&lt;ref name="Margarete Sommer"&gt;[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/ Margarete Sommer]; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgian Cardinal [[Jozef-Ernest van Roey]] was deeply opposed to [[Nazi Germany]], and once said, "With [[Germany]] we step many degrees downward and reach the lowest possible depths. We have a duty of conscience to combat and to strive for the defeat of these dangers...Reason and good sense both direct us towards confidence, towards resistance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,772854,00.html "Prelates Against Hitler", ''TIME Magazine'', 15 December 1941]&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal van Roey intervened with the authorities to rescue Jews from the Nazis, and encouraged various institutions to aid Jewish children. One of his acts of rescue was to open a geriatric centre in which Jews were housed, at which kosher Jewish cooks would be required who could therefore be given special passes protecting them from deportation.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; {{ISBN|0385 60100X}}; p.258&lt;/ref&gt; Papal Nuncio [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Roncalli]] used diplomatic couriers, papal representatives and the [[Congregation of Notre-Dame de Sion|Sisters of Our Lady of Zion]] to transport and issue baptismal certificates, immigration certificates and visas – many of them forged – to Hungarian Jews.

Pallottine priest [[Franz Reinisch]] was beheaded SAC for refusing to take the oath of allegiance to Hitler. When his offer to serve as a medic was denied, Franciscan tertiary [[Franz Jaegerstatter]] was executed as a conscientious objector. Both encountered clergy who thought that they failed in their duty to their country.&lt;ref&gt;Lewy, Guenther.

=== Europe ===
Pope [[John XXIII]] (1958–63) set off a revolution in Roman Catholic thought and life that harkened back to an earlier period for its models and inspiration and brought the church into a new age. Through his policy of ''aggiornamento'' the pope opened the church to the modern world. Russell Hittinger describes the encyclical ''Pacem in Terris'' "as a kind of magna charta of the Catholic Church’s position on human rights and natural law".&lt;ref name=Hittinger&gt;[http://www.pass.va/content/dam/scienzesociali/pdf/acta18/acta18-hittinger.pdf Hittinger, Russell.

Pacem in Terris, Fifty Years Later Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, Acta 18, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; John's successors [[Paul VI]] and [[John Paul II]] furthered this agenda while maintaining traditional church teachings in many areas of individual and social morality.

In the 1980s the Polish Solidarity movement grew out of labor strikes in the shipyard at Gdańsk. It was the first non-Communist Party-controlled trade union in a Warsaw Pact country, and became a broad social movement, using [[civil resistance]] to advance the causes of workers' rights and social change.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksander Smolar, '"Self-limiting Revolution": Poland 1970-89', in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}}, pp. 127-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

British historian [[Timothy Garton Ash]], observed shortly after Pope John Paul II's death, " ...without the Polish Pope, no Solidarity revolution in Poland in 1980; without Solidarity, no dramatic change in Soviet policy towards eastern Europe under Gorbachev; without that change, no [[Velvet Revolution|velvet revolutions]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/04/catholicism.religion13?INTCMP=SRCH |title=The first world leader |publisher=The Guardian |date=4 April 2005 |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Léonie Duquet]] and [[Alice Domon]] were French religious sisters abducted in December 1977 by an Argentine death squad for their support of the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] in their efforts to learn the fate of those disappeared by the then ruling military regime. Later that month a number of bodies washed ashore south of Buenos Aires and were subsequently secretly buried. Duquet was among those later disinterred and identified.

In El Salvador, Father Rutilio Grande spoke against the injustices at the hands of an oppressive government, and dedicated his life’s work to organizing the impoverished, marginalized rural farmers of El Salvador as they demanded respect for their rights. Father Grande and two others were killed by machine gun fire, while on the way to say Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.share-elsalvador.org/2011/03/commemorating-father-rutilio-grande.html |title="Commemorating Father Rutilio Grande", May 24, 2011 |access-date=2014-09-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703044737/http://www.share-elsalvador.org/2011/03/commemorating-father-rutilio-grande.html |archive-date=2014-07-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denis Hurley (bishop)|Denis Hurley]] O.M.I. was the South African Roman Catholic Archbishop of Durban.

"Archbishop Denis Hurley" (obit), ''The Guardian'', February 18, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s Hurley held a daily silent protest, standing in front of the central Durban Post Office for a period each day with a placard expressing his opposition to apartheid and the displacement of people from their homes.&lt;ref name=ncr&gt;[http://www.natcath.org/mainpage/specialdocuments/hurley.htm Page, John. "An appreciation of Denis Hurley, archbishop emeritus of Durban, South Africa", ''National Catholic Reporter'', February 20, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; He received many death threats and was at times subject to house arrest. According to Gerald Shaw writing for ''The Guardian'', "It was in part due to his sustained moral crusade and that of other churchmen that the transition to democracy, when it came in 1994, was accepted by white people in peace and good order."&lt;ref name="Shaw"/&gt; Hurley is remembered for his contribution to the struggle against apartheid, his concern for the poor and his commitment towards a more just and peaceful society.&lt;ref name=Ulwazi&gt;[http://www.ulwazi.org/index.php5?title=Archbishop_Dennis_Hurley "Archbishop Dennis Hurley", Ulwazi]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
During World War I, Ben Salmon was a conscientious objector and outspoken critic of [[Just War]] theology. The US military charged him with desertion and spreading propaganda, then sentenced him to death, a sentence later commuted to twenty-five years hard labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Staff of the Catholic Peace Fellowship| year= 2007| month=| title=The Life and Witness of Ben Salmon| journal = Sign of Peace | volume = 6.1| issue = Spring 2007| pages =| id =| url = http://www.catholicpeacefellowship.org/nextpage.asp?m=2524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During world War II, Out of a total of 21 million Catholics only 223 claimed IV-E CO status, conscientious objection to military service; 135 were eventually classified. Most Catholic objectors chose I-A-O status, noncombatant military service, generally as unarmed medics on the front lines. In addition to these 135 Catholic conscientious objectors, 61 Catholics refused induction and were imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;See Interactive Map of World War II camps for conscientious objectors at: http://www.peacedocs.com/Site/Maps_%7C_Timelines_%7C_North_America,_CPS_Camps.html{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially founded as the War Relief Services, the original purpose of [[Catholic Relief Services]] was to aid the refugees of war-torn Europe. The continuing support of the American Catholic helped CRS expand operations and in 1955 its name was officially changed to Catholic Relief Services. Over time the agency learned that to supply emergency aid without addressing the underlying problems might prolong conflict by providing new resources to the warring parties. In light of that, CRS has re-evaluated how best to focus their activities. In some countries CRS works on providing peace education for children in refugee camps or improving relations between refugees and local inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crs.org/peacebuilding/ "Peacebuilding", CRS]&lt;/ref&gt; It works in ninety-three countries in programs that address hunger, the provision of clean water, and health issues.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crs.org/about/history/|publisher=Catholic Relief Services|title=Catholic Relief Services History|year=2013|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, activities were carried on by such individuals as [[Joseph Fahey]] and [[Eileen Egan]] who were instrumental in the creation of [[Pax Christi]].

==Papal diplomacy and arbitration==
The institutional church, and especially the papacy, long sought to use its authority to promote peace and justice, and like all human institutions, has met with mixed results. The first was primarily in the area of international diplomacy; the second was the realm of canon law and of theology, in attempts to define the limits of war and violence; and the third, among the [[Scholastics]] who investigated the boundaries of individual conscience.

For Medieval Europe, canon law served as a code of international law.&lt;ref name=Mattingly&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GxbnOGK9lMwC&amp;q=Papacy#v=snippet&amp;q=Papacy&amp;f=false Mattingly, Garrett. ''Renaissance Diplomacy'', 1955]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Garret Mattingly, &lt;blockquote&gt;...since the eleventh century, the canonists had been pre-occupied with many of the problems which we think of as belonging to public international law, with the definition of sovereignty, with the sanctity of treaties, with the preservation of peace, with the rights of neutrals and noncombatants, and with the mitigation of the rigours of war.&lt;ref name=Mattingly/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the thirteenth century the Papacy became the first Western power to make a systematic use of diplomacy.&lt;ref name=Mattingly/&gt; 
The papacy, in fact, can be regarded as the originator of many of the most basic elements of modern diplomacy and international law: the protection and safe conduct of ambassadors, the secrecy of diplomatic negotiations, the insistence that treaties and their terms, once made, are to be strictly adhered to, the condemnation of violations, provisions for the release of prisoners and hostages and their humane treatment while in detention, the protection of exiles, aliens, and racial minorities, and the condemnation of unjust wars all derive from the papal position both as the leader of Christian society and as a force for international unity among secular states.

The papacy’s association of peace with justice that motivated its active arbitration in international relations also prompted its interest in another area associated with justice, that of ''jus'' or law. In the international sphere this brought the papacy to adopt the ancient Roman theories of the'' jus gentium'', a body of custom and agreements among peoples and sovereign princes, from the tenth century linked with the revival of Roman law in Italy. Closely associated with Roman law and custom was the notion of the just war, which was Christianized by [[Augustine|St. Augustine]] and handed on to the Middle Ages through [[Isidore of Seville|St. Isidore of Seville]].

*[[Pope Nicholas I]] (858-67) against the backdrop of Carolingian conquest Nicholas penned what is both a “classic summary of Christian faith and discipline” and a harsh condemnation of war. In his ''Reply to the Inquiry of the Bulgars,'' written in 866, Nicholas condemns conversion by force, branding war as a diabolical fraud. While Nicholas concedes that war may be permissible in cases of inescapable necessity, in self-defense, he warns that “in itself it is the devil’s work.” He advises that deserters (c. 22) and those who refuse to obey orders to kill (c. 23) be treated leniently and gives Boris examples of numerous martyrs who fled in the face of violence. In response to Boris’ question as to how Christians are to prepare for war, Nicholas answered that one must employ all the Christian works of mercy that make peace, affirm life, and negate the motives for and works of war.
*During the tenure of [[Pope Pius IX]], Catholics and Protestants collaborated to found a school in Rome to study international law and train international mediators committed to conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-carries-forward-papal-commitment-to-peace/ Gagliarducci, Andrea. "Pope Francis carries forward papal commitment to peace", ''Catholic News Agency'', September 77, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1885 [[Pope Leo XIII]] was asked by Spain and Germany to mediate their territorial dispute in the South Pacific.
*[[Pope Benedict XV]] left a legacy of lasting significance for the papacy and the church in the area of teaching and practice on war and peace. In condemning World War I as a whole without taking sides, the pope did not reason in terms of traditional church teaching about just and unjust wars. He was able to see that modern technology — especially the novelty of aerial bombardment — had made traditional moral calculations and distinctions between combatants and noncombatants increasingly meaningless. Pope Benedict’s influence on his successors is clear in Pope Pius XII’s attempts to use diplomacy to forestall World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://easttexascatholic.com/2014/08/29/wartime-pontiff-started-tradition-of-papal-peacemaking/ Rocca, Francis X., "Wartime pontiff started tradition of papal peacemaking", Catholic News Service, August 29, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906222744/http://easttexascatholic.com/2014/08/29/wartime-pontiff-started-tradition-of-papal-peacemaking/ |date=September 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pope John XXIII]] made Vatican diplomatic resources available in 1962 to the United States and Russia, during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. Over the course of two days, messages was sent between the White House and the Kremlin, with the Vatican serving as the intermediary.

The '''''Chaldean Oracles''''' are a set of spiritual and philosophical texts widely used by [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers from the 3rd to the 6th century C.E.  While the original texts have been lost, they have survived in the form of fragments consisting mainly of quotes and commentary by Neoplatonist writers. They were likely to have originally formed a single mystery-poem, which may have been in part compiled, in part received via trance, by Julian the Chaldean, or more likely, his son, Julian the Theurgist in the 2nd century C.E. Later Neoplatonists, such as [[Iamblichus]] and [[Proclus]], rated them highly. The 4th-century [[Julian the Apostate|Emperor Julian]] (not to be confused with Julian the Chaldean or Julian the Theurgist) suggests in his ''Hymn to the [[Magna Mater]]'' that he was an initiate of the God of the [[Seven Rays]], and was an adept of its teachings. When Christian Church Fathers or other [[Late Antiquity]] writers credit "the Chaldeans", they are probably referring to this tradition.

An analysis of the Chaldean Oracles demonstrates an inspiration for contemporary [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] teachings: fiery emanations initiate from the transcendental First Paternal Intellect, from whom the Second Intellect, the [[Demiurge]] comprehends the cosmos as well as himself. Within the First Intellect, a female Power, designated [[Hecate]], is, like [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]], the mediating World-Soul. At the base of all lies created Matter, made by the Demiurgic Intellect. The matter farthest from the Highest God (First Father / Intellect) was considered a dense shell from which the enlightened soul must emerge, shedding its bodily garments. A combination of [[Asceticism|ascetic conduct]] and correct ritual are recommended to free the soul from the confines of matter and limitations, and to defend it against the demonic powers lurking in some of the realms between Gods and mortals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7f8dH07hBGoC&amp;pg=PA389&amp;lpg=PA389&amp;dq=Chaldean+oracles+gnosticism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oe-VLKU6Xw&amp;sig=YBRsEUtWZ67zKniGHqqfmOLjM3I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xbYjTY7sKsys8AbXh7jjCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA# "The Relation between Gnosticism and Platonism" in ''Sethian Gnosticism and the Platonic Tradition'', p.40]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The exact origins of the ''Chaldean Oracles'' are unknown, but are usually attributed to Julian the Theurgist and/or his father, Julian the Chaldean.&lt;ref&gt;Lewy, Hans. ''Chaldean Oracles and Theurgy: Mystic Magic and Platonism in the Later Roman Empire'' (Paris: Institut des Études Augustiniennes, 1978): “The particular character of the Chaldean Oracles is evinced by the existence of accurate data concerning the biography of their authors.” (q.v. for references and historical challenges.)&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Chaldea]]" is the term that Greeks of the 4th century and later used for [[Babylon]]. It is the way they transliterated the [[Assyria]]n name Kaldū, which was an area that lay southeast of Babylonia towards the coast of the [[Persian Gulf]]. It is not known whether Julian the Chaldean was actually of Eastern descent, or whether the term "Chaldean" had by his time come to mean "magician" or practitioner of mysterious arts.&lt;ref name="Majercik1989"/&gt;

His son, Julian the Theurgist, served in the Roman army during [[Marcus Aurelius]]' campaign against the [[Quadi]].  Julian claimed to have saved the Roman camp from a severe drought by causing a rainstorm.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, pp. 392-393.&lt;/ref&gt; At least four other religious groups also claimed credit for this rainstorm. The circumstances surrounding the writing of the Oracles are also mysterious, the most likely explanation being that Julian uttered them after inducing a sort of trance, leading to the belief that they were handed down to Julian by the gods.&lt;ref name="Majercik1989"&gt;Majercik, Ruth. ''The Chaldean Oracles: Text, Translation and Commentary''. Studies in Greek and Roman Religion, vol. 5. Prometheus Trust, 2013 (1st edn., Leiden: Brill, 1989; Greek text, English introduction).&lt;/ref&gt; No original documents containing the ''Oracles'' have survived to the present day, and what we know of the text has been reconstructed from fragments and quotes by later Neoplatonist philosophers, as well as Christian philosophers who were influenced by Platonist thought. Neoplatonists including [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Iamblichus]], and [[Proclus]] wrote extensive commentaries on the ''Oracles'' which are now lost. The most extensive surviving commentary was written by the Christian philosopher [[Michael Psellus]] in the 9th century C.E. Psellus' work has been an important tool for interpreting earlier and more fragmentary excerpts from the ''Oracles''.&lt;ref name="Majercik1989"/&gt;

Whether or not they were composed by Julian himself, or whether Julian compiled them from actual Chaldean originals, the oracles are mainly a product of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] (and more precisely [[Alexandria]]n) [[syncretism]] as practiced in the cultural melting-pot that was Alexandria, and were credited with embodying many of the principal features of a "Chaldean philosophy". They were held in the greatest esteem throughout Late Antiquity, and by the later followers of [[Neoplatonism]], although frequently argued against by [[Augustine of Hippo]].  The doctrines contained therein have been attributed by some to [[Zoroaster]].

==Importance of the ''Oracles''==
The ''Chaldean Oracles'' were considered to be a central text by many of the later [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers, nearly equal in importance to [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''. This has led some scholars, beginning with F. Cumont, to declare the ''Oracles'' "The [[Bible]] of the Neoplatonists".&lt;ref name="Majercik1989"/&gt;

The essence of [[Hellenistic civilization]] was the fusion of a Hellenic core of religious belief and social organization with Persian-Babylonian ("[[Chaldea]]n"), Israelite and Egyptian cultures, including their mysterious and enthusiastic cults and wisdom-traditions. Hellenistic thinkers philosophized the mythology and [[cult (religion)|cults]], as well as foreign oracular utterances and initiatory lore. Philosophy originating from these two areas, or simply attributed to them, was regarded as possessing knowledge transmitted from the most ancient wisdom traditions.

In Egypt, the attempt to philosophize and synthesize ancient religious content resulted in part in the writings conventionally attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]]. The Chaldean Oracles are a parallel endeavour, on a smaller scale, to philosophize the wisdom of Chaldea. However, rather than the prose writings that came out of Egypt, the Chaldean Oracles originated from the fragments of a single mystery-poem, which has not been entirely preserved. By far the greatest number of the poem's known fragments are found in the books of the later [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophers, who from the time of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], and probably that of [[Plotinus]], held these Oracles in the highest estimation. [[Iamblichus (philosopher)|Iamblichus]] of Syria referred frequently to the Oracles and mingled their ideas with his own.

==Metaphysics of the Oracles==
The metaphysical schema of the Chaldaean Oracles begins with an absolutely transcendent deity called Father, with whom resides Power, a productive principle from which it appears Intellect proceeds. This Intellect has a twofold function, to contemplate the Forms of the purely intellectual realm of the Father, and to craft and govern the material realm. In this latter capacity the Intellect is Demiurge.

The Oracles further posit a barrier between the intellectual and the material realm, personified as [[Hecate]]. In the capacity of barrier, or more properly "membrane", Hecate separates the two 'fires,' i.e., the purely intellectual fire of the Father, and the material fire from which the cosmos is created, and mediates all divine influence upon the lower realm.

From Hecate is derived the World-Soul, which in turn emanates Nature, the governor of the sub-lunar realm.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p. 394-395.&lt;/ref&gt; From Nature is derived Fate, which is capable of enslaving the lower part of the human soul. The goal of existence then is to purify the lower soul of all contact with Nature and Fate by living a life of austerity and contemplation. Salvation is achieved by an ascent through the planetary spheres, during which the soul casts off the various aspects of its lower soul, and becomes pure intellect.

Beneath the world of the Intelligible Triad of Father, the Magna Mater or Hecate, and Intellect lie the three successive descending Empyrean, Ethereal and Elemental Worlds. A Second Demiurgic Intellect represents the divine power in the Empyrean World, a Third Intellect represents the divine power in the Ethereal World. An Elemental World is ruled by [[Hypezokos]] or Flower of Fire.

The Chaldean Oracles were first translated into English by [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]]. They were taken up in the 19th-century [[Occultism|Occult tradition]] and translated by [[William Wynn Westcott]] in 1895.

==State of the text==

The original poem has not come down to us in any connected form, and is known through quotations in the works of the Neoplatonists, especially [[Damascius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalogiratou|first=Androniki|date=2007-01-01|title=Theology in Philosophy: The Case of the Late Antique Neoplatonist Damascius|ssrn=2121421|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W. Kroll published an edition arranging all known fragments in order of subject, and this is the basis of most later scholarly work.  It does not purport to be a reconstruction of the original poem.

Summaries of the poem (and of the related "Assyrian Oracles", not known from elsewhere) were composed by [[Michael Psellos]], and attempts have been made to arrange the surviving fragments in accordance with these summaries: Westcott's translation (above) is an example of such an attempt.  These reconstructions are not generally regarded as having scholarly value, but sometimes surface in theosophical or occult use.

[[File:Philadelphia Baby Farmers.jpg|thumb|In 1904, Elizabeth Ashmead of Philadelphia was arrested, along with several of her associates, and charged with running a "baby farm"]]

'''Child harvesting''' refers to the systematic sale of human children, typically for adoption by families in the developed world, but sometimes for other purposes, including trafficking. The term covers a wide variety of situations and degrees of economic, social, and physical coercion. Child harvesting programs or the locations at which they take place are sometimes referred to as '''baby factories''' or '''baby farms'''.

==Markets==
Child harvesting typically refers to situations where children are sold for [[adoption]], but may also refer to situations in which children are [[Trafficking of children|trafficked]] to provide slave labor.&lt;ref name="AthensMailOnline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NigeriaDailyNews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NigeriaAFP"/&gt; It is particularly associated with and prevalent in some [[international adoption]] markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2009/s2686908.htm|title=Fly Away Children|last=Geoghegan|first=Andrew|date=2009-09-15|work=[[ABC Online]]|accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adoption-articles.com/harvesting_babies.htm|title=ファイナル風俗|website=adoption-articles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://works.bepress.com/david_smolin/|title=SelectedWorks - David M. Smolin|first=Berkeley Electronic|last=Press|website=works.bepress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infants who are trafficked are often eventually forced to work in plantations, mines and factories, as [[domestic worker]]s or as [[Prostitution of children|sex workers]].&lt;ref name="AthensMailOnline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NigeriaDailyNews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NigeriaAFP"/&gt; There have been a very few allegations of some child harvesting programs that provide infants to be [[torture]]d or [[sacrifice]]d in [[black magic]] or [[witchcraft]] rituals.&lt;ref name="NigeriaBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NigeriaNews24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NigeriaTheGuardian"/&gt; Nigerian security agents have uncovered a series of alleged baby factories in recent years, notably in the southeastern part of the country.

Human trafficking is widespread in west Africa, where children are bought from their families to work in plantations, mines and factories or as domestic help.

Others are sold into prostitution, and less commonly they are tortured or sacrificed in black magic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Nigeria-frees-16-in-baby-factory-raid-20130620|title=Child harvesting/ Baby factories|last=|first=|date=June 2013|work=|accessdate=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human trafficking, including selling children, is prohibited under Nigerian law (PDF), but almost 10 years ago a UNESCO report (PDF) on human trafficking in Nigeria identified the business as the country’s third-most common crime behind financial fraud and drug trafficking, and the situation certainly has not improved. At least 10 children are reportedly sold every day across the country. They are now being sold like commodities and, as a responsible government, we cannot allow this to continue to exist in Enugu State,” Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, governor of Enugu, said while inaugurating the committee last month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/exposed-nigerias-notorious-baby-factories?ref=scroll|title=baby factories|last=|first=|date=October 2015|work=|accessdate=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
Child harvesting in Nigeria is a subset of [[human trafficking]]. It often takes place in structures disguised as maternity homes, orphanages, clinics and small scale factories&lt;ref&gt;Eseadi, C., Ikechukwu-Ilomuanya, A. B., Achagh, W., &amp; Ogbuabor, S. E. (2015). Prevalence of baby factory in Nigeria: An emergent form of child abuse, trafficking and molestation of women. International Journal of Interdisciplinary Research Methods, 2(1), 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; where pregnant girls live and deliver babies in return for monetary compensation. The trend is precipitated by various factors including a social premium placed on child bearing and social stigmas around infertility and teenage pregnancy. A [[black market]] for newly born babies has developed in parts of the country to provide infants to wealthy families who prefer cheaper clandestine methods as a substitute for [[surrogacy]], [[in vitro fertilization]], [[assisted reproductive technology]] or adoption through social services.&lt;ref name="makinde"&gt;[http://tva.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/07/23/1524838015591588 Makinde OA, Olaleye O, Makinde OO, Huntley SS, Brown B. (July 2015). Baby Factories in Nigeria: Starting the Discussion Toward a National Prevention Policy. Trauma Violence Abuse &amp;#91;Internet&amp;#93;.  (cited July 24, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the women whose children are sold are young unmarried women from lower-income households who are scared of social stigmatization as a result of an unwanted teenage pregnancy. Some of the young girls come to the baby factory after searching for abortion clinics, though others have been kidnapped.&lt;ref name="makinde"/&gt; Most of the discovered baby factories are found in Southern Nigeria with high incidence in [[Ondo State|Ondo]], [[Ogun State|Ogun]], [[Imo State|Imo]], [[Akwa Ibom]] [[Abia State|Abia]] and [[Anambra]].&lt;ref name="makinde"/&gt;

The first publicly reported case of a baby factory was published by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation in 2006.&lt;ref name="makinde"/&gt; In 2008, a network of baby factories claiming to be [[orphanage]]s, was revealed in [[Enugu]], [[Enugu State]] ([[Nigeria]]) by police raids.&lt;ref name=NigeriaAFP&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5joyO03Khbbuw9SmkX-ce_PdamESQ?docId=CNG.3fe18ab5af9d3cb2bd07a5efa1d18035.651 Nigerian 'baby factory' raided, 32 teenage girls freed], ''[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]'', Jun 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NigeriaFoxNews&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,452613,00.html Police Raids Reveal Alleged Network of 'Baby Farms'], ''[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]'', November 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NigeriaCBSNews&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20068184-503543.html 32 teens freed in Nigeria "baby factory" raid], ''[[CBS News]]'', June 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Nigerian police raided two more hospitals, thereby dismantling two baby factories: in June, thirty-two pregnant women were found in [[Aba, Abia|Aba]], [[Abia State|Abia]] in  a hospital of ''The Cross Foundation'';&lt;ref name=NigeriaBBC&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13622679 Nigeria 'baby farm' girls rescued by Abia state police], ''[[BBC]]'', June 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NigeriaTheGuardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/jun/02/nigeria-baby-farm-raided-human-trafficking Nigerian 'baby farm' raided – 32 pregnant girls rescued], ''[[The Guardian]]'', June 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NigeriaDailyNews&gt;[http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-06-02/news/29631752_1_pregnant-teens-human-trafficking-teen-girls Police in Nigeria free 32 pregnant teens from 'baby factory;' newborns sold into labor, sex markets], ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', June 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in October, seventeen pregnant women (thirty according to some sources&lt;ref name=Nigeria247ureports&gt;[http://247ureports.com/2011/10/police-arrest-30-pregnant-teenagers-proprietor-at-anambra-motherless-home/ Police Arrest 30 Pregnant Teenagers, Proprietor At Anambra Motherless Home], ''[[247ureports]]'', October 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NigeriaTheGuardianN&gt;[http://odili.net/news/source/2011/oct/16/7.html Police arrest 30 pregnant teenagers, others at motherless babies home], ''[[The Guardian (Nigeria)|The Guardian]]'', October 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) were found in [[Ihiala]], [[Anambra State|Anambra]] in a hospital of the ''Iheanyi Ezuma Foundation''.&lt;ref name=NigeriaNews24&gt;[http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Nigerian-baby-factory-raided-20111015 Nigerian baby factory raided], ''[[News24]]'', October 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NigeriaTheNation&gt;[http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index.php/news/22925-17-pregnant-teenagers-arrested-in-anambra-baby-factory.html 17 pregnant teenagers arrested in Anambra baby factory], ''[[The Nation (Nigeria)|The Nation]]'', October 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Five more baby factories were discovered in 2013, and eight more were discovered in 2015.&lt;ref name="makinde"/&gt; Infertile women are noted to be major patrons of these baby factories due to the stigmatization of childless couples in Southern Nigeria and issues around cultural acceptability of surrogacy and adoption. These practices have contributed to the growth in the industry which results in physical, psychological, and sexual violence to the victims.

== Prevention ==
Tackling baby factories will involve a multifaceted approach that includes advocacy and enacting of legislation barring baby factories and infant trafficking and harsh consequences for their patrons. Also, programs to educate young girls on preventing unwanted pregnancies are needed. Methods of improving awareness and acceptability of adoption and surrogacy and reducing the administrative and legal bottlenecks associated with these options for infertile couples should be explored to diminish the importance of baby factories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2015|title=Child harvesting|url=|journal=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1524838015591588|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coin3D''' is a [[free and open-source]] implementation ([[Library (computing)|library]]) of the [[Open Inventor]] [[Application programming interface|API]]. Coin3D was originally developed and maintained as commercial software by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] company [[Kongsberg Gruppen|Kongsberg Oil &amp; Gas Technologies]] (formerly [[Kongsberg SIM]]).&lt;ref name=Coin3DBitBucketRepository /&gt; Coin3D, like Open Inventor, is a C++ object oriented retained mode 3D graphics API used to provide a higher layer of programming for [[OpenGL]]. The API provides a number of common graphics rendering constructs to developers such as [[scene graph]]s to accomplish this. Coin3D is fully compatible with the Open Inventor API version 2.1.&lt;ref name=Coin3DBitBucketRepository /&gt; Coin3D is being used by many small and large companies to drive advanced visualization solution in a wide range of application domains such as geo-modelling, CAD, medical visualization, robotics and presentation.

== Uses ==

According to [[Kongsberg Gruppen|Kongsberg Oil &amp; Gas Technologies]], the software is used in a number of commercial and [[open-source software|open-source]], [[scientific visualization]] or [[3D modeling]] projects such as [[OpenRAVE]]. [[Apple Inc|Apple]], for example, uses Coin for 3D rendering in [[iWork]] '08 and later.  [[FreeCAD]] adopted Coin3D to an interface for developing Open Inventor programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freecadamusements.blogspot.com/2012/08/open-cascade-and-open-inventor-docs.html ''Mr Parry's blog on his FreeCAD development.''] by Luke A. Parry, [http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Contributors FreeCAD Developer]&lt;/ref&gt;

== License History ==
From 1998 to 2011 Coin3D was developed and maintained by Systems in Motion (SIM), later renamed to [[Kongsberg SIM]], later merged into the parent company Kongsberg Oil &amp; Gas Technologies [[Kongsberg Gruppen]]. During this period Coin3D was available under a [[dual licensing|dual license]] scheme: [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] or a proprietary commercial license. Mid-2011, Kongsberg decided to end Coin3D as a commercial product due to diminishing demand and changing business focus. As a service to the user community Kongsberg re-licensed Coin3D under the less restrictive [[BSD licenses#3-clause|BSD 3-clause license]].&lt;ref name=Coin3DBitBucketRepository /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mailman.coin3d.org/pipermail/coin-discuss/2011-November/018377.html|title=Coin3D Mailing List|date=2011-11-18|publisher=Kongsberg Oil &amp; Gas Technologies|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414170923/http://mailman.coin3d.org/pipermail/coin-discuss/2011-November/018377.html|archivedate=2013-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LetterCommercialLicenseEOL&gt;[https://bitbucket.org/Coin3D/coin/wiki/EndOfLifeLetter November 1st 2011, Coin3D Professional Edition License End Of Life Letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

The BSD licensed source code is available at Bitbucket.&lt;ref name=Coin3DBitBucketRepository&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bitbucket.org/Coin3D/coin/overview |title=Coin3D / Coin &amp;mdash; Bitbucket |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integration with GUI Development Kits ==

[[Kongsberg Gruppen|Kongsberg Oil &amp; Gas Technologies]] also develops software development libraries designed to integrate Coin3D with GUI development environments.
*For developers targeting multi-platform - 'Quarter' provides a seamless integration with the [[Qt (software)|Qt framework]].
*For developers targeting Windows - 'SoWin' integrates with the Win32 API, and 'Nickel' provides integration with WinForms/.Net (prototype implementation, not officially supported yet).
*For developers targeting Mac OS X  - [http://www.coin3d.org/doc/mac/Sc21/ Sc21]  provides integration with Apple's Cocoa framework
Legacy GUI bindings are Qt (SoQt), Win32 API (SoWin) and [[Motif (software)|Motif]] (SoXt) are also maintained.

== Language bindings ==
Coin3D is written in C++, but can be access from other programming languages using available [[language binding|bindings]]. Bindings have been developed for Python [https://web.archive.org/web/20090309052042/http://pivy.coin3d.org/ Pivy], Java and JavaScript. Nickel provides access to most of the Coin3D functionality from .NET.

{{Tort law}}
'''''{{lang|la|Ex turpi causa non oritur actio}}''''' ([[Latin]] "from a dishonorable cause an action does not arise") is a [[legal doctrine]] which states that a [[plaintiff]] will be unable to pursue [[legal remedy]] if it arises in connection with his own illegal act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-glossary.org/ex-turpi-causa-non-oritur-actio/ |title=Legal Definition of Ex turpi causa non oritur actio |publisher=legal-glossary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly relevant in the law of [[contract]], [[tort]] and [[trusts]],&lt;ref&gt;Winfield &amp; Jolowicz on Tort, 15th edition, 866, suggest that the doctrine should be purely confined to contract&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|la|ex turpi causa}}'' is also known as the '''illegality defence''', since a defendant may plead that even though, for instance, he broke a contract, conducted himself negligently or broke an equitable duty, nevertheless a claimant by reason of his own illegality cannot sue.
The UK Supreme Court provided a thorough reconsideration of the doctrine in 2016 in [[ Patel v Mirza]].&lt;ref&gt;[2016] UKSC 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In the early case of ''[[Holman v Johnson]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1775) 1 Cowp 341, 343&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Mansfield]] CJ set out the rationale for the illegality doctrine.

{{quote|The objection, that a contract is immoral or illegal as between plaintiff and defendant, sounds at all times very ill in the mouth of the defendant. It is not for his sake, however, that the objection is ever allowed; but it is founded in general principles of policy, which the defendant has the advantage of, contrary to the real justice, as between him and the plaintiff, by accident, if I may say so. The principle of public policy is this; ''{{lang|la|ex dolo malo non oritur actio}}'' ["no action arises from deceit"]. No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act. If, from the plaintiff's own standing or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ''{{lang|la|ex turpi causa}}'' ["from an immoral cause"], or the transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says he has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff. So if the plaintiff and defendant were to change sides, and the defendant was to bring his action against the plaintiff, the latter would then have the advantage of it; for where both were equally in fault, ''{{lang|la|[[potior est conditio defendentis]]}}'' ["stronger is the position of the defendant"].}}

==English law==
{{main article|Illegality in English law}}

===Tort===
{{see also|English tort law}}
In the law of [[tort]], the principle would prevent a criminal from bringing a claim against (for example) a fellow criminal. In ''[[National Coal Board v England]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1954] AC 403&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyril Asquith, Baron Asquith of Bishopstone|Lord Asquith]] said,

{{quote|If two burglars, A and B, agree to open a safe by means of explosives, and A so negligently handles the explosive charge as to injure B, B might find some difficulty in maintaining an action for negligence against A.}}

In ''[[Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd]]'' [2002] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1821.html EWCA Civ 1821]&lt;/ref&gt; an employee who had obtained his position by concealing his epilepsy was held not to be entitled to claim compensation for future loss of earnings as a result of his employer's negligence, since his deception (resulting in a pecuniary advantage contrary to the Theft Act 1968) would prevent him from obtaining similar employment in future.

It is not absolute in effect. For example, in ''[[Revill v Newbery]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1996] 1 All ER 291&lt;/ref&gt; an elderly [[allotment (gardening)|allotment]] holder was sleeping in his shed with a [[shotgun]], to deter [[burglar]]s.  On hearing the plaintiff trying to break in, he shot his gun through a hole in the shed, injuring the plaintiff.  At first instance, the judge awarded damages on the basis that the defendant had used violence in excess of the reasonable limits allowed by lawful self-defence and was negligent to the standard of care expected of a reasonable man who found himself in such a situation. On appeal the defendant raised the defence of ''{{lang|la|ex turpi causa}}'', but the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that while public interest required that someone should not benefit from his illegal conduct, different considerations applied in cases arising in tort as opposed to those in a property or contract context. Old common law authorities and the Law Commission report (Liability for Damage or Injury to Trespassers) acknowledged the existence of some duty towards trespassers and the defendant could not rely on the doctrine to relieve himself of liability.

The precise scope of the doctrine is not certain. In some cases, it seems that the illegality prevents a [[duty of care]] arising in the first place. For example, in ''[[Ashton v Turner]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1981] QB 137&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant injured the plaintiff by crashing the car they sat in together in the course of fleeing the scene of a burglary they had committed together. Ewbank J held that the court may not recognise a duty of care in such cases as a matter of [[public policy]]. Similarly, in ''[[Pitts v Hunt]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1990] 3 All ER 344&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal rationalised this approach, saying that it was impossible to decide the appropriate standard of care in cases where the parties were involved in illegality.

If the illegality vanishes by result of legislative action (such as if the law that made the act that caused the injury was a crime is repealed) or some subsequent court case (where the law is declared invalid), the tort action will stand. In the case of ''[[Martin v. Ziherl]]'', the two parties were [[girlfriend]] and [[boyfriend]] until Martin discovered Ziherl had given her herpes. Martin sued Ziherl for damages in Virginia Circuit Court, and Ziherl argued that because of the case of ''Zyzk v. Zysk'' since having sex with someone they were not married to was technically the crime of fornication, Martin could not sue Ziherl because she got herpes as result of the illegal act. Martin argued the act was unconstitutional. The court agreed with Ziherl and against Martin. Martin appealed, and the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed, agreeing with Martin's argument that because the United States Supreme Court had decided in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that noncommercial, private intimacy was a protected right, the law making fornication a crime was unconstitutional, thus Martin could now sue since the law that made having sex with someone they were not married to was struck down as void.

===Trusts===
{{see also|English trusts law}}
In other cases, the courts view ''{{lang|la|ex turpi}}'' as a [[defense (legal)|defence]] where otherwise a claim would lie, again on grounds of public policy.  In ''[[Tinsley v Milligan]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1992] Ch 310&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Nicholls|Nicholls LJ]] in the Court of Appeal spoke of the court having to "weigh or balance the adverse consequences of granting relief against the adverse consequences of refusing relief". The plaintiff was ultimately successful in ''Tinsley v Milligan'' in the [[House of Lords]], which allowed the claim on the grounds that the plaintiff did not need to rely on the illegality.

A later case, ''[[Gray v Thames Trains]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2009] 3 WLR 167&lt;/ref&gt;, upheld the basic rule of public policy that disallowed recovery of anything stemming from Plaintiff's own wrongdoing. 

*''[[Moore Stephens v Stone Rolls Ltd]]'' [2009] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/39.html UKHL 39]

===Contract===
The doctrine in the aspect of contract essentially does the same thing as one of the vitiating contractual elements known as 'Illegality' .Here contractual remedies can not be enforced by a court on a defendant if it 
is manifest that the subject matter of the contract is in anyway whether directly or by implication, contrary to public policy or in contradiction with any existing law or custom.
{{see also|English contract law}}

==Major reconsideration of the doctrine by the Supreme Court==

In 2016 the Supreme Court provided a major reconsideration of this doctrine, in [[ Patel v Mirza]] &lt;ref&gt;[2016] UKSC 42&lt;/ref&gt;, over-ruling the test in [[Tinsley v Milligan]] and replacing it with a new set of principles. 
The changes were described as 'revolutionary' by a dissenting judge on the case, Lord Sumption (at [261] in the judgement).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1901">In [[folkloristics]], '''folk belief''' or '''folk-belief''' is a broad genre of [[folklore]]. This category includes a wide variety of behaviors, expressions, and beliefs. Examples of concepts included in this genre are [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[popular belief]], [[folk religion]], [[planting signs]], [[hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]], [[conjuration]], [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]], [[root work]], [[taboos]], [[old wives' tale]]s, [[omens]], [[portents]], the [[supernatural]] and [[folk medicine]].&lt;ref name="GREEN-89"&gt;Green (1997:89).&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk belief and associated behaviors are strongly evidenced among all elements of society, regardless of education level or income. In turn, folk belief is found in an agricultural, suburban, and urban environments alike.&lt;ref name="GREEN-97"&gt;Green (1997:97).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
One of a variety of compounds extending from the coinage of the term ''[[folklore]]'' in 1846 (previously ''popular antiquities''), the term ''folk-belief'' is first evidenced in use by British folklorist [[Laurence Gomme]] in 1892.&lt;ref name="OED-folk-belief"&gt;"folk, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 3 November 2016. See also "folklore, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 3 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common parlance employs the word ''[[superstition]]'' for what folklorists generally refer to as ''folk belief''.&lt;ref name="GEORGES-JONES-1995-122"&gt;For example, see discussion in Georges &amp; Jones (1995:122).&lt;/ref&gt;

(2007). ''Un roman russe''. Paris: Pol.&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[agrégé]] in 1989 and earned his [[PhD]] in Philosophy in 1999. He taught at a [[lycee]] already from 1988 to 2001, was docent at [[Paul Valéry University, Montpellier III]], and a director at the [[Collège international de philosophie]] from 1998 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inmanencia.com/2010/07/vertiges-de-spinoza-tumba-para.html &amp;#91;Vertiges de Spinoza&amp;#93;: Tumba para ZOURABICHVILI"], ''Inmanencia'', Retrieved 01 February 2014 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He committed suicide in 2006 and is buried in the Russian Church of the Holy Trinity in Paris (XVIe arrondissement).

A year after Zourabichvili's death, the Collège international de philosophie and the [[École normale supérieure]] organized a colloquium upon ''Les physiques de la pensée selon François Zourabichvili'' ("The physics of the thinking according to François Zourabichvili") led by [[Bruno Clément]] and [[Frédéric Worms]]. The event took place with the participation of [[Pierre Macherey]], [[Pierre-François Moreau]], [[Pierre Zaoui]], [[Paola Marrati]], [[Paul R. Patton]], [[Paolo Godani]] and [[Marie-France Badie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://revue-klesis.org/pdf/EDITO-FZ-1.pdf EDITO-FZ-1], Klesis Revue Philosophique, Retrieved 01 February 2014 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ciepfc.rhapsodyk.net/article.php3?id_article=129 Les physiques de la pensée selon François Zourabichvili"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324044207/http://ciepfc.rhapsodyk.net/article.php3?id_article=129 |date=2008-03-24 }}, ''RhapSodyK'', Retrieved 24 March 2008 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
François Zourabichvili worked primarily on the concepts of "''event''" and "''littéralité''", inspired by the philosophy of Deleuze.
In addition, he wrote about [[aesthetics]], a discipline in which he centered his interest for the purpose of finding relations between [[art]] and [[game]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actu-philosophia.com/spip.php?article354 François Zourabichvili : La littéralité et autres essais sur l’art.], ''ACTU PHILOSOPHIA'', Retrieved 01 February 2014 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published some articles about the films of [[Boris Barnet]] and [[Dziga Vertov]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2109">'''Henry Edger''' (22 January, 1820, [[Chelwood Gate]] – April 1888, [[Paris]]) was an [[English people|English]] positivist active in the nineteenth century. He was one of [[Auguste Comte]]'s ten disciples.

After studying Law in [[London]] Edger married Millicent Hobson. Although originally a [[protestant]], he abandoned Christianity in favour of [[communism]]. He moved with his family to [[New York City]] in 1851. Over the next three years to things caught his interest, [[Positivism]] and the [[Socialist Community of Modern Times]] an [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[intentional community]] based on [[Long Island]], [[New York State]]. The two interests were combined when he moved to the community in 1854 for the purposes of spreading positivism. He also started a long series of correspondence with Comte which continued until the latter's death in 1857.&lt;ref name="Kofer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koferl|first1=M|title=Henry Edger|url=http://brentwoodpubliclibrary.wikifoundry.com/page/Henry+Edger|website=Brentwood Public Library|publisher=Brentwood Public Library|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his attempts to spread positivism amongst the inhabitants of Modern Times met with little success, and indeed encountered the hostility of its founder [[Josiah Warren]], it nevertheless provided a base from which Edger could promote  Positivism further afield. With his convert, John Metcalf, he provided a range of Positivist reading material available by mail including ''Modern Times, the Labor question, and the Family'' which he written himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Positive community of Modern Times|url=http://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/g/GerritSmith/718.htm|website=Gerrit Smith Broadside and Pamphlet Collection|publisher=Syracuse University Library|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880 Edger left Modern Times and moved to Paris, where he died in 1888.&lt;ref name="Kofer"/&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
The reception of [[Hinduism]] in the [[western world]] begins in the 19th century, at first at an academic level of [[religious studies]] and antiquarian [[Sanskrit in the West|interest in Sanskrit]].
Only after [[World War II]] does Hinduism acquire a presence as a [[religious minority]] in western nations, partly due to [[immigration]], and partly due to [[convert to Hinduism|conversion]], the latter especially in the context of the 1960s to 1970s [[counter-culture]], giving rise to a number of Hinduism-inspired [[new religious movement]]s sometimes also known as "Neo-Hindu" or "export Hinduism".

During the British colonial period the British substantially influenced Indian society, but India also influenced the western world. An early champion of Indian-inspired thought in the West was [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] who in the 1850s advocated ethics based on an  "Aryan-Vedic theme of spiritual self-conquest", as opposed to the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism of the superficially this-worldly "Jewish" spirit.&lt;ref&gt;"Fragments for the history of philosophy", Parerga and Paralipomena, Volume I (1851).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helena Blavatsky]] moved to India in 1879, and her [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]], founded in New York in 1875, evolved into a peculiar mixture of Western occultism and Hindu mysticism over the last years of her life.

The sojourn of [[Vivekananda]] to the [[World Parliament of Religions]] in Chicago in 1893 had a lasting effect. Vivekananda founded the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], an Indian religious missionary organization still active today.

Hinduism-inspired elements in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] were also inherited by the spin-off movements of [[Ariosophy]] and [[Anthroposophy]] and ultimately contributed to the renewed [[New Age]] boom of the 1960s to 1980s, the term ''New Age'' itself deriving from Blavatsky's 1888  ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''.

In the early 20th century, Western occultists influenced by Hinduism include [[Maximiani Portaz]] – an advocate of "Aryan Paganism" – who styled herself ''Savitri Devi'' and [[Jakob Wilhelm Hauer]], founder of the [[German Faith Movement]]. It was in this period, and until the 1920s, that the [[swastika]] became a [[Western use of the Swastika in the early 20th century|ubiquitous symbol of good luck in the West]] before its association with the [[Nazi Party]] became dominant in the 1930s. In 1920, [[Yogananda]] came to the United States as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals convening in [[Boston]];&lt;ref name=Melton&gt;{{cite book |last=Melton, J. Gordon|first=Martin Baumann|title=Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices |year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|ISBN=9781598842043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the same year he founded the [[Self-Realization Fellowship]] (SRF) to disseminate worldwide his teachings on India's ancient practices and philosophy of [[Yoga]] and its tradition of meditation.&lt;ref name="DENNIS HEVESI"&gt;{{cite news |author=DENNIS HEVESI| title=Sri Daya Mata, Guiding Light for U.S. Hindus, Dies at 96 | location=New York, NY | agency= | newspaper=New York Times| date= December 3, 2010 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/us/03mata.html?_r=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In unrelated developments, during the same time [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], a [[South Indian]] [[Brahmin]], was promoted as the "vehicle" of the [[Messianism|messianic entity]] [[Maitreya]], the so-called ''[[World Teacher]]'', by the [[Theosophical Society]].

Another early Hindu teacher received in the west was [[Sri Aurobindo]] (d. 1950), who had considerable influence on western  "[[Integral (spirituality)|integral]]"  [[esotericism]], [[Integral Traditionalism|traditionalism ("Perennialism")]] or spirituality in the tradition of [[René Guénon]], [[Julius Evola]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], etc.

===Neo-Hindu movements 1950s&amp;ndash;1980s===

}}
During the 1960s to 1970s counter-culture, [[Sathya Sai Baba]] ([[Sathya Sai Organization]]), [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] ([[ISKCON]] or "Hare Krishna"), [[Prem Rawat|Guru Maharaj Ji]] ([[Divine Light Mission]])  and [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] ([[Transcendental Meditation movement]]) attracted a notable western following, founding religious or quasi-religious movements that remain active into the present time.  This group of movements founded by [[charisma]]tic persons with a corpus of [[esotericism|esoteric]] writings, predominantly in English, is classed as founding, proselytizing religions, or "[[guru]]-ism" by Michaels (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/abt/IND/mitarbeiter/michaels/cv.html Alex Michaels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125224411/http://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/abt/IND/mitarbeiter/michaels/cv.html |date=25 January 2009 }} "Hinduism Past and Present" (2004) Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-08952-3}}, translated from German "Der Hinduismus" (1998) page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hatha Yoga]] was popularized from the 1960s by [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], [[K. Pattabhi Jois]] and others. However, western practice of Yoga has mostly become detached from its religious or mystic context and is predominantly practiced [[Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine|as exercise or alternative medicine]].

Since the 1980s, [[Mata Amritanandamayi]] and [[Mother Meera]] (the "Divine Mother", self-identifying as an [[list of Avatar claimants|avatar]] of [[Shakti]]) have been active in the west.

==Hindu migration to Western countries==
{{further|Emigration from India|Hinduism by country}}
Substantial emigration from the (predominantly Hindu) [[Republic of India]] has taken place since the 1970s, with several million Hindus moving to North America and Western Europe. In 1913, [[A.K. Mozumdar]] became the first Indian-born person to earn U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Indian American#Timeline]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest immigrant ([[Desi|Deshi]]) Hindu communities in the west are found in the [[Hinduism in the United States|United States]] (3.23 million), the [[Hinduism in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (0.84 million), [[Hinduism in Canada|Canada]] (0.50 million), [[Hinduism in Australia|Australia]] (0.44 million), [[Hinduism in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (0.09 million), besides smaller communities in other countries of [[Western Europe]], ([[Hinduism in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] 0.21 M, [[Hinduism in Italy|Italy]] 0.18 M, [[Hinduism in France|France]] 0.12 M, [[Hinduism in Germany|Germany]] 0.1 M, [[Hinduism in Spain|Spain]] 0.03 M and [[Hinduism in Switzerland|Switzerland]] 0.03 M).
Much of the Hindu presence in Canada is due to the [[Tamil diaspora]] as a result of the [[Sri Lankan civil war]], as well as [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] and [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] immigrants from India - along with a small Hindu community from the Caribbean.

==Hinduism-derived elements in popular culture==
[[File:Bikram Choudhury.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Bikram Choudhury]], founder of [[Bikram Yoga]]]]
Growing out of the enthusiasm for Hinduism in 1960s [[counterculture|counter culture]], modern western [[popular culture]] has adopted certain elements ultimately based in Hinduism which are not now considered necessarily practiced in a religious or spiritual setting. This concerns [[yoga]] in particular, which is widely practiced for health and fitness. As an instance, [[Bikram Choudhury]]'s [[Bikram Yoga]] has attracted many celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mensfitness.com/training/bikram-yoga&lt;/ref&gt;

"Hinduism is attracting Western adherents through the affiliated practice of yoga. Yoga centers in the West—which generally advocate vegetarianism—attract young, well-educated Westerners who are drawn by yoga's benefits for the physical and emotional health; there they are introduced to the Hindu philosophical system taught by most yoga teachers, known as Vedanta."&lt;ref&gt;''Changing the Game: Why the Battle for Animal Liberation Is So Hard and How We Can Win It'' By [[Norm Phelps]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25100">{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Host–parasite coevolution''' is a special case of [[coevolution]], the reciprocal adaptive [[genetics|genetic]] change of a [[Host (biology)|host]] and a [[parasite]] through reciprocal [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressure]]s.

It is characterized by reciprocal genetic change and thus changes in [[allele]] frequencies within populations. These are determined by three main types of selection dynamics: negative [[frequency-dependent selection]] when a rare allele has a selective advantage; overdominance caused by [[heterozygote advantage]]; and directional [[selective sweep]]s near an advantageous mutation.

Theories of host–parasite coevolution include the geographic mosaic theory, which assumes a selection mosaic, coevolutionary hotspots, and geographic mixing; the [[Red Queen hypothesis]], which proposes that parasitism favours [[sexual reproduction]] in the host; and an [[evolutionary trade-off]] between transmission and virulence, since if the parasite kills its host too quickly, the parasite will not be able to reproduce.

[[Model organism|Model system]]s include the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' with the bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]''; the crustacean ''[[Daphnia]]'' and its numerous parasites; and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and the mammals (including humans) whose intestines it inhabits.

==Overview==
[[Host (biology)|Hosts]] and [[parasitism|parasites]] exert reciprocal [[natural selection|selective pressures]] on each other, which may lead to rapid reciprocal [[adaptation]]. For organisms with short generation times, host–parasite coevolution can be observed in comparatively small time periods, making it possible to study evolutionary change in real-time under both field and laboratory conditions. These interactions may thus serve as a counter-example to the common notion that evolution can only be detected across extended time.&lt;ref name="Woolhouse"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng1202-569 |last1=Woolhouse |first1=M. E. J. |last2=Webster |first2=J. P. |last3=Domingo |first3=E. |last4=Charlesworth |first4=B. |last5=Levin |first5=B. R. |title=Biological and biomedical implications of the coevolution of pathogens and their hosts |journal=[[Nature Genetics]] |date=December 2002 |pmid=12457190 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=569–77 |url=http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/689/2/Charlesworth_Woolhouse.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamics of these interactions are summarized in the [[Red Queen hypothesis]], namely that both host and parasite have to change continuously to keep up with each other's adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501548 |last=Rabajante |first=J. |title=Host-parasite Red Queen dynamics with phase-locked rare genotypes |journal=[[Science Advances]] |year=2016 |volume=2 |pages=e1501548 |url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/3/e1501548 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Host–parasite coevolution is ubiquitous and of potential importance to all living organisms, including humans, domesticated animals and crops. Major diseases such as [[malaria]], [[AIDS]] and [[influenza]] are caused by coevolving parasites. Better understanding of coevolutionary adaptations between parasite attack strategies and host [[immune system]]s may assist in the development of novel medications and vaccines.&lt;ref name="Woolhouse"/&gt;

==Selection dynamics==
Host–parasite coevolution is characterized by reciprocal genetic change and thus changes in [[allele]] frequencies within populations. These changes may be determined by three main types of selection dynamics.&lt;ref name=Ebert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woolhouse/&gt;

===Negative frequency dependent selection===
[[File:Negative Frequencie Dependant Selection.jpg|right|300px]]

An allele is subject to negative [[frequency dependent selection]] if a rare allelic variant has a selective advantage. For example, the parasite should adapt to the most common host [[genotype]], because it can then infect a large number of hosts. In turn, a rare host genotype may then be favored by selection, its frequency will increase and eventually it becomes common. Subsequently, the parasite should adapt to the former infrequent genotype.&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mib.2008.05.012 |last=Ebert |first=D. |title=Host–parasite coevolution: Insights from the Daphnia–parasite model system |journal=[[Current Opinion in Microbiology]] |year=2008 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=290–301 |pmid=18556238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep10004 |last=Rabajante |first=J. |title=Red Queen dynamics in multi-host and multi-parasite interaction system |journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |year=2015 |volume=5 |pages=10004 |pmid=25899168 |url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150422/srep10004/full/srep10004.html |display-authors=etal |pmc=4405699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coevolution determined by negative frequency dependent selection is rapid, potentially occurring across few generations.&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt; It maintains high genetic diversity by favoring uncommon alleles. This selection mode is expected for multicellular hosts, because adaptations can occur without the need for novel advantageous [[mutations]], which are less likely to be frequent in these hosts because of relatively small population sizes and relatively long generation times.&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt;

===Overdominant selection===

[[Overdominance]] occurs if the [[heterozygote]] [[phenotype]] has a fitness advantage over both [[homozygotes]] ([[heterozygote advantage]], causing [[heterosis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Charlesworth, D.; Willis, J. H. |title=The genetics of inbreeding depression |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=783–96 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19834483 |doi=10.1038/nrg2664 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carr&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carr, D. E.; Dudash, M.

It is due to a [[mutation]] in the [[hemoglobin]] gene leading to sickle shape formation of red blood cells, causing clotting in blood vessels, restricted blood flow, and reduced oxygen transport. At the same time, the mutation confers resistance to [[malaria]], caused by ''[[Plasmodium]]'' parasites, which are passed off in red blood cells after transmission to humans by [[mosquitoes]]. Hence, homozygote and heterozygote genotypes for the sickle-cell disease allele show malaria resistance, while the homozygote suffers from severe disease phenotype. The alternative homozygote, which does not carry the sickle cell disease allele, is susceptible to infection by ''Plasmodium''. As a consequence, the heterozygote genotype is selectively favored in areas with a high incidence of malaria.&lt;ref name=NIH2015What&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Sickle Cell Disease?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sca|website=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|accessdate=8 March 2016|date=June 12, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306021706/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sca/|archivedate=6 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wellems TE, Hayton K, Fairhurst RM | title = The impact of malaria parasitism: from corpuscles to communities | journal = J.

===Directional selection===
[[File:Selective Sweeps.jpg |right|300px]]
If an allele provides a fitness benefit, its frequency will increase within a population – selection is directional or positive. [[Selective sweeps]] are one form of directional selection, where the increase in frequency will eventually lead to the fixation of the advantageous allele. The process is considered to be slower in comparison to negative frequency dependent selection. It may produce an "arms race", consisting of the repeated origin and fixation of new parasite virulence and host defence traits.&lt;ref name=Woolhouse/&gt;

This mode of selection is likely to occur in interactions between unicellular organisms and viruses due to large population sizes, short generation times, often haploid genomes and horizontal gene transfer, which increase the probability of beneficial mutations arising and spreading through populations.&lt;ref name=Ebert/&gt;

==Theories==
[[File:Geographic MOSAIC MODEL of Coevolution.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3]]

===Geographic mosaic theory of coevolution===

John N. Thompson's geographic mosaic theory of coevolution hypothesizes spatially divergent coevolutionary selection, producing genetic differentiation across populations.&lt;ref name=Laine&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jxb/erp168 |last=Laine |first=Anna-Liisa |title=Role of coevolution in generating biological diversity - spatially divergent selection trajectories |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |date=July 2009 |volume=60 |issue=11 |pages=2957–2970 |pmid=19528527 |url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/60/11/2957}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model assumes three elements that jointly fuel coevolution:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The John N Thompson Lab|url=https://thompsonlab.sites.ucsc.edu/|publisher=University of California Santa Cruz|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=John N. |title=The Geographic Mosaic of Coevolution (Interspecific Interactions) |year=2005 |publisher=[[University Of Chicago Press]] |isbn=978-0-226-79762-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/303208 |last=Thompson |first=John N. |title=Specific Hypotheses on the Geographic Mosaic of Coevolution |year=1999 |journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=153 |pages=S1–S14 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/303208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1) a selection mosaic among populations
::[[Natural selection]] on interspecific interactions differs among populations. Thus genotype-by-genotype-by-environment (G x G x E) interactions affect fitness of the antagonists. In other words, the specific environmental conditions determine how any genotype of one species influences the fitness of another species.
2) coevolutionary hotspots
::Coevolutionary hotspots are communities in which selection on the interaction is truly reciprocal. These hotspots are intermixed with so-called coldspots in which only one or neither species adapts to the antagonist.
3) geographic mixing of traits
::Between the communities/regions there is a continuous "mixing" of traits by [[gene flow]], [[random genetic drift]], population [[extinction]], or [[mutation]]. This remixing determines the exact dynamics of the geographic mosaic by shifting the spatial distributions of potentially coevolving [[allele]]s and traits.

Among plants, ''[[Plantago lanceolata]]'' and its parasite the [[powdery mildew]] ''Podosphaera plantaginis'' have been intensively studied on the [[Aland islands]] in south-western Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Soubeyrand, S. |author2=Laine, A.-L. |author3=Hanski, I. |author4=Penttinen, A. |year=2009 |title=Spatio-temporal structure of host-pathogen interactions in a metapopulation |url =http://www.helsinki.fi/~allaine/pdfs/603624.pdf |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=174 |issue=3 |pages=308–320 |pmid=19627233 |doi=10.1086/603624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''P. plantaginis'' obtains nutrients from its host, a perennial herb, by sending feeding roots into the plant. There are more than 3000 host populations in this region, where both populations can evolve freely, in absence of human-imposed selection, in a heterogeneous landscape. Both partners can reproduce asexually or sexually. The system has spatially divergent coevolutionary dynamics across two [[metapopulations]] as predicted by the mosaic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Laine A.-L.

===Red Queen hypothesis===
[[File:P antipodarum.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Potamopyrgus antipodarum]]'' tends to [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]] when in the presence of [[trematode]] parasites.]]

The New Zealand freshwater snail ''[[Potamopyrgus antipodarum]]'' and its different [[trematode]] parasites represent a rather special model system. Populations of ''P. antipodarum'' consist of asexual clones and sexual individuals and therefore can be used to study the evolution and advantages of [[sexual reproduction]]. There is a high correlation between the presence of parasites and the frequency of sexual individuals within the different populations. This result is consistent with the [[Red Queen hypothesis]] that sexual reproduction is favoured during host–parasite coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jokela |first=Jukka |author2=Liveley, Curtis M. |author3=Dydahl, Mark F. |author4= Fox, Jennifer A. |title=Genetic variation in sexual and clonal lineages of a freshwater snail |journal=[[Biological Journal of the Linnean Society]] |date=7 May 2003 |volume=79 |issue=1 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118833480/abstract |pages=165–181 |doi=10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00181.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the persistence of sex may also rely on other factors, for example [[Muller's ratchet]] and/or the avoidance of the accumulation of deleterious mutations.

===Trade-off between transmission and virulence===
[[File:Tribolium castaneum.jpg |left |thumb |''[[Tribolium castaneum]]'']]

''[[Tribolium castaneum]]'', the red flour beetle, is a host for the [[microsporidia]]n ''Nosema whitei''. This parasitoid kills its host for transmission, so the host's lifespan is important for the parasite's success. In turn, parasite fitness most likely depends on a trade-off between transmission (spore load) and [[virulence]].&lt;ref name="Bérénos"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bérénos |first=C. |author2=Schmid-Hempel, P. |author3=Wegner, K. M. |title=Evolution of host resistance and trade-offs between virulence and transmission potential in an obligately killing parasite |journal=[[Journal of Evolutionary Biology]] |date=October 2009 |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=2049–56 |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01821.x |pmid=19732263}}&lt;/ref&gt; A higher virulence would increase the potential for the production of more offspring, but a higher spore load would affect the host's lifespan and therefore the transmission rate. This trade-off is supported by coevolutionary experiments, which revealed the decrease of virulence, a constant transmission potential and an increase in the host's lifespan over a period of time.&lt;ref name="Bérénos" /&gt;
Further experiments demonstrated a higher recombination rate in the host during coevolutionary interactions, which may be selectively advantageous because it should increase diversity of host genotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fischer |first1=O. |last2=Schmid-Hempel |first2=P. |year=2005 |title=Selection by parasites may increase host recombination frequency |url= |journal=Biology Letters |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=193–195 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0296|pmc=1626206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resources are generally limited. Therefore, investment in one trait (e.g. [[virulence]] or [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]) limits investment in other life-history traits (e.g. reproductive rate). Moreover, genes are often [[pleiotropic]], having multiple effects. Thus, a change in a pleiotropic immunity or virulence gene can automatically affect other traits. There is thus a trade-off between benefits and costs of the adaptive changes that may prevent the host population from becoming fully resistant or the parasite population from being highly pathogenic. The costs of gene pleiotropy have been investigated in coevolving ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and [[bacteriophages]]. To inject their genetic material, phages need to bind to a specific bacterial cell surface receptor. The bacterium may prevent injection by altering the relevant binding site, e.g. in response to point mutations or deletion of the receptor. However, these receptors have important functions in bacterial metabolism. Their loss would thus decrease fitness (i.e. population growth rate). As a consequence, there is a trade-off between the advantages and disadvantages of a mutated receptor, leading to [[Polymorphism (biology)#Genetics|polymorphism]] at this locus.&lt;ref name="Bohannan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bohannan |first= B.

==Model systems for research==
[[File:Adult Caenorhabditis elegans.jpg|thumb|''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'']] 
 
The nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' and the bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' were only recently established as a [[model organism|model system]] for studying host–parasite coevolution. Laboratory evolution experiments provided evidence for many of the basic predictions of these coevolutionary interactions, including reciprocal genetic change, and increases in the rate of evolution and genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schulte |first=R.

[[File:Daphnia fg01.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Daphnia magna]]'']]

The crustacean ''[[Daphnia]]'' and its numerous parasites have become one of the main model systems for studying coevolution. 
The host can be asexual as well as sexual (induced by changes in the external environment), so sexual reproduction can be stimulated in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt; Decades of coevolution between ''[[Daphnia magna]]'' and the bacterium ''Pasteuria ramosa'' have been reconstructed, reanimating resting stages of both species from laminated pond sediments and exposing hosts from each layer to parasites from the past, the same and the future layers.

[[File:EscherichiaColi NIAID.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Escherichia coli]]'']]

''[[Escherichia coli]]'', a [[Gram-negative]] [[proteobacterium]], is a common model in biological research, for which comprehensive data on various aspects of its life-history is available. It has been used extensively for [[evolution]] experiments, including those related to [[coevolution]] with phages.&lt;ref name=Bohannan /&gt; These studies revealed – among others – that coevolutionary [[adaptation]] may be influenced by [[pleiotropic]] effects of the involved [[genes]]. In particular, binding of the [[bacteriophage]] to ''E. coli'' surface [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] is the crucial step in the [[virus]] [[infection]] cycle. A [[mutation]] in the receptor's binding site may cause [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]]. Such mutations often show pleiotropic effects and may cause a cost of resistance. In the presence of phages, such pleiotropy may lead to [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] in the bacterial population and thus enhance [[biodiversity]] in the community.&lt;ref name=Bohannan /&gt;

Another model system consists of the plant- and animal-colonizing bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and its [[bacteriophages]]. This system provided new insights into the dynamics of coevolutionary change. It demonstrated that coevolution may proceed via recurrent [[selective sweeps]], favouring [[generalist and specialist species|generalists]] for both antagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buckling |first1=A. |last2=Rainey |first2=P.

Tropical tree and liana interactions have also been the subject of study. Here lianas have been viewed as hyper-diverse generalist macro-parasites that affect host survival by parasitising on the host's structural support for access to canopy light, while usurping resources that would otherwise be available to their host.

'''Hubert Henry Harrison''' (April 27, 1883 – December 17, 1927) was a West Indian-American writer, orator, educator, critic, and race and class conscious political activist and radical internationalist based in [[Harlem, New York]]. He was described by activist [[A. Philip Randolph]] as "the father of Harlem radicalism" and by the historian [[Joel Augustus Rogers]] as "the foremost Afro-American intellect of his time." [[John G. Jackson (writer)|John G. Jackson]] of [[American Atheists]] described him as "The Black [[Socrates]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jervis Anderson, ''A. Philip Randolph: A Biographical Portrait'' (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1973), 79, and Joel. A. Rogers, "Hubert Harrison: Intellectual Giant and Free-Lance Educator (1883–1927)", in ''World's Great Men of Color'', ed. John Henrik Clarke, 2 vols (1947; New York: reprint, Collier Books, 1972), 2:432–42, esp. 432–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=John G.|first=Jackson|title=Hubert Henry Harrison: The Black Socrates|work=American Atheists|publisher=www.atheists.org|accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An immigrant from [[St. Croix]] at the age of 17, Harrison played significant roles in the largest radical class and race movements in the United States. In 1912-14 he was the leading Black organizer in the [[Socialist Party of America]]. In 1917 he founded the Liberty League and ''The Voice'', the first organization and the first newspaper of the race-conscious "[[New Negro]]" movement. From his Liberty League and ''Voice'' came the core leadership of individuals and race-conscious program of the [[Marcus Garvey|Garvey]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;''A Hubert Harrison Reader'', ed. with an introduction by Jeffrey B. Perry (Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, 2001), 1-2. This work (pp. 1–30) is used for general background on Harrison's life.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison was a seminal and influential thinker who encouraged the development of [[class consciousness]] among working people, [[black pride|positive race consciousness among Black people]], [[agnostic atheism]], [[secular humanism]], [[social progressivism]], and [[freethought]]. He was also a self-described "radical internationalist" and contributed significantly to the Caribbean radical tradition. Harrison profoundly influenced a generation of "New Negro" militants, including [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Chandler Owen]], [[Marcus Garvey]], [[Richard Benjamin Moore]], [[W. A. Domingo]], [[Williana Burroughs]], and [[Cyril Briggs]].

==Early life==
Hubert was born to Cecilia Elizabeth Haines, a working-class woman, on Estate Concordia, [[St. Croix]], [[Danish West Indies]]. His biological father, Adolphus Harrison, was born enslaved. One account from the 1920s suggested that Harrison's father owned a substantial estate.&lt;ref&gt;Winston James, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iSAjTDHiC4MC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=The+Horror+of+the+East+St.+Louis+Massacre.&amp;source=web&amp;ots=dpjHEKZ5q4&amp;sig=gP1NLaYIry6m97DeXqPJvFqfbbI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA123,M1 ''Holding Aloft the Banner of Ethiopia: Caribbean Radicalism in Early Twentieth-century America''], New York: Verso, 1998, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison's biographer, however, found no such landholding and writes that "there is no indication that Adolphus, a laborer his entire life, ever owned, or even rented, land".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey B. Perry, ''Hubert Harrison: The Voice of Harlem Radicalism, 1883-1918,'' New York: Columbia University Press, 2008, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; As a youth, Harrison knew poverty but also learned of African customs and the Crucian people's rich history of direct action mass struggles. Among his schoolmates was his lifelong friend, the future Crucian labor leader and social activist, [[D. Hamilton Jackson]].

In later life Harrison worked with many Virgin Islands-born activists, including James C. Canegata, Anselmo Jackson, Rothschild Francis, Elizabeth Hendrikson, [[Casper Holstein]], and [[Frank Rudolph Crosswaith]]. He was especially active in [[Virgin Island]] causes after the March 1917 U.S. purchase of the Virgin Islands, and subsequent abuses under the U.S. naval occupation of the islands.

==Emigration and education==
Harrison came to New York in 1900 as a 17-year-old orphan and joined his older sister. He confronted a racial oppression unlike anything he previously knew, as only the United States had such a binary color line. In the Caribbean, social relations were more fluid. Harrison was especially "shocked" by the virulent white-supremacy typified by [[lynching]]s, which were reaching a peak in these years in [[Southern United States|the South]]. They were a horror that had not existed in St. Croix or other Caribbean islands. In addition, the fact that in most places blacks and people of color far outnumbered whites meant they had more social spaces in which to operate away from the oversight of whites.

In the beginning, Harrison worked low-paying service jobs while attending high school at night. For the rest of his life, Harrison continued to study as an [[autodidact]]. While still in high school, his intellectual gifts were recognized. He was described as a "genius" in ''[[The World]]'', a New York daily newspaper. At age 20, he had an early letter published by ''The New York Times'' in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert H. Harrison, "A Negro on Lynching," ''[[New York Times]]'', June 28, 1903, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  He became an American citizen and lived in the United States the rest of his life.

==Marriage and family==
In 1909 Harrison married Irene Louise Horton. They had four daughters and one son.

==Career==
In his first decade in New York, Harrison started writing letters to the editor of ''The New York Times'' on topics such as lynching, [[Charles Darwin's]] [[theory of Evolution]] and [[literary criticism]]. He also began lecturing on such subjects as the poetry of [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. As part of his civic efforts, Harrison worked with St. Benedict's Lyceum (along with bibliophile [[Arthur Schomburg]] from [[Puerto Rico]], journalist [[John E. Bruce]], and activist Samuel Duncan); St. Mark's Lyceum (with bibliophile George Young, educator/activist John Dotha Jones, and actor/activist Charles Burroughs); the White Rose Home (with educator/activist Frances Reynolds Keyser), and the Colored [[YMCA]].

In this period, Harrison also became interested in the [[freethought]] movement, which encouraged use of the [[scientific method]], [[empiricism]], [[reason]] and thinking devoid of [[theistic]] [[dogma]]. He underwent a [[deconversion]] from [[Christianity]] and became an [[agnostic atheist]] similar to [[Thomas Huxley]], one of his influences. Harrison's new worldview placed humanity, not a god, at its center ([[secular humanism]]).

In 1907 Harrison obtained a job at the [[United States Post Office]].

Harrison was an early supporter of the protest philosophies of [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[William Monroe Trotter]]. Particularly after the [[Brownsville Affair]], Harrison became an outspoken critic of Presidents [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[William Howard Taft]], and of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

He also criticized the prominent Black leader [[Booker T. Washington]], whose political philosophy he considered subservient. In 1910 Harrison wrote two letters to the ''[[New York Sun]]'' that were critical of statements by Washington. Harrison lost his postal employment through the efforts of Washington's powerful "[[Tuskegee Machine]]", in events that involved the prominent Black Republican Charles W. Anderson, Washington's assistant Emmett Scott, and New York Postmaster [[Edward M. Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Harrison to the editor, NYS, December 8, 1910, p. 8, and December 19, 1910, p. 8; and Charles William Anderson to Booker T.

==Socialism==
Harrison was an early advocate of the [[Georgism|Georgist]] economic philosophy and later clarified that he had believed Georgism was the same thing as socialism.&lt;ref name="Perry 2009"&gt;{{cite book | last = Perry | first = Jeffrey | title = Hubert Harrison the voice of Harlem radicalism, 1883-1918 | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 023113911X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1911, after his postal firing, Harrison began full-time work with the [[Socialist Party of America]] and became America's leading Black Socialist. He lectured widely against capitalism, campaigned for the party presidential candidate [[Eugene V. Debs]] in 1912, and founded the Colored Socialist Club (the Socialist's first effort at reaching African Americans). He developed two important and pioneering theoretical series on "The Negro and Socialism" for the socialist newspaper the ''New York Call'' and for the socialist monthly ''[[International Socialist Review (1900)|International Socialist Review]]''. He maintained that it was the principal "duty" of the Socialists to "champion the cause of the African American and that the Socialists should undertake special efforts to reach African Americans as they had done with foreigners and women." Perhaps most importantly, he emphasized that "Politically, the Negro is the [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]] of the modern democratic idea" and that true democracy and equality implies "a revolution... startling even to think of."&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Harrison, "The Negro and Socialism: 1--The Negro Problem Stated," ''New York Call'', November 28, 1911, p. 6, repr. in ''A Hubert Harrison Reader'', 52-55, quotes p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison moved to the left in the Socialist Party. He supported the socialistic, egalitarian, and militantly radical [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW). He was a prominent speaker along with IWW leaders [[Bill Haywood]], [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], [[Carlo Tresca]], and [[Patrick L. Quinlan|Patrick Quinlan]] at the historic 1913 [[Paterson Silk Strike of 1913]]. He also supported IWW advocacy of [[direct action]] and [[sabotage]]. He commended the interracial, IWW-influenced, Brotherhood of Timber Workers efforts in the [[Deep South]].

Despite his efforts, Socialist Party practice and positions included segregated locals in the South and racist positions on Asian immigration. Harrison concluded that Socialist Party leaders, like organized labor, put the white "Race first and class after."  Harrison resigned from the Socialist Party in 1918 but was periodically referred to as a socialist by others for years afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Perry | first = Jeffrey | title = Hubert Harrison the voice of Harlem radicalism, 1883-1918 | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 2009 | page = 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Harrison, "Race First Versus Class First", ''Negro World'', March 27, 1920, repr. in ''A Hubert Harrison Reader'', 107–09, quote p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  After resigning from the Socialist Party, Harrison increased his activism within the 1920s [[Georgist|Single-Tax movement]].&lt;ref name="Perry 2009"/&gt;

==Race radicalism and the New Negro Movement==
In 1914-15, after withdrawing from the Socialist Party, Harrison began work with freethinkers, the freethought/[[anarchist]]-influenced Modern School Movement (started by the martyred Spanish anarchist/educator [[Francisco Ferrer]]), and his own Radical Forum. He also spoke widely on topics such as [[birth control]], [[evolution]], [[literature]], [[nonbelief]], and the racial aspects of [[World War I]]. His outdoor talks and free speech efforts were instrumental in developing a Harlem tradition of militant street corner oratory. He paved the way for those who followed, including [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Marcus Garvey]], Richard B. Moore, and (later) [[Malcolm X]].

In 1915-16, after a ''New York Age'' editorial by [[James Weldon Johnson]] praised his street lectures, Harrison decided to concentrate his work in Harlem's Black community. He wrote reviews on the developing Black Theatre and the pioneering Lafayette Players of the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)]]. He emphasized how the "Negro Theater" helped express the psychology of the "Negro" and how it called attention to color consciousness within the African-American community.

In response to the "white first" attitude of the organized labor movement and the Socialists, Harrison provided a "race first" political perspective. He founded the "[[New Negro Movement]]," as a race-conscious, internationalist, mass-based, radical movement for equality, justice, opportunity, and economic power. This "New Negro" movement laid the basis for the Garvey movement. It encouraged mass interest in literature and the arts, and paved the way for publication of [[Alain Locke]]'s well-known ''The New Negro'' eight years later. Harrison's mass-based political movement was noticeably different from the more middle-class and apolitical movement associated with Locke.

In 1917, African Americans and others were asked to 'Make the World Safe for Democracy" by fighting during World War I. In the United States, lynchings, racial segregation and discrimination continued. Harrison founded the Liberty League and the ''Voice: A Newspaper for the New Negro'', as a radical alternative to the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). The Liberty League aimed at the Black masses beyond "The [[Talented Tenth]]". Its program advocated internationalism, political independence, and class and race consciousness. It called for full equality, federal anti-lynching legislation, enforcement of the Fourteenth and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]s, labor organizing, support for socialist and [[anti-imperialist]] causes, armed self-defense, and mass-based political efforts.

In 1918 Harrison briefly served as an organizer for the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL). He chaired the Negro-American Liberty Congress (co-headed by [[William Monroe Trotter]].)  The latter was the major wartime protest effort of African Americans. The Liberty Congress pushed demands against discrimination and [[racial segregation in the United States]]. It submitted a petition to the U. S. Congress for federal anti-lynching legislation, which the NAACP did not demand at that time. Harrison commented on domestic and international aspects of the war, writing: "During the war the idea of democracy was widely advertised, especially in the English-speaking world, mainly as a convenient camouflage behind which competing imperialists masked their sordid aims... [however] those who so loudly proclaimed and formulated the new democratic demands never had the slightest intention of extending the limits or the applications of 'democracy.'"&lt;ref&gt;Hubert H. Harrison, "Introductory", August 15, 1920, in Hubert H. Harrison, ''When Africa Awakes:  The "Inside Story" of the Stirrings and Strivings of the New Negro in the Western World'' (New York: The Porro Press, 513 Lenox Avenue, 1920), pp. 5–8, quote p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The autonomous Liberty Congress effort was undermined by the U.S. Army's anti-radical Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) in a campaign that included NAACP leader [[Joel Elias Spingarn|Joel E. Spingarn]] (a Major in Military Intelligence) and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] (who applied for a Captaincy in Military Intelligence).&lt;ref&gt;Hubert H. Harrison, "The Descent of Dr. Du Bois," August 15, 1920, in Hubert H. Harrison, ''When Africa Awakes:  The "Inside Story" of the Stirrings and Strivings of the New Negro in the Western World'' (New York: The Porro Press, 513 Lenox Avenue, 1920), pp. 66–70, esp. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberty Congress protest efforts in wartime can be seen as precursors to the [[A. Philip Randolph]]-led [[March on Washington]] Movement during World War II, and to the Randolph and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]-led [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] during the [[Vietnam War]].

In 1919 Harrison edited the monthly ''[[New Negro]]'' magazine, which was "intended as an organ of the international consciousness of the darker races--especially of the Negro race". Harrison's concentration on international matters continued. Over the next several years, he wrote many powerful pieces critical of imperialism and supportive of internationalism. His writings and talks over his last decade revealed a deep understanding of developments in [[India]], [[China]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], the [[Islamic world]], and the [[Caribbean]]. Harrison repeatedly began his analysis of contemporary situations from an international perspective. Though a strong advocate of armed self-defense for African Americans, he also praised the mass-based non-violent efforts of [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubert H. Harrison, "Announcement", ''New Negro'', III (August 1919), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Garvey Movement==
In January 1920 Harrison became principal editor of the ''[[Negro World]]'', the newspaper of [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]] (UNIA). Over the next eight months, he developed it into the leading race-conscious, radical and literary publication of the day. By the August 1920 UNIA convention, Harrison had grown increasingly critical of Garvey. Harrison criticized Garvey for exaggerations, financial schemes, and desire for empire. In contrast to Garvey, Harrison emphasized that African Americans' principal struggle was in the United States, not in Africa. Harrison did however contribute to the UNIA's 1920 "Declaration of the Negro Peoples of the World". Though Harrison continued to write for the ''Negro World'' into 1922, he looked to develop political alternatives to Garvey.

==Later years==
In the 1920s, after breaking with Garvey, Harrison continued public speaking, writing, and organizing. He lectured on politics history, science, literature, social sciences, international affairs, and the arts for the [[New York City Board of Education]], and was one of the first to use radio to discuss topics in which he had expertise. In early July 1923, he spoke on "The Negro and The Nation" over New York station WEAF. His book and theater reviews and other writings appeared in many of the leading periodicals of the day—including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[New York Tribune]]'', ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'', ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', ''[[Amsterdam News]]'', ''[[New York World]]'', ''[[Nation]]'', ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'', ''Modern Quarterly'', ''Boston Chronicle'', and ''[[Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life|Opportunity]]'' magazine. He openly criticized the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the racist attacks of the "[[Tulsa Race Riot]]" of 1921. He worked with various groups, including the Virgin Island Congressional Council, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], the [[Farmer-Labor Party]], the [[Georgism|single tax]] movement inspired by [[Henry George]], the [[American Friends Service Committee]], the [[Urban League]], the [[American Negro Labor Congress]], and the Workers (Communist) Party (the name at that time of the [[Communist Party USA]]).

In 1924 Harrison founded the International Colored Unity League (ICUL), which was his most broadly unitary effort. The ICUL urged Black people to develop "race consciousness" as a defensive measure—to be aware of their racial oppression and to use that awareness to unite, organize, and respond as a group. The ICUL program sought political rights, economic power, and social justice; urged self-reliance, self-sufficiency, and cooperative efforts; and called for the founding of "a Negro state" in the U.S. (not in Africa, as Garvey advocated). In 1927 Harrison edited the ICUL's ''Voice of the Negro'' until shortly before his death that year.

In his last lecture, Harrison told his listeners that he had appendicitis and would be getting surgery. Afterwards, he said he would be giving another lecture. He died on the operating table, at the age of 44.

==Intellectual and educational work==
Harrison's appeal was both mass and individual. His race-conscious mass appeal utilized newspapers, popular lectures, and street-corner talks. This was in contrast to the approaches of [[Booker T. Washington]], who relied on white patrons and a Black political machine, and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], who focused on the "[[Talented Tenth]] of the Negro Race".  Harrison's appeal (later identified with that of Garvey) was aimed directly at the masses. His class- and race-conscious radicalism, though neglected at some periods, laid out the contours of much subsequent debate and discussion of African-American social activists. It is being increasingly studied.

For many years after his 1927 death, Harrison was much neglected. However, recent scholarship on Harrison's life and the Columbia University Library's acquisition of his papers show renewed interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/indiv/rbml/index.html Rare Book and Manuscript Library&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.columbia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia.edu"&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/news/libraries/2005/2005-10-31.harrison.html Rare Book and Manuscript Library Acquires Papers of Hubert Harrison, Father of Harlem Radicalism]&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia published the "Hubert H.

Harrison Papers, 1893-1927: Finding Aid]&lt;/ref&gt; and plans to make Harrison's writings available on the internet. The forthcoming Columbia University Press two-volume Harrison biography also reflects the growing interest in Harrison's life and thought.

==Legacy and honors==
Biographer Jeffrey B. Perry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffreybperry.net www.jeffreybperry.net]&lt;/ref&gt; writes that, among the African-American leaders of his era, Harrison was "the most class conscious of the race radicals and the most race conscious of the class radicals".  Perry emphasized that Harrison was a key unifying figure between two major trends of African-American struggle—the labor/civil rights trend (identified with Randolph and Owen, and later with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]) and the race/nationalist trend (identified with Garvey, and later with [[Malcolm X]]).&lt;ref&gt;''A Hubert Harrison Reader'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison has been described as "the most distinguished, if not the most well-known, Caribbean radical in the United States in the early twentieth century" by historian Winston James.&lt;ref&gt;James, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iSAjTDHiC4MC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=The+Horror+of+the+East+St.+Louis+Massacre.&amp;source=web&amp;ots=dpjHEKZ5q4&amp;sig=gP1NLaYIry6m97DeXqPJvFqfbbI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA97,M1 ''Holding Aloft the Banner of Ethiopia''], 1998, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an intellectual, Harrison was an unrivaled [[soapbox]] [[orator]], a featured lecturer for the [[New York City Board of Education]]'s prestigious "Trend of the Times" series, a prolific and influential writer, and, reportedly, the first Black person to write regularly published [[book reviews]] in history. His efforts in these areas were lauded by both black and white writers, intellectuals, and activists such as [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[James Weldon Johnson]], [[Henry Miller]], Hermie Huiswoud, William Pickens, Bertha Howe, Hodge Kirnon, and Oscar Benson. Harrison aided Black writers and artists, including [[Charles Sidney Gilpin|Charles Gilpin]], [[Andy Razaf]], J. A. Rogers, [[Eubie Blake]], Walter Everette Hawkins, [[Claude McKay]], [[Solomon Tshekisho Plaatje]], Lucian B. Watkins, and [[Augusta Savage]]. He was a pioneer Black participant in the [[freethought]] and [[birth control]] movements as well as being a [[bibliophile]] and library popularizer. He created "Poetry for the People" columns in various publications, including the ''New Negro'' magazine (1919), Garvey's ''[[Negro World]]'' (1920), and the International Colored Unity League's ''The Voice of the Negro'' (1927).&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Harrison Papers, Rare Book and Manuscript Library, [[Columbia University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A sampling of his varied work and poetry appears in the edited collection ''A Hubert Harrison Reader'' (2001). His collected writings are found in the Hubert H. Harrison Papers (which also contain a detailed [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/libraries/inside/projects/findingaids/scans/pdfs/Harrison_Hubert_H.pdf Finding Aid]) at the Rare Book and Manuscript Library of Columbia University. Other writings appear in his two books ''The Negro and the Nation'' (1917) and ''When Africa Awakes''. A two-volume biography by Jeffrey B. Perry is being published by [[Columbia University Press]].

A '''Jabberwocky sentence''' is a type of sentence of interest in [[neurolinguistics]].  Jabberwocky sentences take their name from the language of [[Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carroll's]] well-known poem "[[Jabberwocky]]".  In the poem, Carroll uses correct English grammar and syntax, but many of the words are made up and merely suggest meaning.  A Jabberwocky sentence is therefore a sentence which uses correct grammar and syntax but contains nonsense words, rendering it semantically meaningless.

== Interest in neurolinguistics ==

Jabberwocky sentences are of interest in the field of [[neurolinguistics]], because they allow for the study of syntactic processing in the absence of semantic content. A study by Hahne and Jescheniak (2001) demonstrated that test subjects presented with blocks of Jabberwocky sentence trials and blocks of regular sentence trials at least one week apart demonstrated an [[early left anterior negativity]] or N150 in the [[event-related potential|event-related potential recording]] upon encountering a phrase structure violation in either type of sentence.  The N150 was followed by a [[P600 (neuroscience)|P600]], indicating an attempted reinterpretation of the sentence by the brain.  While the N150 is expected in the presence of phrase structure violation in normal sentences, in a Jabberwocky sentence, it indicates the processing of morpho-syntactical structure in the absence of lexical semantic content.  This implies the existence of a syntactic pattern recognizer, which would interpret word class based on [[inflectional morphology]] and word order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hahne | first1 = Anja | last2 = Jescheniak | first2 = Jörg D | year = 2001 | title = What's left if the Jabberwock gets the semantics? An ERP investigation into semantic and syntactic processes during auditory sentence comprehension | url = | journal = Cognitive Brain Research | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 199–212 | doi = 10.1016/S0926-6410(00)00071-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A second study by Silva-Pereyra et al. showed that preschoolers at the age of 36 months demonstrate similar processing patterns compared to adults when processing normal sentences with phrase structure violations, showing ERP activity analogous to the N150 and P600 in adults, but shifted later in time.  When presented with phrase-structure violations in Jabberwocky sentences, however, preschoolers demonstrate activity analogous to a [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]], typically associated with the extraction of meaning from words in adults, along with a diminished P600.  This implies that semantics plays a role in syntactic processing in children and provides neurobiological evidence for interactive theories over modular theories of semantic and syntactic processing.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Silva-Pereyra, Barbara T. Conboy, Lindsay Klarman, Patricia K. Kuhl . Grammatical Processing without Semantics?

In [[United States copyright law]] and [[jurisprudence]] established under the doctrine of ''[[stare decisis]]'' by the case of ''Netbula, LLC v. Symantec Corp.'', 516 F. Supp.2d 1137 ([[United States District Court for the Ninth District of California|N.D.Cal.]] 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Netbula, LLC v. Symantec Corp., 516 F. Supp.2d 1137 (N.D.Cal. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and related cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decoderpro.com/k/docket/218.pdf] Netbula, LLC v. Storage Technology Corporation et al., 2008 U.S. Dist LEXIS 4119 (N.D. Cal., January 18, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The cases defined the boundaries of [[property rights]] and contractual rights in the licensing of [[digital works]].  It is so called because the cases were decided by two renowned American judges and leading jurists, former U.S. District Judge [[Martin Jenkins]] (now a [[Justice]] in [[California Courts of Appeal]]) and Magistrate Judge Elizabeth D. Laporte.

The basic principles of the doctrine can be summarized:

(1) If an accused infringer did not see or agree to copy restriction, there was no infringement;

(2) A "one user on one computer" restriction does not limit the scope of a software license, it's an independent contractual covenant;

(3) A termination clause in the license agreement does not limit the scope of the license, it's an independent contractual covenant.

The ingenious observation Justice Jenkins made was that in a copyright action, although license is an affirmative defense to infringement, the "plaintiff’s initial hurdle is proving the terms of the license." 516 F. Supp. 2d at 1151. The Jenkins–Laporte doctrine provides a legal foundation for circumvention of the exclusive rights provided by the Copyright Act, as the doctrine requires the copyright owner to prove the negative.

'''The Great Zen Master Jeongang Yeongshin''' ({{lang-ko|전강영신대선사,}} {{zh| 田岡永信大禪師)}}; 1898 {{spaced ndash}} 1975)  was a [[Korean Seon|Zen]] Master of the [[Jogye]] Order of [[Korean Buddhism]]. He used the principle of [[Koan|Kong-an]] ({{lang-ko|공안}}) as a way to lead his disciples to [[Buddhist enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

==Career==

Zen Master Jeongang entered the Hae In Temple [[monastery]] (해인사) to become a [[monk]] when he was 16 years old and after 7 years of intense self-training he attained Enlightenment.

At age 25, he received Dharma Transmission from Zen Master [[Mangong]]. Zen Master Jeongang later became the ‘Josil’, or supreme patriarch, of Tongdo Temple when he was 33, the youngest in the history of Korean Buddhism. These achievements at such a young age are legendary in Korean Buddhism. Later he acted as Josil in the mediation halls of many famous temples within Korea including; Beobjusa, Mangwolsa, Donghwasa, Beomeosa, Cheonchuksa, Yongjusa and Jeonggaksa.&lt;ref&gt;"Jeongang Yeongsin (1898~1975)". [http://www.koreanbuddhism.net/bbs/board.php?bo_table=1030&amp;wr_id=139/ Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, Choeng-Gwang (2002). ''Venerable monks in modern Korea - Jeongang sunim''. Wooribooks. {{ISBN|9788975611933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Hue (2000). ''Finding Enlightened people - Biography of Jeongang''.

==Dharma Transmission (Inga)==

After receiving Dharma Transmission from Zen Master [[Mangong]], Zen Master Jeongang’s Enlightenment was confirmed and recognized by 6 Zen Masters of the time in Korea: Masters Hyebong, Hyewol, Hanam, Geumbong, Bowol and Yongseong.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, Jae-Hyeon (2008). ''Dalda(Sweet!)''. Baroboin Publication. {{ISBN|9788986214765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death (Nirvana) ==

On January 13, 1975, while giving a Dharma Lecture in the meditation hall at Yonghwa Temple, Beopbo, Zen Master Jeongang asked the audience, "What is the purpose of life and death?". When nobody answered, he said, "Hak! Even backwards, 9 times 9 is 81.At that very moment he is said to have attained Nirvana" 
&lt;ref&gt;"86. Jeongang Yeongsin". [http://www.ibulgyo.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=102427/ Bulgyo Sinmun ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dame Susan Jocelyn Bell Burnell''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|DBE|FRS|FRSE|FRAS|FInstP}} ({{IPAc-en|b|ɜr|ˈ|n|ɛ|l}}; born 15 July 1943) is an [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] from [[Northern Ireland]] who, as a postgraduate student, co-discovered the first radio [[pulsar]]s in 1967.{{sfn|Cosmic Search Vol. 1}} She was credited with "one of the most significant scientific achievements of the 20th century".{{sfn|BBC Scotland|2014}} The discovery was recognised by the award of the 1974 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], but despite the fact that she was the first to observe the pulsars,{{sfn|Hargittai|2003|p=240}} Bell was excluded from the recipients of the prize.

The paper announcing the discovery of pulsars had five authors. Bell's thesis supervisor [[Antony Hewish]]{{sfn|Hewish|Bell|Pilkington|Scott|1968|p=709}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Hewish|Bell|Cole|1968|p=126}} was listed first, Bell second. Hewish was awarded the Nobel Prize, along with the astronomer [[Martin Ryle]]. Many prominent astronomers criticised Bell's omission,{{sfn|Westly|2008}} including Sir [[Fred Hoyle]].{{sfn|Judson|2003}}{{sfn|McKie|2010}} In 1977, Bell Burnell played down this controversy, saying, "I believe it would demean Nobel Prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases, and I do not believe this is one of them."{{sfn|NYAS|1977}} The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, in its press release announcing the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics,{{sfn|Nobelprize.org|1974}} cited Ryle and Hewish for their pioneering work in radio-astrophysics, with particular mention of Ryle's work on [[aperture synthesis|aperture-synthesis technique]], and Hewish's decisive role in the discovery of pulsars.

Bell served as [[president of the Royal Astronomical Society]] from 2002 to 2004, as president of the [[Institute of Physics]] from October 2008 until October 2010, and as interim president of the Institute following the death of her successor, [[Marshall Stoneham]], in early 2011.

In 2018, she was awarded the [[Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics#Difference between Breakthrough Prize and Special Breakthrough Prize|Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics]]. She gave the whole of the £2.3m prize money to help women, ethnic minority, and refugee students become physics researchers.{{sfn|Sample|2018}}{{sfn|Kaplan|Farzan|2018}}

== Education and early life ==
[[File:Susan Jocelyn Bell (Burnell), 1967.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jocelyn Bell, June 1967]]
Jocelyn Bell was born in [[Lurgan]], [[Northern Ireland]], to M. Allison and G. Philip Bell.{{sfn|''Lurgan Mail''|2007}}{{sfn|Who's Who|2017}} Her father was an architect who had helped design the [[Armagh Planetarium]],{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=2–3}} and during visits she was encouraged by the staff to pursue astronomy professionally.{{sfn|Bertsch McGrayne|1998}} Young Jocelyn also discovered her father's books on [[astronomy]].

She grew up in Lurgan and attended the Preparatory Department{{efn|The Preparatory Department of [[Lurgan College]] closed in 2004,{{sfn|Lurgan College history}} the college becoming a selective grammar school for ages 14–19.}} of [[Lurgan College]] from 1948 to 1956,{{sfn|''Lurgan Mail''|2007}} where she, like the other girls, was not permitted to study science until her parents (and others) protested against the school's policy. Previously, the girls' curriculum had included such subjects as cooking and [[cross-stitching]] rather than science.{{sfn|Kaufman|2016}}

She failed the [[eleven-plus exam]] and her parents sent her to [[The Mount School, York|The Mount School]],{{sfn|Who's Who|2017}} a [[Quaker]] girls' boarding school in [[York]], England. There she was favourably impressed by her physics teacher, Mr Tillott, and stated: {{quote|You do not have to learn lots and lots&amp;nbsp;... of facts; you just learn a few key things, and&amp;nbsp;... then you can apply and build and develop from those&amp;nbsp;... He was a really good teacher and showed me, actually, how easy physics was.{{sfn|Interview at NRAO|1995}}}}

Bell Burnell was the subject of the first part of the [[BBC Four]] three-part series ''[[Beautiful Minds (TV programme)|Beautiful Minds]]'', directed by Jacqui Farnham.{{sfn|BBC|2011b}}

== Career and research ==
[[File:Chandra-crab.jpg|thumb|right|Composite Optical/X-ray image of the [[Crab Nebula]], showing [[synchrotron emission]] in the surrounding [[pulsar wind nebula]], powered by injection of magnetic fields and particles from the central pulsar]]
She graduated from the [[University of Glasgow]] with a Bachelor of Science degree in Natural Philosophy (physics), with honours, in 1965 and obtained a PhD degree from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1969. At Cambridge, she attended [[Murray Edwards College|New Hall, Cambridge]], and worked with Hewish and others to construct{{efn|"... upon entering the faculty, each student was issued a set of tools: a pair of pliers, a pair of long-nose pliers, a wire cutter, and a screwdriver...", said during a public lecture in Montreal during the 40 Years of Pulsars conference, 14 August 2007}} the [[Interplanetary Scintillation Array]] to study [[quasar]]s, which had recently been discovered.{{efn|Interplanetary scintillation allows compact sources to be distinguished from extended ones.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}}}

In July 1967, she detected a bit of "scruff" on her [[chart recorder|chart-recorder]] papers that tracked across the sky with the stars.{{sfn|The Open University}} She established that the signal was pulsing with great regularity, at a rate of about one pulse every one and a third seconds. Temporarily dubbed "Little Green Man 1" (LGM-1) the source (now known as [[PSR B1919+21]]) was identified after several years as a rapidly rotating [[neutron star]]. This was later documented by the BBC ''[[Horizon (UK TV series)|Horizon]]'' series.{{sfn|BBC|2010}}

She worked at the [[University of Southampton]] between 1968 and 1973, [[University College London]] from 1974 to 82 and the [[Royal Observatory, Edinburgh|Royal Observatory]], Edinburgh (1982–91). From 1973 to 1987 she was a tutor, consultant, examiner, and lecturer for the [[Open University]].{{sfn|Jocelyn Bell Burnell profile}} In 1986, she became the project manager for the [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]] on [[Mauna Kea]], Hawaii.{{sfn|''Notable Women''|1997}} She was Professor of Physics at the Open University from 1991 to 2001. She was also a visiting professor at [[Princeton University]] in the United States and Dean of Science at the [[University of Bath]] (2001–04),{{sfn|University of Bath|2004}} and President of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] between 2002 and 2004.

Bell Burnell is currently Visiting Professor of Astrophysics at the [[University of Oxford]], and a Fellow of [[Mansfield College]].{{sfn|UoO|2007}} She was President of the [[Institute of Physics]] between 2008 and 2010.{{sfn|Institute of Physics: Council}} In February 2018 she was appointed [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Dundee]].{{sfn|Univ of Dundee|2018}} In 2018, Bell Burnell visited [[Parkes, NSW]], to deliver the keynote [[John Bolton (astronomer)|John Bolton]] lecture at the CWAS AstroFest event.{{sfn|Warren|Thackray|2018}}{{sfn|CWAS|2018}}

In 2018, she was awarded the [[Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics#Difference between Breakthrough Prize and Special Breakthrough Prize|Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics]], worth three million dollars (£2.3&amp;nbsp;million), for her discovery of radio pulsars.{{sfn|Merali|2018}} The Special Prize, in contrast to the regular annual prize, is not restricted to recent discoveries.{{sfn|Breakthrough Prize|2018}} She donated all of the money "to fund women, under-represented ethnic minority and refugee students to become physics researchers",{{sfn|Ghosh|2018}} the funds to be administered by the [[Institute of Physics]].{{sfn|Kaplan|Farzan|2018}}

=== Nobel Prize controversy ===
That Bell did not receive recognition in the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics has been [[Nobel Prize controversies|a point of controversy]] ever since. She helped build the [[Interplanetary Scintillation Array]] over two years{{sfn|''The Life Scientific''|2011}} and initially noticed the anomaly, sometimes reviewing as much as {{Convert|96|ft}} of paper data per night. Bell later claimed that she had to be persistent in reporting the anomaly in the face of scepticism from Hewish, who was initially insistent that it was due to interference and man-made. She spoke of meetings held by Hewish and Ryle to which she was not invited.{{sfn|BBC|2011a}} In 1977, she commented on the issue:
{{quote|First, demarcation disputes between supervisor and student are always difficult, probably impossible to resolve. Secondly, it is the supervisor who has the final responsibility for the success or failure of the project. We hear of cases where a supervisor blames his student for a failure, but we know that it is largely the fault of the supervisor. It seems only fair to me that he should benefit from the successes, too. Thirdly, I believe it would demean Nobel Prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases, and I do not believe this is one of them. Finally, I am not myself upset about it – after all, I am in good company, am I not!{{sfn|NYAS|1977}}}}

'''Sirdar Kapur Singh, ICS''' (2 March 1909 – 13 August 1986) was an eminent [[Sikh]] philosopher, theologian, politician-parliamentarian, and a prolific writer of the twentieth century.  As a distinguished linguist he had a mastery over English, [[Gurmukhi]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic]] and [[Sanskrit]].

== Birth and education ==
Kapur Singh was born in a farming family at village Chakk in the district of [[Ludhiana]]. His father's name was Didar Singh. He post-graduated from Government College, Lahore.  Later he completed studies in Moral Sciences from Cambridge University.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Harbans Singh&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career in bureaucracy and dismissal ==
Returning from UK, Kapur Singh joined the [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS). After serving at a number of administrative posts under the [[British raj]], he was summarily dismissed from service by Chandu Lal Trivedi, the governor of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], shortly after [[Partition of India|Indian Independence]], while he was serving as the deputy commissioner of [[Kangra district]].&lt;ref name="sakhi" /&gt;

Kapur Singh was incensed at a circular issued by the government that targeted his community. Kapur Singh filed a protest and made the circular public and invited the wrath of Chandu Lal Divedi, the governor of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. The charges leveled against him were of corruption and [[insubordination]].

'''Kenneth Duva Burke''' (May 5, 1897 – November 19, 1993) was an American [[literary theory|literary theorist]], as well as poet, essayist, and novelist, who wrote on 20th-century [[philosophy]], [[aesthetics]], [[criticism]], and [[rhetoric|rhetorical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Toye, ''Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As a literary theorist, Burke was best known for his analyses based on the nature of knowledge. Furthermore, he was one of the first individuals to stray away from more traditional [[rhetoric]] and view literature as "[[symbol|symbolic action]]."

Burke was unorthodox, concerning himself not only with literary texts, but with the elements of the text that interacted with the audience: social, historical, political background, author biography, etc.&lt;ref&gt;"Kenneth Burke." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/85395/Kenneth-Burke] Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his career, Burke has been praised by ''The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'' as "one of the most unorthodox, challenging, and theoretically sophisticated American-born literary critics of the twentieth century." His work continues to be discussed by rhetoricians and philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;"Kenneth Burke." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/85395/Kenneth-Burke] Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal history==
He was born on May 5 in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], and graduated from [[Peabody High School (Pennsylvania)|Peabody High School]], where his friend [[Malcolm Cowley]] was also a student. While he attended [[Ohio State University]] to pursue courses in French, German, Greek, and Latin, he later dropped out to move closer to New York City where he enrolled at Columbia University. During his time there, he was a member of the [[Boar's Head Society]].&lt;ref name=wolin&gt;

Edited by Bekah Shaia Dickstein, 2004. http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Burke__Kenneth.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greenwich Village]] he kept company with [[avant-garde]] writers such as [[Hart Crane]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Gorham Munson]], and later [[Allen Tate]].&lt;ref&gt;Selzer, Jack. ''Kenneth Burke in Greenwich Village: Conversing with the Moderns, 1915–1931''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Raised by a Christian Science mother, Burke later became an avowed agnostic.

In 1919, he married Lily Mary Batterham, with whom he had three daughters: the late feminist, Marxist  anthropologist [[Eleanor Leacock]] (1922–1987); musician (Jeanne) Elspeth Chapin Hart (b. 1920); and writer and poet France Burke (b. ~1925). He would later marry her sister Elizabeth Batterham in 1933 and have two sons, Michael and Anthony. Burke served as the editor of the modernist literary magazine ''[[The Dial]]'' in 1923, and as its music critic from 1927-1929. Kenneth himself was an avid player of the piano. He received the [[The Dial#The Dial Award|Dial Award]] in 1928 for distinguished service to American literature. He was the music critic of ''[[The Nation]]'' from 1934–1936, and was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth Century Authors: A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature'', edited by [[Stanley Kunitz|Stanley J. Kunitz]] and Howard Haycraft, New York, The H. W. Wilson Company, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work on criticism was a driving force for placing him back into the university spotlight.  As a result, he was able to teach and lecture at various colleges, including [[Bennington College]], while continuing his literary work. Many of Kenneth Burke's personal papers and correspondence are housed at [[Pennsylvania State University]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20110807002118/http://www.libraries.psu.edu//psul/speccolls/rbm/burke.html Special Collections Library]. However, despite his stint lecturing at Universities, Burke was an [[autodidact]] and a self-taught scholar.&lt;ref&gt;"Letters from Kenneth Burke to William H. Rueckert, 1959-198", edited by William H. Rueckert, Indiana, Parlor Press LLC, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life, his New Jersey farm was a popular summer retreat for his extended family, as reported by his grandson [[Harry Chapin]], a contemporary popular song artist. He died of heart failure at his home in [[Andover, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADE099E1B49D55&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "KENNETH BURKE, 96 PHILOSOPHER, WRITER ON LANGUAGE"], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', November 22, 1993. Accessed July 16, 2008. "Kenneth Burke, a philosopher who was influential in American literary circles, has died. He was 96. Mr. Burke died Friday of heart failure at his home in Andover, N.J."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persuasions and influences==
Burke, like many twentieth century theorists and critics, was heavily influenced by the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. He was a lifelong interpreter of [[Shakespeare]] and was also significantly influenced by [[Thorstein Veblen]]. He resisted being pigeonholed as a follower of any philosophical or political school of thought, and had a notable and very public break with the [[Marxism|Marxists]] who dominated the literary criticism set in the 1930s.

Burke corresponded with a number of literary critics, thinkers, and writers over the years, including [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Ralph Ellison]], [[Albert Murray (writer)|Albert Murray]], [[Katherine Anne Porter]], [[Jean Toomer]], [[Hart Crane]], and [[Marianne Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.psu.edu/content/dam/psul/up/speccolls/documents/Burke-1_Correspondents.pdf "List of Correspondents in Kenneth Burke Papers"], Kenneth Burke Papers, Special Collections Library, Pennsylvania State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Later thinkers who have acknowledged Burke's influence include [[Harold Bloom]], [[Stanley Cavell]], [[J. Hillis Miller]], [[Susan Sontag]] (his student at the University of Chicago), [[Erving Goffman]],&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, J. N. (1978). ''Social Exchange, Dramaturgy and Ethnomethodology: Toward a Paradigmatic Synthesis.'' New York: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Hartman]], [[Edward Said]], [[René Girard]], [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Michael Calvin McGee]], [[Dell Hymes]] and [[Clifford Geertz]]. Burke was one of the first prominent American critics to appreciate and articulate the importance of Thomas Mann and André Gide; Burke produced the first English translation of "Death in Venice", which first appeared in ''The Dial'' in 1924. It is now considered to be much more faithful and explicit than H. T. Lowe-Porter's more famous 1930 translation.

Burke's political engagement is evident—''A Grammar of Motives'' takes as its epigraph, ''ad bellum purificandum'' (toward the purification of war).

American literary critic Harold Bloom singled out Burke's ''Counterstatement'' and ''A Rhetoric of Motives'' for inclusion in his "Western Canon".

Beyond his contemporary influences, Burke took [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] teachings into account while developing his theories on rhetoric. A significant source of his ideas is Aristotle's ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''. Drawing from this work, Burke oriented his writing about language specifically to its social context. Similarly, he studied language as involving more than logical discourse and grammatical structure because he recognized that the social context of language cannot be reduced to principles of pure reason.

Burke draws a line between a Platonic and a more contemporary view of rhetoric, described as "old rhetoric" and "new rhetoric" respectively. The former is defined by persuasion by any means, while the latter is concerned with "[[Identification in Burkean rhetoric|identification]]."  In Burke's use of the word identification he is describing the process by which the speaker associates herself/himself with certain groups, such as a target audience.  
His idea of "identification" is similar to ethos of classical rhetoric, but it also explains the use of logos and pathos in an effort to create a lasting impression on the auditors. This theory differs from ethos most significantly in Burke's conception of artistic communication that he believes is defined by eloquence, which is "simply the end of art and therefore its essence."  The use of rhetoric conveys aesthetic and social competence which is why a text can rarely be reduced to purely scientific or political implications, according to Burke. Rhetoric forms our social identity by a series of events usually based on linguistics, but more generally by the use of any symbolic figures.  He uses the metaphor of a drama to articulate this point, where interdependent characters speak and communicate with each other while allowing the others to do the same.  Also, Burke describes identification as a function of persuasive appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Gregory. [https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/2207/27%281%29+50-59.pdf?sequence=1 "Kenneth Burke's Rhetorical Theory within the Construction of the Enthnography of Speaking."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke defined [[rhetoric]] as the "use of words by human agents to form attitudes or to induce actions in other human agents." His definition builds on the preexisting ideas of how people understand the meaning of rhetoric. Burke describes rhetoric as using words to move people or encourage action.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Furthermore, he described rhetoric as being almost synonymous with persuasion (A Rhetoric of Motives, 1950). Burke argued that rhetoric works to bring about change in people. This change can be evident through attitude, motives or intentions as Burke stated but it can also be physical. Calling for help is an act of rhetoric. Rhetoric is symbolic action that calls people to physical action. Ultimately, rhetoric and persuasion become interchangeable words according to Burke. Other scholars have similar definitions of rhetoric. [[Aristotle]] argued that rhetoric was a tool for persuading people (but also for gaining information). He stated that rhetoric had the power to persuade people if the speaker knew how. One way in which Aristotle formed his arguments was through [[syllogism]]. Another example of how rhetoric was used to persuade was deliberate discourse. Here, politicians and lawyers used speech to pass or reject policies. [[Sally Miller Gearhart|Sally Gearhart]] states that rhetoric uses persuasion to induce change. Although she argues persuasion is violent and harmful, she uses it as a tool herself to bring about change.

==Philosophy==
The political and social power of ''symbols'' was central to Burke's scholarship throughout his career. He felt that through understanding "what is involved when we say what people are doing and why they are doing it", we could gain insight into the cognitive basis for our perception of the world. For Burke, the way in which we decide to narrate gives importance to specific qualities over others. He believed that this could tell us a great deal about how we see the world.

===Dramatism===
Burke called the social and political rhetorical analysis "[[dramatism]]" and believed that such an approach to language analysis and language usage could help us understand the basis of conflict, the virtues and dangers of cooperation, and the opportunities of identification and consubstantiality.

Burke defined the rhetorical function of language as "a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols."  His [[definition of humanity]] states that "man" is "the symbol using, making, and mis-using animal, inventor of the negative, separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of hierarchy, and rotten with perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "Definition of Man." ''The Hudson Review'' 16 4 (1963/1964): 491-514&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coe, Richard M. "Defining Rhetoric—and Us: A Meditation on Burke's Definition." ''Composition Theory for the Postmodern Classroom''. Eds. Olson, Gary A. and Sidney I. Dobrin. Albany: SUNY Press, 1994. 332-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Burke, some of the most significant problems in human behavior resulted from instances of symbols using human beings rather than human beings using symbols.

Burke proposed that when we attribute motives to others, we tend to rely on ratios between five elements: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. This has become known as the [[dramatistic pentad]].  The pentad is grounded in his dramatistic method, which considers human communication as a form of action. Dramatism "invites one to consider the matter of motives in a perspective that, being developed from the analysis of drama, treats language and thought primarily as modes of action" (Grammar of Motives xxii).  Burke pursued literary criticism not as a formalistic enterprise but rather as an enterprise with significant [[sociological criticism|sociological]] impact; he saw literature as "equipment for living," offering folk wisdom and common sense to people and thus guiding the way they lived their lives.

===Rebirth Cycle===
Through the use of dramatism, one can ultimately utilize Burke's Rebirth Cycle.  This cycle encompasses three distinct phases, which include: Guilt/Pollution, Purification, and Redemption.  Burke introduced the phases and their functionality through the use of a poem.  The poem follows, 
Here are the steps
In the Iron Law of History That welds Order and Sacrifice 
Order leads to Guilt
(For who can keep commandments!) Guilt needs Redemption
(for who would not be cleaned!) Redemption needs Redeemer (which is to say, a Victim!) 
Order
Through Guilt
To Victimage
(hence: Cult of the Kill)..." (p. 4-5) &lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. The Rhetoric of Religion. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Burke's poem provides a basis of for the interactions of the three phases. Order's introduction into the life of human enables the creation of guilt. In order to alleviate the results produced by the creation of Guilt, redemption is necessitated.  Through the abstraction of redemption, Burke leads to the completion of the cycle.

Pollution initially constitutes actions taken by an individual that result in the creation of Guilt.  The creation of Guilt occurs upon the rejection of a hierarchy. Challenges to relationships, changes in power, and appropriateness of behaviors to change are each contributing factors toward the formation of Guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Rybacki, Karyn &amp; Rybacki, Donald. Communication Criticism: Approaches and Genres. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is appropriate to draw parallels between the creation of Guilt, and the concept of original sin. Original sin constitutes "... an offense that cannot be avoided or a condition in which all people share".&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja K., Foss, Karen A., and Trapp, Robert. Contemporary Perspectives on Rhetoric. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press, Inc., 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt represents the initial action that strips a situation of its perceived purity. The establishment of Guilt necessarily leads to the need to undergo purification to cleanse the individual affected by its recognition.  Purification is thus accomplished through two forms of "ritual purification." Mortification and victimage represent the available avenues of purification

Stratification within society created by hierarchies allows for marginalization within societies.  Marginalization thus is a leading factor in the creation of Guilt, and leads to the need for mortification. Burke stated, "In an emphatic way, mortification is the exercising of oneself in 'virtue'; it is a systematic way of saying no to Disorder, or obediently saying yes to Order".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. The Rhetoric of Religion. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortification allows an individual's self-sacrifice which consequently enables them to rid themselves of impurities. Purification will only be reached, if it is equal to an individual's degree of guilt.  If mortification cannot be reached, individuals will ultimately be forced to project, "his conflict upon a scapegoat, by 'passing the buck,' by seeking a sacrificial vessel upon which he can vent, as from without, a turmoil that is actually within".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kennth. A Rhetoric of Motives. Berkley: University of California Press, 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrificial vessels allow for the extermination of an individual's Guilt while enabling them to remain virtuous. 
Victimage is the second form of ritual purification. Burke highlights society's need to rectify division within its ranks. He contended that "People so dislike the idea of division, their dislike can easily be turned against the man or group who would so much as name it, let alone proposing to act upon it".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth"The Rhetoric of Hitler's "Battle."" Readings in Rhetorical Criticism. Ed. Carl R. Burgchardt. State College: STRATA Publishing, Inc. 2010. 238-253.&lt;/ref&gt; Victimage allows for the creation of a scapegoat that serves as a depository of impurities in order to protect against entities that are alien to a particular society. The scapegoat takes on the sins of the impure, thus allowing redemption for the Guilty party.  Unfortunately, through the course of these actions the scape goat is harnessed with the sins of the Guilty.

Redemption is reached through one of two options. Tragic redemption revolves around the idea that guilt combines with the principles of perfection and substitution in order that victimage can be utilized. This can be viewed as the "guilty is removed from the rhetorical community through either scapegoating or mortification".&lt;ref&gt;Borchers, Timothy. Rhetorical Theory: An Introduction, Long Grove: Waveland Press, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Comic enlightenment is the second form of redemption.  This option allows the sins of the guilty to be adopted by Society as a whole, ultimately making Society guilty by association.

===Terministic screen===
Another key concept for Burke is the [[Terministic screens|Terministic screen]]—a ''set'' of symbols that becomes a kind of ''screen'' or grid of intelligibility through which the world makes sense to us.  Here Burke offers rhetorical theorists and critics a way of understanding the relationship between language and ideology.  Language, Burke thought, doesn't simply "reflect" reality; it also helps ''select'' reality as well as ''deflect'' reality. In ''Language as Symbolic Action'' (1966), he writes, "Even if any given terminology is a ''reflection'' of reality, by its very nature as a terminology it must be a ''selection'' of reality; and to this extent must function also as a ''deflection'' of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bizzell | last2 = Herzberg | title = The Rhetorical Tradition | edition = 2 | editors = Patricia Bizzell and Bruce Herzberg | pages = 1340–47 | accessdate = 2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Burke describes terministic screens as reflections of reality—we see these symbols as things that direct our attention to the topic at hand. For example, photos of the same object with different filters each direct the viewer's attention differently, much like how different subjects in academia grab the attention differently.  Burke states, "We must use terministic screens, since we can't say anything without the use of terms; whatever terms we use, they necessarily constitute a corresponding kind of screen; and any such screen necessarily directs the attention to one field rather than another." Burke drew not only from the works of Shakespeare and Sophocles, but from films and radio that were important to pop culture, because they were teeming with "symbolic and rhetorical ingredients." We as a people can be cued to accept the screen put in front of us, and mass culture such as TV and websites can be to blame for this. Media today has altered terministic screens, or as [[Richard Toye]] wrote in his book ''Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction'',  the "linguistic filters which cause us to see situations in particular fashions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Killian, Justin |author2=Larson, Sean |author3=Emanuelle Wessels |title=Language as Symbolic Action|url=http://www.comm.umn.edu/burke/LASA.html|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toye|first=Richard|title=Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-19-965136-8|pages=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal works==
In "Definition of Man", the first essay of his collection ''Language as Symbolic Action'' (1966), Burke defined humankind as a "symbol using animal" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). This [[definition of man]], he argued, means that "reality" has actually "been built up for us through nothing but our symbol system" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). Without our encyclopedias, atlases, and other assorted reference guides, we would know little about the world that lies beyond our immediate sensory experience. What we call "reality," Burke stated, is actually a "clutter of symbols about the past combined with whatever things we know mainly through maps, magazines, newspapers, and the like about the present . . . a construct of our symbol systems" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). College students wandering from class to class, from English literature to sociology to biology to calculus, encounter a new reality each time they enter a classroom; the courses listed in a university's catalogue "are in effect but so many different terminologies" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). It stands to reason then that people who consider themselves to be Christian, and who internalize that religion's symbol system, inhabit a reality that is different from the one of practicing Buddhists, or Jews, or Muslims. The same would hold true for people who believe in the tenets of free market capitalism or socialism, Freudian psychoanalysis or Jungian depth psychology, as well as mysticism or materialism. Each belief system has its own vocabulary to describe how the world works and what things mean, thus presenting its adherents with a specific reality (no page reference).

Burke's poetry appears in four collections: ''Book of Moments'' (1955), ''Collected Poems 1915–1967'' (1968), the posthumously published ''The Late Poems: 1968-1993 Attitudinizings Verse-wise, While Fending for One's Selph, and in a Style Somewhat Artificially Colloquial'' (2005), and ''Here &amp; Elsewhere: The Collected Fiction of Kenneth Burke'' (2005).

The '''Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts''' ({{lang-hy|Մեսրոպ Մաշտոցի անվան հին ձեռագրերի ինստիտուտ}} (''Mesrop Mashtots'i anvan hin dzeragreri institut'')), commonly referred to as the '''Matenadaran''' ({{lang-hy|{{Audio|Hy-մատենադարան.ogg|Մատենադարան|help=no}}}}), is a repository of ancient manuscripts, research institute and museum in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]. It holds one of the world's richest depositories of medieval [[manuscript]]s and [[book]]s which span a broad range of subjects, including theology, philosophy, history, medicine, literature, art history, and [[cosmography]] in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and many other languages.

==History==
The earliest mention of the term ''matenadaran'', which means "repository of manuscripts" in Armenian, was recorded in the writings of the fifth century A.D. historian [[Ghazar Parpetsi]], who noted the existence of such a repository at [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]], where [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Armenian language]] texts were kept.&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{hy icon}} Chookaszian, Babken L. and Levon Zoryan. ''«Մատենադարան»'' (Matenadaran). [[Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia]]. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1981, vol. 7, pp. 284-286.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, however, the sources remain largely silent on its status.

Thousands of manuscripts in Armenia were destroyed over the course of the tenth to fifteenth centuries during the Turkic-Mongol invasions. According to the medieval Armenian historian [[Stepanos Orbelian]], the [[Seljuk Turks]] were responsible for the burning of over 10,000 Armenian manuscripts in [[Baghaberd]] in 1170.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; In 1441, the ''matenadaran'' in [[Kozan, Adana|Sis]], the capital of the former [[Cilician Kingdom of Armenia]], was moved to [[Etchmiadzin]] and other nearby monasteries.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; As a result of Armenia being a constant battleground between two major powers, the Matenadaran in Etchmiadzin was pillaged several times, the last of which took place in 1804.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; 

[[Eastern Armenia]]'s incorporation into the [[Russian Empire]] in the first third of the nineteenth century provided a more stable climate for the preservation of the remaining manuscripts. Thus, "a new era started for the Etchmiadzin Matenadaran. The Armenian cultural workers procured new manuscripts and put them in order with more confidence."&lt;ref name="HM"&gt;Anon. "[http://www.matenadaran.am/en/history/index.html The History of Matenadaran]." Virtual Matenadaran. Accessed April 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in 1828 the curators of the Matenadaran catalogued a collection of only 1,809 manuscripts, in 1914 the collection had increased to 4,660 manuscripts.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; At the outbreak of World War I, all the manuscripts were sent to [[Moscow]] for safekeeping and were kept there for the duration of the war.

==Founding==
[[File:Interior of Matenadaran.jpg|upright|thumb|A row of steps near the entrance leading to the upper floor of the Matenadaran]] 
[[File:Matenadaran (29).JPG|thumb|left|The new section of the Matenadaran building opened in 2011, and is intended to serve as a research institute (architect: [[Arthur Meschian]])]]
On December 17, 1920, the collection of books and manuscripts held at the headquarters of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] at Etchmiatzin was confiscated by the [[Bolsheviks]]. In a decree issued by [[Aleksandr Myasnikyan|Alexander Miasnikyan]] on March 6, 1922, the manuscripts that had been sent to Moscow were ordered to be returned to Armenia. Combined with other collections, they were declared a property of the state on December 17, 1929. In 1939, the collection was moved to [[Yerevan]] and stored at the Alexander Miasnikyan State Library. Finally, on March 3, 1959, the Council of Ministers of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic voted in support of the establishment of a repository to maintain and house the manuscripts in a new building, which was named after Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the creator of the [[Armenian alphabet]], in 1962. In 1954, Armenian [[academician]] Levon Khachikyan was appointed as the Matenadaran's director.

The Matenadaran was designed by architect Mark Grigoryan. Located to the north of the city's center, at the foot of a small hill, construction began in 1945 and completed in 1957. The exterior was constructed of basalt but parts of the interior were made of other materials such as marble.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; In the 1960s, the statues of historical Armenian scholars, [[Toros Roslin]], [[Grigor Tatevatsi]], [[Anania Shirakatsi]], [[Movses Khorenatsi]], [[Mkhitar Gosh]] and [[Frik]], were erected on the left and right wings of the building's exterior. The statues of Mesrop Mashots and his pupil are located below the terrace where the main building stands.

On May 14, 2009, upon the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Matenadaran, Armenian state and religious officials conducted the groundbreaking ceremony of the construction of a research institute being built adjacent to the Matenadaran.&lt;ref&gt;Hakobyan, Sona. "[http://armradio.am/news/?part=soc&amp;id=14976 Groundbreaking ceremony for a new building of Matenadaran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531152736/http://armradio.am/news/?part=soc&amp;id=14976 |date=2011-05-31 }}." Radiolur. May 14, 2009. Accessed May 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction was finished in 2011 by architect Arthur Meschian, who had started working on the design of the new building at the end of the 1980s.

==Objectives==
The Matenadaran's main objectives are first and foremost the 1) preservation, restoration, and reproduction of the manuscripts; 2) their procurement; 3) the organization and cataloging of Armenian manuscripts; and 4) the distribution and publication of particularly historically significant Armenian manuscripts in languages asides from Armenian.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; In 1941, it began publishing its official periodical, ''Banber Matenadarani'' (''The Matenadaran Herald'') which are accompanied with Russian and French abstracts.

==Matenadaran collection==
[[Image:Armenian annunciation.jpg|thumb|200px|An illumination (MS No. 197) from the Matenadaran Gospel (1287).]]
The Matenadaran is in possession of a collection of nearly 17,000 manuscripts and 30,000 other documents which cover a wide array of subjects such as [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[historiography]] and [[history]], [[geography]], [[grammar]], [[art]] and [[art history]], [[medicine]] and [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, Lawrence.

[[UNESCO]]. № 5, May 24, 2007. Accessed May 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decades of Soviet rule, its collection was largely drawn from manuscripts stored in ecclesiastical structures in the historic regions of [[Vaspurakan]] (eastern Turkey, Van region) and [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] (Northeastern Turkey), in schools, monasteries and churches in Armenia and the rest of the Soviet Union (such as those located in [[New Nakhichevan]] and the Nersisyan Seminary in [[Tbilisi]]), the [[Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages]] in Moscow, from the Armenian Apostolic Church's [[primate (bishop)|Primacy]] in [[Tabriz]], the village of Darashamb in [[Iran]], as well as the personal collections given by private donors.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; In addition to the Matenadaran's Armenian manuscripts, there is a vast collection of historical documents numbering over 2,000 in languages such as [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hebrew]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;Anon.

===Armenian===
The Armenian collection at the Matenadaran is abundantly rich in manuscripts dealing in all fields of the humanities, but particularly [[historiography]] and theology/philosophy. The writings of classical and medieval historians [[Movses Khorenatsi]], [[Yeghishe]] and [[Aristakes Lastivertsi]] are preserved here, as are the legal, philosophical and theological writings of other notable Armenian figures. The preserved writings of [[Grigor Narekatsi]] and [[Nerses Shnorhali]] at the Matenadaran form the cornerstone of medieval Armenian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Anon. "[http://www.matenadaran.am/en/heritage/literature.html The Heritage: Literature]." Virtual Matenadaran. Accessed May 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenian collection is also composed of 2,500 [[Armenian illuminated manuscript]]s, which include such prominent examples as the [[Echmiadzin Gospel]] (989) and the [[Mugni Gospels]] (1060). Another prominent manuscript in the collection is the Homilies of Mush, written in the years 1200-1202 A.D. in the Avak Monastery in Yerzenka (modern-day [[Erzincan|Erzincan, Turkey]]), which measures 55.3&amp;nbsp;cm by 70.5&amp;nbsp;cm (21.8 inches by 27.8 inches), weighs 27.5&amp;nbsp;kg (60.6&amp;nbsp;lbs.), and contains 603 [[calf skin]] parchment pages.&lt;ref&gt;

Since it was found to be too heavy to be carried, it was split into two: one half was wrapped in a cloth and buried, while the second half was taken to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. A couple of years later, a [[Polish people|Polish]] officer found the first half and sold it to an officer in [[Baku]]. It was eventually brought to Armenia and the two halves were finally reunited.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Olympe de Gouges''' ({{IPA-fr|olɛ̃p də ɡuʒ|lang|Fr-Olympe de Gouges.ogg}}; 7 May 1748 – 3 November 1793), born '''Marie Gouze''', was a French playwright and political [[activism|activist]] whose [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]] writings reached a large audience.

She began her career as a [[playwright]] in the early 1780s. As political tension rose in France, Olympe de Gouges became increasingly politically engaged. She became an outspoken advocate against the slave trade in the [[French colonies]] in 1788. At the same time, she began writing political pamphlets. Today she is perhaps best known as an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' (1791), she challenged the practice of [[patriarchy|male authority]] and the notion of male-female inequality. She was [[capital punishment|executed]] by [[guillotine]] during the [[Reign of Terror]] (1793–1794) for attacking the regime of the Revolutionary government and for her association with the [[Girondist]]s.

Marie Gouze was born into a [[petite bourgeoisie|petit bourgeois]] family in 1748 in [[Montauban]], [[Quercy]] (in the present-day [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Tarn-et-Garonne]]), in southwestern France. She believed that she was the illegitimate daughter of [[Jean-Jacques Lefranc, Marquis de Pompignan|Jean-Jacques Lefranc]], Marquis de [[Pompignan, Tarn-et-Garonne|Pompignan]].&lt;ref name="Paul1989"&gt;{{cite web |first=Pauline |last=Paul |translator=Kai Artur Diers |title=I Foresaw it All: The Amazing Life and Oeuvre of Olympe de Gouges |work=[[Die Zeit]] |date=1989-06-02 |url=http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_5.2/paul.htm }} (also see [http://www.quercy.net/hommes/ogenglish.html Olympe de Gouges, a Daughter of Quercy on her Way to the Panthéon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041019110242/http://www.quercy.net/hommes/ogenglish.html |date=19 October 2004 }} on Quercy.net)&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother afforded her a bourgeois education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transatlantic Feminisms in the Age of Revolutions|authors=Lisa L. Moore, Joanna Brooks &amp; Caroline Wigginton|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199743483|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1765 aged 16 she was married against her will to Louis Aubry, a caterer. Gouges said in a [[autobiography|semi-autobiographical]] novel (''{{lang|fr|Mémoire de Madame de Valmont contre la famille de Flaucourt}}''), "I was married to a man I did not love and who was neither rich nor well-born. I was sacrificed for no reason that could make up for the repugnance I felt for this man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Noack |title=Olympe de Gouges, 1748–1793: Kurtisane und Kampferin für die Rechte der Frau |trans-title=Olympe de Gouges, 1748–1793: Courtesan and Activist for Women's Rights |publisher=Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag |year=1992 |language=German |page=31 |isbn=978-3-423-30319-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband died a year later, and in 1770 she moved to Paris with her son to live with her sister. She never married again, calling the institution of marriage "the tomb of trust and love".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transatlantic Feminisms in the Age of Revolutions|authors=Lisa L. Moore, Joanna Brooks &amp; Caroline Wigginton|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199743483|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris she started a relationship with the wealthy Jacques Biétrix de Rozières, but refused his marriage proposal. She remained close to Rozières throughout the [[French Revolution]]. With the support of Rozières she established a theatre company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transatlantic Feminisms in the Age of Revolutions|authors=Lisa L. Moore, Joanna Brooks &amp; Caroline Wigginton|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199743483|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gouges attended the artistic and [[philosophy|philosophical]] ''{{lang|fr|[[salon (gathering)|salons]]}}'' of Paris, where she met many writers, including [[Jean-François de La Harpe|La Harpe]], [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier|Mercier]], and [[Nicolas Chamfort|Chamfort]], as well as future politicians such as [[Jacques Pierre Brissot|Brissot]] and [[Marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet]]. She usually was invited to the ''{{lang|fr|salons}}'' of [[Madame de Montesson]] and the [[Fanny de Beauharnais|Comtesse de Beauharnais]], who also were playwrights. She also was associated with [[Freemasonry|Masonic Lodges]], among them the ''[[Les Neuf Sœurs|Loge des Neuf Sœurs]]'' that was created by her friend [[Michel de Cubières]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1788 she published ''Réflexions sur les hommes négres'', which demanded compassion for the plight of [[slaves]] in the [[French colonies]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cartesian Women: Versions and Subversions of Rational Discourse in the Old Regime |author=Erica Harth |publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1992|isbn=9780801499982|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Gouges there was a direct link between the autocratic monarchy in France and the institution of slavery, she argued that “Men everywhere are equal… Kings who are just do not want slaves; they know that they have submissive subjects.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cartesian Women: Versions and Subversions of Rational Discourse in the Old Regime |author=Erica Harth |publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1992|isbn=9780801499982|pages=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; She came to the public's attention with the play ''l'Esclavage des Noirs'', which was staged at the famous [[Comédie-Française]] in 1785. Her stance against the slavery in the French colonies made her the target of threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transatlantic Feminisms in the Age of Revolutions|authors=Lisa L. Moore, Joanna Brooks &amp; Caroline Wigginton|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199743483|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gouges was also attacked by those who thought that a woman's proper place was not in the theatre. The influential [[Abraham-Joseph Bénard]] remarked "Mme de Gouges is one of those women to whom one feels like giving razor blades as a present, who through their pretensions lose the charming qualities of their sex... Every woman author is in a false position, regardless of her talent". Gouges was defiant, she wrote "I'm determined to be a success, and I'll do it in spite of my enemies." The slave trade lobby had mounted a press campaign against her play and she eventually took legal action, forcing Comédie-Française to stage ''l'Esclavage des Noirs''. But the play closed after three performances; the lobby had paid hecklers to sabotage the performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexual Politics in the Enlightenment: Women Writers Read Rousseau|author=Mary Seidman  Trouille| publisher=SUNY Press| year=1997|isbn= 9780791434895|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A passionate advocate of [[human rights]], Gouges greeted the outbreak of the Revolution with hope and joy, but soon became disenchanted when ''{{lang|fr|égalité}}'' (equal rights) was not extended to women. In 1791 Gouges became part of the [[Society of the Friends of Truth]], also called the "Social Club," an association with the goal of equal political and legal rights for women. Members sometimes gathered at the home of the well-known women's rights advocate, [[Sophie de Condorcet]]. Here Gouges expressed, for the first time, her famous statement:{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A woman has the right to mount the scaffold. She must possess equally the right to mount the speaker's platform." {''The Declaration of the Rights of Women''}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1791, in response to the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'', she wrote the ''{{lang|fr|Déclaration des droits de la Femme et de la Citoyenne}}'' ("{{lang|en|[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]}}"). This was followed by her ''{{lang|fr|Contrat Social}}'' ("{{lang|en|Social Contract}}," named after a famous work of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]), proposing marriage based upon gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman, 1989 p.235&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790 and 1791, in the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] (present-day [[Haiti]]), free people of colour and African slaves revolted in response to the ideals expressed in the ''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Transatlantic Feminisms in the Age of Revolutions|authors= Lisa L. Moore, Joanna Brooks &amp; Caroline Wigginton|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2012|isbn= 9780199743483|pages= 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gouges did not approve of violent revolution, and published ''l'Esclavage des Noirs'' with a preface in 1792, arguing that the slaves and the free people who responded to the horrors of slavery with "barbaric and atrocious torture" in turn justified the behaviour of the tyrants. In Paris Gouges was accused{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} of having incited the insurrection in Saint-Domingue with the play. When it was staged again in December 1792 a riot erupted in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Tropics of Haiti: Race and the Literary History of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World, 1789-1865|author= Marlene L. Daut|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2015 |isbn= 9781781381847|pages= 248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gouges opposed the execution of [[Louis XVI of France]] (which took place on 21 January 1793), partly out of opposition to [[capital punishment]] and partly because she favored [[constitutional monarchy]]. This earned her the ire of many hard-line republicans, even into the next generation—such as the 19th-century historian [[Jules Michelet]], a fierce apologist for the Revolution, who wrote, "She allowed herself to act and write about more than one affair that her weak head did not understand."&lt;ref&gt;J. Michelet, ''{{lang|fr|La Révolution Française}}''.&lt;/ref&gt; Michelet opposed any political participation by women and thus disliked Gouges.&lt;ref&gt;See Charles Monselet, ''{{lang|fr|Les Oubliés et les Dédaignés}}'' [{{lang|en|The Forgotten and the Scorned}}]. See also Joan Scott in ''Rebel Daughters''.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1792, when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was about to be put on trial, she wrote to the National Assembly offering to defend him, causing outrage among many deputies. In her letter she argued that he had been duped–that he was guilty as a king, but innocent as a man, and that he should be exiled rather than executed.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p.311&lt;/ref&gt;

Gouges was associated with the [[Girondins|Gironde party]], who like her favoured a constitutional monarchy. After the execution of Louis XVI she became wary of [[Robespierre]]'s Montagnard fraction and in open letters criticised their violence and summary assassinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Transatlantic Feminisms in the Age of Revolutions|authors= Lisa L. Moore, Joanna Brooks &amp; Caroline Wigginton|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2012|isbn= 9780199743483|pages= 245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and execution===
[[File:Olympe de Gouges. Les Trois Urnes, ou Le salut de la patrie (Paris, 1793). British Library 443.a.3(7).jpg|thumb|right|''{{lang|fr|Les trois urnes}}'', the 1793 poster by Olympe de Gouges that led to her arrest and execution]]
[[File:Olympe gouges.jpg|thumb|right|The execution of Olympe de Gouges]]

As the Revolution progressed, she became more and more vehement in her writings. On 2 June 1793, the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] arrested prominent [[Girondins]], imprisoned them, and sent them to the guillotine in October. Finally, her poster ''{{lang|fr|Les trois urnes, ou le salut de la Patrie, par un voyageur aérien}}'' ("{{lang|en|The Three Urns, or the Salvation of the Fatherland, by an Aerial Traveller}}") of 1793, led to her arrest. That piece demanded a [[referendum |plebiscite]] for a choice among three potential forms of government: the first, a unitary [[republic]], the second, a [[federalism|federalist]] government, or the third, a constitutional monarchy.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}}

After her arrest, the commissioners searched her house for evidence. When they could not find any in her home, she voluntarily led them to the storehouse where she kept her papers. It was there that the commissioners found an unfinished play titled ''{{lang|fr|La France Sauvée ou le Tyran Détroné}}'' ("{{lang|en|France Preserved, or The Tyrant Dethroned}}"). In the first act (only the first act and a half remain), [[Marie-Antoinette]] is planning defence strategies to retain the crumbling monarchy and is confronted by revolutionary forces, including Gouges herself. The first act ends with Gouges reproving the queen for having seditious intentions and lecturing her about how she should lead her people. Both Gouges and her prosecutor used this play as evidence in her trial. The prosecutor claimed that Gouges' depictions of the queen threatened to stir up sympathy and support for the Royalists, whereas Gouges stated that the play showed that she had always been a supporter of the Revolution.&lt;ref name="vanpée47"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vanpée |first= Janie |title= Performing Justice: The Trials of Olympe de Gouges |journal= Theatre Journal |date= March 1999 |volume= 51 |issue= 1 |pages= 47–65 |jstor= 25068623 |doi= 10.1353/tj.1999.0018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She spent three months in jail without an [[lawyer| attorney]], trying to defend herself. The presiding judge denied Gouges her legal right to a lawyer on the grounds that she was more than capable of representing herself. It seems as though the judge based this argument on Gouges' tendency to represent herself in her writings.&lt;ref name="vanpée47"/&gt; Through her friends, she managed to publish two texts: ''{{lang|fr|Olympe de Gouges au tribunal révolutionnaire}}'' ("{{lang|en|Olympe de Gouges at the Revolutionary tribunal}}"), in which she related her interrogations; and her last work, ''{{lang|fr|Une patriote persécutée}}'' ("{{lang|en|A [female] patriot persecuted}}"), in which she condemned the Terror.&lt;ref name="vanpée47"/&gt;

Her son Pierre Aubry was suspended from his office as vice-general and head of battalion after her arrest.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Yesterday, at seven o'clock in the evening, a most extraordinary person called Olympe de Gouges who held the imposing title of woman of letters, was taken to the scaffold, while all of Paris, while admiring her beauty, knew that she didn't even know her alphabet.... She approached the scaffold with a calm and serene expression on her face, and forced the guillotine's furies, which had driven her to this place of torture, to admit that such courage and beauty had never been seen before.... That woman... had thrown herself in the Revolution, body and soul. But having quickly perceived how atrocious the system adopted by the Jacobins was, she chose to retrace her steps. She attempted to unmask the villains through the literary productions which she had printed and put up. They never forgave her, and she paid for her carelessness with her head."&lt;ref&gt;

Her execution was used as a warning to other politically active women. At the 15 November 1793 meeting of the Commune, [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]] cautioned a group of women wearing [[Symbolism in the French Revolution#Liberty cap|Phrygian bonnets]], reminding them: "the impudent Olympe de Gouges, who was the first woman to start up women's political clubs, who abandoned the cares of her home, to meddle in the affairs of the Republic, and whose head fell under avenging blade of the law". This posthumous characterisation of Gouges by the political establishment was misleading, as Gouges had no role in founding the [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]]. In her political writings Gouges had not called for women to abandon their homes, but she was cast by the politicians as an enemy of the natural order, and thus enemy of the ruling Jacobin party. Paradoxically, the two women who had started the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, [[Claire Lacombe]] and [[Pauline Léon]] were not executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Citoyennes: Women and the Ideal of Citizenship in Eighteenth-Century France

1793 has been described as a watershed for the construction of women's place in revolutionary France, and the deconstruction of the Girondins' [[Marianne]]. That year a number of women with a public role in politics were executed, including [[Madame Roland]] and [[Marie-Antoinette]]. The new ''Républicaine'' was the republican mother that nurtured the new citizen. While politically active women were executed the Convention banned all women's political associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Citoyennes: Women and the Ideal of Citizenship in Eighteenth-Century France|author=Annie Smart| publisher=University of Delaware|year=2011|isbn=9781611493559|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1793 marked the start of the [[Reign of Terror]] in post-revolutionary France, where thousands of people were executed. Across the Atlantic world observers of the French Revolution were shocked, but the ideals of [[liberté, égalité, fraternité]] had taken a life of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transatlantic Feminisms in the Age of Revolutions|authors=Lisa L.

The experience of French women during the revolution entered the collective consciousness. The anti-imperial [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] was whipped up by Anglo-Irish women such as [[Maria Edgeworth]], but the quest of Catholics for political rights was brutally suppressed by the British military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transatlantic Feminisms in the Age of Revolutions|authors=Lisa L.

On 6 March 2004, the junction of the Rues Béranger, Charlot, de Turenne, and de Franche-Comté in Paris was proclaimed the Place Olympe de Gouges. The square was inaugurated by the mayor of the [[3rd arrondissement of Paris|3rd arrondissement]], Pierre Aidenbaum, along with then first deputy mayor of Paris, [[Anne Hidalgo]]. The actress [[Véronique Genest]] read an excerpt from the ''Declaration of the Rights of Woman''. 2007 French presidential contender [[Ségolène Royal]] expressed the wish that Gouges' remains be moved to the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]].  However, her remains—like those of the other victims of the Reign of Terror—have been lost through burial in communal graves, so any reburial (like that of [[Marquis de Condorcet]]) would be only ceremonial.

==Plays and writings==
Born Marie Gouze she first adopted the name Olympe de Gouges for her early plays. As a woman from the province and of lowly birth she fashioned herself to fit in with the Paris establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Citoyennes: Women and the Ideal of Citizenship in Eighteenth-Century France
|author=Annie Smart|publisher=University of Delaware|year=2011|isbn=9781611493559|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gouges signed her public letters with ''citoyenne'', the feminised version of [[citizen]]. In pre-revolutionary France there were no citizens, an author was the subject of the king. But in revolutionary France there were only ''citoyen''. It was only in October 1792 that the Convention decreed the use of ''citoyenne'' to replace ''Madame'' and ''Mademoiselle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Citoyennes: Women and the Ideal of Citizenship in Eighteenth-Century France
|author=Annie Smart|publisher=University of Delaware|year=2011|isbn=9781611493559|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-revolutionary plays===
Gouges penned more than 30 plays, often with a socially critical theme. Among others she wrote plays on the [[slave trade]], [[divorce]], [[marriage]], [[debtors' prison]]s, [[children's rights]], and government work schemes for the [[unemployment|unemployed]]. As a playwright she charged into the contemporary political controversies and she was often in the vanguard. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Enlightenment|author=David Williams|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780521564908|pages=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her 1788 pamphlet ''Reflections on blacks'' and the play ''l'Esclavage des Noirs'' on the slave trade made her, alongside [[Marquis de Condorcet]], one of France's earliest public opponents of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Enlightenment|author=David Williams|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780521564908|pages=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final act of ''l'Esclavage des Noirs'' Gouges lets the French colonial master, not the slave, utter a prayer for freedom: “Let our common rejoicings be a happy portent of liberty”. She drew a parallel between colonial slavery and political oppression in France. One of the slave protagonist explains that the French must gain their own freedom, before they can deal with slavery. Gouges also openly attacked the notion that [[human rights]] were a reality in revolutionary France. The slave protagonist comments on the situation in France “The power of one Master alone is in the hands of a thousand Tyrants who trample the People under foot. The People will one day burst their chains and will claim all its rights under Natural law. It will teach the Tyrants just what a people united by long oppression and enlightened by sound philosophy can do.” While it was common in France to equate political oppression to slavery, this was an analogy and not an abolitionist sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cartesian Women: Versions and Subversions of Rational Discourse in the Old Regime |author=Erica Harth |publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1992|isbn=9780801499982|pages=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manifestos===
In November 1788 she published her first political brochure, a manifesto entitled ''Letter to the people, or project for a patriotic fund''. In early 1789 she published ''Patriotic remarks'' setting out her proposals for [[social security]], care for the elderly, institutions for homeless children, hostels for unemployed, and the introduction of a [[jury system]]. She also called upon women to "shake off the yoke of shameful slavery". The same year she wrote a series of pamphlets on a range of social concerns, such as illegitimate children. In these pamphlets she advanced the public debate on issues that would later be picked up by feminists, such as [[Flora Tristan]]. She continued to publish political essays between 1788 and 1791. Such as ''Cry of the wise man, by a woman'' in response to Louis XVI calling together the Estates-General''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Enlightenment

===Women's rights===
[[File:DDFC.jpg|thumb|First page of ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'']]
{{Main article|Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen}}
Gouges wrote her famous ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' shortly after the [[French Constitution of 1791]] was ratified by [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]], and dedicated it to his wife, [[Marie Antoinette|Queen Marie Antoinette]]. The French Constitution marked the birth of the short-lived [[constitutional monarchy]] and implemented a status based citizenship. Citizens were defined as men over 25, were "independent" and had paid the [[poll tax]]. These citizens had the right to vote. Furthermore active citizenship was two-tiered, with those who could vote and those who were fit for [[public office]]. Women were by definition not afforded any rights of active citizenship. Like men who could not pay the poll tax, children, domestic servants, rural day-laborers and slaves, Jews, actors and hangmen, women had no [[political rights]]. In transferring [[sovereignty]] to the nation the constitution dismantled the old regime, but Gouges argued that it did not go far enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Citoyennes: Women and the Ideal of Citizenship in Eighteenth-Century France
|author=Annie Smart|publisher=University of Delaware|year=2011|isbn=9781611493559|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gouges was not the only feminists who attempted to influence the political structures of late Enlightenment France. But like the writings of [[Etta Palm d'Aelders]], [[Theroigne de Mericourt]], [[Claire Lacombe]] and [[Marquis de Condorcet]], her arguments fell on deaf ears. At the end of the 18th century influential political actors such as [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Honoré Gabriel Riqueti]], [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] and [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]] were not convinced of the case for equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Enlightenment|author=David Williams|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780521564908|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letters and pamphlets===
[[File:Robespierre exécutant le bourreau.jpg|thumb|px100|Cartoon showing [[Robespierre]] guillotining the executioner after having guillotined everyone else in France.]]
In her early political letters Gouges made a point of being a woman, and that she spoke "as a woman". She addressed her public letters, published often as pamphlets, to statesmen such as [[Jacques Necker]], the [[Duke of Orléans]], or the queen [[Marie-Antoinette]]. Like other pamphlet writers in revolutionary France, she spoke from the margins and spoke of her experience as a citizen, with a desire to influence the ongoing public debate. In her letters she articulated the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and commented on how they may be put into practice, such as [[civic virtue]], [[universal rights]], [[natural rights]] and [[political rights]]. In language and practice this was a debate among men and about men. Republicans discussed civic virtue in terms of patriotic manliness (''la vertu mâle et répub-licaine''). Women were not granted political rights in revolutionary France, thus Gouges used her pamphlets to enter the public debate and she argued that the debate needed to include the female civic voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Citoyennes: Women and the Ideal of Citizenship in Eighteenth-Century France
|author=Annie Smart|publisher=University of Delaware|year=2011|isbn=9781611493559|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gouges signed her pamphlets with ''citoyenne''. It has been suggested that she adopted this notion from Rousseau's letter ''To the Republic of Geneva'', where he speaks directly to two types of Genevans: the "dear fellow citizens" or his "brothers", and the ''aimables et virtueeses Citoyenne'', that is the women citizens. In the public letter ''Remarques Patriotique'' from December 1788 Gouges justified why she is publishing her political thoughts, arguing that "This dream, strange though it may seem, will show the nation a truly civic heart, a spirit that is always concerned with the public good".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Citoyennes: Women and the Ideal of Citizenship in Eighteenth-Century France|author=Annie Smart|publisher=University of Delaware|year=2011|isbn=9781611493559|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the politics of revolutionary France changed and progressed Gouges failed to become an actor on the political stage, but in her letters offered advice to the political establishment. Her proposition for a political order remained largely unchanged. She expresses faith in the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] and in reference to the [[estates of the realm]], that the people of France (Third Estate) would be able to ensure harmony between the three estates, that is [[clergy]], [[nobility]] and the people. Despite this she expresses loyalty for the ministers [[Jacques Necker]] and [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]]. Gouges opposes [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]], but believed France should retain a [[constitutional monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Citoyennes: Women and the Ideal of Citizenship in Eighteenth-Century France| author=Annie Smart| publisher=University of Delaware|year=2011|isbn=9781611493559|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her open letter to Marie-Antoinette, Gouges declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I could never convince myself that a princess, raised in the midst of grandeur, had all the vices of baseness... Madame, may a nobler function characterize you, excite your ambition, and fix your attention. Only one whom chance had elevated to an eminent position can assume the task of lending weight to the progress of the Rights of Woman and of hastening its success. If you were less well informed, Madame, I might fear that your individual interests would outweigh those of your sex. You love glory; think, Madame, the greatest crimes immortalize one as much as the greatest virtues, but what a different fame in the annals of history! The one is ceaselessly taken as an example, and the other is eternally the execration of the human race."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transatlantic Feminisms in the Age of Revolutions|authors=Lisa L. Moore, Joanna Brooks &amp; Caroline Wigginton|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199743483|pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public letters, or pamphlets, were the primary means for the working class and women writers to engage in the public debate of revolutionary France. The intention was not to court the favour of the addressee, often a public figure. Frequently these pamphlets were intended to stir up public anger. They were widely circulated within and outside France. Gouges' contemporary [[Madame Roland]] of the Gironde party became notorious for her ''Letter to Louis XVI'' in 1792. In the same year Gouges penned ''Letter to Citizen Robespierre'', which [[Robespierre]] refused to answer. Gouges took to the street, and on behalf of the French people proclaimed "Let us plunge into the Seine! Thou hast need of a bath... thy death will claim things, and as for myself, the sacrifice of a pure life will disarm the heavens."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Romantic Correspondence: Women, Politics and the Fiction of Letters

'''Qene''' also known as '''Säm əna Wärq''' is a unique style of [[poetry]] from [[Ethiopia]] that is rich and deep in meaning, which demands critical thinking and analysis of the poetry to understand its meaning. It demands having not only a strong [[Amharic]], [[Tigrigna]], or [[Ge'ez language|Ge’ez]] vocabulary, but also familiarity with the culture from where the particular poem originates or the background against which it was written.&lt;ref name="kweschn"&gt;Yigzaw, Mariye.

==History==
[[File:Yared.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Yared]]]]
It is believed that  [[Yared|Saint Yared]] is the originator of Qəne.&lt;ref&gt;Yigzaw, Mariye. [http://www.qeneonnet.org/aboutqene.php?contentid=6 "Origin &amp; Source of Qəne Subject Matter"], ''[[QeneOnNet]]'', Addis Ababa, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of Saint Yared’s works are based on the Bible, thus it can be assumed that the Bible is the original source of Qəne composition. Some parts of the Bible such as the Psalms and the [[Song of Songs]] ([[Song of Songs|Song of Solomon]])  are written in poetry form. Some books of the Bible such as the Song of Songs and the teachings (sermons) of Jesus use a lot of metaphorical and allegorical language similar to the Säm əna Wärq mode of Qəne.  Saint Yared’s non-sparing use of the content and style of the Bible helped in making his compositions acceptable and popular. Some of his compositions are still used as prayers in their original form.

Although Saint Yared was the earliest composer of Qəne, he does not appear to have set the forms and meters for the genre. There are, in fact, several possible candidates deemed responsible. One possibility lies with Qəne scholars during the reign of  [[Eskender|Emperor Eskender]] (1478-1494) - Hawira, Menkera, Eskendera, Poeskenedera and Abidira. Another explanation – commonly referred to as the Wadla claim – attributes it to an early 15th-century scholar from Wadla named Yohannəs Geblawi. And then there is the Gonj claim - attributing the deed to a certain Täwanäy who flourished after the 15th century. Täwanäy is alleged to have learned his Qəne alongside Wäldä Mariam from a certain Eliab, who in turn learned it from alongside Lehib from Sämrä Ab, who in turn learned it from Yohannəs Geblawi.

Oral traditions also mention a certain Däqä Est’ifa as the scholar responsible for setting the meters for Qəne. Däqä Est’ifa is alleged to have acquired seven crafts from Greece - six having to do with magic, and the seventh Qəne - and returned to Ethiopia during the reign of [[Bä'edä Mariam|Emperor Bä'edä Mariam]] (1468-1478). He is then said to have taught the seventh craft to Prince Eskinder, Hawira, Menkera, Behur, and another Eskinder.

Däqä Est’ifa was quite popular at his former pupil Emperor Eskinder's court. One tradition claims he seduced the Emperor's wife and used one of his other crafts to vanish with her. Shortly thereafter, the Emperor set fire to the house Däqä Est’ifa and the Empress were hiding in. However, Däqä Est’ifa allegedly used another of his crafts to again disappear with his lover - and is said to still roam the island.

Yohannəs Geblawi, in contrast to Däqä Est’ifa's worldly crafts, is said to have acquired his Qəne during a spiritual meditation. Yohannəs was born at Geblon in Wadla (Lasta), and flourished at the time of [[Zara Yaqob|Emperor Zar'a Yacob]] (1434-1468). He and is said to have taught near Mount Tabor at Amara Saynt. Yohannes taught Qəne to the monk Aba Wäldä Gabriel, who in turn taught Sämrä  Kristos (Sämrä  Ab). Sämrä  Kristos (Sämrä  Ab) is said to have given [[Bä'edä Mariam|Emperor Bä'edä Mariam]] (1468-1478) Qəne lessons. He also taught Lehib and Eliab, the latter of whom taught Qəne to Täwanäy and Dədəq Wäldä Mariam.

Emperor Be'ede Mariam was so taken by the art of Qəne that he is said, on the advice of his teacher Sämrä  Kristos, to have gone into a week-long meditation to determine its origin. The answer was revealed to him on the festival of the changing of water unto wine (Qana ZeGelila), when he composed the following Qəne by divine inspiration,

        ድህረ ተሰብረ አጽንኦ ለሰብእናን ንሁክት
        ለብሃዊ ክርስቶስ በማየ ሃዲስ ጥምቀት፡፡

        After man's strength was shattered with grief,
        Christ the potter remade him with baptism.

As Be'ede Mariam's Qəne was composed during a gathering (Gubae) at the festival of [[Qana ZeGelila]], its form and meter has been known as Gubaʾe Qana. Sämrä  Kristos was then said to have composed a Zäʾämlakəye Qəne, after which the Emperor composed a Mibäzhu Qəne - the tradition claims.

One tradition also claims Täwanäy as Däqä Est’ifa's student. However, Däqä Est’ifa flourished during the reign of [[Eskender|Emperor Eskender]] - a period when third generation disciples of Yohannes Geblawi also taught. This casts into doubt the alleged role of Däqä Est’ifa as the originator of Qəne - as the line of Yohannes Geblawi would have precedence. Furthermore, the more than fifty years that span between Däqä Est’ifa and Täwanäy would make it hard to take the latter as a disciple. Moreover, other accounts put Täwanäy's time at the early 18th century.

Accordingly, along the Qəne line of Yohannes Geblawi, Sämrä Ab taught Lehib and Eliab. Eliab, in turn, taught Dədəq Wäldä Mariam and Täwanäy. Tradition also holds that due to unfavorable conditions caused by the wars of Ahmad Gragn (mid-16th century), Dədəq Wäldä Mariam and Täwanäy formed two separate Qəne styles - the Wadla and the Gonj schools, respectively.

Another interesting tradition holds that both disciples made the trip to Däq Island to further their knowledge. While Dədəq Wäldä Mariam chanced upon mystical teachers that helped him further his Qəne, Täwanäy had no such luck. Instead, he fell into the carnal snares of mystical women who thwarted his many attempts to escape. When he turned into an eagle and tried to fly away, they would turn into pebbles and stone him. When he turned into a worm to wiggle his way off the island, they would turn into chickens and peck at him. He finally managed to escape by turning into a flea and attaching himself to a sack of Gesho leaves destined for sale on the mainland! Perhaps the notion of Täwanäy as the disciple of Däqä Est’ifa stems from his legendary exploits at Däq  Island.

The same tradition claims that by the time Täwanäy escaped from Däq, he had only retained a fraction of what Eliab had taught him. Hence, the Gonj school of Qəne associated with Täwanäy stresses Qəne composition, but only fleetingly covers Ge'ez verb conjugation and syntax - whereas the Wadla school associated with Dədəq Wäldä Mariam teaches all these elements. The Wadla school was led by a succession of seven teachers - all with the title Dədəq - the last of whom was also named Dədəq Wäldä Mariam. He was succeeded by Ma'ibel Wäldä Hiwot (MeCha), who was then succeeded by Aleka Getahun (Gete Amoraw). The other disciple of Sämrä  Kristos, Lehib, taught Qəne to Zetre Wengel - who was succeeded by Zikri. He was in turn succeeded by Bekuru, and followed by Yonathan, who taught ZeNebiyat and QaleAwadi. Qale Awadi was succeeded by Aleka Maru of Amhara Sayint, who then taught Aqabe Se'at Kabte of Gonder.

Nevertheless, the multiplicity of Qəne lines of transmission does not imply multiple origins for Qəne. Saint Yared remains to be held as the founder of Qəne. Moreover, the many schools of Qəne can be seen in parallel to the various types of musical notations (such as Bethleheme, Qome, WenChere, AChabre, Wadle and Tegulete schools) that developed out of Saint Yared's Deggwa.

==Qəne and Poetry==

Traditionally any metrical verse with a rhyming scheme is defined as a poem, and since Qəne fulfills these requirements it can be considered to be a poem. However, while most poems have literal meaning, Qəne has to have a literal as well as a symbolic meaning by using the mode of Säm əna Wärq. One can say that all Qəne are poems, but not all poems can be Qəne. Qəne is different in that a profound idea can be veiled underneath an every-day idea through the mode of Säm əna Wärq (i.e. metaphorical representation). 
Since Qəne is sung as a hymn at a church service, one has to adhere to a standard metrical pattern.  The different types of Qəne have their own metrical pattern. The measure for the types of Qəne is not only numbers of verse but the syllabic metrical pattern as well. Thus, even though a poem uses a mode of Säm əna Wärq, unless it follows a certain metrical pattern it can’t be classified as a Qəne.

     እናንተ ወጣቶች ቀን አለ መስሏችሁ፣
     ከገጠሩ ኑሮ ከተማ ገብታችሁ፣
     መሠረት የሌላት ጎጆ መሥርታችሁ፣
     ዘማለች አደራ እንዳትወድቅባችሁ፡፡

     Oh! Youth thinking it is your time
     You left the countryside to settle in the city
     But your house is without foundation
     So be alert before the leaning house / harlot falls and/destroys you.

The poem has two Wärq phrases, the former is about the harlot and the latter warns about being destroyed by promiscuity. Even with such complex mode of Säm əna Wärq, the author called it a poem and not a Qəne. Thus we can see that Qəne has a much complex character than a poem.

==Qəne Language==
Most Qənes are composed in [[Ge'ez language|Ge’ez]], and most students at Qəne school start their education by learning the basics of the Gəʾəz language. Most Qənes are composed in Gəʾəz since Qəne rules regarding the Säm əna Wärq mode and metrical pattern are set up for the Gəʾəz language.&lt;ref name="kweschn" /&gt; But once we follow the right metrical pattern and rules of metaphor, one can compose Qəne in other languages. For Example in [[Amharic]], [[Oromo language|Afaan Oromo]], English …etc. This is evident in the advent of Guramayle Qəne (a blend of Gəʾəz and Amharic) and Amharic Qənes starting from the Gondarine Period (17th to 19th century)
Example of Qene blending Gəʾəz, Amharic and English:
3፡ Mäwädəs

     ኦ ብራዘርስ ውሉደ ጥምቀት፣
     እንተ በጉጓዔ ንትጋባ ውስተ ታዕካ ዘቅድስና፣
     መና ቃለወንጌል ቅዱስ እስመ በዛቲ አለና፣
     ፎር ዘ ሴክ ኦፍ ሳቲስፋይንግ ኢንተረስተ ውሉድ በጥዑም መና፣
     ወይነ ምስጋና ዘመላእከት ውስቴታ ተቀድሃ ከመ ከመ ያስተፍስህ የሰው ልቡና፣
     ኸርትሂ የገበሬ እርሻ እንዳያገኛት ሙስና፣
     ይዝነም ቃለ ወንጌል በፍቅር ወበትህተና፣
     እስመ ዝናመ ጽድቅ ተርዕየ በዘጳውሎስ ደመና፣
     ወደቂቀ ጳውሎስ አእዋም አህመልመሉ በዳኅና፡፡

     Oh Brothers, children of Baptism
     Let us hurry and enter the hall of Holiness
     Because inside there is Manna / words of the Gospel
     And to satisfy the interest of the children with tasty Manna
     The Angels’ gratitude / wine was poured to satisfy man’s conscience.
     And so that the farm/heart is not corrupted
     Let the words of the Gospel trickle with love and humility
     Because the rain of righteousness was seen in the clouds of Paul
     And the children of Paul / trees blossomed well. 
   
Meanings:
For the Säm, it is normal for people to rush towards a banquet hall where good food and drinks are being served. Comparatively, the BaläQəne(Qene Poet) advises his brothers (members of the MahəBärä Qədusan(MQ) organization) to rush towards the gates of the church where one can find food for the soul – words from the gospel and angelic voices of gratitude. In the second half, the BaläQəne recounts that without rain the farmer will lose all that he has planted. But observing the presence of rain clouds, the farmer will plant his seeds and when it rains all the plants will blossom. For the Wärq, the BaläQəne advises the MQ members to listen to the words of the gospel with love and humility. And the members are overjoyed because Patriarch Paulos, disregarding those advising him to close down the MQ association, allowed the association to continue doing its work.

==Types of Qəne==
Most Qənes are differentiated by their metrical pattern and length of verse.  There are also different types of Qəne which are differentiated by the particular usage of the Säm əna Wärq mode.  Since Qəne is sung as a hymn at a church service, classifying Qənes according to the metrical pattern is commonplace. Accordingly, there are 9 major Qəne types. And since some of them have sub-types, we can say that there are 17 types of Qəne.

The Qəne type is determined by the quantity and length of the verses. Thus there are some Qənes which have the same quantity of verses but are classified as different types of Qəne because of the variation in the length of the verses. A student starts his Qəne education starting from the shorter Qənes and working up to the lengthy Qənes. Each Qəne stage uses the previous stage as a building block. When a student is able to compose all the different types of Qəne, he is said to ''Bet Molla''. When someone presents the full variety of Qənes he is said to have composed ''Mulu Bet''.

===Gubaʾe Qana===

Gubaʾe Qana consists of two verses and symbolizes the divine and human nature of God.  There are four types of Gubaʾe Qana differentiated by length of the verse (Short Gubaʾe Qana and long Gubaʾe Qana) and Zema mode ( Gəʾəz Gubaʾe Qana and ʾəzl Gubaʾe Qana). Some say that Gubaʾe Qana got its name by being presented on Tərr 12 – the commemoration of Qana zägälila (wedding in Cana of Galilee). Others say that it got its name by being presented at an assembly in a place called Qana in Showa. Still others say that the name is given to signify the flavor (Qana) of Qəne. The fact that there are only two verses makes it ideal for beginner students and all Qəne students take their first steps in the world of Qəne with the two verse Gubaʾe Qana.

===Zäʾämlakəye===
Zäʾämlakəye consists of three verses and the zema mode is ʾəzl . The second verse is called Mändärdärya. According to some Qəne experts, the three verses symbolize the mystery of the Trinity. The name Zäʾämlakəye is derived from the fact that this type of Qəne is composed using the first line of Psalm 62 (“አምላኪየ አምላኪየ እገይስ ሀቤከ).

===Mibäzhu===
Just like Zäʾämlakəye, Mibäzhu has three verses. The zema mode is ʾəzl and symbolizes the Trinity. The name Mibäzhu is derived from the fact that this type of Qəne is composed using the first line of Psalm 3  (እግዚኦ ሚበዝኁ እለ ይሳቅዩኒ).

===Wazema===
There are two types of Wazema: Long Wazema (five verses with Araray zema mode) and Short Wazema(two verses). Some say Wazema is named as such because it is composed on the eve (wazema) of a major church holiday. Others say that the name is derived from a line in St. Yared’s chant “ዋይ ዜማ ሰማእኩ እመላእክት ቅዱሳን’’ . The long wazema is always composed on the eve of major church holidays.

===Səllase===
Səllase has six verses and the zema mode is ʾəzl . This Qəne genre symbolizes the 6 commands of the New Testament. The name is derived from the prayer of the 3 children thanking the god of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ይትባረክ እግዚአብሔር አምላከ አበዊነ አምላከ አብርሃም አምላከ ይስሃቅ አምላከ ያዕቆብ.

===Zäyəʾəze===
Zäyəʾəze Qəne is usually presented in honor of a sovereign.  The name is derived from the Psalm where it says “ይዕዜ ትስእሮ ለገብርከ”. There are two types of Zäyəʾəze: long Zäyəʾəze (five verses with Gəʾəz zema mode) and Short Zäyəʾəze  (three verses with Araray zema mode). The Short Zäyəʾəze is also called sahləkä because it is usually presented with the psalm “ተሰሃለኒ እግዚኦ በከመ እበየ ሳህልከ”.

===Mäwädəs===
The word Mäwädəs is derived from the verb ወደሰ and denotes gratefulness. There are two types of Mäwädəs: fətah litä (eight verses with Araray zema mode) and kuləkəmu  (nine verses). Fətah litä is so named because it is performed after Psalm 42 (“ፍታህ ሊተ እግዚኦ ወተበቀል በቀልየ”), while kuləkəmu is performed after Psalm 46 (ኩልክሙ አህዛብ ጥፍሁ እደዊክሙ).

===kəbər yəʾəti===
This four verse Qəne is usually composed about the subject of the Holy Cross. According to the Zema mode, kəbər yəʾəti is classified into two: Gəʾəz kəbər yəʾəti and ʾəzl kəbər yəʾəti. The name kəbər yəʾəti is derived because it is performed after Psalm 149:9 (“ክብር ይእቲ ዛቲ ለከሉ ፃድቃኑ”).

===ʾət’anä mogär===
There are two types of ʾət’anä mogär: Gəʾəz ʾət’anä mogär (seven verses) and ʾəzl ʾət’anä mogär (eleven verses). The first 4 verses of Gəʾəz ʾət’anä mogär and the first 6 verses of ʾəzl ʾət’anä mogär usually recount about the day’s festivity. The last 3 verses of Gəʾəz ʾət’anä mogär and the last 5 verses of ʾəzl ʾət’anä mogär are called ʿäsärä nəgus. The ʿäsärä nəgus is composed in honor of a sovereign or to praise or rebuke a public figure.

==Traditions of Qəne==
There are some well known traditions of Qəne such as Nät’äqa, Gəlbät’a, and Tämäst’o. The mastery of these Qəne traditions is the sign of the BaläQəne’s expertise of the genre and his placement at the summit of the Qəne world.

===Nät’äqa===
As the meaning of the term attests, this tradition signifies the taking away of verses but does not equate with stealing. Nät’äqa  involves finishing off the verses of a Qəne as another person is reciting the beginning verses. This shows that the one who is doing the Nät’äqa already knows what the other composer was going to recite.
Example: Emahoy Gälanäsh’s Nät’äqa of her father’s Qəne

When the father was reciting
   “በታቦርሂ አመ ቀነጸ ምልኮትከ ፈረስ፣” - When your divinity / horse galloped

And the daughter finished the Qəne by saying,
   “ኢክሂሉ ስብሖቶሙ ሙሴ ወኤልያስ፡፡” - Moses and Elijah could not restrain it.

The amazed father then said,
   “በከመ ሰማእኩኪ አነ ኢይሰማእኪ ጳውሎስ!” - I hope St Paul does not hear what I have heard.

Meaning:  When a strong horse gallops it is hard for the rider to restrain it.

Hidden Meaning:  When Jesus took Peter and John with him to the top of Mount Tabor and showed them his transfiguration amongst Moses and Elijah, the disciples were overwhelmed and fell on the ground. The part about St Paul is referring to the Paul’s edict barring women from teaching in public.

===Gəlbät’a===

Gəlbät’a involves taking someone’s Qəne creating a new Qəne by changing the message and rhyming scheme. For example, it is common to wish newlyweds to have a marriage like Abraham and Sarah. But another person can use Gəlbät’a and overturn the blessing by saying let your marriage be not like Abraham and Sarah.  When asked why, one can say may the bride not be mentally anguished as Sarah was when Abraham had a child from Sarah’s Servant Hagar. On the other hand, a fearful Abraham gave away his wife to King Abemelek saying she was his sister – and this is a good reason to overturn the first blessing.

Thus, likewise, one can overturn the message of a Qəne being recited and create a whole new Qəne.  Such practice will help open up new viewpoints of things we are accustomed to and help us list the advantages and disadvantages of a particular knowledge system.

===Tämäst’o===
When composing Qəne, one is usually immersed in deep contemplation (Tämäst’o) and becomes oblivious to one’s surrounding. A well known example of such a deep contemplation is the story of the BaläQəne Kəflä Yohannəs who was active during the reign of Emperor Iyassu I (1674 – 1698).  It is said that Kəflä Yohannəs lived a very humble life and was not popular among the luxury-seeking clergy of the court who were constantly at work to put a rift between him and the emperor.   On one occasion, Kəflä Yohannəs,  deep in contemplation, did not salute   as the Emperor entered the Däbrä Bərhan Səllase Church with his entourage.  The clergy were quick to point out  Kəflä Yohannəs’ faux pas to the Emperor. Knowing that Kəflä Yohannəs meant no malice, the Emperor threw at him a gold nugget to rouse him from his meditation. Kəflä Yohannəs then approached the Emperor and composed the following  Qəne:

    በእስጢፋኖስ አእባን እመ የኀልቁ፣
    ዘበጠኒ ኢያሱ በወርቁ፡፡

    Since all the stones were used on (the martyr) Stephen
    Iyassu stoned me with gold.

The clergy were further disgraced when the Emperor rewarded Kəflä Yohannəs the gold nugget.  Kəflä Yohannəs donated the gold nugget to the church.

The repugnance of markets varies according to time and culture.  [[Slavery]] is a market currently considered repugnant while for most of recorded history before circa 1000 AD it was considered acceptable, and was still considered acceptable against certain people groups until circa 1800 AD.  Examples of markets considered repugnant at one time or place include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7432">'''Rufus Matthew Jones''' (January 25, 1863 &amp;ndash; June 16, 1948) was an American religious leader, writer, [[magazine]] editor, philosopher, and college professor.  He was instrumental in the establishment of the Haverford Emergency Unit (a precursor to the [[American Friends Service Committee]]).  One of the most influential Quakers of the 20th century, he was a [[Quaker]] historian and theologian as well as a philosopher. He is the only person to have delivered two [[Swarthmore Lecture]]s.

==Early life and education==
Jones was born into an old Quaker family in [[South China, Maine]] where he attended services at the [[Pond Meeting House]] and then the newer [[South China Meeting House]]. In 1885 he graduated from [[Haverford College]] in [[Pennsylvania]], and stayed on to earn his [[Master's degree|M.A.]] there in 1886. From 1893 to 1912 he was the editor of the ''Friends' Review'' (later called ''The American Friend''); from this position he tried unsuccessfully to unite the divided body of Quakers. In 1901 Jones received another M. A., from [[Harvard]].
He also began teaching philosophy and psychology at Haverford in 1893 and continued to do so until retiring in 1934. From 1898 to 1936 he served on the board of trustees of [[Bryn Mawr College]].

==Career==
In 1917 he helped found the American Friends Service Committee. In 1927 Jones took a trip to Asia at the invitation of the [[YMCA]].  His main purpose was to address missionaries in China, but he made stops in Japan, India, and Palestine as well.  While in India, Jones visited [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and the birthplace of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].  This trip helped Jones formulate a new approach to missions&amp;mdash;that of giving humanitarian aid to people while respecting other religions and not aggressively converting people to one's own religion. In 1938 he went with George Walton and [[D. Robert Yarnall]] on a mission to [[Nazi]] Germany to try to help Jewish people there after [[Kristallnacht]].

Jones worked hard at soothing some of the hurt from the [[Quaker history#19th century controversies and divisions|19th Century split]] among Friends and had some success. Jones wrote extensively on the topic of [[mysticism]], which is one of the chief aspects of the [[Quaker]] faith.

He distinguished between negating or negative mysticism (making contact with an impersonal force) and affirming or affirmative mysticism (making contact with a personal being).  He upheld that God is a personal being with whom human beings could interact.  He wrote in ''The Trail of Life in the Middle Years'', "The essential characteristic of [mysticism] is the attainment of a personal conviction by an individual that the human spirit and the divine Spirit have met, have found each other, and are in mutual and reciprocal correspondence as spirit with Spirit."  At the same time that he distinguished between negative and affirmative mysticism, he asserted that all negative mystics occasionally take the affirmative approach and that all affirmative mystics tread the negative path from time to time. He exerted a major influence on the life and work of theologian [[Howard Thurman]], who studied with him in 1929-30.

Jones was a member of the Laymen's Commission that toured mission fields in Asia and produced ''[[Re-Thinking Missions: A Laymen's Inquiry after One Hundred Years]]'' (1932).  The conclusions of this inquiry reflect his views as outlined above.

Jones died in 1948 at age 85, in [[Haverford, Pennsylvania]].

A '''showmance''' (sometimes '''show-mance'''), also known as '''show romance''', is a [[romance (love)|romance]] that develops between two individuals in [[theater]], or on [[film]]s and [[television series]] and between [[reality show]] contestants or participants for the running period of the show. When the two actively engage in a "made up" situation, it can be called a '''fauxmance'''. It is also considered a [[neologism]] and its usage is gaining popularity in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/01/25/celebrity-big-brothers-cami-li-tells-calum-best-i-worship-the-ground-you-walk-on-as-perez-hilton-hits-out-at-showmance-5035762/ |title=Celebrity Big Brother 2015: Perez Hilton slams Cami Li Calum Best 'showmance' &amp;#124; Metro News |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=2015-01-25 |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/james-brinsford/cbb-perez-katie-hopkins_b_6569470.html |title=Is Katie Hopkins and Perez Hilton's Relationship the Showmance of 'Celebrity Big Brother'? &amp;#124; James Brinsford |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date=2015-01-29 |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term came to the attention of the mainstream on the non-scripted American television show ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' when it was first used by [[Will Kirby]] in 2001. It has been used in theater on stage for years. Then it moved to films, theater and scripted television,\ It is primarily entered into as a ploy to gain more public and media attention and, in case of television, more camera time during the run of a theater piece, or a television series. It may be also just a [[publicity stunt]]. Showmances during reality shows are often motivated by the participants' wanting viewers to vote to keep them in the show, so that they can see the 'romance' continue. In some competitive reality tv shows (Big Brother or Survivor), contestants often engaged in a showmance for strategic purposes. A showmance couple, by protecting each other and by voting together, maintain power over other contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harley-Lewis |first=Colin |url=http://robhasawebsite.com/sabbermetrics-statistical-showmancing-part-1-big-brother-15-colin-harvey-lewis/|title=Sa[BB]ermetrics: Statistical Showmancing |publisher=robhasawebsite.com |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, when an amorous relationship actually does continue after the end of a show, many people would still allege that it is "just a show" the two are putting on.

Showmance is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''show'' and ''romance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/showmance |title=Definition of “showmance” |publisher=Collinsdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/showmance.html |title=Definition of showmance, BuzzWord from |publisher=Macmillandictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a very few exceptions almost all showmance cases end as soon as the theater piece, or the television series or reality show is over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.reveal.co.uk/showbiz-celeb-gossip/news/a619907/cbbs-chloe-goodman-i-dont-want-a-showmance-in-the-house.html |title=CBB's Chloe Goodman: 'I don't want a showmance in the house!' - Celebrity News News |publisher=Reveal.co.uk |date=2015-01-07 |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although mostly involving two persons, it may also possibly extend into a three-way showmance or foursome often accompanied with real or acted rivalries and jealousies. Although mostly the relations involve partners of the opposite sex, at times, showmances may involve same sex relations as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seals |first=Greg |url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/big-brother-gay-romance-ignored/ |title=Is 'Big Brother' ignoring a budding gay showmance? |publisher=Dailydot.com |date=2015-03-10 |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, a showmance occurs between two people playing lovers. The showmance could be caused because of the close contact between the actors in such situations, or because of a confusion between real emotions and the character's emotions.

The term has however moved to broader general use, describing any "contrived romance", also known as a relationship between two people, when either or both "act out" or fake being in love without meaning it, or in many cases with ulterior motives, like benefiting from the other party or misusing and abusing their feelings.

==Early life and education==
Stanley Hauerwas was raised in [[Pleasant Grove, Texas]], in a working-class family. He attended both Pleasant Grove High School (1954–56) and [[W. W. Samuell High School]] (1956–58).&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Hauerwas, ''Hannah's Child: A Theologian's Memoir'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B Eerdmans Publishing Co., 2010), 17-20.&lt;/ref&gt; As the son of a bricklayer, Hauerwas was early on apprenticed to the craft of bricklaying under his father.&lt;ref&gt;Hauerwas, ''Hannah's Child'', 27–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience was extremely formative for his later life, as he himself has often compared the skill and hard work that bricklaying requires with both his own approach to theological work and the challenges of living a fully Christian life.&lt;ref&gt;Hauerwas writes in his 2010 autobiography, "My father understood that the world was changing; and therefore he never wanted me to follow him into bricklaying. Yet the training I received left an indelible mark on everything I do." (''Hannah's Child'', 36)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hauerwas's family attended Pleasant Mound Methodist Church, where he experienced Baptism, Confirmation and Communion. At the age of 15, he presented himself for ministry at a Sunday night worship service, presuming then that he would be saved.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Hauerwas, ''[https://www.academia.edu/12059569/The_Hauerwas_Reader The Hauerwas Reader]'', ed. John Berkman, Michael G. Cartwright (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2001), p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Pleasant Grove, Hauerwas matriculated at [[Southwestern University]], a liberal arts college affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Prior to the formation of the United Methodist Church in 1968, Southwestern University was affiliated with its predecessor body, the Methodist Church.&lt;/ref&gt; He received a B.A. there in 1962. He was also a member of Phi Delta Theta while at Southwestern University. He went on to earn the [[Bachelor of Divinity|B.D.]], [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], [[Master of Philosophy|M.Phil]] and PhD degrees from [[Yale University]]. Upon delivering the Gifford Lectures in 2001, Hauerwas was also awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]].

Following his graduation from Yale University, Hauerwas taught first at [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]] in Rock Island, Illinois, before joining the faculty at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Hauerwas, ''Hannah's Child'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt; He was later invited to assume a faculty position at the Divinity School of Duke University in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;Hauerwas, ''Hannah's Child'', 173&lt;/ref&gt; where he taught in the area of theological ethics until his retirement in 2013, though he continues to write and speak at Duke as a senior research fellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = How to (Not) Retire Theologically {{!}} Reflections|url = http://reflections.yale.edu/article/test-time-art-aging/how-not-retire-theologically|website = reflections.yale.edu|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he was appointed to a Chair in Theological Ethics at the University of Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/6458/&lt;/ref&gt;

Hauerwas' influences are wide-ranging, including figures as diverse as [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Barth]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[John Howard Yoder]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;Hauerwas, ''Hannah's Child'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time Magazine]]'' in 2001 named him "America's Best Theologian".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Bethke Elshtain, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000859,00.html "Theologian: Christian Contrarian"], ''Time Magazine'' online edition, 17 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; He responded by saying, "'Best' is not a theological category."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hauerwas |first=Stanley |date=2012 |title=Hannah's Child |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. |page=ix |isbn=9780802867391 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Hauerwas was also invited to give the [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[University of St Andrews|St. Andrews]] in [[Scotland]], which were published as ''With the Grain of the Universe'', a text in which Hauerwas argued that Karl Barth was the foremost "natural theologian" of the Gifford Lectures. Such an argument is controversial since Karl Barth is well known as an enemy of [[natural theology]]. For Hauerwas, however, Barth argued that Christian convictions about the world describe God's good creation as it is while emphasizing that such convictions cannot be understood apart from Christian witness.&lt;ref&gt;''With the Grain of the Universe'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press,
2001), 142.&lt;/ref&gt; This, according to Hauerwas, is what makes Barth a proper natural theologian in comparison to [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and [[William James]], who were also featured in the lectures.

Earlier in 1997 he gave the ''[[Scottish Journal of Theology]]'' lectures at Aberdeen, published as ''Sanctify Them in Truth'' (1998).

==Basic theological and philosophical views==
Hauerwas has long been associated with [[narrative theology]] and [[postliberal theology]] (which are closely related but not necessarily synonymous movements).&lt;ref name="goodson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodson|first1=Jacob L.|title=Narrative Theology and the Hermeneutical Virtues: Humility, Patience, Prudence|date=2015|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham MD|isbn=9780739190135|pages=1–14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fi5yBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these movements are attached to Yale biblical scholars [[Brevard Childs]], [[Hans Wilhelm Frei|Hans Frei]], and [[George Lindbeck]]. His ''Reforming Christian Social Ethics: Ten Theses'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hauerwas|first1=Stanley|editor1-last=Berkman|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Cartwright|editor2-first=Michael|title=The Hauerwas Reader|date=1981|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|pages=111–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1981, serves to summarize the key presuppositions of his alternative to what was the dominant account in Christian ethics at that time. The ten theses are listed as follows:

# The social significance of the Gospel requires the recognition of the narrative structure of Christian convictions for the life of the church.
# Every social ethic involves a narrative, whether it is concerned with the formulation of basic principles of social organization and/or with concrete policy alternatives.
# The ability to provide an adequate account of our existence is the primary test of the truthfulness of a social ethic.
# Communities formed by a truthful narrative must provide the skills to transform fate into destiny so that the unexpected, especially as it comes in the form of strangers, can be welcomed as gift. 
# The primary social task of the church is to be itself - that is, a people who have been formed by a story that provides them with the skills for negotiating the danger of this existence, trusting in God's promise of redemption. 
# Christian social ethics can only be done from the perspective of those who do not seek to control national or world history but who are content to live "out of control."
# Christian social ethics depends on the development of leadership in the church that can trust and depend on the diversity of gifts in the community. 
# For the church to be, rather than to have, a social ethic means we must recapture the social significance of common behavior, such as acts of kindness, friendship, and the formation of families. 
# In our attempt to control our society Christians in America have too readily accepted liberalism as a social strategy appropriate to the Christian story. 
# The church does not exist to provide an ethos for democracy or any other form of social organization, but stands as a political alternative to every nation, witnessing to the kind of social life possible for those that have been formed by the story of Christ.

Hauerwas writes of narrative as "the necessary grammar of Christian convictions" in that Christian claims are inextricably linked to what God has done in history and to the ongoing story of God's people as they move through time. This sense of a "hypertemporal God" Hauerwas claims to have gotten from John Howard Yoder, who impressed upon him the need of always locating God's actions in the "timeliness" of the created order as witnessed by the Bible.&lt;ref name="p158"&gt;Hauerwas, ''Hannah's Child'', 158.&lt;/ref&gt; He has explained this understanding of a people (i.e., church) constituted by their ongoing story with God in terms of a pointed and oft-repeated aphorism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
My claim, so offensive to some, that '''the first task of the church is to make the world the world, not to make the world more just,''' is a correlative of this theological metaphysics. The world simply cannot be narrated - the world cannot have a story - unless a people exist who make the world the world. That is an eschatological claim that presupposes we know there was a beginning only because we have seen the end ... [C]reation names God's continuing action, God's unrelenting desire for us to want to be loved by that love manifest in Christ's life, death, and resurrection.&lt;ref name="p158"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As indicated in the quotation above, Hauerwas believes that the strong distinction between the church and the world is a necessary mark of the Christian life. He collaborated with [[William H. Willimon]] (now a retired bishop in the [[United Methodist Church]]) in 1989 to offer an accessible version of his vision of the Christian life in the book ''[[Resident Aliens|Resident Aliens: Life in the Christian Colony]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Hauerwas and William H. Willimon, ''Resident Aliens: Life in the Christian Colony'' (Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of the church is based on both his narrative and postliberal approach to theology, as well as his reading of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s understanding of language and [[language-game|language games]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Being+'other+cheeky'%3a+moral+hazard+and+the+thought+of+Stanley...-a0234140881&lt;/ref&gt;

Hauerwas works from within the tradition of [[virtue ethics]], having been deeply influenced by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and his work ''[[After Virtue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/09/004-the-virtues-of-alasdair-macintyre-6 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712211034/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/09/004-the-virtues-of-alasdair-macintyre-6 |archivedate=2012-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mendeley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/conceptual-problems-stanley-hauerwass-virtue-ethics/|title=Conceptual Problems for Stanley H... preview &amp;amp; related info &amp;#124; Mendeley|publisher=mendeley.com|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hauerwas is also known as an ardent critic of [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/henry/research/symposiumpapers/Symp09Bridges.pdf|format=PDF|title=―Beyond Secular Liberalism, Theological Traditionalism, and Incomplete Pragmatism: A Milbankian Engagement with Jeffrey Stout‘s Democracy and Tradition|author=Thomas Bridges|publisher=Calvin.edu|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, Hauerwas has become conversant with the tradition of [[radical democracy]]. In 2007 he collaborated on a book on the subject with political theorist and ethicst Romand Coles entitled ''Christianity, Democracy, and the Radical Ordinary: Conversations Between a Radical Democrat and a Christian''.&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stanleyhauerwas.blogspot.com/2008/12/christianity-democracy-and-radical.html|title=Stanley Hauerwas: Christianity, Democracy, and the Radical Ordinary: Conversations Between a Radical Democrat and a Christian (2008)|publisher=stanleyhauerwas.blogspot.com|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Hauerwas's most well-known critics are [[Jeffrey Stout]] of Princeton and [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] of Yale, though both have often praised his work as well.&lt;ref name="abc2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2010/09/30/3025745.htm|title=The Private Stanley Hauerwas and his Public Theology &amp;ndash; ABC Religion &amp;amp; Ethics (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|publisher=abc.net.au|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reclaimingthemission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reclaimingthemission.com/jeff-stout-or-hauerwas-…-which-way-forward-for-the-emerging-church/|title=Reclaiming the Mission/ David Fitch &amp;#124; Reflections from living life in Mission where theology, culture and ministry intersect|publisher=reclaimingthemission.com|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="religion-online2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3054|title=Living Faithfully in a Democratic Society|publisher=religion-online.org|accessdate=6 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106225603/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3054|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ssrc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/2009/03/04/whose-injustice-which-rights/|title=Whose injustice?

==Interaction with the thought of the Niebuhrs==
Hauerwas's theological views may be best illuminated by his engagement with the work of [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and [[H. Richard Niebuhr]], often considered two of the most influential American theologians of the 20th century. Hauerwas frequently discusses the work of both [[Niebuhr brothers]], mentioning them in some form in most of his books. Reinhold was also one of the primary subjects of Hauerwas' 2000–2001 [[Gifford Lectures]], which were later republished in book form under the title ''With the Grain of the Universe''.&lt;ref name="directionjournal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directionjournal.org/32/2/with-grain-of-universe.html|title=Direction: With the Grain of the Universe|publisher=directionjournal.org|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catholicbooksreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicbooksreview.org/2003/hauerwas.htm|title=Catholic Studies. Book Review: S. HAUERWAS: With the Grain of the Universe.|author=Pierre HEGY|publisher=catholicbooksreview.org|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of his career Hauerwas was deeply influenced by the work of both brothers. Later, primarily as a result of encountering the work of [[John Howard Yoder]], he came to disagree with fundamental elements of their theology, while continuing to affirm other elements of their work that he found important.&lt;ref name="duke4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.duke.edu/showcase/mmedia/features/911site/hauerwas.html|title=Sept. 11: A Campus Reflects|publisher=today.duke.edu|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="religion-online3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2641|title=A Contested Classic: Critics Ask: Whose Christ? Which Culture?|publisher=religion-online.org|accessdate=6 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106225209/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2641|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many believe that the Niebuhrs' advocacy of [[Christian realism]] represents a rejection of [[liberal Christianity]], Hauerwas argues that the brothers actually belong to that theological tradition. For him, while they both placed a strong emphasis on the sinfulness of humanity (which stood in stark contrast to most liberal thinkers), he believes that the Niebuhrs based their theologies on the presuppositions of secular philosophy rather than those of Christianity, thus placing them in the liberal tradition of modern Christian thought.&lt;ref name="firstthings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-very-american-stanley-hauerwas-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908183733/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-very-american-stanley-hauerwas-15 |archive-date=2010-09-08 |dead-url=yes |title=Article &amp;#124; First Things |accessdate=6 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Hauerwas argues that Reinhold Niebuhr was deeply influenced by [[William James]], accepting a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[epistemology]].&lt;ref name="pubtheo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pubtheo.com/page.asp?pid=1493|title=Public Theology: The Public Theology of Reinhold Niebuhr|publisher=pubtheo.com|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Hauerwas, the Niebuhrs are important figures in part because the flaws in their thinking represent the same flaws which are endemic to much of modern Christianity, with the Church often being shaped more by the culture of [[liberal democracy]] than the message of Jesus.&lt;ref name="stthomas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal2.stthomas.edu/gwschlabach/docs/jhy-aug.htm|title=gwschlabach/docs/jhy-aug|publisher=personal2.stthomas.edu|accessdate=6 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101212144/http://personal2.stthomas.edu/gwschlabach/docs/jhy-aug.htm|archivedate=1 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|r50uiHeewf8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hauerwas' view, this has led the Church (and Christians in general) to compromise their values and place too much faith in secular political ideologies, often leading to a misplaced passion for political power. This represents the thesis of Hauerwas in his most popular book, ''[[Resident Aliens]]'' (which was co-written by [[William Willimon]]). In the book, Hauerwas and Willimon argue that the Church's accommodation to secular culture has led to tragedies like the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima&lt;ref name="theinfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/print/0109/feature.html|title=Lingua Franca - September 2001 &amp;#124; Feature: For God, Not Country|publisher=linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhinet.org/polet22-1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Being ‘Other Cheeky’: Moral Hazard and the Thought of Stanley Hauerwas|author=Jeffrey Polet|publisher=Nhinet.org|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hauerwas, therefore, believes that the Niebuhrs' thinking is subject to the same flaws as [[Jerry Falwell]], with Hauerwas and Willimon stating that "few books have been a greater hindrance to an accurate assessment of [the Church's] situation" than H. Richard Niebuhr's famous book ''Christ and Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Hauerwas and William Willimon, Resident Aliens: A Provocative Christian Assessment of Culture and Ministry for People Who Know That Something is Wrong (Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 1989), 31-40&lt;/ref&gt; Thus according to Hauerwas, while they may have disagreed when it comes to policy, both the Niebuhrs and Falwell fell prey to the notion Christians have a duty to use the political process as a means to enact "Christian" legislation or pursue justice.

In his book ''The Peaceable Kingdom'' Hauerwas offers commentary on two classic essays written by the Niebuhrs for ''[[The Christian Century]]'' on the subject of the [[Pacification of Manchukuo|Conflict in Manchuria]]. In the first essay, entitled "The Grace of Doing Nothing", H. Richard Niebuhr argues that humans are self-interested and egoistic and that Christians, because they are subject to these same flaws, should remain non-violent even in a time of war. In his essay in response, entitled "Must We Do Nothing?", Reinhold Niebuhr argues that Christians must have a self-awareness about their own sinfulness and self-interestedness, but must sometimes use force to protect certain ideals and people. In his commentary Hauerwas acknowledges that both brothers make important points, but critiques Reinhold's view, ultimately agreeing with H. Richard Niebuhr.&lt;ref name="religion-online4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=99|title=Niebuhr Versus Niebuhr: The Tragic Nature of History|publisher=religion-online.org|accessdate=6 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106225944/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=99|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Hauerwas, ''The Peaceable Kingdom: A Primer in Christian Ethics'' (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1983), 135-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on human experimentation==

===Deontological and utilitarian thought===
The basic [[utilitarian]] rationalization for research on human beings is the ends justify the means. Therefore, any sort of research on a human being is justified by the possibility of successfully saving others. For example, all cancer research would be justified by the possibility of finding a cure for cancer, which would inevitably save the life of many others. The utilitarian argument focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number of people or the greater good. Under the utilitarian justification it is a person's duty to sacrifice himself or herself if it would save others as long as the individual person's societal worth is less than the combined societal worth of the others. Therefore, if either a doctor or a homeless person must die to save the lives of many others, the homeless person must sacrifice himself since he is worth less to society than the doctor.

The [[deontological]] argument against research on human beings is that persons are an ends in themselves. This means we cannot use people for any purpose. The deontological argument relies on the belief that we should treat others as we would like to be treated. If someone was suffering from a terminal illness and they were likely to die shortly, under deontological assumptions research could not be done on them even if it meant saving the lives of millions.

===Understanding of experimentation===
Hauerwas finds these two moral theories very limiting because they are quandary ethics, cases that rely on extreme situations. He believes that there needs to be a third reasoning that falls somewhere in between these two. He believes that the basic doctor-patient relationship should be built on trust and caring. This characterizes him as more of deontological thinker; however, he does believe in research on human beings. Hauerwas’s perspective is that there needs to be a middle ground between these two perspectives. The patient becomes dehumanized through research; however, without this research there would be little medical improvement. Hauerwas therefore believes this middle ground should focus on caring for the patient instead of curing. With this, Hauerwas believes we do not have the moral understanding to handle current medicine.

As mentioned above, Hauerwas believes that the moral issue of experimentation on humans cannot be answered from a utilitarianism versus deontological perspective. He believes that society lacks a cohesive understanding of the notions of “the good of mankind” and “the rights of the individual.”  Only when this issue is solved can society come to a conclusive decision on how science should be used to serve humans needs. Therapeutic and nontherapeutic experimentation on humans are differentiated by the intent of the procedure. Therapeutic experimentation is meant to help the patient with their current needs, while nontherapeutic experimentation has no intention of helping the patient, but to collect research for the benefit of future patients. The issue becomes: should medical progress be helping the current patient or the future patient? Stanley Hauerwas believes society has no consensus of the meanings of health and illness, which contributes to the issue of how patients should be treated. Only when society comes to a universal understanding of these issues can the moral dilemma of experimentation on humans be resolved.

===Informed consent===
Hauerwas finds little justification for human experimentation through informed consent. He argues that a patient’s understanding of an experimental procedure will never approach that of his or her physician. He questions even the possibility of a patient reaching a state of “informed consent.” He further believes that if individuals reach such a state of “informed consent”, this does not mean individuals should consent, or fully understand the meaning of their consent. “For persons can misuse themselves even if they do so voluntarily and with full knowledge.”&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Hauerwas, ''Suffering Presence: Theological Reflections on Medicine, the Mentally Handicapped, and the Church'' (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1986), 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals consenting to experimentation through the justification of the human good, turn themselves into objects for the use of the experimentation. The issue is further complicated for Hauerwas as to whom should be considered for medical experimentation. The use of prisoners only proliferates social stereotypes and denigration. He believes that informed consent is necessary for human experimentation, but it does not provide justification for our willingness to submit and participate in experimentation.

===Language of rights===
Hauerwas finds the language of “rights” to be disturbing as it assumes that people relate to others as strangers, and lends even the understanding of the family to that of a contractual society. He argues that being part of a family, however, is not a voluntary undertaking. As such, when one is part of a family, the kinds of responsibilities each member holds are in relation to each other. Hauerwas finds that as a parent, you have a duty to your children, not just because you brought them into existence, but because the role of parent is to ensure the children are brought up in a way that is conducive to the community’s values. Thus, the issue with “rights” language is that it attempts to prevent maltreatment of individuals to the point of exclusion of familial and communal responsibility. Hauerwas’s bottom line is that there can be no real society if its members only relate in terms of noninterference. The language of rights destroys society because we regard people as strangers instead of assuming the responsibility towards them as family and members of the community that we share.

==Views on death and dying well==
Hauerwas believes that there is a difference between the concept of death and the criteria for death. The concept of death “involves a philosophical judgment of a significant change that has happened in a person”&lt;ref name="p89"&gt;Hauerwas, ''Suffering Presence'', p89.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore “is a correlative of what one takes to be the necessary condition of human life, e.g., … the potential for consciousness”.&lt;ref name="p89"/&gt; The criteria of death, however, are “those empirical measurements that can be made to determine whether a person is dead, such as cessation of respiration or a flat EEG”.&lt;ref name="p89"/&gt; Thus, brain death is a criterion of death that may serve “as a symbol of when it is time to die”.&lt;ref&gt;Hauerwas, ''Suffering Presence'', p98.&lt;/ref&gt; A person must not delay death so long that it is no longer possible to die a good death.

On the subject of suicide, Hauerwas challenges the claim that autonomous suicide is morally acceptable, but also wants to distinguish himself from the position that denies rational suicide. He believes that suicide can be and often is a rational decision of an “autonomous” agent, but does not agree with the notion that it is justified. He contends that suicide as an institution must be considered morally doubtful, as the life that we are given should be considered a gift bestowed upon us by God. To many, the term "rational suicide" is based on the assumption that the decision to live or die depends on whether life has a meaning or purpose.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Hauerwas, however, contends that the reason we should live on, is because our lives are not ours, and as such, reminds us that there is a commitment to keep on living. Yet, while there may be times in our lives where suicide may seem rational, mere existence allows us to enjoy certain joys, such as helping another, or healing the sick, that should be enough to sustain our commitment to living.

According to Hauerwas, a “good death is a death that we can prepare for through living because we are able to see that death is but a necessary correlative to a good life." A long life may give a person more of a chance to have a good death because he may be able to get himself morally in line during that time period, but it is also possible to die well quickly if you have lived morally. A good death also requires that the death be morally in proportion with the way one lived and was sustained, and occurs in a way that allows those caring for us to see that they are sustaining us.

On the subject of abortion, Hauerwas notes that "Christians in America are tempted to think of issues like abortion primarily in legal terms such as ''rights.''" Another move is to view abortion in medical terms. Hauerwas observes that "Christians maintain that the description ''abortion'' is more accurate and determinative than the description ''termination of pregnancy.''" Seeing abortion rightly is akin to understanding that ''abortion'' is "as much a moral description as ''suicide.''" A community maintains a description like "suicide" to remind itself to practice enhancing life, even when difficult--just as the people of God have an obligation to protect vulnerable human life even when it is "unplanned."&lt;ref name="lifewatch1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lifewatch.org/abortion.html |title=Abortion Theologically Understood |publisher=[[Lifewatch, Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality]] |accessdate=2017-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416221413/http://www.lifewatch.org/abortion.html |archive-date=2017-04-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of patience and courage==
According to his essay, "Practicing Patience: How Christians Should Be Sick", in ''Christians Among the Virtues'', he said that Christians are called to be patient patients in sickness and in health because "patience is integral to the Christian life". Patience cannot be first learned while being a patient. To learn patience, Christians are to exercise the virtue through deeds, truth, practice, and living it. Hauerwas also says that patience is a virtue we have in common with God. "In Him, patience has its beginning, and from Him as its source it takes its splendor and dignity." He also says that God showed us the best example of patience when it comes to the life of Jesus. Because God is the foundation, Hauerwas stated that “only patience shaped by Christ is true patience". As well as this, he later emphasized that patience is not developed by human will, but given through the Holy Spirit, who gives us the capacity to love, for “without [love] in us there cannot be patience because in good men it is the [love] of God which endures all things.” In the author’s essay, he gave people a framework of how to learn to practice patience when we are not sick:
1.	We have been given one another to learn to live with one another.
2.	We’ve been given time and space to develop habits from activities that require patience.&lt;ref&gt;Hauerwas, S., &amp; Pinches, C. R. (1997). "Practicing Patience: How Christians Should Be Sick", ''Christians Among the Virtues: Theological Conversations with Ancient and Modern Ethics'' (pp. 166-178). Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hauerwas speaks about courage in his essay "Courage Exemplified", in ''Christians Among the Virtues''. He first looked to Aristotle, who firmly believed soldiers could only show courage. He also said that courage is acquired through imitation of action and emotion, and virtue required practice before it was mastered. Hauerwas indicated that to Aristotle, “without war, courage could not be fully known." The philosopher also spoke of Aquinas’ view of courage. To begin, he expressed that to Aquinas, charity is the central trunk from which all the other virtues branch out, which includes courage. In contrast to Aristotle, courage isn’t just for battlefield; it adds any situation one might face danger and death, such as tending to the sick bed of loved one or going on a walk into the unknown with a friend. According to the essay, Aquinas “treats fortitude in such a way that its ends are transformed by charity.” Even though a situation might be dangerous, the individual is courageous because they possess love for the person they are helping. Courage, then, is more accessible opposed to Aristotle’s view.
To transition, Hauerwas added the Christian to the mix when he narrated that Christianity requires courage which is “a kind of endurance in the face of difficulty, danger, or oppression." To tie in the first essay, he went on to say that patience and perseverance are “integral to the very meaning of virtue." All of this is to say that the Christian must have the patience to get through tough times. To him, the ultimate display of courage is through the martyr, who is “required to patiently persevere, since they have the confidence that enduring wrong is the gift of charity." The philosopher also highlighted that true courage is a gift of the Holy Spirit when he said that “courage is a gift of the Spirit that protects the martyr from the ‘dread of danger.’" The martyr is the best example because they believe that “God will complete God’s work in [them] even if [their] lives are taken by [the] enemies." In the eyes of both Aquinas the Hauerwas, “those formed by the courage necessary to face death well will be more easily led to the fuller amount of courage offered by Christians."

Overall, Hauerwas believes that America is not courageous because it does not act out of charity. He believes that the church can do it, but he questions whether America as a whole is able to. His answer is that it cannot. “We in America have lost our moral vision precisely as we have lost our courage to fight for what is right and good." &lt;ref&gt;Hauerwas, S., &amp; Pinches, C. R. (1997). "Courage Exemplified", ''Christians Among the Virtues: Theological Conversations with Ancient and Modern Ethics'' (pp. 149-165). Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Election of Donald Trump===
in January 2017, Hauerwas wrote an op-ed for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in which he argues that [[President Donald Trump]] is an exemplar of [[American civil religion]] and distorted theology.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/01/27/christians-dont-be-fooled-trump-has-deep-religious-convictions/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Freethinker''''' was a British [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] [[magazine]], founded by [[George William Foote|G.W. Foote]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atheism and Humanism Links|url=http://arthurchappell.me.uk/links-atheism.humanism.htm|work=Arthur Chappell|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the world's oldest surviving [[freethought]] publications, it moved online-only in 2014.

It has always taken an unapologetically [[atheism|atheist]], [[anti-religious]] stance. In Issue 1 (May, 1881), Foote set out ''The Freethinker's'' purpose:

{{quote|''The Freethinker'' is an [[anti-Christian]] organ, and must therefore be chiefly aggressive. It will wage relentless war against [[superstition]] in general, and against Christian superstition in particular. It will do its best to employ the resources of Science, Scholarship, Philosophy and Ethics against the claims of the Bible as a Divine Revelation; and it will not scruple to employ for the same purpose any weapons of ridicule or sarcasm that may be borrowed from the armoury of Common Sense.}}

Although closely linked with the [[National Secular Society]] for most of its history (NSS Presidents and General Secretaries have at various times also served as ''Freethinker'' editor), ''The Freethinker'' is strictly autonomous and is not, and never has been, published by the NSS.

In 2006, the magazine's front-page masthead was changed from "Secular humanist monthly" to "The Voice of [[Atheism]] since 1881".

[[Barry Duke]] is the current editor.

==History==
Following the publication of anti-religious cartoons in the [[Christmas]] 1882 edition of ''The Freethinker'', Foote was prosecuted for [[blasphemy]], and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with hard labour.

The April 2014 edition of ''The Freethinker'' contained an announcement that the May issue would be the last to appear in print; publication would continue online.&lt;ref&gt;http://freethinker.co.uk/2014/04/01/the-future-of-the-freethinker-an-important-announcement/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Tom Sherbourne, a [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|traumatised and withdrawn]] hero of [[World War I]], is hired as a [[lighthouse keeper|lightkeeper]] at Janus Rock, a lighthouse off the coast of [[Western Australia]]. He falls in love with a local girl, Isabel Graysmark, and they marry in 1921. Isabel loses two pregnancies in three years and fears she may never become a mother.

Shortly after Isabel's second [[miscarriage]], a rowboat containing a dead man and a newborn baby girl washes ashore near the lighthouse. Tom knows that regulations require him to report the discovery. However, Isabel fears that the baby will almost certainly be sent to an [[orphanage]] and persuades Tom to pass the baby off as their own. Tom grudgingly agrees. He buries the man on the island, and the couple names the girl Lucy.

As Tom and Isabel are about to have Lucy [[Infant baptism|christened]] on the mainland, Tom sees a woman, Hannah Roennfeldt, kneeling in front of a grave bearing the names of Frank Roennfeldt and his baby daughter Grace Ellen, who were lost at sea on the day they found Lucy, 26 April 1923. Tom fears that Lucy might very well be Hannah's missing daughter. He writes anonymously to Hannah to tell her that her husband is dead but that her baby is safe and well cared-for.

Four years later, Tom, Isabel, and Lucy, who have enjoyed an idyllic life together, attend a ceremony for the anniversary of Tom's lighthouse, and they strike up a conversation with Hannah and her sister, Gwen Potts. They learn that Frank was a German, that Hannah's marrying him so soon after the First World War was controversial, and that he had been accosted in the street by a drunken crowd. He jumped into a rowboat and fled with his baby daughter. 

Tormented by his conscience, Tom sends Hannah a small rattle that was found with Lucy on the boat. One of Tom's co-workers recognizes the rattle on a reward poster and reports him to the police.

Tom takes full responsibility, claiming he bullied Isabel into complying. Isabel is enraged that Tom is willing to give Lucy away and breaks off contact with him after his arrest.  Lucy is returned to her birth family but initially rejects and hates them, having no memory of them. She refuses to answer to "Grace" and even runs away in an effort to return to the lighthouse.

The police accuse Tom of murdering Frank and are unable to draw an answer from the distraught Isabel as to whether or not Frank was dead when they discovered him. Lucy runs away to look for the lighthouse, and a search team is sent to rescue her. She is found and returned to Hannah, but the events lead Hannah to realize that Lucy now belongs to Isabel. 

Hannah promises to return Lucy to Isabel as soon as Isabel testifies against Tom. Just as Tom is about to be taken by boat to [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] for trial, Isabel reads a letter which Tom had sent her, confiding he had not deserved his happiness with Lucy and how carrying the blame will assuage his [[survivor guilt|guilt for surviving the war]]. 

Isabel jumps on the boat and confesses everything. Moved by their gesture and reminded by Frank's words to always forgive others, Hannah offers to speak on their behalf at trial. Lucy has at last begun to bond with her biological mother and grandfather, who agrees to call her "Lucy-Grace" as a compromise.

In 1950, an adult Lucy-Grace Rutherford, accompanied by her baby son Christopher, tracks Tom down. She has not been in contact with the Sherbournes for over twenty years, as they had agreed not to contact her for the rest of her childhood. Isabel has recently died, still tormented with guilt for her actions, and Tom gives Lucy-Grace a letter that Isabel had written in case Lucy ever made contact. An emotional Lucy-Grace thanks Tom, the only father she knew, for rescuing and raising her for the few years on Janus, and she asks if she can visit again. She and Tom embrace before she leaves.

'''''The Limits Of State Action''''' (original German title ''Ideen zu einem Versuch die Grenzen der Wirksamkeit des Staats zu bestimmen'') is a philosophical treatise by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], which is a major work of the German [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Though written in the early 1790s, it was not published in its entirety until 1852, long after von Humboldt's death in 1835. It was a significant source for the ideas that [[John Stuart Mill]] popularized in his 1859 book ''[[On Liberty]]'', and is discussed favorably by Mill in the third chapter of that work, "Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart (1859). ''On Liberty''.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill had access to an 1854 English translation under the title ''The Sphere and Duties of Government''.

Humboldt defines the criteria by which the permissible limits of the state's activities may be determined. His basic principle, like that of Mill, is that the only justification for government interference is the prevention of harm to others. He discusses in detail the role and limits of the state's responsibility for the welfare, security and morals of its citizens.

Wilhelm von Humboldt describes his purpose in writing ''The Limits of State Action'' as:
"The grand, leading principle, towards which every argument … unfolded in these pages directly converges, is the absolute and essential importance of human development in its richest diversity."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sphere and Duties of Government.'' Translated from the German of Baron Wilhelm von Humboldt, by Joseph Coulthard, Jun. (London: John Chapman, 1854).&lt;/ref&gt;  Many commentators&lt;!-- can't be vague like this on wikipedia --&gt; believe that Humboldt’s discussion of issues of freedom and individual responsibility possesses greater clarity and directness than [[John Stuart Mill]]’s.  “Germany’s greatest philosopher of freedom,” as [[F. A. Hayek]] called him,&lt;!-- need citation of where F.A. Hayek said this, but also need to use your own words and not a quote on wikipedia --&gt; has an exuberance and attention to principle that make it a valuable introduction to classical liberal political thought. It is also crucial for an understanding of liberalism as it developed in Europe at the turn of the nineteenth century. Humboldt explores the role that liberty plays in individual development, discusses criteria for permitting the state to limit individual actions, and suggests ways of confining the state to its proper bounds. In so doing, he uniquely combines the ancient concern for human excellence and the modern concern for what has come to be known as negative liberty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">'''''The Ten Commandments of Dog Ownership''''', also known as '''''The Ten Commandments From a Pet's Point of View''''' or simply '''''Ten Commandments For Dog Owners''''', is a set of pet ownership rules. It was created in 1993 by [[Stan Rawlinson]], and is written from the point of view of a dog.&lt;ref name="thedoglistener"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.doglistener.co.uk/humour/commandments.shtml |title=The 10 Commandments From a Pet's Point of View  |accessdate=21 March 2012 |work= Stan Rawlinson | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nipponcinemareview" /&gt;

This set of rules was used as the basis of the 2008 Japanese film ''[[10 Promises to My Dog]]''.&lt;ref name="nipponcinemareview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nipponcinema.com/blog/10-promises-to-my-dog |title=Review: 10 Promises to My Dog (Inu to Watashi no 10 no Yakusoku) |accessdate=21 March 2012 |work= Nippon Cinema | date= 20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commandments convey the dog's perspective to elicit empathy from humans in their role as owner. They are written from the dog's viewpoint and they allude to principles assumed important to dogs. Commandments convey ideas of trust, tolerance, anger, hurt, pain, and forgiveness amongst others.

==Popular culture==
The Ten Commandments of Dog Ownership was translated in Japanese and compiled into a [[tankōbon]] by author [[Rie Hasegawa]].&lt;ref name="amazonjapan"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/453725226X |title=犬の十戒 on Amazon Japan |accessdate=21 March 2012 |work= Amazon.com, Inc. | date= |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book was published by [[Nihon Bungeisha]], and was released in Japan on September 2004.&lt;ref name="amazonjapan" /&gt;

Additionally, The Ten Commandments of Dog Ownership was used as an inspiration for a novel written by [[Hare Kawaguchi]].&lt;ref name="nipponcinemareview" /&gt; Published on 28 July 2007, this book is entitled  {{Nihongo|''10 Promises To My Dog''|犬と私の１０の約束 |Inu to Watashi no jyuu no Yakusoku}}.&lt;ref name="amazonjapan2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4163261702/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327134741&amp;sr=1-4 |title=犬と私の10の約束 on Amazon Japan |accessdate=21 March 2012 |work= Amazon.com, Inc. | date= |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''10 Promises To My Dog'' was later adapted into a 2008 Japanese film of [[10 Promises to My Dog|the same name]].&lt;ref name="nipponcinemareview" /&gt; The film was directed by [[Katsuhide Motoki]], and stars [[Rena Tanaka]], [[Mayuko Fukuda]], [[Etsushi Toyokawa]].&lt;ref name="nipponcinemareview" /&gt;

==Definition==
Theory of mind is a [[theory]] insofar as the mind is the only thing being directly observed.&lt;ref name="Premack, D. G. 1978"/&gt; The presumption that others have a mind is termed a theory of mind because each human can only intuit the existence of their own mind through introspection, and no one has direct access to the mind of another. It is typically assumed that others have minds analogous to one's own, and this assumption is based on the reciprocal, social interaction, as observed in [[joint attention]],&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251"&gt;{{citation | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Baron-Cohen | contribution = Precursors to a theory of mind: Understanding attention in others | editor-last = Whiten | editor-first = Andrew | title = Natural theories of mind: evolution, development, and simulation of everyday mindreading | pages = 233&amp;ndash;251 | publisher = B.

Smith, Eds. Theories of theories of mind. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Having theory of mind allows one to attribute thoughts, desires, and intentions to others, to predict or explain their actions, and to posit their intentions. As originally defined, it enables one to understand that mental states can be the cause of—and thus be used to explain and predict—the behavior of others.&lt;ref name="Premack, D. G. 1978"/&gt; Being able to attribute mental states to others and understanding them as causes of behavior implies, in part, that one must be able to conceive of the mind as a "generator of representations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Courtin | first1 = C. | year = 2000 | title = The impact of sign language on the cognitive development of deaf children: The case of theories of mind | url = | journal = Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education | volume = 5| issue =3| pages = 266–276 | doi = 10.1093/deafed/5.3.266 | pmid=15454505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Courtin | first1 = C. | last2 = Melot | first2 = A.-M. | year = 2005 | title = Metacognitive development of deaf children: Lessons from the appearance-reality and false belief tasks | url = | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 16–25 | pmid = 15647063 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00389.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person does not have a complete theory of mind, it may be a sign of cognitive or developmental impairment.

Theory of mind appears to be an innate potential ability in humans that requires social and other experience over many years for its full development. Different people may develop more, or less, effective theory of mind. [[Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] maintain that theory of mind is a byproduct of a broader [[hypercognitive]] ability of the human mind to register, monitor, and represent its own functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A., Mouyi, A., &amp; Spanoudis, G. (2010). The development of mental processing. Nesselroade, J. R. (2010). Methods in the study of life-span human development: Issues and answers. In W. F. Overton (Ed.), Biology, cognition and methods across the life-span. Volume 1 of the Handbook of life-span development (pp. 36-55), Editor-in-chief: R. M. Lerner. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empathy]] is a related concept, meaning the recognition and understanding of the states of mind of others, including their beliefs, desires and particularly emotions. This is often characterized as the ability to "put oneself into another's shoes". Recent [[ethology|neuro-ethological]] studies of animal behaviour suggest that even rodents may exhibit ethical or empathetic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;de Waal, Franz B.M. (2007), "Commiserating Mice" ''Scientific American'', 24 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While empathy is known as emotional perspective-taking, theory of mind is defined as cognitive perspective-taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hynes|first=Catherine A.|last2=Baird|first2=Abigail A.|last3=Grafton|first3=Scott T.|title=Differential role of the orbital frontal lobe in emotional versus cognitive perspective-taking|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=44|issue=3|pages=374–383|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.06.011|pmid=16112148|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on theory of mind, in humans and animals, adults and children, normally and atypically developing, has grown rapidly in the 35 years since [[David Premack|Premack]] and Guy Woodruff's paper, "Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?".&lt;ref name="Premack, D. G. 1978" /&gt; The emerging field of [[social neuroscience]] has also begun to address this debate, by imaging the brains of humans while they perform tasks demanding the understanding of an intention, belief or other mental state in others.

An alternative account of theory of mind is given within [[Operant conditioning|operant]] psychology and provides significant [[empirical evidence]] for a functional account of both perspective-taking and empathy. The most developed operant approach is founded on research on derived relational responding and is subsumed within what is called [[Relational frame theory|relational frame theory]]. According to this view, empathy and perspective-taking comprise a complex set of derived relational abilities based on learning to discriminate and respond verbally to ever more complex relations between self, others, place, and time, and through established relations.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S. C., Barnes-Holmes, D., &amp; Roche, B. (2001). Relational frame theory:  A post-Skinnerian account of human language and cognition.  New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rehfeldt, R. A., and Barnes-Holmes, Y., (2009).

Oakland, CA: New Harbinger.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and psychological roots==
Contemporary discussions of Theory of Mind have their roots in philosophical debate—most broadly, from the time of Descartes' ''Second Meditation'', which set the groundwork for considering the science of the mind. Most prominent recently are two contrasting approaches in the philosophical literature, to theory of mind: [[theory-theory]] and [[simulation theory of empathy|simulation theory]]. The theory-theorist imagines a veritable theory—"folk psychology"—used to reason about others' minds. The theory is developed automatically and innately, though instantiated through social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, P. (1996). Simulation and self-knowledge: a defence of the theory-theory. In P. Carruthers &amp; P.K. Smith, Eds. ''Theories of theories of mind.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also closely related to  [[Social perception|person perception]] and  [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution theory]] from social psychology.

The intuitive assumption that others are minded is an apparent tendency we all share. We [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] non-human animals, inanimate objects, and even natural phenomena. [[Daniel Dennett]] referred to this tendency as taking an "[[intentional stance]]" toward things: we assume they have intentions, to help predict future behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D. (1987). The Intentional Stance. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is an important distinction between taking an "intentional stance" toward something and entering a "shared world" with it. The intentional stance is a detached and functional theory we resort to during interpersonal interactions. A shared world is directly perceived and its existence structures reality itself for the perceiver. It is not just automatically applied to perception; it in many ways constitutes perception.

The philosophical roots of the relational frame theory (RFT) account of Theory of Mind arise from contextual psychology and refer to the study of organisms (both human and non-human) interacting in and with a historical and current situational context. It is an approach based on contextualism, a philosophy in which any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context and in which a radically functional approach to truth and meaning is adopted. As a variant of contextualism, RFT focuses on the construction of practical, scientific knowledge. This scientific form of contextual psychology is virtually synonymous with the philosophy of operant psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Functional Contextualism | publisher=Association for Contextual Behavioral Science | url=http://www.contextualpsychology.org/functional_contextualism_0 | first=Eric | last=Fox | accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The study of which animals are capable of attributing knowledge and mental states to others, as well as the development of this ability in human [[ontogeny]] and [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]], has identified several behavioral precursors to theory of mind. Understanding attention, understanding of others' intentions, and imitative experience with other people are hallmarks of a theory of mind that may be observed early in the development of what later becomes a full-fledged theory. In studies with non-human animals and pre-verbal humans, in particular, researchers look to these behaviors preferentially in making inferences about mind.                                                                                    
                                                                                         
[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] identified the infant's understanding of attention in others, a social skill found by 7 to 9 months of age, as a "critical precursor" to the development of theory of mind.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251" /&gt; Understanding attention involves understanding that seeing can be directed selectively as attention, that the looker assesses the seen object as "of interest", and that seeing can induce beliefs. Attention can be directed and shared by the act of pointing, a joint attention behavior that requires taking into account another person's mental state, particularly whether the person notices an object or finds it of interest. {{anchor|protodeclarative}} Baron-Cohen speculates that the inclination to spontaneously reference an object in the world as of interest ("protodeclarative pointing") and to likewise appreciate the directed attention and interests of another may be the underlying motive behind all human communication.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251"/&gt;

Understanding of others' intentions is another critical precursor to understanding other minds because intentionality, or "aboutness", is a fundamental feature of mental states and events. The "intentional stance" has been defined by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dennett | first1 = Daniel C. | year = 1987 | title = Reprint of Intentional systems in cognitive ethology: The Panglossian paradigm defended (to p. 260) | journal = The Brain and Behavioral Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 343–390 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00016393}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an understanding that others' actions are goal-directed and arise from particular beliefs or desires. Both 2- and 3-year-old children could discriminate when an experimenter intentionally vs. accidentally marked a box with stickers as baited.&lt;ref name="Call, J. 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Call | first1 = J. | last2 = Tomasello | first2 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Distinguishing intentional from accidental actions in orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and human children (Homo sapiens) | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 112 | issue = 2| pages = 192–206 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.112.2.192 | pmid = 9642787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier in ontogeny, [[Andrew N. Meltzoff]] found that 18-month-old infants could perform target manipulations that adult experimenters attempted and failed, suggesting the infants could represent the object-manipulating behavior of adults as involving goals and intentions.&lt;ref name="Meltzoff, A. 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meltzoff | first1 = A. | year = 1995 | title = Understanding the intentions of others: Re-enactment of intended acts by 18-month-old children | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 838–850 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.31.5.838 | pmid = 25147406 | pmc = 4137788 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While attribution of intention (the box-marking) and knowledge (false-belief tasks) is investigated in young humans and nonhuman animals to detect precursors to a theory of mind, Gagliardi et al. have pointed out that even adult humans do not always act in a way consistent with an attributional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gagliardi | first1 = J. L. | year = 1995 | title = Seeing and knowing: Knowledge attribution versus stimulus control in adult humans (Homo sapiens) | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 109 | issue = 2| pages = 107–114 |name-list-format=vanc| display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.109.2.107 | pmid = 7758287 | last2 = Kirkpatrick-Steger | first2 = KK | last3 = Thomas | first3 = J | last4 = Allen | first4 = GJ | last5 = Blumberg | first5 = MS }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the experiment, adult human subjects made choices about baited containers when guided by confederates who could not see (and therefore, not know) which container was baited.

Recent research in developmental psychology suggests that the infant's ability to imitate others lies at the origins of both theory of mind and other social-cognitive achievements like perspective-taking and empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Meltzoff | first = Andrew N. | contribution = Imitation as a mechanism of social cognition: Origins of empathy, theory of mind, and the representation of action | editor-last = Goswami | editor-first = Usha | title = Blackwell handbook of childhood cognitive development | pages = 6&amp;ndash;25 | publisher = Blackwell Publishers | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780631218401 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Meltzoff, the infant's innate understanding that others are "like me" allows it to recognize the equivalence between the physical and mental states apparent in others and those felt by the self. For example, the infant uses his own experiences, orienting his head/eyes toward an object of interest to understand the movements of others who turn toward an object, that is, that they will generally attend to objects of interest or significance. Some researchers in comparative disciplines have hesitated to put a too-ponderous weight on imitation as a critical precursor to advanced human social-cognitive skills like mentalizing and empathizing, especially if true imitation is no longer employed by adults. A test of imitation by Alexandra Horowitz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horowitz | first1 = Alexandra C. | year = 2003 | title = Do humans ape? or Do apes human? Imitation and intention in humans and other animals | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 325–336 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.117.3.325 | pmid = 14498809 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.688.3721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that adult subjects imitated an experimenter demonstrating a novel task far less closely than children did. Horowitz points out that the precise psychological state underlying imitation is unclear and cannot, by itself, be used to draw conclusions about the mental states of humans.

While much research has been done on infants, theory of mind develops continuously throughout childhood and into late adolescence as the synapses (neuronal connections) in the prefrontal cortex develop. The prefrontal cortex is thought to be involved in planning and decision-making.&lt;ref name="Laghi 2016 207–216"&gt;{{citation | last = Laghi | first = Fiorenzo | year = 2016 | title = The Role of Nice and Nasty Theory of Mind in Teacher-Selected Peer Models for Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders | journal = Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 207–216 | doi = 10.1177/0748175615596784 | last2 = Lonigro | first2 = Antonia | last3 = Levanto | first3 = Simona | last4 = Ferraro | first4 = Maurizio | last5 = Baumgartner | first5 = Emma | last6 = Baiocco | first6 = Roberto }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children seem to develop theory of mind skills sequentially. The first skill to develop is the ability to recognize that others have diverse desires. Children are able to recognize that others have diverse beliefs soon after. The next skill to develop is recognizing that others have access to different knowledge bases. Finally, children are able to understand that others may have '''false beliefs''' and that others are capable of hiding emotions. While this sequence represents the general trend in skill acquisition, it seems that more emphasis is placed on some skills in certain cultures, leading to more valued skills to develop before those that are considered not as important. For example, in individualistic cultures such as the United States, a greater emphasis is placed on the ability to recognize that others have different opinions and beliefs. In a collectivistic culture, such as China, this skill may not be as important and therefore may not develop until later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Etel | first = Evren | year = 2015 | title = Social Competence, Theory of Mind, and Executive Function in Institution-reared Turkish Children | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 519–529 | doi = 10.1177/0165025414556095 | last2 = Yagmurlu | first2 = Bilge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
There is evidence to believe that the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans. One meta-analysis showed a moderate to strong correlation (''r'' = 0.43) between performance on theory of mind and language tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milligan|first=Karen|last2=Astington|first2=Janet Wilde|last3=Dack|first3=Lisa Ain | title = Language and theory of mind: meta-analysis of the relation between language ability and false-belief understanding | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 622&amp;ndash;646 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01018.x | pmid = 17381794 | date = March–April 2007 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; One might argue that this relationship is due solely to the fact that both language and theory of mind seem to begin to develop substantially around the same time in children (between ages 2–5). However, many other abilities develop during this same time period as well, and do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind. There must be something else going on to explain the relationship between theory of mind and language.

Pragmatic theories of communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Relevance : communication and cognition|last=Dan.|first=Sperber|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|others=Wilson, Deirdre.|isbn=978-0631198789|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=32589501}}&lt;/ref&gt; assume that infants must possess an understanding of beliefs and mental states of others to infer the communicative content that proficient language users intend to convey. Since a verbal utterance is often underdetermined, and therefore, it can have different meanings depending on the actual context theory of mind abilities can play a crucial role in understanding the communicative and informative intentions of others and inferring the meaning of words. Some empirical results&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Gergely|first2=György|date=2018-06-22|title=Communicative mind-reading in preverbal infants|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27804-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=9534|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27804-4|pmid=29934630|pmc=6015048|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that even 13-month-old infants have an early capacity for communicative mind-reading that enables them to infer what relevant information is transferred between communicative partners, which implies that human language relies at least partially on theory of mind skills.

Carol A. Miller posed further possible explanations for this relationship. One idea was that the extent of verbal communication and conversation involving children in a family could explain theory of mind development. The belief is that this type of language exposure could help introduce a child to the different mental states and perspectives of others.&lt;ref name="Miller child"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Carol A. | title = Developmental relationships between language and theory of mind | journal = American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 142&amp;ndash;154 | doi = 10.1044/1058-0360(2006/014) | pmid = 16782686 | date = May 2006 | ref = harv }} [https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/32501769/Miller_06_offprint.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1508793985&amp;Signature=CJF5VXW6%2B%2FaiCFjyDr%2FfqeLHkh8%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DA_What_Is_a_Theory_of_Mind.pdf Pdf.]{{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been suggested empirically by findings indicating that participation in family discussion predict scores on theory of mind tasks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruffman | first1 = Ted | last2 = Slade | first2 = Lance | last3 = Crowe | first3 = Elena | title = The relation between children's and mothers' mental state language and theory-of-mind understanding | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 734&amp;ndash;751 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00435 | pmid = 12038548 | date = May–June 2002 | ref = harv }} [https://web.psy.otago.ac.nz/pdfs/Ted%27s%20PDF%27s/2002ChiDev.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as findings showing that deaf children who have hearing parents and may not be able to communicate with their parents much during early years of development tend to score lower on theory of mind tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woolfe | first1 = Tyron | last2 = Want | first2 = Stephen C. | last3 = Siegal | first3 = Michael | title = Signposts to development: theory of mind in deaf children | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 768&amp;ndash;778 | doi =  10.1111/1467-8624.00437| date = May–June 2002 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.70.4337 }} [http://www.tyronwoolfe.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Signposts_Child_Development.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation of the relationship between language and theory of mind development has to do with a child's understanding of mental state words such as "''think''" and "''believe''". Since a mental state is not something that one can observe from behavior, children must learn the meanings of words denoting mental states from verbal explanations alone, requiring knowledge of the syntactic rules, semantic systems, and pragmatics of a language.&lt;ref name="Miller child" /&gt; Studies have shown that understanding of these mental state words predicts theory of mind in four-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Chris | last2 = Pure | first2 = Kiran | last3 = Furrow | first3 = David | title = Children's understanding of the modal expression of speaker certainty and uncertainty and its relation to the development of a representational theory of mind | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 722&amp;ndash;730 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02815.x | pmid = 2364747 | jstor = 1130957 | date = June 1990 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third hypothesis is that the ability to distinguish a whole sentence ("Jimmy thinks the world is flat") from its embedded complement ("the world is flat") and understand that one can be true while the other can be false is related to theory of mind development. Recognizing these sentential complements as being independent of one another is a relatively complex syntactic skill and has been shown to be related to increased scores on theory of mind tasks in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Villiers | first1 = Jill G. | last2 = Pyers | first2 = Jennie E.  | title = Complements to cognition: a longitudinal study of the relationship between complex syntax and false-belief-understanding | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1037&amp;ndash;1060 | doi = 10.1016/S0885-2014(02)00073-4 | date = January–March 2002 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these hypotheses, there is also evidence that the neural networks between the areas of the brain responsible for language and theory of mind are closely connected. The temporoparietal junction has been shown to be involved in the ability to acquire new vocabulary, as well as perceive and reproduce words. The temporoparietal junction also contains areas that specialize in recognizing faces, voices, and biological motion, in addition to theory of mind. Since all of these areas are located so closely together, it is reasonable to conclude that they work together. Moreover, studies have reported an increase in activity in the TPJ when patients are absorbing information through reading or images regarding other peoples' beliefs but not while observing information about physical control stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saxe|first=R|author2=Kanwisher, N |title=People thinking about thinking people.

=== Aging ===
In older age, theory of mind capacities decline, irrespective of how exactly they are tested (e.g. stories, eyes, videos, false belief-video, false belief-other, faux pas).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henry|first=Julie D.|last2=Phillips|first2=Louise H.|last3=Ruffman|first3=Ted|last4=Bailey|first4=Phoebe E.|title=A meta-analytic review of age differences in theory of mind.|journal=Psychology and Aging|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=826–839|doi=10.1037/a0030677|pmid=23276217|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the decline in other cognitive functions is even stronger, suggesting that social cognition is somewhat preserved. In contrast to theory of mind, empathy shows no impairments in aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Andrea M. F.|last2=Kanske|first2=Philipp|last3=Eppinger|first3=Ben|last4=Li|first4=Shu-Chen|date=2017-09-08|title=The Aging of the Social Mind - Differential Effects on Components of Social Understanding|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-10669-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|pages=11046|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-10669-4|pmid=28887491|pmc=5591220|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2017NatSR...711046R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two kinds of theory of mind representations: cognitive (concerning the mental states, beliefs, thoughts, and intentions of others) and affective (concerning the emotions of others). Cognitive theory of mind is further separated into first order (e.g., I think she thinks that…) and second order (e.g., he thinks that she thinks that…). There is evidence that cognitive and affective theory of mind processes are functionally independent from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Kalbe |first= Elke |year= 2010 |title= Dissociating Cognitive from Affective Theory of Mind: A TMS Study |url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945209002184 |journal= Cortex |volume= 46 |issue=6 |pages= 769–780 |doi= 10.1016/j.cortex.2009.07.010 |pmid= 19709653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies of Alzheimer’s disease, which typically occurs in older adults, the patients display impairment with second order cognitive theory of mind, but usually not with first order cognitive or affective theory of mind. However, it is difficult to discern a clear pattern of theory of mind variation due to age. There have been many discrepancies in the data collected thus far, likely due to small sample sizes and the use of different tasks that only explore one aspect of theory of mind. Many researchers suggest that the theory of mind impairment is simply due to the normal decline in cognitive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Duval | first = Céline | year = 2011 | title = Age Effects on Different Components of Theory of Mind | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381001000245X | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–642 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.10.025  | pmid = 21111637 | last2 = Piolino | first2 = Pascale | last3 = Benjanin | first3 = Alexandre | last4 = Eustache | first4 = Francis | last5 = Desgranges | first5 = Béatrice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural variations ===
Researchers have proposed that five key aspects of theory of mind develop sequentially for all children between the ages of three to five.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wellman|first=Henry M.|last2=Liu|first2=David|date=2004-03-01|title=Scaling of Theory-of-Mind Tasks|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=75|issue=2|pages=523–541|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00691.x|pmid=15056204|issn=1467-8624}}&lt;/ref&gt; This five-step theory of mind scale consists of the development of diverse desires (DD), diverse beliefs (DB), knowledge access (KA), false beliefs (FB), and hidden emotions (HE).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Australian, American and European children acquire theory of mind in this exact order,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shahaeian|first=Ameneh|last2=Peterson|first2=Candida C.|last3=Slaughter|first3=Virginia|last4=Wellman|first4=Henry M.|title=Culture and the sequence of steps in theory of mind development.|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=47|issue=5|pages=1239–1247|doi=10.1037/a0023899|pmid=21639620|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studies with children in Canada, India, Peru, Samoa, and Thailand indicate that they all pass the false belief task at around the same time, suggesting that the children develop theory of mind consistently around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Callaghan, T., Rochat, P., Lillard, A., Claux, M. L., Odden, H., Itakura, S., ... &amp; Singh, S. (2005). Synchrony in the onset of mental-state reasoning: Evidence from five cultures. ''Psychological Science'', ''16''(5), 378-384.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, children from [[Iran]] and [[China]] develop theory of mind in a slightly different order. Although they begin the development of theory of mind around the same time, toddlers from these countries understand knowledge access (KA) before Western children but take longer to understand false beliefs (FB).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, H. M., Fang, F., Liu, D., Zhu, L., &amp; Liu, G. (2006). Scaling of Theory-of-Mind Understandings in Chinese Children. ''Psychological Science'', ''17''(12), 1075–1081. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01830.x&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers believe this swap in the developmental order is related to the culture of [[collectivism]] in Iran and China, which emphasizes interdependence and shared knowledge as opposed to the culture of [[individualism]] in Western countries, which promotes individuality and conflicting opinions. Because of these different cultural values, Iranian and Chinese children might take longer to understand that other people have different, sometimes false, beliefs. This suggests that the development of theory of mind is not universal and solely determined by innate brain processes but also influenced by social and cultural factors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Empirical investigation==
Whether children younger than 3 or 4 years old may have any theory of mind is a topic of debate among researchers. It is a challenging question, due to the difficulty of assessing what pre-linguistic children understand about others and the world.  Tasks used in research into the development of Theory of Mind must take into account the ''[[umwelt]]''—(the German word ''Umwelt'' means "environment" or "surrounding world")—of the pre-verbal child.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}

=== False-belief task ===
One of the most important milestones in theory of mind development is gaining the ability to attribute ''false belief'': that is, to recognize that others can have beliefs about the world that are diverging. To do this, it is suggested, one must understand how knowledge is formed, that people's beliefs are based on their knowledge, that mental states can differ from reality, and that people's behavior can be predicted by their mental states. Numerous versions of the false-belief task have been developed, based on the initial task done by Wimmer and Perner (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = H. | last2 = Perner | first2 = J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: Representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–128 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most common version of the false-belief task (often called the [[Sally–Anne test|"'Sally-Anne' test"]] or "'Sally-Anne' task"), children are told or shown a story involving two characters. For example, the child is shown two dolls, Sally and Anne, who have a basket and a box, respectively. Sally also has a marble, which she places into her basket, and then leaves the room. While she is out of the room, Anne takes the marble from the basket and puts it into the box. Sally returns, and the child is then asked where Sally will look for the marble. The child passes the task if she answers that Sally will look in the basket, where Sally put the marble; the child fails the task if she answers that Sally will look in the box, where the child knows the marble is hidden, even though Sally cannot know this, since she did not see it hidden there. To pass the task, the child must be able to understand that another's mental representation of the situation is different from their own, and the child must be able to predict behavior based on that understanding.&lt;br /&gt;
Another example is when a boy leaves chocolate on a shelf and then leaves the room. His mother puts it in the fridge. To pass the task, the child must understand that the boy, upon returning, holds the false belief that his chocolate is still on the shelf.&lt;ref name = Mitchell&gt;{{citation | last = Mitchell | first = Peter | contribution =  Acquiring a theory of mind | editor-last1 = Slater | editor-first1 = Alan | editor-last2 = Bremner | editor-first2 = J.

The results of research using false-belief tasks have been fairly consistent: most normally developing children are able to pass the tasks from around age four.&lt;ref name="Roessler, Johannes "&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roessler, Johannes |title=When the Wrong Answer Makes Perfect Sense - How the Beliefs of Children Interact With Their Understanding of Competition, Goals and the Intention of Others |journal=University of Warwick Knowledge Centre |volume=August 2014 |year=2013 |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/knowledge/culture/when-the-wrong-answer-makes-perfect-sense-how-the-beliefs-of-children-interact-with-their-understanding-of-competition-goals-and-the-intention-of-others | accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, while most children, including those with [[Down syndrome]], are able to pass this test, in one study, 80% of children diagnosed with [[autism]] were ''unable'' to do so.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, Frith"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | ref = harv }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20%26%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also adults can experience problems with false beliefs. For instance, when they show [[hindsight bias]], defined as: "the inclination to see events that have already happened as being more predictable than they were before they took place."&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, P. (2011). Acquiring a Theory of Mind. In Alan Slater, &amp; Gavin Bremner (eds.) An Introduction to Developmental Psychology: Second Edition, BPS Blackwell. page 371&lt;/ref&gt; In an experiment by Fischhoff in 1975, adult subjects who were asked for an independent assessment were unable to disregard information on actual outcome. Also in experiments with complicated situations, when assessing others' thinking, adults can be unable to disregard certain information that they have been given.&lt;ref name = Mitchell/&gt;

===Unexpected contents===
Other tasks have been developed to try to solve the problems inherent in the false-belief task. In the "Unexpected contents", or "Smarties" task, experimenters ask children what they believe to be the contents of a box that looks as though it holds a candy called "[[Smarties]]". After the child guesses (usually) "Smarties", it is shown that the box in fact contained pencils. The experimenter then re-closes the box and asks the child what she thinks another person, who has not been shown the true contents of the box, will think is inside. The child passes the task if he/she responds that another person will think that "Smarties" exist in the box, but fails the task if she responds that another person will think that the box contains pencils. Gopnik &amp; Astington (1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Child Development |year=1988 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=26–37 |doi=10.2307/1130386 |pmid=3342716 |vauthors=Gopnik A, Aslington JW |title=Children's understanding of representational change and its relation to the understanding of false belief and the appearance-reality distinction. }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children pass this test at age four or five years.

===Other tasks===
The "false-photograph" task&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zaitchik | first1 = D. | year = 1990 | title = When representations conflict with reality: the preschooler's problem with false beliefs and "false" photographs | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 41–68 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(90)90036-J | pmid = 2340712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leslie | first1 = A. | last2 = Thaiss | first2 = L. | year = 1992 | title = Domain specificity in conceptual development | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 225–51 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(92)90013-8 | pmid = 1643814 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is another task that serves as a measure of theory of mind development. In this task, children must reason about what is represented in a photograph that differs from the current state of affairs.  Within the false-photograph task, either a location or identity change exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sabbagh | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Moses | first2 = L.J. | year = 2006 | title = Executive functioning and preschoolers' understanding of false beliefs, false photographs, and false signs | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 77 | issue = 4| pages = 1034–1049 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00917.x | pmid = 16942504 | last3 = Shiverick | first3 = S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the location-change task, the examiner puts an object in one location (''e.g.'', chocolate in an open green cupboard), whereupon the child takes a Polaroid photograph of the scene.  While the photograph is developing, the examiner moves the object to a different location (''e.g.'', a blue cupboard), allowing the child to view the examiner's action.  The examiner asks the child two control questions: "When we first took the picture, where was the object?" and "Where is the object now?".  The subject is also asked a "false-photograph" question: "Where is the object in the picture?" The child passes the task if he/she correctly identifies the location of the object in the picture and the actual location of the object at the time of the question. However, the last question might be misinterpreted as: "Where in this room is the object that the picture depicts?" and therefore some examiners use an alternative phrasing.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

To make it easier for animals, young children, and individuals with classical (Kanner-type) autism to understand and perform theory of mind tasks, researchers have developed tests in which verbal communication is de-emphasized:  some whose administration does not involve verbal communication on the part of the examiner, some whose successful completion does not require verbal communication on the part of the subject, and some that meet both of the foregoing standards.  One category of tasks uses a preferential looking paradigm, with [[looking time]] as the dependent variable. For instance, 9-month-old infants prefer looking at behaviors performed by a human hand over those made by an inanimate hand-like object.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Infants selectively encode the goal object of an actor's reach, Cognition (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Other paradigms look at rates of imitative behavior, the ability to replicate and complete unfinished goal-directed acts,&lt;ref name="Meltzoff, A. 1995"/&gt; and rates of pretend play.&lt;ref name="Leslie, A. M. 1991 pp. 63-77"&gt;Leslie, A. M. (1991). Theory of mind impairment in autism. In A.

===Early precursors===
Recent research on the early precursors of theory of mind has looked at innovative ways at capturing preverbal infants' understanding of other people's mental states, including perception and beliefs. Using a variety of experimental procedures, studies have shown that infants from their first year of life have an implicit understanding of what other people see&lt;ref name="Poulin-Dubois, D., Sodian, B., Tilden, J., Metz, U., &amp; Schoepper, B. 2007 pp 401-425"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15248370701612951 |title=Out of Sight is Not Out of Mind: Developmental Changes in Infants' Understanding of Visual Perception During the Second Year |year=2007 |last1=Poulin-Dubois |first1=Diane |last2=Sodian |first2=Beate |last3=Metz |first3=Ulrike |last4=Tilden |first4=Joanne |last5=Schoeppner |first5=Barbara |journal=Journal of Cognition and Development |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=401–425}}&lt;/ref&gt; and what they know.&lt;ref name="Onishi, K. H., &amp; Baillargeon, R. 2005 pp. 255-258"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1107621 |title=Do 15-Month-Old Infants Understand False Beliefs? |year=2005 |last1=Onishi |first1=K.

Therefore, their looking-times measures would give researchers an indication of what infants might be inferring, or their implicit understanding of events. One recent study using this paradigm found that 16-month-olds tend to attribute beliefs to a person whose visual perception was previously witnessed as being "reliable", compared to someone whose visual perception was "unreliable". Specifically, 16-month-olds were trained to expect a person's excited vocalization and gaze into a container to be associated with finding a toy in the reliable-looker condition or an absence of a toy in the unreliable-looker condition. Following this training phase, infants witnessed, in an object-search task, the same persons either searching for a toy in the correct or incorrect location after they both witnessed the location of where the toy was hidden. Infants who experienced the reliable looker were surprised and therefore looked longer when the person searched for the toy in the incorrect location compared to the correct location. In contrast, the looking time for infants who experienced the unreliable looker did not differ for either search locations. These findings suggest that 16-month-old infants can differentially attribute beliefs about a toy's location based on the person's prior record of visual perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0016715 |title=The effect of a looker's past reliability on infants' reasoning about beliefs |year=2009 |last1=Poulin-Dubois |first1=Diane |last2=Chow |first2=Virginia |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1576–82 |pmid=19899915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deficits==
The theory of mind impairment describes a difficulty someone would have with perspective-taking. This is also sometimes referred to as ''[[mind-blindness]]''. This means that individuals with a theory of mind impairment would have a difficult time seeing phenomena from any other perspective than their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Moore, S.| year = 2002 | title = Asperger Syndrome and the Elementary School Experience | publisher = Shawnee Mission, KS: Autism Asperger Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who experience a theory of mind deficit have difficulty determining the intentions of others, lack understanding of how their behavior affects others, and have a difficult time with social reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Baker, J.| year = 2003 | title = Social Skills Training: for children and adolescents with Asperger Syndrome and Social-Communication Problems | publisher = Mission, KS: Autism Asperger Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of Mind deficits have been observed in people with [[autism spectrum]] disorders, people with [[schizophrenia]], people with [[nonverbal learning disorder]], people with [[attention deficit disorder]],&lt;ref name="pmid21289541"/&gt; persons under the influence of alcohol and narcotics, sleep-deprived persons, and persons who are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain. Theory of mind deficits have also been observed in deaf children who are late signers (i.e., are born to hearing parents), but the deficit is due to the delay in language learning, not any cognitive deficit, and therefore disappears once the child learns sign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Peterson | first = Candida | year = 2016 | title = Peer Social Skills and Theory of Mind in Children with Autism, Deafness, or Typical Development | url = http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=b9cdfd9c-d261-4e85-97bb-bd48f2a9b7bd%40sessionmgr4007 | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–57 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1037/a0039833 | pmid = 26524383 | last2 = Slaughter | first2 = Virginia | last3 = Moore | first3 = Chris | last4 = Wellman | first4 = Henry }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
In 1985 [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], [[Alan M. Leslie]] and [[Uta Frith]] suggested that children with [[autism]] do not employ theory of mind&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, Frith"/&gt; and suggested that autistic children have particular difficulties with tasks requiring the child to understand another person's beliefs. These difficulties persist when children are matched for verbal skills&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The role of age and verbal ability in the theory of mind task performance of subjects with autism | author=Happe, FG | journal=Child Development | year=1995 | volume=66 | issue=3 | pages=843–55 | doi=10.2307/1131954 | pmid=7789204| jstor=1131954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been taken as a key feature of autism.

Many individuals classified as autistic have severe difficulty assigning mental states to others, and they seem to lack theory of mind capabilities.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991"&gt;{{citation | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon | contribution = Precursors to a theory of mind: Understanding attention in others | editor-last = Whiten | editor-first = Andrew | title = Natural theories of mind: Evolution, development, and simulation of everyday mindreading | pages = 233&amp;ndash;251 | publisher = Basil Blackwell | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780631171942 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers who study the relationship between autism and theory of mind attempt to explain the connection in a variety of ways. One account assumes that theory of mind plays a role in the attribution of mental states to others and in childhood pretend play.&lt;ref name=Leslie&gt;{{citation | last = Leslie | first = Alan M. | contribution = Theory of mind impairment in autism | editor-last = Whiten | editor-first = Andrew | title = Natural theories of mind: Evolution, development, and simulation of everyday mindreading | publisher = Basil Blackwell | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780631171942 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leslie,&lt;ref name=Leslie/&gt; theory of mind is the capacity to mentally represent thoughts, beliefs, and desires, regardless of whether or not the circumstances involved are real. This might explain why some autistic individuals show extreme deficits in both theory of mind and pretend play. However, Hobson proposes a social-affective justification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hobson | first = R.P. | title = Autism and the development of mind | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | location = Hillsdale, N.J. | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780863772399}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that with an autistic person, deficits in theory of mind result from a distortion in understanding and responding to emotions.  He suggests that typically developing human beings, unlike autistic individuals, are born with a set of skills (such as social referencing ability) that later lets them comprehend and react to other people's feelings.  Other scholars emphasize that autism involves a specific developmental delay, so that autistic children vary in their deficiencies, because they experience difficulty in different stages of growth. Very early setbacks can alter proper advancement of joint-attention behaviors, which may lead to a failure to form a full theory of mind.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991"/&gt;

It has been speculated&lt;ref name="Leslie, A. M. 1991 pp. 63-77"/&gt; that Theory of Mind exists on a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] as opposed to the traditional view of a discrete presence or absence. While some research has suggested that some autistic populations are unable to attribute mental states to others,&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251"/&gt; recent evidence points to the possibility of coping mechanisms that facilitate a spectrum of mindful behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dapretto | first1 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Understanding emotions in others: mirror neuron dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 28–30 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1038/nn1611 | pmid = 16327784 | last2 = Davies | first2 = MS | last3 = Pfeifer | first3 = JH | last4 = Scott | first4 = AA | last5 = Sigman | first5 = M | last6 = Bookheimer | first6 = SY | last7 = Iacoboni | first7 = M | pmc = 3713227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tine et al. suggest that [[autistic]] children score substantially lower on measures of social theory of mind in comparison to  children diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2012/505393 |pmid=22934174 |pmc=3420603 |title=Unique Theory of Mind Differentiation in Children with Autism and Asperger Syndrome |year=2012 |last1=Tine |first1=Michele |last2=Lucariello |first2=Joan |journal=Autism Research and Treatment |volume=2012 |pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, children with more advanced theory of mind abilities display more advanced social skills, greater adaptability to new situations, and greater cooperation with others. As a result, these children are typically well-liked. However, “children may use their mind-reading abilities to manipulate, outwit, tease, or trick their peers”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Astington | first = J. W. | year = 2003 | title = Sometimes necessary, never sufficient: False-belief understanding and social competence | journal = Individual Differences in Theory of Mind: Implications for Typical and Atypical Development | pages = 13–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals possessing inferior theory of mind skills, such as children with autism spectrum disorder, may be socially rejected by their peers since they are unable communicate effectively. Social rejection has been proven to negatively impact a child’s development and can put the child at greater risk of developing depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Chung | first = K. | year = 2007 | title = Peer-mediated social skills training program for young children with high-functioning autism | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 423–436 | doi = 10.1016/j.ridd.2006.05.002 | pmid = 16901676 | last2 = Reavis | first2 = S. | last3 = Mosconi | first3 = M. | last4 = Drewry | first4 = J. | last5 = Matthews | first5 = T. | last6 = Tassé | first6 = M. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer-mediated interventions (PMI) are a school-based treatment approach for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder in which peers are trained to be role models in order to promote social behavior. Laghi et al. studied if analysis of prosocial (nice) and antisocial (nasty) theory of mind behaviors could be used, in addition to teacher recommendations, to select appropriate candidates for PMI programs. Selecting children with advanced theory of mind skills who use them in prosocial ways will theoretically make the program more effective. While the results indicated that analyzing the social uses of theory of mind of possible candidates for a PMI program is invaluable, it may not be a good predictor of a candidate's performance as a role model.&lt;ref name="Laghi 2016 207–216"/&gt;

The autistic deficit in Theory of Mind has been challenged by some, who cite both insufficient evidence and contradictory evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vera|first=F|title=Illusions of Explanation: A Critical Review of the "Theory of Mind" Account of Autism|url=https://www.academia.edu/11175559|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ariane-zurcher/autism-theory_b_1594706.html|title=Debunking the Theory of Mind|last=Zurcher|first=Ariane|date=2012-06-18|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate theory of apparent Theory of Mind deficits comes out of the [[social model of disability]], and posits that such deficits are a result of autistic individuals' status as a neurological minority, and the challenges that result from having to model the typical (non-spectrum) mind against their own, resulting in deficits compared with a typical mind modeling another typical mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://semioticspectrumite.wordpress.com/2018/01/26/the-belief-in-theory-of-mind-is-a-disability/|title=The belief in a theory of mind is a disability|date=2018-01-26|work=Semiotic Spectrumite|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schizophrenia===
Individuals with the diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] can show deficits in theory of mind. Mirjam Sprong and colleagues investigated the impairment by examining 29 different studies, with a total of over 1500 participants.&lt;ref name=Sprong&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sprong | first1 = M. | last2 = Schothorst | first2 = P. | last3 = Vos | first3 = E. | last4 = Hox | first4 = J. | last5 = Van Engeland | first5 = H. | year = 2007 | title = Theory of mind in schizophrenia | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 191 | issue = 1| pages = 5–13 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.107.035899 | pmid = 17602119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[meta-analysis]] showed significant and stable deficit of theory of mind in people with schizophrenia. They performed poorly on false-belief tasks, which test the ability to understand that others can hold false beliefs about events in the world, and also on intention-inference tasks, which assess the ability to infer a character's intention from reading a short story. Schizophrenia patients with [[negative symptoms]], such as lack of emotion, motivation, or speech, have the most impairment in theory of mind and are unable to represent the mental states of themselves and of others. Paranoid schizophrenic patients also perform poorly because they have difficulty accurately interpreting others' intentions. The meta-analysis additionally showed that IQ, gender, and age of the participants does not significantly affect the performance of theory of mind tasks.&lt;ref name=Sprong /&gt;

Current research suggests that impairment in theory of mind negatively affects clinical insight, the patient's awareness of their mental illness.&lt;ref name=Ng&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ng | first1 = R. | last2 = Fish | first2 = S. | last3 = Granholm | first3 = E. | year = 2015 | title = Insight and theory of mind in schizophrenia | url = | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 225 | issue = 1–2| pages = 169–174 | doi = 10.1016/j.psychres.2014.11.010 | pmid = 25467703 | pmc=4269286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insight requires theory of mind—a patient must be able to adopt a third-person perspective and see the self as others do.&lt;ref name=Konstan&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Konstantakopoulos | first1 = G. | last2 = Ploumpidis | first2 = D. | last3 = Oulis | first3 = P. | last4 = Patrikelis | first4 = P. | last5 = Nikitopoulou | first5 = S. | last6 = Papadimitriou | first6 = G. N. | last7 = David | first7 = A. S. | year = 2014 | title = The relationship between insight and theory of mind in schizophrenia | url = | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 152 | issue = 1| pages = 217–222 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2013.11.022 | pmid = 24321712 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A patient with good insight would be able to accurately self-represent, by comparing oneself with others and by viewing oneself from the perspective of others.&lt;ref name=Ng /&gt; Insight allows a patient to recognize and react appropriately to his symptoms; however, a patient who lacks insight would not realize that he has a mental illness, because of his inability to accurately self-represent. Therapies that teach patients perspective-taking and self-reflection skills can improve abilities in reading social cues and taking the perspective of another person.&lt;ref name=Ng /&gt;

The majority of the current literature supports the argument that the theory of mind deficit is a stable trait-characteristic rather than a state-characteristic of schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=Cassetta&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cassetta | first1 = B. | last2 = Goghari | first2 = V. | year = 2014 | title = Theory of mind reasoning in schizophrenia patients and non-psychotic relatives | url = | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 218 | issue = 1–2| pages = 12–19 | doi = 10.1016/j.psychres.2014.03.043 | pmid = 24745472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-analysis conducted by Sprong et al. showed that patients in remission still had impairment in theory of mind. The results indicate that the deficit is not merely a consequence of the active phase of schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=Sprong /&gt;

Schizophrenic patients' deficit in theory of mind impairs their daily interactions with others. An example of a disrupted interaction is one between a schizophrenic parent and a child. Theory of mind is particularly important for parents, who must understand the thoughts and behaviors of their children and react accordingly. Dysfunctional parenting is associated with deficits in the first-order theory of mind, the ability to understand another person's thoughts, and the second-order theory of mind, the ability to infer what one person thinks about another person's thoughts.&lt;ref name=Mehta&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mehta | first1 = U.

===Alcohol use disorders===
Impairments in theory of mind, as well as other social-cognitive deficits are commonly found in people suffering from [[alcoholism]], due to the [[neurotoxic]] effects of alcohol on the brain, particularly the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="pmid18412750"/&gt;

===Depression and dysphoria===
Individuals in a current [[major depressive episode]], a disorder characterized by social impairment, show deficits in theory of mind decoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = L. | last2 = Harkness | first2 = K.

===Developmental language disorder===
Children diagnosed with [[Developmental language disorder]] (DLD) exhibit much lower scores on reading and writing sections of standardized tests, yet have a normal nonverbal IQ.  These language deficits can be any specific deficits in lexical semantics, syntax, or pragmatics, or a combination of multiple problems. They often exhibit poorer social skills than normally developing children, and seem to have problems decoding beliefs in others. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that children with DLD have substantially lower scores on theory of mind tasks compared to typically developing children.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nilsson | first1 = Kristine Kahr | last2 = de López| first2 = Kristine Jensen | title = Theory of mind in children with specific language impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 87 | issue = 1 | pages = 143&amp;ndash;153 | doi = 10.1111/cdev.12462 | pmid = 26582261 | date = January–February 2016 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This strengthens the claim that language development is related to theory of mind.

==Brain mechanisms==

=== In typically developing humans ===
Research on theory of mind in [[autism]] led to the view that mentalizing abilities are subserved by dedicated mechanisms that can -in some cases- be impaired while general cognitive function remains largely intact.

[[Neuroimaging]] research has supported this view, demonstrating specific brain regions consistently engaged during theory of mind tasks. [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] research on theory of mind, using verbal and pictorial story comprehension tasks, has identified a set of brain regions including the [[prefrontal cortex|medial prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC), and area around posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]] (pSTS), and sometimes [[precuneus]] and [[amygdala]]/[[Brodmann area 38|temporopolar cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)00025-6 |title=Functional imaging of 'theory of mind' |year=2003 |last1=Gallagher |first1=Helen L. |last2=Frith |first2=Christopher D. |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=77–83 |pmid=12584026|citeseerx=10.1.1.319.778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, research on the neural basis of theory of mind has diversified, with separate lines of research focused on the understanding of beliefs, intentions, and more complex properties of [[minds]] such as psychological traits.

Studies from [[Rebecca Saxe]]'s lab at MIT, using a false-belief versus false-photograph task contrast aimed at isolating the mentalizing component of the false-belief task, have very consistently found activation in mPFC, precuneus, and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), right-lateralized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00230-1 |title=People thinking about thinking peopleThe role of the temporo-parietal junction in "theory of mind" |year=2003 |last1=Saxe |first1=R |last2=Kanwisher |first2=N |journal=NeuroImage |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=1835–42 |pmid=12948738|title-link=Temporoparietal junction }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17470910601000446 |title=Reading minds versus following rules: Dissociating theory of mind and executive control in the brain |year=2006 |last1=Saxe |first1=Rebecca |last2=Schulz |first2=Laura E. |last3=Jiang |first3=Yuhong V. |journal=Social Neuroscience |volume=1 |issue=3–4 |pages=284–98 |pmid=18633794|citeseerx=10.1.1.392.1433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, it has been proposed that the right TPJ ([[rTPJ]]) is selectively involved in representing the beliefs of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01768.x |title=It's the Thought That Counts: Specific Brain Regions for One Component of Theory of Mind |year=2006 |last1=Saxe |first1=R. |last2=Powell |first2=L. J. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=692–9 |pmid=16913952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some debate exists, as some scientists have noted that the same rTPJ region has been consistently activated during spatial reorienting of visual attention;&lt;ref name=DecLamm&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1073858407304654 |title=The Role of the Right Temporoparietal Junction in Social Interaction: How Low-Level Computational Processes Contribute to Meta-Cognition |year=2007 |last1=Decety |first1=J. |last2=Lamm |first2=C. |journal=The Neuroscientist |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=580–93 |pmid=17911216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhm051 |title=Activity in Right Temporo-Parietal Junction is Not Selective for Theory-of-Mind |year=2007 |last1=Mitchell |first1=J. P. |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=262–71 |pmid=17551089}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Decety]] from the University of Chicago and Jason Mitchell from Harvard have thus proposed that the rTPJ subserves a more general function involved in both false-belief understanding and attentional reorienting, rather than a mechanism specialized for social cognition. However, it is possible that the observation of overlapping regions for representing beliefs and attentional reorienting may simply be due to adjacent, but distinct, neuronal populations that code for each. The resolution of typical fMRI studies may not be good enough to show that distinct/adjacent neuronal populations code for each of these processes. In a study following Decety and Mitchell, Saxe and colleagues used higher-resolution fMRI and showed that the peak of activation for attentional reorienting is approximately 6-10mm above the peak for representing beliefs. Further corroborating that differing populations of neurons may code for each process, they found no similarity in the patterning of fMRI response across space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004869 |title=Distinct Regions of Right Temporo-Parietal Junction Are Selective for Theory of Mind and Exogenous Attention |year=2009 |editor1-last=Lauwereyns |editor1-first=Jan |last1=Scholz |first1=Jonathan |last2=Triantafyllou |first2=Christina |last3=Whitfield-Gabrieli |first3=Susan |last4=Brown |first4=Emery N. |last5=Saxe |first5=Rebecca |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e4869 |pmid=19290043 |pmc=2653721|bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.4869S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional imaging has also been used to study the detection of mental state information in Heider-Simmel-esque animations of moving geometric shapes, which typical humans automatically perceive as social interactions laden with intention and emotion.  Three studies found remarkably similar patterns of activation during the perception of such animations versus a random or deterministic motion control: mPFC, pSTS, [[fusiform face area]] (FFA), and amygdala were selectively engaged during the Theory of Mind condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/nimg.2000.0612 |title=Movement and Mind: A Functional Imaging Study of Perception and Interpretation of Complex Intentional Movement Patterns |year=2000 |last1=Castelli |first1=Fulvia |last2=Happé |first2=Francesca |last3=Frith |first3=Uta |last4=Frith |first4=Chris |journal=NeuroImage |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=314–25 |pmid=10944414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02643290342000005 |title=Neural Foundations for Understanding Social and Mechanical Concepts |year=2003 |last1=Martin |first1=Alex |last2=Weisberg |first2=Jill |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology |volume=20 |issue=3–6 |pages=575–87 |pmid=16648880 |pmc=1450338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1208 |title=The role of the fusiform face area in social cognition: Implications for the pathobiology of autism |year=2003 |last1=Schultz |first1=R.

The incongruent actions, on the other hand, require further explanation (why would someone twist empty space next to a gear?), and then apparently would demand more processing in the STS.  Note that this region is distinct from the temporo-parietal area activated during false belief tasks.&lt;ref name=Saxe4/&gt;  Also note that pSTS activation in most of the above studies was largely right-lateralized, following the general trend in neuroimaging studies of social cognition and perception. Also right-lateralized are the TPJ activation during false belief tasks, the STS response to biological motion, and the FFA response to faces.

[[neuropsychology|Neuropsychological]] evidence has provided support for neuroimaging results regarding the neural basis of theory of mind.  Studies with patients suffering from a lesion of the [[frontal lobes]] and the [[temporoparietal junction]] of the brain (between the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]]) reported that they have difficulty with some theory of mind tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rowe|first1=Andrea D|last2=Bullock|first2=Peter R|last3=Polkey|first3=Charles E|last4=Morris|first4=Robin G|title='Theory of mind' impairments and their relationship to executive functioning following frontal lobe excisions|journal=Brain|date=2001|volume=124|issue=3|pages=600–616|doi=10.1093/brain/124.3.600|pmid=11222459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn1223 |title=Left temporoparietal junction is necessary for representing someone else's belief |year=2004 |last1=Samson |first1=Dana |last2=Apperly |first2=Ian A |last3=Chiavarino |first3=Claudia |last4=Humphreys |first4=Glyn W |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=499–500 |pmid=15077111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This shows that theory of mind abilities are associated with specific parts of the human brain.

Research by [[Vittorio Gallese]], Luciano Fadiga and [[Giacomo Rizzolatti]] (reviewed in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230 |title=The Mirror-Neuron System |year=2004 |last1=Rizzolatti |first1=Giacomo |last2=Craighero |first2=Laila |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |volume=27 |pages=169–92 |pmid=15217330 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has shown that some sensorimotor [[neuron]]s, which are referred to as [[mirror neuron]]s, first discovered in the [[premotor cortex]] of [[rhesus monkey]]s, may be involved in action understanding.  Single-electrode recording revealed that these neurons fired when a monkey performed an action, as well as when the monkey viewed another agent carrying out the same task.  Similarly, [[fMRI]] studies with human participants have shown brain regions (assumed to contain mirror neurons) that are active when one person sees another person's goal-directed action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030079 |title=Grasping the Intentions of Others with One's Own Mirror Neuron System |year=2005 |last1=Iacoboni |first1=Marco |last2=Molnar-Szakacs |first2=Istvan |last3=Gallese |first3=Vittorio |last4=Buccino |first4=Giovanni |last5=Mazziotta |first5=John C. |last6=Rizzolatti |first6=Giacomo |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=e79 |pmid=15736981 |pmc=1044835}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These data have led some authors to suggest that mirror neurons may provide the basis for theory of mind in the brain, and to support simulation theory of mind reading (see above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01262-5 |title=Mirror neurons and the simulation theory of mind-reading |year=1998 |last1=Gallese |first1=V |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=493–501 |pmid=21227300 |last2=Goldman |first2=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence against the link between mirror neurons and theory of mind.  First, [[macaque|macaque monkeys]] have mirror neurons but do not seem to have a 'human-like' capacity to understand theory of mind and belief.  Second, [[fMRI]] studies of theory of mind typically report activation in the mPFC, temporal poles and TPJ or STS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1218 |title=Development and neurophysiology of mentalizing |year=2003 |last1=Frith |first1=U. |last2=Frith |first2=C.

Some investigators, like developmental psychologist [[Andrew Meltzoff]] and neuroscientist [[Jean Decety]], believe that mirror neurons merely facilitate learning through imitation and may provide a precursor to the development of Theory of Mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1261 |title=What imitation tells us about social cognition: A rapprochement between developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience |year=2003 |last1=Meltzoff |first1=A.

In a recent paper, [[Keren Haroush]] and [[Ziv Williams]] outlined the case for a group of [[neuron]]s in primates' brains that uniquely predicted the choice selection of their interacting partner. These primates' neurons, located in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] of rhesus monkeys, were observed using single-unit recording while the monkeys played a variant of the iterative [[prisoner's dilemma]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haroush K, Williams Z |year=2015 |title=Neuronal Prediction of Opponent's Behavior during Cooperative Social Interchange in Primates |journal=Cell |volume=160 |issue=6 |pages=1233–1245 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.01.045 |pmid=25728667 |pmc=4364450}}&lt;/ref&gt; By identifying cells that represent the yet unknown intentions of a game partner, Haroush &amp; Williams' study supports the idea that theory of mind may be a fundamental and generalized process, and suggests that ''[[anterior cingulate cortex]]'' neurons may potentially act to complement the function of mirror neurons during [[social interchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sanfey AG, Civai C, Vavra P |year=2015 |title=Predicting the other in cooperative interactions |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661315001217 |journal=Trends Cogn.

===In autism===
Several neuroimaging studies have looked at the neural basis theory of mind impairment in subjects with [[Asperger syndrome]] and [[high-functioning autism]] (HFA).  The first PET study of theory of mind in autism (also the first neuroimaging study using a task-induced activation paradigm in autism) replicated a prior study in normal individuals, which employed a story-comprehension task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Happe  | year = 1996 | title = 'Theory of mind' in the brain.

However, because the study used only six subjects with autism, and because the spatial resolution of PET imaging is relatively poor, these results should be considered preliminary.

A subsequent fMRI study scanned normally developing adults and adults with HFA while performing a "reading the mind in the eyes" task: viewing a photo of a human's eyes and choosing which of two adjectives better describes the person's mental state, versus a gender discrimination control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = et al | title = Social intelligence in the normal and autistic brain: an fMRI study | journal = [[European Journal of Neuroscience]] | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 1891&amp;ndash;1898 | doi = 10.1046/j.1460-9568.1999.00621.x | pmid = 10336657 | date = June 1999 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors found activity in [[orbitofrontal cortex]], STS, and amygdala in normal subjects, and found no amygdala activation and abnormal STS activation in subjects with autism.

A more recent PET study looked at brain activity in individuals with HFA and Asperger syndrome while viewing Heider-Simmel animations (see above) versus a random motion control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Castelli  | year = 2002 | title = Autism, Asperger syndrome and brain mechanisms for the attribution of mental states to animated shapes | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 125 | issue = Pt 8| pages = 1839–1849 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awf189 | pmid = 12135974 | first1 = F | last2 = Frith | first2 = C | last3 = Happé | first3 = F | last4 = Frith | first4 = U }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to normally developing subjects, those with autism showed no STS or FFA activation, and significantly less mPFC and amygdala activation.  Activity in [[extrastriate cortex|extrastriate regions]] V3 and LO was identical across the two groups, suggesting intact lower-level visual processing in the subjects with autism.  The study also reported significantly less functional connectivity between STS and V3 in the autism group.  Note, however, that decreased temporal correlation between activity in STS and V3 would be expected simply from the lack of an evoked response in STS to intent-laden animations in subjects with autism. A more informative analysis would be to compute functional connectivity after regressing out evoked responses from all-time series.

A subsequent study, using the incongruent/congruent gaze-shift paradigm described above, found that in high-functioning adults with autism, posterior STS (pSTS) activation was undifferentiated while they watched a human shift gaze toward a target and then toward adjacent empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelphrey  | year = 2005 | title = Neural basis of eye gaze processing deficits in autism | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 128 | issue = Pt 5| pages = 1038–1048 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awh404 | pmid = 15758039 | first1 = KA | last2 = Morris | first2 = JP | last3 = McCarthy | first3 = G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of additional STS processing in the incongruent state may suggest that these subjects fail to form an expectation of what the actor should do given contextual information, or that feedback about the violation of this expectation doesn't reach STS. Both explanations involve an impairment in the ability to link eye gaze shifts with intentional explanations.  This study also found a significant anticorrelation between STS activation in the incongruent-congruent contrast and social subscale score on the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]], but not scores on the other subscales.

In 2011, an fMRI study demonstrated that the right [[temporoparietal junction]] (rTPJ) of higher-functioning adults with autism was not more selectively activated for mentalizing judgments when compared to physical judgments about self and other.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=NeuroImage |year=2011 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=1832–1838 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.067 |pmid=21356316 |vauthors=Lombardo MV, Chakrabarti B, Bullmore ET, MRC AIMS Consortium, Baron-Cohen S |title=Specialization of right temporo-parietal junction for mentalizing and its relation to social impairments in autism }}&lt;/ref&gt;  rTPJ selectivity for mentalizing was also related to individual variation on clinical measures of social impairment: individuals whose rTPJ was increasingly more active for mentalizing compared to physical judgments were less socially impaired, while those who showed little to no difference in response to mentalizing or physical judgments were the most socially impaired. This evidence builds on work in typical development that suggests rTPJ is critical for representing mental state information, irrespective of whether it is about oneself or others. It also points to an explanation at the neural level for the pervasive [[mind-blindness]] difficulties in autism that are evident throughout the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Science |year=2009 |volume=325 |issue=5942 |pages=883–885 |doi=10.1126/science.1176170 |pmid=19608858 |vauthors=Senju A, Southgate V, White S, Frith U |title=Mindblind eyes: an absence of spontaneous theory of mind in Asperger syndrome }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

The evolutionary origin of theory of mind remains obscure. While many theories make claims about its role in the development of human language and social cognition few of them specify in detail any evolutionary neurophysiological precursors. A recent theory claims that Theory of Mind has its roots in two defensive reactions, namely immobilization stress and tonic immobility, which are implicated in the handling of stressful encounters and also figure prominently in mammalian childrearing practices (Tsoukalas, 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s40806-017-0112-x |title=Theory of Mind: Towards an Evolutionary Theory |year=2018 |last=Tsoukalas |first=Ioannis |journal= Evolutionary Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 38–66}}[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CCwSs2TrvPwwSU8rDyUkvtLYAuYfylMD/view?usp=sharing Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Their combined effect seems capable of producing many of the hallmarks of theory of mind, e.g., eye-contact, gaze-following, inhibitory control and intentional attributions.

==Non-human==
{{see also|Animal consciousness|Theory of mind in animals}}

An open question is if other animals besides humans have a [[genetics|genetic]] endowment and [[social psychology|social]] environment that allows them to acquire a theory of mind in the same way that human children do.&lt;ref name="Premack, D. G. 1978"/&gt; This is a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from [[ethology|animal behavior]] the existence of [[thought|thinking]] or of particular thoughts, or the existence of a concept of [[self (psychology)|self]] or [[self-awareness]], [[consciousness]] and [[qualia]]. One difficulty with non-human studies of Theory of Mind is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.

Non-human research still has a major place in this field, however, and is especially useful in illuminating which nonverbal behaviors signify components of theory of mind, and in pointing to possible stepping points in the evolution of what many claim to be a uniquely human aspect of social cognition. While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities. For example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). Call and Tomasello's study&lt;ref name="Call, J. 1998"/&gt; that looked at understanding of intention in orangutans, chimpanzees and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts. Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, as it is in the nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition. Other studies relevant to attributions theory of mind have been conducted using [[plover]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ristau |first1=Carolyn A. |year=1991 |chapter=Aspects of the cognitive ethology of an injury-feigning bird, the piping plovers |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKzhZYiQfZEC&amp;pg=PA91 |editor1-first=Carolyn A. |editor1-last=Ristau |title=Cognitive Ethology: Essays in Honor of Donald R. Griffin |pages=91–126 |location=Hillsdale, New Jersey |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |isbn=978-1-134-99085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dogs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10071-008-0175-y |title=Attention to attention in domestic dog (Canis familiaris) dyadic play |year=2008 |last1=Horowitz |first1=Alexandra |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=12 |pages=107–18 |pmid=18679727 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have shown preliminary evidence of understanding attention—one precursor of theory of mind—in others.

There has been some controversy over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show theory of mind ability—or inability—in animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00053-6 |title=Chimpanzee minds: Suspiciously human? |year=2003 |last1=Povinelli |first1=Daniel J. |last2=Vonk |first2=Jennifer |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=157–160 |pmid=12691763|citeseerx=10.1.1.494.1478 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples serve as demonstration: first, Povinelli ''et al.'' (1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Povinelli | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = K.E. | last3 = Boysen | first3 = S.T. | year = 1990 | title = Inferences about guessing and knowing by chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 104 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.104.3.203 | pmid = 2225758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented chimpanzees with the choice of two experimenters from whom to request food: one who had seen where food was hidden, and one who, by virtue of one of a variety of mechanisms (having a bucket or bag over his head; a blindfold over his eyes; or being turned away from the baiting) does not know, and can only guess. They found that the animals failed in most cases to differentially request food from the "knower". By contrast, Hare, Call, and Tomasello (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hare | first1 = B. | last2 = Call | first2 = J. | last3 = Tomasello | first3 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Do chimpanzees know what conspecifics know and do not know? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 139–151 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2000.1518 | pmid=11170704}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that subordinate chimpanzees were able to use the knowledge state of dominant rival chimpanzees to determine which container of hidden food they approached. William Field and [[Sue Savage-Rumbaugh]] have no doubt that bonobos have developed Theory of Mind and cite their communications with a well known captive bonobo, [[Kanzi]], as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Jon|title=A Voluble Visit with Two Talking Apes|url=https://www.npr.org/2006/07/08/5503685/a-voluble-visit-with-two-talking-apes|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=8 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2016 experiment, ravens ''[[Corvus corax]]'' were shown to take into account visual access of unseen conspecifics. It is suspected that "ravens can generalize from their own perceptual experience to infer the possibility of being seen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160202/ncomms10506/full/ncomms10506.html | title=Ravens attribute visual access to unseen competitors | author1=Thomas Bugnyar|author2=Stephan A.

A 2016 study published by evolutionary anthropologist Christopher Krupenye brings new light to the existence of Theory of Mind, and particularly false beliefs, in non-human primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6308/110 | title=Great apes anticipate that other individuals will act according to false beliefs | author1=Christopher Krupenye|author2=Fumihiro Kano|author3=Satoshi Hirata|author4=Josep Call|author5=Michael Tomasello | journal=Science | year=2016 | volume=354 | issue=6308 | pages=110–114 | doi=10.1126/science.aaf8110 | pmid=27846501|bibcode=2016Sci...354..110K| hdl=10161/13632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Theosophical Society in America (Hargrove branch)''' was an organization that developed from the [[Theosophical Society]] in America.

In 1895 a division occurred between the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]] and the [[Theosophical Society Pasadena]], leading [[William Quan Judge]] to form a separate organization distinct from the organization mased in Adyar, headed by Annie Besant. After the death of [[William Quan Judge|Judge]], [[Ernest Temple Hargrove]], who was [[William Quan Judge|Judge's]] secretary at the time, found evidence that [[William Quan Judge|Judge]] had intended a successor. In 1898, [[Katherine Tingley]] was elected president of the TSA, with Hargrove's initial support. Hargrove later came to disagree with Tingley, and later broke away with roughly 200 other members to form the Theosophical Society in America. A.H. Spencer and later Hargrove became president of this new organization. The society was oriented towards [[William Quan Judge|WQ Judge's]] principles.  Their headquarters were located in [[New York City]], while [[Katherine Tingley|Tingley]] relocated hers to [[Lomaland]] in [[Point Loma, California]].  In 1906 or 1907 this branch including Hargrove gave [[Robert Crosbie]] a deed of foundation to found a lodge in Los Angeles. Hargrove can thus be seen as an obstetrician to the [[United Lodge of Theosophists]].  The organization was renamed "The Theosophical Society" in 1908.

Original members of this branch included: Dr. [[Archibald Keightley]] and his wife Julia van der Planck (a.k.a. "Jasper Niemand"); Noted Sanskritist [[s:Author:Charles Johnston|Charles Johnston]] and his wife Vera Jelihovsky Johnston, a niece of [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]]; Clement Acton Griscom Jr. and his wife Genevieve Ludlow Griscom (a.k.a. "Cavé"); Henry Bedinger Mitchell and his brother John F. B. Mitchell.  A number of branches of the organization existed throughout North America, as well as several in the UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and Venezuela. The publishing arm of this branch, known as The Quarterly Book Department published a great deal of theosophical literature until the late 1930s.  Their main publication was the journal ''The Theosophical Quarterly'' (1903–1938).  The last issue announces the cessation of publication and the onset of a period of "indrawal" of the society.  Hargrove died in on April 8, 1939.  The last annual convention of this branch was held in New York in 1943, where the members agreed to formally disband and entered into "indrawal".

'''Torah im Derech Eretz''' ({{lang-he-n|תורה עם דרך ארץ}} – [[Torah study|Torah]] with "the way of the land"&lt;ref name="Y Goldson"&gt;Rabbi Y. Goldson, [[Aish HaTorah]]: [http://www.aish.com/sp/pg/48943746.html "The Way of the World", Ethics of the Fathers, 3:21]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] articulated by [[Rabbi]] [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] (1808–88), which formalizes a relationship between traditionally observant Judaism and the modern world. Some refer to the resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism as Neo-Orthodoxy.

==Derech Eretz==
The phrase ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is first found in the [[Mishna]] in Tractate ''[[Avoth]]'' (2:2): "Beautiful is the [[Torah study|study of Torah]] with ''derech eretz'', as involvement with both makes one forget sin". The term ''derech eretz'', literally "the way of the land", is inherently ambiguous, with a wide range of meanings in [[Rabbinic literature]], referring to earning a livelihood and behaving appropriately, among others.&lt;ref name="Y Goldson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Gidon | last = Rothstein | url = http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | title = Maharal on Avot | website = RJConline.org | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031164210/http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | archivedate = 2010-10-31 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appropriate behaviour and good character===
[[Image:Virtue. La Vertu (NYPL b14140320-1638489).jpg|thumb|200px|Personification of virtue - one aspect of Derech im Eretz.]]
In the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]], there are approximately 200 teachings concerning ''derech eretz'' as decent, polite, respectful, thoughtful, and civilized behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Jeff | last = Forsythe | url = http://www.shemayisrael.com/rabbiforsythe/interpersonal/derecheretz.htm | title = Derech Eretz: Civil, Polite and Thoughtful Behavior | publisher = Shema Yisrael}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One representative teaching is that "Derech eretz comes before Torah" (''[[Midrash#Midrash Rabbah|Midrash Vayikra Rabbah]]'' 9:3) – one cannot personify Torah until he demonstrates ''derech eretz'' in everything that he does. There are many more such teachings in the [[rishonim]] and [[acharonim]] (post-Talmudic authorities). The [[mussar literature]], in fact, presents an entire body of thought devoted to the subject of ''middot'' ([[character trait]]s) and "behaving like a ''[[Mensch|mentsh]]''" (refined human being). Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one's ''middot''.

===Earning a livelihood===
[[Image:Lilien Blacksmith.jpg|thumb|200px|A blacksmith at work. Illustration by Ephraim Moshe Lilien.]]
The meaning of ''Derech Eretz'' in the above Mishna is generally taken as "earning a livelihood",&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishnah#Commentaries|Commentary on the Mishna]]'' ''ad loc''&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mishna is thus read as "Beautiful is the study of Torah combined with 'earning a livelihood'". In consonance, Rabbinic opinion has a general requirement for earning a livelihood, but in such a fashion that one may also [[Torah study|study]], and live, Torah;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = M | last = Taubes | url = http://www.tzemachdovid.org/thepracticaltorah/yisro.shtml | title = The value of work | publisher = Tzemach Dovid | series = The Practical Torah | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121014004728/http://www.tzemachdovid.org/thepracticaltorah/yisro.shtml | archivedate = 2012-10-14 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MB_155_156"/&gt; see also [[Nashim|''Kiddushin'']] [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%93_%D7%99%D7%93 4:14].

{{quote|God made one to balance the other||[[Ecclesiastes]] 7:14}}

This opinion, in fact, extends to codification in [[Halakha|Jewish Law]]: "[One] should work every day, sufficient for his living... and should busy himself with Torah the rest of the day and night; one who supports himself with his own hands is on a great level".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Moses Isserles|Rema]]'' on ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', ''[[Yoreh De'ah]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.9B.D7.90 246:21]&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of this codification is representative of the general value assigned by [[Rabbinic literature]] to work in and of itself, and of the simultaneous requirement that work be seen as means to spiritual, and not material, goals.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Kohelet Rabbah]] 1:34; [[Shlomo Ganzfried#Kitzur Shulchan Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]] [http://www.kitzur.net/main.php?siman=31&amp;black=false&amp;nk=1 31:7]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''[[Pirkei Avot]]'' [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2032/jewish/Chapter-Four.htm 4:1]:
{{quote|Who is rich? One who is satisfied with his lot. As is stated (''[[Psalms]]'' 128:2): "If you eat of toil of your hands, fortunate are you, and good is to you"; "fortunate are you" in this world, "and good is to you" in the [[Jewish eschatology#The afterlife and olam haba (the world to come)|World to Come]].}}

This widely quoted Mishna contains both a requirement to work and a warning against [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Menachem Schneerson]], [http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/04-01.htm ''Insights Into Pirkei Avos''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910053740/http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/04-01.htm |date=2007-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rashi]], on the verse, similarly states that one who supports himself inherits this world and the next.

Rabbinic tradition recognizes that achieving an appropriate balance could pose both practical and philosophic challenges (e.g. the requirement for secular education as opposed to limited vocational training), and the various issues are therefore widely discussed – in various tractates in the [[Talmud]] (see [http://e-daf.com/?ID=68 ''Berachot'' 35b]), in the [[Halakha|halakhic]] literature (e.g. ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'': ''[[Yoreh Deah]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95 siman 246],&lt;ref name="Rema_YD246_4"/&gt; ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%95 siman 156];&lt;ref name="MB_155_156"&gt;''[[Mishna Berurah]]'' on simanim [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%94 155] and [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%95 156] states that בעלי בתים (working laymen) should ensure that their business activities are secondary to their Torah study, and, regardless, should set aside 3 or 4 hours each day to study — if required, limiting one's lifestyle such that this amount of study is possible. One should also limit their choice of occupation to one which is free from all גזל ותרמית ("theft and deceit", i.e. ethical and moral challenges); see also [[Nashim|''Kiddushin'']] [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%93_%D7%99%D7%93 Mishna 4:14].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'': [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910345/jewish/Chapter-Five.htm ''Deot'' Ch.5], [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910975/jewish/Chapter-Three.htm ''Talmud Torah'' Ch.3]), as well as in [[Jewish Philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy|Hasidic thought]] and [[musar literature|Musar (ethical) literature]].

===Knowledge of the natural world===
[[Image:Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature CROPPED.jpg|thumb|200px|"Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature". 18th century engraving by William Skelton, symbolizing knowledge of the natural world.]]
[[Maharal]], Judah Loew (1525–1609), points out that ''Derech Eretz'' is not limited to "earning a living"; rather, the concept encompasses ''hanhaga tiv`it'', "operating in the natural world". Here, Maharal in his ''[[Maharal#Works|Derech Chaim]]'' comments on the later [[Mishna]], ''[[Avoth]]'' 3:21,&lt;ref name="Y Goldson"/&gt; which discusses the interdependence of "Torah and flour (''kemakh'')" as well as the interdependence of "Torah and ''Derech Eretz''". ''Kemakh'', flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, ''Derech Eretz'' refers to more than just "earning a livelihood" and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the "world of Nature". See.&lt;ref name="Rema_YD246_4"&gt;[[Moses Isserles|Moshe Isserles (Rema)]] on ''[[Yoreh Deah]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.93 siman 246:4] allows study of שאר החכמות ([http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%97%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA = non-Torah wisdom]), but limits this such that: this study is באקראי (non-fixed, as required, secondary to Torah); and excludes study of  ספרי מינים ("heretical works").&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge of culture and society===
[[Image:Understanding-Reid-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|200px|Understanding, mural by Robert Lewis Reid in Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C.]]
Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] (1808{{spaced ndash}}1888), incorporating the above, was among the first to extend the definition of ''Derech Eretz'' to include a broad knowledge of, and appropriate interaction with, [[Western culture|culture and society]]. Hirsch states that "''Derech Eretz'' includes everything that results from the fact that man's existence, mission and social life is conducted on [[Earth]], using earthly means and conditions. Therefore this term especially describes ways of earning a livelihood and maintaining the social order. It also includes the customs and considerations of [[etiquette]] that the [[social order]] generates as well as everything concerning [[humanities|humanistic]] and civil education" ([[Exegesis|commentary]] on ''[[Avoth]]''). Hirsch's conception also [[entailment|entails]] the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The resultant philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[modern world]], referred to as "''Torah im Derech Eretz''", is discussed below.

==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==
[[Image:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 2007 98 0.jpg|thumb|200px|Samson Raphael Hirsch.]]
When Hirsch first came to [[Frankfurt]] in 1851, he proclaimed ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' as the "banner" for his congregation, the ''Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft '' — the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending ''Derech Eretz'' to include broad knowledge of the [[secular]] world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of ''Derech Eretz'' that incorporated a practical response to [[modernity]]. In Hirsch's view, ''derech eretz'' refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of ''derech eretz'' to embrace [[Western culture]] while maintaining strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (see &lt;ref name="Rema_YD246_4"/&gt; and &lt;ref name="MB_155_156"/&gt;).

===Worldly involvement===
[[Image:Samson Raphael Hirsch. Bernard Drachman. The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel. 1899.pdf|thumb|200px|Cover of an 1899 edition of ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'', where Hirsch lays out his program of Derech im Eretz.]]
Hirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and ''Derech Eretz'' is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of [[Torah]]—''Derech Eretz''—therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.
:"Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel—that is what it means to be a Jew." (''Religion Allied to Progress'')

===Secular culture and education===
In Hirsch's view, Judaism must "include the conscientious promotion of education and culture". Hirsch speaks of the ''Mensch-Yisroel'' ("Israel-man"), the "enlightened religious personality" as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the [[Torah]], but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.
:"The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to [[Tikkun Olam|the salvation of the whole of mankind]], the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man." (''Religion Allied to Progress'')

===Jewish law===
Importantly, Hirsch was very clear that ''Derech Eretz'' in no sense allows for [[halakha|halakhic]] compromise. In his view, Judaism is "an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations" and "progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion". He states that "the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God." In ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'' Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance]].)

==Interpretation==
:''See also the [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|discussion]] on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.''

The philosophy of ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' has been variously interpreted within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch's insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the [[secular]] world.

Under a "narrow interpretation", exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a "median interpretation", this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one's [[mundane|worldly matters]]. Under a "broad interpretation" this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to ― and even a synthesis with ― Torah.

Thus as regards involvement in the secular world, the "narrow interpretation" essentially restricts ''Derech Eretz'' to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The "median interpretation" encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The "broad interpretation" permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.

[[Image:Schiller lesend.jpg|thumb|200px|Interaction with modern culture is one aspect of Torah im Derech Eretz. Hirsch saw a common ground in values exposed by a philosopher like Schiller. The image, by Luise Duttenhofer, depicts Schiller reading.]]
Hirsch himself appears to have embraced the "median interpretation", albeit with the qualifications above. He states that "''Torah im Derech Eretz'', as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vii p.&amp;nbsp;294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his [[Torah]] commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by [[Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Hirsch.html Prof. E. Segal, University of Calgary];[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Hirsch.html Avi Hein, jewishvirtuallibrary.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of [[Western culture]] embodied in Schiller's writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Professor Levi]] points out, however, that Rabbi Hirsch was required to make the speech for "political reasons" and that in this speech Hirsch "did not even hint, not a single word, that the Jewish people had anything at all to learn from [Schiller's] ideas." See [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm הרש"ר הירש כמורה דרך לדורנו (''Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as a guide for our generation'')], section: יהדות על טהרת הקודש&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in [[Germany]] at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to [[Classics|classical languages]]. Famously, in his commentary to [[Leviticus]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919 18:4-5]  (see also [[Rashi]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919/showrashi/true ''ad loc.'']), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is "''ikkar''" (עיקר), the essential, while secular knowledge is "''tefel''" (טפל), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that "[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally".

His [http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol27/v27n149.shtml#01 commentary on] [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970 6:7] is perhaps more explicit:
:"The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah's perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life."

==Neo-Orthodoxy: the "Breuer" communities==
In 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This community soon became the model for "modern communities" strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, "Frankfurter Orthodoxy". Hirsch's son-in-law Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Breuer|Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer]], succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch's son to be his successor.

After [[World War I]], in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves "Neo-Orthodox"; this mirrored the parallel movement in [[Lutheranism]] (called "[[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-Orthodoxy]]"). Thus, at this point, Hirsch's [[Romanticism|romantic liberalism]] and the values of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 struggle for civil rights]] were less relevant – and the rejection of many elements of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar culture|German culture]] was prevalent. [[Solomon Breuer]] and [[Isaac Breuer]] were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Kristallnacht]], Breuer and his family emigrated to [[Antwerp]], and then to [[New York City]]. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, [[Khal Adath Yeshurun]], is colloquially known as "Breuer's". Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]], also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the "Breuer" community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch's intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional [[Lithuania]]n orthodox communities.

The Breuer community has cautiously applied ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' to [[Culture of the United States|American life]], narrowing its application over time.&lt;ref name="Controversial Moments"&gt;In fact, as of 2008 there has been some conflict between leading members of the community as to which direction it should take: see under [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)]] and [http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&amp;mode=a&amp;contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration Controversial Moments At Rav S.R. Hirsch Memorial Celebration, Article by Elliot Resnick, The Jewish Press, Friday, June 27, 2008, p. 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630202518/http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&amp;mode=a&amp;contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration |date=June 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.

Schwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. "[[Torah study]] is the highest duty of the Jew", and "even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral law|Oral Torah]]." Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is "incontestably immoral"). "Carrying on one's professional life in consonance with the ''[[halakha]]'' is in itself a practice of Torah." One must "establish the Torah's primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that 'mundane' portion of his life into a sanctification."

The community is positioned ideologically outside of both [[Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] ("Ultra-Orthodoxy"). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today's ''[[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]'', the "Torah Only" and ''Torah Im Derech Eretz'' camps can exist side-by-side. "As long as one is prompted solely by ''Yiras Shamayim'' ("fear of Heaven") and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow." Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi [[Agudath Yisrael of America]], while it shuns the more modern [[Orthodox Union]].

The movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch's ideas: regarding standards of ''[[halakha]]'' as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|Torah Umadda]]. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]'' (secession), "could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people". For this reason, he was "unalterably opposed to the ''[[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]'' movement, which remained affiliated with the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]".

==Contemporary influence==
''Torah im Derech Eretz'' remains influential as a philosophy in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Although usually associated with the "[[Joseph Breuer|Breuer]]" community of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], the philosophy remains an important influence in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and, to some extent, in ''[[Haredi Judaism]]''. (See also [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]] for discussion of ''derech eretz'' in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)

===Modern Orthodoxy===
''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is a major source of ideology for [[Modern Orthodoxy]], particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the "broad interpretation", although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their "relatively relaxed stance" in ''[[halakha]]'' in fact positions them outside the realm of ''Torah im Derech Eretz''.

Further to the right, the "broad interpretation" is largely identical with ''[[Torah Umadda]]''—Torah and secular knowledge—a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]], which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under ''Torah Umadda'', "[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains..." ([[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943), whereas ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''.

===Neo-Orthodoxy===
As above, the "Breuer" community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since [[World War II]], the community, has moved away from the "median interpretation" toward the "narrow interpretation", as above.&lt;ref name="Controversial Moments"/&gt; Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather's ideas (and confusion with [[Torah Umadda]]) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and ''[[halakha]]'' was at variance with ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. "Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination – for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson). See [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|further]] in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|additionally]] under Modern Orthodoxy.

===Haredi Judaism===
[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Torah im Derech Eretz'' shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system. The second graduating class of the Beis Yaakov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]
Today, the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] "[[Haredi Judaism#United States|Yeshiva communities]]" adhere to the "narrow interpretation" as an educational philosophy. ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the [[Beis Yaakov]] school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in [[Kraków]], [[Sarah Schenirer]] taught Rav Hirsch's writings in [[German language|German]]. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.&lt;ref&gt;Chevroni, M. ''The Contribution of German Chareidim to the New Yishuv''&lt;/ref&gt;) Similarly, the "narrow interpretation" guides the curricula at boys' high schools.

Other Haredi communities, the "Torah only" school, are further distant from ''Torah im Derech Eretz''. Since [[World War II]] there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only—in schools, ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' and ''[[kollel]]s''. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; "to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative".&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Carmell, ''Torah Im Derech Eretz''&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the Hirschian model is seen as ''horaat sha'ah'', a "time specific teaching" intended to apply to the special circumstances of [[Western Europe]] in the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;A strong case can actually be made for the idea that the "Torah only" is in itself a ''horaat sha'ah'' adopted in the wake of the destruction of the major Torah centers during the Holocaust. ([[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Levi]] 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: "''Torah im Derech Eretz'' ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times." (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vi p.&amp;nbsp;221); see further under [[Joseph Breuer]].)

'''Zeena Schreck''' (born '''Zeena Galatea LaVey''', November 19, 1963), known professionally by her [[Mononymous person|mononymous]] artist name '''ZEENA''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Performa-13 Art Exhibit describes Zeena Schreck as "known by her mononymous artist name, ZEENA."|url=http://13.performa-arts.org/event/frank-haines-zeena-schreck}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Berlin]]-based American visual and musical artist, author and the spiritual leader of the Sethian Liberation Movement (SLM), which she founded in 2002.

Raised within her father's organization, the [[Church of Satan]], she came to international prominence early in life as the Church's first [[spokesperson]], defending the organization during the 1980s. In 1990 she resigned her position, severed ties with her father [[Anton LaVey]] and his Church, and renounced the [[LaVeyan Satanism|church's]] [[Dogma|tenets]]. Since that time, her religion changed to [[Buddhism]] and she is now a teacher of [[Vajrayana|Tibetan Tantric Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional description in biography: "She is a practicing Tibetan Buddhist yogini, teaches at the Buddhistische Gesellschaft Berlin"|url=http://13.performa-arts.org/artists/zeena-schreck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beelzebub's Daughter: How Zeena Schreck left the Church of Satan|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yv53ex/beelzebubs-daughter-0000175-v19n4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and family==

Zeena was born in San Francisco, California to [[Anton LaVey]] (April 11, 1930 – October 29, 1997), and [[Diane Hegarty]] (b. July 10, 1942), co-founders of the [[Church of Satan]]. On May 23, 1967, three-year-old Zeena had the first and most highly publicized Satanic baptism in history performed by her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clip of 1989 Sally Jesse Raphael Halloween Show with Zeena Schreck providing a concise explanation of what her Satanic baptism was; begin at 01:40:|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exWUeQ53ICg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.de/license/515036094|title=Editorial &amp; News Images: News Photography, Pictures, Awards, Events, Sports, Celebrity Photos - Getty Images|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony garnered worldwide publicity with a reenactment of the ceremony recorded for ''[[The Satanic Mass]]'' LP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Satanic Mass/Zeena's Baptism Track A9 go to 3:42|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_M09vuLQAc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Satanic Mass, Track A9 (Zeena's Baptism)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Anton-LaVey-The-Satanic-Mass/release/1166426|publisher=Murgenstrumm, 1968 Vinly LP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeena was subjected to hundreds of journalistic reports and interviews especially in tabloid crime and men's magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media coverage of the child Zeena|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=109%3Apress-coverage-of-zeenas-baptism-1967-1968&amp;catid=41&amp;Itemid=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anton LaVey biographer, Burton H. Wolf described a thirteen-year-old Zeena in his introduction to her father's ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'' as "Zeena, remembered by people who saw the famous photo of the Satanic Church baptism as a tiny tot, but now a gorgeously developed teenager attracting a growing pack of wolves, human male variety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Satanic Bible (ref. introduction)|url=http://www.home.no/theriksen/The%20Satanic%20Bible.pdf|publisher=Avon Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''The Guardsman'', she describes becoming a mother at the age of fourteen while living in "a stifling, dysfunctional family life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zeena Schreck advocates free education|url=http://theguardsman.com/zeena-schreck-advocates-free-education/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vice mag 1 "&gt;{{cite web|title=Beelzebub's Daughter|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/beelzebubs-daughter-0000175-v19n4|work=Vice Magazine|publisher=Vice Media Inc|accessdate=26 July 2012|author=Annette Lamothe-Ramos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early artistic influences and training==

Zeena's work as a photographer, visual artist, musician/composer and writer are heavily influenced by mystical and magical traditions. Stylistically, she gravitated at an early age to artists and mentors whose art were also imbued by a mystical or magical vision.

As a teenager and young adult, she trained in and studied theater, drama and film. At sixteen years of age, Zeena passed the [[HSED|High School equivalency exam]], which enabled her to leave High School early, begin working legally and enroll in [[City College of San Francisco]], majoring in Drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Zeena Schreck for The Guardsman, SF City College Newspaper|url=http://theguardsman.com/zeena-schreck-advocates-free-education/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[City College of San Francisco|CCSF]]'s Drama Department, she also received instruction from [[Stella Adler Studio of Acting]], [[Eric Morris (actor)|Eric Morris]] acting coach, [[Viola Spolin]]'s student Marcia Kimmell of The Next Stage Improvisation Theater San Francisco, and the [[American Conservatory Theater|San Francisco School of Dramatic Arts]]. Her study focus was [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Hellenic sacred drama]], [[Improvisational theatre|improvisation]], and various branches of the [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] and [[method acting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zeena Schreck: Theatrical Appearances/Training|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=70&amp;Itemid=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of lineage as a vehicle for passing down metaphysical energy guides Zeena's ritual art. She traces the lineage of her magical art to the [[mentorship]] of her [[godparent|godfather]], filmmaker [[Kenneth Anger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art/Photography Overview about Zeena|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=88&amp;Itemid=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s and 1970s, Anger transmitted the influences of [[Curtis Harrington]], [[Jean Cocteau]], and [[Maya Deren]] on his own work to Zeena during her childhood and adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filmed interview with Zeena describing Kenneth Anger's influence on Zeena's early developmental years.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hurX8Tp3Mys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeena also became a long-time friend of [[Film director|director]] Curtis Harrington, who cast her as a [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]]-like character in his last film, ''Usher'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vice article: Remembering Curtis Harrington and His Films|url=https://www.vice.com/read/remembering-curtis-harrington-and-his-films}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Harrington: video documentary including clips from 'Usher'|url=https://vimeo.com/12090059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious groups==

In 1985, Zeena became the High Priestess of the Church of Satan, and remained its spokesperson until 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ref. Zeena became the High Priestess of the Church of Satan in 1985.[...]In 1990, Zeena left the Church of Satan and renounced her father's teachings of LaVeyan Satanism.|url=http://www.rebelcircus.com/blog/conspiracy-theorists-say-taylor-swift-clone-famous-satanist/|publisher=Rebel Circus}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would later become a devotee of the ancient Egyptian deity [[Set (deity)|Set]], becoming High Priestess of the Temple of Set in 2002, and forming the Sethian Liberation Movement later that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VICE Magazine interview ref.|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yv53ex/beelzebubs-daughter-0000175-v19n4|publisher=Vice Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviews, articles and reviews between 2011-2013 referenced her conversion to [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Tantric Buddhism]] in the [[Drikung Kagyu|Drikung]], [[Karma Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lineages, as well as her status as the spiritual leader of the Sethian Liberation Movement (SLM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article from Nov. 22, 2013 states, "Zeena is a practicing Tibetan Buddhist yogini (in the Drikung, Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lineages), so the disappointed Satanist's query might seem strange to those unaware of her history."|url=http://bushwickdaily.com/bushwick/categories/arts-and-culture/1807-the-left-hand-path-leads-to-performa-13|website=Bushwick Daily|publisher=Bushwick Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nightwatch Radio archive of Zeena Schreck interview: Episode 12-27-11|url=http://www.zombiebloodbath.com/nightwatch/nw-archives.html|website=Zombie Blood Bath/Nightwatch|ref=Episode 12-27-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church of Satan===

In the 1980s in the United States, there was a [[moral panic]] about [[Satanic ritual abuse]], sometimes referred to as the "Satanic Panic". It started with the publication of the now-discredited memoir ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' in 1980, and culminated in the [[McMartin preschool trial]], a heavily publicized trial which ran from 1984 to 1990, during which prosecutors, through aggressive and [[leading question]]s, managed to get over 300 of the preschool's children to testify that they had been sexually abused by their teachers as part of Satanic rituals. The charges were all eventually dropped. Media coverage during the trial tended to side with the prosecutors, and often singled out the Church of Satan as the culprit. This led Zeena to volunteer to serve as the Church of Satan's first spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=KJTV| title = KJTV Interviews Zeena LaVey | location = Los Angeles, California | airdate = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a September 2011 interview, Zeena recalled,

{{quote|In 1985, a US news show called ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' accused The Satanic Bible of being responsible for child daycare Satanic ritual abuse, allegations which were new then. ... I called my father and asked him what his media strategy would be to deal with this catastrophe. Nothing. He didn't care. As far as he was concerned it didn't concern him. It wasn't anything he needed to worry about. He certainly wasn't going out in public to do anything about it. He admitted that many media sources had already contacted him and he was just going to ignore it until it went away. I tried to convince him that this would only get worse if he didn't respond and that he really needed to get someone to answer calls quickly or it would be taken as an admission of guilt or suspicion. Finally he admitted he had no one to deal with interviews or media. I offered to help ''temporarily''  until he found someone. This was not what I'd intended to do with my life, I had other plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikolas &amp; Zeena Schreck original interview for Obsküre Magazine Sept 2011|url=http://www.obskuremag.net/articles/nikolas-zeena-schreck/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Zeena Schreck from Obsküre Magazine [in English] by Maxime Lachaud, September 2011|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99%3Ainterview-with-zeena-and-nikolas-schreck-from-obskuere-magazine-by-maxime-lachaud-september-2011&amp;catid=41&amp;Itemid=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the Church of Satan's spokesperson, Zeena appeared in nationally syndicated programs such as ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]'', ''[[Nightline]] with [[Ted Koppel]]'', ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show]]'' and ''[[Secrets &amp; Mysteries]]''.&lt;ref name="The First Family of Satanism"&gt;{{cite episode | title = "The First Family of Satanism"
 | location = Denver, Colorado| series= The First Family of Satanism | airdate = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also appeared on the ''[[Sally (1983 TV series)|Sally Jessy Raphael Show]]'', alongside her husband, debating several Christians who were invited onto the program to expound their own religious views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| series= Sally Jessy Raphael Show | title = Sally Jessy Raphael
 | location = New York City, New York | airdate = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, she appeared in such media presentations as Italy's [[RAI|RAI Mixer]] show and Toronto's Industrial Video presentation dedicated to a compilation of Zeena's TV appearances, ending with a lengthy radio interview for CUIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ref. television appearances Z.Schreck website|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=69&amp;Itemid=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also interviewed in a broadcast of "Devil Worship: Exposing Satan's Underground" released by Geraldo Rivera in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Devil Worship: Exposing Satan's Underground
 | location = Los Angeles, California | series = Geraldo| airdate = October 22, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Satanists|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=105%3Athe-new-satanists-by-gini-graham-scott-and-linda-blood-1994&amp;catid=41&amp;Itemid=57|work=The Official Zeena Schreck Website|publisher=Zeena|accessdate=26 July 2012|author=Gini Graham Scott, Linda Blood|pages=76–77|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeena sat alongside Michael A. Aquino (Temple of Set founder/High Priest), and repeatedly denied the rumors circulating at the time that the Church of Satan was in any way involved with ritual abuse. She also called the testimony of claimants involved into question, asking them rhetorically why, if people were being forced to give birth to babies for sacrificial rituals, no remains had ever been found.

In 1989, Anton LaVey's 1971 book ''The Compleat Witch, or What to Do When Virtue Fails'' was reprinted as ''[[The Satanic Witch]]'', with an introduction by Zeena. She toured the U.S. promoting her father's work in his absence, as he was no longer interested in making media appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KFI-AM 640 Radio Interview with Z. Schreck promoting The Satanic Witch|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nGW6VrrM4Q}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three volume set of Z.

In 1989, while promoting the book, Zeena appeared with her then husband [[Nikolas Schreck]] (not a member of the COS) in an interview with [[televangelist]] [[Bob Larson]], during which they both refuted any Satanic criminal ties, and pressed Larson on his own ideals, stating that it was hypocritical of him to endorse such claims by Christians, pointing out the Christian background of many criminals, and violent acts within Christian history, such as the crusades.&lt;ref name="The First Family of Satanism"/&gt;

Zeena's Interview on KJTV with Tony Valdez, 1990, was the last interview she granted as public representative and High Priestess of the Church of Satan before resigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Awesome program listing for Zeena Schreck/Tony Valdez Interview - Category "Talk Show: The First Family of Satanism"|url=http://networkawesome.com/2013-3-18/talk-show-the-first-family-of-satanism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tony valdez youtube"&gt;{{cite web|title=1990 Zeena Schreck Interview on KJTV with Tony Valdez|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNwdcKdboQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2013 interview televised by Network Awesome, Zeena spoke for the first time on camera about her experiences with media during the "Satanic Panic" years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hurX8Tp3Mys|title=Zeena Schreck - March 18, 2013 televised interview by Network Awesome|first=|last=ZeenaSchreckOfficial|date=18 March 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeena was also in regular contact with law enforcement agencies and personnel, including Detective Patrick Metoyer of the LAPD&lt;ref name="tony valdez youtube" /&gt; and Robert D. Hicks, law-enforcement specialist with the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services and author of several precedent-setting treatises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cult Crime Network listing for Robert D. Hicks citing writings from the time Hicks was in dialog with Zeena.|url=http://www.holysmoke.org/report/62.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  including ''In Pursuit of Satan: The Police and The Occult''. ''In Pursuit of Satan'' began the wave of authoritative reports debunking the Satanic Panic. Much of what Hicks gleaned from Zeena's dialogs with him was included in this treatise. Prior to Zeena's dialogs and meetings with government agencies, police and law enforcement had only a very limited knowledge of Satanism. In 1992, the FBI issued an official report refuting the criminal conspiracy theories of this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1992 FBI Report on Satanic Ritual Abuse, Kenneth V. Lanning|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/satanism/satanism1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaving the Church of Satan, 1990===

In 1990, she resigned from the Church of Satan and renounced [[LaVeyan Satanism]]. According to Zeena's official web site, "In the process of defending the Church of Satan from these unfounded claims in the U.S. mass media, Zeena's media appearances attracted a new upsurge of membership to the formerly moribund organization even as she began to question and ultimately reject the self-centered philosophy she promoted. As she toured the United States on behalf of the Church of Satan, Zeena's crisis of faith reached its highpoint when she learned that most of her father's self-created legend was based on lies and that many of his works were plagiarized. When jealousy and spite motivated Anton LaVey and his administrator [[Blanche Barton|Densley-Barton]] to actually endanger Zeena's life, she could no longer continue to cover up her progenitor's true character in good conscience. This behind the scenes tension should be kept in mind when viewing or hearing Zeena's interviews from that time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1990 Zeena Schreck Interview collection|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=75%3Aqzeena-lavey-radio-interviews-three-volume-setq&amp;catid=36&amp;Itemid=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zeena's homepage, remaining members of the Church of Satan and the LaVey family "reacted to her resignation by indulging in a typical cult-like character assassination campaign against her."&lt;ref name="zeena webpage"/&gt; Particularly active in the hostility against Zeena were [[Blanche Barton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blanche Barton letter on Zeena Schreck to the Village Voice|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-08-27/specials/letters/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter H. Gilmore]], [[Peggy Nadramia]], [[Boyd Rice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boyd Rice's official website|url=http://www.boydrice.com/interviews/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lisa Crystal Carver]], Daniel Ignace Kapelovitz,&lt;ref name="bizarre interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bizarre Magazine, May 2005 interview with Zeena's son and daughter-in-law Stanton and Szandora LaVey by Boyd Rice music producer Daniel Kapelovitz|url=http://www.bizarremag.com/film-and-music/interviews/1809/stanton_lavey.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Wessel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Example in content of Larry Wessel's documentary of Boyd Rice, Iconoclast, 2010 WesselMania|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1827439/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton and Szandora LaVey.

After her renunciation of the Church of Satan, Zeena Schreck severed use of her born name "LaVey" and legally changed her last name, for all official matters, to "Schreck". In a December 30, 1990 open letter to Michael A. Aquino of the [[Temple of Set]], she stated: "In light of all of the factors herein, I also officially severed my given surname [LaVey] and now prefer to be known only as Zeena. As I feel naturally aristocratic, I also have no need for the empty titles of Magistra or High Priestess that have been bandied about and fought over."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter from Zeena LaVey to Michael Aquino|url=http://www.skeptictank.org/files/mys5/zeena.htm|work=Skeptic Tank Files|publisher=The Skeptic Tank|accessdate=26 July 2012|author=Zeena LaVey|date=30 December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, she does not accept correspondence addressed to "Zeena LaVey," "Zeena LaVey-Schreck", or any variant using the name LaVey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact:The Official Zeena Schreck Website|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=84&amp;Itemid=59|work=The Official Zeena Schreck Website|publisher=Zeena|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temple of Set===
Zeena began to pursue ancient religious practices relating to the Egyptian god Seth and Sethianism. She has stated, "While I was residing in Vienna, I visited a museum where a Sethian altar lives. It was there that I had a very profound experience that enabled me to clearly see the course for my future."[40] At the time, she was also practicing traditional tantra and yoga. Her experiences within those two systems, as well as her central role and life's experience in other occult and esoteric milieux, would contribute considerably to the content of her book ''Demons of the Flesh'', co-authored with Nikolas Schreck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Demons of the Flesh JAN 21, 2003 AT 6:01 AM (UPDATED FEB 16, 2015)|url=http://www.nypress.com/-demons-of-the-flesh/|website=nypress.com|publisher=New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=[ ... ]residing in Vienna, I visited a museum where a Sethian altar lives|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yv53ex/beelzebubs-daughter-0000175-v19n4|website=www.vice.com|publisher=Vice Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Zeena and co-guest Nikolas Schreck once again debated Christian Minister Bob Larson. This time she did not represent Satanism but rather Sethianism, though the interview was titled "Showdown With Satanism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Showdown with Satanism|url=https://www.amazon.com/Showdown-Satanism-Bob-Larson/dp/B001O0VW98|website=amazon.com|publisher=Bob Larson Ministries}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time she was III° Priestess of Set.

In 2002 Zeena became High Priestess of the Temple of Set.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Sethian Liberation Movement===
The Sethian Liberation Movement was founded on November 8, 2002, after Zeena Schreck resigned from the Temple of Set with four Masters of the Temple of Set (one Master, Magister Michael Kelly, was also a member of the corporate Board of Directors for the California non-profit organization The Temple of Set).&lt;ref name="dis info mag" /&gt; Details of the departure were explained in a letter dated November 8, 2002 from the newly departed Temple of Set Council of Nine member to an Adept IIº member regarding the events leading to Zeena's resignation and the founding of the Storm, later renamed the Sethian Liberation Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter regarding Zeena's resignation from the Temple of Set Council of Nine|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=102%3Aletter-from-a-temple-of-set-council-of-nine-member-regarding-the-events-leading-to-zeenas-resignation-and-the-founding-of-the-storm-later-the-sethian-liberation-movement-november-8-2002&amp;catid=41&amp;Itemid=57|work=The Official Zeena Schreck Website|publisher=Zeena|accessdate=26 July 2012|author=Michael|date=8 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Zeena Schreck resigned from the Temple of Set, a [[Disinformation (company)|Disinfo]] listing for the Temple of Set from December 17, 2002 under the heading: 2002 Schism: The Storm Awakens reported, "High Priest Don Webb stepped down, and, on 9 September 2002, was succeeded by High Priestess Zeena Schreck. Six weeks after the Helsinki Conclave (September 2002), Zeena, Magister Aaron Besson, Magister Nikolas Schreck and Magister Michael Kelly all resigned on 8 November 2002. Four Priests Alfred Rodriguez, Kevin Rockhill, Jared Davison and Richard Gavin also resigned. Temple of Set sources have claimed that eighteen Initiates have resigned while others have estimated the number at closer to sixty (including several Orders, Elements, and members of the Adept and Setian degrees)."&lt;ref name="dis info mag"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Temple of Set|url=http://old.disinfo.com/archive/pages/dossier/id163/pg1/index.html|work=Disinformation|publisher=The Disinformation Company Ltd.|accessdate=26 July 2012|author=Alex Burns|date=17 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the Sethian Liberation Movement's earliest public Frequently Answered Questions documents released, Disinfo referenced it in their post covering the Temple of Seth/Storm schism: " ... &amp;nbsp;[the] document defines the new and as-yet unnamed group as&amp;nbsp; ... a loose confederation of Setian Teachers and Students, an alliance of Orders." The group has eschewed the Temple's administrative and non-profit structure, as well as its degree system and titles. "We work together through mutual respect and interest, not through any organizational limitations or restrictions", the FAQ document states. Finally, its founders have sought to avoid the "magical society" structure of post-Theosophy groups: the confederation is "an ongoing Magical Working in which we may participate, a living, dynamic and evolving thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter "A Love Cult" p249-251|url=http://www.parareligion.ch/schreck.htm|work=Demons of the Flesh The Complete Guide to Left Hand Sex Magic|publisher=Nikolas and Zeena Schreck|accessdate=26 July 2012|author=Nikolas and Zeena Schreck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeena's homepage states, "Drawing on her own triumph over these and other dysfunctional family experiences, Zeena, a professional bereavement counsellor, founded The Sethian Liberation Movement's public outreach program PHOENIX to help others in similar situations."&lt;ref name="zeena webpage"/&gt; It explains that "Since 2004 Phoenix provides spiritual healing for victims of exploitative pseudo-religious organizations, former gang members, whistle-blowing ex-employees of corrupt corporations and governmental agencies, relatives of the violently mentally ill, and survivors of all forms of institutional abuse, including secretly abused children and spouses of prominent personalities."

In 2004 Zeena and Nikolas Schreck spoke about their book ''Demons of the Flesh'' on ''The Devil's Advocate'' radio show. In that interview, Zeena also spoke about the Storm (before it had been renamed Sethian Liberation Movement) and its incorporation of the tantric left way practices she writes of in her book.&lt;ref name="Devil's Advocate Radio Show"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Interview with Nikolas and Zeena Schreck|series=Devil's Advocate Radio Show|airdate=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNpT032OvNc|title=Nikolas and Zeena Schreck interview with Devil's Advocate Radio Show part 1 of 4|first=|last=Styxhexenhammer666|date=7 December 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011 Zeena Schreck spoke about the Sethian Liberation Movement on ''Nightwatch Radio'' while also promoting two of her short fiction stories, ''A Short History of Buddhism in Berlin'' and ''Lost and Found: A Fairy Tale of Sethian Awakening'', in the literary journal ''Beatdom'' released December 2011. According to the ''Nightwatch'' interview Zeena Schreck states that the Sethian Liberation Movement (SLM) is not membership based nor a 'group' seeking to fill dues quotas, or something to join but rather a practice.

In December 2012, Zeena Schreck was invited back to Nightwatch Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zeena Schreck Nightwatch Interview Dec. 11, 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYBv2_ujDL4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time, promoting the 2012 Radio Werewolf release of ''The Vinyl Solution - Analog Artifacts: Ritual Instrumentals and Undercover Versions'' CD, the first authorized Radio Werewolf release in 20 years,&lt;ref name="zeena.eu radio werewolf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Werewolf's The Vinyl Solution - Analog Artifacts: Ritual Instrumentals and Undercover Versions - CD|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=92&amp;Itemid=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''Beatdom'''s Crime issue #12 featuring a vintage portrait of Zeena on the cover and her theatre monologue, "Night Shift, Richmond Station".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beatdom website ref. to issue #12 "What to expect from Beatdom"|url=http://www.beatdom.com/?p=2172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 2012, Zeena curated a stream of videos for [[Network Awesome|Network Awesome's]] Live Music Show, with audio and visual clips arranged in an autobiographical manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Awesome Live Music Show/Zeena Schreck Dec. 10, 2012|url=http://networkawesome.com/2012-12-10/live-music-show-zeena-schreck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18, 2013 Network Awesome's daily program opened with an exclusive original production featuring Zeena Schreck's first one-on-one televised interview in 22 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Network Awesome Original Production:Talk Show Interview with Zeena Schreck by Artist Jen Ray |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hurX8Tp3Mys}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by artist Jen Ray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jen Ray Artist website |url=http://jenrayart.com/Interview-with-Zeena-Schreck}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network Awesome spotlighted Zeena with a full day of programming, referencing various facets of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=March 18th, 2013 Network Awesome's daily program spotlighting Zeena Schreck|url=http://networkawesome.com/2013-3-18/talk-show-zeena-schreck}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other features in the day's program included archival interviews of Zeena and documentaries relating to her current spiritual pursuits and practices.

In 2016, a mock [[conspiracy theory]] in a vein similar to that of the [[Ted Cruz–Zodiac meme]] arose online, conflating Zeena with popular musical artist [[Taylor Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/09/10/taylor-swift-satanist-clone-zeena-lavey/#VC7ULgqdnmqw|title=Here's why the theory that Taylor Swift is a satanist clone absolutely checks out|first=Tricia|last=Gilbride|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 8/8/88 Rally===
On August 8, 1988, a large gathering converged on the [[Strand Theater (San Francisco)|Strand Theater]] in San Francisco for the film debut of a 'mockumentary' about [[Charles Manson]]. The event, planned and carried out by [[Nikolas Schreck]], was the largest single gathering of this kind in history{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}. Zeena spoke at the beginning of the rally and a film of her baptism was played. In a 2011 interview with Zeena for French music magazine ''Obsküre'', she stated that 8-8-88 "would be the only performance that Nikolas, Evil Wilhelm [the original Radio Werewolf percussionist], and I ever performed live together. That marked the transition point spanning three phases of Radio Werewolf: 1) the Nikolas Schreck/Evil Wilhelm collaboration, 2) the solo Nikolas Schreck phase, and 3) the Nikolas Schreck/Zeena collaboration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Nikolas and Zeena Schreck from Obsküre Magazine by Maxime Lachaud, September 2011|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99%3Ainterview-with-zeena-and-nikolas-schreck-from-obskuere-magazine-by-maxime-lachaud-september-2011&amp;catid=41&amp;Itemid=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original French version of cited Interview with Zeena and Nikolas Schreck in Obsküre Magazine.|url=http://www.obskuremag.net/articles/nikolas-zeena-schreck/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also featured were [[Boyd Rice|NON]], [[Adam Parfrey|Amok Press]] and [[Kris Force]], a musician who at the time owned the Strand Theater.

From 1988–1993, Zeena was co-director of the experimental musical project [[Radio Werewolf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist Description: Between 1988-1993 Zeena was composer, vocalist, musician and graphic designer for the sonic magical musical project Radio Werewolf.|url=http://13.performa-arts.org/artists/zeena-schreck}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as composer, vocalist, musician and graphic designer on the Radio Werewolf recordings "Songs for the End of the World", "The Lightning and the Sun", "Bring Me The Head of Geraldo Rivera", "These Boots Were Made for Walking", and  "Love Conquers All." Her performances were exclusively European-based at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zeena|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Zeena|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Recordings Credits for Zeena Schreck listed on her website|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=89&amp;Itemid=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Published Illustrations|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=86&amp;Itemid=88|work=The Official Zeena Schreck Website|publisher=Zeena|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Radio Werewolf released ''The Vinyl Solution - Analog Artifacts: Ritual Instrumentals and Undercover Versions'' Compact Disc, the first authorized Radio Werewolf release in 20 years.&lt;ref name="zeena.eu radio werewolf"/&gt;

In 2016, [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] magazine ranked Radio Werewolf #4 on their 'The 25 weirdest bands of all time' list, stating: "Formed during the height of 'Satanic Panic' hysteria in mid-80's America, Radio Werewolf was once considered 'the most dangerous band in the world', largely due to the notoriety of their vocalist, Zeena Schreck[ ... ]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classic Rock: The 24 weirdest bands of all time|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-06-28/the-25-weirdest-bands-of-all-time}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, The Top Tens Most Satanic Bands listed Radio Werewolf, "Yes!, Since when does Heavy Metal have to be the only satanic music.

===Performa 13, New York===

On November 8, 2013, the visual art performance biennial ''[[Performa (performance festival)|Performa]]'' presented Zeena accompanied by New York musician [[Hisham Bharoocha]] (first percussion) and Danish musician Anders Hermund (second percussion), for a vocal based work that tapped into the ritual use of sacred syllables from [[Vajrayana]], [[Shaktism]] and Sethian-Typhonian left-way [[tantra|tantric]] practices, "originating from emptiness, gradually transforming into a sound and voice collage on a stage set design by Frank Haines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank Haines &amp; Zeena Schreck, Live From the Eye of the Storm - Event description|url=http://13.performa-arts.org/event/frank-haines-zeena-schreck}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Zeena's first solo performance in her native country since her [[Expatriate|expatriation]] to Europe in 1990.

David Sanderson described the event, "Jingling bells and padded footsteps echoed in the darkness. The curtains silently parted, dramatically revealing an electrified, vermilion environment. Dead center, with hands held in the Mudra position, stood the seemingly twenty-foot tall goddess Zeena. With a painted gong behind her, Bharoocha and Hermund adorned her sides. Bharoocha lit incense that swept through the audience as Zeena's commanding gaze pierced us all (everyone I talked to after the show swore she was staring directly at them)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Left Hand Path Leads to Performa 13 by David Sanderson|url=http://bushwickdaily.com/2013/11/the-left-hand-path-leads-to-performa-13/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wave-Gotik-Treffen music festival===

On May 23, 2015, after a 24-year retreat from musical performances, Zeena made her official return to music in Europe, now as a solo artist, at the [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] festival in Leipzig, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heathen Harvest report: Zeena Schreck Performs a Typhonian Tantric Ritual Soundscape at the Egyptian Museum, Leipzig|url=https://heathenharvest.org/2015/04/18/zeena-schreck-performs-a-typhonian-tantric-ritual-soundscape-at-the-egyptian-museum-leipzig/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concert, held amid "the sacred, magically charged ancient artifacts housed in Leipzig's Egyptian Museum (at the [[Leipzig University]])," was a unique ritual soundscape which Zeena composed especially for the theme of that environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KPopStarz report: Legendary Magic Practitioner Zeena Schreck Returns To European Music Scene For First Time In 24 Years This Saturday, May 23|url=http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/203000/20150519/zeena-schreck-new-music.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was accompanied by Cory Vielma and [[John Murphy (musician)|John Murphy]].
