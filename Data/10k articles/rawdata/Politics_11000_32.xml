The '''2015 Geldermalsen riot''' was a riot in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] town of [[Geldermalsen]] on 16 December 2015 in protest of plans announced by the town council to construct a centre for 1,500 asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Migrant crisis: Dutch town riots over asylum centre plan|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35118496|publisher=BBC News|date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Thousands riot in small Dutch town over plan for asylum-seeker centre |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/thousands-riot-in-small-dutch-town-over-plan-for-asylum-seeker-centre|work=The Guardian|date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Riots==
On 16 December 2015, around 2,000 people in Geldermalsen protested and rioted outside the town hall as the town announced plans to build an asylum centre and accept 1,500 asylum seekers in light of the [[European migrant crisis]].&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch protesters riot over plans to build refugee center in small town of Geldermalsen (VIDEO)|url=https://www.rt.com/news/326207-dutch-riot-geldermalsen-refugees/|website=rt.com|publisher=[[Russia Today]]|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protesters attempted to storm the town hall while throwing beer bottles, fireworks and stones were thrown at it and police, as politicians discussed the plans. Several protesters, two police officers and a businesswoman inside the city hall suffered injuries during the riot.&lt;ref name=rt /&gt;&lt;ref name=dutchnews1&gt;{{cite web|title=Woman hospitalised after she was hit by police in Geldermalsen|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2015/12/woman-hospitalised-after-she-was-hit-by-police-in-geldermalsen/|website=dutchnews.nl|publisher=Dutch News|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen protesters were reported to have been arrested in the riots.&lt;ref name=rt /&gt;

==Aftermath==
Dutch politicians have characterised the riot as "unacceptable" and "un-Dutch".&lt;ref name=rt /&gt;

It was later announced that the plans of constructing an asylum centre in the town had been scrapped, with the town council taking self-criticism for the speed of the decision process and the scale of the plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Geldermalsen refugee centre plan dropped in wake of riots|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2015/12/geldermalsen-refugee-centre-plan-dropped-in-wake-of-riots/|work=dutchnews.nl|date=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests and riots have erupted in several Dutch towns and villages since 2015 in protest of plans to take in record numbers of migrants.&lt;ref name="YahooNews"&gt;{{Cite news|title=New riot in Dutch town against refugee centre|url=https://news.yahoo.com/riot-dutch-town-against-refugee-centre-212827300.html|publisher=Yahoo News/AFP|date=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, in [[Heesch, Netherlands|Heesch]], 1000 protesters rioted after plans to take in 500 asylum seekers in the town.&lt;ref name="YahooNews"/&gt;

'''Adultism''' is ''"the power adults have over children"''.&lt;ref name="Flasher1978"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flasher | first1 = J. | year = 1978 | title = Adultism | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 13 | issue = 51| pages = 517–523 | pmid = 735921 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More narrowly, adultism is defined as ''"prejudice and accompanying systematic discrimination against young people"''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregoire/C. M. Jungers, ''The Counsellor's Companion'' (2007) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; On a more philosophical basis, the term has also been defined as ''"bias towards adults... and the social addiction to adults, including their ideas, activities, and attitudes"''.&lt;ref name="Fletcher2013"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Fletcher | first1 = A. | year = 2013 | title = Ending Discrimination Against Young People | publisher = CommonAction Publishing | location = Olympia, WA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

=== Coinage ===

The word adultism was used by Patterson Du Bois in 1903,&lt;ref&gt;Patterson Du Bois, ''Fireside Child-Study'' (1903) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and appears in French [[psychology]] literature in 1929, describing the influence of adults over children. It was seen as a condition wherein a child possessed adult-like "physique and [[spirit]]", and was exemplified by,
:A boy of 12 and a girl of 13 who had the spirit and personality of adults.... They were placed in institutions because of stealing and prostitution. These forms of precocity lead the individual into difficulties and should be recognized early in the development of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Courbon | first1 = P. | year = 1933 | title = Mental adultism and precocious growth of the personality | url = | journal = Annales médico-psychologiques  | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 355–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition was superseded by a late 1970s journal article proposing that adultism is the abuse of the power that adults have over children. The author identified examples of adultism not only in parents but in teachers, psychotherapists, the clergy, police, judges, and juries.&lt;ref name="Flasher1978" /&gt;

=== Usage ===

Adultism is defined as the "behaviors and attitudes based on the assumptions that adults are better than young people, and entitled to act upon young people without agreement".&lt;ref name="Bell1995"&gt;Bell, J. (1995) [http://www.youthbuild.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=htIRI3PIKoG&amp;b=4808015&amp;ct=6640437 "Understanding Adultism: A Major Obstacle to Developing Positive Youth-Adult Relationships"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. [[YouthBuild USA]]. Retrieved 9/2/11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gong|first1=Jennifer|last2=Wright|first2=Dana|title=The Context of Power: Young People as Evaluators|journal=American Journal of Evaluation|date=September 2007|volume=28|issue=3|pages=327–333|doi=10.1177/1098214007306680}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also seen as, "an addiction to the attitudes, ideas, beliefs, and actions of adults."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freechild.org/adultism.htm Introduction to Adultism]. [[Freechild Project]]. Retrieved 4/4/10.&lt;/ref&gt; Adultism is popularly used to describe any [[discrimination]] against young people and is distinguished from [[ageism]], which is simply prejudice on the grounds of age; not specifically against youth. Adultism is ostensibly caused by fear of [[fear of children|children]] and [[fear of youth|youth]].&lt;ref&gt;Scraton, P. (1997) ''"Childhood" in "crisis"?'' Routledge. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that 'adultism, which is associated with a view of the self that trades on rejecting and excluding child-subjectivity, has always been present in Western culture'.&lt;ref&gt;David Kennedy, ''The Well of Being''(2006) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Fletcher&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Fletcher2013&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that adultism has three main expressions throughout society:
* '''Attitudinal Adultism''': Personal feelings, assumptions, and beliefs that form a person’s attitudes about young people. This is also called ''internalized adultism''.
* '''Cultural Adultism''': The shared attitudes, including beliefs and customs, promoting the assumption that adults are superior to anyone who is not identified as an adult, simply because of their age. This is also called ''social adultism''.
* '''Structural Adultism''': The normalization and legitimization of historical, cultural, institutional and interpersonal dynamics that routinely advantage adults while producing cumulative and chronic adverse outcomes for young people. This is also referred to as ''institutional adultism''.

A study by the Crisis Prevention Institute of the prevalence of adultism found an increasing number of local youth-serving organizations addressing the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Tate, Thomas F. and Copas, Randall L. (Spring 2003) "Insist or Enlist?: Adultism versus Climates of Excellence," ''Reclaiming Children and Youth: The Journal of Strength-based Interventions, v12'' n1. p 40-45.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a local program in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]], describes the impact of adultism, which "hinders the development of youth, in particular, their self-esteem and self-worth, ability to form positive relationships with caring adults, or even see adults as allies", on their website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthtogether.net/mcm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=39 Youth Together Glossary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623094428/http://www.youthtogether.net/mcm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=39 |date=June 23, 2007 }}. Youth Together. Retrieved 4/1/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Similar terms ===

Adultism is used to describe the oppression of children and young people by adults, which is seen as having the same power dimension in the lives of young people as racism and sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roche|first1=Jeremy|title=Children: Rights, Participation and Citizenship|journal=Childhood|date=November 1999|volume=6|issue=4|pages=475–493|doi=10.1177/0907568299006004006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is treated as a generalization of [[paternalism]], allowing for the broad force of adulthood beyond males, and may be witnessed in the infantalization of children and youth. [[Pedophobia]] (the fear of children) and [[ephebiphobia]] (the fear of youth) have been proposed as the antecedents to adultism.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2006) ''Washington Youth Voice Handbook'' Olympia, WA: CommonAction.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tokophobia]], the fear of childbirth, may also be a precursor; [[gerontophobia]], or its antonym, [[gerontocracy]], may be extensions of adultism.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Similar terms such as adult privilege, adultarchy, and [[adultcentrism]] have been proposed as alternatives which are more [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthrights.org/threetypes.php |title=Three Types of Youth Liberation: Youth Equality, Youth Power, Youth Culture |first=Sven |last=Bonnichsen |publisher=National Youth Rights Association |accessdate=January 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201231951/http://www.youthrights.org/threetypes.php |archivedate=February 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activists alternatively call adultism "youthism," or "childism" equating it to [[sexism]] and [[heterosexism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/dominickint.htm Youth Liberation: An Interview With Brian Dominick on Znet]  {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070807052120/http://www.zmag.org/dominickint.htm |date=August 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of adultism is [[jeunism]], which is defined as the preference of young people and adolescents over adults.

At least one prominent organization describes discrimination against youth as [[ageism]], which is any form of discrimination against anyone due to their age.  The [[National Youth Rights Association]] argues that ageism is a more natural and understandable term than adultism and thus is more commonly used among the young people affected by this discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthrights.org/forums/showthread.php?t=2188 Thread from National Youth Rights Association Online Forums re: Ageism vs. Adultism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824103141/http://www.youthrights.org/forums/showthread.php?t=2188 |date=August 24, 2006 }}. Retrieved 7/20/08.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocates of using 'ageism' also believe it makes common cause with older people fighting against their own form of age discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oneandfour.org/archives/2005/10/ageism_vs_adult.html [[Alex Koroknay-Palicz]]'s blog] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523205237/http://oneandfour.org/archives/2005/10/ageism_vs_adult.html |date=May 23, 2006 }}. Retrieved 7/20/08.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a national organization called [[Youth On Board]] counters this, arguing that "addressing adultist behavior by calling it ageism is discrimination against youth in itself."&lt;ref&gt;Young, K &amp; Sazama, J (2006) ''15 Points to Successfully Involving Youth in Decision-Making.'' Boston: [http://www.youthonboard.org Youth On Board].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
In his seminal 1978 article, Flasher explained that adultism is born of the belief that children are inferior, professing that adultism can be manifested as excessive nurturing, possessiveness, or over-restrictiveness, all of which are consciously or unconsciously geared toward excessive control of a child.&lt;ref&gt;Flasher, J. (1978) "Adultism." ''Adolescence'' 13(51) Fal 1978, 521.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been associated with [[psychological projection]] and [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]], a process whereby 'the one with the power attributes his or her unconscious, unresolved sexual and aggressive material' to the child – 'both the dark and the light side...hence the [[Child (archetype)|divine child]]/deficit child'&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; split.

Recently, theologians Heather Eaton and Matthew Fox proposed, "Adultism derives from adults repressing the inner child."&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, H &amp; Fox, M. "Chapter 10: Transcendent Spirit: Child Honoring and Religion." in Cavoukian, R. (Ed) &amp; Olfman, S. (Ed). (2006). ''Child Honoring: How to Turn This World Around''. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers/Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Caldwell Holt|John Holt]] stated, "An understanding of adultism might begin to explain what I mean when I say that much of what is known as [[children's art]] is an adult invention."&lt;ref&gt;Holt, J. (Ed) ''Teach Your Own: The John Holt Book of Homeschooling''. Perseus Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; That perspective is seemingly supported by [[Maya Angelou]], who remarked:
{{cquote|We are all creative, but by the time we are three or four years old, someone has knocked the creativity out of us. Some people shut up the kids who start to tell stories.

==Evidence of adultism==

A 2006/2007 survey conducted by the [[Children's Rights Alliance for England]] and the [[National Children's Bureau]] asked 4,060 children and young people whether they have ever been treated unfairly based on various criteria (race, age, sex, sexual orientation, etc.).  A total of 43% of British youth surveyed reported experiencing discrimination based on their age, substantially more than other categories of discrimination like sex (27%), race (11%), or sexual orientation (6%).&lt;ref&gt;Willow, C., Franklin, A. and Shaw, C. (2007).  Meeting the obligations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in England. Children and young people's messages to Government. DCSF.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==

In addition to Fletcher,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; other experts have identified multiple forms of adultism, offering a typology that includes internalized adultism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthonboard.org/atf/cf/%7BDB81B10C-CCBB-46FE-BEF4-011DCFE93F33%7D/GetTheWordOut.pdf Get The Word Out!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926003153/http://www.youthonboard.org/atf/cf/%7BDB81B10C-CCBB-46FE-BEF4-011DCFE93F33%7D/GetTheWordOut.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }} Jenny Sazama (2004). p.12&lt;/ref&gt; institutionalized adultism,&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, D. &amp; Rehman, B. (eds). (2002)''Colonize This!: Young Women of Color on Today's Feminism''. Seal Press&lt;/ref&gt; cultural adultism, and other forms.

=== Internalized adultism ===

In a publication published by the [[W. K. Kellogg Foundation]], [[University of Michigan]] professor [[Barry Checkoway]] asserts that internalized adultism causes youth to "question their own legitimacy, doubt their ability to make a difference" and perpetuate a "culture of silence" among young people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wkkf.org/pubs/YouthED/Pub564.pdf Adults as Allies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926003154/http://www.wkkf.org/pubs/YouthED/Pub564.pdf |date=September 26, 2007 }} (1998) WK Kellogg Foundation. Retrieved 4/1/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Adultism convinces us as children that children don't really count," reports an investigative study, and it "becomes extremely important to us [children] to have the approval of adults and be 'in good' with them, even if it means betraying our fellow children. This aspect of internalized adultism leads to such phenomena as tattling on our siblings or being the 'teacher's pet,' to name just two examples."

Other examples of internalized adultism include many forms of violence imposed upon children and youth by adults who are reliving the violence they faced as young people, such as [[corporal punishment]], [[sexual abuse]], [[verbal abuse]], and community incidents that include store policies prohibiting youth from visiting shops without adults, and police, teachers, or parents chasing young people from areas without just cause.&lt;ref name="Bell1995" /&gt;

=== Institutional adultism ===
Institutional adultism may be apparent in any instance of [[systemic bias]], where formalized limitations or demands are placed on people simply because of their young age. Policies, laws, rules, organizational structures, and systematic procedures each serve as mechanisms to leverage, perpetuate, and instill adultism throughout society. These limitations are often reinforced through physical force, coercion or police actions and are often seen as double-standards.&lt;ref&gt;Males, M. (1997) ''Framing Youth: 10 Myths about the Next Generation.'' "Courts have explicitly ruled that policy-makers may impose adult responsibilities and punishments on individual youths as if they were adults at the same time laws and policies abrogate adolescents’ rights en masse as if they were children."&lt;/ref&gt;  This treatment is increasingly seen as a form of [[gerontocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0124/p25s04-usmb.html Monitor Breakfast with James Carville and Stanley Greenberg]  "This is not class warfare, this is generational warfare. This administration and old wealthy people have declared war on young people. That is the real war that is going on here. And that is the war we've got to talk about." - James Carville&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gatto, J.T. (2002) [http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/toc1.htm The Underground History of American Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210112502/http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/toc1.htm |date=December 10, 2006 }} "Children allowed to take responsibility and given a serious part in the larger world are always superior to those merely permitted to play and be passive. At the age of twelve, [[Admiral Farragut]] got his first command."&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions perpetuating adultism may include the fiduciary, legal, educational, communal, religious, and governmental sectors of a community. [[Social science]] literature has identified adultism as "within the context of the social inequality and the oppression of children, where children are denied human rights and are disproportionately victims of maltreatment and exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lombardo|first1=Lucien|last2=Polonko|first2=Karen A.|title=Interdisciplinary Contributions to the Prevention of Child Maltreatment|journal=International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences|volume=4|issue=12|pages=89–112|url=http://iji.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.88/prod.945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Fighting for Hope" (1984) for specific evidence of institutional adultism in healthcare, identified as structural violence. "A third of the 2,000 million people in the developing countries are starving or suffering from malnutrition. Twenty-five per cent of their children die before their fifth birthday... Less than 10 per cent of the 15 million children who died this year had been vaccinated against the six most common and dangerous children's diseases. Vaccinating every child costs £3 per child. But not doing so costs us five million lives a year. These are classic examples of '''structural violence'''."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural adultism ===
'''Cultural adultism''' is a much more ambiguous, yet much more prevalent, form of [[discrimination]] or intolerance towards youth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Any restriction or exploitation of people because of their young age, as opposed to their ability, comprehension, or capacity, may be said to be adultist. These restrictions are often attributed to euphemisms afforded to adults on the basis of age alone, such as "better judgment" or "the wisdom of age".  A parenting magazine editor comments, "Most of the time people talk differently to kids than to adults, and often they act differently, too."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ru.org/83wright.html Treating children as equals.] Wright, J. New Renaissance Magazine (2001)."&lt;/ref&gt; This summarizes cultural adultism. For examples see:

=== Social stratification ===
Discrimination against age is increasingly recognized as a form of [[bigotry]] in social and cultural settings around the world. An increasing number of social institutions are acknowledging the positions of children and teenagers as an [[oppression|oppressed]] [[Minority group#Age minorities|minority group]].&lt;ref&gt;(2006) ''15 Points to Successfully Involving Youth in Decision-Making.'' Boston: Youth On Board. p 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Many youth are rallying against the adultist myths spread through mass media from the 1970s through the 1990s.
&lt;ref&gt;(2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20060718010357/http://www.movementstrategy.org/pdfs/MSMC.pdf "Making Space - Making Change: Profiles of Youth-Led and Youth-Driven Organizations"]. Movement Strategy Center. p 17. Retrieved 9/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, H. "The Abandoned Generation: Democracy Beyond the Culture of Fear" (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research compiled from two sources (a Cornell University nationwide study, and a Harvard University study on youth) has shown that social stratification between age groups causes [[stereotype|stereotyping]] and generalization; for instance, the media-perpetuated myth that all adolescents are immature, violent and rebellious.&lt;ref&gt;(2006) ''15 Points to Successfully Involving Youth in Decision-Making.'' Boston: Youth On Board. p 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of adultism contend that this has led to growing number of youth, academics, researchers, and other adults rallying against adultism and ageism, such as organizing education programs, protesting statements, and creating organizations devoted to publicizing the concept and addressing it.&lt;ref name="Decision-Making. p 92"&gt;(2006) ''15 Points to Successfully Involving Youth in Decision-Making.'' Boston: Youth On Board. p 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously, research shows that young people who struggle against adultism within community organizations have a high rate of impact upon said agencies, as well as their peers, the adults who work with them, and the larger community to which the organization belongs&lt;ref&gt;Zeldin, S, Kusgen-McDaniel, A, &amp; Topitzes, D. [http://www.theinnovationcenter.org/pdfs/Youth_in_Decision_Making_Report.pdf "Youth In Decision-Making: A Study on The Impacts of Youth on Adults and Organizations"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819131311/http://www.theinnovationcenter.org/pdfs/Youth_in_Decision_Making_Report.pdf |date=August 19, 2006 }} (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural responses ===
There may be many negative effects of adultism, including [[ephebiphobia]] and a growing [[generation gap]]. A reactive social response to adultism takes the form of the [[children's rights movement]], led by young people who strike against being exploited for their labor. Numerous popular outlets are employed to strike out against adultism, particularly [[list of songs about school|music]] and movies. Additionally, many youth-led social change efforts have inherently responded to adultism, particularly those associated with [[youth activism]] and [[student activism]], each of which in their own respects have struggled with the effects of institutionalized and cultural adultism.&lt;ref name="Decision-Making. p 92"/&gt;

=== Academic developments ===
A growing number of governmental, academic, and educational institutions around the globe have created policy, conducted studies, and created publications that respond to many of the insinuations and implications of adultism. Much of popular researcher [[Margaret Mead]]'s work can be said to be a response to adultism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Lisa M.|title=Child-Centered? Thinking Critically about Children's Drawings as a Visual Research Method|journal=Visual Anthropology Review|date=Spring 2006|volume=22|issue=1|page=68|doi=10.1525/var.2006.22.1.60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current researchers whose work analyzes the effects of adultism include sociologist [[Mike Males]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chu|first1=Julie|title=Navigating the Media Environment: How Youth Claim a Place Through Zines|journal=Social Justice|date=Fall 1997|volume=24|issue=3|pages=71–85|jstor=29767022}}&lt;/ref&gt; and critical theorist [[Henry Giroux]]. The topic has recently been addressed in [[liberation psychology]] literature, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watts|first1=Roderick J.|last2=Flanagan|first2=Constance|title=Pushing the envelope on youth civic engagement: A developmental and liberation psychology perspective|journal=Journal of Community Psychology|date=August 2007|volume=35|issue=6|pages=779–792|doi=10.1002/jcop.20178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Addressing adultism ==
Any inanimate or animate exhibition of adultism is said to be "adultist". This may include behaviors, policies, practices, institutions, or individuals.

Educator [[John Caldwell Holt|John Holt]] proposed that teaching adults about adultism is a vital step to addressing the effects of adultism,&lt;ref&gt;Holt, J. (2003) ''Teach Your Own'' Perseus Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one organization&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthonboard.org Youth On Board]&lt;/ref&gt; and one curriculum&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, A. &amp; Kivel, P. (1992) ''Helping Teens Stop Violence: A Practical Guide for Counselors, Educators, and Parents'' Hunter House.&lt;/ref&gt; do just that. Several educators have created curricula that seek to teach youth about adultism, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Miller-McLemore, B. (2003) ''Let the Children Come: Reimagining Childhood from a Christian Perspective'' Josey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, organizations responding to the negative effects of adultism include the United Nations, which has conducted a great deal of research&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120915074105/http://www.unicef-icdc.org/cgi-bin/unicef/Lunga.sql?ProductID=384 The Evolving Capacities of the Child] UNICEF. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to recognizing the need to [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|counter adultism]] through policy and programs. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]] has particular Articles (5 and 12) which are specifically committed to combating adultism. The international organization Human Rights Watch has done the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2005/us1005/6.htm The Difference between Youth and Adults] HRW online.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common practice accepts the engagement of [[youth voice]] and the formation of [[youth-adult partnership]]s as essential steps to resisting adultism.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) [http://freechild.org/adultism.htm Adultism Resources] The Freechild Project website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ways to challenge adultism also include youth-led programming and participating in [[List of youth organizations|youth-led organizations]]. These are both ways of children stepping up and taking action to call out the bias towards adults. Youth-led programming allows the voices of the youth to be heard and taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;https://freechild.org/adultism/&lt;/ref&gt; Taking control of their autonomy can help children take control of their sexuality, as well. Moving away from an adultist framework leads to moving away from the idea that children aren't capable of handling information about sex and their own sexuality. Accepting that children are ready to learn about themselves will decrease the amount of misinformation spread to them by their peers and allow them to receive accurate information from individuals educated on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;http://taasa.org/lets-talk-about-sex/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

In its most extreme form, the target of the advocates of addressing adultism is "the more or less conscious, uncontrolled, and covert exercise of power over the child by the adult ... this wielding of power by adults"&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of Being a Child'' (1995) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; ''per se''. Such an attack on ''any'' adult power may be fuelled by what has been called "the ''homunculus'' idea about children ... to many grown-ups a child is a Small Adult. They do not understand that a child carries different kinds of problems than an adult does".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1976) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

In its milder form, "adultism is about the misuse of power and does not refer to the normal responsibilities of adults in relation to children".&lt;ref&gt;M.-N. Beaudoin/M. Taylor, ''Breaking the Culture of Bullying and Disrespect'' (2004) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, "addressing adultism is not about reversing the power structure ... [or] completely eradicating it": rather, "shedding adultism involves a negotiation of decisions".&lt;ref&gt;Beaudoin, p. 129-30&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angel Ivanovich Bogdanovich''' ({{lang-ru|А́нгел Ива́нович Богдано́вич}}, October 14 [o.s. 2], 1860, [[Vitebsk Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (modern [[Belarus]]) - April 6 [o.s. March 24], 1907, [[Saint Petersburg]], Russian Empire) was a Russian [[literary critic]], [[publicist]] and social activist, originally a [[narodnik]], later an active member of the [[Legal Marxism|Legal Marxists]]' political group.&lt;ref name="bio_dic"&gt;{{cite web | author = | date = 2000| url  = http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/biograf2/1667|title = Bogdanovich, Angel Ivanovich| publisher  = Biographical Dictionary| accessdate = 2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gse"&gt;{{cite web | author =| date = 1969–1978| url  = http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/bse/69920/%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87|title = Bogdanovich, Angel Ivanovich| publisher  = The Great Soviet Encyclopedia| accessdate = 2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Angel Bogdanovich was born in [[Vitebsk]], an heir to a noble family of the [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Lithuania]]n origins. In 1880 he enrolled into the [[Kiev University]]. As a student of the medical faculty, he became a member of a Narodnik political circle, was expelled and got deported to the [[Nizny Novgorod]] [[governorate]]. There he became friends with [[Vladimir Korolenko]] and started contributing to several [[Privolzhye]] journals. In 1887 he moved to [[Kazan]], there he edited the ''Volzhsky Vesnik'' newspaper. In 1893, now a [[Saint Petersburg]] resident, he founded there Narodnoye Pravo (People's Right) group and issued its political program in a brochure called ''Nasushchny Vopros'' (A Vital Question, 1894).&lt;ref name="gse"/&gt;

In the mid-1890s Bogdanovich drifted away from Narodniks and became a member of the Legal Marxists group. In the early 1890s Bogdanovich regularly contributed to ''[[Russkoye Bogatstvo]]'', in 1894-1906 was a co-editor of and a key figure in ''[[Mir Bozhiy]]''. In 1906 ''Mir Bozhiy'' was closed but re-emerged as ''Sovremenny Mir'' (Modern World) and for a year Bogdanovich was its editor.

Angel Bogdanovich died in Saint Petersburg on April 6, 1907.&lt;ref name="bio_dic"/&gt;

'''Bornholm's Self-Government Party''' ({{lang-da|Bornholms Selvstyre parti}}) is a [[List of regional and local political parties in Denmark|local political party]] in [[Denmark]], which seeks to establish the independence or autonomy of [[Bornholm]], a small island in the [[Baltic Sea]] with a population of slightly below 40,000 people.&lt;ref name="Population"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=24 September 2014|title=Der bor nu under 40.000 på Bornholm|url=http://www.jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE7049169/der-bor-nu-under-40000-pa-bornholm/|newspaper=[[Jyllands-Posten]]|language=Danish|location=[[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]]|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in the 1990s, the party has seen only minor successes, securing at most a few hundred votes at a time.

==History==
Bornholm forms part of the ancient [[Lands of Denmark]], many of which were originally [[petty kingdom]]s or chiefdoms. It's the official stance of the Bornholm's Self-Government Party that the island was governed by its own petty king during the [[Viking Age]].&lt;ref name="Sprogmuseet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sprogmuseet.dk/religion/biblijn-pa-borrijnholmsk/|title=Biblijn på borrijnholmsk|last=Dahl|first=Camilla Luise|date=12 February 2012|website=www.sprogmuseet.dk|language=Danish|publisher=Danish Language Museum|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Bornholm ended up hotly contested ground between different Danish factions, and the site of frequent battles. During the 16th century, starting 1525, the island was pawned to [[Lübeck]] for 50 years. From 1624 and on it had its own militia, ''Bornholms Milits''. Ceded to [[Sweden]] – together with [[Scania]], to which it belonged, along with other provinces such as [[Bohuslän]] – in the 1658 [[Treaty of Roskilde]], the island's population threw out the Swedes the same year. As a reward for returning to King [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]], Bornholm received a promise never to be ceded again. First occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[Second World War]], Bornholm saw heavy damage during the war, and was also [[Bornholm#Soviet Occupation 1945–1946|occupied]] by the [[Soviet Union]] until 1946.

Since the Second World War, Bornholm has seen a demographic decline, with a large drop in population numbers and birth rates, as well as employment issues.&lt;ref name="Population"/&gt; Due to these issues, and in response to the taxes paid by Bornholm to the central government, the master builder Tonny Borrinjaland founded Bornholm's Self-Government Party in the early 1990s. It has since participated in six municipal elections, gaining 299 votes in the [[Danish local elections, 2009|2009 elections]] and 190 votes in [[Danish local elections, 2013|2013]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bjerre Andersen|first1=Fredrik|last2=Ebdrup|first2=Niels|date=15 November 2009|title=Skæve og skægge - se valgets originaler|url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/politik/article4195029.ece|language=Danish|newspaper=[[Ekstra Bladet]]|location=[[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hansen|first=Bjarne|date=16 June 2012|title=Selvstyreparti søger partistøtte |url=http://www.bornholm.nu/?Id=43029 |language=Danish|newspaper=Bornholm.nu|location=[[Rønne]], [[Denmark]]|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Alsen Lauridsen|first=Michael|date=18 September 2014|title=Bornholmsk frihedskamp får næring fra Skotland|url=http://www.b.dk/nationalt/bornholmsk-frihedskamp-faar-naering-fra-skotland|language=Danish|newspaper=[[Berlingske]]|location=[[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the run-up to the September 2014 [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014]], the party expressed its sympathies for the cause of [[Scottish independence]], and stated that it had a lot to learn from the Scots. Party leader Borrinjaland also pointed to [[Malta]] and [[Singapore]] as two other models that Bornholm should learn from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=18 September 2014|title=Scottish vote inspires Bornholm's independence party|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/scottish-vote-inspires-bornholms-independence-party.10903.html|newspaper=[[The Copenhagen Post]]|location=[[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strongly in favour of preserving the endangered [[Bornholmsk dialect]], Borrinjaland has gone as far as to translate the [[New Testament]] to the local language. Commenting on his views regarding Bornholmsk, he stated: "Today, it is almost forbidden to talk Bornholmsk in kindergartens and schools on the island. That has Denmark with pure dictatorship taken care since many years. It's scandalous, I mean. Therefore, we must ensure that children learn the language, so they at least can choose whether to speak Bornholmsk or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krak|first=Nikolaj|date=23 December 2011|title=Bibelinj ee auersat tee ded bornholmska sprog|url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/kirke-tro/bibelinj-ee-auersat-tee-ded-bornholmska-sprog|language=Danish|newspaper=[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]|location=[[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borrinjaland was also purportedly behind the launch of the [[flag of Bornholm]], a red and green [[Nordic Cross flag]] designed by a local painter and published in a local newspaper in 1975.&lt;ref name="Sprogmuseet"/&gt;

In [[Transparency International]]'s Corruption Perceptions Index for 2014, it was ranked 161st out of 175 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = CORRUPTION PERCEPTIONS INDEX 2014: RESULTS| work =Transparency International| url = http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =CORRUPTION PERCEPTIONS INDEX 2013| work = Transparency International| url = http://www.transparency.org/cpi2013/results}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous year, it was at 163rd out of 177 countries. This marked a decline from its 2012 ranking, 150th out of 174 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = CORRUPTION PERCEPTIONS INDEX 2012| work = Transparency International| url = http://www.transparency.org/cpi2012/results}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Guinea-Bissau scored below the averages for both [[Africa]] and [[West Africa]] on the [[Mo Ibrahim Foundation]]’s Index of African Governance.&lt;ref name=trans&gt;{{cite web| title =OVERVIEW OF CORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION IN GUINEA-BISSAU| work = Transparency International| url =http://www.transparency.org/files/content/corruptionqas/Country_profile_Guinea_Bissau_2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heritage Foundation]] stated that corruption is characteristic of the Bissau-Guinean government and economy. Government mismanagement in Guinea-Bissau, according to Transparency International's 2014 report on the country, has “created an environment conducive to corruption on a grand scale.” There is a culture of impunity, and citizens have no right to access information.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Much of the corruption in Guinea-Bissau is related to the fact that the country is a hub of international [[drug trafficking]].&lt;ref name=free&gt;{{cite web| title =Guinea-Bissau| work =Freedom House| url =https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/guinea-bissau}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Abject poverty, state collapse, lack of means and endemic corruption,” states one source, “have made Guinea Bissau a heaven for the [[Colombia]]n drug lords.”&lt;ref name=upenn&gt;{{cite web| last =Horta| first =Loro| title =Guinea Bissau: Africa’s first narcostate| work =AFRICAN STUDIES CENTER - UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA| url =http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/guinbisauhorta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama greet His Excellency José Mário Vaz, President of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and Ms. Rosa Teixeira Goudiaby Vaz.jpg|thumb|120 px|left|U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady with President José Mário Vaz]]
A Transparency International report on Guinea-Bissau notes the systemic instability and mismanagement of the government, as testified to by the fact that none of its presidents has ever completed an entire term in office.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

A former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony and “one of the most fragile states in Africa,” the nation won its [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence|independence in 1974]] and has experienced several coups in the decades since then.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

In recent times, low economic growth has made it difficult for government officials to manage patronage networks and compensate cronies, thus feeding the growth of other forms of illegal self-enrichment, notably trafficking in drugs and [[Arms trafficking|weapons]]. These trafficking networks have made the country a hub for illegal commerce.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

There was some improvement in corruption between 2008 and 2011. Then, in 2012, the government was overthrown in a military coup, which brought an end to attempts to curb corruption and introduce other reforms. In 2014, voters elected [[José Mário Vaz]] to the presidency.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

==Drug trafficking==
The country has been a drug-trafficking hub since around the turn of the 21st century, and many of its political and military leaders are deeply involved in the drug trade. Illegal narcotics from [[Latin America]] make their way to [[Europe]] by way of Guinea-Bissau,&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; which the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) considers the world's only “narco-state.”&lt;ref name=spieg&gt;{{cite web| last =Smoltczyk| first =Alexander| title =Guinea-Bissau a 'Drug Trafficker's Dream'| work =Der Spiegel| date =Mar 8, 2013| url =http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/violence-plagues-african-hub-of-cocaine-trafficking-a-887306.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, Colombian drug cartels had, for the past three years, been using Guinea-Bissau as a major transit point for European trafficking. At that time, according to the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], 800-1000 kg of cocaine were being flown nightly into Guinea-Bissau with an additional amount coming in by sea.&lt;ref name=upenn/&gt;

Latin American cocaine barons, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' has explained, look for corrupt nations in convenient geographic locations, as ideal for trafficking drugs.&lt;ref name=spieg/&gt; Authorities in Guinea-Bissau who seek to curb the drug traffic lack the most basic equipment, such as vehicles and radios, and often have insufficient gasoline supplies.&lt;ref name=upenn/&gt; The country has no able or willing force for law and order, creating the ideal hub for narco-trafficking.&lt;ref name=upenn/&gt; It also has poorly enforced border, unmonitored airfields, and a weak civilian government. In addition, it virtually never extradites anyone, as evidenced by the case of murderer and hijacker [[George Wright (fugitive)|George Wright]], who after his conviction in the U.S. worked for years in Guinea-Bissau as a basketball coach.&lt;ref name=spieg/&gt;

==Government==
The government's fiscal operations are characterized by a lack of transparency, of predictability, of budgeting control,  collusion among government and key personnel, and of external controls over public spending. High-ranking officials in the country have accumulated “unprecedented wealth and influence” and enjoy a high degree of impunity.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Political corruption consists largely of involvement in narcotics trafficking. This involvement, according to Transparency International, has overhauled patronage systems in Guinea-Bissau, ultimately lessening the state's role in corruption scheme, weakening the government as a whole.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

===President===
Under the constitution, the President has extremely broad powers, including lawmaking authority and the ability to appoint judges. This makes it easy for him to abuse his power and accumulate wealth at the expense of the people. Critics have argued that the president's power should be limited in specific ways while the prime minister's, [[National People's Assembly (Guinea-Bissau)|parliament]]'s, attorney general's, the judiciary’s powers are strengthened and reinforced. Critics have also called for a merit-based civil service.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

===Military, police, and security forces===
Guinea-Bissau's security and law-enforcement sectors are vulnerable to corruption and interference by politicians. Inadequate pay scales for members of the police and correctional services make them more vulnerable to corruption. Criminality and brutality among Bissau-Guinean security forces are well documented, as are cases of senior officials bypassing police authority by releasing prisoners and confiscating cocaine. An unclear situation involving jurisdiction results in institutional conflicts, especially where criminal investigations are concerned.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Members of the police, security forces, and military are all involved in aiding and abetting the drug trade. For example, the military is engaged in leasing airbases and naval yards to drug traffickers, who have also rented islands to build front companies to mask plane movements. Also, the drug trade has helped breed a culture of intimidation and violence within the military.&lt;ref name=upenn/&gt;

===Judiciary===
The judiciary lacks adequate resources and training and also lacks independence. It does not pursue corruption charges. No one in the country has ever been prosecuted for or convicted of money laundering.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; The public largely distrusts the nation's court system, due to the high costs of seeking justice and the lack of ethics, that leads people to solve disputes outside the legal system.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Judicial corruption is a discouragement to business, according to roughly a quarter of companies that responded a [[World Bank]] 2006 Enterprise Survey.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; A 2001 [[Amnesty International]] report suggested that the dismissal of several Supreme Court judges and clerks were related to judicial decisions that displeased the government.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

==Impact on business==
In a 2006 World Bank survey, 44% of firms said that corruption was a major hinderance to business. In 2008, 27.6% of firms in Guinea-Bissau had been asked for bribes at least once; in Africa as a whole, the figure was 22.3%, and in the entire world, the figure was 17.4%. In the same year, fully 48.9% of firms in Guinea-Bissau said they had given “gifts” to win government contracts, as compared to 31.1% of firms in Africa generally. Almost two-thirds of firms in the country said they had been expected to bribe public officials in order to accomplish certain ends. For manufacturers operating in Guinea-Bissau, bribes could reach up to 4.4% of costs.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

==Anti-corruption efforts==
Guinea-Bissau has few institutions or laws that are intended to fight corruption. Like other countries in Francophone Africa, it lacks a formal ethics code, has an inadequate number of external auditors, and has weak quality control.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

The Committee Against Corruption, created in 1995, was intended to address and prevent acts of corruption within the government and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; The Court of Accounts, the leading audit institution, was introduced in 2006 to audit the accounts and budget of the Ministry of Finance.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; Guinea-Bissau has ratified several United Nations Conventions combatting corruption as well as the African Union’s Convention on Corruption.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; In 2008, Guinea-Bissau was found to be non-compliant with 34 of the 49 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) statutes, which cover such matters as due diligence and the criminalization of terrorism financing.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

In 2009, the country reformed its procurement system in conformity with West African Economic Monetary Union guidelines.This reform involved the establishment of a new regulatory body, the formation of a public procurement department, the institution of an audit unit to vet the central unit's procurement transactions, and  the introduction of a new procurement infrastructure.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

A new system for managing public expenditure, instituted in or shortly before 2010, helped control government expenses by obliging every government office to submit an annual budget and progress reports to parliament.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; As of 2011, the country planned a comprehensive set of anti-corruption reforms. After the 2012 military coup, however, reform efforts were ended.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Some drug arrests have been made, including arrests of military officials, but defendants have not been successfully prosecuted. In March 2012, former Procurator General announced investigations into the murders of President [[João Bernardo Vieira|João Vieira]] and the Commander of the military, General [[Tagme Na Waie]], had halted due to difficulty in gathering evidence.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

In August 2015, President Jose Mario Vaz dismissed Prime Minister [[Domingos Simões Pereira|Domingos Pereira]] and the members of his cabinet, accusing them of corruption, nepotism, and obstruction of justice.&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite web| title = Guinea-Bissau president dismisses government, accuses ministers of corruption, nepotism| work =Fox News| date =Aug 13, 2015| url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/08/13/guinea-bissau-president-dismisses-government-accuses-ministers-corruption.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN and GIABA helped establish Guinea-Bissau’s Financial Intelligence Unit, but its resources are too limited for it to be able to exercise its functions.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

===U.S. actions===
In April 2013, the US arrested the head of Guinea-Bissau's navy in international waters on drug-trafficking charges. He was receiving commissions of $1 million per ton for facilitating the shipment of illicit drugs into the US and Europe.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

In the same year, a US grand jury indicted the head of Guinea-Bissau's armed forces for trafficking cocaine and weapons.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

The '''Debt Conciliation Board''' (DCB) is the independent organ of the [[Government of Haryana]] for the implementation of ''The Haryana Relief Of Agricultural Indebtness Act, 1989''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://india.gov.in/allimpfrms/allacts/848.pdf | title=Govt. of India Press Release | accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It plays an important role in identifying the deserving candidates for providing relief and adequate benefits to them as per regulations.

==History==
In 2007 Budget the central government passed the law of waiving agricultural loans to the tune of {{Indian Rupees}}60,000 crore, and to distribute this relief the debt conciliation boards were set up by the Haryana government. The board was formed on 28 January 2007 by Chief Minister of Haryana BS Hooda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20081113/haryana.htm#7 | title=The Tribune, November | accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed to provide relief from huge debts to the poor farmers and labourers of Haryana. First it was decided to constitute a single board for the state of Haryana. But due to the presence of large population of benefitors it was decided to constitute this board in every district of Haryana.

==Hierarchy==
The board in each district is presided by Additional Deputy Commissioner. The District Revenue Officer and a representative of the financial institutions are the other official members. Further there are two non official Government representatives from each district of Haryana.
Non Official Members are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070129/haryana.htm#4 | title=The Tribune, 2008 | accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions in law==
The boards have been constituted under the Haryana Relief of Agricultural Indebtedness Act. Though the Act was enacted in 1989, the boards have been constituted to make the Act really effective. The boards have the jurisdiction to provide relief to debtors of not only a cooperative bank, cooperative society, nationalised bank or commercial bank, but also to the debtors of private creditors and money-lenders. Any debtor, who has paid more than double the principal amount, can approach the board. Section 3 (e) and 4 of the Act under which these boards were constituted provided rescheduling of the debts of farmers with regard to the repayment capacity of the debtor. Section 12 (5) provided that in case the debtor has repaid to the creditor an amount equal to or exceeding double the principal amount, or the debtor on being apprised of such findings pays an amount which makes total repayment equal to double the amount of principal, the board shall have the power to declare the debt as fully discharged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080302/haryana.htm#2 | title=The Tribune, March | accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

DCB has been often criticised for being ineffective in providing relief to the deserving candidates in Haryana. It has been alleged that the main reason behind the lackadaisical attitude of the government on this issue was that most political leaders had their own commission agent shops in various grain markets of the state and hence they acted as moneylenders to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080302/haryana.htm#2 | title=The Tribune, Criticism | accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="620">The '''Easter Crisis of 1948''' was the fear that the [[Soviet Union]] or Soviet-aligned [[Communist]]s were planning an [[invasion]] or [[coup d'état]] in [[Denmark]]. Until this crisis, Denmark had tried to remain neutral between east and west, but the fear of attack from the east caused Denmark to align with the west.

'''Eric Robert Rudolph''' (born September 19, 1966), also known as the '''Olympic Park Bomber''', is an American [[domestic terrorist]] convicted for a series of [[Anti-abortion violence|anti-abortion]] and [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]]-motivated [[Pipe bomb|bombing]]s across the [[southern United States]] between 1996 and 1998, which killed two people and injured over 120 others.&lt;ref name="FBI announcement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/1998/October/477crm.htm |title=Eric Rudolph charged in Centennial Olympic Park bombing |publisher=Usdoj.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030618150204/http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/1998/October/477crm.htm# |archive-date=June 18, 2003 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/08/rudolph.plea/|title=Rudolph agrees to plea agreement|last1=Schuster|first1=Henry|date=12 April 2005|publisher=Cable News Network LP, LLLP|accessdate=8 January 2016|quote="The many victims of Eric Rudolph's terrorist attacks in Atlanta and Birmingham can rest assured that Rudolph will spend the rest of his life behind bars," [U.S. Attorney General Alberto] Gonzales said in press release.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050409061947/http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/08/rudolph.plea/#|archive-date=April 9, 2005|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudolph spent five years on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list until he was caught in 2003. In 2005, as part of a [[plea bargain]], he pleaded guilty to numerous state and federal [[homicide]] charges and accepted four consecutive [[life imprisonment|life sentence]]s in exchange for avoiding a trial and a potential [[capital punishment|death sentence]].

After Rudolph received his GED, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, undergoing basic training at [[Fort Benning]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He was [[Military discharge|discharged]] in January 1989, while serving with the [[101st Airborne Division]] at [[Fort Campbell]] in [[Kentucky]], due to [[marijuana]] use.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Gettleman with David M. Halbfinger, ''[[The New York Times]]'', [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/01/us/suspect-in-96-olympic-bombing-and-3-other-attacks-is-caught.html "Suspect in '96 Olympic Bombing And 3 Other Attacks Is Caught"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204132818/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/01/us/suspect-in-96-olympic-bombing-and-3-other-attacks-is-caught.html# |date=February 4, 2017 }}, June 1, 2003. Retrieved December 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the year before his discharge, Rudolph had attended the [[United States Army Air Assault School|Air Assault School]] at Fort Campbell. He attained the rank of [[Specialist (rank)|specialist]]/E-4.

==Bombings==
At age 29, Rudolph was the perpetrator of the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]] in [[Atlanta]], which occurred on July 27, 1996, during the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. He called the police, warning about the bomb before it detonated. The blast killed spectator Alice Hawthorne and wounded 111 others. Melih Uzunyol, a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[cinematographer|cameraman]], who ran to the scene following the blast, died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Rudolph's motive for the bombings, according to his April 13, 2005 statement, was political:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the summer of 1996, the world converged upon Atlanta for the Olympic Games. Under the protection and auspices of the regime in Washington millions of people came to celebrate the ideals of global socialism. Multinational corporations spent billions of dollars, and Washington organized an army of security to protect these best of all games. Even though the conception and the purpose of the so-called Olympic movement is to promote the values of global socialism as perfectly expressed in the song "Imagine" by John Lennon, which was the theme of the 1996 Games—even though the purpose of the Olympics is to promote these ideals, the purpose of the attack on July 27 was to confound, anger and embarrass the Washington government in the eyes of the world for its abominable sanctioning of abortion on demand.

The plan was to force the cancellation of the games, or at least create a state of insecurity to empty the streets around the venues and thereby eat into the vast amounts of money invested.&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rudolph's statement authoritatively cleared [[Richard Jewell]], a Centennial Olympic Park security guard, of any involvement in the bombing. Despite having been initially hailed as a hero for being the first one to spot Rudolph's explosive device and helping to clear the area, Jewell fell under suspicion of participating in the bombing a few days after the incident when he came under FBI suspicion for involvement in the crime, becoming the prime suspect and an international news story.

Rudolph has also confessed to three other bombings: an abortion clinic in the Atlanta suburb of [[Sandy Springs, Georgia|Sandy Springs]] on January 16, 1997; the Otherside Lounge of Atlanta, a [[gay bar|lesbian bar]], on February 21, 1997, injuring five;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130414003813/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2005/April/05_crm_176.htm Eric Robert Rudolph To Plead Guilty To Serial Bombing Attacks In Atlanta And Birmingham; Will Receive Life Sentences] April 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and an abortion clinic in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] on January 29, 1998, killing [[Birmingham Police Department (Alabama)|Birmingham police officer]] and part-time clinic security guard Robert Sanderson, and critically injuring nurse [[Emily Lyons]]. Rudolph's [[nail bomb|bombs contained nails]] which acted as [[fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].

==Fugitive==
Rudolph was first identified as a suspect in the Alabama bombing by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] on February 14, 1998, following tips from two witnesses, Jeffrey Tickal and Jermaine Hughes. Tickal and Hughes observed Rudolph departing the scene and noted his appearance and truck license plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=They Didn't Catch Rudolph, but They Stopped Him Cold|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/15/nation/na-witness15|accessdate=16 April 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=15 April 2005|author=Ellen Barry|author2=Jenny Jarvie|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227092743/http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/15/nation/na-witness15#|archive-date=December 27, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was named as a suspect in the three Atlanta incidents on October 14, 1998.

On May 5, 1998, he became the 454th fugitive listed by the FBI on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1990s|Ten Most Wanted]] list. The FBI considered him to be armed and extremely dangerous, and offered a $1 million reward for information leading directly to his arrest. He spent more than five years in the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] wilderness as a fugitive, during which time federal and amateur search teams scoured the area without success.

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] noted that "extremist chatter on the Internet has praised Rudolph as 'a hero' and some followers of [[hate group]]s are calling for further acts of violence to be modeled after the bombings he is accused of committing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Anti-Defamation League]], "[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Teror_92/4264_72.htm Extremist Chatter Praises Eric Rudolph as 'Hero.'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124235649/http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Teror_92/4264_72.htm |date=November 24, 2006 }}", June 3, 2003.

==Arrest and guilty plea==
[[File:Florence ADMAX.jpg|thumb|[[Florence ADMAX USP]], where Rudolph is incarcerated]]
Rudolph was arrested in [[Murphy, North Carolina]], on May 31, 2003, by [[rookie]] police officer Jeffrey Scott Postell of the Murphy Police Department while Rudolph was looking through a dumpster behind a [[Save-A-Lot]] store at about 4 a.m.; Postell, on routine patrol, had initially suspected a burglary in progress.&lt;ref name="CNN captured"&gt;{{cite news |title=Atlanta Olympic bombing suspect arrested|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/05/31/rudolph.main/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030621163319/http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/05/31/rudolph.main/|archivedate=June 21, 2003|date=May 31, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudolph was unarmed and did not resist arrest. When arrested, he was clean-shaven with a trimmed mustache, had dyed black hair and wore a camouflage jacket, work clothes, and new sneakers.&lt;ref name="CNN captured"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Finally caught: 5 year hunt for Eric Rudolph ends|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/rudolph/0603/01main.html|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=December 7, 2013|author1=Torpy, Bill |author2=Plummer, Don|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030605155128/http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/rudolph/0603/01main.html|archivedate=June 5, 2003|date=June 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal authorities charged him on October 14, 2003. Rudolph was initially defended by attorney [[Richard S. Jaffe]]. After Jaffe withdrew, he was represented by [[Judy Clarke]].

On April 8, 2005, the Department of Justice announced that Rudolph had agreed to a plea bargain under which he would plead guilty to all charges he was accused of in exchange for avoiding the death penalty. The deal was confirmed after the FBI found {{convert|250|lb}} of [[dynamite]] he hid in the forests of [[North Carolina]]. His revealing the hiding places of the dynamite was a condition of his plea agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eggen|first=Dan|title=Rudolph To Plead Guilty to Bombings|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37544-2005Apr8.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 7, 2013|date=April 9, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630002149/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37544-2005Apr8.html#|archive-date=June 30, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He made his pleas in person in Birmingham and Atlanta courts on April 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lohr|first=Kathy|title=Rudolph Pleads Guilty, Admits Little Remorse|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4599872|publisher=NPR|accessdate=December 7, 2013|date=April 13, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213150211/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4599872#|archive-date=December 13, 2013|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudolph released a statement explaining his actions; he rationalized the bombings as serving the cause of [[pro-life|anti-abortion]] and [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] activism. In his statement, he claimed that he had "deprived the government of its goal of sentencing me to death," and that "the fact that I have entered an agreement with the government is purely a tactical choice on my part and in no way legitimates the [[moral authority]] of the government to judge this matter or impute my guilt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-04-13-rudolph-statement_x.htm |title=Excerpts from Eric Rudolph's statement |date=April 13, 2005 |newspaper=USA Today |access-date=August 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211085812/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-04-13-rudolph-statement_x.htm# |archive-date=February 11, 2009 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations==
Rudolph has made it clear in his written statement and elsewhere that the purpose of the bombings was to fight against abortion and the "[[homosexual agenda]]." He considered abortion to be murder, the product of a "rotten feast of materialism and self-indulgence"; accordingly, he believed that its perpetrators deserved death, and that the United States government had lost its legitimacy by sanctioning it. He also considered it essential to resist by force "the concerted effort to legitimize the practice of homosexuality" in order to protect "the integrity of American society" and "the very existence of our culture", whose foundation is the "family hearth."&lt;ref name=fulltext&gt;[http://www.armyofgod.com/EricRudolphStatement.html Full text of Eric Rudolph's written statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028003642/http://www.armyofgod.com/EricRudolphStatement.html# |date=October 28, 2006 }} Army of God website&lt;/ref&gt;

Essays written by Rudolph that condone violence and militant action have been published on the Internet by an Army of God anti-abortion activist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armyofgod.com/EricRudolphHomepage.html Army of God's homepage for Rudolph] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516044053/http://www.armyofgod.com/EricRudolphHomepage.html# |date=May 16, 2007 }} December 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While victims maintain that Rudolph's messages are harassment and could incite violence, according to [[Alice Martin]], [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama|United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama]] when Rudolph was prosecuted for the [[Alabama]] bombing, the prison can do little to restrict their publication. "An inmate does not lose his [[Freedom of speech in the United States|freedom of speech]]," she said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2007May14/0,4670,EricRudolph,00.html Extremist Taunts His Victims From Prison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516044017/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2007May14/0,4670,EricRudolph,00.html |date=May 16, 2007 }} May 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Escambray rebellion''' was a six-year rebellion (1959–1965) in the [[Escambray Mountains]] by a group of insurgents who opposed the [[Cuba]]n government led by [[Fidel Castro]].

The rebelling group of insurgents was a mix of former [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] soldiers, local farmers, and former allied guerrillas who had fought alongside Castro against Batista during the [[Cuban Revolution]]. The end result was the elimination of all insurgents by Cuban government forces in 1965. The Cuban government describes rebellion as "War Against the Bandits" ({{lang-es| Lucha contra Bandidos}}).

==Rebellion==
===Beginning===
The uprising began almost immediately after the success of the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959. It was led by former anti-Batista revolutionaries that rejected the Castro coup and the ensuing close ties to the [[Soviet Union]] and local peasants who were disenchanted by the Communist government's expropriation of their farmlands. The insurgent ''guajiro'' rural farmers were aided by some former [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]]'s forces, but were mostly led by former [[Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil]] rebels (13 March Movement), such as [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] [[Osvaldo Ramirez]] and Comandante [[William Alexander Morgan]], both of whom had fought Batista's ''casquitos'' in the same area only a few years before (Morgan himself was executed in 1961 long before the resistance ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/william-morgan.htm | title = William Morgan | publisher = Latin American Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurgency===
The [[CIA]] provided some aid to the insurgents, but withdrew all support after the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in 1961, ensuring their ultimate defeat. Some of the failures could be attributed to Castro’s "roll up" of CIA operatives in Cuba.&lt;ref name = "Volkman"&gt;Volkman, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Osvaldo Ramirez returned to the [[Escambray Mountains]] and declined an offer by Fidel Castros' emissary, Comandante Faure Chomón, to surrender. According to [[Miguel Faria|Dr. Miguel A. Faria]], Chomon had been Ramirez's chief in the Revolutionary Directorate in the Escambray during the guerrilla war against Batista.&lt;ref&gt;Faria, [http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/1/11/142641.shtml Cuba in Revolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720000718/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/1/11/142641.shtml |date=2008-07-20 }} (2002), pp. 88–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban government's main tactic was to deploy thousands of troops against small groups of rebels, forming progressively constricting rings of encirclement.&lt;ref name = "Encinosa"&gt;Encinosa, Unvanquished, pp. 73–86.&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist leaders that Castro sent to clear the Escambray Mountains were ordered to exterminate the rebels. They were to "comb the brush, elbow to elbow" until they had completely cleared the hills of anticommunist rebels.&lt;ref name="NewsMax"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/11/18/152446.shtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20021121143157/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/11/18/152446.shtml | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2002-11-21 | title = Cuban War Criminal Touring US: Victor Dreke and the Real Story of the Escambray Wars | last = Faria Jr, MD | first = Miguel A | publisher = NewsMax | accessdate = 2007-12-24 | date = 2002-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the Cuban counter-insurgent forces ''Lucha contra Bandidos'' (LCB) were Commandantes Raul Menendez Tomassevich, founding member of the [[Cuban Communist Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.blythe.org/nytransfer-subs/2001-Caribbean-Vol-3/Cuban_General_Raul_Tomassevich_Dies | title = Cuban General Raul Menendez Tomassevich Dies | publisher = Associated Press | accessdate = 2007-12-24 | date = 2001-08-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081022125155/http://www.blythe.org/nytransfer-subs/2001-Caribbean-Vol-3/Cuban_General_Raul_Tomassevich_Dies | archivedate = 2008-10-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lizardo Proenza.&lt;ref name = "Escambray"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/book/escambray-27.htm | title = Escambray: La Guerra Olvidada | last = Encinosa | first = Enrique G | publisher = Latin American Studies | pages = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Che"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.escambray.cu/che/montanas.html | title = Montañas | publisher = Escambray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Secretos"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://secretoscuba.cultureforum.net/Informacion-General-c3/Crimenes-de-Fidel-Castro-f20/TODO-SOBRE-LA-GUERRA-EN-EL-ESCAMBRAY-p45803.htm | title = Todo Sobre la Guerra en el Escambray | publisher = Secretos de Cuba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defeat===
Superior numbers and the lack of outside assistance, particularly supplies, led to the rebels' defeat.&lt;ref name = "Faria"&gt;Faria, Cuba in Revolution, pp. 88–93.&lt;/ref&gt; The outnumbered anticommunist guerrillas often fought to the death.&lt;ref name = "Hacienda Publishing"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://haciendapublishing.com/articles/interview-dr-miguel-faria-part-i-myles-b-kantor | title = Interview With Dr. Miguel Faria (Part I) by Myles Kantor | last = Faria Jr, MD | first = Miguel A | publisher = Hacienda Publishing | accessdate = 2002-06-14 | date = 2002-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban forces used sweeps by long columns of [[National Revolutionary Militias|militia]], which cost the government substantial losses but ultimately won the war. Spanish-Soviet advisor [[Francisco Ciutat de Miguel]], who was also present at the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], played a major role in the pacification operation. Castro employed overwhelming force, at times sending in as many as 250,000 government troops.&lt;ref name="Cubanet"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y02/may02/30a6.htm | title = Cuba News | publisher = Cuba Net | date = 2002-05-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051205154606/http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y02/may02/30a6.htm | archivedate = 2005-12-05 | df =  }} (see Puebla).&lt;/ref&gt; The insurgency was eventually crushed by the Castros' use of vastly superior numbers. Some of the insurgents ultimately surrendered, but they were immediately executed by firing squad. Only a handful managed to escape.&lt;ref name = "NewsMax" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Escambray 18"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/book/escambray-18.htm | title = Escambray: La Guerra Olvidada | last = Encinosa | first = Enrique G. | pages = 18 | publisher = Latin American Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Franqui"&gt;Franqui (1984), pp. 111–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The War Against the Bandits actually lasted longer and involved more soldiers than had the previous struggle against Batista's forces.&lt;ref name = "Ros"&gt;Ros (2006) pp. 159–201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cuba"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Cuba Bandits: terrorism in past tense |url=http://www.escambray.cu/Eng/Bandits/FpasadoE.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222204658/http://www.escambray.cu/Eng/Bandits/FpasadoE.htm |archivedate=2007-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban government combat leader [[Víctor Dreke|Victor Dreke]] gave a pro-Castro viewpoint in his 2002 book ''From el Escambray to the Congo''. This is notable for its virulent condemnation of former comrades from the war against Batista.&lt;ref name = "Cubela"&gt;Dreke 2002 p. 68 ‘Cubela… traitor to the revolution’; p. 93 ‘nearly all… counter revolutionaries’; p. 95 ‘William Morgan raped’.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dreke also describes the tactics and mindset of the Cuban government forces and its ruthless use of force and no-prisoners attitude.

Raul Castro claimed in a speech in 1970 that the rebellion killed 500 members of the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]]; the death toll of the rebels and others involved in the rebellion (such as civilians and pro-government militias) are unknown. Estimates for total combatant deaths range from 1,000 to 7,000.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Swanger. "Rebel Lands of Cuba: The Campesino Struggles of Oriente and Escambray, 1934–1974." Page 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''First Peoples National Party of Canada''' (FPNPC) was a registered [[Federation|federal]] [[political party]] in [[Canada]].  It intends to advance the lives of the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]] getting involved in the federal electoral process, engage the public on Indigenous issues, and calling upon the grassroots to get involved by nominating candidates for election in [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral districts]] with large Aboriginal populations. The party ran candidates in 3 federal elections between 2006 and 2011. The party was voluntarily deregistered by [[Elections Canada]] on July 5, 2013, with then-leader [[Will Morin]] asserting that the party's purpose had been supplanted by the emergence of the [[Idle No More]] activist movement.

==Background==
The FPNPC held its first organizational meeting in October 2004 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The similarly minded [[Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada]] began organizing independently in the summer of 2005.  Although the parties contrasted somewhat in their desire to work closely with or at arm's-length from national aboriginal organizations such as the [[Assembly of First Nations]], it is believed{{By whom|date=February 2011}} that the two parties have merged their applications for registration to facilitate gaining [[Elections Canada]] recognition.  One of the conditions of that agreement was a national convention in which the party's name would be put to the membership for a vote.

In the fall of 2005 the FPNP filed its application for registration as a political party, with all requirements met we received the title "eligible for party status," waiting on the next federal election. The party nominated five candidates in [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]]. On December 26, 2005, Will Morin, an Ojibway from Michipicoten First Nation was the first of these 5 candidates to be officially registered by Elections Canada. This registration, during a federal election, made the FPNP an official political party.

Barbara Wardlaw, an [[Ojibwa]] from the [[Michipicoten First Nation]] near [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sootoday.com/content/news/full_story.asp?StoryNumber=11828 "Saultite spearheads new national political party"]. [[Sootoday.com]], June 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; served as the party's interim leader in the 2006 and 2008 elections. She was succeeded by [[Will Morin]], who also serves as leader on an interim basis.&lt;ref&gt;First Perspective: [http://www.firstperspective.ca/fp_template.php?path=20060502first First candidate tosses hat in the ring for Aboriginal Peoples Party leader] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519161758/http://www.firstperspective.ca/fp_template.php?path=20060502first |date=2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morin was the party's only candidate in the 2011 election, receiving 0.50 percent of the votes in the riding of [[Sudbury (electoral district)|Sudbury]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8770">The '''First Peoples Party''' (FPP) was a short-lived political-party in [[Manitoba]], Canada.

==History==

The FPP was created following a 1993 resolution by the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, endorsing a political party to focus on [[Aboriginal peoples in Manitoba|aboriginal]] issues.&lt;ref name="Aboriginal"&gt;"Aboriginal party in Manitoba would be open to all", Financial Post, 30 November 1994, P. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The party was officially founded in November 1994, and fielded three candidates in the [[Manitoba general election, 1995|1995 provincial election]].  The FPP was not registered with [[Elections Manitoba]], and its candidates appeared on the ballot as independents.

The FPP argued that all aboriginal peoples in Canada possess an inherent right to self-government, and claimed the established political parties were not giving sufficient attention to aboriginal concerns.&lt;ref name="Aboriginal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Taylor, "Native North shops for any port in a storm", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 April 1995, City Page.&lt;/ref&gt; The party also highlighted issues of sustainable development and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;David Roberts, "Manitoba natives form own party", ''Globe and Mail'', 29 November 1994, A4.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jerry Fontaine]] was recognized as the party's leader, although it is not clear if he held an official title within the party.  A former [[Manitoba Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] candidate, Fontaine emphasized that the FPP was open to all Manitobans and not only those of aboriginal background.&lt;ref name="Aboriginal"/&gt;

Some members of Manitoba's aboriginal community opposed the FPP's creation.  [[George Hickes (Manitoba politician)|George Hickes]], a [[Manitoba New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) legislator of [[Inuit]] background, argued that the principle of an aboriginal party is inappropriate for Canada's constituency-based electoral system.  Elected politicians, he argued, are required to represent diverse communities.  Referring to his own ethnically diverse [[Point Douglas]] constituency, Hickes said, "You have Ukrainians, Filipinos, Chinese.  What happens to them... if you're running to represent only one group of people?"&lt;ref name="Aboriginal"/&gt;

The FPP was largely unsuccessful as a political party.  Fontaine ran a credible campaign in the vast northern constituency of [[Kewatinook|Rupertsland]], but nonetheless finished in fourth place with 541 votes.  Una Truscott received 262 votes in the [[Winnipeg]] constituency of [[Broadway (electoral district)|Broadway]], while Lyle Morrisseau received 105 votes in neighbouring Point Douglas.  The NDP won all three constituencies.

In the middle of the campaign, two candidates from a separate party called [[Independent Native Voice]] also joined the FPP: Nelson Contois and his daughter Carey Contois.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Owen, "First Nations political parties join forces", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', 15 April 1995, City Page.&lt;/ref&gt;  Three years later, allegations arose that the Contois candidacies were sponsored by [[Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba|Progressive Conservative Party]] organizers to encourage vote-splitting with the NDP.  The FPP was not implicated in this scandal.&lt;ref&gt;The INV controversy is analysed extensively in Doug Smith, ''As Many Liars'', (Winnipeg: Arbeiter Ring Publishing), 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Peoples Party dissolved after the 1995 election.  Fontaine subsequently rejoined the Liberals, and ran for [[Manitoba Liberal Party leadership elections|the leadership of that party]] in 1998. He was defeated by [[Jon Gerrard]].

In 2000, a separate First Peoples Party was founded in [[British Columbia]] under the leadership of Don Moss.  This was later renamed as the [[All Nations Party of British Columbia]].  A federal [[First Peoples National Party of Canada]] was established in 2005, based in part on the FPP.

==FPP candidates==

===Una Truscott (Broadway)===

Truscott was the first candidate nominated for the FPP.  She was a 28-year-old university student at the time of the election, and her campaign focused on sustainable development and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Press, "First Nations party fields candidate in Broadway riding", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', 30 March 1995, City Page.&lt;/ref&gt;  She received 262 votes (4.01%), finishing fourth in a field of four candidates.  The winner was [[Conrad Santos]] of the New Democratic Party.

Truscott later worked as the Aboriginal Public Administration Program Intern for the Office of the Children's Advocate of Manitoba,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrensadvocate.mb.ca/English/Annual%20Report%202001%20Eng.pdf Manitoba Children's Advocate: Annual Report], 2001-2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and became the Aboriginal Cultural and Spiritual Liaison at the St. Amant Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndpcaucus.mb.ca/mlas/st_norbert/community/pages/snapshot5.htm "Honouring the Sacred Community Gathering Powwow"], Website of [[Marilyn Brick]], MLA, accessed 13 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lyle Morrisseau (Point Douglas)===

Morrisseau is a member of the [[Sagkeeng]] First Nation, and also holds the name Kah Kimi Watha Pimi Whata (Day Walker).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/010/0001/0001/0012/0002/0036/s18_e.htm Presentation by Mr. Lyle Morrisseau and Mr. Gilbert Abraham, Sagkeeng First Nation], Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;  He served on the student council of the [[Saskatchewan Indian Federated College]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legassembly.sk.ca/hansard/21L4S/900405.PDF Hansard, Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan], 5 April 1990. (Morrisseau's last name is misspelled)&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1994, he was a spokesman for the 1992 Committee Supporting 500 Years of Indigenous Resistance at an anti-[[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) rally in Winnipeg.  Morrisseau endorsed the actions of indigenous rebels in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Chiapas]], and drew parallels between the conditions of aboriginal people in Mexico, Canada and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Brad Oswald, "Rally slams NAFTA", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', 11 January 1994, City Page.&lt;/ref&gt;

He received 105 votes (2.14%) in the 1995 election, finishing fourth against New Democratic Party candidate George Hickes.  Soon after the election, Morrisseau participated in a protest by the [[Nuxalk]] nation in [[British Columbia]] against local logging activities as a representative of the First Nations Environmental Network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepeoplespaths.net/articles/nuxblck.htm Marsha Shaiman, "Nuxalk Nation blockades logging company", accessed 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrisseau remained active with environmental issues after 1995.  In 1997, he spoke out against the burial of nuclear waste on aboriginal land.&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Morrisseau and Abraham.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Morrisseau and [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) officer Ron MacRae used [[CPR]] to revive a trucker whom witnessed initially believed was dead at the scene of an accident.  The newspaper report of this incident listed Morrisseau as living in [[Fort Alexander, Manitoba|Fort Alexander]], Manitoba.&lt;ref&gt;Duff Marshall, "CPR training pays off at accident site", ''Regina Leader Post'', 7 October 2000, A3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jerry Fontaine (Rupertsland)===

Fontaine received 541 votes (12.22%), finishing fourth against NDP candidate [[Eric Robinson (Canadian politician)|Eric Robinson]].

'''Forty Acres and a Mule''' refers to a promise made in the United States for [[agrarian reform]] to former enslaved black farmers by Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] on January 16, 1865. It followed a series of conversations between Secretary of War [[Edwin M. Stanton]] and [[Radical Republican]] abolitionists [[Charles Sumner]] and [[Thaddeus Stevens]]&lt;ref name="Gates" /&gt; following disruptions to the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] provoked by the [[American Civil War]]. Many [[freedmen]] believed and were told by various political figures that they had a right to own the land they had long worked as slaves, and were eager to control their own property. Freed people widely expected to legally claim {{convert|40|acre|ha}} of land (a quarter-quarter [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]]) and a [[mule]] after the end of the war, long after proclamations such as [[Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15]] and the [[Freedmen's Bureau bills|Freedmen's Bureau Act]] were explicitly reversed.

Some land redistribution occurred under military jurisdiction during the war and for a brief period thereafter. However, federal and state policy during the [[Reconstruction era]] emphasized wage labor, not land ownership, for blacks. Almost all land allocated during the war was restored to its pre-war white owners. Several black communities did maintain control of their land, and some families obtained new land by [[Homestead Acts|homesteading]]. Black land ownership increased markedly in [[Mississippi]] during the 19th century, particularly. The state had much undeveloped bottomland behind riverfront areas that had been cultivated before the war. Most blacks acquired land through private transactions, with ownership peaking at {{convert|15000000|acre|ha}} in 1910, before an extended financial recession caused problems that resulted in the loss of their property for many.

==Background==
{{Slavery}}
The institution of slavery in the United States deprived multiple generations of the opportunity to own land. Legally, slaves could not own property, but in practice they did acquire capital — and generally perceived themselves as the lowest-ranking members of the capitalist system.&lt;ref name=Mitchell523&gt;Mitchell, ''From Reconstruction to Deconstruction'' (2001), pp. 523–524.&lt;/ref&gt; As legal slavery came to an end, many freed people fully expected to gain ownership of the land they had worked.&lt;ref name=Mitchell523 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Foner277 /&gt;

[[African Americans]] in the U.S. faced severe discrimination, and were maintained as a distinct racial group by laws against "[[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|miscegenation]]".&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, ''Brief Treatment of the Free Negro'' (1925), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived as a threat to society, and particularly as a dangerous influence on slaves, free Negroes had not been welcome in most areas of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, ''Brief Treatment of the Free Negro'' (1925), pp. xvi–xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Civil War, most free blacks lived in the North, which had abolished slavery. In some places they acquired substantial real estate.&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, ''Brief Treatment of the Free Negro'' (1925), pp. xx, xxxviii–xl.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the South, vagrancy laws had allowed the states to force free Negroes into labor, and sometimes to sell them into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, ''Brief Treatment of the Free Negro'' (1925), pp. xxiiv–xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WoodsonXli /&gt; Nevertheless, free Africans across the country performed a variety of occupations, and a small number owned and operated successful farms.&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, ''Brief Treatment of the Free Negro'' (1925), pp. xxxvi, xlii–xliii.&lt;/ref&gt; Others settled in [[Southern Ontario]] and [[Black Nova Scotians|Nova Scotia]], possible endpoints of the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref name=WoodsonXli&gt;Woodson, ''Brief Treatment of the Free Negro'' (1925), pp. xli–xlii.&lt;/ref&gt;

White [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] did not agree on how freed people ought to be treated. While some advocated full redistribution of land, others did not support any type of race mixing. Plans for a colony began in 1801 when [[James Monroe]] asked President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to help create a penal colony for rebellious blacks.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, "The Persistence of the Idea of Negro Colonization" (1943), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lacy K. Ford, ''Deliver Us from Evil: The Slavery Question in the Old South''; Oxford University Press, 2009, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xEC9K7quBoEC&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 62].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Colonization Society]] formed in 1816 to address the issue of free African Americans through resettlement abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, ''Brief Treatment of the Free Negro'' (1925), pp. xl–xli.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1860, the ACS had settled thousands of Africans in [[Liberia]]. But colonization was slow and unappealing to many, and as mass emancipation loomed there was no clear understanding of what might happen to millions of soon-to-be-free blacks.&lt;ref name=Dyer55 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bonekemper171 /&gt; This issue had long been known to white authorities as "The Negro Problem".&lt;ref name=Bonekemper171 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, "The Persistence of the Idea of Negro Colonization" (1943), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a land grant to an entire class of people was not so unusual in the 1700s and 1800s as it seems today. For example, Thomas Jefferson proposed a grant of 50 acres to any free man who didn't already have at least 50 acres in his draft of a revolutionary constitution for Virginia in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Draft Constitution of Virginia, 1776 http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/jeffcons.asp&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, various [[Homestead Acts]] were passed 1862–1916, granting 160–640 acres (a quarter section to a full section), depending on the act, and earlier homesteading occurred under statutues such as the [[Preemption Act of 1841]]. Freedmen were not generally eligible for homesteading, because they were not citizens, which changed with the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in 1868, when they were granted citizenship.

==War==

As the Northern Army began to seize property in its war with the South, Congress passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861]]. This law allowed the military to seize rebel property, including land and slaves. In fact, it reflected the rapidly growing reality of black refugee camps that sprung up around the Union Army. These glaring manifestations of the "Negro Problem" provoked hostility from much of the Union rank-and-file—and necessitated administration by officers.&lt;ref&gt;Engs, ''Freedom's First Generation'' (1979), p. 26. "The North, unprepared for war, was even more unprepared for the burden of caring for thousands of fleeing bondsmen. The only organization which could perform this monumental task was the Union army. But to most army men, freedmen were at best a nuisance. At worst, they were representatives of the despised race for whom Northern white men were being asked to kill or be killed."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grand Contraband Camp===
After secession, the Union maintained its control over [[Fort Monroe]] in [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] on the coast of Southern Virginia. Escaped slaves rushed to the area, hoping for protection from the Confederate Army. (Even more quickly, the town's white residents fled to Richmond.)&lt;ref&gt;Bonekemper, ''Negro Ownership of Real Property'' (1970), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] set a precedent for Union forces on May 24, 1861, when he refused to surrender escaped slaves to Confederates claiming ownership. Butler declared the slaves [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] of war and allowed them to remain with the Union Army.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''The Origin of Hampton Institute'' (1925), p. 133. "Nevertheless, shady though some of his tactics may have been in the opinion of some, Butler is to be rated as famous for the stand he took on that morning of the twenty-fourth of May when he declared that the escaped slave who stood before him should not be returned to his master but that he and all others who so came were to be regarded as contraband of war.2 From this time forward all escaped and abandoned slaves in the South were frequently known as 'contrabands.'"&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1861, there were 300 "contraband" slaves working for rations at Fort Monroe. By the end of July there were 900, and General Butler appointed [[Edward L. Pierce]] as Commissioner of Negro Affairs.&lt;ref name=Bonekemper170&gt;Bonekemper, ''Negro Ownership of Real Property'' (1970), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate raiders under General [[John B. Magruder]] burnt the nearby town of [[Hampton, Virginia]] on August 7, 1861, but the "contraband" blacks occupied its ruins.&lt;ref name=Bonekemper170 /&gt; They established a shantytown known as the [[Grand Contraband Camp]]. Many worked for the Army at a rate of $10.00/month, but these wages were not sufficient for them to make major improvements in housing. Conditions in The Camp grew worse, and Northern humanitarian groups sought to intervene on behalf of its 64,000 residents.&lt;ref name=Bonekemper171b&gt;Bonekemper, "Negro Ownership of Real Property" (1970), p. 171. "Nevertheless, the housing situation was so desperate that complaints emanated from the Reverend Lockwood, the A.M.A. and the just-organized National Freedmen's Relief Association and led to investigation by the American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission, appointment of Captain C. B. Wilder of Boston to protect the blacks' interests and the construction of large buildings in which the Negroes could live."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''The Origin of Hampton Institute'' (1925), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Captain C. B. Wilder was appointed to organize a response.&lt;ref name=Bonekemper171b /&gt; The perceived humanitarian crisis may have hastened Lincoln's plans for colonizing [[Île-à-Vache]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, "The Île a Vache Colonization Venture" (1959), p. 49. "The distress of the six thousand Negroes at Fort Monroe, Virginia, may have influenced Lincoln to proceed despite the Senator's misgivings. A report by Quakers in December, 1862, described the refugees quartered in small rooms, sometimes containing ten to twelve persons each, with insufficient fuel and clothing to keep warm throughout the winter month."&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan developed in September 1862 would have relocated refugees en masse to Massachusetts and other northern states.&lt;ref&gt;Voegeli, "A Rejected Alternative" (2003), p. 767.&lt;/ref&gt; This plan—initiated by [[John Adams Dix|John A. Dix]] and supported by Captain Wilder and Secretary of War Stanton—drew negative reactions from Republicans who wanted to avoid connecting northward black migration with the newly announced [[Emancipation Proclamation]].&lt;ref&gt;Voegeli, "A Rejected Alternative" (2003), p. 769.&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of competition by black workers, as well as generalized racial prejudice, made the prospect of black refugees unpalatable for Massachusetts politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Voegeli, "A Rejected Alternative" (2003), pp. 776–777.&lt;/ref&gt;

With support from orders from General [[Rufus Saxton]], General Butler and Captain Wilder pursued local resettlement operations, providing many of the blacks in Hampton with two acres of land and tools with which to work.&lt;ref name=Bonekemper171&gt;Bonekemper, "Negro Ownership of Real Property" (1970), pp. 171–172.&lt;/ref&gt; Others were assigned jobs as servants in the North.&lt;ref&gt;Engs, ''Freedom's First Generation'' (1979), pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Various smaller camps and colonies were formed, including the [[Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island]]. Hampton was well known as one of the War's first and biggest refugee camps, and served as a sort of model for other settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Engs, ''Freedom's First Generation'' (1979), pp. 3–4, 25. "During the Civil War, the groups which would shape the post-bellum life of black Hampton came together for the first time. Over that same period, the issues that would inform black and white approaches to freedom, in Hampton and in the South as a whole, crystalized. [...] In these unstable circumstances, Northern whites and Southern blacks had their first large-scale encounter of the war."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Union Army occupied the [[Sea Islands]] after the November 1861 [[Battle of Port Royal]], leaving the area's many cotton plantations to the black farmers who worked on them. The early liberation of the Sea Island blacks, and the relatively unusual absence of the former white masters, raised the issue of how the South might be organized after the fall of slavery. Lincoln, commented State Department official [[Adam Gurowski]], "is frightened with the success in South Carolina, as in his opinion this success will complicate the question of slavery."&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Gurowski]], ''[http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7135658M/Diary_... Diary: from March 4, 1861, to November 12, 1862.]''; Boston: Lee and Shepard, 1862, p. [https://archive.org/stream/diary01degu#page/120/mode/2up 121].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of federal occupation, troops were badly mistreating the island's residents, and had raided plantation supplies of food and clothing. One Union officer was caught preparing to secretly transport a group of blacks to Cuba, in order to sell them as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 20. "The rapid change in their status was not working to the advantage of many Sea Island Negroes, and their obvious hardship since the Federal invasion was embarrassing to the government. The army had made free use of plantation food stores, leaving many slave communities with little to eat. [...] Having no place to turn, they flocked to the neighborhood of the army camps. There, they were as often treated badly as offered employment and help. The New York ''Tribune's'' correspondent reported that one enterprising and unscrupulous officer was caught in the act of assembling a cargo of Negroes for transportation and sale in Cuba [...]".&lt;/ref&gt; Abuses by Union troops continued even after a stable regime had been established.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 240. "Violent examples of race hatred could be found wherever Northern troops came into contact with numbers of freedmen. Even at Port Royal, where Saxton's benevolent protectorate should have deterred overt demonstrations, there were appalling clashes. As late as February of 1863 unruly parties from several regiments, including the 9th New Jersey, the 100th New York, known as 'Les Enfants Perdus', and the 24th Massachusetts, went berserk and terrorized St. Helena Island. They killed and stole livestock, took money from the Negroes, and culminated their outrages in burning all the Negro cabins on the Daniel Jenkins plantations. They beat Negro men and attempted to rape the women, and when the superintendents intervened the soldiers threatened to shoot them."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gullah s carolina 1790.jpg|thumb|Gullah slaves had farmed the Sea Islands for several generations.]]
Treasury Secretary [[Salmon P. Chase]] had in December deployed Colonel William H. Reynolds to collect and sell whatever cotton could be confiscated from the Sea Island plantations.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Chase deployed Edward Pierce (after his brief period at Grand Contraband Camp) to assess the situation in [[Port Royal Island|Port Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, "The Promise of Land for the Freedmen" (1958), p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Pierce found a plantation under strict Army control, paying wages too low to enable economic independence; he also criticized the Army's policy of shipping cotton North to be ginned.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Pierce reported that the black workers were experts in cotton farming but required white managers "to enforce a paternal discipline". He recommended the establishment of a supervised black farming collective to prepare the workers for the responsibilities of citizenship—and to serve as a model for post-slavery labor relations in the South.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PierceLetter&gt;[[Edward L. Pierce]], ''The Negroes at Port Royal: Report of E. L. Pierce, Government Agent, to the Hon. Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury''; Boston: R. F. Walcutt, 1862; letter dated 3 February 1862. "The laborers themselves, no longer slaves of their former masters, or of the Government, but as yet in large numbers unprepared for the full privileges of citizens, are to be treated with sole reference to such preparation."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treasury Department sought to raise money and in many cases was already leasing occupied territories to Northern capitalists for private management. For Port Royal&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 32. "The government would undoubtedly take steps to put the cotton lands under cultivation, but Pierce was well aware that there was a plan alternative to his own that had very serious backing. While he was asking the government to gamble on the success of a novel agricultural experiment, Colonel Reynolds proposed leasing the plantations and the laborers to a private organization. Reynolds' plan had the merit of simplicity and much better prospects of immediate revenue to the government."&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Thomas had already prepared an arrangement of this type; but Pierce insisted that Port Royal offered the chance to "settle a great social question": namely, whether "when properly organized, and with proper motives set before them, [blacks] will as freemen be as industrious as any race of men are likely to be in this climate."&lt;ref name=PierceLetter /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Chase sent Pierce to see President Lincoln. As Pierce later described the encounter:

{{quotation|Mr. Lincoln, who was then chafing under a prospective bereavement, listened for a few moments, and then said, somewhat impatiently, that he did not think he ought to be troubled with such details, that there seemed to be an itching to get negroes into our lines; to which I replied that these negroes were within them by the invitation of no one, being domiciled there before we began occupation. The President then wrote and handed to me the following card :

&lt;blockquote&gt;I shall be obliged if the Secretary of the Treasury will in his discretion give Mr. Pierce such instructions in regard to Port Royal contrabands as may seem judicious. {{smallcaps|A. LINCOLN.}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

Pierce accepted this reluctant mandate, but feared that "some unhappy compromise" might compromise his plan to engineer black citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 34. "The young lawyer undoubtedly had hoped to hear some reassuring word from Lincoln about the future status of the Negroes at Port Royal. This was a point that had disturbed many prospective supporters of the educational work, for they feared that after being treated as freemen and trained to support themselves the Negroes might become the victims of 'some unhappy compromise.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Port Royal Experiment====

The collective was established and became known as the [[Port Royal Experiment]]: a possible model for black economic activity after slavery. The Experiment attracted support from Northerners like economist [[Edward Atkinson (activist)|Edward Atkinson]], who hoped to prove his theory that free labor would be more productive than slave labor.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; More traditional abolitionists like [[Maria Weston Chapman]] also praised Pierce's plan. Civic groups like the [[American Missionary Association]] provided enthusiastic assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; These sympathetic Northerners quickly recruited a boatload (53 chosen from a pool of applicants several times larger) of Ivy League and divinity school graduates who set off for Port Royal on March 3, 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The residents of Port Royal generally resented the military and civilian occupiers, who exhibited racist superiority in varying degrees of overtness.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 64–66, 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; Joy turned to sorrow when, on May 12 Union soldiers arrived to draft all able-bodied black men previously liberated on April 13, 1862, by General [[David Hunter]] who proclaimed slavery abolished in Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 144–146.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter kept his regiment even after Lincoln reversed this tri-state emancipation proclamation; but disbanded almost all of it when unable to draw payroll from the War Department.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Black farmers preferred to grow vegetables and catch fish, whereas the missionaries (and other whites on the islands) encouraged [[King Cotton|monoculture of cotton]] as a [[cash crop]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; In the thinking of the latter, civilization would be advanced by incorporating blacks into the consumer economy dominated by Northern manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 226–228. "It is this exclusive preoccupation with cotton that has given most support to the idea that the planter-missionaries were pure economic imperialists [...]. Their vision of the freed people as agricultural peasants devoted to a single-crop economy and educated to a taste for consumer goods supplied by Northern factories fulfils the classic pattern of tributary economics the world over. It is important to remember that at this early time there seemed nothing conspiratorial about this."&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, various conflicts arose among the missionaries, the Army, and the merchants whom Chase and Reynolds had invited to Port Royal in order to confiscate all that could be sold.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; On balance, however, the white sponsors of the Experiment had perceived positive results; businessman [[John Murray Forbes]] in May 1862 called it "a decided success", announcing that Blacks would indeed work in exchange for wages.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary of War [[Edwin M. Stanton]] appointed General [[Rufus Saxton]] as military governor of Port Royal in April 1862, and by December Saxton was agitating for permanent black control over the land. He won support from Stanton, Chase, Sumner, and President Lincoln, but met continuing resistance from a tax commission that wanted to sell the land.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, "The Promise of Land for the Freedmen" (1958), p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; Saxton also received approval to train a black militia, which formally became the [[1st South Carolina Volunteers (Union)|1st South Carolina Volunteers]] on January 1, 1863, when the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] legalized its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 191–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Landownership in the Sea Islands====
As elsewhere, black workers felt strongly that they had a claim to the lands they worked.

The [[Confiscation Act of 1862]] allowed the Treasury Department to sell many captured lands on the grounds of delinquent taxes. All told, the government now claimed 76,775 acres of Sea Island land.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Auditors arrived in Port Royal and began to assess the estates now occupied by blacks and missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 200–204.&lt;/ref&gt; The stakes were high: the Sea Island cotton harvest represented a lucrative commodity for Northern investors to control.&lt;ref name=Williamson56&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the whites involved in the project felt that black ownership of the land should be its final result. Saxton—along with journalists including ''Free South'' editor James G. Thompson, and missionaries including Methodist minister Mansfield French—lobbied hard for distribution of the land to black owners.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1863, Saxton unilaterally halted the Treasury Department's tax sale on the grounds of military necessity.&lt;ref name=Williamson56 /&gt;

The tax commissioners conducted the auction regardless, selling ten thousand acres of land.&lt;ref name="Oubre-p9"&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven plantations went to a consortium ("The Boston Concern") headed by Edward Philbrick, who sold the land in 1865 to black farmers.&lt;ref name=Williamson56 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 212–213, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; One black farming collective outbid the outside investors, paying an average of $7.00 per acre for the 470 plantation on which they already lived and worked.&lt;ref name="Oubre-p9" /&gt; Overall, the majority of the land was sold to Northern investors and remained under their control.&lt;ref name=Williamson56 /&gt;

In September 1863, Lincoln announced a plan to auction 60,000 acres of South Carolina land in lots of 320 acres—setting aside 16,000 acres of the land for "heads of families of the African race", who could obtain 20-acre lots sold at $1.25/acre.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Tax Commissioner [[William Brisbane (commissioner)|William Brisbane]] envisioned racial integration on the islands, with large plantation owners employing landless blacks.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; But Saxton and French considered the 16,000-acre reserve to be inadequate, and instructed black families to stake claims and build houses on all 60,000 acres of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 274–275.&lt;/ref&gt; French traveled to Washington in December 1863 to lobby for legal confirmation of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; At French's urging, Chase and Lincoln authorized Sea Island families (and solitary wives of soldiers in the Union Army) to claim 40-acre plots. Other individuals over the age of 21 would be allowed to claim 20 acres. These plots would be purchased at $1.25 per acre, with 40% paid upfront and 60% paid later. With a requirement of six months' prior residency, the order functionally restricted settlement to blacks, missionaries, and others who were already involved in the Experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims to land under the new plan began to arrive immediately, but Commissioner Brisbane ignored them, hoping for another reversal of the decision in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Chase did indeed reverse his position in February, restoring the plan for a tax sale.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale took place in late February, with land selling for an average price of more than $11/acre.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale provoked outcry from freedpeople who had already claimed land according to Chase's December order.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 295. "There were ample signs of impending trouble. A group of superintendents returning to St. Helena from the sale of February 26 were met near Land's End by a crowd of freed people, who surrounded them clamoring for information and 'complaining that their land—that they had pre-empted—had been sold away from them, and declaring that they wouldn't work for the purchaser.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Negroes of Savannah"====

Major General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s "[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]" brought a massive regiment of the Union Army to the Georgia coast in December 1864. Accompanying the Army were an estimated ten thousand black refugees, former slaves. This group was already suffering from starvation and disease.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, "Uncle Billy" (1995), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drago, "How Sherman's March Through Georgia Affected the Slaves" (1973), p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; Many former slaves had become disillusioned by the Union Army, having suffered pillaging, rape, and other abuses.&lt;ref&gt;Drago, ''How Sherman's March Through Georgia Affected the Slaves'' (1973), pp. 369–371.&lt;/ref&gt; They arrived in Savannah "after long marches and severe privations, ''weary, famished, sick, and almost naked''.&lt;ref&gt;Drago, "How Sherman's March Through Georgia Affected the Slaves" (1973), p. 372; quoting the Augusta ''Daily Constitutionalist'', 29 January 1865.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 19, Sherman dispatched many of these slaves to [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina|Hilton Head]], an island already serving as refugee camp. Saxton reported on December 22 "Every cabin and house on these islands is filled to overflowing—I have some 15,000." 700 more arrived on Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, "Uncle Billy" (1995), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 1865, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton arrived in Savannah with Quartermaster General [[Montgomery C. Meigs (1816–1892)|Montgomery C. Meigs]] and other officials. This group met with Generals Sherman and Saxton to discuss the refugee crisis. They decided, in turn, to consult leaders from the local Black community and ask them: "What do you want for your own people?" A meeting was duly arranged.&lt;ref&gt;James, "Sherman at Savannah" (1954), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikisource|Negroes of Savannah}}

At 8:00 PM on January 12, 1865, Sherman met with a group of twenty people, many of whom had been slaves for most of their lives. The blacks of Savannah had seized the opportunity of emancipation to strengthen their community's institutions, and they had strong political feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, "Uncle Billy" (1995), pp. 99–102.&lt;/ref&gt; They selected one spokesperson: Garrison Frazier, the 67-year-old former pastor of Third African Baptist. In the late 1850s, he had for $1,000 bought freedom for himself and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, "Uncle Billy" (1995), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Frazier had consulted with the refugees as well as the other representatives. He told Sherman: "The way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor." Frazier suggested that young men would serve the government in fighting the Rebels, and that therefore "the women and children and old men" would have to work this land. Almost all of those present agreed to request land grants for autonomous black communities, on the grounds that racial hatred would prevent economic advancement for blacks in mixed areas.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, "The Promise of Land for the Freedmen" (1958), p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An account of this meeting was published on 13 February 1865 in the ''New York Daily Tribune'' as "Negroes of Savannah". A copy of the ''Daily Tribune'' article is held by the US National Archives and can be found [http://www.nps.gov/fopu/forteachers/upload/Resources.pdf#page=16 here] transcribed by the National Park Service. According to Adjutant General [[Edward D. Townsend]], the formal exchange represents a verbatim account of the meeting: "I do hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and faithful report of the questions and answers made by the colored ministers and church members of Savannah in my presence and hearing, at the chambers of Major-Gen. Sherman, on the evening of Thursday, Jan 12, 1865. The questions of Gen. Sherman and the Secretary of War were reduced to writing and read to the persons present. The answers were made by the Rev. Garrison Frazier, who was selected by the other ministers and church members to answer for them. The answers were written down in his exact words, and read over to the others, who one by one expressed his concurrence or dissent as above set forth."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15====
{{wikisource|Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15}}

[[Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15]], issued on January 16, 1865, instructed officers to settle these refugees on the Sea Islands and inland: 400,000 total acres divided into 40-acre plots.&lt;ref name=Gates&gt;[[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], "[http://www.theroot.com/the-truth-behind-40-acres-and-a-mule-1790894780 The Truth Behind '40 Acres and a Mule']", ''The Root'', 7 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/sfo15.htm Order by the Commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi].&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[mule]]s (beasts of burden used for plowing) were not mentioned,&lt;ref name=Gates /&gt; some of its beneficiaries did receive them from the army.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reconstruction/40acres/ps_so15.html "Reconstruction ... Forty Acres and a Mule"] at ''American Experience'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; Such plots were colloquially known as "[[Blackacre]]s", which may have a basis for their origin in contract law.{{clarify|date=January 2013}}{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Sherman's orders specifically allocated "the islands from [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], south, the abandoned rice fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the [[St. Johns River]], [[Florida]]." The order specifically prohibits whites from settling in this area. Saxton, who, with Stanton, helped to craft the document, was promoted to Major General and charged with oversight of the new settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Buescher, John. "[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24170 Forty Acres and a Mule]." [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Retrieved 13 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 3, Saxton addressed a large freedpeople's meeting at Second African Baptist, announcing the order and outlining preparations for new settlement.&lt;ref&gt;James, "Sherman at Savannah" (1954), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, "Uncle Billy" (1995), pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; By June 1865, about 40,000 freedpeople were settled on {{Convert|435000|acre|ha|sigfig=2}} in the Sea Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, "Uncle Billy" (1995), pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Special Field Orders were issued by Sherman, not the federal government with regards to all former slaves, and he issued similar ones "throughout the campaign to assure the harmony of action in the area of operations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA252324&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf "Harmony of Action"&amp;nbsp;– Sherman as an army group commander].&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman himself later said that these settlements were never intended to last. However, this was never the understanding of the settlers—nor of General Saxton, who said he asked Sherman to cancel the order unless it was meant to be permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, "The Promise of Land for the Freedmen" (1958), p. 429. "But the freedmen quite naturally anticipated permanent possession; and Saxton later testified that he had begged not to be charged with carrying out Sherman's order if the freedmen's expectations were once again to be broken, and that he had received assurances from Secretary Stanton that the Negroes would retain possession of the land."&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the areas of land settled were quite variable. James Chaplin Beecher observed that the "so called 40 acre tract[s] vary in size from eight acres to (450) four hundred and fifty."&lt;ref&gt;Saville, ''The Work of Reconstruction'' (1994), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas were settled by groups: [[Skidaway Island, Georgia|Skidaway Island]] was colonized by a group of over 1000 people, including Reverend [[Ulysses L. Houston]].&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, "Uncle Billy" (1995), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Significance====

The Sea Islands project reflected a policy of "40 acres and a mule" as the basis for post-slavery economics. Especially in 1865, the precedent it set was highly visible to newly free blacks seeking land of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), pp.&amp;nbsp;54–55.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'Forty acres and a mule', that delightful bit of myopic mythology so often ascribed to the newly freed in the Reconstruction period, at least in South Carolina during the spring and summer of 1865, represented far more than the chimerical rantings of the ignorant darkies, irresponsible soldiers", and radical politicians. On the contrary, it symbolized precisely the policy which the government had already given and was giving mass application in the Sea Islands. Hardly had the troops landed, in November, 1861, before liberal Northerners arrived to begin a series of ambitious experiment in the reconstruction of Southern society. One of these experiments included the redistribution of large landed estates to the Negroes. By the Spring of 1865, this program was well underway, and after August any well-informed intelligent observer in South Carolina would have concluded, as did the Negroes, that some considerable degree of permanent land division was highly probable.&lt;/ref&gt; Freedpeople from across the region flocked to the area in search of land.&lt;ref name=Oubre47&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), pp. 47–48. "By summer of 1865, word of Sherman's Special Field Order, No. 15 had spread throughout the states covered by the order as well as to neighboring states. So great was the desire for land that blacks poured into the reservation in search of their forty-acre plots."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Webster94 /&gt; The result was refugee camps afflicted by disease and short on supplies.&lt;ref name=Oubre47 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Especially after Sherman's Orders, the coastal settlements generated enthusiasm for a new society that would supplant the slave system. Reported one journalist in April 1865: "It was the Plymouth colony repeating itself. They agreed if any others came to join them, they should have equal privileges. So blooms the Mayflower on the South Atlantic Coast."&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wage labor system===
Beginning in occupied Louisiana under General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]], the military developed a wage-labor system for cultivating large areas of land. This system—which took effect with Lincoln and Stanton's blessing soon after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] legitimized contracts with the freedpeople—offered ironclad one-year contracts to freedpeople. The contract promised $10/month as well as provisions and medical care. The system was soon also adopted by General [[Lorenzo Thomas]] in Mississippi.&lt;ref name=Belz46&gt;Belz, ''A New Birth of Freedom'' (2000), pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes land came under the control of Treasury officials. Jurisdictional disputes erupted between the Treasury Department and the military.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, "The Promise of Land for the Freedmen" (1958), p. 425. "Disposition of lands and indirectly of Negro labor through Treasury agents to northern lessees brought forth even greater condemnation than direct military supervision. [...] The investigations of James E. Yeatman for the Western Sanitary Commission late in 1863 revealed shocking exploitation and abuse of freedmen working the leased plantations. Attempts during 1864 to remedy those abuses resulted in confusion and conflict of authority between army officers and Treasury agents."&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of Treasury Department profiteering by General [[John Eaton (general)|John Eaton]] and journalists who witnessed the new form of plantation labor influenced public opinion in the North and pressured Congress to support direct control of land by freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, "The Promise of Land for the Freedmen" (1958), pp. 425–426. "There can be no doubt that these varied wartime experiences, together with the criticism and publicity they evoked, affected the Freedmen's Bureau legislation. They make clear what the framers of its final version were attempting to avoid, namely, government plantation operation, exploitation of Negro labor by northern speculators, abuse and rigorous control of freedmen by southern planters whether in violation of military directives or in collusion with military personnel, even the minute paternalistic regulations drawn to safeguard the freedmen that might lead to a permanent 'pupilage'."&lt;/ref&gt; The Treasury Department, particularly as Secretary Chase prepared to seek the [[1864 Republican National Convention|Republican nomination in 1864]], accused the military of treating the freedpeople inhumanely.&lt;ref name=Belz46 /&gt; Lincoln decided in favor of military rather than Treasury jurisdiction, and the wage labor system became more deeply established.&lt;ref&gt;Belz, ''A New Birth of Freedom'' (2000), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Abolitionist critics of the policy called it no better than [[serf]]dom.&lt;ref&gt;Belz, ''A New Birth of Freedom'' (2000), pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Davis Bend===
One of the largest black landownership projects took place at [[Davis Bend, Mississippi]], the 11,000-acre site of plantations owned by [[Joseph Emory Davis|Joseph Davis]] and his famous younger brother [[Jefferson Davis|Jefferson]], president of the Confederacy. Influenced by some aspects of [[Robert Owen]]'s [[socialism]], Joseph Davis had established the experimental 4000-acre [[Hurricane Plantation]] in 1827 at Davis Bend.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, ''Pursuit of a Dream'' (1981), pp. 3–9. "The reformer was criticized not so much for his practical failures as for his open rejection of orthodox religion and the institution of marriage. Although Davis did not agree with these radical ideas, he continued to admire the Scottish utopian for his innovative theories. However, the new planter proposed to adopt only the elements of Owen's philosophy that would promote his goal of an efficient, prosperous plantation community."&lt;/ref&gt; Davis allowed several hundred slaves to eat nutritious food, live in well-built cottages, receive medical care, and resolve their disputes in a weekly "Hall of Justice" court. His motto was: "The less people are governed, the more submissive they will be to control."&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, ''Pursuit of a Dream'' (1981), pp. 11–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Davis relied heavily on the managerial skills of [[Ben Montgomery]], a well-educated slave who conducted much of the plantation's business.

The [[Battle of Shiloh]] began a period of turmoil (1862–1863), at Davis Bend, although its black residents continued farming. The plantation was occupied by two companies of black Union troops in December 1863. Under the command of Colonel Samuel Thomas, these soldiers began to fortify the area. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] had expressed a desire to make of the Davis plantations "a negro paradise." Thomas began to lease the land to black tenants for the 1864 crop season.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, ''Pursuit of a Dream'' (1981), pp. 38– 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''Reconstruction'' (2011), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Black refugees who had gathered in Vicksburg moved ''en masse'' to Davis Bend under the auspices of the Freedman's Department (an agency created by the military prior to Congressional authorization of the "Freedmen's Bureau", discussed below).&lt;ref name="Oubre-p17"&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis Bend was caught in the middle of the turf war between the military and the Treasury Department. In February 1864, the Treasury re-confiscated 2000 acres of Davis Bend, restoring them to white owners who had sworn loyalty oaths.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, ''Pursuit of a Dream'' (1981), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; It also leased 1,200 acres to Northern investors.&lt;ref name=Hermann50&gt;Hermann, ''Pursuit of a Dream'' (1981), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Thomas resisted instructions to prevent the free blacks from farming, General Eaton ordered him to comply. Eaton also ordered Thomas to confiscate farming equipment held by blacks, on the grounds that—because Mississippi law banned slaves from owning property—they must have stolen such possessions.&lt;ref name=Hermann50 /&gt; The Treasury Department sought to charge the plantation workers a fee for using the cotton gin.&lt;ref name="Oubre-p17" /&gt; The residents of Davis Bend objected strenuously to these measures. In a petition signed by 56 farmers (including Montgomery) and published in the New Orleans ''Tribune'':&lt;ref&gt;29 July 1865; quoted in Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the commencement of our present year, this plantation was, in compliance with an order of our Post Commander, deprived of horses, mules, oxen and farming utensils of every description, very much of which had been captured and brought into Union lines by the undersigned; in consequence of which deprivations, we were, of course, reduced to the necessity of buying everything necessary for farming, and having thus far succeeded in performing by far the most expensive and laborious part of our work, we are prepared to accomplish the ginning, pressing, weighing, marking, consigning, etc., in a business-like order if allowed to do so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Freedmen's Bureau==
From 1863–1865, Congress debated what policies it might adopt to address the social issues that would confront the South after the war. The Freedmen's Aid Society pushed for a "Bureau of Emancipation" to assist in the economic transition away from slavery. It used [[Port Royal]] as evidence that blacks could live and work on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), pp. 336–338.&lt;/ref&gt; Land reform was often discussed, though some objected that too much capital would be required to ensure the success of black farmers.&lt;ref name=WEBDB222 /&gt; On January 31, 1865, the House of Representatives approved the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]], which outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude except in the case of punishment.

Congress continued to debate the economic and social status of the free population, with land reform identified as critical to realizing black freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, "The Promise of Land for the Freedmen" (1958), p. 413. "Only a few weeks earlier the members of Congress by their approval of the Thirteenth Amendment had agreed that henceforth the Negro was to be a free man, never again a slave; now they took action to put him on the road to economic independence of the type traditional to free men in the 19th-century agrarian Republic, namely, ownership of the land that he tilled."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''Rehearsal for Reconstruction'' (1964), p. 339. "With the approval of the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress had put its blessing on the free status of Negro Americans; the land provision of the Bureau Act was the natural response of a nation of small farmers to set the black man on the road to economic freedom. The purpose of the Bureau itself was to assure a reasonable and temporary protection for the Negro as he passed into his new condition."&lt;/ref&gt; A bill drafted in [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]] to provide limited land tenure for one year while authorizing military supervision of freedmen was rejected in the Senate by abolitionists who thought it did not do justice to the freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, "The Promise of Land for the Freedmen" (1958), p. 417. "The chief spokesmen for the Republican opposition were James W. Grimes of Iowa, Henry S. Lane of Indiana, and John P. Hale of New Hampshire, all antislavery men who feared that the supervision provided for the freedmen might lead to their abuse. As the New York ''Herald'' reported with some satisfaction, the Freedmen's Bureau bill 'was killed by its friends,' a display of independence towards Sumner which the paper found 'quite refreshing.'"&lt;/ref&gt; A six-person committee quickly wrote "an entirely new bill" which substantially increased its promise to the freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, "The Promise of Land for the Freedmen" (1958), p. 418. Cox quotes "an entirely new bill" from the ''Congressional Globe'', 3 March 1865, p. [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=069/llcg069.db&amp;recNum=637 1042].&lt;/ref&gt;

This stronger version of the bill passed both houses on March 3, 1865. With this bill, Congress [[Freedmen's Bureau bills|established]] the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands]] under the War Department. The Bureau had authority to provide supplies for refugees—and an unfunded mandate to redistribute land, in parcels of up to 40 acres:&lt;ref name=Oubre21&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2282&amp;chapter=216250&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 Freedmen's Bureau Bill]" (approved March 3, 1865) as reproduced in ''The American Nation: Primary Sources'', ed. Bruce Frohnen; Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sec. 4. ''And be it further enacted,'' That the commissioner, under the direction of the President, shall have authority to set apart, for the use of loyal refugees and freedmen, such tracts of land within the insurrectionary states as shall have been abandoned, or to which the United States shall have acquired title by confiscation or sale, or otherwise, and to every male citizen, whether refugee or freedman, as aforesaid, there shall be assigned not more than forty acres of such land, and the person to whom it was so assigned shall be protected in the use and enjoyment of the land for the term of three years at an annual rent not exceeding six per centum upon the value of such land, as it was appraised by the state authorities in the year eighteen hundred and sixty, for the purpose of taxation, and in case no such appraisal can be found, then the rental shall be based upon the estimated value of the land in said year, to be ascertained in such manner as the commissioner may by regulation prescribe. At the end of said term, or at any time during said term, the occupants of any parcels so assigned may purchase the land and receive such title thereto as the United States can convey, upon paying therefor the value of the land, as ascertained and fixed for the purpose of determining the annual rent aforesaid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The bill thus established a system in which Southern blacks could lease abandoned and confiscated land, with yearly rent at 6% (or less) of the land's value (assessed for tax purposes in 1860). After three years, they would have the option to buy this land at full price. The Bureau in charge, which became known as the Freedmen's Bureau, was placed under the continuing supervision of the military because Congress anticipated the need to defend black settlements from White Southerners.&lt;ref name=Oubre21 /&gt; The bill implicitly rejected plans by Lincoln and others to colonize blacks abroad, or even in segregated regions of the United States—its mandate would have institutionalized black landownership of the same land that had formerly relied on their unpaid labor.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, "The Promise of Land for the Freedmen" (1958), p. 413. "Implicit in the decision was the acceptance of the fact that the freedmen would not be colonized abroad, as Lincoln and many others less concerned with the Negro's welfare had wished, nor even colonized in designated areas within the home boundaries, but that he should remain a basic economic and social element in his southern homeland."&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Andrew Johnson]] became president after [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's assassination]], he took aggressive steps to restore the Union. On May 29, 1865, Johnson issued an amnesty proclamation to ordinary Southern citizens who swore loyalty oaths, promising not only political immunity but also return of confiscated property. (Johnson's proclamation excluded Confederate politicians, military officers, and landowners with property worth more than $20,000.) General [[Oliver O. Howard|O. O. Howard]], chief of the Freedmen's Bureau, requested an interpretation from Attorney General [[James Speed]] regarding how this proclamation would affect the Freedmen's Bureau mandate. Speed replied on June 22, 1865 that the Bureau Commissioner:&lt;ref name=Oubre31&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McFeely, ''Yankee Stepfather'' (1994), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Johnson, Amnesty Proclamation, May 29, 1865. [https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/30/news/president-johnson-s-amnesty-proclamation-restoration-rights-property-except.html Text].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Speed, "Opinion on Duty of the Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau", June 22, 1865. [http://www.drbronsontours.com/bronsonattorneygeneraljamesspeedopinionondutyofcommissionerofthefreedmensbureaujune221865.html Text].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... has ''authority'', under the direction of the President, to set apart for the use of loyal refugees and freedmen the lands in question; and he is ''required'' to assign to every male of that class of persons, not more than forty acres of such lands.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Circular #13===

Howard acted quickly based on the authorization from Speed, ordering an inventory of lands available for redistribution and resisting white Southerners' attempts to reclaim property.&lt;ref&gt;McFeely, ''Yankee Stepfather'' (1994), pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak in 1865, the Freedmen's Bureau controlled 800,000–900,000 acres of plantation lands previously belonging to slave owners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dalton Conley]], "[https://files.nyu.edu/dc66/public/pdf/contexts_reparations.pdf Forty Acres and a Mule: What if America Pays Reparations?]", ''Contexts'' 1(3), Fall 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This area represented 0.2% of land in the South; ultimately the Johnson proclamation required the Bureau to re-allocate most of it to its former owners.&lt;ref name="Oubre31" /&gt;

On July 28, 1865, Howard issued "Circular no. 13", a directive within the Freedmen's Bureau to issue land to refugees and freedmen. Circular no. 13 explicitly instructed Bureau agents to prioritize the Congressional mandate for land distribution over Johnson's amnesty declaration. Its final section clarified: "The pardon of the President will not be understood to extend to the surrender of abandoned or confiscated property which by law has been 'set apart for Refugees and Freedmen'".&lt;ref&gt;McFeely, ''Yankee Stepfather'' (1994), pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. O. Howard, "Circular no. 13", July 28, 1865; [[National Archives and Records Administration]], Record Group 105, Entry 24, No. 139 Asst Adjutant General Circulars 1865-1869, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, pp. 14-15; transcribed from original by John Soos in August, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; With Circular #13, land redistribution was an official policy for the entire South, and understood as such by army officers.&lt;ref&gt;McFeely, ''Yankee Stepfather'' (1994), p. 105. "From July 28, 1865, until the circular order was rescinded in September, region-wide redistribution of abandoned and confiscated lands in the South was the stated policy of an agency of the United States government. It was so understood (if not put into practice) by army officers in the South. Had it been implemented, every freedman would not have gotten forty acres of land, but 20,000 Negro families in all sections of the South would have gotten a start on their own farms."&lt;/ref&gt;

After issuing Circular 13, however, Howard, seemingly unaware of how significant and controversial his instructions might prove, left Washington for a vacation in Maine.&lt;ref&gt;McFeely, ''Yankee Stepfather'' (1994), pp. 108–109. "It does not seem altogether improbable that Howard was not fully aware of the implications of his Circular. As happened more than once during Reconstruction, the compelling needs of the Negroes drew more radical moves from conservative hands. That the Commissioner was asking the President of the United States to acquiesce to a revolutionary principle of dividing large holdings."&lt;/ref&gt; President Johnson and others began to counteract the Circular almost immediately. After Johnson ordered the Bureau to restore the estate of a complaining Tennessee plantation owner, General Joseph S. Fullerton suggested to at least one subordinate that Circular #13 "will not be observed for the present".&lt;ref&gt;Hahn et al., ''Land and Labor, 1865'' (2008), p. 401. "Complaints from aggrieved landowners about the refusal of Freedmen's Bureau officials to relinquish abandoned property soon reached President Johnson, who effectively nullified not only Howard's circular but also the intentions of Congress as expressed in the land provisions of the law creating the bureau. On August 16, intervening on behalf of a pardoned Confederate from his home state of Tennessee, Johnson ordered the bureau to restore the man's estate without delay. 'The same action will be had in all similar cases', he added."&lt;/ref&gt;

When Howard returned to Washington, Johnson ordered him to write a new Circular that would respect his policy of land restoration. Johnson rejected Howard's draft and wrote his own version, which he issued on September 12 as Circular #15—including Howard's name.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn et al., ''Land and Labor, 1865'' (2008), pp. 402–403; document transcribed, pp. 431–432.&lt;/ref&gt; Circular #15 established strict criteria for designating a property as "officially confiscated" and had the effect in many places of ending land redistribution completely.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 38. "The new circular made the possession of land so uncertain that many bureau agents discontinued their policy of assigning land to the freedmen."&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially during the six-week period between Circular #13 and Circular #15, '40 acres and a mule' (along with other supplies necessary for farming) represented a common promise of Freedmen's Bureau agents. [[Clinton B. Fisk]], Assistant Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau for Kentucky and Tennessee, had announced at a black political assembly: "They must not only have freedom but homes of their own, thirty or forty acres, with mules, cottages, and schoolhouses etc."

A Bureau administrator in Virginia proposed leasing to each family a 40-acre plot of land, a pair of mules, harnesses, a cart, tools, seeds, and food supplies. The family would pay for these supplies after growing crops and selling them.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Codes===
{{Main|Black Codes (United States)}}
Bureau agents encountered legal problems in allocating land to freedpeople as a result of the "Black Codes" passed by Southern legislatures in late 1865 and 1866. Some of the new laws prevented black people from owning or leasing land. The Freedmen's Bureau generally treated the black Codes as invalid, based on federal legislation. However, the Bureau was not always able to enforce its interpretation after the Union Army had substantially demobilized.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonization and homesteading==
During and after the war, politicians, generals and others envisioned a variety of colonization plans that would have provided real estate to black families. Although the [[American Colonization Society]] had been colonizing more people in Liberia and receiving more donations (almost one million dollars in the 1850s), it did not have the means to respond to mass emancipation.&lt;ref name=Dyer55&gt;Dyer, "The Persistence of the Idea of Negro Colonization" (1943), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign colonization plans===
Lincoln had long [[Abraham Lincoln and slavery#Colonization|supported colonization]] as a plausible solution to the problem of slavery, and pursued colonization plans throughout his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Lockett, "Abraham Lincoln and Colonization" (1991), p. 430. "Lincoln held the strong belief that colonization would accomplish a twofold objection: rid the nation of racial strife by ridding the nation of its freedmen, which in effect would render America a white man's country (Richardson, 1907, p. 153)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Magness4 /&gt; In 1862, Congress approved $600,000 to fund Lincoln's plan for colonizing blacks "in a climate congenial to them", and granted Lincoln broad executive powers to orchestrate colonization.&lt;ref name=Magness4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lockett, "Abraham Lincoln and Colonization" (1991), pp. 431–432. "This act made Lincoln the sole authority on all plans involving government-financed colonization, as well as on how the money would be spent. It pushed Lincoln far ahead in the field of those who had dedicated themselves to the colonization of the Negro, reaching back to Thomas Jefferson."&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln immediately created an Emigration Office within the Department of the Interior and instructed the State Department to acquire suitable land.&lt;ref name=Magness4&gt;Magness &amp; Page, ''Colonization after Emancipation'' (2011), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Linconia|major plan]] considered would have sent employed free blacks as coal miners in [[Chiriquí Province]], Panama (then part of [[Gran Colombia]]). Volunteers were promised 40 acres of land and a job in the mines; Senator [[Samuel C. Pomeroy]], whom Lincoln had appointed to oversee the plan, had also purchased mules, yokes, tools, wagons, seeds, and other supplies to support a potential colony. Pomeroy accepted 500 of the 13,700 people who applied for the job. However, the plan was canceled by the end of the year—due perhaps to Latin American and British opposition, or to a discovery that Chiriquí's coal was of poor quality.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lockett, "Abraham Lincoln and Colonization" (1991), p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page, "Lincoln and Chiriquí Colonization Revisited" (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Liberia, an independent black nation, Haiti was also considered a good place to colonize freedpeople from the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Lockett, "Abraham Lincoln and Colonization" (1991), p. 432. "Because Haiti and Liberia were black independent republics with climatic and topographical features favorable for Black people, Lincoln considered the two countries prime sites for establishing colonies ([[Nicolay &amp; Hay]], 1890, Vol. 6, p. 168)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page, "Lincoln and Chiriquí Colonization Revisited" (2011), p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Chiriquí plan was hitting its stride in 1862, Lincoln was developing another plan to colonize the small island of [[Île à Vache]] near Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;Page, "Lincoln and Chiriquí Colonization Revisited" (2011), p. 313. "In fact, the president had those two projects under consideration concurrently during late 1862 and early 1863 – and even the 'second wave' of imperial schemes should be understood more in reference to their longer life than to the date of their initiation. Personally, Lincoln was keen to experiment with several options and to see what worked best."&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln struck a deal with businessman Bernard Kock, who had obtained rights to lease the island for cultivation and wood-cutting.&lt;ref&gt;Lockett, "Abraham Lincoln and Colonization" (1991), p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; 453 Blacks, mostly young men from the [[Tidewater region]] around occupied [[Hampton, Virginia]], volunteered to colonize the island.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, "The Île a Vache Colonization Venture" (1959), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, 1863, they left Fort Monroe in the "Ocean Ranger".&lt;ref name=Lockett439&gt;Lockett, "Abraham Lincoln and Colonization" (1991), pp. 438–439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, "The Persistence of the Idea of Negro Colonization" (1943), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Kock confiscated all of the money possessed by the colonists and did not pay their wages.&lt;ref name=Lockett439 /&gt; Initial reports suggested dire conditions, though these were later disputed. A number of colonists died in the first year.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, "The Île a Vache Colonization Venture" (1959), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; 292 survivors from the original group remained on the island and 73 had moved to [[Aux Cayes]]; most were restored to the U.S. by a mission of the Navy in February 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Lockett, "Abraham Lincoln and Colonization" (1991), p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress rescinded Lincoln's colonization authority in July 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, "The Île a Vache Colonization Venture" (1959), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln continued to pursue colonization plans, particularly in the [[British West Indies]], but none came to fruition. The American Colonization Society settled a few hundred people in Liberia during the war, and several thousand more in the five years following.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic colonization plans===
Confederate general [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] had proposed in 1865 before the end of the war to hire black soldiers and freedmen in constructing a railroad for the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad Company, paying them with $1/day and land along the railway line.&lt;ref name=Oubre73&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), pp. 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal later gained the endorsements of Sherman, Howard, Johnson, and Arkansas Governor [[Isaac Murphy]].&lt;ref name=Hahn410&gt;Hahn et al., ''Land and Labor, 1865'' (2008), p. 402; document transcribed, pp. 410–411.&lt;/ref&gt; Howard transported several hundred freedmen from Alabama to Arkansas for work on the line. He appointed [[Edward Ord]] to supervise the project and protect the freedmen from Forrest.&lt;ref name=Oubre73 /&gt;

===Southern Homesteading Act===
{{main|Southern Homestead Act of 1866}}
As it became clear that the pool of land available for blacks was rapidly shrinking, the Union discussed various proposals for how blacks might resettle and eventually own their own land. In Virginia, the mass of landless blacks represented a growing crisis—soon to be exacerbated by the return of 10,000 black soldiers from Texas. Concerned about a possible insurrection, Colonel Orlando Brown (head of the Freedmen's Bureau in Virginia) proposed relocating Virginia's blacks to Texas or Florida. Brown proposed that the federal government reserve 500,000 acres in Florida for colonization by the soldiers and 50,000 other free blacks from Virginia. Howard took Brown's proposal to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), pp. 81–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hahn et al., ''Land and Labor, 1865'' (2008), p. 402; document transcribed, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1865, Congress began to debate the "Second Freedmen's Bureau bill", which would have opened three million acres of unoccupied public land in Florida, Mississippi, and Arkansas for homesteading.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2282&amp;chapter=216251&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill]" (introduced December 4, 1865) as reproduced in ''The American Nation: Primary Sources'', ed. Bruce Frohnen; Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (An amendment to allow black homesteading on public lands in the North was defeated.) Congress passed the bill in February 1866 but could not override Johnson's veto.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2282&amp;chapter=216252&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 Veto of the Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill]" (introduced December 4, 1865) as reproduced in ''The American Nation: Primary Sources'', ed. Bruce Frohnen; Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (Congress passed a more limited "Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill" in July 1866, and did override Johnson's veto.)

Howard continued to push for Congress to appropriate land for allocation to freedmen. With support from [[Thaddeus Stevens]] and [[William Fessenden]], Congress began to debate a new bill for black settlement of public lands in the South. The result was the [[Southern Homestead Act]], which opened 46,398,544.87 acres of land in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas to homesteading; initially 80-acre parcels (half-quarter section) until June 1868, and thereafter 160-acre parcels (quarter section). Johnson signed this bill and it went into effect on June 21, 1866. Until January 1, 1867, the bill specified, only free blacks and loyal whites would be allowed access to these lands.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard, concerned about competition with Confederates that would begin in 1867, ordered Bureau agents to inform free blacks about the Homesteading Act.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Local commissioners did not disseminate the information widely,&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; and many freedpeople were unwilling to venture into unknown territory, with insufficient supplies, based only on the promise of land after five years.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who did attempt homesteading encountered unreliable bureaucracy that often did not comply with federal law. They also faced extremely harsh conditions, usually on low quality land that had been rejected by white settlers in years past. Nevertheless, free blacks entered about 6,500 claims to homesteads; about 1000 of these eventually resulted in property certificates.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
Southern land owners regained control over almost all of the land they had claimed before the war. The national dialogue about land ownership as a key to success for freedpeople gave way (in the sphere of white politics and media) to the implementation of a plantation wage system. Under pressure from Johnson and other pro-capital politicians in the North, and from almost all of white society in the South, the Freedmen's Bureau was transformed from a protector of land rights to an enforcer of wage labor.&lt;ref&gt;Engs, ''Freedom's First Generation'' (1979), p. 122. "Throughout the South, freedmen were required to make labor contracts with their former owners, and local Bureau agents were charged to enforce the terms of these agreements. Black refugees from rural counties were returned to their home plantations despite proof that they would be subject to mistreatment. Rather than fostering black independence, the Bureau became an agency to assist Southern whites in perpetuating black subordination. Agents who resisted these perversions of the Bureau's purpose, like Wilder, or Saxton in South Carolina, were dismissed and replaced by officers more amenable to the president and his southern allies."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hopes and expectations===
Free blacks in the South widely believed that all land would be redistributed to those who had worked on it. They also felt strongly that they had a right to own this land.&lt;ref name=Foner277&gt;Foner, "Languages of Change" (1988), p. 277. "Unlike freedmen in other countries, however, American blacks emerged from slavery convinced both that they had a ''right'' to a portion of their former owner's land, and that the national government had committed itself to land distribution."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hahn et al., ''Land and Labor, 1865'' (2008), p. 397. "However long they had been in residence and whatever the legal status of the property they occupied, freedpeople living on federally controlled land considered themselves entitled to security in its possession and use. Their unrequited toil in slavery and their support of the Union during the war gave them, they believed, a claim superior to that of absent, disloyal owners."&lt;/ref&gt; Many expected this event to occur by Christmas 1865 or New Year's 1866.&lt;ref name=Wilson55&gt;Wilson, ''Black Codes'' (1965), p. 55. "Finally, it must be observed that a great deal of the freedmen's idleness stemmed from their almost universal belief that they would receive a gift of land from the federal government at Christmas or New Year's."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hahn et al., ''Land and Labor, 1865'' (2008), p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WEBDB603&gt;Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction'', p. [https://archive.org/stream/blackreconstruc00dubo#page/603/mode/2up 603].&lt;/ref&gt; Although the freedpeople formed this belief in response to the policies of the Freedmen's Bureau and Circular #13, their hopes were soon downplayed as superstition akin to belief in Santa Claus.&lt;ref&gt;McFeely, ''Yankee Stepfather'' (1994), p. 105. "That Howard and his men, unable to sustain their stated policy, spent the fall trying to make the Negroes believe that forty acres was just 'a la mode Santa Claus' was, in reality, just an admission that a group of white generals had failed their job and not proof that the freedmen were foolish or superstitious."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, "Forty Acres and a Mule" (1906), p. 46. "For several years after the close of the Civil War, the Negroes of the South believed that the estates of the whites were to be confiscated by the Washington Government, and that each Negro head of a family would obtain from the property thus confiscated 'forty acres and a mule.' Some old Negroes still believe that the homestead and the mule will be given to them. This belief has often, especially in late years, been ridiculed as the childish dream of an ignorant people; for it is assumed that the negro had no reason for expecting land and stock from the Government. The purpose of this paper is to show that the expectations of the blacks were justified by the policies of the Government and the actions of its agents, and also to show that rascals took advantage of these expectations to swindle the ignorant freedmen."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hope for "40 acres and a mule" specifically was prevalent beginning in early 1865. The expectation of "40 acres" came from the explicit terms of Sherman's Field Order and the Freedmen's Bureau bill. The "mule" may have been added simply as an obvious necessity for achieving prosperity through agriculture.&lt;ref name=Webster94&gt;Webster, ''Operation of the Freedmen's Bureau in South Carolina'' (1916), pp. [https://archive.org/stream/operationfreed01websrich#page/94/mode/2up 94]–95.&lt;/ref&gt; ("Forty acres" was a slogan, which though it did appear often in formal declarations, represented a wide variety of different arrangements for land ownership and farming.)&lt;ref&gt;Saville, ''The Work of Reconstruction'' (1994), p. 19. "Not only does the 'forty acre' slogan obscure values that are foreign to the idea of land as a commodity, but, by drawing attention to a fixed measure of land, it tends to distort the character of the farming that ex-slaves undertook. Sherman's Field Order 15, issued in January 1865, set forty acres as the maximum amount of land that freed heads of households might claim [...]. Nevertheless, freed families in the low country seldom attempted to cultivate land in lots as large or as regularly defined as forty acres."&lt;/ref&gt;

A counter-rumor spread among Southern whites that when the land was ''not'' redistributed on Christmas, angry blacks would launch a violent insurrection. Alabama and Mississippi passed laws forming White [[paramilitary]] groups, which violently disarmed free black people.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Black Codes'' (1965), p. 56. "There was one other erroneous rumor—to some extent a consequence of the forty-acres-and-a-mule rumor—which contributed to bad race relations in the South in 1865. It was the more foolish—because totally unfounded—idea that, disappointed at not receiving the expected land, the Negroes would rise in a bloody rebellion at Christmas. Mississippi quickly passed one law providing for the immediate organization of volunteer militia companies and another outlawing possession of weapons by Negroes. The militia proceeded to disarm the Negroes in such a brutal fashion as to cause much criticism. Alabama Negroes were disarmed by similar methods with like results."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wage labor===

Southern farmowners complained that because they were waiting for land, the newly free blacks would not readily sign long-term labor contracts.&lt;ref name=Wilson55 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Whitelaw Reid]], ''After The War: A Southern Tour (May 1, 1865 to May 1, 1866.)'' London: Samson Low, Son, &amp; Marston, 1866, p. [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/genpub/afj8942.0001.001/346?page=root;size=100;view=image 336]; cited in Foner, "Languages of Changes" (1988), p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), p. 15. "The impact of the labor shortage was exacerbated by a black agenda that dovetailed with neither the need of the planters nor the expectations or the Northern occupiers. Seeking independence from white control, they resisted the work forms of slavery, refusing to labor in gangs or to take direction from overseers or even drivers."&lt;/ref&gt; South Carolina Governor [[James Lawrence Orr]] asked Johnson in 1866 to continue pushing his land policy, writing that "complete restoration will restore complete harmony".&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black hopes for land came to be seen as a major barrier to economic productivity, and forces from both South and North worked hard to dispel them.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Black Codes'' (1965), p. 57. "In a nutshell, the sum of army and Freedmen's Bureau policies was: protect the Negroes from violence and actual enslavement, but keep as many as possible on the plantations and ''compel'' them to work. Both agencies preserved 'white man's rule,' and though both of them did, as George Bently said of the Freedmen's Bureau, 'maintain a fairly strong guard against any form of re-enslavement of the Negroes', their interest in the welfare and happiness of the freedmen did not, as a whole, extend far beyond that safeguard in 1865 and 1866. It is also as true of one as of the other that its policies, in the main, were 'those that planters and other businessmen desired.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Southern governments passed "Black Codes" to prevent blacks from owning or leasing land, and to restrict their freedom of movement.&lt;ref name=McKenzie69 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), pp. 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Agents of the Freedmen's Bureau now told blacks that redistribution was impossible and that they would need to perform wage labor to survive. If they could not persuade people to sign contracts, they would insist forcefully.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), pp. 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Conway, the Bureau Commissioner in Louisiana, ordered: "Hire them out! Cut wood! Do anything to avoid a state of idleness."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Even Rufus Saxton, who campaigned actively for black property in the Sea Islands, issued a Circular instructing his agents to dispel the rumor of redistribution at New Year's 1866.&lt;ref name=Webster94 /&gt; (The unfunded Bureau drew its own finances from profits generated by freedpeople under contract.)&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction'', p. [https://archive.org/stream/blackreconstruc00dubo#page/602/mode/2up 602].&lt;/ref&gt; Although some Whites continued to press for colonization, most now believed that black labor could be recuperated through the wage system.&lt;ref name=McKenzie69&gt;McKenzie, "Freedmen and the Soil in the Upper South" (1993), pp. 68–69. "A majority of white landowners, though, dismissed the twin goals of black colonization and white immigration as impractical and unnecessary and believed it possible to rely upon the labor of the ex-slaves. Most Tennesseans believed that in order to use black labor effectively it would be necessary to restrict the mobility of blacks and to fashion land and labor arrangements that resembled slavery as closely as possible".&lt;/ref&gt;

According to many historians, economic negotiations between blacks and whites in the South thus unfolded within the parameters dictated by the Johnson administration.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 96. "The broad framework of a new economics for the South was prescribed in the North, but the infinite detail evolved in a species of economic warfare between white employers and Negro employees."&lt;/ref&gt; Southern plantation owners pushed blacks toward servitude, while the Republican Congress pushed for free wage labor and civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, "Freedmen and the Soil in the Upper South" (1993), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, under this framework, [[sharecropping]] emerged as the dominant mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, ''At Freedom's Edge'' (1991), pp. 20–21. "Croppers had to accept employer supervision of virtually every dimension of their farming activity. [...] Still, at its inception, sharecropping was far more popular among blacks than the annual-wage system."&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians, such as Robert McKenzie, have challenged the prevalence of this "standard scenario" and argued that land ownership fluctuated significantly during the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, "Freedmen and the Soil in the Upper South" (1993), pp. 81–84. "Exploration of this sort has proven that, with regard to Tennessee, the standard scenario for the post-emancipation transformation of southern agriculture is factually incorrect in two fundamental respects. First, the institutional reorganization of agriculture in the state was neither swift nor thorough, and it did not result in the immediate predominance of sharecropping among the former slaves. Between 1860 and 1880 the number and average size of farm units across the state underwent major changes, but these reflected first and foremost a remarkable increase in the number of white owners. Although sharecropping and tenancy did grow in importance, as late as 1880 the typical freedman was more likely to have been a wage laborer than a cropper or tenant. Second, despite the continued concentration of blacks at the lowest rung of the agricultural ladder, in Tennessee there was considerable fluidity between the landholding and landless ranks. Throughout the 1870s a small but significant proportion of former slaves purchased farms of their own; at the same time, however, a substantial fraction of those who began the decade as owners had lost title to their farms by 1880".&lt;/ref&gt; black land ownership did increase across the South.&lt;ref name=WEBDB603 /&gt;

===Tidewater Virginia===
Many blacks who had settled on property surrounding Hampton were forced to leave by various means.&lt;ref name=Bonekemper175 /&gt; These included Johnson's aggressive restoration policy, Black Codes passed by the Virginia legislature, and with vigilante enforcement by returning Confederates.&lt;ref&gt;Engs, ''Freedom's First Generation'' (1979), pp. 87, 99–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Union troops also forcefully evicted settlers, sometimes provoking violent standoffs; many blacks came to trust the Freedmen's Bureau no more than they did the Rebels.&lt;ref name=Bonekemper175&gt;Bonekemper, "Negro Ownership of Real Property" (1970), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engs, ''Freedom's First Generation'' (1979), pp. 102–104. "When the freedmen in Wilder's district were informed of the new policy, they were at first unbelieving, and then infuriated. They suspected that local agents like Wilder were lying to them. When Commissioner Howard and Subcommissioner Brown visited Hampton encouraging freedmen to return to their former homes and work for wages, the black began to realize the truth. It was the president and national government that were defaulting on Northern wartime promises. [...] they armed themselves and threatened to respond violently to any effort to evict them. In such instances, white Union troops, many of whom had recently fought in the same army with these black settlers, were ordered to drive the squatters off restored land at gunpoint."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866 Tidewater's refugee camps were still full, and many of their residents were sick and dying. Relations with Northern and Southern whites had become violently hostile. The whites (military occupiers and local residents) agreed on a plan to deport the freedpeople back to their counties of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Engs, ''Freedom's First Generation'' (1979), pp. 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the turbulence of restoration, land ownership steadily increased. Hampton already had at least some black landowners, such as the family of [[American Revolutionary War]] veteran [[Caesar Tarrant]].&lt;ref name=Bonekemper166&gt;Bonekemper, "Negro Ownership of Real Property" (1970), p. 166. "Free Negro ownership of land was not a recent development in Hampton and its environs. As early as 1797, Caesar Tarrant, a black, devised his houses and lots by will to his "loving wife." In addition to his Hampton holdings, he owned almost 2,700 acres of bounty land in Ohio, which had been granted to him for his services as a pilot in the Virginia Navy in the American Revolution. His daughter, Nancy Tarrant, was the only Negro landowner in Hampton in 1830."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, about eight free Negroes owned land in Hampton.&lt;ref name=Bonekemper166 /&gt; By 1870, approximately 121 free Blacks owned land in the area.&lt;ref name="Bonekemper-p177"&gt;Bonekemper, "Negro Ownership of Real Property" (1970), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who owned land before the war expanded their holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Medford, "Land and Labor" (1992), 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the blacks in Hampton formed a [[community land trust]] called Lincon's Land Association and purchased several hundred acres of surrounding land.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, "From Reconstruction to Deconstruction" (2001), p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt; Land for the Hampton Institute (later [[Hampton University]]), was acquired from 1867–1872 with assistance from [[George Whipple (missionary)|George Whipple]] of the [[American Missionary Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonekemper, "Negro Ownership of Real Property" (1970), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, "The Origin of Hampton Institute" (1925), pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; Whipple also helped to sell 44 individual lots to black owners.&lt;ref name="Bonekemper-p177" /&gt;

Many freedpeople could not afford to purchase land immediately after the war, but earned money in jobs outside farming such as fishing and oystering. Black land ownership thus increased even faster (though not for everyone) during the 1870s.&lt;ref name=Medford576&gt;Medford, "Land and Labor" (1992), pp. 575–576. "With the resources accrued from nonagricultural labor, and the knowledge that they could return to such work at any time, peninsula freedmen and women set out to enter the landed class. In none of the six counties did landholding by blacks becoming commonplace in the years immediately following emancipation. Between 1870 and 1880, however, as conditions stabilized, the quest for land brought better results."&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Charles City County, Virginia|Charles City County]], three-quarters of black farm workers owned their own farms, with an average size of 36 acres.&lt;ref name=Medford576 /&gt; In [[York County, Virginia|York County]], 50% owned their farms, which averaged 20 acres.&lt;ref&gt;Medford, "Land and Labor" (1992), p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt; (Statedwide, the number of landowners was high, but the average size of land was only 4 acres.)&lt;ref name=Engs178&gt;Engs, ''Freedom's First Generation'' (1979), pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; These relatively small farms, on relatively poor land, did not generate enormous profits.&lt;ref name=Engs178 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medford, "Land and Labor" (1992), pp. 578–579.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they did constitute a base of economic power, and blacks from this region held political office at a high rate.&lt;ref&gt;Medford, "Land and Labor" (1992), p. 581.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engs, ''Freedom's First Generation'' (1979), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Survivors of the camps also achieved a high level of land ownership and business success in the town of Hampton itself.&lt;ref&gt;Engs, ''Freedom's First Generation'' (1979), pp. 174–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea Islands===

The May 29 amnesty proclamation did not apply to many Sea Islands landowners; however, most of these had secured special pardons directly from Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; General Rufus Saxton was overwhelmed with ownership claims for properties in the "Sherman Reserve".&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Saxton wrote to Howard on September 5, 1865, asking him to protect black landownership on the Sea Islands:&lt;ref&gt;Hahn et al., ''Land and Labor, 1865'' (2008), p. 402; document transcribed, p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|General, I have the honor to report that the old owners of the lands on the Sea Islands, are making strong efforts to regain possession of them. These Islands were set apart for the colonization of the freedmen, by General Sherman's Special Field Order no. 15: Head Quarters Military Division of the Mississippi: In pursuance of this Order, which was issued as a military necessity, with the full approval and sanction of the Honorable Secretary of War, I, as you are already aware, have colonized some forty (40) thousand Freedmen, on forty (40) acre Tracts. promising them that they should have promissory titles to the same.

I consider that the faith of the Government is solemnly pledged to these people, who have been faithful to it. and that we have no right now to dispossess them of their lands.

I believe that Congress will decide that Genl Sherman's Order has all the binding effects of a Statute, and that Mr. Stanton will sustain you in not giving up any of these lands to their late owners.

I respectfully ask that this Order which I have carried out in good faith, Shall now be enforced, and that no part or parcel of the lands which have been disposed of under its just provisions, shall, under any circumstances, be restored to the former owners. It seems to me not as wise or prudent to do injustice to those who have always been loyal and true, in order to be lenient to those who have done their best to destroy the nation's life.}}

Circular no. 15, issued days later, led the land's former owners to increase their efforts. Saxton continued to resist, passing their written requests to Howard with the comment:&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The freedmen were promised the protection of the Government in their possession. This order was issued under a great military necessity with the approval of the War Department. I was appointed the executive officer to carry it out. More than forty thousand destitute freedmen have been provided with homes under its promises. I cannot break faith with them now by recommending the restoration of any of these lands. In my opinion this order of General Sherman is as binding as a statute.}}

Johnson dispatched Howard to the Islands, with instructions to broker a "mutually satisfactory" settlement. Howard understood that this implied a complete restoration of pre-war ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), pp. 80–81. "In October, a highly choleric Johnson personally, orally, and explicitly ordered Howard himself to go to South Carolina to effect a settlement 'mutually satisfactory' to the freedmen and the owners. Doubtless as Johnson intended, Howard interpreted this to mean that complete restoration was mandatory."&lt;/ref&gt; He informed the islanders of Johnson's intention. But (with support from Stanton, who felt comfortable with a literal interpretation of the phrase "mutually satisfactory")&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 52. "He telegraphed Howard at Charleston that the president's order only called for him to see if the freedmen and the former owners could arrive at a mutually satisfactory agreement. If they could not, Howard should not have disturbed the freedmen in their possession."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hahn et al., ''Land and Labor, 1865'' (2008), p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; appointed a sympathetic Captain, Alexander P. Ketchum, to form a commission overseeing the transition.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Ketchum and Saxton proceeded to resist resettlement claims by Confederate whites.&lt;ref name=Williamson81&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource-multi|Protest of the Freedmen of Edisto Island to General Howard, 1865|Protest of the Freedmen of Edisto Island to President Johnson, 1865}}

The settlers formed a [[solidarity]] network to resist reclamation of their lands, and proved willing to defend their homes with vigorous displays of force.&lt;ref name=Williamson81 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hahn et al., ''Land and Labor, 1865'' (2008), p. 408. "Understanding the importance of solidarity in resisting the landowners' demands, freedpeople organized themselves and forged links with their counterparts on other estates. Led by the committee that had framed the petitions to General Howard and President Johnson, residents of Edisto vowed to 'stand by each other, not for any violent action—but simply to refuse to contract for any white owners.'"&lt;/ref&gt; The Sea Island homesteaders also wrote directly to Howard and Johnson, insisting that the government keep its promise and maintain their homesteads.

However, the prevailing political wind continued to favor the Southern landowners. Saxton and Ketchum lost their positions; [[Daniel Sickles]] and [[Robert K. Scott]] assumed power.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1866–1867, Sickles turned the Union Army on the settlers, evicting all those that could not produce the correct deed. Black settlers retained control over 1,565 titles amounting to 63,000 acres.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), p. 84. "During the winter of 1866, Sickles simply used his administrative power to do what Johnson and the owners had been unable to do by judicial and legal means. [...] The refusal of the military to recognize any papers which were in any degree erroneous resulted, finally, in only 1,565 titled (representing about 63,000 acres), being valided. By the same order that disallowed the Negro Code, Sickles also directed freedmen everywhere in the state to contract for the coming year or to leave their places. In February, squads of soldiers went through the plantations forcing those settlers without valid claims either to contract with the owners or leave."&lt;/ref&gt; Scott recounted in his report to Congress: "The officers of these detachments in many instances took from the freedmen their certificates, declared them worthless, and destroyed them in their presence. Upon refusing to accept the contracts offered, the people in several instances were thrust out into the highways, where, being without shelter, many perished from small-pox, which prevailed to an alarming extent among them."&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''Operation of the Freedmen's Bureau in South Carolina'' (1916), p. [https://archive.org/stream/operationfreed01websrich#page/100/mode/2up 101]''; see also Congressional Serial Set, Issue 1276, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QjwLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA114&amp;lpg=RA1-PA114#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 114].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Rose (1964) p. 296, small pox was already known as "Government lump"; Rose explains in a footnote: "Those who had the 'lump' were 'Union,' and those who didn't were 'Secesh.'!"&lt;/ref&gt;

Soldiers continued to evict settlers and enforce work agreements, leading in 1867 to a large-scale armed standoff between the Army and a group of farmers who would not renew their contract with a plantation owner.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''After Slavery'' (1965), pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; General Davis Tillson in Georgia ordered a modification to the title of black landowners "as to give a man holding one, not forty acres, but as much land as he could work ''well'', say from ten to fifteen acres—and that the balance of the land should be turned over to Messrs. Scuyler and Winchester, who should be allowed to hire the remaining freed people who wish to work for them [...]".&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p.&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/ref&gt; 90% of the land on Skidaway Island was confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, "Uncle Billy" (1995), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The (second) Second Freedmen's Bureau bill, passed in July 1866 over Johnson's veto, stipulated the freedpeople whose lands had been restored to Confederate owners could pay $1.25 per acre for up to 20 acres of land in St. Luke and St. Helena parishes of [[Beaufort County, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name=Oubre67 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster, ''Operation of the Freedmen's Bureau in South Carolina'' (1916), p. [https://archive.org/stream/operationfreed01websrich#page/102/mode/2up 102].&lt;/ref&gt; This district was overseen by Major [[Martin Delany|Martin R. Delaney]], an abolitionist and advocate of black land ownership.&lt;ref name=Oubre67&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), pp. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; About 1,900 families with land titles resettled in Beaufort County, buying 19,040 acres of land at relatively low rates.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), pp. 194–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people remained on the islands and maintained the Gullah culture of their ancestors. Several hundred thousand Gullah people live on the Sea Islands today. Their claim to the land has been threatened in recent decades by developers seeking to build vacation resorts.&lt;ref&gt;Dahleen Glanton, "[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/06/0607_wiregullah.html Gullah Culture in Danger of Fading Away]", ''National Geographic News'' (''Chicago Tribune''), 8 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Davis Bend===

Thomas denied their request and accused Montgomery of having promoted the petition to further his own profits.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, ''Pursuit of a Dream'' (1981), pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery appealed to Joseph Davis, who had returned to Mississippi in October 1865 and was staying in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]].

Samuel Thomas was eventually removed from his post. Joseph Davis regained control of his plantation in 1867 and promptly sold it to Benjamin Montgomery for $300,000.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, ''Pursuit of a Dream'' (1981), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; This price, $75 per acre, was comparatively low.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, ''Pursuit of a Dream'' (1981), pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction itself was illegal because the Mississippi Black Codes outlawed sale of property to blacks; Davis and Montgomery therefore conducted the deal in secret.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, ''Pursuit of a Dream'' (1981), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery invited free blacks to settle the land and work there. In 1887, led by Benjamin's son [[Isaiah Montgomery]], the group founded a new settlement at [[Mound Bayou, Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), pp. 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt; Mound Bayou remains an autonomous and virtually all-Black community.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Hua, "[http://practice.sph.umich.edu/practice/files/Life%20in%20Md_Bayou_MS2010.pdf Life in Mound Bayou, Mississippi: Findings from a Community Survey]"; University of Michigan School of Public Health report, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===

Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner continued to support land reform for freedpeople, but were opposed by a large bloc of politicians who did not want to violate property rights or redistribute capital.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction'', p. [https://archive.org/stream/blackreconstruc00dubo#page/368/mode/2up 368].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many radical Northerners withdrew their support for land reform in the years following the war. One reason for the shift in political opinion was fear by the Republicans that land ownership might lead Blacks to align with Democrats for economic reasons. In general, politicians turned their focus to the legal status of freedpeople.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), pp. 172–174.&lt;/ref&gt; In the analysis of [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[black suffrage]] became more politically palatable precisely as an inexpensive alternative to well-funded agrarian reform.&lt;ref name=WEBDB222&gt;Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction'', pp. [https://archive.org/stream/blackreconstruc00dubo#page/222/mode/2up 222]–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
By the 1870s, blacks had abandoned hope of federal land redistribution, but many still saw "forty acres and a mule" as the key to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, "Freedmen and the Soil in the Upper South" (1993), p. 68. "Initially the freedmen expected the federal government to facilitate this dream through the redistribution of their masters' plantations. Although forced ultimately to relinquish the hope of federal intervention, they nonetheless held tightly throughout the Reconstruction era to the vision of an independent black yeomanry."&lt;/ref&gt; Black land ownership in the South increased steadily despite the failure of federal Reconstruction.&lt;ref name=Mitchell526&gt;Mitchell, "From Reconstruction to Deconstruction" (2001), p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt; One quarter of black farmers in the South owned their land by 1900. Near the coast, they owned an average of 27 acres; inland, an average of 48 acres.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, 63% of Southern white farmers owned their land.&lt;ref&gt;Oubre, ''Forty Acres and a Mule'' (1978), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this land was simply bought through private transactions.&lt;ref name=Mitchell526 /&gt;

In 1910, black Americans owned 15,000,000 acres of land, most of it in Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. This figure has since declined to 5,500,000 acres in 1980 and to 2,000,000 acres in 1997.&lt;ref name=Otabor2&gt;Otabor and Nembhard, ''Land Loss'' (2012), p. 2. "A picture of the magnitude of the issue of land ownership and record titles is that in 1910, African American land ownership in the United States reached its peak of 15 million acres with nearly all of it in Mississippi, Alabama and the Carolinas, but by 1997 the numbers had declined drastically to about 2.3 million acres (according to Thomas, Pennick and Gray, 2004 based on data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture). The rate of decline of African‐American land holdings far exceeds the loss among other ethnic groups. Comparing the rate of African‐American farmland loss to other groups in 1997, blacks lost fifty‐three percent (53%) compared to 28.8% for other ethnic groups, while whites experienced steady growth (Civil Rights Action Team, quoted by Gilbert and Sharp, 2002)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McDougall127 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, "From Reconstruction to Deconstruction" (2001), p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this land is not the area held by black families in 1910; beyond the "[[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]]", it is located in Texas, Oklahoma, and California.&lt;ref name=Mitchell527&gt;Mitchell, "From Reconstruction to Deconstruction" (2001), p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of Black farmers has decreased from 925,708 in 1920 to 18,000 in 1997; the number of white farmers has also decreased, but much more slowly.&lt;ref name=Mitchell527 /&gt; black American land ownership has diminished more than that of any other ethnic group, while white land ownership has increased.&lt;ref name=Otabor2 /&gt; black families who inherit land across generations without obtaining an explicit title (often resulting in [[Concurrent estate|tenancy in common]] by multiple descendents) may have difficulty gaining government benefits and risk losing their land completely.&lt;ref name=McDougall127&gt;McDougall, "Black Landowners Beware" (1979–1980), pp. 127–135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otabor and Nembhard, ''Land Loss'' (2012), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Outright fraud and lynchings have also been used to strip black people of their land.&lt;ref&gt;Otabor and Nembhard, ''Land Loss'' (2012), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDougall, "Black Landowners Beware" (1979–1980), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black landowners are common targets of [[eminent domain]] laws invoked to make way for public works projects.&lt;ref name=McDougall158&gt;McDougall, "Black Landowners Beware" (1979–1980), pp. 158–160.&lt;/ref&gt; At Harris Neck in the Sea Islands, a group of Gullah freedpeople retained 2,681 acres of high-quality land due to the Will of the plantation owner Marg[a]ret Ann Harris. About 100 black farmers continued to live at Harris Neck until 1942, when they were forced off the land because of a plan to build an Air Force base. The land was used freely by local white authorities until 1962, when it was turned over to the federal Fish and Wildlife Service and became [[Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge]]. Ownership of the land remains contested.&lt;ref name=McDougall158 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terry Dickson, "[http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/011407/geo_7329032.shtml Families join in new quest for Harris Neck land]"; ''Florida Times-Union'', 14 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shalia Dewan, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/01/us/01harris.html?scp=1&amp;sq=harris%20neck%20land%20trust&amp;st=cse&amp;_r=moc.semityn.www black Landowners Fight to Reclaim Georgia Home]"; ''New York Times'', 30 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has long been viewed as a cause for the decline in black agriculture. According to a 1997 report by the USDA's own Civil Rights Action Team:&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.federationsoutherncoop.com/pigford/research/CRAT%20Report%201997.pdf Civil Rights at the United States Department of Agriculture: A Report by the Civil Rights Action Team]", USDA, February 1997, p. 2; quoted in Mitchell (2001), p. 530.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are some who call the USDA 'the last plantation.' An 'old line' department, USDA was one of the last federal agencies to integrate and perhaps the last to include women and minorities in leadership positions. Considered a stubborn bureaucracy and slow to change, USDA is also perceived as playing a key role in what some see as a conspiracy to force minority and socially disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan practices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A class action lawsuit has accused the USDA of systematic discrimination against black farmers from 1981–1999. In ''[[Pigford v. Glickman]]'' (1999), District Court Judge [[Paul L. Friedman]] ruled in favor of the farmers and ordered the USDA to pay financial damages for loss of land and revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Otabor and Nembhard, ''Land Loss'' (2012), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the status of full compensation for affected farmers remains unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;Otabor and Nembhard, ''Land Loss'' (2012), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===

The phrase "40 acres and a mule" has come to symbolize the broken promise that [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction policies]] would offer economic justice for African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |url=http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2004-01/reconstruction.html |journal=Humanities |title=Forty Acres and a Mule: The Ruined Hope of Reconstruction |volume=25 |issue=1 Jan./Feb. |first=Danielle |last=Alexander |year=2004 |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, "From Reconstruction to Deconstruction" (2001), p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "40 acres and a mule" promise featured prominently in the ''Pigford'' decision. Ruling that the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] had discriminated against African-American farmers, Friedman wrote: "Forty acres and a mule. The government broke that promise to African American farmers. Over one hundred years later, the USDA broke its promise to Mr. James Beverly."&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, "From Reconstruction to Deconstruction" (2001), p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reparations===

"40 Acres and a Mule" is often discussed in the context of [[Reparations for slavery debate in the United States|reparations for slavery]]. However, strictly speaking, the various policies offering 'forty acres' provided land for political and economic reasons—and with a price tag—and not as unconditional compensation for lifetimes of unpaid labor.&lt;ref&gt;Adjoa A. Aiyetoro, "[http://law.nyu.edu/ecm_dlv2/groups/public/@nyu_law_website__journals__annual_survey_of_american_law/documents/documents/ecm_pro_065061.pdf Formulating Reparations Litigation Through the Eyes of the Movement", ''NYU Annual Survey of American Law]'' 58; 18 February 18, 2003, pp. 458–[http://law.nyu.edu/ecm_dlv2/groups/public/@nyu_law_website__journals__annual_survey_of_american_law/documents/documents/ecm_pro_065061.pdf#page=4 460]. "However, this land was not a gift in recognition of the forced free labor that had been extracted from the refugees and the freed men and women and the inhumane treatment to which they and their ancestors had been subjected. Rather, the loyal refugees and freedmen chosen to receive this land were ''required'' to pay annually a rent [...]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John David |last1=Smith |url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Enduring-Myth-of-Forty/32583 |title=The Enduring Myth of 'Forty Acres and a Mule |journal=Chronicle of Higher Education |volume=49 |issue=24 |date=February 21, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fourteen Points''' was a statement of principles for [[peace]] that was to be used for [[peace negotiation]]s in order to end [[World War I]]. The principles were outlined in a January 8, 1918 speech on war aims and peace terms to the United States Congress by President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. But his main [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] colleagues ([[Georges Clemenceau]] of France, [[David Lloyd George]] of the United Kingdom, and [[Vittorio Orlando]] of Italy) were skeptical of the applicability of [[Wilsonian]] [[Idealism in international relations|idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Irwin Unger]], ''These United States'' (2007) 561.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States had joined the Allied Powers in fighting the [[Central Powers]] on April 6, 1917. Its entry into the war had in part been due to Germany's resumption of [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|submarine warfare]] against merchant ships trading with France and Britain and also the interception of the [[Zimmermann Telegram]]. However, Wilson wanted to avoid the United States' involvement in the long-standing European tensions between the [[great power]]s; if America was going to fight, he wanted to try to separate that participation in the war from nationalistic disputes or ambitions. The need for moral aims was made more important, when after the fall of the [[Russian Provisional Government|Russian government]], the [[Bolsheviks]] disclosed [[Sykes–Picot Agreement#Events after public disclosure of the plan|secret treaties]] made between the Allies. Wilson's speech also responded to [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Lenin's]] [[Decree on Peace]] of November 1917, immediately after the October Revolution in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=2h82DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Great War and American Foreign Policy, 1914-24|last=Hannigan|first=Robert E.|date=2016-11-11|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=|isbn=9780812248593|location=|pages=125–129|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech made by Wilson took many [[Progressive Era|domestic progressive ideas]] and translated them into foreign policy ([[free trade]], [[secret treaty|open agreements]], [[democracy]] and [[self-determination]]). Three days earlier United Kingdom Prime Minister Lloyd George had made a speech setting out Britain's war aims which bore some similarity to Wilson's speech but which proposed reparations be paid by the Central Powers and which was more vague in its promises to the non-Turkish subjects of the Ottoman Empire. The Fourteen Points in the speech were based on the research of the [[The Inquiry|Inquiry]], a team of about 150 advisers led by foreign-policy adviser [[Edward M. House]], into the topics likely to arise in the anticipated [[peace conference]].

==Background==
[[File:Original_Fourteen_Point_Speech_page1.pdf|thumb|Original Fourteen Points speech, January 8, 1918.]]

The immediate cause of the United States' entry into [[World War I]] in April 1917 was the German announcement of renewed [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|unrestricted submarine warfare]] and the subsequent sinking of ships with Americans on board. But President Wilson's war aims went beyond the defense of maritime interests. In his War Message to Congress, Wilson declared that the United States' objective was "to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world." In several speeches earlier in the year, Wilson sketched out his vision of an end to the war that would bring a [[Wikiquote:Woodrow Wilson|"just and secure peace," not merely "a new balance of power."]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wilson’s Fourteen Points, 1918 - 1914–1920 - Milestones - Office of the Historian|url = https://history.state.gov/milestones/1914-1920/fourteen-points|website = history.state.gov|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Wilson subsequently initiated a secret series of studies named [[the Inquiry]], primarily focused on Europe, and carried out by a group in New York which included geographers, historians and political scientists; the group was directed by [[Edward M. House|Colonel House]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Heckscher, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; Their job was to study Allied and American policy in virtually every region of the globe and analyze economic, social, and political facts likely to come up in discussions during the peace conference.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = President Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points|url = http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=62|website = www.ourdocuments.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group produced and collected nearly 2,000 separate reports and documents plus at least 1,200 maps.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = President Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points|url = http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=62|website = www.ourdocuments.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studies culminated in a speech by Wilson to Congress on January 8, 1918, wherein he articulated America's long-term war objectives. The speech was the clearest expression of intention made by any of the belligerent nations, and it projected Wilson's progressive domestic policies into the international arena.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Heckscher, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech, known as the Fourteen Points, was developed from a set of diplomatic points by Wilson&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Legal Foundation and Borders of Israel Under International Law: A Treatise on Jewish Sovereignty Over the Land of Israel|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yqk3XE196GsC|publisher = Mazo Publishers|date = 2008-01-01|isbn = 9789657344521|first = Howard|last = Grief | authorlink = Howard Grief|page = 297}}&lt;/ref&gt; and territorial points drafted by the Inquiry's general secretary, [[Walter Lippmann]], and his colleagues, [[Isaiah Bowman]], [[Sidney Mezes]], and [[David Hunter Miller]].&lt;ref name="Hodgson"&gt;Godfrey Hodgson, ''Woodrow Wilson's Right Hand: The Life of Colonel Edward M. House'' (Yale University Press, 2006), pp. 160-63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lippmann's draft territorial points were a direct response to the [[secret treaties]] of the European Allies, which Lippmann had been shown by Secretary of War [[Newton D. Baker]].&lt;ref name="Hodgson" /&gt; Lippmann's task according to House was "to take the secret treaties, analyze the parts which were tolerable, and separate them from those which we regarded as intolerable, and then develop a position which conceded as much to the Allies as it could, but took away the poison. ... It was all keyed upon the secret treaties."&lt;ref name="Hodgson" /&gt;

In the speech, Wilson directly addressed what he perceived as the causes for the world war by calling for the abolition of secret treaties, a [[Arms control|reduction in armaments]], an [[League of Nations mandate|adjustment in colonial claims]] in the interests of both native peoples and colonists, and [[freedom of the seas]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = President Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points|url = http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=62|website = www.ourdocuments.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson also made proposals that would ensure world peace in the future. For example, he proposed the [[Free trade|removal of economic barriers]] between nations, the promise of [[self-determination]] for national minorities,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = President Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points|url = http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=62|website = www.ourdocuments.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a world organization that would guarantee the "political independence and territorial integrity [of] great and small states alike"—a [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Though [[Idealism in international relations|Wilson's idealism]] pervades the Fourteen Points, he also had more practical objectives in mind. He hoped to keep Russia in the war by convincing the Bolsheviks that they would receive a better peace from the Allies, to bolster Allied morale, and to undermine German war support. The address was well received in the United States and Allied nations, and even by Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, as a landmark of enlightenment in international relations. Wilson subsequently used the Fourteen Points as the basis for negotiating the&amp;nbsp;[[Treaty of Versailles]]&amp;nbsp;that ended the war.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wilson’s Fourteen Points, 1918 - 1914–1920 - Milestones - Office of the Historian|url = https://history.state.gov/milestones/1914-1920/fourteen-points|website = history.state.gov|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech to Congress, President Wilson declared fourteen points which he regarded as the only possible basis of an enduring peace. They were according to him:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Avalon Project - President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points|url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/wilson14.asp|website = avalon.law.yale.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
I. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be [[Secret treaty|no private international understandings]] of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view.

II. Absolute [[freedom of navigation]] upon the seas, outside territorial waters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international covenants.

III. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an [[Free trade|equality of trade conditions]] among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance.

IV. Adequate guarantees given and taken that [[Arms control|national armaments will be reduced]] to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.

V. A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial [[League of Nations mandate|adjustment of all colonial claims]], based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable government whose title is to be determined.}}

=== Territorial issues ===
[[File:The President of The United States of America Woodrow Wilson Arbitration Decision Of Boundaries Between Armenia And Turkey.JPG|thumb|Map of [[Wilsonian Armenia]]. The borders decision was made by Wilson]]
{{quote|VI. The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|evacuation of all Russian territory]] and such a settlement of [[Russian Revolution|all questions affecting Russia]] as will secure the best and freest cooperation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the [[Russian Civil War|independent determination of her own political development and national policy]] and assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations under institutions of her own choosing; and, more than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself desire. The treatment accorded Russia by her sister nations in the months to come will be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own interests, and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy.

VII. [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and restored]], without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys in common with all other free nations. No other single act will serve as this will serve to restore confidence among the nations in the laws which they have themselves set and determined for the government of their relations with one another. Without [[Belgium in World War I|this healing act]] the whole structure and validity of international law is forever impaired.

VIII. [[Western Front (World War I)|All French territory should be freed]] and the invaded portions restored, and the wrong done to [[Franco-Prussian War|France by Prussia in 1871]] in the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|matter of Alsace-Lorraine]], which has unsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years, should be righted, in order that peace may once more be made secure in the interest of all.

IX. A readjustment of the frontiers of [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] should be effected along clearly recognizable [[Italian irredentism|lines of nationality]].

X. The people of [[Austria-Hungary]], whose place among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the freest opportunity to [[Self-determination|autonomous development]].

XI. [[Romania during World War I|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] should be evacuated; occupied territories restored; Serbia accorded free and secure access to the sea; and the relations of the several Balkan states to one another determined by friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance and nationality; and international guarantees of the political and economic independence and territorial integrity of the several Balkan states should be entered into.

XII. The Turkish portion of the present [[Ottoman Empire]] should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule]] should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of [[Self-determination|autonomous development]], and the [[Dardanelles]] should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees.

XIII. An [[Second Polish Republic|independent Polish state]] should be erected which should include the [[History of Poland (1918–39)|territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations]], which should be assured a [[Polish Corridor|free and secure access to the sea]], and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant.}}

===Reaction by the Allied Powers===
[[File:Wilsons Fourteen Points -- European Baby Show.png|thumb|Wilson with his 14 points choosing between competing claims. Babies represent claims of the British, French, Italians, Polish, Russians, and enemy. American political cartoon, 1919.]]
President Wilson at first considered abandoning his speech after Lloyd George delivered a speech outlining British war aims, many of which were similar to Wilson's aspirations, at [[Caxton Hall]] on January 5, 1918. Lloyd George stated that he had consulted leaders of "the Great Dominions overseas" before making his speech, so it would appear Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Newfoundland were in broad agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Prime_Minister_Lloyd_George_on_the_British_War_Aims|title=Prime Minister Lloyd George on the British War Aims|last=|first=|date=|website=The World War I Document Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was persuaded by his adviser Colonel House to go ahead, and his speech overshadowed Lloyd George's, and is better remembered by posterity.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2002, pp.383-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech was made without prior coordination or consultation with Wilson's counterparts in Europe. Clemenceau, upon hearing of the Fourteen Points, was said to have sarcastically proclaimed ''The good Lord only had [[Ten Commandments|ten]]!'' ({{Lang|fr|Le bon Dieu n'en avait que dix !}}). As a major public statement of war aims, it became the basis for the terms of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|German surrender at the end of the First World War]]. After the speech, Colonel House worked to secure the acceptance of the Fourteen Points by [[Triple Entente|Entente]] leaders.  On October 16, 1918, President Woodrow Wilson and [[Sir William Wiseman, 10th Baronet|Sir William Wiseman]], the head of British intelligence in America, had an interview.  This interview was one reason why the German government accepted the Fourteen Points and the stated principles for peace negotiations.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The report was made as negotiation points, and later the Fourteen Points were accepted by [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] on November 1, 1918.  Britain later signed off on all of the points except the [[freedom of the seas]].&lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2002, pp.384&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom also wanted Germany to make [[World War I reparations|reparation payments]] for the war, and thought that should be added to the Fourteen Points. The speech was delivered 10 months before the [[First Armistice at Compiègne|Armistice with Germany]] and became the basis for the terms of the German surrender, as negotiated at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hakim | first = Joy | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = War, Peace, and All That Jazz | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | location = New York | pages = 16–20 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0195327233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction by the Central Powers===

The speech was widely disseminated as an instrument of Allied [[propaganda]] and was translated into many languages for global dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt; Copies were also dropped behind German lines, to encourage the [[Central Powers]] to surrender in the expectation of a just settlement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = President Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points|url = http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=62|website = www.ourdocuments.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in a note sent to Wilson by Prince [[Maximilian of Baden]], the German [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|imperial chancellor]], in October 1918 requested an immediate armistice and peace negotiations on the basis of the Fourteen Points.&lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, pp. 479-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction in America===
[[Theodore Roosevelt]], in an article "The League of Nations" published by ''Metropolitan Magazine'' (January 1919), warned: "If the League of Nations is built on a document as high-sounding and as meaningless as the speech in which Mr. Wilson laid down his fourteen points, it will simply add one more scrap to the diplomatic waste paper basket. Most of these fourteen points ... would be interpreted ... to mean anything or nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in ''Newer Roosevelt Messages'', (ed. Griffith, William, New York: The Current Literature Publishing Company 1919). vol III, p 1047.&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[William Borah]] after 1918 wished "this treacherous and treasonable scheme" of the League of Nations to be "buried in hell" and promised that if he had his way it would be "20,000 leagues under the sea".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Ivo Daalder]] and [[James G. Lindsay|James Lindsay]], ''America Unbound: The Bush Revolution in Foreign Policy'' (Washington: Brookings Institution Press,  2003), p 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilson's speech vs. Treaty of Versailles===
President Wilson became physically ill at the beginning of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], giving way to French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] to advance demands substantially different from Wilson's Fourteen Points. Clemenceau viewed Germany as having unfairly attained an economic victory over France, due to the heavy damage German forces dealt to France's industries even during the German retreat, and expressed dissatisfaction with France's allies at the peace conference.

Notably, [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles]], which would become known as the War Guilt Clause, was seen by the Germans as assigning full responsibility for the war and its damages on Germany; however, the same clause was included in all peace treaties and historian Sally Marks has noted that only German diplomats saw it as assigning responsibility for the war. The Allies would initially assess 269 billion [[German Goldmark|mark]]s in [[World War I reparations|reparations]]. In 1921, this figure was established at 192 billion marks. However, only a fraction of this total had to be paid. The figure was designed to look imposing and show the public that Germany was being punished, while it also recognized what Germany could not realistically pay. Germany's ability and willingness to pay that sum continues to be a topic of debate among historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Markwell |first=Donald |year=2006 |title=John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Max |last=Hantke |first2=Mark |last2=Spoerer |title=The imposed gift of Versailles: the fiscal effects of restricting the size of Germany's armed forces, 1924–9 |journal=Economic History Review |year=2010 |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=849–864 |url=http://www.ekh.lu.se/ehes/paper/Spoerer_Lund.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00512.x |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027113951/http://www.ekh.lu.se/ehes/paper/Spoerer_Lund.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany was also denied an air force, and the German army was not to exceed 100,000 men.

The text of the Fourteen Points had been widely distributed in Germany as propaganda prior to the end of the war, and was well known by the Germans. The differences between this document and the final Treaty of Versailles fueled great anger in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''The Concise Encyclopedia of World History'' (edited by John Bowle), publisher: Hutchinson of London (Great Portland Street) printed by Taylor, Garnett, Evans &amp; co. in 1958, chapter 20 by John Plamenatz (no ISBN available)&lt;/ref&gt; German outrage over reparations and the War Guilt Clause is viewed as a likely contributing factor to the rise of [[National Socialism]]. At the end of World War I, foreign armies had only entered Germany's prewar borders twice: the [[Battle of Tannenberg|advance of Russian troops into the Eastern border of Prussia]], and following the [[Battle of Mulhouse]] the settlement of the French army in the [[Thann, Haut-Rhin|Thann valley]]. This lack of any important Allied incursions contributed to the popularization of the [[stab-in-the-back myth]] in Germany after the war.

Woodrow Wilson was awarded the 1919 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his peace-making efforts.

{{wikisource|Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States}}
'''''Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States''''', 433 U.S. 299 (1977),&lt;ref name="case"&gt;{{ussc|name=Hazelwood School District v. United States|volume=433 |page=299 |pin=|year=1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a court case argued before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] on April 27, 1977. It concerned [[employment discrimination]] and was decided on June 27, 1977.

==Case==
In 1969, the [[Hazelwood School District]] in Missouri hired its first black teacher, and continued hiring black teachers ever since. In 1972, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] was amended to apply to public employers, including school districts, making the hiring of black teachers almost a necessity in order to avoid liability. However, due to statistical disparities in the hiring practices of this particular school district, as well as 55 individual cases of alleged discrimination, the United States brought suit in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]] to enjoin the school district from discriminating based on race. The District Court found in favor of the school district, saying that the ratio of black teachers to white was roughly equivalent to the ratio of black students to white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Hazelwood School District |vol=392 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=1276 |pinpoint= |court=E.D. Mo. |date=1975 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/392/1276/1580584/ |accessdate=2018-03-25 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]], which reversed the District Court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Hazelwood School District |vol=534 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=805 |pinpoint= |court=8th Cir. |date=1976  |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/534/805/339017/ |accessdate=2018-03-25 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This judgment was based on their decision to disregard the comparison to the student population, and instead compare the Hazelwood hiring statistics to the statistics of the surrounding area, including the St. Louis, MO school districts, saying that those numbers would more accurately reflect the "relevant labor market[.]"&lt;ref name="case" /&gt;{{rp|304}} Hazelwood appealed to the Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals decision, arguing that the relevant labor market statistics should not include the St. Louis numbers, because that city had imposed very strict hiring guidelines to help overcome past racial discrimination.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt;{{rp|311}}

==Judgment==
The Supreme Court decided that, in this case, the proximity of the questionable hiring statistics to the application of Title VII to public employers was very relevant. The primary reason for the ultimate decision of the Court was that "pre-Act" hiring practices, that were perfectly legal under Title VII until the 1972 amendment, might have caused the statistical disparities in question.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt;{{rp|310}} Based on that fact and the warning in the recent ''[[Teamsters v. United States|Teamsters]]'' decision that, when considering statistics as evidence of discrimination, all of the facts must be carefully considered,&lt;ref name="case" /&gt;{{rp|312}} the Court vacated the decision of the Court of Appeals and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings, instructing them to consider whether the pre-Act practices might have played a predominant role in the statistics.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt;{{rp|313}}

==Significance==
This case solidified the decision in ''[[Teamsters v. United States]]'', where the Court decided that statistics could play a leading role in showing a ''[[prima facie]]'' case of discrimination under Title VII, but that they must be used with great care. The ''Teamsters'' decision was very important in the evolution of [[disparate Impact]] jurisprudence, and made it much easier for the victims of discrimination to bring cases against their employers. ''Hazelwood'' somewhat weakened that decision, however, by noting that statistics which were caused by actions taken legally, before the application of anti-discrimination laws, could not be used in such a way, and that an employer must be given a chance to prove that that might be the case, before a ''prima facie'' case can be said to have been established.

'''Independent Venetians''' ({{lang-it|Veneti Indipendenti}}, '''VI''') is a [[Venetian nationalism|Venetist]] and [[separatism|separatist]] [[List of political parties in Veneto|political party]] active in [[Veneto]].

==History==
VI emerged in February 2014 as a split from [[Venetian Independence]] (IV),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lintraprendente.it/2014/02/e-salvini-fece-sua-la-lotta-per-lindipendenza-veneta/&lt;/ref&gt; the most established separatist party in Veneto at the time. After an internal struggle and a congress, during which his role of president was cancelled from the party's constitution,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnveneto.org/2014/01/rottura-tra-morosin-e-cantarutti-vittoria-di-pirro-per-lavvocato-di-noale/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lindipendenza.com/indipendenza-veneta-si-spacca-polemiche-fra-cantarutti-e-morosin/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lindipendenza.com/la-maledizione-degli-indipendentisti-veneti-ancora-una-rottura/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luca Azzano Cantarutti]] had left the party in January, after a power struggle with [[Alessio Morosin]].

Since its formation, the party tried to join forces with other alike parties and groups, except IV. Chiefly, Azzano Cantarutti and VI were instrumental in the foundation of "United for Independent Veneto", along with [[Veneto State]] (VS), [[Liga Veneta Repubblica]] (LVR) and [[Popular Future]] (FP), in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/pageContainer.jsp?p=84&amp;n=81&amp;c=5&amp;e=91&amp;t=0&amp;idEvento=6494&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/politica/11561958/Autonomie--Movimenti-presentano--Uniti.html&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition was transformed into "We Independent Veneto" (NVI), after the entry of other parties, notably including [[North-East Project]] (PNE) and [[Chiavegato for Independence]], in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://ligavenetarepubblica.org/360/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.noivenetoindipendente.org/chisiamo/&lt;/ref&gt;

After the exit of Chiavegato and his group from the alliance&lt;ref&gt;http://www.noivenetoindipendente.org/wordpress/comunicato-di-noi-veneto-indipendente/&lt;/ref&gt; and their alignment with Morosin's IV,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miglioverde.eu/veneto-chiavegato-e-morosin-si-accordano-in-vista-delle-regionali/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.larena.it/stories/2594_caldiero/1111298_morosin_via_da_questa_italia_e_un_veneto_libero_in_europa/&lt;/ref&gt; the remaining parties of NVI formed a joint list for the [[Venetian regional election, 2015|2015 regional election]] named [[Independence We Veneto]] (INV), a sort of re-edition of [[Venetian regional election, 2010|2010]]'s [[North-East Union]], but with a separatist platform and in support of [[Luca Zaia]], incumbent [[President of Veneto]] and candidate of [[Liga Veneta]]–[[Lega Nord]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilgazzettino.it/NORDEST/TREVISO/elezioni_regione_veneto_zaia_comencini_foggiato/notizie/1312771.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.venetouno.it/notizia/44153/comencini-e-foggiato-ancora-insieme-a-luca-zaia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miglioverde.eu/noi-veneto-indipendente-ufficializza-lalleanza-con-zaia/&lt;/ref&gt; In the election, the list won 2.7% of the vote (0.2% more than IV) and [[Antonio Guadagnini]] of VS was elected regional councillor in the provincial constituency of [[province of Vicenza|Vicenza]],&lt;ref&gt;http://ricerca.gelocal.it/tribunatreviso/archivio/tribunatreviso/2015/06/28/treviso-indipendenza-i-veneti-diranno-la-loro-11.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vivereveneto.com/2015/07/02/consiglieri-regionali-e-referendum-veneto/&lt;/ref&gt; thus becoming INV's practical leader.

However, after Guadagnini's exit from INV and his launch of [[We Are Veneto]] (SV),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.noivenetoindipendente.org/wordpress/comunicato-stampa-3/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/veneto/notizie/politica/2016/2-aprile-2016/venetisti-contro-ribelle-ha-firmato-patto-paghi-200-mila-euro-240254175954.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Azzano Cantarutti led VI and INV into an alliance with [[Great North]] (GN).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.affaritaliani.it/milano/partiti-costitutito-movimento-grande-nord-486161.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lindipendenzanuova.com/e-nato-grande-nord-con-bernardelli-bossi-se-non-serve-piu-la-lega-puo-anche-chiudere&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Internationalist League of Norway''' ({{lang-no|Forbundet Internasjonalen i Noreg}} (FIN) is a group of revolutionary socialists, set up in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leftist Parties of Norway|url=http://www.broadleft.org/no.htm|publisher=Broad Left|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; working in sympathy with the [[Reunified Fourth International|Fourth International]]. Until 2002 FIN worked as a current within the [[Red Electoral Alliance]] advocating that the Red Electoral Alliance should be a broad party for revolutionaries on Norway, based on internationalism, anti-stalinism and internal democracy. Since 2002 FIN operates both within the Red Electoral Alliance and the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]].

The term '''Jewish lobby''' is used to describe organized [[lobbying]] attributed to [[Jews]] on domestic and foreign policy decisions, as a political participant of representative government, conducted predominantly in the [[Jewish diaspora]] in a number of [[Western world|Western]] countries. While at times self-described,&lt;ref name=Vidal&gt;Vidal, Dominique.

==Descriptions==
In his ''Dictionary of Politics'' (1992), [[Walter John Raymond]] describes the term "Jewish Lobby" as "A conglomeration of approximately thirty-four Jewish political organizations in the [[United States]] which make joint and separate efforts to lobby for their interests in the United States, as well as for the interests of the State of [[Israel]]." He also notes that "[a]mong those organizations which are most actively involved in lobbying activities at federal, state and local levels of political and governmental institutions are: the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] (AIPAC), the [[American Jewish Committee]]... and the [[B'nai B'rith]]."&lt;ref name=Raymond&gt;[[Walter John Raymond|Raymond, Walter John]]. ''The Dictionary of Politics: Selected American and Foreign Political and Legal Terms'', [[Brunswick Publishing Corporation]], 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=1dtn0olA8PcC&amp;pg=PA254 p. 254.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:fr:Dominique Vidal|Dominique Vidal]], writing in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', states that in the United States the term is "self-described" and it "is only one of many influence groups that have official standing with institutions and authorities."&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt;

The [[B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission of Australia]] states in its description, "It is important to recognise that lobbies are natural parts of pluralist, democratic societies such as Australia. Lobbying constitutes a mainstream method of influencing government policy, as a means of enhancing representative government. As such, just as other communities and interest groups have lobbies, there is a 'Jewish lobby' – an unwieldy group of individuals and organisations devoted to supporting the needs and interests of the Jewish community.  This Jewish lobby is a player in representative government, and its very existence confirms the ordinary place Jews have within Australian politics. The assumption, however, that Jews have a disproportionate power and influence over decision making is what transforms a descriptive reality about politics to an antisemitic argument about Jewish power."&lt;ref name=BnaiBrithAusMediaStereo/&gt;

Noting the high voting rate of individual [[American Jews]] in elections, [[J.J. Goldberg]], editorial director of ''[[The Forward]]'', stated in a 2004 speech that "The Jewish lobby... is actually more than just a dozen organizations. The [[Anti-Defamation League]], the [[American Jewish Committee]], [[Hadassah]], of course, AIPAC, but it is also the impact of the Jewish role. ... So, the Jewish influence is a lot of things.  It is the organizations, it's the vote, it's fundraising."&lt;ref name="GoldbergLawac"/&gt;

==Criticism of the term==

===Viewed as inaccurate===
[[Mitchell Bard]], director of the non-profit [[Jewish Virtual Library]], writes that: "Reference is often made to the 'Jewish lobby' in an effort to describe Jewish influence, but this term is both vague and inadequate. While it is true that American Jews are sometimes represented by lobbyists, such direct efforts to influence policy-makers are but a small part of the lobby's ability to shape policy."&lt;ref name="BardLobby"&gt;[[Mitchell Bard]], [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/lobby.html The Israeli and Arab Lobbies], [[Jewish Virtual Library]]. Accessed February 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Bard argues the term Israel lobby is more accurate, because it comprises both formal and informal elements (which includes public opinion), and "...because a large proportion of the lobby is made up of non-Jews."&lt;ref name=Bard&gt;[[Mitchell Bard|Bard, Mitchell]]. ''The Water's Edge and Beyond: Defining the Limits to Domestic Influence on United States Middle East Policy'', [[Transaction Publishers]], 1991, p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-88738-346-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1987 work, ''The Lobby: Jewish Political Power and American Foreign Policy'', [[Edward Tivnan]] states that the term "needed some fine-tuning; what was most at issue... was the influence of the 'pro-Israel lobby.'"&lt;ref&gt;Tivnan, Edward. ''The Lobby: Jewish Political Power and American Foreign Policy''. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1987, p. 10. {{ISBN|0-671-50153-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the editor of the ''[[New York Times Sunday Review of Books]]'', responding to a review by Leslie Gelb of their 2007 book ''[[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Gelb, Leslie H. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/books/review/Gelb-t.html?pagewanted=print "Dual Loyalties"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[University of Chicago]] professor [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Harvard University]] professor [[Stephen Walt]] write: "Gelb refers repeatedly to a 'Jewish lobby,' despite the fact that we never employ the term in our book. Indeed, we explicitly rejected this label as inaccurate and misleading, both because the lobby includes non-Jews like the [[Christian Zionist]]s and because many Jewish Americans do not support the hard-line policies favored by its most powerful elements."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Mearsheimer|Mearsheimer, John]]; [[Stephen Walt|Walt, Stephen]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/books/review/Letters-t-1.html?ref=review "The Israel lobby"], letters to the editor, ''[[New York Times Sunday Review of Books]]'', October 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous week, in a live Q&amp;A session at ''[[The Washington Post]]'', they stated they themselves "never use the term 'Jewish lobby' because the lobby is defined by its political agenda, not by religion or ethnicity."&lt;ref name="MearsheimerWalt"&gt;[[John Mearsheimer|Mearsheimer, John]]; [[Stephen Walt|Walt, Stephen]]. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/10/05/DI2007100501306.html "The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', Book World Live, October 9, 2007. Accessed March 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viewed as antisemitic and/or pejorative===
[[Robert S. Wistrich]], of the International Center for the Study of Antisemitism, [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], sees reference to the phrase, when used to describe an "[[Shadow government (conspiracy)|all-powerful]] 'Jewish Lobby' that prevents justice in the Middle East", as reliance on a classic antisemitic stereotype.&lt;ref name="Klug/Wistrich"&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]] &amp; [[Robert S. Wistrich|Wistrich, Robert S.]] [http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/klug.html "Correspondence between Prof. Robert Wistrich and Brian Klug: When Is Opposition to Israel and Its Policies Anti-Semitic?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910045836/http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/klug.html |date=2006-09-10 }}, International Center for the Study of Antisemitism, [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Retrieved January 11, 2008: "Does he or she rely on classic anti-Semitic stereotypes in so doing: for example, by dredging up the alleged Jewish/Zionist 'conspiracy' to dominate the world, or by evoking Jewish/Israeli 'warmongers' who supposedly run American foreign policy; or through referring to an all-powerful "Jewish Lobby" that prevents justice in the Middle East."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruno Bettelheim]] detested the term, arguing "The self-importance of Jews combined with the paranoia of the anti-Semite had created the image of this lobby."&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Nina (David Sharp trans.) ''Bettelheim: A Life and a Legacy'', [[Basic Books]], 1996, p. 486. {{ISBN|978-0-465-00635-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Lasky describes the term as an "unfortunate phrase", and "imagines" that [[Alexander Walker (critic)|Alexander Walker]]'s use of it while writing about the [[Nazism and cinema|Nazi films]] of [[Leni Riefenstahl]] was not intended pejoratively.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky, Melvin J. ''Media Warfare: The Americanization of Language'', [[Transaction Publishers]], 2005, p. 147. {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission of Australia states that "the stereotype of the 'Jewish lobby' is that the Jewish engagement in politics and policy debate is above and beyond the ordinary participation of a group in public policy-making. It paints Jewish involvement as surreptitious, and as subverting the democratic process. It alleges that a 'Jewish lobby', through bribery, bullying and manipulation, pressures politicians to act against their will and duties."&lt;ref name=ADC-Australia&gt;[http://www.antidef.org.au/www/309/1001127/displayarticle/1001412.html The 'Jewish Lobby'], B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission (Australia). Accessed March 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Visontay, editor of [[Australia]]'s ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', wrote in 2003 that "The way the phrase 'Jewish lobby' has been bandied about in numerous letters implies there is something inherently sinister in lobbying when Jews do it."&lt;ref&gt;Visontay, Michael. [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/11/13/1068674320037.html "Free speech for some, others pay"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', November 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Geoffrey Brahm Levey and Philip Mendes, the term is used in Australia as a pejorative description of the way in which the Jewish community influences the Liberal Party "by talking to its leaders and making them aware of Jewish wishes and views".&lt;ref&gt;Levey, Geoffrey Brahm; Mendes, Philip. ''Jews and Australian Politics'', [[Sussex Academic Press]], 2004, p. 91. {{ISBN|978-1-903900-72-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dominique Schnapper]], [[Chantal Bordes-Benayoun]] and [[Freddy Raphaėl]] write that following the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the term "began to be heard in political life" in [[France]].&lt;ref name=Schnapper2010p3&gt;Dominique Schnapper, Chantal Bordes-Benayoun, Freddy Raphaėl. ''Jewish Citizenship in France: The Temptation of Being Among One's Own'', [[Transaction Publishers]], 2010, p. 3. {{ISBN|978-1-4128-1474-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vidal writes that the term has been used there exclusively by the French [[far right]] as "a phrase that combines standard anti-semitic fantasies about Jewish finance, media control and power; the term is the contemporary equivalent of [[the Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]".&lt;ref name=Vidal/&gt; [[Loyola University Chicago]] professor Wiley Feinstein wrote in 2003 that "there is much talk of the 'Jewish lobby' in the Italian Press and in Europe", describing the term as "a phrase[] of scorn for Jews and Judaism".&lt;ref name=Feinstein2003p369&gt;Feinstein, Wiley. ''The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy: Poets, Artists, Saints, Anti-Semites'', [[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]], 2003, p. 369. {{ISBN|978-0-8386-3988-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Safire]] wrote in 1993 that in the [[United Kingdom]] "Jewish lobby" is used as an "even more pejorative" term for "the 'Israel lobby'".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire|Safire, William]]. ''Safire's New Political Dictionary: The Definitive Guide to the New Language'', Random House, 1993, p. 120. {{ISBN|978-0-679-42068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Jacobs of [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] writes that the phrase "Jewish lobby", when used "without mentioning other 'lobbies' or differentiating Jews who have different political positions on a number of questions, including Israel and Palestine", is a contemporary form of the fear of a [[Jewish conspiracy]].&lt;ref name=Jacobs2005&gt;Jacobs, Dr. Susan. [http://www.surrey.ac.uk/Arts/CRONEM/Conference-2005-papers/SusanJacobs.doc "''AntiSemitism and other forms of racism'' Continuities, discontinuities, (and some conspiracies….)"] Paper presented at the 2005 CRONEM (Centre for Research on Nationalism, Ethnicity and Multiculturalism) Conference, [[Roehampton University]], Southlands College, 14th-15th June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defense of the term==
In a 2004 speech, Goldberg said, "There has been an awful lot of talk in the last few years about the rise of the Jewish lobby and the influence of the Jewish lobby. It used to be that you couldn't talk about this sort of thing.  When I wrote [the book] ''Jewish Power'' in 1996... I was accused by various Jewish lobbyists of inflating and buying into the old myths of international Jewish conspiracies simply by the use of the title."&lt;ref name="GoldbergLawac"/&gt; Goldberg disagrees with the sensitivity towards the use of the term, arguing that: "There is such a thing as a Jewish lobby, that the network of organizations that works together to put across what might be called the Jewish community's view on world affairs is not insignificant, it's not an invention, but it is not some sort of all-powerful octopus that it's sometimes portrayed as these days."&lt;ref name="GoldbergLawac"/&gt; Mearsheimer and Walt wrote in 2006 that "even the [[Media of Israel|Israeli media]] refer to America's 'Jewish Lobby'",&lt;ref name="LRB"&gt;[[John Mearsheimer|Mearsheimer, John]] and [[Stephen Walt|Walt, Stephen]]. [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n06/mear01_.html "The Israel Lobby''], ''[[London Review of Books]]'', March 23, 2006. Accessed March 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and stated the following year that "AIPAC and the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations|Conference of Presidents]] and the Israeli media themselves refer to America's 'Jewish Lobby'."&lt;ref name=W&amp;M-p188&gt;[[John Mearsheimer|Mearsheimer, John]] and [[Stephen Walt|Walt, Stephen]]. ''The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy,'' Farrah, Strauss and Giroux, 2007, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction to the term's use==
After South African activist, Christian cleric, and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Desmond Tutu]] used it in a 1985 speech at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], a supporter wrote him privately urging him to avoid the phrase, stating it was "language... normally associated with the less than philo-Semitic elements of our acquaintance".&lt;ref&gt;Allen, John. ''Rabble-Rouser for Peace: The Authorized Biography of Desmond Tutu'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2006, p. 385. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-6937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tutu used the phrase again in a 2002 editorial in ''[[The Guardian]]'', stating "People are scared in this country [the US], to say wrong is wrong because the Jewish lobby is powerful – very powerful. Well, so what? For goodness sake, this is God's world!"&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond Tutu|Tutu, Desmond]]. [https://www.theguardian.com/israel/comment/0,10551,706911,00.html "Apartheid in the Holy Land"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', April 29, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This use was criticized by [[Melanie Phillips]] of the ''[[Daily Mail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Melanie Phillips|Phillips, Melanie]]. "Bigotry and a corruption of the truth", ''[[Daily Mail]]'', May 6, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; When he edited and reprinted parts of his speech in 2005, Tutu replaced the words "Jewish lobby" with "pro-Israeli lobby".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, Michael P; Aruri, Naseer Hasan.

[[Chris Davies (Liberal Democrat politician)|Chris Davies]], [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] for the northwest of England was forced to resign in 2006 as leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] group in the European Parliament after writing to a constituent "I shall denounce the influence of the Jewish lobby that seems to have far too great a say over the political decision-making process in many countries."&lt;ref name=Hirsh2006&gt;Hirsh, David.

A 2007 editorial in ''[[The New York Sun]]'' accused [[Richard Dawkins]], a British [[evolutionary biologist]] and [[writer]], of repeating antisemitic conspiracy theories after he used the term in an interview published in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=Johnson2007&gt;[[Daniel Johnson (journalist)|Johnson, Daniel]].

In his book ''Jewish Power'', Goldberg writes that in the United States the "Jewish lobby" for decades played a leadership role in formulating American policy on issues such as civil rights, separation of church and state, and immigration, guided by a liberalism that was a complex mixture of Jewish tradition, the experience of persecution, and self-interest. It was thrust into prominence following the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]]'s sharp shift of American policy towards significant military and foreign aid support for Israel following the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[J.J.

Silver became the new leader of American Zionism, with his call for "loud diplomacy", and he then "cranked up the [[Zionist Organization of America]]'s one-man lobbying operation in Washington—renaming it the American Zionist Emergency Council (AZEC)—and began to mobilize American Jewry into a mass movement."&lt;ref name=Tivnan1987pp23-24&gt;Tivnan, Edward .

Former ''New York Times'' journalist Youssef Ibrahim writes: "That there is a Jewish lobby in America concerned with the well-being of Israel is a silly question. It is insane to ask whether the 6 million American Jews should be concerned about the 6 million Israeli Jews, particularly in view of the massacre of another 6 million Jews in the Holocaust. It's elementary, my dear Watson: Any people who do not care for their own are not worthy of concern. And what the Israel lobby does is what all ethnic lobbies — Greek, Armenian, Latvian, Irish, [[Cuban-American lobby|Cuban]], and others — do in this democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim, Youssef.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3699">'''Jochum de Lange''' was the leader of ''Strilekrigen'', an 18th-century farmer's [[rebellion]], in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]]. He led several thousand men to protest against the high taxes which were imposed on the poor farmers and fishermen of Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/strilekrigen|title=strilekrigen|author=Magnus A. Mardal|work=Store norske leksikon|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Jochum de Lange was a former sailor who settled down as a farmer on the island of [[Flatøy]], [[Norway]]. He was said to be a charismatic man, who was married three times, and who easily gained other peoples trust. He was a visionary and a man of experience, but adventurous with a longing to return to the sea. Jochum de Lange would die in a Bergen prison.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.c2i.net/jenlen/innvandring/sudmann-slekten/deutsch/flatoy_1833.html ''Bauernaufstandes 1765'' (Flatøy 1833)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strilekrigen==
In autumn 1762, the national government in [[Copenhagen]] established an extra per capita tax for every person over twelve years, which was later reduced to a charge per household. These extra taxes were intended to help pay loans from foreign governments and to support the price of the [[Danish-Norwegian]] currency at the stock market in [[Hamburg]].

Strilekrigen took place in Bergen on 18 April 1765, when about 2,000 common people from [[Nordhordland]] poured into Bergen to protest against the harsh action of the extra tax. The extra tax had hit the poor farmers and fishermen in rural areas around Bergen particularly hard. The protests, which became violent, were particularly directed at [[Ulrik Fredrik de Cicignon]] (1698–1772), the local sheriff (''stiftamtmann'') .

Rebellions of this magnitude was unprecedented in the 18th century, and officials in Copenhagen were appalled. The authorities send an inquiry north consisting of top officials on a warship. The leaders of the rebellion were indicted by the general court and were convicted of disturbance of public order. The result was that a few farmers ended in prison for life after being pardoned from the death sentence. The extra tax was later abolished in Norway in 1772 but continued in force in Denmark. Ulrik Fredrik de Cicignon sought and received dismissal in May 1766. He moved to [[Sønderborg]] in the [[Duchy of Schleswig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Ulrik_Frederik_De_Cicignon/utdypning|title=Ulrik Fredrik de Cicignon|author=Harald Nissen d.e.|work=Store norske leksikon|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leksikon.org/art.php?n=2468|title=Strilekrigen|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Olav Flatøy, a businessman and writer from Flatøy, wrote a novel concerning life on Flatøy in the mid-18th century. It was called ''Anne Cathrine'', and told the story of Jocum de Lange, his third wife and her struggles after his death. This novel was printed as a serial in [[Bergens Tidende]] in 1961.

In 2013 the music festival [[Flatøy Rock]] introduced Jochum de Lange as the mascot and theme for the festival. This was done in an effort to raise awareness to the history and heritage of the people in Nordhordland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordhordland.no/puls/article6762719.ece|title=Avisa Nordhordland - Med actionfigurar og eksklusive gitarar|author=Yngve Garen Svardal|work=www.nordhordland.no|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily a wholesaler of water to cities and improvement districts within [[Salt Lake County]], [http://www.jvwcd.org '''Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District'''] is a political subdivision of the State of [[Utah]] and one of the largest [[water district]]s in the state. It was created in 1951 under the Water Conservancy District Act and was called Salt Lake County Water Conservancy District until 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE73/htm/73_10_003200.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803000428/http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE73/htm/73_10_003200.htm |archivedate=2010-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jordan Valley Water is the largest petitioner of the [[Central Utah Project]], a Federal water project which will annually provide up to {{convert|71,400|acre.ft|m3}} of water to Jordan Valley Water by 2021.

Jordan Valley Water is governed by a board of nine Trustees who represent eight geographical divisions. They are nominated either by the Salt Lake County Council or a city council, depending upon the division they represent. The Governor then appoints Trustees for a four-year term from those nominated.

Jordan Valley Water has a retail service area primarily in unincorporated areas of [[Salt Lake County]], making up about ten percent of its deliveries. Approximately ninety percent of its municipal water is delivered on a wholesale basis to cities and water districts. In addition, Jordan Valley Water treats and delivers water to Metropolitan Water District of Salt Lake &amp; [[Sandy, Utah|Sandy]] on a contractual basis for delivery to [[Salt Lake City]] and Sandy City, even though neither city is within Jordan Valley Water's service boundaries. Jordan Valley Water also delivers untreated water to irrigators in Salt Lake and Utah Counties to meet commitments under irrigation exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jvwcd.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water conservation issues==
Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District is responsible to plan for long-term facilities and monitor water use to ensure that a sustainable supply of water will be available for the 600,000+ residents within its service area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slcgov.com/utilities/NewsEvents/news2000/news05012000.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that Utah is the second-driest State in the nation, this presents some unique challenges.&lt;ref&gt;http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/the_land/physicalgeographyofutah.html&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, Utahns use more water per capita than residents of other states, with the exception of Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utahfoundation.org/reports/?page_id%3D331 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719210140/http://www.utahfoundation.org/reports/?page_id=331 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a limited number of potential new sources of water which can be developed; however, doing so will be expensive both financially and environmentally.&lt;ref&gt;http://utahweather.org/on_the_water_front.html&lt;/ref&gt; With a goal of reducing water use 25 percent by 2025, Jordan Valley Water launched a major conservation campaign in 1999 in the hopes of extending water supplies for future generations without having to pursue as many new sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700241433/Conservation-programs-target-water-use.html&lt;/ref&gt;

With approximately 65 percent of culinary water used on outdoor landscaping,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joe.org/joe/2009april/rb5.php&lt;/ref&gt; it was decided that outdoor water would be the place to begin: educate the public about more efficient ways to water their landscapes, and to teach them that water-efficient landscaping can be beautiful.

In 1999, Jordan Valley Water developed the conservation education campaign "Slow The Flow, Save H2O" as a major component of its water conservation efforts.  The campaign was successful, spread statewide, and has been adopted by every major water district in Utah.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slowtheflow.org/campaign/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Jordan Valley Water began developing waterwise demonstration gardens at its headquarters site.  The gardens have seen a number of expansions since then and now comprise nearly five acres of display gardens called Conservation Garden Park. A new LEED Platinum-designed Education Center was opened to the public in 2013.  This center furthers opportunities for outreach and education.

Hopkins has been accused of [[racism]] by journalists, [[advocacy group]]s and politicians for her comments about [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|migrants]].

Hopkins told [[Sathnam Sanghera]] of ''[[The Times]]'' in June 2015 that she applied to study [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE) at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. She passed the [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] entrance exam, but was rejected at the interview stage.&lt;ref name="Sanghera"/&gt; Disappointed, and putting the failure down to an absence of "a bit of coaching", she instead studied economics at the [[University of Exeter]]. She felt that her time at university was "redeemed" by her sponsorship from the [[British Army]]'s [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]], and spent her weekends with the [[Officers' Training Corps]].&lt;ref name="Sanghera"/&gt; This she found "really fun, lying around in forests with guns having a brilliant time".&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"/&gt;

She completed her military training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], but suffered an [[epilepsy|epileptic seizure]] during the final [[Passing out (military)|passing-out]] ceremony, and as a result was unable to take up her commission.&lt;ref name="Sanghera"/&gt; Hopkins said she kept her epilepsy secret whilst attending Sandhurst as this would have prevented her from being commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Katie Hopkins talking about her epilepsy|url=https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/news/katie-hopkins-talking-about-her-epilepsy|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=Epilepsy Today|date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, she joined a business consultancy and moved to [[Manhattan]], New York City, before returning to the UK in 2005.&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"/&gt; She joined the [[Met Office]] as a global brand consultant in September 2006.&lt;ref name=bbcmet/&gt;

====Aftermath====
In June 2007, Hopkins lost her job at the Met Office, which said that she did not meet the required standards to complete her probationary period, and confirmed that her performance on ''The Apprentice'' and confessions about her private life were a factor in her dismissal.&lt;ref name="bbcmet" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0612/theapprentice.html |title=Katie Hopkins fired from real job |accessdate=15 June 2007 |publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929155515/http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0612/theapprentice.html |archivedate=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins later stated that the media were informed of her dismissal an hour after she was fired.&lt;ref name='GMTV'/&gt; After her appearance on ''The Apprentice'', Hopkins signed two deals to sell her story, one with the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper and the other with [[EMAP]], the company behind ''[[heat (magazine)|Heat]]'' and ''[[Grazia]]'' magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,2097757,00.html|title=Apprentice star signs News of the World deal|accessdate=15 June 2007|work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood | date=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins said in an interview with [[BBC Radio Kent]] that she had great respect for Sugar, and that she believed she would have won the programme had she been in the final episode. She also said that the media's attitudes towards her did not affect her but did affect her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/realmedia/audio/kents_best/thursday.ram|title=Katie Hopkins BBC Radio Kent Interview |accessdate=15 June 2007|publisher=BBC Radio Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made a similar claim of hypothetical victory in an interview with Fiona Phillips on the morning of the final ''Apprentice'' episode, although Sugar had said that if she wanted to press on he would fire her, whoever she was competing with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Katie Hopkins Interview|series=[[GMTV]]|station=[[ITV1]]|airdate=13 June 2007|season=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins told [[BBC Radio 1]] that she had not yet ruled out a media career&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/check/player/nol/newsid_6740000/newsid_6746800?redirect=6746827.stm&amp;news=1&amp;bbram=1&amp;bbwm=1&amp;nbram=1&amp;nbwm=1&amp;prefs=1 |title=Radio 1 Newsbeat – Katie Hopkins Interview |accessdate=15 June 2007 |publisher=BBC Radio 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but expressed interest in starting a business venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2007/06/13/katie_hopkins_apprentice_feature.shtml |title=What Katie did next... |accessdate=14 June 2007|publisher=BBC Berkshire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcasting work===
After ''The Apprentice'', Hopkins appeared in an episode of ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]'', and was a guest star on ''[[Loose Women]]'' and ''[[The Friday Night Project]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geo.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/F/fnp/episodes/s5_ep4.html|title=Show Four: Melanie C |accessdate=7 August 2007|publisher=Channel 4}}{{dead link|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, she presented a ''Five Live Report'' on family life and working mothers for [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], and contributed an article on the same subject to [[BBC Online]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Hopkins |title=Gateway to the world feels just like a parish hall |url=http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=136993&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=244961&amp;contentPK=17892541&amp;folderPk=113914&amp;pNodeId=244962 |publisher=Express and Echo |page=1 |date=21 July 2007 |accessdate=30 July 2007 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins has appeared twice on ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' in the editions of 10 June 2010 and 27 January 2011.

In 2015, she deliberately gained and lost weight over the course of several months, in an attempt to show that obese people can diet successfully.

Later that year, she began her own chat show, ''[[If Katie Hopkins Ruled the World]]'' on the digital channel [[TLC (UK and Ireland)|TLC]]. She said she wanted to bring a new variation to chat and panel shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/06/if-katie-hopkins-ruled-the-world-tv-show-daily-mail-liz-jones|title=Katie Hopkins' TV show: 'I’m not playing the part of a pantomime villain’|first=Tara|last=Conlan|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 August 2015|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was dropped in December, after the first series, owing to low audience ratings.&lt;ref name="Sweney181215"/&gt;

Hopkins said she is "pushing back the walls closing in on freedom of speech" at a Church and Media conference in October 2015. Claiming to be "the new Jesus" during her speech, she said: "I have never apologised for anything I’ve said. I find it very disappointing when people apologise.

===Print and websites===
Early in her public career, Hopkins wrote a column for Exeter's ''[[Express &amp; Echo]]'' newspaper, but her articles ceased after an online poll in October 2007 found 84% of readers wanted the feature to end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/7037846.stm|title=Apprentice Katie is 'fired' again|publisher=BBC News|date=10 October 2007|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of October 2013, it emerged that Hopkins had joined ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' as a weekly columnist.&lt;ref name="Guardian311013"/&gt; with the newspaper promoting her as "Britain's most controversial columnist".&lt;ref name="Dearden010815"/&gt; Hopkins in February 2015 defended her remarks and those of her critics, commenting: "I welcome it because I've had my opinion and it's only right that people have theirs. I welcome the debate and the fact that people are getting involved."&lt;ref name=Lockhart/&gt;

She left ''The Sun'' for the [[Mail Online]] website, the online companion to the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in autumn 2015.&lt;ref name="Sweney240915"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/24/katie-hopkins-leaves-the-sun-to-join-mail-online|title=Katie Hopkins leaves the Sun to join Mail Online|work=The Guardian|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' contributor [[Bryony Gordon]] wrote in April 2015 that media organisations have "a tipping point here, where the marketing men and women don't want to be associated with reality TV's very own Adolf Hitler.

A few days before, a video was posted online of Hopkins' appearance at the [[David Horowitz Freedom Center]] in Florida earlier in November 2017. "It's such a pleasure to be amongst people that are prepared to fight for their country" she said, asserting it is "our time".

==Controversies==

Since ''The Apprentice'', Hopkins has frequently featured in the media for making controversial remarks, being described in several media outlets as a "professional [[internet troll|troll]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/19/friday-2-januarys-best-tv|title=Friday 2nd January's Best TV|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 December 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/02/katie-hopkins-gets-slayed-twitter-x-factor-stereo-kicks-singer-tom-mann_n_6253542.html|title=Katie Hopkins Gets Slayed on Twitter By X Factor Stereo Kicks Singer Tom Mann|work=HuffPost|date=2 December 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/stereo-kicks/news/stereo-kicks-burn-katie-hopkins-on-twitter|title=Stereo Kicks Burn Katie Hopkins on Twitter|publisher=MTV|date=2 December 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described herself as a "conduit for truth", declaring what other people think but are too scared to say.&lt;ref name="Usborne2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Usborne|first=Simon|title=A day with Katie Hopkins: Separating the Apprentice 'superbitch' from her soundbites|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/a-day-with-katie-hopkins-separating-the-apprentice-superbitch-from-her-soundbites-8706555.html|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=Independent|date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social class===
During an appearance on [[ITV Network|ITV's]] ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'' in July 2013, Hopkins revealed she would stop her children playing with their classmates based on their [[given name]]s. She revealed a particular dislike for "lower class" names like Charmaine, Chantelle, and [[Chardonnay (name)|Chardonnay]], which met with disapproval from co-host [[Holly Willoughby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallwork|first=Ellen|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/09/30/holly-willoughby-baby-name-katie-hopkins-teases-they-clearly-had-sex-in-chester_n_7321976.html|title=Holly Willoughby Baby Name: Katie Hopkins Teases 'They Clearly Had Sex In Chester'|work=HuffPost|date=30 September 2014|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins said that she did not like "geographical location names" either. After Willoughby's colleague, [[Phillip Schofield]], pointed out that she had given the name [[India (given name)|India]] to one of her daughters, Hopkins asserted that India is "not related to a place".&lt;ref name="Battersby"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/katie-hopkins-branded-an-insufferable-snob-after-this-morning-debate-on-childrens-names-8690468.html|title=Katie Hopkins branded an 'insufferable snob' after This Morning debate on children's names|first=Matilda|last=Battersby|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=9 July 2013|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A viewers' poll conducted by the ''This Morning'' programme indicated that 91% of respondents disagreed with Hopkins' opinion.&lt;ref name="Battersby"/&gt;

Appearing as a panellist on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s ''[[The Big Benefits Row: Live]]'' in February 2014, she was accused by [[Terry Christian]] amongst others of only expressing her controversial opinions to make money from media appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/02/04/katie-hopkins-annabel-giles-the-big-benefits-row-channel-5_n_4721468.html|title=Katie Hopkins Comes To Blows With Annabel Giles On 'The Big Benefits Row'|work=Huffington Post|date=4 February 2014|first=Ashley|last=Percival|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins has said that financial motives are not the reason she speaks out, and received a "relatively modest" fee of £300 when she was on ''This Morning'' speaking about children's names.&lt;ref name="Usborne2014"/&gt;

In a February 2014 interview with [[Decca Aitkenhead]] for ''The Guardian'', Hopkins was asked if she is a snob: "Oh, definitely yeah, 100%. I think it's really important to be snobby".&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"/&gt;

===Illness and fatalities in the UK===
Hopkins posted a tweet referring to Scottish [[life expectancy]] predictions based upon a 2011 [[NHS Scotland]] report, "Healthy Life Expectancy in Scotland: Update of trends to 2010". This tweet was posted following a heated debate on Scottish Independence during an edition of  ''[[The Wright Stuff]]'' on which Hopkins was a panellist. In the wake of the [[2013 Glasgow helicopter crash]], the tweet raised widespread condemnation among Twitter users. Hopkins retorted "Following Independence I will only be the Biggest Bitch in England", and described people's reactions as "[[political correctness|PC]] tastic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/02/katie-hopkins-twitter-glasgow-helicopter-crash-apprentice|title=Katie Hopkins apologises for timing of tweet about Scottish life expectancy|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 December 2013|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition to ban Hopkins from shows such as ITV's ''This Morning'' and ''The Wright Stuff'' on Channel 5 gained over 75,000 signatures. Hopkins issued an apology the following Monday, restating that her original remark was in reference to the NHS report and was simply bad timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baird|first=Dugald|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/03/katie-hopkins-petition-scotland-glasgow-twitter|title=Katie Hopkins petition passes 75,000 as she explains life expectancy tweet|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 December 2013|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ITV said on 5 December 2013 that "We have no plans for Katie Hopkins to appear on ''This Morning'' at this present time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blundy|first=Rachel|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/celebritynews/katie-hopkins-dropped-from-this-morning-after-thousands-sign-petition-in-wake-of-ill-timed-scotland-8983264.html|title=Katie Hopkins 'dropped' from This Morning after thousands sign petition in wake of ill-timed Scotland tweet|work=London Evening Standard|date=5 December 2013|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 2014, police announced they were investigating complaints they had received concerning Hopkins' tweets about [[Ebola virus disease in the United Kingdom#2014 returning aid worker|Pauline Cafferkey]], a Scottish aid worker who was diagnosed with [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] after returning to the UK from [[Sierra Leone]]. Hopkins had tweeted: "Little sweaty jocks, sending us Ebola bombs in the form of sweaty Glaswegians just isn't cricket.

Her comments were condemned by leading UK Alzheimer's charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11520748/Katie-Hopkins-slurs-on-dementia-patients-provoke-anger-from-charities.html|title = Katie Hopkins' slurs on dementia patients provoke anger from charities|last = Donnelly|first = Laura|date = 7 April 2015|work = The Daily Telegraph|access-date = 8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After five Londoners drowned at [[Camber Sands]] in August 2016, Hopkins tweeted a poll mocking the identities of the deceased.&lt;ref name="Blair250816"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/katie-hopkins-twitter-camber-sands-death-poll-police-report-a7209081.html|title=Katie Hopkins reported to Twitter by police over Camber Sands deaths poll|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Olivia|last=Blair|date=25 August 2016|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sussex Police]] reported the tweet to Twitter under the headings of "abusive or harmful" and "disrespectful or offensive".&lt;ref name="Blair250816"/&gt; They decided while the tweet was distasteful it was not criminal.&lt;ref name="Blair250816"/&gt; The tweet was deleted.&lt;ref name="Blair250816"/&gt;

===Pakistani men and Rochdale===
Hopkins objected to Rochdale commemorating National Pakistan Day on 23 March 2015 and claimed to base her objection on a [[Rochdale sex trafficking gang|Rochdale sex trafficking case]] involving nine predominantly Pakistani men and forty-seven white victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/29/katie-hopkins-reported-police-race-hate-rochdale-pakistani-sex-abuse|title=Katie Hopkins accused of race hate by linking Pakistani men with sex abuse|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 March 2015|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of tweets, she posted images of the felons with the caption "are these your friends too?"

===Migrants===
On 17 April 2015, Hopkins wrote a column in ''The Sun'' in  comparing migrants to "cockroaches" and "feral humans" and said they were "spreading like the norovirus". She wrote that gunships should be used to stop migrants from crossing the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/20/katie-hopkins-sun-migrants-article-petition-nears-180000-mark|title=Katie Hopkins compares migrants to 'cockroaches' and suggests using gunships to stop them crossing the Mediterranean|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 April 2015|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITV180415"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2015-04-18/katie-hopkins-compares-migrants-to-cockroaches-and-suggests-using-gunships-to-stop-them-crossing-the-mediterranean/|title=Katie Hopkins compares migrants to 'cockroaches' and suggests using gunships to stop them crossing the Mediterranean|publisher=[[ITV News]]|date=18 April 2015|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gander"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gander|first=Kashmira|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/hateful-katie-hopkins-column-on-migrants-causes-twitter-backlash-as-russell-brand-wades-into-debate-10186342.html|title='Hateful' Katie Hopkins column on migrants causes Twitter backlash, as Russell Brand wades into debate|work=[[The Independent]]|date=17 April 2015|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her remarks were condemned by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commission for Human Rights]], [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein]].&lt;ref name="Stone240415"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Jon|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/katie-hopkins-migrant-cockroaches-column-resembles-progenocide-propaganda-says-the-un-10201959.html|title=Katie Hopkins' migrant 'cockroaches' column resembles pro-genocide propaganda, says the UN|work=The Independent|date=24 April 2015|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement released on 24 April 2015, he urged the UK to "curb incitement to hatred" by its "tabloid newspapers" and stated that Hopkins used "language very similar to that employed by Rwanda's ''[[Kangura]]'' newspaper and [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines|Radio Mille Collines]] during the run up to the [[Rwandan Genocide|1994 genocide]]", and noted that both media organisations were subsequently convicted by an international tribunal of public incitement to commit [[genocide]].&lt;ref name="Stone240415"/&gt;

Hopkins' column also drew criticism on Twitter, including from [[Russell Brand]], to whom Hopkins responded by accusing Brand's "[[champagne socialist]] humanity" of neglecting taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Gander"/&gt; Simon Usborne, writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', compared her use of the word "cockroach" to previous uses by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and just before the [[Rwandan Genocide]] by its perpetrators.&lt;ref name="Usborne2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/katie-hopkins-when-is-enough-enough-10186490.html|title=Katie Hopkins has just written a piece so hateful that it might give Hitler pause – why was it published?|work=The Independent|last=Usborne|first=Simon|date=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suspected that if any other contributor had written the piece it would not have been published and questioned her continued employment by the newspaper.&lt;ref name="Usborne2015"/&gt; [[Zoe Williams]] commented in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "It is no joke when people start talking like this.

A [[Change.org]] petition was initiated with the aim of getting ''The Sun'' to sack Hopkins.

Peter Herbert, chair of the Society of Black Lawyers, reported Hopkins and ''The Sun'' to Sir [[Bernard Hogan-Howe]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] Commissioner. Hopkins was questioned and not charged, and subsequently criticised the police for purportedly criminalising opinion, and stated that she would set up a Society of White Lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saul|first1=Heather|title=Katie Hopkins tweets about 'setting up society for white lawyers' after Met Police decide against charging her over allegations of inciting racial hatred|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/katie-hopkins-tweets-about-setting-up-society-for-white-lawyers-after-met-police-decide-against-a6720436.html|accessdate=5 November 2015|work=The Independent|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2016, the original article had been removed from ''The Sun''{{'}}s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://politicalscrapbook.net/2016/12/the-sun-deletes-katie-hopkins-article-calling-refugees-cockroaches-after-stop-funding-hate-campaign/|title=''The Sun'' Deletes Katie Hopkins' Article Calling Refugees 'Cockroaches' After Stop Funding Hate Campaign|work=Political Scrapbook|date=14 December 2016|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donald Trump===
Hopkins supported [[Donald Trump]]'s Republican presidential nomination in the ''Daily Mail'' during December: "I hear cries that he is a blithering idiot. I have often been called a deranged fool. But if this were true you could ignore me, ignore us, {{sic|imaging}} the two of us shouting naked at the rain. It's because we articulate sentiments repressed by the politically correct consensus that we have a voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2015/12/world-ends-donald-trump-discovers-respected-columnist-katie-hopkins-supports|title=World ends as Donald Trump discovers 'respected columnist' Katie Hopkins supports him|work=New Statesman|date=10 December 2016|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins defended Trump's [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump#Proposed Muslim immigration ban|remarks that all Muslims should be banned from entering the United States]].

When Neil pointed out there could be no legal problems with identifying an area she continued to refuse, saying only “I know those places exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodfellow|first=Mollie|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/katie-hopkins-no-go-areas-non-muslims-in-andrew-neil-bbc-daily-politics-interview-legally-accurate-a6769516.html|title=Katie Hopkins admits she cannot name 'no-go' areas for non-Muslims in Andrew Neil BBC Daily Politics interview|work=The Independent|date=11 December 2015|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racism, racial profiling, and Black Lives Matter===
In January 2017, a caller to her LBC programme named Joseph said she came over as racist, following which she said: "I genuinely believe 'racist' as a word has been used so much. I am sorry for the word racist in a way. I love language so much&amp;nbsp;... it's like a regular word now, it's lost all meaning to me". When tweeting the clip she added, "Call me racist. I don't care. I will stand up for white women being raped because you're scared to offend Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chandler|first=Mark|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/outrage-as-katie-hopkins-shares-neonazi-praise-after-racism-debate-a3430926.html|title=Outrage as Katie Hopkins shares neo-Nazi praise after 'racism' debate|work=London Evening Standard|date=2 January 2017|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins tweeted shortly afterwards: "Racial profiling is a good thing, call me racist. I don't care...it has lost all meaning". She later briefly retweeted a favourable response from an account named Anti Juden SS, whose avatar featured the [[Nazi swastika|Swastika]] (and the United States flag), later explaining that she had not looked at the handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Demianyk|first=Graeme|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/katie-hopkins-tweet-racist-neo-nazi_uk_586a91a3e4b0f24da6e93af7|title=Katie Hopkins Shares 'Neo-Nazi' Praise After Claiming 'Racism Has Lost All Meaning'|work=HuffPost|date=3 January 2017|accessdate=23 May 2017}} The ellipsis is in Hopkins' original tweet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gold|first=Tanya|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/01/press-regulation-will-be-a-boon-to-anti-journalists-like-katie-hopkins/#|title=Press regulation will be a boon to anti-journalists like Katie Hopkins|work=The Spectator|date=7 January 2017|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharing a poster on Twitter for the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Dear White People (TV series)|Dear White People]]'' at the beginning of May 2017, Hopkins added: "Dear black people. If your lives matter why do you stab and shoot each other so much". Although, the tweet was deleted, users of the social media site circulated screenshots of what appeared to be a reference to the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stolworthy|first=Jacob|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/katie-hopkins-dear-white-people-netflix-series-black-lives-matter-racist-tweet-a7713646.html|title=Katie Hopkins accused of racism after Dear White People tweet|work=The Independent|date=2 May 2017|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, she urged the London Mayor [[Sadiq Khan]] to use [[Water cannon#United Kingdom|water cannon]] against Black Lives Matter protesters at [[Heathrow Airport]], who had chained themselves to the tarmac of an approach road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chandler|first=Mark|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/black-lives-matter-katie-hopkins-causes-outrage-after-calling-for-water-cannon-to-be-used-against-a3313331.html|title=Black Lives Matter: Katie Hopkins causes outrage after calling for water cannon to be used against Heathrow protesters|work=London Evening Standard|date=5 August 2016|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor}}Manchester Arena bombing===
Regarding the Manchester Arena bombing, Hopkins wrote that "Britain is faced with some hard questions the people charged with protecting us are going to have to answer sooner or later". Hopkins asserted that the suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, was known to the police, and questioned how he was permitted to re-enter Britain unchallenged after visiting Libya.  "Our leaders allow such deeply suspicious characters back into Britain," wrote Hopkins, "and then expect us to swallow their lies that we will not give in to terror?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hopkins | first = Katie | date = 24 May 2017 | title = The Politicians Now Have Hundreds of Troops Protecting Them While Telling The Rest of Us To Keep Calm, Stay 'United' And Carry On.

The journalist [[Nick Cohen]] was among those who responded on Twitter: "Even if Hopkins knows nothing of Nazism – which I doubt – her "final solution" can only mean [[ethnic cleansing]]". Others, such as [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]], called for a boycott of the LBC radio station while they employ her.&lt;ref name="Nelson230517"/&gt; Interviewed later on Fox News by [[Tucker Carlson]], she called for people to insist on deportations among other responses to terrorist acts. She said: "I used the word 'final solution' in a tweet, and I would not in any way want to use that term and the inference other people lay on that. What I meant was, we need a lasting solution, a resolution to this".&lt;ref name="Hawkins"/&gt;&lt;!-- Main passage on her LBC sacking is in 'Subsequent broadcasting work'.

Following the [[2017 London Bridge attack|June 2017 London Bridge attack]] almost a fortnight later, Hopkins called for [[internment|internment camps]] to be used for those suspected of being Muslim extremists on Fox News' ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]''. The host [[Clayton Morris]] said, on behalf of the network staff, that everyone considered the "idea reprehensible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Karl|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/fox-news-distances-itself-from-farage-and-hopkins-internment-demands-1-4466308?fff|title=Fox News distances itself from Farage and Hopkins internment demands|work=The Scotsman|agency=Inews|date=5 June 2017|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fang|first=Marina|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-london-attack_us_59343347e4b075bff0f475f8|title=Fox News Host Disavows Internment Camps, After Panelists Suggest Rounding Up Muslims|work=HuffPost|date=4 June 2017|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppenheim|first=Maya|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/fox-news-katie-hopkins-internment-camp-london-attack-terror-stabbing-muslims-islam-a7775026.html|title=Fox News calls Katie Hopkins' internment camp remarks 'reprehensible'|work=The Independent|date=6 June 2017|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins' comments have been linked in the media with [[hate crimes]] against Muslims. A Muslim man in [[Heckmondwike]] stated that he was attacked by assailants who graffitied his house with Hopkins' tweet, including her misspelling "#Machester".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finnegan|first1=Stephanie|title=Muslim man attacked by thugs who then vandalised his home quoting a racist Katie Hopkins tweet|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/muslim-man-attacked-thugs-who-13237258|accessdate=26 June 2017|work=Manchester Evening News|date=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean===
In July 2017, Hopkins flew to [[Catania]] in Sicily to visit a ship known as the C-Star hired by the [[Identitarian movement#In Europe|Defend Europe]] movement, which has the intention of hindering the work of "search and rescue" vessels in the Mediterranean used by charities such as [[Save the Children]] to save trafficked migrants and refugees.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppenheimn|first=Maya|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/katie-hopkins-defend-europe-meeting-far-right-activists-c-star-ship-anti-immigrant-mediterranean-a7857911.html|title=Katie Hopkins branded 'PR machine for extremists' after meeting group aiming to hamper refugee rescues in Med|work=The Independent|date=24 July 2017|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defend Europe is supported by the American white-nationalist [[David Duke]] and the neo-Nazi ''[[The Daily Stormer|Daily Stormer]]'' website.&lt;ref name="Mulhall"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulhall|first=Joe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/21/katie-hopkins-boat-far-right-activists-sicily-migrants|title=Why has Katie Hopkins set sail with a bunch of far-right activists?|work=The Guardian|date=21 July 2017|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins tweets suggested she was actively supporting Defend Europe, rather than covering the subject for her employer: "Looking forward to meeting the crew of the C-Star in Catania tomorrow.

In December 2016, the [[Daily Mail and General Trust]] settled a libel case brought by the Mahmood family with £150,000 damages, plus legal costs, over two articles by Hopkins posted on the Mailonline website which claimed members of the Muslim family were extremists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38367563|title=Katie Hopkins apologises to family over al-Qaeda claims|publisher=BBC News|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITV191216"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-12-19/mailonline-forced-to-pay-out-150k-over-libellous-katie-hopkins-column/|title=MailOnline forced to pay out £150k over libellous Katie Hopkins column|publisher=ITV News|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The columns published at the time of the incident falsely claimed that officials were right to stop the family flying to Los Angeles to visit [[Disneyland]] because the two men were connected to [[Al-Qaeda|al-Qaida]], and that their stated plans were a "lie".&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Jasper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/19/mail-pays-out-150k-to-muslim-family-over-katie-hopkins-column|title=Mail pays out £150k to Muslim family over Katie Hopkins column|work=The Guardian|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the settlement, the assertions from the Mahmood family were accepted as true by the ''Mail'' and Hopkins; the family had arranged to stay with another brother living in California,&lt;ref name="ITV191216"/&gt; The family's MP, [[Stella Creasy]], complained to the prime minister [[David Cameron]] at the time about the family's treatment, but Hopkins said Creasy was  a "whinging…blond-bobbed maniac".&lt;ref name="Dearden241215"/&gt;

In a statement from the family's solicitors, [[Carter-Ruck]], they said: "matters are not helped when sensationalist and, frankly, Islamophobic articles such as this are published, and which caused us all a great deal of distress and anxiety.

===Jackie Teale===

In November 2017, Hopkins' former employers [[Mail Online]] apologised and paid "substantial damages" to teacher Jackie Teale, after Hopkins had made false accusations of taking her class to a [[Donald Trump]] protest in Westminster.&lt;ref name="Ruddick281117"/&gt;

===Daily Mirror===

In May 2018, Hopkins won an [[Independent Press Standards Organisation|IPSO]] case against the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' for claiming that she had been detained in South Africa in February 2018 for taking [[ketamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new|last=Embury-Dennis|first=Tom|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/katie-hopkins-daily-mirror-south-africa-headline-drug-racism-ipso-complaint-a8367581.html|title=Katie Hopkins wins IPSO case against Daily Mirror for claiming she was detained for drugs rather than 'spreading racial hatred'|work=The Independent|date=25 May 2018|access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mirror'' updated the headline to say that she had been detained for spreading racial hatred, and included a correction in the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saunders|first=Emmeline|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-hopkins-detained-south-africa-11977548|title=Katie Hopkins DETAINED in South Africa for 'spreading racial hatred' after taking ketamine while collapsed in the street|work=The Mirror|date=6 February 2018|access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==
In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European Parliament Election]], Hopkins stood as a candidate for the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England Constituency]] as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] candidate. She polled 8,971 votes or 0.6% of the total votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/elections/euro/09/html/ukregion_36.stm |title=European Election 2009 &amp;#124; South West |publisher=BBC News |date=8 June 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apprentice villain Katie Hopkins standing for Euro election|url=http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Apprentice-villain-Katie-Hopkins-standing-Euro-election/story-12300046-detail/story.html|accessdate=21 April 2015|work=Western Daily Press|date=11 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111180920/http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Apprentice-villain-Katie-Hopkins-standing-Euro-election/story-12300046-detail/story.html|archivedate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late September 2015, Hopkins spoke at a fringe event organised by the [[Electoral Reform Society]] at the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP)'s annual conference. After derogatory comments about the appointment of [[Michelle Mone]] to the [[House of Lords]], she said: "Frankly, I don't really mind if we seal up the room and gas the lot of them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Jasper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/25/katie-hopkins-wouldnt-mind-if-house-of-lords-was-sealed-up-and-gassed|title=Katie Hopkins 'wouldn't mind' if House of Lords was sealed up and gassed|work=The Guardian|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UKIP said Hopkins was not a party member and, although she has reportedly applied to join on several occasions, her applications have always been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Payne|first=Sebastian|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/09/watch-ukip-supporter-katie-hopkins-advocates-gassing-the-house-of-lords/|title=Watch: Ukip supporter Katie Hopkins advocates gassing the House of Lords|work=The Spectator (Coffee House blog)|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La Forja - Jovent Revolucionari''' (''The Forge - Revolutionary Youth'') is a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Catalan independence|Catalan independentist]] youth organization that acts in all the [[Catalan Countries]]. La Forja is part of the [[Popular Unity Candidacy–Constituent Call]] (CUP-CC)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catalunyapress.cat/texto-diario/mostrar/1078784/cup-decideix-aquest-diumenge-seu-suport-investidura-quim-torra La CUP decideix aquest diumenge el seu suport a la investidura de Quim Torra]. Catalunya Press, 13 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; coalition and has very close ties with the political party [[Poble Lliure]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eltemps.cat/article/4700/passat-present-i-futur-de-lesquerra-independentista Passat, present i futur de l’esquerra independentista]. [[El Temps]], 23 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Creation of Arran and split===
Before 2012 the Catalan independentis left had two youth organizations: [[Maulets (politics)|Maulets-JIR]] and CAJEI. The first one was founed in 1999 by the union of Maulets (youth wing of [[Catalunya Lliure]]) and the Catalan Revolutionary Youth (JIR, youth of [[People's Unity Assembly]]). The second one was created in 2002 by members of [[Endavant]]. Both organizations merged in 2012 creating [[Arran (organization)|Arran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.setmanaridirecta.info/noticia/neix-arran-fruit-del-proces-d%E2%80%99unio-entre-maulets-cajei |title=Neix l'organització Arran, fruit del procés de confluència entre Maulets i la CAJEI |publisher=[[Setmanari de Comunicació Directa]] |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=18 October 2018|language=ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708014521/http://setmanaridirecta.info/noticia/neix-arran-fruit-del-proces-d%E2%80%99unio-entre-maulets-cajei |archivedate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the confluence, some [[Maulets (politics)|Maulets-JIR]] ex-members (especially those close to the [[Movement for Defence of the Land]]), started to consider that the leadership of the new organization was following the political line of CAJEI. These ex-members of [[Maulets (politics)|Maulets-JIR]] became involved in the creation of the youth of the [[Catalan National Assembly]] (ANC), the National Assembly of the Independentist Youth (ANJI). Due to this, they were threatened with expulsion from [[Arran (organization)|Arran]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eltemps.cat/article/4700/passat-present-i-futur-de-lesquerra-independentista Passat, present i futur de l’esquerra independentista]. [[El Temps]], 23 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, groups of ex-Maulets created, along with other youth organizations, the Estudiants 9N movement, which organized a [[student strike]] to support the [[Catalan self-determination referendum, 2014|unofficial self-determination referendum]]. During the referendum campaign, some local chapters of [[Arran (organization)|Arran]] ([[Arbúcies]], for example) made posters asking to vote Yes, that the leadership of [[Arran (organization)|Arran]] ordered to retire. At the national assembly of that year, most members of [[Arran (organization)|Arran]] voted to expel those who participated in the [[Catalan National Assembly|ANC]], since that organization only fights for the independence of [[Catalonia]] and not the whole [[Catalan Countries]]. The vote was not valid because it did not reach the 70% of necessary quorum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ara.cat/politica/Tres-decades-inici-combat-maulet_0_2094390543.html Tres dècades de l’inici del “combat maulet”]. [[Ara (newspaper)|Ara]], 24 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

This vote caused a split in [[Arran (organization)|Arran]], with various local groups leaving the organization, including [[Mataró|Alt Maresme]], [[València]], [[Castelló de la Plana]], [[Badalona]], [[Cerdanyola del Vallès]] and [[Girona]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/90487/esperit/maulet/rebrota/arran L'esperit maulet rebrota a Arran]. Nació Digital, 12 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of the Youth Assemblies for Popular Unity===
On 28 December 2015, the Assemblies of the [[Alt Empordà]], [[Maresme|Alt Maresme]], [[Badalona]], [[Berguedà]], [[Cerdanyola del Vallès]], [[Mataró]] and [[Sants]] celebrated the Founding Congress of the Youth Assemblies for Popular Unity (AJUP) in the town of [[Celrà]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://elmon.cat/politica/neix_la_coordinadora_d_assemblees_de_joves_per_la_unitat_popular_157801 Neix la coordinadora d'Assemblees de joves per la Unitat Popular]. El Món, 28 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The political declaration of AJUP declared the [[Catalan Countries|Catalan Countries independentism]], [[Marxist socialism]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, [[feminism]] and [[ecologism]] as the main ideological lines of the organization. AJUP also considered the [[Popular Unity Candidacy|CUP]] as its "political reference".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.llibertat.cat/2016/01/neix-la-coordinadora-d-assemblees-de-joves-per-la-unitat-popular-33789 Neix la coordinadora d’Assemblees de joves per la Unitat Popular]. Llibertat.cat, 28 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation of La Forja===
In the second National Congress of AJUP, held on 3 and 4 February 2018 in [[Canet de Mar]], the organization was refounded as La Forja - Jovent Revolucionari. At the time of the foundation they were present in the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarques]]'' of [[Alt Empordà]], [[Barcelonès]], [[Gironès]], [[Maresme]], [[Segarra]], [[Tarragonès]], [[Vallès Occidental]] and [[Terres de l'Ebre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.llibertat.cat/2018/03/neix-la-forja-organitzacio-hereva-de-les-assemblees-de-joves-per-la-unitat-popular-ajup-41561 Neix ‘La Forja’, organització hereva de les Assemblees de Joves per la Unitat Popular (AJUP)].

[[File:2016 Labour Party Conference, conference hall.jpg|thumb|The 2016 Labour Party Conference at [[ACC Liverpool]]]]
The '''Labour Party Conference''', or annual national conference of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], is formally the supreme decision-making body of the Party. The conference is traditionally held on the final week in September, during the British [[party conference season]], when the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] is in recess, and after the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] have held their conferences. Labour is one of few British parties to use their annual gathering for voting and policy resolution. The conference opens on a Sunday and finishes the following Wednesday usually with an address for the [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]] but some exceptions including 2016 have been made. This means that the Leader's address is usually held on the Tuesday beforehand.

==Conference decisions==
In the [[United Kingdom]], each major political party holds an annual party conference during the [[party conference season]]. Conference is the supreme decision making body of the Labour Party.

===Delegates===
Delegates to the conference are elected by [[Constituency Labour Parties]], [[affiliated trade union]]s and [[socialist societies]]. Currently, affiliated trade unions hold 50% of the votes at the conference – down from 80% in the era before [[Tony Blair]]. Some 40% of the votes are wielded by the three largest trade unions ([[Unite the Union|Unite]], [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]], [[UNISON]]).

===Resolutions===
Resolutions for debate are put forward by CLPs and unions before the conference begins. In recent years, party members have had less say in what is debated at the annual conference, as the party leadership has tried to move policy-making increasingly into the new National Policy Forums, which meet in private.

===Role of the NEC===
The [[National Executive Committee]] leads the conference (although the details of the conference, including what is debated, are managed by the Conference Arrangements Committee) and if it does not agree with a resolution, the committee may put pressure on the backers to withdraw or ''remit'' it. ''Remittance'' means that the resolution's backers agree to "send back" the resolution to the National Executive so that it can consider the matter in more detail; this is viewed by some as a mere delaying tactic. The resolutions voted upon are normally ''composites'', meaning that they have been compiled by combining several resolutions put forward by different bodies into a single wording agreed beforehand.

===2003 Bournemouth===
The international guest speaker to address conference was [[Hamid Karzai]], the first [[President of Afghanistan|President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2003/labour_conference/ |title=Conference 2003: Labour |publisher= BBC News |date=3 March 2004 |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 Brighton===
The 2004 party conference was held in [[Brighton]] during the final week of September. Conference rejected a call for withdrawal from [[Iraq]], but accepted a resolution calling for renationalisation of the railways; the leadership declared that it would ignore this. The conference received some international glamour when it was addressed by the Irish rock star [[Bono]] who called for more action to combat the spread of [[AIDS]] and the debt crippling African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2004/labour_conference_04/default.stm |title=Labour Conference 2004 |publisher= BBC News |date=15 August 2007 |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conference closed with the singing of ''[[The Red Flag]]'' and ''[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]''.

===2005 Brighton===
Over 600 people were held under the recent terrorism acts, including [[Walter Wolfgang]] an 82-year-old refugee from Nazi Germany who was arrested for attempting to re-enter the conference without a pass. None was subsequently charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/over-600-held-under-terror-act-at-labour-conference-1-1098792 |title=Over 600 held under terror act at Labour conference |publisher= Johnston Publishing|work=Scotsman.com |date=3 October 2005 |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2005/party_conferences_05/default.stm |title=Conferences 2005 |publisher= BBC News |date=15 August 2007 |accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 Manchester===
In 2006 the conference was held in [[Manchester]] at the [[G-Mex]] and Manchester International Conference Centre from 24 to 28 September. It was the first time since 1974 that the main Labour conference was not held at a [[coast|seaside]] town and the first time since 1917 the Labour conference had been held in Manchester. This followed Labour's Spring 2004 conference which was held at the G-Mex for the first time. The conference was Blair's last as leader after he stated this would be the case just before the conference and at the conference itself. The start of the conference was marked with [[protests against the Iraq War]].

Tony Blair, in his last speech to conference as Labour Party leader and Prime Minister, praised the work of the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Gordon Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5380004.stm | title =It's hard to let go, admits Blair | date = 26 September 2006| work =BBC News | publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was addressed in a joint session by Labour's [[Mayor of London]], [[Ken Livingstone]] and the [[Mayor of Los Angeles]] [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] on the subject of [[climate change]]. [[Bob Geldof]] and Monica Naggaga from [[Oxfam]] ([[Uganda]]) spoke together about the plight of Africa. The main international guest speaker was the former [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Bill Clinton]]. Another international visitor – but not a speaker to the conference – was [[Shimon Peres]], the former [[Prime Minister of Israel]].

St Johns C.E. Primary School's steel band also performed there before Tony Blair came on stage.

===2007 Bournemouth===
The 2007 conference was held in the [[Bournemouth International Centre]] from 23 to 27 September. The conference was the first with [[Gordon Brown]] as leader of the Labour Party and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], and he laid out his plans for his premiership. It was a first conference for [[Harriet Harman]] as Deputy Leader and [[First Secretary of State]].

===2008 Manchester===
The 2008 conference was held between 20 and 24 September in [[Manchester]] at [[Manchester Central (Conference Centre)|Manchester Central]] (formerly G-Mex). The opening day of conference was moved from Sunday to Saturday to allow people who work during the week to attend. The Labour leader and Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, delivered his keynote address on 23 September.

===2009 Brighton===
The 2009 conference was held in Brighton from 27 September to 1 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labour.org.uk/conference/ |title=Annual Conference 2011 |publisher=The Labour Party |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted for a particularly impassioned address from [[Peter Mandelson]] given on 28 September in which he claimed that Labour was in "the fight of our lives" as the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|forthcoming general election]] approached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8279053.stm|title= Election up for grabs – Mandelson|publisher= BBC News|date= 28 September 2009|accessdate=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon Brown gave his keynote address to the conference on the afternoon of 29 September, saying that Labour was "not done yet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8279701.stm|title= We're not done yet, insists Brown|publisher= BBC News|date= 29 September 2009|accessdate=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards Britain's biggest selling newspaper, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' announced that it would withdraw its support for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and gave its backing to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6855370.ece|title= Labour fails to conceal its anger after The Sun switches to support Conservatives|publisher=Times Newspapers Limited|work= Times Online|first= Phillipe|last= Naughton|date= 30 September 2009|accessdate=30 September 2009}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Union leader and Labour supporter [[Tony Woodley]] responded to this by tearing up a copy of that edition of The Sun, telling the audience: "In Liverpool, we learnt a long time ago what to do. I suggest the rest of the country should do exactly the same thing";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8282535.stm |title= Harman turns fire on Sun decision |publisher=BBC News |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the hostility felt in Liverpool towards ''The Sun'' newspaper following its controversial allegations about the behaviour of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool FC]] supporters during the [[Hillsborough disaster]] 20 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Owen Gibson  |author2=Helen Carter |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/18/hillsborough-anniversary-sun-newspaper |title=Hillsborough: 20 years on, Liverpool has still not forgiven the newspaper it calls 'The Scum'|publisher=Guardian News and Media |work=The Guardian|date= 18 April 2009|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Prime Ministers Keynote Address Gordon Brown listed no fewer than twenty Labour Party achievements since 1997 and received an early standing ovation. The address would be his last as Prime Minister and for the Party would be their thirteenth and last party conference in government.

===2010 Manchester===
Shortly after losing the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], the 2010 Conference took place between 26–30 September 2010 at [[Manchester Central (Conference Centre)|Manchester Central Conference Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/25/labour-leadership-result-candidates-manchester|title= Labour leadership result: candidates head to Manchester to hear verdict|date=25 September 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=7 October 2014|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference started with the announcement of the results of the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010|2010 leadership election]] and was [[Ed Miliband]]'s first conference as leader. In his first major speech as leader on 28 September, Miliband told delegates that his "new generation" would return the party to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11417906|title= Ed Miliband tells Labour: We're the optimists now|publisher= BBC|work= BBC News|first= Emma|last= Griffiths|date= 28 September 2010|accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day [[David Miliband]] announced he would not be serving in his brother's shadow cabinet, although he would continue as an MP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11432762|title= David Miliband says he won't join brother Ed's team|publisher= BBC|work= BBC News|date= 29 September 2010|accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other highlights of the conference included activists condemning the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]]'s proposed public spending cuts as "obscene" on 27 September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11422247|title= Labour activists reject 'obscene' coalition cuts|publisher= BBC|work= BBC News|first= Brian|last= Wheeler|date= 27 September 2010|accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a close of conference address from [[Harriet Harman]] in which she told delegates that Ed Miliband would "fortify" the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11441103|title= Harriet Harman says Labour 'fortified' by new leader|publisher= BBC|work= BBC News|first= Emma|last= Griffiths|date= 30 September 2010|accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 Liverpool===
The 2011 Conference took place in [[Liverpool]] from 25–29 September. It was the first time since 1925 that Labour had held its Annual Conference there. On 26 September delegates voted to scrap the tradition of [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King |first=Victoria |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15054351 |title=Labour delegates vote to scrap shadow cabinet elections |publisher=BBC News |date= 26 September 2011|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Miliband]]'s keynote speech on 27 September suffered a five-minute blackout after all media communications were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2011/09/27/labour-leader-ed-miliband-s-keynote-speech-attacks-tories-and-promises-new-bargain-despite-broadcast-black-out-from-liverpool-100252-29495983/|title= Labour leader Ed Miliband's keynote speech attacks Tories and promises 'new bargain' despite broadcast black-out from Liverpool|publisher= Trinity Mirror|work= Liverpool Echo|date= 27 September 2011|accessdate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 Manchester ===
The 2012 Conference was held in [[Manchester]] from 30 September–4 October at Manchester Central Conference Centre. Labour Leader Ed Miliband's speech was the first by a Labour leader in around twenty years to be delivered without the use of an [[Autocue]], enabling him to walk up and down the stage during his speech while maintaining eye contact with his audience, replicating the style of [[David Cameron]] in 2005 when running for leadership of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/miliband-ditches-the-autocue-for-his-labour-conference-speech-but-who-planted-the-tree-8194625.html|title=Miliband ditches the autocue for his Labour Conference speech, but who planted the tree?|work=[[The Independent]] newspaper|author=Andy McSmith|date=2 October 2012|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 Brighton===
The 2013 Conference took place in [[Brighton]] 22–25 September at the [[Brighton Centre]].

===2014 London (Special Conference)===
A special conference was held at [[ExCeL London]] on 1 March to approve rule changes arising from former general-secretary [[Ray Collins, Baron Collins of Highbury|Ray Collins]] review of party reform. The changes included replacing the electoral college system for selecting new leaders with a "one member, one vote" system. Mass membership would be encouraged by allowing "registered supporters" to join at a low cost, as well as full membership. Members from the trade unions would also have to explicitly "opt in" rather than "opt out" of paying a political levy to Labour.&lt;ref name=independent-20140228&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tony-blair-backs-ed-milibands-internal-labour-reforms-9161291.html |title=Tony Blair backs Ed Miliband's internal Labour reforms |author=Andrew Grice |newspaper=The Independent |date=28 February 2014 |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-20140301&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/mar/01/labour-votes-on-membershipunion-reforms-at-special-conference-politics-live-blog |title=Miliband wins vote on Labour party reforms with overwhelming majority |author=Andrew Sparrow |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 March 2014 |accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collins-review&gt;{{cite report |url=http://action.labour.org.uk/page/-/Collins_Report_Party_Reform.pdf |title=The Collins Review Into Labour Party Reform |author=Ray Collins |publisher=Labour Party |date=February 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 Manchester===
The 2014 Conference was held in [[Manchester]] from 21–24 September at Manchester Central Conference Centre. Ed Miliband was criticised by his own colleagues for failing to mention the deficit and immigration in his Conference address, despite having promised to do so in his pre-speech press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/24/ed-miliband-deficit-unite-len-mccluskey-labour|title= Miliband under fire from his own side for forgetting to mention deficit|work=The Guardian|author1=Nicholas Watt |author2=Patrick Wintour |author3=Rowena Mason |author4=Alan Travis |date=24 September 2014|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Miliband's last Autumn Conference address as Labour Leader.

===2015 Brighton===
The results of the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|leadership]] and [[Labour Party (UK) deputy leadership election, 2015|deputy leadership]] elections were announced prior to the Annual Conference on 12 September at a special conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://press.labour.org.uk/post/118867112494/timetable-announced-for-labour-leader-and-deputy |title=Timetable announced for Labour Leader and Deputy Leader elections |accessdate=28 May 2015 |date=13 May 2015 |website= press.labour.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first time that Corbyn had used one to deliver a speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11888959/Jeremy-Corbyn-starts-to-learn-to-use-an-autocue-five-days-before-his-big-conference-speech.html|title=Jeremy Corbyn starts to learn to use an Autocue - five days before his big conference speech|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|author=Christopher Hope, Chief Political Correspondent|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 Liverpool===
{{Commons category|Labour Party Conference, 2016}}
The 2016 Conference took place at [[ACC Liverpool]], it started on 25 September and ran until Wednesday 28 September. The result of the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|Leadership election 2016]] was announced the previous day with [[Jeremy Corbyn]] being re-elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labour.org.uk/pages/annual-conference-2016 Welcome to Annual Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; The conference heard impassioned pleas for unity and a need for the party to gain power from Deputy Leader [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] and Mayor of London [[Sadiq Khan]]. The party faithful were widely criticised for their apparent disunity among elected representatives but the gathering in [[Liverpool]] came together in harmony on many issues including opposition to plans for grammar school expansions, a 'hard brexit' and on accepting more unaccompanied child refugees into Britain.

===2017 Brighton===
The 2017 Conference took place at the 5,000 capacity [[Brighton Centre]] in [[Brighton]]. It ran from Sunday 24 September to Wednesday 27 September 2017, with the Leader's Speech taking place on the final day. 

Jeremy Corbyn's leadership speech lasted 75 minutes and included a number of well received jokes, which came at the expense of both the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] - specifically their reference to being unable to find a 'magic money tree', to fund new initiatives, prior to 2017 general election, only to find £1 billion to serve as the basis of a [[confidence and supply]] deal with the [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] following the Conservative Party's re-election with a reduced majority&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/tory-dup-deal-agreement-full/|title=Tory-DUP deal: The agreement in full|last=|first=|date=26 June 2017|website=The Telegraph|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and the [[Daily Mail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-conference-speech-labour-conference-2017-jeremy-corbyn-to-use-speech-to-say-public-services-and-businesses-must-be-more-accountable-politics-live?page=with:block-59cb9d13e4b050237a54f6fd#block-59cb9d13e4b050237a54f6fd|title=Labour conference 2017: Jeremy Corbyn's keynote speech – as it happened|last=|first=|date=27 September 2017|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of policy, Corbyn pledged that a Labour government would give cities the power to bring in [[Rent regulation|rent controls]] and introduce restrictions on [[Gentrification|gentrification projects]], citing the then recent [[Grenfell Tower fire]].

During the course of the conference [[Jeremy Corbyn|Corbyn]] said that he was not planning a second referendum on [[Brexit]], but refused to rule out Labour backing one. He also said there were some “positives” from leaving the EU.

The Labour deputy leader, [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]], announced a number of policy plans, including:
* Forcing gambling companies to pay a levy to fund research and NHS treatment to help problem gamblers deal with their addiction
* Banning football clubs from signing shirt sponsorship deals with betting companies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/26/labour-conference-2017-former-scottish-labour-leader-says-corbyn-partly-to-blame-for-brexit-politics-live?page=with:block-59ca8627e4b021792a4faa50#block-59ca8627e4b021792a4faa50|title=Labour conference: Corbyn says Brexit has some 'positives' and he's not planning second referendum - live|last=|first=|date=26 September 2017|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The conference also received attention as a result of a passionate speech delivered by [[Lauren Stocks]], a 16-year-old schoolgirl from [[Greater Manchester]], that subsequently went viral. Commentator quickly drew parallels with [[William Hague|William Hague's]] famous 1977 [[Conservative Party (UK) Conference|Conservative conference]], which he delivered when he was also 16. Stocks spoke about the toll that changes to the exams had taken on her and her classmates and argued that:&lt;blockquote&gt;There's a statistic we were shown when I was about 13 or 14 that told me 3 in 10 people in every classroom suffer with a mental illness.

The prospect of a second referendum on the UK's relationship with the European Union was a heavily discussed topic at the conference. Both Leader Jeremy Corbyn and Deputy Leader Tom Watson had said should the conference vote for a second referendum they would support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Rawnsley | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Helm | first2 = Toby | title = Tom Watson: 'If Labour members call for a people’s vote on Brexit, then we must respect that' | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/22/labour-tom-watson-interview-peoples-vote-brexit | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 22 September 2018 | accessdate = 24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = PA | author-link = Press Association | title = Jeremy Corbyn would back second EU referendum if Labour activists support it | url = https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/jeremy-corbyn-would-back-second-eu-referendum-if-labour-activists-support-it-1-9362576 | work = [[Yorkshire Post]] |date= 23 September 2018 |accessdate= 24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion was discussed by delegates on the Sunday, including MPs and representatives from [[People's Vote]] and other delegates, and after five hours they had written a two-paged motion stating that "If we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote".&lt;ref name="GU-McDnlref"&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Walker | first1 = Peter | last2 = Stewart | first2 = Heather | last3 = Elgot | first3 = Jessica | title = McDonnell: new Brexit referendum should not include remain option | url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/24/mcdonnell-new-brexit-referendum-should-not-include-remain-option | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 24 September 2018 | accessdate = 24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Labour to vote on 'keeping all options on the table' including backing second Brexit vote | url = http://www.itv.com/news/2018-09-24/labour-party-conference-brexit/ | work = [[ITV News]] | date = 24 September 2018 | access-date = 24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote on motion took place on the Tuesday.

Party delegates voted on the Member of Parliament reselection process.

In a language nest, older speakers of the language take part in [[early childhood education|early-childhood education]] with a view to improving intergenerational language transference.

== In New Zealand ==
The first ''kōhanga reo'' was founded in [[Wainuiomata]] in 1982, and was followed by the establishment of primary schools and secondary schools ([[Kura Kaupapa Māori]]) where [[Māori language|Māori]] is the primary language of instruction.

According to Al Jazeera, the percentage of Maori people speaking the language has increased by a few percentage points from the early 1980s to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/livingthelanguage/2012/04/2012416141630195978.html|title = New Zealand: The Maori|date = July 17, 2014|accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = Al Jazeera|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Christopher Moseley says that this statistic is "quite encouraging" because "compared to how quickly a language can disappear, in just one generation in extreme cases, the figures are good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/livingthelanguage/2012/04/2012416141630195978.html|title = New Zealand: The Maori|date = July 17, 2014|accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = Al Jazeera|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Libel trial of Joseph Howe''' was a court case heard 2 March 1835 in which newspaper editor [[Joseph Howe]] was charged with [[seditious libel]] by civic politicians in [[Nova Scotia]].  Howe's victory in court was considered monumental at the time. In the first issue of the ''Novascotian'' following the acquittal, Howe claimed that "the press of Nova-Scotia is Free."&lt;ref name=beck39&gt;Beck (1974), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars, such as [[John Ralston Saul]], have argued that Howe's libel victory established the fundamental basis for the freedom of the press in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Saul, p. 10; Kesterton, pp. 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Barry Cahill writes that the trial was significant in colonial legal history because it was a long delayed replay of the [[John Peter Zenger|Zenger case]] (1734).&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, p. 563&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{History of Nova Scotia}}
During the year 1834, Howe was starting to attract attention to himself due to his strong independent viewpoints in his editorials in the ''[[Novascotian]]'', the Government was starting to take notice.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Howe had eventually reached his breaking point and in late 1834 wrote in the ''Novascotian'' that he was going to start a campaign in the interest of bringing to light the wrongful actions of government.&lt;ref&gt;Rosner, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 1, 1835, the final piece of this campaign was published in the ''Novascotian'', a letter signed "The People".&lt;ref&gt;Beck (1974), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

This letter accused the magistrates of, "reprehensible irresponsibility, incompetence, and self-interestedness in the conduct of their responsibilities."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, in the letter [[Joseph Howe]] accused Halifax politicians and police of pocketing £30,000 over a thirty-year period. Due to the letter being published, Howe was put on trial for [[seditious libel]], being charged with "seditiously contriving, devising, and intending to stir up and incite discontent and sedition among His Majesty's subjects."&lt;ref name=rosner12&gt;Rosner, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The crime of seditious libel had only been defined 200 years prior to the time of Howe's trial and was seen by many as an unfair crime as it could be as broad or as specific as the court chose."&lt;ref&gt;[[Seditious libel]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
The trial took place in the present day library of [[Province House (Nova Scotia)]] and the judge in the case was [[Brenton Halliburton]].  Howe represented himself in the trial as no lawyer would defend him.  Howe used as the basis of his argument the [[Libel Act 1792]].&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, 1996, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;  He presented for six and a quarter hours addressing the jury, citing case after case of civic corruption. He spoke eloquently about the importance of press freedom, urging jurors "to leave an unshackled press as a legacy to your children." Even though the judge instructed the jury to find Howe guilty, jurors took only ten minutes to acquit him.&lt;ref name=rosner12/&gt;

== Legacy ==

The victory of Howe in the court was considered monumental at the time.  In the first issue of the ''Novascotian'' following the acquittal, Howe claimed that "the press of Nova-Scotia is Free."&lt;ref name=beck39&gt;Beck (1974), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars have argued that Howe's libel victory changed little in the strict legal sense, however, other scholars insist that the case established the fundamental basis for the freedom of the press in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Saul, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Howe scholar J. M. Beck argues that Howe was victorious convincing a jury that the libel law was unjust, however, his trial had no immediate effect on changing the civil or criminal code with respect to libel.  Beck asserts that the idea that Howe's trial contributed to the freedom of the press in Canada is a, "myth that has little basis in fact".&lt;ref name=beck39/&gt;&lt;ref name=campbell114&gt;Campbell, 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, eight years after the trial, Howe's successor at the ''Novascotian''  Richard Nugent was charged and found guilty of libel (1843).&lt;ref name=beck39/&gt; Nugent was imprisoned due to his inability to pay damages.&lt;ref name=beck39/&gt;  Beck also notes that in 1843, the British Parliament passed a law that allowed the accused to use truth of the libel as their defence, which led to freedom of the press.&lt;ref name=beck39/&gt;

Scholars have agreed with the strict legal sense of Beck's argument, however, scholar Cecil Rosner states, "The Howe trial is noteworthy more for its symbolic effect than any legal precedent it may have set...charges of [[sedition]] have largely disappeared [but] journalists across the country continue to face civil libel threats...".&lt;ref name=rosner12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosner argues that Canadian law restricts the sources that journalists may use, and despite the introduction of Freedom of the Press in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] courts are still limiting press rights if they deem it necessary; Quebec does not accept truth as an appropriate defense for a libel case; and while journalists in the United States of America enjoy the ability to criticize their elected representatives without risk of prosecution, Canadian journalists do not have the same protection. Rosner concludes that "...more victories remain to be won".&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyndsay M. Campbell argues that the trial did eventually change the law.  Howe was the first in Nova Scotia to argue [[Intention (criminal law)|intent]] before a jury.&lt;ref name=campbell114/&gt;  Campbell also notes that while Howe's defence did not persuade the presiding judge, it was a defense that would be used by lawyers in future cases.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  Howe changed how the law was perceived by both the legal profession and by the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 115-116&lt;/ref&gt;  The timing of the trial was crucial to the lasting effect it had on Canada.  It occurred when the number of newspapers was growing rapidly and they were all pushing their own boundaries when it came to political commentary.&lt;ref name=campbell116&gt;Campbell, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;  Howe's trial removed the fear of prosecution from these newspapers for having political commentary of their own, as Campbell puts it, "The sense of what was possible had changed."&lt;ref name=campbell116/&gt;

John Ralston Saul states that by, "...winning his acquittal, Howe established the fundamental ideas, principles, and shapes of freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Canada."&lt;ref name=saul10&gt;Saul, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Saul acknowledges that, in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, the laws have regressed and progressed multiple times since Howe's trial.  Saul argues that Howe created the, "...intellectual foundation of how we still struggle to solidify and to widen the nature of freedom of speech and of the press."&lt;ref name=saul10/&gt;  Saul states that Howe's trial also had a significant influence on the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].  He argues there is a clear link between Howe's defense and lines 9 and 10 of the Charter, which refer to freedom of speech and freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Saul, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Saul also references many public leaders across Canada since Howe's trial who were influenced by him, such as Fred Dickson who was the leader of the [[1919 Winnipeg Strike]] on trial for seditious libel, who read Howe's defence was their own to, "speak from an ethical center in their own public lives."&lt;ref&gt;Saul, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film ==
In 1961, the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) produced a 28-minute film about the trial entitled ''Joseph Howe: The Tribune of Nova Scotia''.&lt;ref name=nfb&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/joseph_howe_tribune_nova_scotia/| title=Joseph Howe: The Tribune of Nova Scotia| publisher=NFB| accessdate=2014-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223579/| title=Joseph Howe: The Tribune of Nova Scotia| publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]| accessdate=2014-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M 023.JPG|thumb|A cross in Macelj]]
In May and June 1945, at the [[end of World War II in Europe]], the forests near [[Macelj]], a village in northern [[Croatia]], were the location where a large number of persons who were [[Independent State of Croatia|soldiers of NDH or closely associated with NDH]], were shot by soldiers of the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav army (the Partisans)]]. This was part of the events referred to as the [[Bleiburg tragedy]].
==Events==
In 1992, after Croatia became independent, 1163 bodies were excavated from 23 mass graves in the region, leaving around 130 possible mass grave locations unexplored.&lt;ref name="vecernji-2012"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.vecernji.hr/regije/macelj-gora-zlocina-clanak-410508 | newspaper = [[Večernji list]] | language = Croatian | title = Macelj - gora zločina! | date = 2012-05-16 | accessdate = 2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=October 2017}} [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA analysis]] was conducted on a few hundred of them. The names of identified persons were not officially published, but it is clear that they were victims of a mass execution. A large number of the bodies were dropped into the area's many pits, making it difficult to locate all casualties. Further investigation on this issue was not conducted, and final conclusions about the excavations cannot be drawn yet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3800">'''Macroeconomic populism''' is a term coined by [[Rudi Dornbusch]] and [[Sebastian Edwards]] in a 1990 paper.&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Macroeconomic Populism |first=Rudiger |last=Dornbusch |first2=Sebastian |last2=Edwards |journal=[[Journal of Development Economics]] |volume=32 |issue=2 |year=1990 |pages=247–277 |doi=10.1016/0304-3878(90)90038-D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to the policies by many [[Latin American]] administrations by which [[government spending]] and [[real wages]] increase in a non-sustainable way leading to [[inflation]], then [[stagflation]] and ultimately an [[economic collapse]] that drops real wages to lower than they were before the [[populist]] period began. The paper cites as examples [[Salvador Allende]] in [[Chile]] (1970–1973), and [[Alan García]] first term in [[Peru]] (1985–1990). In 1991, Dornbusch and Edwards edited a book titled ''The [[Macroeconomics]] of Populism in Latin America'' which analyzed more cases like [[Argentina]] between 1973 and 1976, [[Mexico]] between 1970 and 1982, and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3684436.html|title=The Macroeconomics of Populism in Latin America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Paul Krugman]] cited Argentina's policies under [[Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner]] and [[Venezuela]] as new cases of macroeconomic populism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/macroeconomic-populism-returns/|title=Macroeconomic Populism Returns|work=Paul Krugman Blog|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/the-macroeconomics-of-reality-tv-populism/|title=The Macroeconomics of Reality-TV Populism|work=Paul Krugman Blog|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, during a lecture he said he did not endorse the attacks on Argentina nor what it looks to him as a "somewhat out of control fiscal and monetary policy."&lt;ref&gt;November 18, 2014. TN. Palabras + Palabras -.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal definition ==
The definition of macroeconomic populism in the original paper states as follows: "Macroeconomic populism is an approach to economics that emphasizes growth and income distribution and deemphasizes the risks of inflation and deficit finance, external constraints and the reaction of economic agents to aggressive non-market policies."&lt;ref name="paper"/&gt;

== Phases ==
The start of a populist cycle is generally after a stabilization program. The economy has idle capacity and the budget and external balance have room left for a expansionary policy.
# '''Phase I''' includes a high increase in public spending and an increase in real wages and employment. Gross domestic product increases and there is low impact on inflation. Shortages are alleviated by imports. There is a reduction in reserves or debt default.
# '''Phase II''' includes an increase in inflation, although wages keep up. Bottlenecks lead to price and exchange controls. The budget deficit greatly increases as a result of subsidies. The economy runs into [[stagflation]].
# '''Phase III''' is characterized by shortages, extreme acceleration of inflation (possibly [[hyperinflation]]), and capital flight. A decline in tax revenue combined with high inflation results in an increase in the budget deficit ([[Olivera–Tanzi effect]]). A stabilization attempt  by reducing subsidies and devaluation leads to a drop in real wages. As the paper states "politics become unstable. It becomes clear that the government has lost."
# '''Phase IV''': A new government implements orthodox policies to stabilize the economy. Once the economy is stabilized real wages will have fallen lower than before Phase I began.

==Background and ideology==
The Maoist Communist Party of Manipur (MCPM) was formed in August 2011 after amended its constitution in accordance with [[Marxism–Leninism–Maoism]] and decided to take up M–L–M as the party's guiding ideology. After the party's first conference which was held in the [[North-East India|North-East]], the party issued a statement declaring that the MCPM has decided to carry out the [[New Democratic Revolution]] and would conduct the [[protracted people's war]] in collaboration with the other "Maoist revolutionary parties."&lt;ref name="ToI-10016542"/&gt;

==Organisation==
The Coordinator of the Standing Committee of MCPM is Kyonghan,&lt;ref name="IT–RT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://imphaltimes.com/maoist-releases-red-thunder/ |archiveurl=http://archive.imphaltimes.com/maoist-releases-red-thunder/ |title=Maoist releases "Red Thunder" |newspaper=Imphal Times |location=Imphal |date=30 September 2013 |accessdate=13 June 2014 |archivedate=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MT–2250"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://manipurtimes.com/news-article/the-peoples-chronicle-news/item/2250-maoist-communist-party-manipur-for-a-common-platform-of-maoists |title=Maoist Communist Party Manipur for a common platform of Maoists |publisher=Manipur Times |date=9 August 2013 |accessdate=30 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810162159/http://manipurtimes.com/news-article/the-peoples-chronicle-news/item/2250-maoist-communist-party-manipur-for-a-common-platform-of-maoists |archivedate=10 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[Chairman#Vice chairman and deputy chairman|vice chairperson]] is Mang Ulen San.&lt;ref name="TPC–26230"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thepeopleschronicle.in/?p=26230 |title=Maoist to launch monthly journal on Irabot Day |publisher=The People's Chronicle |date=30 September 2013 |accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Publicity and Propaganda secretary is Nonglen Meitei.&lt;ref name="IT-MayDay"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://imphaltimes.com/may-day-wishes-from-maoist-communist-party-manipur/ |archiveurl=http://archive.imphaltimes.com/may-day-wishes-from-maoist-communist-party-manipur/ |title=May Day wishes from Maoist Communist Party, Manipur |work=Imphal Times |location=Imphal |date=30 April 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2014 |archivedate=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://imphaltimes.com/news/item/342-maoist-highlights-foul-play-in-text-book-printing-by-bosem |title=Maoists highlights foul play in text book printing by BOSEM |work=Imphal Times |location=Imphal |date=9 July 2014 |accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCPM has alleged that Chingranglen Meitei, who was working as the [[General Secretary]] of the party was ferret out and arrested by a squad of the Indian armed forces, while he was approaching towards his comrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manipurtimes.com/news-article/the-peoples-chronicle-brief-news/item/9201-mcpm-gen-secy-arrested |title=MCPM gen secy arrested |publisher=Manipur Times |location=Imphal |accessdate=9 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714152548/http://www.manipurtimes.com/news-article/the-peoples-chronicle-brief-news/item/9201-mcpm-gen-secy-arrested |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 2014, the MCPM released an official statement that the party was not being able to trace Chingranglen Meitei since the time of his alleged abduction [by Indian personnel], and has no clue about his "whereabouts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nagalandpost.com/channelnews/regional/RegionalNews.aspx?news=TkVXUzEwMDA2MDA3Mg%3D%3D |title=MCPM general secretary remained untraceable |newspaper=Nagaland Post |location=Imphal |date=21 May 2014 |accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Military Commission===
The MCPM structured the party's [[Central Military Commission]] (CMC) on 21 September 2012, and Taibanglen Meitei is also the CMC's chairperson.&lt;ref name="IT-NPM"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://imphaltimes.com/maoist-communist-party-greets-people-first-anniversary-npm/ |archiveurl=http://archive.imphaltimes.com/maoist-communist-party-greets-people-first-anniversary-npm/ |title=Maoist Communist Party greets people on the first anniversary of NPM |work=Imphal Times |location=Imphal |date=21 September 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2014 |archivedate=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party believes that despite of being at the "initial stage," it is still "capable of launching offensives in mobile," and is looking forward to raise the NPM's strength, eyeing to "effectively launch positional war with the enemy [Indian [[State (polity)|State]]]."&lt;ref name="MT–3266"/&gt;

==Legal status==
The MCPM is a banned organisation.&lt;ref name="IT-MayDay"/&gt;

==Relations with other insurgents==
The [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]] has termed the establishment of MCPM as "an event of historical significance in the annals of the history of revolution in South-Asia" and has stated that "it would fight shoulder to shoulder with them [MCPM] in the fight against the common enemy – the Indian [[State (polity)|State]]."&lt;ref name="IT-CC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://imphaltimes.com/central-committee-cpi-maoist-acknowledge-maoist-communist-party-of-manipur-existence-it-news-imphal-may-3-the-central-committee-cpi-maoist-extends-its-heartfelt-revolutionary-greetings-to-the/ |archiveurl=http://archive.imphaltimes.com/central-committee-cpi-maoist-acknowledge-maoist-communist-party-of-manipur-existence-it-news-imphal-may-3-the-central-committee-cpi-maoist-extends-its-heartfelt-revolutionary-greetings-to-the/ |title=Central Committee, CPI (Maoist) acknowledge Maoist Communist Party of Manipur existence |work=Imphal Times |location=Imphal |date=3 May 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2014 |archivedate=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPI (Maoist) had also maintained close ties with the KCP (Maoist) and the [[People's Liberation Army of Manipur]] in the past.&lt;ref name="ToI-10016542"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shillong"/&gt; The KCP (Maoist), in November 2010, pledged "support" to "Indian Maoists."&lt;ref name="eToI"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lite.epaper.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&amp;pageid=8&amp;edlabel=TOIKM&amp;mydateHid=18-09-2011&amp;pubname=&amp;edname=&amp;articleid=Ar00801&amp;format=&amp;publabel=TOI |title=NE rebels embrace Maoist ideology |first=Caesar |last=Mandal |location=Kolkata |publisher=[[Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

==Election boycott==
The MCPM [[boycott]]ed the [[Manipur Legislative Assembly election, 2012]] and banned "all election related functions" in the state because the party believed that the "assembly elections in Manipur would never bring welfare to the people nor bring any development" and would just amplify the "Indian system of rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.samachar.com/maoist-communist-party-manipur-boycotts-general-election-lm2iM5bggea.html |title=Maoist Communist Party Manipur boycotts general election |work=Imphal Free Press |publisher=Sify |date=26 December 2011 |accessdate=13 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140615083258/http://www.samachar.com/maoist-communist-party-manipur-boycotts-general-election-lm2iM5bggea.html |archivedate=15 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the MCPM called for a "political strike" in Manipur&lt;ref name="NP"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nagalandpost.com/channelnews/regional/RegionalNews.aspx?news=TkVXUzEwMDA1NzM5MA%3D%3D |title=MCPM announces 'political strike' to boycott LS polls |newspaper=[[Nagaland Post]] |date=2 April 2014 |accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and boycotted the [[Indian general election, 2014 (Manipur)|Indian general election, 2014 in the state]], saying that "the Indian election is not needed." The ban imposed on the Indian general election, 2014 in Manipur by the MCPM along with the United Revolutionary Front, and the Kuki National Army (Indian) affected the [[political campaigning]] of the candidates, and they had to drop their door–to–door campaign while several candidates avoided to visit their [[constituencies]] as a violent armed action was expected beyond doubt if "electioneering" would have been attempted in Manipur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/candidates-unable-to-campaign-despite-protection/article5853238.ece |title=Candidates unable to campaign despite protection |first=Iboyaima |last=Laithangbam |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |location=Imphal |date=31 March 2014 |accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCPM had urged its comrades to closely and alertly monitor the electoral campaign of the political parties and their contestants, and to execute strategies to pester the election process while avoiding to engender inconvenience to the people.&lt;ref name="NP"/&gt;

A '''military operation plan''' (also called a '''war plan''' before [[World War II]]) is a formal [[plan]] for [[military|military armed forces]], their [[military organization]]s and units to conduct operations, as drawn up by commanders within the [[combat operations process]] in achieving objectives before or during a [[war|conflict]]. Military plans are generally produced in accordance with the [[military doctrine]] of the troops involved.

[[Plan XVII]] and the [[Schlieffen Plan]] are examples of [[World War I]] military plans. The [[United States]] developed a famous color-coded set of war plans in the early 20th century; see [[United States color-coded war plans]].

Military plans often have [[code name]]s.

==United States==

In the [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]], an Operation Plan (OPLAN) is a complete and detailed plan for conducting [[joint warfare|joint]] military operations.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Publication 5-0.  ''[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp5_0.pdf Joint Operation Planning]''. 26 December 2006. Accessed 21 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  An OPLAN is developed by the Combatant Commander (CCDR) of a [[Unified Combatant Command]] in response to actual or potential situations for which military operations may be required.  An OPLAN is executed when the commander issues an [[operations order]] (OPORD), or when the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (CJCS) issues an execute order (EXORD) at the direction of the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] (Secdef) to implement a decision by the [[President of the United States|President]] to initiate military operations.  A concept plan (CONPLAN) is an operation plan in concept form, often lacking the level of details normally found in other military plans.

Among publicly known U.S. Operations Plans are two which address possible events on the Korean Peninsula, [[OPLAN 5027]], the U.S. general war plan which has been regularly updated since at least the mid-1990s, and [[OPLAN 5029]], a plan catering to a sudden collapse of the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]].  [[OPLAN 8044]] and [[OPLAN 8010]] are both successor plans to the [[Single Integrated Operational Plan]], the general plan for nuclear war from 1961 to 2003.  [[U.S. Central Command OPLAN 1003-98|OPLAN 1003-98]] was the pre-2002 plan for war with [[Iraq]].

==North Atlantic Treaty Organization==
In [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]] the successful planning of multinational military operations requires common doctrine. This doctrine is documented in Allied Joint Publication (AJP) five, which is aimed primarily at those engaged in operational-level planning, specifically commanders and staffs employed in joint force command headquarters and component command headquarters. It describes the fundamental aspects of planning joint operations at the operational level and provides an overarching framework of the key planning principles, considerations and process steps that are followed in operational-level planning.&lt;ref name="AJP5"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/ap/AJP-5%20E.pdf |title=Allied Joint Publication 5 - Allied Joint Doctrine for Operational-Level Planning |date=June 2013|publisher=NATO|access-date=21 May 2017|ID=AJP-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see|All India Muslim League|Muslim League (Pakistan)|Pakistan Muslim League}}
The '''Muslim League''' was established as a [[Muslim]] representative political party in [[British Raj|British India]], originally as the [[All India Muslim League]]. The All India Muslim League was the driving force behind the [[Pakistan Movement]], which resulted in the founding of [[Pakistan]]. After independence of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, it was originally succeeded by the [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]] which ruled the country for its first 11 years. The [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]] was later disbanded by Pakistan's first martial law. Another "Muslim League", the [[Pakistan Muslim League]], was later raised by [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] in 1962. The Pakistan Muslim League has since split into many factions over the years.

The party, which was initially set up in 1906 to look after the political interests of the Muslims of India, finally spearheaded the struggle for a separate homeland for them. Despite its success, the League suffered from two major weaknesses: lack of a well-defined social and economic programme, and lack of a strong party organisation.

== Schisms in the Muslim League ==
Pakistan has an unstable party system and there is a tendency among political parties to divide into factions. Because in a multi-ethnic state like Pakistan political parties are the ultimate expression of democracy, internal rifts in them have largely contributed to political instability in the country.

The first faction was created when [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami Muslim League]] was founded in [[Dhaka]], the erstwhile capital of the Pakistani province of [[East Pakistan]], in 1949  by Bengali nationalists [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], [[Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani]] and [[Shamsul Huq]]. The Awami Muslim League was established as the Bengali alternative to the domination of the [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]] in Pakistan. The party quickly gained massive popular support in [[East Pakistan]], and eventually led the forces of [[Bengali nationalism]] in the struggle against [[West Pakistan]]'s military and political establishment.

Of all political parties in Pakistan, the Pakistan Muslim League has been most susceptible to fragmentation. It is a party whose fate has largely been controlled by outside forces rather than the party leadership or the people. In fact making and breaking of the League has been an important part of the establishment’s power strategy. Hence, not surprisingly, the League or a faction thereof remains united only when it is in power and lately the PPP-P under Zardari has become similar in many respects to the old [[Convention Muslim League|Convention ML]].

The '''National Security Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan''' ('''NSC''') is an intelligence agency in [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name="CACI"/&gt; It was founded on 13 July 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.knb.kz/page.php?page_id=72&amp;lang=2&amp;article_id=3437&amp;fontsize=12&amp;fontfamily=Times%20New%20Roman&amp;page=1|title=Adequately react to modern threats|publisher=National Security Committee|publication-place=Kazakhstan|date=2007-07-13|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The NSC was created in accordance with a law passed by parliament in July 1992 which authorised the establishment of an agency to replace the [[KGB]], the old national security apparatus of the [[Soviet Union]]. Initially, it retained most of the staff which the KGB had employed in Kazakhstan, as well as the powers the KGB had held; its first head, [[Bulat Baekenov]], had worked for the KGB for over two decades. Its early years were marked by close cooperation with Russia on issues of border security and counter-intelligence against alleged foreign spies.&lt;ref name="Knight161"/&gt; In December 1995, a new presidential decree modified some of the NSC's powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Об органах национальной безопасности Республики Казахстан|periodical=Ведомости Верховного Совета Республики Казахстан|date=1995-12-21|volume=24|number=157|url=http://www.pavlodar.com/zakon/?dok=00070&amp;ogl=all|accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, journalist [[Ramazan Yesergepov]] published an article entitled "Who Rules the Country: President or National Security Committee?" It contained private NSC correspondence which was later listed as classified, resulting in his 2009 arrest and conviction on security charges.&lt;ref name="Ferghana20090111"&gt;{{citation|url=http://enews.fergananews.com/news.php?id=929|periodical=[[Ferghana Information Agency]]|title=Kazakhstan: Journalist Ramazan Yesergepov faces the prospect of spending the next 8 years behind the bars|date=2009-01-11|accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case led to domestic and international condemnation.&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes"&gt;{{citation|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2009652242_apaskazakhstanjailededitor.html|periodical=Seattle Times|date=2009-08-13|accessdate=2011-04-20|title=Kazakhstan court refuses to free jailed editor|last=Leonard|first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Daily Times of Pakistan|title=Rights group raps Kazakh record before OSCE summit|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010%5C12%5C01%5Cstory_1-12-2010_pg14_4|date=2010-12-01|accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Kazakhstani president [[Nursultan Nazarbaev]] appointed his nephew Samat Abish as the NSC's head of human resources; opposition lawmaker [[Serikbolsyn Abdildin]] of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] claimed this shows that Nazarbaev considers personal loyalty more important than skill in government posts.&lt;ref name="Nephew"/&gt;

By November 1997, about 1,772,000 cows had been slaughtered under the scheme, with compensation of 1 [[European Currency Unit|ecu]] per kg, reduced to .9 ecu in October 1996, and later to .8 ecu, and later still a 560&amp;nbsp;kg cap per animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1997/nov/26/over-30-months-scheme|speaker=Paul Keetch|date=26 November 1997|house=Commons|volume=301|col=1058|title=Over-30-months Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] reviewed the scheme in 2003, in view of the steps taken to date, and the introduction of EU testing and inspection regime in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/330_OverThirtyMonthsOTMRuleReview.html|title=Over Thirty Months (OTM) Rule Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul N. Franco''' (born 1956) is a professor of government at [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine]], and a leading authority on the British political philosopher [[Michael Oakeshott]].

Franco holds a B.A. from [[Colorado College]], where he studied under Oakeshott scholar [[Timothy Fuller]], an M.Sc. from the [[London School of Economics]], where he studied under Oakeshott himself, and a Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]], where his advisor was [[Joseph Cropsey]], a friend and disciple of the political philosopher [[Leo Strauss]]. Before Bowdoin, he taught at the University of Chicago as a William Rainey Harper Fellow.

Fuller called his book, ''[[The Political Philosophy of Michael Oakeshott]]'' (1990) the "only complete and current exposition"&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, Michael: Rationalism in Politics and Other Essays. Indiana: Libertyfund, 1991. pg. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; of Oakeshott so far. In ''[[The Conservative Soul, Fundamentalism, Freedom, and the Future of the Right]]'' (2006) blogger [[Andrew Sullivan]] referred to Franco as one of Oakeshott's "most insightful students."&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Andrew: Fundamentalism, Freedom, and the Future of the Right, pg. 225. New York: HarperCollins, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Franco's attempt to restore Hegel's place as an enlightenment philosopher ''[[Hegel's Philosophy of Freedom]]'' (2002) addresses a growing emphasis on Hegel's romanticism and historicism. Franco's Hegel book is now generally read alongside the work of other eminent Hegel scholars such as [[Robert Pippin]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Steven B. Smith (professor)|Steven Smith]], and [[Alexander Kojeve]]. Franco's current work focuses on Friedrich Nietzsche's middle works.

Franco's articles and reviews have appeared in ''The American Political Science Review'', ''Political Theory'', ''The Journal of Politics'', ''The Review of Politics'', ''Political Studies'', ''Ethics'', and ''The Political Science Reviewer''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Political philosophy==
''The Problem of Culture'': Professor Franco delivered the Karofsky Lecture at Bowdoin College on September 6, 2007. His lecture was entitled "Friedrich Nietzsche and Liberal Education" and in it he formulates the "Problem of Culture:"{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

''We have seen that Nietzsche’s fundamental solution to the problem was to posit the production of great human being or geniuses as the goal of education. Such a goal he thought would provide unity to an otherwise fragmentary culture, and meaning to the otherwise egoistic lives of individuals. It is in many ways a beguiling solution, but it is also deeply at odds with the fundamental presuppositions of 21st century American democracy. For this reason, it ultimately fails to carry conviction. Even Nietzsche himself changed his mind about the nature of the goal to be aimed at and his later philosophy is littered with figures, free-spirits, supermen, new philosophers, who were meant to fill the role originally attributed to the genius. Perhaps this is one of Nietzsche’s most enduring lessons—not his specific solutions he came up with, but the tireless quest to find a goal for culture and education in a world that had lost its traditional bearings, and was headed into the long twilight of nihilism. Though he may not have discovered a goal that we find compelling today, he brings home the danger, especially for education, of doing without any goal at all" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bowdoin.edu/podcasts/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Freedom after the Cold War'': Franco's work on Hegel seeks to overcome the dichotomy between positive and negative liberty as articulated by western political thinkers like Isaiah Berlin during the cold war.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

''Societas'' and ''universitas'': These two poles anchor Franco's thought. The former, as expressed by Oakeshott, refers to a "band of eccentrics" bound together by no common purposes. Universitas refers to a political order conceived as a people consecrated to a collective enterprise. Franco's work on Oakeshott leans towards the Societas understanding of politics whereas his recent works on Nietzsche lean towards a universitas conception of politics. He does not seem to think these two are mutually exclusive. One could say his project is trying to reconcile universitas and liberalism for the 21st century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4146">The '''People's Liberation Army General Political Department''' ('''GPD'''; {{zh|s=中国人民解放军总政治部}}) is the former chief political organ under the [[Central Military Commission]] of Communist Party of China. It leads all political activities in the [[People's Liberation Army]].

Its former director-generals include [[Liu Shaoqi]], [[Luo Ronghuan]], [[Tan Zheng]], [[Xiao Hua (PRC)|Xiao Hua]], [[Li Desheng]], [[Zhang Chunqiao]], [[Wei Guoqing]], [[Yu Qiuli]], [[Yang Baibing]], [[Yu Yongbo]], [[Xu Caihou]], and [[Li Jinai]]. Its last head was [[Zhang Yang (general)|Zhang Yang]], who committed suicide.

The department was disbanded in January 2016 and a new agency, the [[Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission]] was founded in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.cnr.cn/native/gd/20160115/t20160115_521144381.shtml |title = 国防部新闻事务局官微发布中央军委机关英文译名 |accessdate = 2016-01-15 |website = People's Daily Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the Cultural Revolution==
The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army played an important role for Mao Zedong during the [[Cultural Revolution]], through its control of "political departments" that were set up throughout the state apparatus.&lt;ref name="cambridge"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1964 before the Cultural Revolution, organizations called "political departments" were set up in throughout branches of the administration in China, in central and regional levels. Members were to study the works of Mao Zedong and emulate the army. These organizations were headed by the General Political Department, the organ by which [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Lin Biao]] exercised control over the armed forces. This made the economic "political department" also under command of the armed forces, rather than the Party's [[Central Committee]]. This effectively created a "parallel [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]" which bypassed the Party. The role of the GDP during the Cultural Revolution meant that when the Party lines of command failed amidst chaos, alternative chains of command would be implemented. By 1966, before the Cultural Revolution began, this system was effective.&lt;ref name=schurman&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The General Political Department was led by a director, usually of General rank, and numerous deputy directors, most of whom were also accorded General rank (others were Lt. Generals). The director was a military-region level position. The last director was [[Zhang Yang (general)|Zhang Yang]], who served until 2016 and became head of the Department's successor body.

The department also had a number of departments under it: the General Office, the Discipline Inspection Department, the Foreign Affairs Bureau General Office, the Justice Bureau General Office, Mass Work Bureau General Office, Cadre Department, Culture Department, Directly Subordinated Organs Work Department, Liaison Department, Organization Department, Propaganda Department, Security Department. The Department also oversees the [[Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution]], the ''[[PLA Daily]]'', the PLA Literature and Art Press (Kunlun Press), PLA Pictorial, and PLA Press.

The '''Rassemblement pour l'Indépendance Nationale''' ('''RIN''', in [[English language|English]]: Rally for National Independence) was a political organization dedicated to the promotion of [[Quebec]] national [[Quebec sovereignty movement|independence]] from [[Canada]].

==History==

It was founded on September 10, 1960,  by about 30 people at the very beginning of the  [[Quiet Revolution]]. The founders included many of former [[Alliance Laurentienne]] members. (The Alliance Laurentienne was dissolved after the creation of the RIN.) The founding members included [[André D'Allemagne]], [[Jacques Bellemare]] and [[Marcel Chaput]]. Other prominent members included [[Andrée Ferretti]], [[Hubert Aquin]] and [[Raymond Villeneuve]]. D'Allemagne, having participated in the Alliance Laurentienne, said that he had found the Alliance's [[right-wing]] tendencies quite unpleasant. This was a factor leading to the creation of an officially neutral organisation. However, as the RIN attracted many new young members it quickly became associated with more radical [[left-wing]] ideas.

In October 1960, the first general assembly of the organization published its manifesto calling for the independence of Quebec. [[Pierre Bourgault]], who had joined shortly after foundation, became its president in 1964. Following the wish of the members as expressed in a resolution in 1963, the RIN was turned into a political party. Bourgault and his impassioned, fiery speeches contributed largely to the popularity of the RIN, and is often wrongly believed to be the founder of the movement.

In 1963, Georges Schoeters, Raymond Villeneuve and Gabriel Hudon, ex-members of the RIN youth wing left the party to form the underground, revolutionary Front de Libération du Québec.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-in-quebec-sovereigntists-havent-found-an-argument-that-will/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Quebec general election, 1966|1966 Quebec general election]], the RIN, along with the [[Ralliement National]] (RN) won about 8.8% of the popular vote and no seats. Bourgault lost the northern [[Duplessis (electoral district)|Duplessis riding]] by a very small margin, a great accomplishment for such a [[third political party|third party]]. Although it never gathered a high number of votes Quebec-wide, it played an important role in the birth of the modern "[[Quebec sovereignism|indépendantiste]]" movement in Quebec and was very active in public demonstrations. Famous protests of the RIN include a 1964 demonstration disapproving the visit of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] to Quebec, and a 1968 protest about the presence of [[Pierre Trudeau]] on [[Fête nationale du Québec|Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day]] that turned to riot. Their members and supporters were also present in the [[Montreal]] crowd and their symbols visible when [[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] shouted his famed "[[Vive le Québec Libre speech|Vive le Québec Libre]]" (Long live free Quebec).

In October 1967, the charismatic [[Quebec Liberal Party]] [[National Assembly of Quebec|Member of the National Assembly]] and former cabinet minister [[René Lévesque]] left the Liberal Party when its members voted to not debate his idea of two independent but associated states (Quebec and Canada). Shortly after, the [[Mouvement Souveraineté-Association]] was founded with Lévesque as leader. The RIN quickly engaged in talks over a possible merger with the MSA. Bourgault and D'Allemagne strongly believed that the forces for Quebec independence had to unite to challenge the "old parties" (Liberals and [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]).

Bourgault and Lévesque started to clash, as Lévesque had come to distrust the RIN because of its perceived rowdy behaviour.  Additional opposition to the idea of a merger came from within the RIN itself; some militants (such as Andrée Ferretti) were heart-broken at the prospect of the "end" of their party. Ultimately, however, the desire for a strong independentist force carried the day. By 1968, the MSA came to an agreement with the Ralliement National to form the [[Parti Québécois]], deliberately excluding the RIN as an entity. The RIN's left wing split to form the [[Le front de libération populaire]] (FLP), and Bourgault dissolved the party and instructed members to join the PQ.

'''Resident Commissioner''' is the title of several, quite different types of [[Commissioner]] in overseas possession or protectorate of the British Crown or of the United States of America.

==The British Empire and the Commonwealth of Nations==
Resident Commissioners appointed by the British crown typically reside in the territorial unit of which they are in charge. This also the case with most otherwise styled Commissioners.

Notably in certain complex colonial units within the [[British Empire]], the [[High Commissioner]] to whom was given the highest 'regional' supervision (either residing in one of the constitutive territories, e.g. in the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT), first by the Governor on [[Fiji]], then from 1952 onwards on the Solomon Islands; or even in a neighbouring colony, e.g. the Governor of the [[Straits Settlements]] as High Commissioner for the [[Federated Malay States]]) would commonly be represented in territories not comprising his residence by a Resident Commissioner, though in some places (including some of the Federated Malay States) similar officials were formally styled as [[Resident (title)|Residents]], a more diplomatic title; otherwise another type of official was also possible (e.g. the British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] in the protected state of [[Tonga]], a Polynesian kingdom; an [[Administrator of the Government|Administrator]] on [[Nauru]]; a mere [[Chief Magistrate]] on tiny [[Pitcairn]]). In some cases one could compare his task to the Lieutenant-Governor of a minor colony, especially as the High Commissioner indeed could be a British colonial Governor doubling as such.

In the British Western Pacific Territories this was the case for:

*The [[British Solomon Islands]] from 1893 until they got a Governor (who also became the High Commissioner) in 1952.
* The [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] were administered as a British protectorate by a Resident Commissioner from 1892 to 1916 as part of the [[British Western Pacific Territories]] (BWPT), and from 1916 to 1974 as part of the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] colony.
* The [[Union Group]] protectorate from 1916, (later a separate state called Tokelau).
*The [[Cook Islands]], since the 11 June 1901 incorporation into New Zealand (previously there was a British Resident).
*[[Niue]] since 1901 (later under a High Commissioner) soon annexed to the dominion of [[New Zealand]] (1901-1904 as part of the [[Cook Islands]]) see  [[List of resident commissioners of Niue]]
*A special case were the [[New Hebrides]], for these were an Anglo-French colonial [[condominium]], so he had a French colleague styled [[Résident]], subordinate to France's ''Haut Commissaire'' (High Commissioner) in the Pacific Ocean (from 22 March 1907 the Governor of New Caledonia); both were abolished at the independence of the Republic of Vanuatu in 1980.

While the post of High Commissioner for Southern Africa (HCSA) was held 27 January 1847 - 31 May 1910 by the Governors of the [[Cape Colony]], then till 6 April 1931 by the Governors-General of the [[Union of South Africa|Union]] of [[South Africa]], after that date filled separately till 1963, there have been resident representatives in the constituent territories:

*In (British) [[Bechuanaland]], after a few Deputy - and Special Commissioners, there were Resident Commissioners since it was made dependent on the HCSA on 9 May 1891; in 1892-1923 there were also two [[Assistant Commissioner]]s, for the North and the South respectively.
*In the British [[Swaziland]] protectorate, since it was dependent on the HCSA in 1902 (before administered through [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], under an [[Administrator of the Government|Administrator]]); afterwards both got a separate Commissioner.
*From 18 March 1884 [[Basutoland]] became a separate colony, as one of the High Commission Territories, it got its Resident Commissioner, instead of a Cape [[Special agent|Government Agent]] (since it became a British protectorate in 1868).

==The Republic of India==
In [[India]], a Resident Commissioner is the representative of the State Government with an office in [[New Delhi]], who is also supposed to manage the reception of state government functionaries who visit New Delhi. He coordinates with various Ministries of the Central Government, Central PSUs, multi-lateral and bilateral agencies and various other organisations on behalf of the state government. he is an [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]] Officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://persmin.gov.in/DOPT_CitizenCorner_rc.asp List of Resident Commissioners of States / UTs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The United States of America==
*The [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico]] does not reside there but represents the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|U.S. commonwealth]] in the continental [[United States]], particularly in the capital of [[Washington, DC]]. The Resident Commissioner represents Puerto Rico in the [[United States House of Representatives]], where they have a status equivalent to a territorial delegate, as well as before executive departments.
*The [[Resident Commissioner of the Philippines]] held a similar position when the [[Philippines]] was a [[United States territory]] and then Commonwealth. The position was originally created by the [[Philippine Organic Act]] of 1902 with the first commissioners serving from 1905. The position ended with [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Philippine Independence]] in 1946.
*In most other U.S. overseas (and historically pre-state) territories, a similar representative position is styled [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Delegate]].

With respect to public companies in the United States, a '''shareholder resolution''' is a proposal submitted by [[shareholders]] for a vote at the company's annual meeting. Typically, resolutions are opposed by the corporation's management, hence the insistence for a vote. For publicly held corporations in the United States, the submission and handling of resolutions is regulated by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). 

[[Shareholders]] submit resolutions dealing primarily with [[corporate governance]], such as [[executive compensation]], or [[corporate social responsibility]] issues, such as [[global warming]], [[labor relations]], [[tobacco smoking]], [[human rights]], and animal welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/04/25/magazines/fortune/pluggedin_fortune/|title=FORTUNE Magazine: Corporate America backs gay rights|accessdate=2008-03-09 | work=CNN | date=April 25, 2006 | first=Marc | last=Gunther}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all shareholder resolutions are non-binding (or "precatory," to use the legal term of art).&lt;ref&gt;Monks, Robert A. and Nell Minow. ''Corporate Governance''. Blackwell Publishers, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the voting on these resolutions more closely resembles a poll than it does a (binding) [[referendum]] or [[plebiscite]]. Still, media coverage of voting on shareholder resolutions tends to focus on whether the proposal received a majority of votes, which occurs in a very small but increasing proportion of cases. According to SEC rules, defeated resolutions may be resubmitted only if they pass certain election hurdles (percentage of affirmative votes).  

Shareholder resolutions have been an important part of activist campaigns in several cases. For example, resolutions were effective at raising public awareness and thereby pressuring corporate management about investments in [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], [[nuclear power]], and [[labor disputes]]. Given these results, resolutions have been spearheaded by several coordinating groups, including the [[AFL-CIO]] and the [[Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility]]. Governmental and labor union [[pension funds]] also have become involved in supporting and submitting shareholder resolutions.

A shareholder resolution to protest napalm manufacturer Dow Chemical resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court case called SEC v. MEDICAL COMMITTEE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, 404 U.S. 403 (1972). The court decided that the case was moot due to Dow's agreeing to include the resolution on its proxy statement.&lt;ref name = scotus&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/404/403.html |title=Sec V. Medical Committee For Human Rights &amp;#124; Findlaw |publisher=Caselaw.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dissent argument by Justice Douglas encourages the SEC to facilitate more shareholder resolutions. "The philosophy of our times, I think, requires that such [404 U.S. 403, 410]  enterprises be held to a higher standard than that of the "morals of the marketplace" which exalts a single-minded, myopic determination to maximize profits as the traditional be-all and end-all of corporate concern." &lt;ref name = scotus/&gt;

===By Boko Haram===

{{See also|Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping}}

Apparently the first report of slave-taking by Boko Haram was on 13 May 2013 when a video was released of Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau saying his group had taken women and children - including teenage girls - hostage in response to the arrest of its members' wives and children.&lt;ref name=bbc-15-may-2015&gt;{{cite news|title=Boko Haram timeline: From preachers to slave raiders|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-22538888|accessdate=3 October 2015|agency=BBC News|date=15 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118120757/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-22538888|archive-date=2015-11-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Islamism expert [[Jonathan N.C. Hill]], Boko Haram began kidnapping large numbers of girls and young women for sexual use in 2014. The attacks echoed kidnappings of girls and young women for sexual use by Algerian Islamists in the 1990s and early 2000s, and may reflect influence by [[al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]].&lt;ref name="ctc.usma.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Jonathan N.C.|title=Boko Haram, the Chibok Abductions and Nigeria's Counterterrorism Strategy|journal=Combatting Terrorism Center at West Point|date=July 30, 2014|url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/boko-haram-the-chibok-abductions-and-nigerias-counterterrorism-strategy|accessdate=4 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904160609/https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/boko-haram-the-chibok-abductions-and-nigerias-counterterrorism-strategy|archive-date=2014-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marina Lazreg 2009 p. 47"&gt;Marina Lazreg, "Consequences of Political Liberalisation and Sociocultural Mobilisation for Women in Algeria, Egypt and Jordan," in Anne-Marie Goetz, Governing Women: Women's Political Effectiveness in Contexts of Democratisation and Governance Reform (New York: Routledge/UNRISD, 2009), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a community leader from Borno state quoted by the BBC, some captured young women and teenage girls held by Boko Haram have been forced to marry one Boko Haram fighter after another as the fighters are killed. "Any time they go for an operation and one of the fighters is killed they will force the young woman to marry another one ...

''[[The Economist]]'' reports that [[ISIS]] (also called "Islamic State") has taken "as many as 2,000 women and children" captive, selling and distributing them as sexual slaves.

In April 2015, [[Zainab Bangura]], the [[United Nations]] special envoy on sexual violence in conflict, visited Iraq and was given a copy of an Islamic State pamphlet including a list of prices for captured women and children.  According to a story on the list in Bloomberg, the list's authenticity "was established by UN researchers who'd gathered anecdotes on similar slave markets in Islamic State-controlled areas". The captives are non-Muslim minorities, "mostly Arab Christians and Yazidis" who have refused to convert to Islam and whose adult male relatives have been executed.

==History==
{{main|History of slavery in the Muslim world}}
In a study of the Arab slave trade from 650 C.E. to 1905 C.E., which considered human trafficking in North Africa, the Middle East, and India, Professor Ralph Austen estimates the number of slaves to be 17,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by John Ralph Willis. "Jihad and the ideology of enslavement", in Slaves and slavery in Muslim Africa— vol. 1. Islam and the ideology of enslavement, London, England; Totowa, N.J.: Frank Cass, 1985, p x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Female slavery was common during the medieval [[Arab slave trade]], where prisoners of war captured in battle from non-Arab lands often ended up as concubines (who are considered free when their master dies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml#section_7 |title=Islam and slavery: Sexual slavery |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624234057/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml#section_7 |archive-date=2017-06-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], some Muslim jurists writing on [[Islamic military jurisprudence|military jurisprudence]] advocated severe penalties for rebels who use "stealth attacks" and practise [[kidnapping|abductions]], poisoning of water wells, [[arson]], attacks against wayfarers and travellers, [[assault]]s under the cover of night and [[rape]].&lt;ref name = Fadl&gt;Abou El Fadl, Khaled. [Commentary: Terrorism Is at Odds With Islamic Tradition]. Muslim Lawyers&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, [[Winston Churchill]] wrote about the Islamic slave trade: "...all [of the Arab tribes in The Sudan], without exception, were hunters of men. To the great slave markets of Jeddah a continual stream of negro captives has flowed for hundreds of years. The invention of gunpowder and the adoption by the Arabs of firearms facilitated the traffic...Thus the situation in the Sudan for several centuries may be summed up as follows: The dominant race of Arab invaders was increasingly spreading its blood, religion, customs, and language among the black aboriginal population, and at the same time it harried and enslaved them...The warlike Arab tribes fought and brawled among themselves in ceaseless feud and strife. The negroes trembled in apprehension of capture, or rose locally against their oppressors."&lt;ref&gt;Winston Churchill. The River War, Vol. II, London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1899, pp. 248—50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lieber Code]] of 1863 codified the protection of civilians and stated that "all rape...[is] prohibited under the penalty of death"&lt;ref name="Askin_35_36"&gt;{{harvp|Askin|1997|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent [[Law of war|laws of war]] and [[humanitarian law]] have made maltreatment of civilians criminal.&lt;ref name="black book"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was formally abolished in nearly all countries in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Gordon.

Earlier in the 20th century, Islamist authors declared slavery outdated without actually clearly affirming and promoting its abolition.

According to some scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Abou El Fadl and William Clarence-Smith&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a  "reopening" of the issue of slavery by some conservative [[Salafi]] Islamic scholars after its "closing" earlier in the 20th century when [[Majority Muslim countries|Muslim countries]] banned slavery and "most Muslim scholars" found the practice "inconsistent with Qur'anic morality."&lt;ref&gt;Abou el Fadl, ''Great Theft'', HarperSanFrancisco, c2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/economicHistory/GEHN/GEHNPDF/Islam&amp;SlaveryWGCS.pdf |format=PDF |title=Islam and Slavery |first=William G. |last=Clarence-Smith |access-date=2018-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325013630/http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/economicHistory/GEHN/GEHNPDF/Islam%26SlaveryWGCS.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abul A'la Maududi]], the founder of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] has written: 

{{quote|Islam has clearly and categorically forbidden the primitive practice of capturing a free man, to make him a slave or to sell him into slavery. On this point the clear and unequivocal words of [Muhammad] are as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are three categories of people against whom I shall myself be a plaintiff on the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgement]]. Of these three, one is he who enslaves a free man, then sells him and eats this money" (al-Bukhari and Ibn Majjah).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The words of this Tradition of the Prophet are also general, they have not been qualified or made applicable to a particular nation, race, country or followers of a particular religion.....After this the only form of slavery which was left in Islamic society was the prisoners of war, who were captured on the battlefield. These prisoners of war were retained by the Muslim Government until their government agreed to receive them back in exchange for Muslim soldiers captured by them.....&lt;ref&gt;From "Human Rights in Islam" by 'Allamah Abu Al-'A'la Mawdudi.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women and children [are to be] divided according to the Shariah amongst the fighters of the Islamic State who participated in the Sinjar operations [in northern Iraq] … Enslaving the families of the kuffar [infidels] and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Shariah that if one were to deny or mock, he would be denying or mocking the verses of the Koran and the narrations of the Prophet … and thereby apostatizing from Islam.&lt;ref name=wood-2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=Graeme|title=What ISIS Really Wants|journal=The Atlantic|date=March 2015|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/|accessdate=26 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226023536/http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/|archive-date=2015-02-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Susannah Hagan, FRSA''' (born 1951) is the founding Director of R_E_D (Research into Environment + Design)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theredgroup.org|title=R_E_D The Red Group (Research into Environment + Design)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Professor and School Research Leader at the [[Royal College of Art]] School of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rca.ac.uk/Default.aspx?ContentID=515344|title=Royal College of Art, Research Leaders|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629114856/http://rca.ac.uk/Default.aspx?ContentID=515344|archivedate=29 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written and lectured extensively on the theory and practice of environmental design, in particular, environmentally led urban design. Hagan's major publications include ''City Fights: Debates on Sustainable Cities'' (James &amp; James (Science) Publishers, London, 2000); ''Taking Shape:  A New Contract between Architecture and Nature'' (Architectural Press, Oxford, 2001); and ''Digitalia: Architecture and the Environmental, the Digital and the Avant-garde'' (Routledge, London, 2008).

==Biography==
Hagan was born in London and raised in England and the United States. She studied English and French literature at [[Yale University]] in New Haven, Connecticut, receiving a Bachelor of Arts with Honors degree in 1973.  She then moved to New York City, where she attended the Graduate School of Architecture at [[Columbia University]], earning a Master of Architecture degree in 1978.  As part of her architectural studies, Hagan spent a year abroad as an exchange student at the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] in London.

Susannah Hagan moved from United States to London in 1991 to pursue her studies in architectural history and theory, first at the Architectural Association Graduate School and then at [[Birkbeck, University of London]].  In 1999, Hagan was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of London.  In 2002 and 2003, she pursued postdoctoral research at the [[University of Cambridge]], completing the Master of Philosophy Program in Environmental Design and Architecture.

She taught on the faculty of the Environment and Energy Masters Program at the Architectural Association from 1996 to 2002, and in 2002, was invited to set up a new Masters Program at the [[University of East London]]. The MA Architecture: Sustainability + Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uel.ac.uk/programmes/ava/postgraduate/sustainabilitydesign.htm|title=MA Architecture: Sustainability + Design, University of East London}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to completely integrate the relevant technology and social theory with design. From 2009 to 2011, Hagan was Professor of Urban Studies and Director of the Office of Spatial Research at the [[University of Brighton]].

Her work with R_E_D includes EMPTYing CITIES,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theredgroup.org/urban/emptying-cities/|title=EMPTYing CITIES|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504161442/http://www.theredgroup.org/urban/emptying-cities/|archivedate=4 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wuppertal, Germany, 2004–05, research-by-design into the problem of "shrinking cities," post-industrial cities losing population; EnLUDe 1 (Environmentally Led Urban DEsign), São Paulo, Brazil, 2005–07, a pilot research project with the LCAEE, University of São Paulo, involving environmentally led urban design on a large [[brownfield land|brownfield site]] earmarked for development by the city of São Paulo; and EnLUDe 2, Royal Docks, London, 2007–08, research-by-design into an environmentally led spatial planning on a high risk floodplain in the Thames Gateway.

In addition to her books on the relationship between environmental design and contemporary architecture and urban design, Hagan has also contributed to numerous others, including ''Nature, Landscape and Building for Sustainability''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/S/saunders_nature.html|title=''Nature, Landscape and Building for Sustainability,'' University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 2008.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 2008) and ''Ecological Urbanism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/en/catalogsearch/result?q=ecological+urbanism#ecological-urbanism-1|title=''Ecological Urbanism,'' Lars Müller Publishers, Baden, 2010.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Lars Müller Publishers, Baden, 2010), and to journals ranging from the [[Architectural Review]] to the [[Harvard Design Magazine]].  She has lectured internationally, including the Union of Baltic Cities Commission on Urban Planning, the annual NUTAU conference, São Paulo, the [[Moderna Museet]], Stockholm, and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London.

==Awards and recognition==
Hagan is a Fellow of the [[Institute for Urban Design]], New York, and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce]] (RSA), and a member of the International Development Network, the [[Royal Town Planning Institute]], and the Newham Borough Design Review Panel. Hagan was a finalist in the 2008/09 James Stirling Memorial Lecture Competition. In September 2010, "The Seed Catalogue, " an urban design competition entry submitted by Hagan, Silvio Caputo, and Mark Gaterell, was premiated in the international Integrated Habitats Design Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihdc.org.uk|title=Integrated Habitats Design Competition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Transitional Government of Ethiopia''' ('''TGE''') was established immediately after the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF) seized power from the Communist-led [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] (PDRE) in 1991 and it continued until 1995, when it transitioned into the reconstituted Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, which continues to this time. [[Meles Zenawi]] was the president and [[Tamrat Layne]] the prime minister of the Transitional Government.

In May 1991 the EPRDF drove the PDRE, led by [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], from power in [[Ethiopia]]. The EPRDF convened a National Conference from 1 July to 5 July and the Conference adopted a National Charter, which served as an interim constitution and established the Transitional Government. The Charter created the posts of president and prime minister, an 87-member Council of Representatives and a 17-member multi-ethnic Council of Ministers. The Council of Representatives was to elect the president, and oversee transition to a permanent government, which was expected to be created in 1994. A commission was to be created to draft a new constitution to come into effect by early 1994, two and a half years later.&lt;ref name=LOC_pxxvii4&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Ofcansky |editor1-first=Thomas P. |editor2-last=Berry |editor2-first=LaVerle |date=1993 |title=Country profile: Ethiopia |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/cs/profiles/Ethiopia.pdf |location= |publisher=[[Federal Research Division]], [[Library of Congress]] |pages=xxvii–xxviii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Constituent Assembly was [[Ethiopian Constituent Assembly election, 1994|elected in 1994]] to draw up a new [[Constitutions of Ethiopia|constitution for Ethiopia]]. [[Ethiopian general election, 1995|A general election]] was held in May–June 1995 and [[1995 Constitution of Ethiopia|the new constitution]] took effect on 21 August 1995, ending the period of transition. The constitution adopted the name "Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia" for the country. It also formalised the democratic federal structure,&lt;ref name=Vaughan27/&gt; replacing the provinces with the ethnically based regions, similar to how [[India]] formed [[States of India|its states]] soon after independence. Meles became prime minister of the Federal Democratic Republic and remained so until his death on August 20, 2012.

The '''Union Party''' was a short-lived [[political party]] in the [[United States]], formed in 1936 by a coalition of radio priest Father [[Charles Coughlin]], old-age [[pension]] advocate [[Francis Townsend]], and [[Gerald L. K. Smith]], who had taken control of [[Huey Long]]'s [[Share Our Wealth]] (SOW) movement after Long's assassination in 1935. Each of those people hoped to channel their wide followings into support for the Union Party, which proposed a [[populism|populist]] alternative to the [[New Deal]] reforms of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during the [[Great Depression]].

The party nominated a ticket consisting of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[William Lemke]] and labor attorney [[Thomas C. O'Brien]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936 presidential election]]. Running against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Alf Landon]], Roosevelt won a second term with over 60% of the popular vote, while Lemke won just under 2% of the popular vote. The Union Party collapsed after the 1936 elections. Lemke served as a Republican Congressman until his death in 1950, while Coughlin and Townsend receded from national politics. Smith later founded the [[Christian Nationalist Crusade]] and became a prominent proponent of [[Holocaust denial]].

==Background==
Many observers at the time felt that there was a place for a party more radical than Roosevelt and the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] but still non-[[Marxism|Marxist]] in the political spectrum of the time.

===Rumored political aspirations of Huey Long===
Although many people expected Huey Long, the colorful Democratic senator from Louisiana, to run as a third-party candidate with his "Share Our Wealth" program as his platform, his bid was cut short when he was assassinated in September 1935.

It was later suggested by historian and Long biographer [[T. Harry Williams]] that the senator had never, in fact, intended to run for the presidency in 1936. Instead, Williams argued that Long had been planning with Father Charles Coughlin, a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]] and populist [[talk radio]] personality, to run someone else on the soon-to-be-formed Share Our Wealth Party ticket. According to Williams, the idea was that this candidate would split the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] vote with President Roosevelt, thereby electing a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] president and proving the electoral appeal of SOW. Long would then wait four years and run for president as a Democrat in 1940. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Prior to Long's death, leading contenders for the role of the sacrificial 1936 candidate included [[United States Senate|Senators]] [[Burton K. Wheeler]] (D-Montana) and [[William Edgar Borah|William E. Borah]] (R-Idaho), and [[Governor of Minnesota|Governor]] [[Floyd B. Olson]] (FL-Minnesota). After the assassination, however, the two senators lost interest in the idea (Borah ran as a Republican, garnering only a few delegates and losing the nomination to Kansas governor [[Alf Landon]]) and Olson was diagnosed with terminal [[stomach cancer]].

==Problems and controversies==
The Union Party suffered from a multiplicity of problems almost from the moment of its inception.  A primary one was that each of the party's three principal leaders seemingly saw himself, not its [[President of the United States|presidential]] nominee [[William Lemke]], as the real power figure and natural leader of the party. His charisma attracted more people than did the other candidates.  Another was that each man's movement was largely held together by personality more than a truly cohesive ideology: in the case of Coughlin and Townsend their own personalities; in the case of Smith, the memory of the late Huey Long's charismatic personality. Smith himself was considered a far less charismatic figure. Some critics charged that the Union Party was in fact controlled by Father Coughlin, a former Roosevelt supporter who had broken with Roosevelt and by 1936 had become an [[antisemite]]. Smith had also turned to antisemitism, which was not consistent with the views of Long, Townsend, and Lemke, and reduced the appeal of the group among many [[progressivism|progressives]].

The Union Party attracted modest support from populists on both sides of the political spectrum who were unhappy with Roosevelt and from the remnants of earlier third parties such as the [[Farmer-Labor Party]].  Others such as ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' magazine were wary of the new party and backed Roosevelt.  Presaging more recent debates over the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]], the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]], [[H. Ross Perot]], and [[Ralph Nader]], some falsely considered the party either a left-wing [[Spoiler effect|spoiler]] party which would hurt Roosevelt, or an unworkable alliance between left-wing and right-wing populists.  More traditional parties on the left such as the [[United States Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] denounced the Union Party.

==1936 presidential nominee==
[[William Lemke]], a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] from [[North Dakota]], was chosen as the party's nominee for the [[U.S. presidential election, 1936|1936 presidential election]]. Lemke received 892,378 votes nationwide, or less than 2 percent of the total popular vote, and no electoral votes. However, even this meager showing was among the best for a U.S. [[third political party|third party]] between the 1924 Progressives and the 1948 [[Dixiecrat]]s, although, according to Svend Petersen's "A Statistical History of the American Presidential Elections", Norman Thomas' percentage in 1932 was 2.23 percent. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The vice-presidential nominee was [[Thomas C. O'Brien]], a labor lawyer from Boston.

==Other notable candidates==
[[Jacob S. Coxey]] of [[Coxey's Army]] fame, socialist leader and frequent independent candidate for the [[United States Congress]], ran for Congress in 1936 on the Union Party ticket in [[Election Results, U.S. Representative from Ohio, 16th District|Ohio's 16th District]].  He received 2,384 votes or 1.6% of the vote (4th place).

==Demise ==
The Union Party was disbanded shortly after the 1936 elections.  Presidential nominee Lemke continued to serve in Congress as a Republican, and died in office while serving an eighth term.  Father Coughlin announced his retirement from the airwaves immediately after the disappointing returns of the 1936 election, but returned to the air within a couple of months; upon U.S. entry into [[World War II]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]] ordered Father Coughlin to retire from the airwaves and return to his duties as a parish priest, and he died in obscurity in 1979. Townsend, already quite elderly, saw his movement largely supplanted by the enactment of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] the next year and also largely became quite obscure afterwards, although he lived until 1960.  Smith became even more of a radical fringe figure who eventually became an early proponent of [[Holocaust denial]]. He died in 1976.

== Other namesakes==

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]] the Republican Party of incumbent President [[Abraham Lincoln]] ran as the "National Union Party" or "Union Party". The name was a reference to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] faction of the [[American Civil War]]. Coughlin took the Union label for his own party, comparing the "financial slavery" of the 1930s to the "physical slavery" of the 1860s.&lt;ref name="kazin1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kazin|first1=Michael|title=The Populist Persuasion: An American History|date=29 October 1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=124–125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GJSbW1IT4WgC&amp;dq=thomas+c+o%27brien+union+party&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]], [[John B. Anderson]]'s independent bid for the presidency against [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] was in many states run on the party ballot line of the "National Union Party".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20001218/pollitt; Pollitt, Katha, "Down for the Count", The Nation] (December 16, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson won 6.6% of the popular vote and no electoral votes.

The '''Vice State President of South Africa''' was a position established between 1981 and 1984. [[Alwyn Schlebusch]] was the only holder of the position.

The position was created under constitutional reforms in 1981, which abolished the [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]], and created a President's Council, chaired by the Vice State President, to advise on the drafting of a new constitution. The post was abolished when the [[South African Constitution of 1983|1983 Constitution]] came into effect, combining the ceremonial post of [[State President of South Africa|State President]] with that of [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]], to create an executive post, with only provision for an Acting State President.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wIURAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Vice+State+President%22+%22South+Africa%22+1984&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Vice+State+President%22+ ''Constitutional Development of South Africa''], D. Marais, Macmillan South Africa, 1985, page 65&lt;/ref&gt;  

The executive position of [[Deputy President of South Africa]] was established in 1994.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7743">A '''voting advice application''' or '''voting aid application''' ('''VAA''') or '''vote matcher'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.votematch.eu&lt;/ref&gt; or '''vote compass''' or '''election compass''' is a Web application that helps voters find a candidate or a party that stands closest to their preferences. VAAs are a new phenomenon in modern election campaigning.

In some of the countries with popular VAAs an intense debate has broken out. Some maintain that VAAs are a fraud that can never give correct and neutral voting advice. Others contend that these applications must be commended as they focus people’s attention on the party programmes and on policy issues, compelling parties to discuss substance instead of [[Campaign advertising|personalities, images and campaign events]].

A study of VAAs by the [[University of Antwerp]] ends with a plea for a careful selection of VAA statements and for a proper process of benchmarking based on survey data. Without appropriate calibrating VAAs produce invalid results.

VAA questionnaires should be completed by the candidate or party for maximum accuracy, but also VAAs completed by the journalist are published, with supposed positions taken from party programmes and debates.

==Usage==
In 2007, of 22 European countries, 15 had at least one VAA. Some of the most successful ones were the Dutch [[Stemwijzer]] with 4.7 million consultations in 2006 (40% of the electorate) and the German [[Federal Agency for Civic Education#Voting advice|Wahl-O-Mat]] with 6.7 million consultations in 2009 (12% of the electorate).&lt;ref name="Grazia"&gt;Garzia, D.: "The Effects of VAAs on Users’ Voting Behaviour: An Overview", in Cedroni, L. &amp; Garzia, D. (eds.):[https://www.academia.edu/281395/Voting_Advice_Applications_in_Europe_The_State_of_the_Art ''Voting Advice Applications in Europe: The State of the Art''], Napoli: ScriptaWeb, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Research showed that usage was higher in countries with [[Proportional representation|proportional electoral systems]] and a larger number of parliamentary political parties, including Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Cedroni, Lorella: "Voting Advice Applications in Europe: A Comparison" in Cedroni, L. &amp; Garzia, D. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, the VotingAid phenomenon has even produced a little rivalry between the most popular news channels and voters eagerly compare the results between different VAA's. Out of Finland's electorate of 4,3 million, it is reported that over 20% of them found voting advice{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}  on the most popular VAA, launched by MTV3&lt;ref&gt;[[MTV3]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Effects on voting behaviour==
Empirical research has indicated three ways in which voting behavior can be influenced by VAAs: by motivating users to engage in further research about party policies, motivating participation in the election and affecting vote intentions. A 2005 survey in Germany reported that more than half of the VAA users declared to have been motivated to do further research after taking the test. The effect of motivating participation has been confirmed by several surveys, and quantified as 22% in the 2003 elections in Finland, 8% in the 2005 elections in Germany elections and 12% in the 2003 elections in the Netherlands. The proportion of voters declaring to have changed their preferences as result of VAA has been 3% in Finland, 6% in Germany and 10% in the Netherlands, however a post-election survey conducted in Belgium showed only 1% actual change.&lt;ref name="Grazia" /&gt; The floating, undecided voters, however, have received a lot more help by VAA's. In a study conducted in Finland, three out of four voters say that the VAA has some effect on their voting decision. VAA helps one person out of four to make the decision straight based on the VAA's results.

==Benefits for democracy==
Although the help that voters receive from VAA is proven to be great, it is not the only benefit that VAA's produce. Most of the VAA's collect and save the data given by users anonymously and that way they are able to create reports that show the overall opinion of that country's political status. Some of VAA tools are more sophisticated in the reporting, and they can generate automatically many kind of different reports such as average distribution reports, comparisons between parties or voter groups and between voters and candidates. These different reporting methods help for example media channels to create interesting news and raise topics of conversation in debates. The best case of democracy-making is to have the candidates answer personally on VAA's statements. This way the VAA automatically generates full see-through to the politics, everyone can see what the candidates think. Changing your opinions is a lot harder when your answers on hot political topics are in public for everyone to see.

==Election Compass USA==
Election Compass USA,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119939661834265699?mod=special_page_campaign2008_rightbox Wall Street Journal: 'Welcome to the Election Compass']&lt;/ref&gt; developed in cooperation with the [[Wall Street Journal]], was presented on January 2, 2008. Election Compass USA provides information about the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US presidential elections]]. Within 3 weeks 1 million people visited Election Compass USA. At the end of the campaign, up to 3.8 million people used the website to obtain information about the candidates.

==Israel Election Compass==
In collaboration with the [[Israel Democracy Institute]] a compass was developed for the Israeli [[Knesset]] elections of 2009. Over 40.000 voters visited the website in the first hour after launch alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727122451/http://www.idi.org.il/sites/english/ResearchAndPrograms/elections09/Pages/PressReleaseElectionCompass.aspx Israel Democracy Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Around election day, a total number of 600.000 people visited the compass.

==EU Profiler==
Together with the [[European University Institute]] and the Swiss [[Smartvote]], Election Compass created the [[EU Profiler]], a voting advice website for the [[European Parliament election, 2009|European Parliament election]] in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2567">The '''West Africa Commission on Drugs''' was launched by the [[Kofi Annan Foundation]] in 2014. [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] chaired the commission.

Obasanjo urged strengthening law enforcement and refocussing efforts on "high-level criminals rather than the easy – and misleading – wins gained by arresting drug users and petty dealers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Africa needs to wake up to threat from drugs trade |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/jun/26/west-africa-illegal-drugs-new-approach |accessdate=20 October 2018 |publisher=Guardian |date=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It produced a report “[http://www.wacommissionondrugs.org/wacd-documents/ Not Just in Transit: Drugs, the State and Society in West Africa]” which was launched in [[Dakar]], Senegal on 11 September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Civil Society workshop on drug policy opens|url=http://www.businessghana.com/portal/news/index.php?op=getNews&amp;id=202804|accessdate=24 February 2015|agency=Business Ghana|publisher=GNA|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report urged West African governments to overhaul their drug laws to decriminalise personal use and prioritise treatment.   Abuse of opioids, particularly [[Tramadol]] has become a major health crisis in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olusegun Obasanjo urges West Africa to decriminalise drugs |url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/africa/2018-09-11-olusegun-obasanjo-urges-west-africa-to-decriminalise-drugs/ |accessdate=20 October 2018 |publisher=Times Live |date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The commission proposed a detailed Model Drug Law which would end all criminal penalties relating to personal drug use and possession. This would allow law enforcement efforts to focus on unauthorised drug production and trafficking offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Expert Group Publish Blueprint for West Africa Drug Decriminalisation |url=https://www.talkingdrugs.org/expert-group-publish-blueprint-for-west-africa-drug-decriminalisation |accessdate=20 October 2018 |publisher=Talking drugs |date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is suggested that Ghana may become the first Sub-Saharan country to decriminalise personal drug use and possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Africa reform agenda looks to decriminalise drug use |url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2017-08-09-west-africa-reform-agenda-looks-to-decriminalise-drug-use/ |accessdate=20 October 2018 |publisher=Daily Maverick |date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union}}

'''Withdrawal from the Eurozone''' denotes the process whereby a [[Eurozone#Member states|Eurozone member-state]], whether voluntarily or forcibly, stops using the [[Euro]] as its [[national currency]] and leaves the [[Eurozone]].

==Background==
The possibility of a member state leaving the Eurozone was first raised after the onset of the [[Greek government-debt crisis]]. The term "[[Greek withdrawal from the eurozone|Grexit]]" itself was reportedly&lt;ref name=ft&gt;"[http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2012/02/07/870781/grexit/ Grexit]" by Kate Mackenzie and Joseph Cotterill, ''[[Financial Times]]'' Alphaville, 7 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; first used by [[Citigroup]] economists [[Willem Buiter]] and Ebrahim Rahbari in a 2012 report about the possibility of [[Greek withdrawal from the eurozone|Greece leaving the Eurozone]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://willembuiter.com/Citi44.pdf Rising Risks of Greek Euro Area Exit]" by Willem Buiter &amp; Ebrahim Rahbari, ''[[Citigroup]]'', 6 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015 edition, the term "Grexit" entered the [[Oxford Dictionary]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/28/2015/grexit-brexit-added-oxford-english-dictionary-whats-next Grexit, Brexit Added to Oxford English Dictionary; What's Next?]" by Antonia Oprita, ''Real Money'', 28 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; defined as "a term for the potential withdrawal of Greece from the [[Eurozone]], the economic region formed by those countries in the [[European Union]] that use the [[euro]] as their [[national currency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/grexit Grexit]: definition, Oxford Dictionaries website&lt;/ref&gt; 

Speculation followed about other countries as well, such as Italy, withdrawing from the Eurozone,&lt;ref name=roubini&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8887896/Debt-crisis-as-it-happened-November-11-2011.html Debt crisis: as it happened]", ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 11 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; with economist [[Nuriel Roubini]] submitting that "Italy may, like other [[periphery countries]] [of the Eurozone], need to exit the euro and go back to a [[national currency]], thus triggering an effective break-up of the Eurozone."&lt;ref name=roubini/&gt;

As of July 2018, no country has withdrawn from the Eurozone.

==Legal environment==
The prevailing legal opinion&lt;ref name=noone&gt;[https://euobserver.com/news/113563 "Brussels: No one can leave the euro"] by Leigh Phillips, ''[[EUobserver]]'', 8 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=locke&gt;"[http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a92664b9-d267-4347-a59a-6488ab3895fb The Eurozone crisis – the final stage?]" by Charles Proctor, [[Locke Lord]], 15 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; is that there is no provision in any European Union treaty for an exit from the Eurozone. In fact, it has been argued, the Treaties make it clear that the process of [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|monetary union]] was intended to be "irreversible" and "irrevocable."&lt;ref name=locke/&gt; However, in 2009, a [[European Central Bank]] legal study argued that, while voluntary withdrawal is legally not possible, expulsion remains "conceivable."&lt;ref name=ecblegal&gt;"[https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp10.pdf Withdrawal and Expulsion from the EU and EMU : Some reflections]" by Phoebus Athanassiou, Principal Legal Counsel with the [[Directorate-General for Legal Service]], [[European Central Bank|ECB]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although an explicit provision for an exit option does not exist, many experts and politicians in Europe, have suggested an option to leave the Eurozone should be included in the relevant treaties.&lt;ref name=activ&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-priorities-2020/news/german-advisory-council-calls-for-exit-option-in-the-eurozone/ "German advisory council calls for exit option in the eurozone"] by Daniel Tost, [[EurActiv]], 29 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Other analysts&lt;ref name=mar&gt;"[https://acelg.blogactiv.eu/2013/03/22/how-to-exit-the-eurozone/ How to exit the Eurozone?]" by Marijn van der Sluis, 22 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; have submitted that there are basically three ways of exiting the Eurozone: by leaving and subsequently rejoining the EU, whereby a renewed membership in the European Union would be possible only when economic convergence had been achieved; through a Treaty amendment; or through a [[European Council]] decision. The amendment would involve an extension of Article 50&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_VI:_Final_Provisions#Article_50 Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title VI: Final Provisions]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Treaty on European Union|European Treaty]] that would set out the process for exiting the euro.

A decision by the European Council would "probably" have to be [[Unanimity|unanimous]] and "with the consent of the [[European Parliament]]." It would state that a [[Eurozone]] member-state "will no longer be part of the Eurozone" and will become a member-state "with a [[derogation]]", by withdrawing the [[Council]]'s earlier decision for that state's entry into the Eurozone. Article 139&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Title_VIII:_Economic_and_Monetary_Policy#Article_139 Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title VIII: Economic and Monetary Policy]&lt;/ref&gt; regulates the terms of this "derogation":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Member States in respect of which the Council has not decided that they fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro shall hereinafter be referred to as 'Member States with a derogation'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The competence of the Council to retract its earlier decision would "possibly" invoke the argument that a given competence to decide on a matter always includes the competence to retract that decision.&lt;ref name=mar/&gt; Additionally, this retractile power can be derived from the "flexibility clause" of article 352 TFEU, which grants the Council, on a proposal from the [[European Commission|Commission]] and with the consent of the [[European Parliament]], the ability to [[Unanimity|unanimously]] adopt the "appropriate measures" to attain one of the objectives set out in the Treaties as set out in Article 3 of the European Union – essentially ascertaining that staying in the Eurozone would be so "devastating" for the well-being of the people of the member-state, and/or the rest of the peoples of Europe, that an exit would be legitimate in light of the Treaties' objectives. Then, it would be ostensibly possible to take a decision retracting the previous decision that approved entry to the Eurozone.&lt;ref name=mar/&gt;

Acknowledging that the method of any departure from the Eurozone remains "unknown," legal analysts have pointed out that any potential withdrawal "includes the spectre that euro obligations owed by residents of departing member states might be redenominated into [the] newly established national currencies."&lt;ref name=smith&gt;"[http://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/-/media/HS/L07121134579122224.pdf Eurozone crisis – the corporate perspective]", [[Herbert Smith LLP]] report, January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On the issue of leaving the Eurozone, the [[European Commission]] has stated that "[t]he irrevocability of membership in the euro area is an integral part of the Treaty framework and the Commission, as a guardian of the EU Treaties, intends to fully respect [that irrevocability]."&lt;ref name=rehn/&gt; It added that it "does not intend to propose [any] amendment" to the relevant Treaties, the current status being "the best way going forward to increase the resilience of euro area Member States to potential economic and financial crises.&lt;ref name=rehn&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2012-004398&amp;language=EN Text] of response by [[Olli Rehn]], [[European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro]], on behalf of the [[European Commission]], to question submitted by Claudio Morganti, [[Member of the European Parliament]], 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Central Bank]], responding to a question by a [[Member of the European Parliament]], has stated that an exit is not allowed under the Treaties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/20121107_morganti.en.pdf Text] of message by [[Mario Draghi]], [[European Central Bank|ECB]], to Claudio Morganti, [[Member of the European Parliament]], 6 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The economist, Professor [[Joseph Stiglitz]] of Colombia University remarked that  "the challenge, of course, will be to find a way to leave the eurozone that minimizes the economic and political costs. A massive debt restructuring, carefully done, with special attention to the consequences for domestic financial institutions, will be essential. Without such a restructuring, the burden of euro denominated debt would soar, offsetting possibly a large part of the potential gains." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.politico.eu/article/opinion-italy-germany-how-to-exit-the-eurozone-euro-reform/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic considerations==
At the [[American Economic Association]]'s annual meeting of 2015, [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley University]] economic historian [[Barry Eichengreen]] predicted that the withdrawal of a member state, such as Greece, from the Eurozone, would "set off [a] devastating turmoil in financial markets."&lt;ref name=squared&gt;"[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/greek-euro-exit-would-be-lehman-brothers-squared-economist-2015-01-03 Greek euro exit would be ‘Lehman Brothers squared’: economist]" by Greg Robb, ''[[Market Watch]]'', 5 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; At the same event, [[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor of Public Policy and professor of Economics [[Kenneth Rogoff]] characterised the overall common-currency project in Europe a "historic disaster",&lt;ref name=squared/&gt; while Harvard professor of Economics and [[National Bureau of Economic Research|NBER]] president emeritus [[Martin Feldstein]] opined that "there may be no way to end to [the] [[Euro crisis]]," and suggested that to avoid a break-up and "ensure the Euro's survival," the best way forward "would be for each individual Eurozone member-state to enact its own [[tax policies]] to spur [[demand]], including cutting the [[value-added tax]] for the next five years to increase [[consumer spending]]."&lt;ref name=squared/&gt;

Specifically for [[Greece]], a 2015 [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]] study&lt;ref name=pwc&gt;"[http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/economy/global-economy-watch/assets/pdfs/global-economy-watch-march-2015.pdf What would a Greek exit mean for the Eurozone?]", [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; expected the "new [[drachma]]" to [[Foreign exchange market#Determinants of exchange rates|depreciate]] "almost immediately" and inflation in the country to rise "sharply" to around 6% on average. The study predicted that "the [new currency's] depreciation would lead to a high inflationary environment with a medium-term inflation rate of around 4%, more than double the expected rate in the Eurozone."&lt;ref name=pwc/&gt; German [[ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] economist and president of the [[Ifo Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung|Ifo Institute for Economic Research]] [[Hans-Werner Sinn]], on the other hand, argued for the economic benefits for Greece if the country were to withdraw from the Eurozone.&lt;ref name=better&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/25/opinion/why-greece-should-leave-the-eurozone.html?_r=0 Why Greece Should Leave the Eurozone]" by [[Hans-Werner Sinn]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 24 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, German finance minister [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] reportedly&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-document-floats-5-year-greek-exit-from-eurozone-1436642043 German Document Floats Five-Year Greek Exit From Eurozone]" by Gabrielle Steinhauser, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]], 11 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;[https://www.rt.com/news/273247-greece-timeout-bailout-grexit/ 5-year "timeout" from the euro for Greece is “off the table” – Martin Schulz] (with copy of document claimed to contain text of time-out proposal) ''[[RT (TV network)|RT]]'', 13 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that Greece "temporarily" exits the Eurozone for 5 years and re-introduces a [[national currency]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.yahoo.com/news/germany-mulling-five-temporary-grexit-plan-european-source-171141074.html?ref=gs Germany mulling five-year temporary Grexit plan]", Yahoo News, 11 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=floats&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-greece-germany-paper-idUSL8N0ZR0S720150711 Germany floats Greek euro 'time-out' without more reforms]" by Tom Körkemeier and Andreas Rinke, ''[[Reuters]]'', 11 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= courage&gt;"[https://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2015/07/15/schaubles-timeout-plan-for-greece-was-courageous-says-slovak-minister/ Schäuble’s Timeout Plan for Greece Was ‘Courageous,’ Says Slovak Minister]" by Gabriele Steinhauser,''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 15 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The "informal" proposal contained a provision whereby Athens would transfer state assets worth €50&amp;nbsp;billion into a [[trust fund]] located in [[Luxembourg]] and controlled by the [[European Stability Mechanism]], in order for the assets to be sold off and the proceeds to pay off part of the Greek debt.&lt;ref name=saved/&gt; Analysts compared this "asset-stripping enterprise" to [[West Germany]]'s privatisation of [[East German]] state-property after the [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=saved/&gt;

The German finance minister, subsequently, stated that the German side "only called attention to the possibility that Athens itself can decide on taking a timeout," explaining that "[d]ebt relief is not possible within the currency union. European treaties do not allow it."&lt;ref name=dom&gt;"[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/interview-with-german-finance-minister-wolfgang-schaeuble-a-1044233.html Wolfgang Schäuble: 'There Is No German Dominance'] ", interview conducted by Klaus Brinkbäumer, Michael Sauga and Christian Reiermann, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 17 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Schäuble's informal proposal was reportedly withdrawn from the agenda by common agreement between the Greek government and the Eurozone leadership.&lt;ref name=saved&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/22/three-days-to-save-the-euro-greece Three days that saved the euro]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Finland]]'s parliament decided in late 2015 to debate within the next year whether to quit the Eurozone or not, in a move seen by analysts&lt;ref name=finn&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-finland-exit-idUSKCN0T518O20151116 Finnish parliament will debate next year leaving euro zone]", Reuters, 16 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as unlikely to end Finland's membership in the single-currency zone but would "highlight Finns' dissatisfaction with their country's economic performance."&lt;ref name=finn/&gt;

==Popular sentiment==
In the mid-2010s, polls conducted across Europe, showed that because of the general "disillusionment with the European Union,"&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/business/global/poll-shows-european-union-loses-favor-in-europe.html?_r=0 Grind of Euro Crisis Wears Down Support for Union, Poll Finds]" by James Kanter, ''The New York Times'', 13 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deva&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/05/10/devastating-mori-poll-shows-europes-peoples-share-british-rage-o/ Devastating MORI poll shows Europe's peoples share British rage over EU]" by [[Ambrose Evans-Pritchard]], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 10 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; which has "more noticeably affected Greece, [[Belgium]], the United Kingdom, the [[Netherlands]] and Italy," there is also a "significant erosion" in the support for a common currency.&lt;ref name=gal&gt;[http://www.gallup-international.bg/en/Publications/2015/255-International-Survey-on-EU-Prospects International Survey on EU Prospects], [[Gallup International Association|Gallup International]], 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In the majority of European countries surveyed in 2015 by [[Gallup International Association|Gallup International]] most respondents "oppose the Euro." In the two "key Eurozone members" Germany and France, as well as in Spain, majorities in favour of retaining the Euro as common currency are present.  Among Eurozone members the strongest anti-Euro sentiments were registered in Italy and Greece.&lt;ref name=gal/&gt;

In 2015, the Greek parliament approved the [[Syriza#January 2015 election|government]]'s proposal for a [[Greek bailout referendum, 2015|referendum]] that would ostensibly decide, through a decision between "Yes" or "No,"  the way forward in the ongoing negotiations of Greece with the [[European troika|creditors' institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33296839 Greece debt crisis: Tsipras announces bailout referendum]", BBC, 27 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the claims by analysts abroad and in Greece&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/27/greece-bailout-referendum-ramps-up-eurozone-crisis Tsipras’s shock call for vote on Greek bailout sets day of destiny for Europe]" by Ian Traynor, ''The Guardian'', 27 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; that the referendum might open the way for Greece's withdrawal from the Eurozone, and despite polls showing that Greek citizens would prefer keeping the common currency "at all costs,"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/06/16/poll-7-in-10-greeks-want-the-euro-at-any-cost/ Poll: 7 in 10 Greeks Want the Euro at Any Cost]" by Philip Chrysopoulos, ''[[Greek Reporter]]'', 16 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ekathimerini.com/198471/article/ekathimerini/news/greeks-want-to-stay-in-eurozone-two-polls-show Greeks want to stay in eurozone, two polls show]", ''[[Kathimerini]]'', 28 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; the referendum, conducted on 5 July 2015, returned a result of 61.3% for "No" and 38.7% for "Yes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ekloges.ypes.gr/current/e/public/index.html?lang=en July 2015 referendum results], Greek Ministry of the Interior website&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday, 13 July 2015, the government of Greece accepted the bailout package offered by the [[European troika|creditors' institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/12/thisisacoup_n_7781736.html German-Led Eurozone Launching Coup Against Greek Government]", ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 12 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3792">'''Yuri Nikolayevich Bogdanovich''' ({{lang-ru|'''Юрий Николаевич Богданович'''}}) (1849–1888) was a Russian revolutionary and [[Narodnik]]. His [[Pseudonym|cadre name]] was '''Kobozev''' ({{lang-ru|'''Кобозев'''}})

==Revolutionary beginnings==
Bogdanovich was born on April 1, 1849 in Nikolskoye, in [[Toropets]] [[ Uyezd]], [[Pskov Governorate]], into a noble family.

In 1869 Bogdanovich began work as county surveyor in the [[Velikiye Luki]] county of Pskov province. In 1871 he entered the [[St. Petersburg Medical-Surgical Academy]] but left in 1873 without being graduated, to concentrate on political activities. He began, with [[Vera Figner]], to agitate among the peasants in the [[Volsky district]] of [[Saratov Oblast|Saratov province]].

In 1876 Bogdanovich joined the new [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]] organization. On December 6, 1876, he participated in the "Kazan demonstration" in [[St. Petersburg]].

==Narodnik==
In 1879, Land and Liberty split into two factions. One faction (the "villagers") supported continued agitation and propaganda in the countryside, the other faction (the "politicals") supported adopting more direct methods: terrorism. Bogdanovich supported the latter position and when Land and Liberty broke in two, he joined the resulting splinter organization, the [[Narodnaya Volya|People's Will]] (Narodnaya Volya).

In 1880 Bogdanovich became a member of the executive committee of the People's Will and was an [[Pervomartovtsi|active participant]] in organizing the assassination of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]] on March 1, 1881.

Under his {{lang|fr|nom de révolution}} of Kobozeva, Bogdanovich had opened a cheese shop on [[Malaya Sadovaya Street]] in St. Petersburg, from which a tunnel was dug to the middle of the street for laying mines. On the day before the assassination (February 28) the shop was raided, but the tunnel was not discovered. The tunnel was not used in the March 1 assassination and Bogdanovich escaped the ensuing dragnet.

Bogdanovich worked to help recover the People's Will from its ideological and organizational crisis that followed the assassination. He was active in the [[Political Red Cross|Red Cross of the People's Will]], a prisoner relief organization, and helped organize escapes as well as legal appeals for the release of prisoners.

In 1881, Bogdanovich went to [[Siberia]] to prepare the [[Krasnoyarsk]] - [[Kazan]] section of the route for escaping prisoners and exiles. For a while he was hidden by [[Nadezhda Golovin]] while preparing the escape of [[Sophia Bardeen]].

==Arrest, trial, and death==
On May 15, 1882, Bogdanovich was arrested in [[Moscow]] and tried on charges of co-sponsoring the People's Will, conspiracy to commit terrorist acts, operating a bomb factory, and other charges. After a trial lasting from March 28 to April 3 he was sentenced to death.

On May 28 the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and Bogdanovich died in [[Shlisselburg#Fortress|Shlisselburg Fortress]] of tuberculosis on July 18, 1888.
