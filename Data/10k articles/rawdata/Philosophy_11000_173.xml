      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2990">"'''A Defence of Common Sense'''" is a 1925 [[essay]] by [[philosopher]] [[G. E. Moore]]. In it, he attempts to refute [[Epistemological_nihilism#Epistemology_and_skepticism|absolute skepticism (or nihilism)]] by arguing that at least some of our established beliefs - ''[[fact]]s'' - about the world are absolutely certain. Moore argues that these beliefs are [[common sense]].

==Summary==
In section one, he argues that he has certain knowledge of a number of [[truisms]], such as "My body has existed continuously on or near the earth, at various distances from or in contact with other existing things, including other living human beings", "I am a human being", and "My body existed yesterday".

In section two, he argues that there is a distinction between mental facts and physical facts. He says there is no good reason to hold, as many philosophers of his time did, that every physical fact is logically dependent on [[mental fact]]s, or that every physical fact is causally dependent on mental facts.  An example of a physical fact is "The mantelpiece is at present nearer to this body than that bookcase is." Mental facts include "I am conscious now" and "I am seeing something now."

In section three, he affirms that not only does he not think there are good reasons for believing that all material objects were created by [[God]], but neither does common sense give reasons to think that God exists at all or that there is an [[afterlife]].

The fourth section considers how common sense propositions like "[[Here is one hand|Here is my hand]]" are to be analysed. Moore considers three possibilities that occur to him for how what we know in these cases is related to what we know about our sense-data, i.e. what he sees when looking at his hand. Moore concludes that we are absolutely certain about the common sense belief, but that no analysis of the propositions has been offered that is even close to being certain.

The fifth section is an examination of [[the problem of other minds]]. Moore argues that "there are other 'selves'", but explains why this question has baffled philosophers. In other words, the sense data that he perceives through his senses are facts about the interaction of the external world and himself, but he (and other philosophers) do not know how to analyze these interactions.

== Life and work ==
Carter earned a [[Bachelor's degree|BA]] at the [[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]], a [[Master's degree|MA]] at the [[University of Sussex]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] at [[St Cross College, Oxford|St Cross College]] at the [[University of Oxford]].
Carter's first academic position was Lecturer in Political Theory at [[University College Dublin]]. He then became Head of the Philosophy Department at [[Heythrop College]], [[University of London]]. Subsequently, he was Professor of Philosophy and Environmental Studies at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].  He has been a Visiting Professor at the [[University of British Columbia]] and at the [[University of Bucharest]]. For a number of years Carter was joint editor of the ''[[Journal of Applied Philosophy]]''.

He works principally in [[political philosophy]], [[moral philosophy]], and [[environmental philosophy]]. Carter has published on a wide range of topics: within political philosophy he has written on political obligation, equality, and [[property right]]s; within environmental philosophy he has written on the moral status of both nonhuman animals and ecosystems; within [[applied ethics]] he has written on problems regarding future persons and world hunger; within [[political theory]] he has written on theories of the state and [[Third World]] underdevelopment; and within [[anarchism and Marxism]] Carter has written on their respective theories of history. He is currently developing an environmentalist moral theory that is, [[normative ethics|normatively]],  [[value pluralism|value pluralist]] and, [[metaethics|metaethically]], [[projectivism|projectivist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/philosophy/ourstaff/ |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016085729/http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/philosophy/ourstaff/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-10-16 |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;University of Glasgow :: Philosophy :: Our staff&lt;/nowiki&gt; |accessdate=2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; topics he has previously written about in moral theory.

Some of Carter's work in environmental philosophy is discussed critically by [[Robin Attfield]].&lt;ref name="Attfield"&gt;See for example Attfield, R., ''Environmental Ethics: An Overview for the Twenty-First Century''. Polity-Blackwell (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's state-primacy theory has been discussed by [[Robyn Eckersley]]&lt;ref name="Eckersley"&gt;Eckersley, R. ''The Green State: Rethinking Democracy and Sovereignty''. MIT Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and criticized by [[John Barry (politician)|John Barry]].&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, J. ''Rethinking Green Politics: Nature, Virtue and Progress''. Sage (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and, most fully, by Simon Hailwood.&lt;ref name="Hailwood"&gt;Hailwood, S. ''How to be a Green Liberal: Nature, Value and Liberal Philosophy''. Acumen (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Carter has responded by arguing that his critics fail to take sufficiently into account the problems the military causes in modern societies: "it is telling how little attention green liberal critics of the state-primacy theory have paid to the role of the military and to its highly distorting effects. Failing to examine in any detail military requirements within ostensibly 'liberal democracies', whether existing or imagined, is more like simply ignoring an argument rather than answering it."&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;Carter, A. "Beyond primacy: Marxism, anarchism and radical green political theory," ''Environmental Politics'' 19, 6 (2010): 951-972, here at 971n.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter was one of the founder members of the London-based Anarchist Research Group.&lt;ref name="Goodway"&gt;Goodway, D. (ed.), ''[[For Anarchism: History, Theory, and Practice]]''. Routledge (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin Ward]] has described Carter, with [[Murray Bookchin]], as one of the leading [[eco-anarchism|eco-anarchist]] thinkers.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, C. ''Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of academia, Carter is a former Chair of the [[World Development Movement|World Development Movement Scotland]] and a former Board Member of [[Friends of the Earth Scotland]]. He is also a former Board Member and a former Trustee of [[Friends of the Earth (EWNI)|Friends of the Earth]].

==Publications==
Carter's publications include over 50 articles in academic journals and he is the author of 3 books:
*{{cite book |title=A Radical Green Political Theory |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-20309-8 }} (1999)

'''Brian Klug''' is senior research fellow and tutor in philosophy at [[St. Benet's Hall, Oxford]] and a member of the philosophy faculty at [[Oxford University]]. He is also an honorary fellow of the Parkes Institute for the Study of Jewish/non-Jewish Relations, University of Southampton and fellow of the College, Saint Xavier University, Chicago.

He is associate editor of ''Patterns of Prejudice'', a peer-reviewed journal examining social exclusion and stigmatization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/0031322X.asp ''Patterns of Prejudice''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923094858/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/0031322X.asp |date=September 23, 2006 }}, Taylor and Francis Group, retrieved September 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and a founder member of the Jewish Forum for Justice and Human Rights, a UK-based group that addresses racism and [[anti-Semitism]], the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], immigration, and the treatment of [[asylum seeker]]s.

Klug was one of a number of academics who submitted evidence to the British [[All-Party Parliamentary Group against Antisemitism|All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism]], which published its report in September 2006.&lt;ref name=APP58&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf |title= "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism" |access-date= 2006-09-07 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070614033520/http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf# |archive-date= 2007-06-14 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(430&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, September 2006, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; He has criticized the concept of [[new antisemitism]] as being "confused" in his 2004 essay "The Myth of the New Anti-Semitism" published in ''[[The Nation]]'',&lt;ref name=brianklug&gt;Klug, Brian, [http://www.thenation.com/article/myth-new-anti-semitism The Myth of the New Anti-Semitism], ''The Nation'', February 2, 2004, accessed September 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and in several other writings.

In February 2007, he was a signatory to the declaration of [[Independent Jewish Voices]], a new Jewish group in the UK, which criticized the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] for its allegedly unconditional support of [[Israel]].

Although the [[Hebrew Bible]] is the result of a [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|developmental process]], canonical criticism focuses on the final form of the text.]]
'''Canonical criticism''', sometimes called '''canon criticism''' or the '''canonical approach''', is a way of [[Biblical hermeneutics|interpreting]] the [[Bible]] that focuses on the text of the [[biblical canon]] itself as a finished product. It has been made popular by [[Brevard Childs]], though he personally rejected the term.&lt;ref name=Introduction82&gt;Brevard S. Childs, ''Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture'' (SCM, 1979), 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas other types of [[biblical criticism]] focus on the origins, structure and history of the text, canonical criticism looks at the meaning the text in its final form has for the community which uses it. 

==Description==

Canonical criticism involves "paying attention to the present form of the text in determining its meaning for the believing community."&lt;ref&gt;John N. Oswalt, "Canonical Criticism: A Review From A Conservative Viewpoint," ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' 30.3 [1987] 318.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]], it involves concentrating authority "in the canonical text, and not in the people or events out of which that text came."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]], "Childs' Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture," ''[[JSOT]]'' 16 [1980] 16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brevard Childs]] says that the [[Biblical canon|canon]] "not only serves to establish the outer boundaries of authoritative Scripture," but "forms a prism through which light from the different aspects of the Christian life is refracted."&lt;ref&gt;Brevard S. Childs, ''Biblical Theology of the Old and New Testaments'' (Augsburg Fortress, 1993), p. 672.&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that "the tradents of the tradition have sought to hide their own footprints in order to focus attention on the canonical text itself and not on the process."&lt;ref&gt;Brevard S. Childs, "The Canonical Shape of the Prophetic Literature," ''Interpretation'' 32 [1978] p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Childs refuses to speak of canonical ''criticism'' as if it were on a level with [[form criticism]] or [[redaction criticism]]. According to Childs, it represents an entirely new departure, ''replacing'' the entire [[Higher criticism|historical-critical method]].&lt;ref name=Introduction82/&gt;

[[John H. Sailhamer]] views the "canonical approach" as including the "canon criticism" of Childs, as well as composition criticism, [[redaction criticism]], and [[text linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John H. Sailhamer]], ''Introduction to Old Testament Theology: A Canonical Approach'' ([[Zondervan]], 1995), 97-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
{{Bible-related |studies}}

Canonical criticism is a relatively new approach to biblical studies. As recently as 1983, [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]] could state that canon had no hermeneutical significance for biblical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]], ''Holy Scripture: Canon, Authority, Criticism'' (Westminster John Knox, 1983), 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Childs set out his canonical approach in his ''Biblical Theology in Crisis'' (1970) and applied it in ''Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture'' (1979).

The phrase "canonical criticism" was first used by [[James A. Sanders]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[[James A. Sanders]], ''Torah and Canon'' (Fortress Press, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Childs repudiates the term because
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It implies that the concern with canon is viewed as another historical-critical technique which can take its place alongside of source criticism, form criticism, rhetorical criticism, and the like. I do not envision the approach to canon in this light. Rather, the issue at stake in canon turns on establishing a stance from which the Bible is to be read as Sacred Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Childs, "Canonical Shape," p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Canonical criticism arose as a reaction to other forms of [[biblical criticism]]. [[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]] argues that Child's primary thesis is that [[Higher criticism|historical-critical]] methods are "unsatisfactory theologically."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]], ''Reading the Old Testament: Method in Biblical Study'' (London: Darton, Longman and Todd, 1984), 79.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Barton, Childs' approach is "genuinely new," in that it is an "attempt to heal the breach between biblical criticism and theology," and in that it belongs more to the realm of [[literary criticism]] than that of 'historical' study of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, ''Reading the Old Testament'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanders argues that canonical criticism is biblical criticism's "self-critical stance":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is not only a logical evolution of earlier stages in the growth of criticism but it also reflects back on all the disciplines of biblical criticism and informs them all to some extent."&lt;ref&gt;James A. Sanders, ''Canon and Community: A Guide to Canonical Criticism'' (Fortress, 1984), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He also suggests that it places the Bible "back where it belongs, in the believing communities of today":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Canonical criticism might be seen in metaphor as the [[beadle]] (''bedelos'') who now carries the critically studied Bible in procession back to the church lectern from the scholar's study.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, ''Canon and Community,'' p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Barton has noted parallels between canonical criticism and the [[New Criticism]] of [[T. S. Eliot]] and others. Both schools of thought affirm that "a literary text is an artefact," that "[[Intentional fallacy|intentionalism]] is a fallacy," and that "the meaning of a text is a function of its place in the literary canon."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, ''Reading the Old Testament'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The canonical approach has been criticised by scholars from both liberal and evangelical perspectives. On the one hand, according to Dale Brueggemann, [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]] accuses Childs of "aiding and abetting" [[fundamentalists]].&lt;ref&gt;Dale A. Brueggemann, "[http://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/32/32-3/32-3-pp311-326_JETS.pdf Brevard Childs' Canon Criticism: An Example of Post-critical Naiveté]," ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society|JETS]]'' 32 [1989] 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Childs' approach is "post-critical" rather than pre-critical,&lt;ref&gt;Barton, ''Reading the Old Testament'', 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Barr argues that the vision of a post-critical era "is the conservative dream."&lt;ref&gt;Barr, "Childs' Introduction," 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Barton, however, notes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whatever else Childs is doing, he is not taking us 'back to the canon', for no one has ever been aware of the canon in this way before. It is only after we have seen how varied and inconsistent the Old Testament really is that we can begin to ask whether it can ''nonetheless'' be read as forming a unity.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, ''Reading the Old Testament'', 99.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Conservative scholars, on the other hand, object to the way canonical criticism bypasses "vexed questions relating to the historical validation of revelation."&lt;ref&gt;Oswalt, "Canonical Criticism," 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Oswalt suggests that canonical critics blithely "separate fact and meaning" when they suggest that we are called to submit to the inspired truth of the text, despite the community's inability to admit where they really got it.&lt;ref&gt;Oswalt, "Canonical Criticism," 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barton also suggests that there is tension between "the text itself" and "the text as part of the canon".&lt;ref name=Barton171&gt;Barton, ''Reading the Old Testament'', 171.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the canonical approach stresses both the text in its final form as we have it, as well as the idea that "the words which compose the text draw their meaning from the context and setting in which they are meant to be read."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, ''Reading the Old Testament'', 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Barton argues that "the canonical approach actually undermines the concern for the finished text as an end in itself, and brings us, once again, nearer to traditional historical criticism."&lt;ref name=Barton171 /&gt;

==Applications==
Childs applies his canonical approach to [[Nevi'im|prophetic literature]], and argues that in [[Book of Amos|Amos]], "an original prophetic message was expanded by being placed in a larger theological context,"&lt;ref&gt;Childs, "Canonical Shape," p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Book of Nahum|Nahum]] and [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]], the oracles are assigned a new role through the introduction of hymnic material, and they "now function as a dramatic illustration of the eschatological triumph of God."&lt;ref&gt;Childs, "Canonical Shape," p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jon Isaak applies the canonical approach to [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians 14]] and the issue of [[Paul of Tarsus and women|women being silent in the church]]. Isaak argues that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the canonical approach, theological concerns take precedent over historical interests. No attempt is made to reconstruct a historical portrait of Paul in order to prove some point or to disprove another. There is no psychologizing based on what Paul could or could not have said.&lt;ref&gt;Jon M. Isaak, "[http://www.directionjournal.org/24/2/hearing-gods-word-in-silence-canonical.html Hearing God's Word in the Silence : A Canonical Approach to 1 Corinthians 14.34–35]," ''Direction'' 24.2 [1995], pp. 55-64.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Gerald H. Wilson]] adopted a canonical approach in his studies of [[Book of Psalms|Psalter]], and concluded that the book had a purposeful unity and "had been [[Redaction|redacted]] to represent a developing sequence of ideals."&lt;ref name=Koh&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koh|first1=Yee Von|chapter=G. H. Wilson's theories on the organization of the Masoretic Psalter|title=Genesis, Isaiah, and Psalms: A Festschrift to Honour Professor John Emerton for His Eightieth Birthday|date=2010|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]|page=177|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=1DXDt2-eJsYC&amp;pg=PA177|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yee Von Koh suggests that Wilson was "the first to apply canonical criticism to the study of the Psalter in the clearest and most comprehensive way."&lt;ref name=Koh /&gt;

The canonical approach has also been applied to passages such as [[Psalm 137]]&lt;ref&gt;William John Lyons, "A man of honour, a man of strength, a man of will?: a canonical approach to Psalm 137" ''[[Didaskalia (journal)|Didaskalia]]'' 16.2 [2005], p 41-68.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 20.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Hahn ]] and John S. Bergsma, "What laws were 'not good'? a canonical approach to the theological problem of Ezekiel 20:25–26." ''[[Journal of Biblical Literature|JBL]]'' 123.2 [2004], p 201-218.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catholic moral theology''' is a major category of [[doctrine]] in the [[Catholic Church]], equivalent to a [[religious ethics]]. Moral theology encompasses Roman [[Catholic social teaching]], Catholic [[medical ethics]], [[sexual ethics]], and various doctrines on individual moral [[virtue]] and moral theory. It can be distinguished as dealing with "how one is to act", in contrast to dogmatic theology which proposes "what one is to believe".

==Description==

Sources of Catholic moral theology include both the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]], and philosophical ethics such as [[natural law]] that are seen as compatible with Catholic doctrine.  Moral theology was mostly undifferentiated from theology in general during the patristic era, and is found in the homilies, letters and commentaries on Scripture of the early Church fathers.  During the Middle Ages, moral theology developed in precision and scope through [[ethics in religion|scholasticism]].

Contemporary Catholic moral theology is developed by acts of the [[Magisterium]], by the [[Pope]], other [[bishops]], and by the works of lay Catholic moral theologians, which include magisterial teachings, as well as (in some matters) theological opinions. Examples of Catholic moral theologians include [[Alphonsus_Liguori|St. Alphonsus Liguori]], [[Germain Grisez]] (author of ''The Way of the Lord Jesus'') and [[John Finnis]] (author of ''Natural Law and Natural Rights''). Moral theology tends to be advanced most authoritatively through official statements of doctrine, such as papal [[encyclicals]], which are based on the dogmatic pronouncements of [[Ecumenical Councils]] (e.g., [[Vatican II]]), [[Sacred Scriptures]], and [[Sacred Tradition]]. In addition, moral theologians publish their own works and write in a variety of [[academic journal|journals]] devoted in whole, or in part to moral theology. These scholarly journals are helpful in making the theology of the Church more clear and accessible to others, and serve as a forum in which scholarly discussion of understanding and application of issues occurs. However, these journals ''per se'' do not add or remove anything from Catholic teaching.

The [[curriculum]] for [[Formation_in_the_Catholic_Church|formation]] of [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priests]] commonly includes required and elective courses in Catholic moral theology.

==Approaches to Catholic moral theology==
*In a [[deontological]] approach, morality takes the form of a studying of "how one is to act" in relation to the laws established by the faith. 
*In a [[teleological]] approach, "how one is to act" is related to the ultimate end which is again established by the faith. 
*In a [[Bernhard Häring#dialogic approach to Catholic moral theology|dialogic approach]], morality follows the pattern of faith directly, the "how one is to act" is related to an encounter with God through faith.&lt;ref&gt;BERNHARD HÄRING , ''Free and faithful in Christ''. Moral Theology for priests and laity, I/General Moral Theology. For freedom Christ has set us free (Gal 5,1), Slough 1978, ''focus on chapter 3'' &lt;/ref&gt; Moral living is response to the Logos or Word of God. "Faith in the [[Logos]]...understands moral values as responsibility, as a response to the Word, and thus gives them their intelligibility as well as their essential orientation." &lt;ref&gt; Ratzinger, Joseph Cardinal ([[Pope_Benedict_XVI]]). Introduction To Christianity, 2nd Edition (Communio Books) (Kindle Locations 304-306). Ignatius Press. &lt;/ref&gt;

A '''counterintuitive''' proposition is one that does not seem likely to be [[truth|true]] when assessed using [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[common sense]], or [[gut feelings]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/counter+intuitive "'''Counterintuitive''': ''–adjective''. Counter to what intuition would lead one to expect: The direction we had to follow was counterintuitive—we had to go north first before we went south." Retrieved: 09 NOV 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientifically discovered or mathematically proven [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] truths are often called counterintuitive when intuition, [[emotions]], and other [[cognitive process]]es outside of deductive [[rationality]] interpret them to be wrong. However, the subjective nature of intuition limits the objectivity of what to call counterintuitive because what is counterintuitive for one may be intuitive for another. This might occur in instances where intuition changes with knowledge. For instance, many aspects of [[quantum mechanics]] or [[general relativity]] may sound counterintuitive to a [[layman]], while they may be intuitive to a particle physicist. 

Flawed intuitive understanding of a problem may lead to counterproductive behavior with [[Unintended consequences|undesirable outcomes]]. In some such cases, counterintuitive policies may then produce a more desirable outcome.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist, July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead to conflicts between those who hold [[deontological]] and [[consequentialist]] ethical perspectives on those issues.

==Counterintuition in science==
Many scientific ideas that are generally accepted by people today were formerly considered to be contrary to intuition and common sense.

For example, most everyday experience suggests that the [[flat-Earth theory|Earth is flat]]{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}; actually, this view turns out to be a remarkably good approximation to the true state of affairs, which is that the Earth is a ''very big'' (relative to the day-to-day scale familiar to humans) [[oblate spheroid]].
Furthermore, prior to the [[Copernican revolution]], [[heliocentrism]], the belief that the Earth goes around the Sun, rather than ''vice versa'', was considered to be contrary to common sense.

Another counterintuitive scientific idea concerns [[spaceflight|space travel]]: it was initially believed that highly streamlined shapes would be best for re-entering the earth's atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} In fact, experiments proved that [[Atmospheric reentry#Blunt body entry vehicles|blunt-shaped re-entry bodies]] make the most efficient heat shields when returning to earth from space. Blunt-shaped re-entry vehicles have been used for all manned spaceflights, including the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Space Shuttle]] missions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freshbrainz.com/2009/12/counterintuitive-science-fast-speed-fat.html '''Fresh Brainz'''. ''Counterintuitive Science: Fast Speed, Fat Shape''. "It turns out that pointy-nosed spaceships perform well on their way out of the atmosphere, but not when they have to come BACK." Retrieved 09 NOV 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] sought to measure the velocity of the Earth through the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] as it revolved around the Sun. The result was that it has no aether velocity at all. [[Relativity theory]] later explained the results, replacing the conventional notions of aether and separate space, time, mass, and energy with a counterintuitive four-dimensional [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] universe.&lt;ref&gt;http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/lectures/michelson.html ''The Michelson-Morley Experiment''. "As a result of Michelson’s efforts in 1879, the speed of light was known to be 186,350 miles per second with a likely error of around 30 miles per second.  This measurement, made by timing a flash of light travelling between mirrors in Annapolis, agreed well with less direct measurements based on astronomical observations.  Still, this did not really clarify the nature of light.  Two hundred years earlier, Newton had suggested that light consists of tiny particles generated in a hot object, which spray out at very high speed, bounce off other objects, and are detected by our eyes.  Newton’s arch-enemy Robert Hooke, on the other hand, thought that light must be a kind of wave motion, like sound.  To appreciate his point of view, let us briefly review the nature of sound." Retrieved: 09 NOV 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Some further counterintuitive examples are:

In science:
* [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] - for thousands of years, it was confidently assumed that [[arithmetic]], and therefore similar [[formal system|systems of logic]], were completely solid in terms of being reliable for deductions. Gödel proved that such systems could not be both [[completeness (logic)|complete]] and [[consistency|consistent]].
* [[Wave–particle duality]] / [[photoelectric effect]] - As demonstrated by the [[Double-slit experiment|double slit experiment]] light and quantum particles behave as both waves and particles.
* A significant number of people find it difficult to accept the mathematical fact that [[0.999...#Proofs|0.999... equals 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tall |first1=D.

* The [[Monty Hall problem]] poses a simple yes-or-no question from probability that even professionals can find difficult to reconcile with their intuition.
* [[Horseshoe orbit]]s in orbital mechanics
* That light may pass through two perpendicularly oriented [[polarizing filter]]s if a third filter, not oriented perpendicular to either of the other two, is placed between them.&lt;ref&gt;http://alienryderflex.com/polarizer/&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Mpemba effect]], in which, under certain circumstances, a warmer body of water will freeze faster than a cooler body in the same environment.
* That [[water vapor]] is lighter than [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] and is the reason [[cloud]]s float and [[barometer]]s work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~stevenb/vapor/&lt;/ref&gt;

In politics and economics:
* The violation of the [[monotonicity criterion]] in voting systems
* David Ricardo's theory of [[comparative advantage]] that suggests that comparative advantage is in general more important than absolute advantage

Many examples of [[cognitive bias]], such as:
* The [[clustering illusion]] that suggests that significant patterns exist in a set of random points when no other cause than chance is present
* That [[alignments of random points on a plane]] are vastly easier to find than intuition would suggest

'''Diaspora''' is a free [[personal web server]]&lt;ref name="kickstarter-pitch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/196017994/diaspora-the-personally-controlled-do-it-all-distr|title=Decentralize the web with Diaspora&amp;nbsp;– Kickstarter|last=Salzberg|first=Maxwell|author2=Daniel Grippi |author3=Raphael Sofaer |author4=Ilya Zhitomirskiy |work=Kickstarter|accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that implements a [[distributed social network]]ing service. Installations of the software form nodes (termed "pods") which make up the distributed [[Diaspora (social network)|Diaspora social network]].

The project was founded by Dan Grippi, Maxwell Salzberg, Raphael Sofaer and [[Ilya Zhitomirskiy]], students at [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]]. The group received [[crowdfunding]] in excess of $200,000 via [[Kickstarter]]. A consumer alpha version was released on 23 November 2010.

Konrad Lawson, blogging for the [[Chronicle of Higher Education]], suggested Diaspora in July 2011 as an alternative to corporately produced software.&lt;ref name=CHE&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawson|first=Konrad|title=Remembering Diaspora: The Open Source Social Network|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/remembering-diaspora-the-open-source-social-network/34627?sid=wc|work=Chronicle of Higher Education|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2011| quote=Even if they never dominate the field, their decentralized approach and rallying cry to “take back your network” may help maintain a sustained pressure on the Googles and Facebooks of the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Diaspora is intended to address [[Privacy concerns with social networking services|privacy concerns related to centralized social networks]] by allowing users set up their own server (or "pod") to host content; pods can then interact to share status updates, photographs, and other social data.&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diaspora: A first peek at Facebook's challenger|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9186498/Diaspora_A_first_peek_at_Facebook_s_challenger|publisher=Computerworld|accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows its users to host their data with a traditional web host, a cloud-based host, an [[ISP]], or a friend. The [[software framework|framework]], which is built on [[Ruby on Rails]], is [[free software]] and can be modified and extended by external developers.

A key part of the original Diaspora software design concept was that it should act as a "social aggregator", allowing posts to be easily imported from [[Facebook]], [[Tumblr]] and [[Twitter]]. As ''[[Village Voice]]'' writer Nick Pinto explained, "the idea is that this lowers the barriers to joining the network, and as more of your friends join, you no longer need to bounce communications through Facebook. Instead, you can communicate directly, securely, and without running exchanges past the prying eyes of Zuckerberg and his business associates."&lt;ref name="Pinto15Feb12"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-02-15/news/the-facebook-killers/3/|title = Rise of the Facebook-Killers page 3|accessdate = 20 February 2012|last = Pinto|first = Nick|date = 15 February 2012|work = [[The Village Voice]]|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120219221613/http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-02-15/news/the-facebook-killers/3/|archivedate = 19 February 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, the API for this feature was still under discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Current_and_future_development#Create_an_API|title=Current and future development - diaspora* project wiki|work=diasporafoundation.org|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

After the project raised over $200,000 in crowdfunding via the [[Kickstarter]] website by 1 June 2010, the group began working on the software.&lt;ref name="kickstarter-pitch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes-article"/&gt; A developer preview with a number of security holes was released on 15 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodin|first=Dan|title=Code for open-source Facebook littered with landmines|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/16/diaspora_pre_alpha_landmines/|publisher=The Register|accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 November, a redesigned website was published in preparation for the alpha release, with the old site still available as a blog section. The early security holes were fixed with the alpha release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.joindiaspora.com/2010/11/23/private-alpha-released.html|title=Private Alpha Invites Going Out Today|work=joindiaspora|accessdate=17 December 2010|date=10 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222020913/http://blog.joindiaspora.com/2010/11/23/private-alpha-released.html|archivedate=22 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early alpha version contained many bugs and security flaws, but feedback on the free software led to quick improvements.&lt;ref name="Weise10May12"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-10/on-diasporas-social-network-you-own-your-data|title = On Diaspora's Social Network, You Own Your Data|accessdate = 14 May 2012|last = Weise|first = Karen|date = 15 May 2012| work = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its foundation was completed, Diaspora's developers intended to concentrate on creating a "battery of add-on modules" in order to "facilitate any type of communication," and planned to offer a paid hosting service for Diaspora seeds.&lt;ref name="kickstarter-pitch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="diaspora-project-outline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.joindiaspora.com/project.html|accessdate=12 May 2010|title=join diaspora&amp;nbsp;– the project|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126232042/http://blog.joindiaspora.com/project.html|archivedate=26 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software's beta release was originally scheduled for November 2011, but was postponed due to the need to add new design features and also Zhitomirskiy’s death.&lt;ref name="Weise10May12" /&gt; In February 2012, the developers indicated that they had completed work on the software back-end to improve both pod up-time and website response time. The next phase of work involved changes to the user interface and its associated terminology to reflect the way users are actually interacting, as the software moves towards [[Betaware|beta status]], anticipated for later on in 2012.&lt;ref name="DiasporaBlog03Feb12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.diasporafoundation.org/2012/02/03/diaspora-grows-up.html |title=DIASPORA* grows up |accessdate=4 February 2012 |last=Grippi |first=Dan |date=3 February 2012 |work=Diaspora Foundation Blog |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206042623/http://blog.diasporafoundation.org/2012/02/03/diaspora-grows-up.html |archivedate=6 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2012, development was underway to allow a high degree of customization of user posts, permitting users to post different media, such as text, photos and video with a high degree of personalization and individual expression. The developers felt that allowing individual creativity in posts would differentiate the Diaspora platform from competitors.&lt;ref name="Weise10May12" /&gt;

In June 2012, the development team was scheduled to move to [[Mountain View, California]] as part of work with startup accelerator [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]].&lt;ref name="Weise10May12" /&gt; In August 2012 the developers focus changed to working on creating makr.io, as part of their yCombinator class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20120816/diasporas-next-act-social-remixing-site-makr-io/ |title=Diaspora's Next Act: Social Remixing Site Makr.io – Liz Gannes – Social |publisher=AllThingsD |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the founders of Diaspora announced that they would let the community take over governance of the project, while they would stay involved, but take a lesser role. The project was adopted by, and became part of, the Free Software Support Network (FSSN), which is in turn run by [[Eben Moglen]] and the [[Software Freedom Law Center]]. The FSSN acts as an umbrella organization to Diaspora development and manages Diaspora's branding, finances and legal assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.numerama.com/magazine/23532-les-createurs-de-diaspora-confient-les-renes-a-la-communaute.html|accessdate=1 September 2012|newspaper=Numerama|title=Les créateurs de Diaspora confient les rênes à la communauté}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaspora27Aug12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.diasporafoundation.org/2012/08/27/announcement-diaspora-will-now-be-a-community-project.html |title=Announcement: Diaspora* Will Now Be A Community Project |accessdate=1 September 2012 |last=Grippi |first=Daniel and Maxwell Salzberg |date=27 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830214049/http://blog.diasporafoundation.org/2012/08/27/announcement-diaspora-will-now-be-a-community-project.html |archivedate=30 August 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.joindiaspora.com/ |title=Diaspora* |publisher=Joindiaspora.com |date=27 August 2012 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the project made its first community release at 0.0.1.0, dropping all references to the Alpha/Beta branding it had previously used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://diaspora-project.org/news/sun-10072012-0858/diaspora-0010-released|title=Diaspora 0.0.1.0 Released!|accessdate= 17 May 2013|work= The Diaspora Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time development was moved to a development branch, leaving the master branch for stable releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loomio.org/discussions/628?proposal=474|title=Define a clear git branching model|work=Loomio|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, efforts were underway to package Diaspora for [[Linux]] distributions and other systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://devblog.joindiaspora.com/2012/10/18/open-call-for-packagers/|accessdate=18 October 2012|work=Diaspora Developer Blog|title=Open Call for Packagers|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021212024/http://devblog.joindiaspora.com/2012/10/18/open-call-for-packagers/|archivedate=21 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release history==
Diaspora uses a [[semantic versioning]] scheme that is prefixed with another number which will be increased when necessary to indicate a major milestone for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loomio.org/discussions/613?proposal=541|title=Adopt a versioning scheme and release cycle.|work=Loomio|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emptiness''' as a [[human condition]] is a sense of generalized [[boredom]], [[social alienation]] and [[apathy]]. Feelings of emptiness often accompany [[dysthymia]],&lt;ref&gt;Downs, A. The Half-Empty Heart: A supportive guide to breaking free from chronic discontent. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[loneliness]], [[anhedonia]],
[[wiktionary:despair|despair]], or other mental/emotional disorders, including [[schizoid personality disorder]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post trauma]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[schizotypal personality disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder]].  A sense of emptiness is also part of a natural process of [[grief]], as resulting of [[wikt:separation|separation]], [[death]] of a loved one, or other significant changes. However, the particular meanings of “emptiness” vary with the particular context and the religious or cultural tradition in which it is used.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/186253/emptiness#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=emptiness%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=emptiness (mysticism) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Christianity and Western sociologists and psychologists view a state of emptiness as a negative, unwanted condition, in some Eastern philosophies such as [[Buddhist philosophy]] and [[Taoism]], emptiness ([[Śūnyatā]]) represents seeing through the illusion of independent self-nature.

==In Western culture==

===Sociology, philosophy, and psychology===
In the West, feeling "empty" is often viewed as a negative condition. Psychologist Clive Hazell, for example, attributes feelings of emptiness to problematic family backgrounds with abusive relationships and mistreatment.&lt;ref&gt;Paul L. Adams, Ivan Fras, "Beginning Child Psychiatry", page 208. Brunner Routledge (UK), 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that some people who are facing a sense of emptiness try to resolve their painful feelings by becoming addicted to a drug or obsessive activity (be it compulsive sex, gambling or work) or engaging in "frenzied action" or violence. In sociology, a sense of emptiness is associated with [[social alienation]] of the individual. This sense of alienation may be suppressed while working, due to the routine nature of work tasks, but during leisure hours or during the weekend, people may feel a sense of "existential vacuum" and emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindnc.com/psyall/Existentialism_A_Brief_Overview.pdf |website=Mind NC |date=2012-02-16 |title=Existentialism A Brief Overview |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005043502/http://www.mindnc.com/psyall/Existentialism_A_Brief_Overview.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In political philosophy, emptiness is associated with [[nihilism]]. Literary critic [[Georg Lukács]] (born in 1885) argued against the "spiritual emptiness and moral inadequacy of capitalism", and argued in favour of communism as an "entirely new type of civilization, one that promised a fresh start and an opportunity to lead a meaningful and purposeful life."&lt;ref&gt;We Didn't Start the Fire: Capitalism and Its Critics, Then and Now. By Sheri Berman, in Foreign Affairs. http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20030701fareviewessay15413/sheri-berman/we-didn-t-start-the-fire-capitalism-and-its-critics-then-and-now.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "emptiness" was important to a "certain type of [[existentialist]] philosophy and some forms of the [[Death of God]] movement".&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Existentialism, the "philosophic movement that gives voice to the sense of alienation and despair", comes from "man’s recognition of his fundamental aloneness in an indifferent universe". People whose response to the sense of emptiness and aloneness is to give excuses live in bad faith; "people who face the emptiness and accept responsibility aim to live 'authentic' lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.georgiasouthern.edu/~dougt/exist.htm |title=Existentialism |publisher=Personal.georgiasouthern.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216210805/http://personal.georgiasouthern.edu/~dougt/exist.htm |archivedate=2012-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialists argue that "man lives in alienation from God, from nature, from other men, from his own true self." Crowded into cities, working in mindless jobs, and entertained by light mass media, we "live on the surface of life", so that even "people who seemingly have 'everything' feel empty, uneasy, discontented."&lt;ref name=mrjeffrey&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrjeffrey.com/English%20IV/Existentialism/A_Primer_of_Existentialism.doc |website=iClass Zone |title=A Primer of Existentialism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultures where a sense of emptiness is seen as a negative psychological condition, it is often associated with depression. As such, many of the same treatments are proposed: [[psychotherapy]], group therapy, or other types of counselling. As well, people who feel empty may be advised to keep busy and maintain a regular schedule of work and social activities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Other solutions which have been proposed to reduce a sense of emptiness are getting a [[pet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petnet.com.au/releases/17121999.html Petnet - Responsible Ownership in Australia - And then there were two!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalo.edu/reporter/vol28/vol28n25/f1.html Mar. 27, 1997-Vol28n25: Research provides further evidence that pets, music effective at reducing stress&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or trying [[Animal-Assisted Therapy]]; getting involved in [[spirituality]] such as [[meditation]] or [[religion|religious]] rituals and service; [[Volunteering|volunteer]]ing to fill time and bring social contact; doing [[social interaction]]s, such as community activities, clubs, or outings; or finding a hobby or recreational activity to regain their interest in life.

===Christianity===
In Austrian philosopher/educator [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s (1861–1925) thinking, spiritual emptiness was a major problem in the educated European middle class. In his 1919 lectures he argued that European culture became "empty of spirit" and "ignorant of the needs, the conditions, that are essential for the life of the spirit". People experienced a "spiritual emptiness"  and their thinking became marked by a "lazy passivity" due to the "absence of will from the life of thought". In modern Europe, Steiner claimed that people would "allow their thoughts to take possession of them", and these thoughts were increasingly filled with abstraction and "pure, natural scientific thinking". The educated middle classes began to think in a way that was "devoid of spirit", with their minds becoming "dimmer and darker", and increasing empty of spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/SpiEmp_index.html |title=Lecture: Spiritual Emptiness and Social Life |location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Wn.rsarchive.org |date=1919-04-13 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Dupré, a Professor of Philosophy at Yale University, argues that the "spiritual emptiness of our time is a symptom of its religious poverty". He claims that "many people never experience any emptiness: they are too busy to feel much absence of any kind"; they only realize their spiritual emptiness if "painful personal experiences -- the death of a loved one, the collapse of a marriage, the alienation of a child, the failure of a business" shock them into reassessing their sense of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;SPIRITUAL LIFE AND THE SURVIVAL OF CHRISTIANITY:

Spiritual emptiness has been associated with juvenile violence. In John C. Thomas' 1999 book ''How Juvenile Violence Begins: Spiritual Emptiness'', he argues that youth in impoverished indigenous communities who feel empty may turn to fighting and aggressive crime to fill their sense of meaninglessness. In Cornell University professor [[James Garbarino]]'s 1999 book ''Lost Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them'', he argues that "neglect, shame, spiritual emptiness, alienation, anger and access to guns are a few of the elements common to violent boys". A professor of human development, Garbarino claims that violent boys have an "alienation from positive role models" and "a spiritual emptiness that spawns despair". These youth are seduced by the violent fantasy of the US gun culture, which provides negative role models of tough, aggressive men who use power to get what they want. He claims that boys can be helped by giving them "a sense of purpose" and "spiritual anchors" that can "anchor boys in empathy and socially engaged moral thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/April99/lost.boys.ssl.html |title=Cornell News: "Lost Boys" about teen violence |publisher=News.cornell.edu |date=1999-04-23 |accessdate=2012-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617200955/http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/April99/lost.boys.ssl.html |archivedate=2012-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiritual emptiness is often connected with addiction, especially by Christian-influenced addiction organizations and counsellors. Bill Wilson, the founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], argued that one of the impacts of alcoholism was causing a spiritual emptiness in heavy drinkers. In Abraham J. Twerski's 1997 book ''Addictive Thinking: Understanding Self-Deception'', he argues that when people feel spiritually empty, they often turn to addictive behaviors to fill the inner void. In contrast to having an empty stomach, which is a clear feeling, having spiritual emptiness is hard to identify, so it fills humans with a "vague unrest".  While people may try to resolve this emptiness by obsessively having sex, overeating, or taking drugs or alcohol, these addictions only give temporary satisfaction. When a person facing a crisis due to feeling spiritually empty is able to stop one addiction, such as compulsive sex, they often just trade it in for another addictive behaviour, such as gambling or overeating.&lt;ref&gt;Addictive Thinking: Understanding Self-Deception By Abraham J.

===Fiction, film, design and visual arts===
A number of novelists and filmmakers have depicted emptiness. The concept of "emptiness" was important to a "good deal of 19th–20th century Western imaginative literature".&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Novelist [[Franz Kafka]] depicted a meaningless bizarre world in ''[[The Trial]]'' and the [[existentialism|existentialist]] French authors sketched a world cut off from purpose or reason in [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[La Nausée]]'' and [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|L'étranger]]''. Existentialism influenced 20th century poet [[T.S. Eliot]], whose poem “[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]”  describes an "anti-hero or alienated soul, running away from or confronting the emptiness of his or her existence". Professor Gordon Bigelow argues that the existentialist theme of "spiritual barrenness is commonplace in literature of the 20th century", which in addition to Eliot includes [[Ernest Hemingway]], Faulkner, Steinbeck and Anderson.&lt;ref name=mrjeffrey/&gt;

Film adaptations of a number of existentialist novels capture the bleak sense of emptiness espoused by Sartre and Camus. This theme of emptiness has also been used in modern screenplays. [[Mark Romanek]]'s 1985 film ''[[Static (1986 film)|Static]]'' tells the surreal story of a struggling inventor and crucifix factory worker named Ernie who feels spiritually empty because he is saddened by his parents' death in an accident. Screenwriter Michael Tolkin's 1994 film ''[[The New Age (film)|The New Age]]'' examines "cultural hipness and spiritual emptiness", creating a "dark, ambitious, unsettling" film that depicts a fashionable LA couple who "are miserable in the midst of their sterile plenty", and whose souls are stunted by their lives of empty sex, consumption, and distractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Lisa Schwarzbaum|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303914,00.html |title=The New Age Review  |publisher=EW.com |date=1994-09-30 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' examines the spiritual emptiness of life in the US suburbs. In [[Wes Anderson]]'s 2007 film ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]'', three brothers who "... suffer from spiritual emptiness" and then "self-medicate themselves through sex, social withdrawal, and drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dibben |first=Chance |url=http://www.kansan.com/stories/2007/nov/01/movie_review/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070422033055/http://www.kansan.com/stories/2007/nov/01/movie_review/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-04-22 |title=Movie review |publisher=Kansan.com |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2012-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The 2008 film ''[[The Informers (2008 film)|The Informers]]'' is a [[Hollywood]] [[drama]] film written by [[Bret Easton Ellis]] and [[Nicholas Jarecki]] and directed by [[Gregor Jordan]]. The film is based on Ellis' 1994 collection of short stories of the [[The Informers|same name]]. The film, which is set amidst the decadence of the early 1980s, depicts an assortment of socially alienated, mainly well-off characters who numb their sense of emptiness with casual sex, alcohol, and drugs. 

Contemporary architecture critic [[Herbert Muschamp]] argues that "[[horror vacui]]" (which is Latin for "fear of emptiness") is a key principle of design. He claims that it has become an obsessive quality that is the "driving force in contemporary American taste". Muschamp states that "along with the commercial interests that exploit this interest, it is the major factor now shaping attitudes toward public spaces, urban spaces, and even suburban sprawl."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ho.html |title=ArtLex's Ho-Hz page |publisher=Artlex.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films that depict nothingness, shadows and vagueness, either in a visual sense or a moral sense are appreciated in genres such as [[film noir]]. As well, travellers and artists are often intrigued by and attracted to vast empty spaces, such as open deserts, barren wastelands or salt flats, and the open sea.

In visual arts emptiness and absence were recognized as phenomena that characterize not only particular works of [[art]] (e.g. [[Yves Klein]]) but also as a more general tendency within the history of [[modern art]] and [[aesthetics]]. Following [[Davor Džalto]]'s argument on the modern concept of art, the gradual elimination of particular elements that traditionally characterized [[visual arts]], which results in emptiness, is the most important phenomenon within the history and [[theory of art]] over the past two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instifdt.bg.ac.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Davor-Dzalto.pdf |title=Art: A Brief History of Absence (From the Conception and Birth, Life and Death, to the Living Deadness of Art) |publisher=Davor Džalto |date= |accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Eastern cultures==

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Śūnyatā}}
The Buddhist term ''emptiness'' (Skt. ''[[śūnyatā]]'') refers specifically to the idea that everything is [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently originated]], including the causes and conditions themselves, and even the principle of causality itself.  It is not [[nihilism]], nor is it meditating on nothingness.&lt;ref name=lamazopa&gt;Interview on Emptiness by Lama Zopa Rinpoche. Available at: http://www.lamayeshe.com/lamazopa/interview.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, it refers to the absence (emptiness) of inherent existence.  [[Buddhapalita]] says:
{{cquote |What is the reality of things just as it is? It is the absence of essence. Unskilled persons whose eye of intelligence is obscured by the darkness of delusion conceive of an essence of things and then generate attachment and hostility with regard to them.|30px|30px|{{IAST|''Buddhapālita-mula-madhyamaka-vrtti''}} P5242,73.5.6-74.1.2{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002}}}}

In an interview, the [[Dalai Lama]] stated that [[Tantra|tantric meditation]] can be used for "heightening your own realization of emptiness or [[bodhichitta|mind of enlightenment]]".&lt;ref&gt;''A Survey of the Paths of Tibetan Buddhism with His Holiness the Dalai Lama''. Available at: http://www.lamayeshe.com/otherteachers/hhdl/survey.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Buddhist philosophy]], attaining a realization of emptiness of inherent existence is key to the permanent cessation of [[suffering]], i.e. [[nirvana|liberation]].

{{cquote|Even while an ordinary being, if upon hearing of emptiness great joy arises within again and again, the eyes moisten with tears of great joy, and the hairs of the body stand on end, such a person has the seed of the mind of a complete Buddha; He is a vessel for teachings on [[tattva|thatness]], and ultimate truth should be taught to him. After that, good qualities will grow in him.|30px|30px|[[Chandrakirti]]|''Guide to the Middle Way,'' vv. 6:4-5&lt;ref&gt;translation in ''Ocean of Nectar'', pp. 151, 153&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Dalai Lama argues that tantric [[yoga]] trainees need to realize the emptiness of inherent existence before they can go on to the "highest yoga tantra initiation"; realizing the emptiness of inherent existence of the mind is the "fundamental innate mind of clear light, which is the subtlest level of the mind", where all "energy and mental processes are withdrawn or dissolved", so that all that appears to the mind is "pure emptiness". As well, emptiness is "linked to the creative Void, meaning that it is a state of complete receptivity and perfect enlightenment", the merging of the "ego with its own essence", which Buddhists call the "clear light".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plotinus.com/spiritual%20emptiness_copy.htm |title=About Spiritual Emptiness or the Void |publisher=Plotinus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ven. Thubten Chodron's 2005 interview with Lama Zopa Rinpoche, the lama noted that we "...ordinary beings who haven't realized emptiness don't see things as similar to illusions", and we do not "realize that things are merely labeled by mind and exist by mere name".&lt;ref name=lamazopa/&gt; He argues that "when we meditate on emptiness, we drop an atom bomb on this [sense of a] truly existent I" and we realize that "what appears true... isn't true". By this, the lama is claiming that what we think is real—our thoughts and feelings about people and things—"exists by being merely labeled". He argues that meditators who attain knowledge of a state of emptiness are able to realize that their thoughts are merely illusions from labelling by the mind.&lt;ref name=lamazopa/&gt;

===Taoism===
In [[Taoism]], attaining a state of emptiness is viewed as a state of stillness and placidity which is the "mirror of the universe" and the "pure mind".&lt;ref name=taopage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taopage.org/emptiness.html |title=Taoism - Wu - Emptiness |publisher=Taopage.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tao Te Ching]] claims that emptiness is related to the "Tao, the Great Principle, the Creator and Sustainer of everything in the universe". It is argued that it is the "state of mind of the Taoist disciple who follows the Tao", who has successfully emptied the mind "of all wishes and ideas not fitted with the Tao's Movement". For a person who attains a state of emptiness, the "still mind of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth, the glass of all things", a state of "vacancy, stillness, placidity, tastelessness, quietude, silence, and non-action" which is the "perfection of the Tao and its characteristics, the "mirror of the universe" and the "pure mind".&lt;ref name=taopage/&gt; In this significance, emptiness is the central theme of the artworks by the contemporary Australian artist [[David Booker]].

'''''Erasmus Montanus''''' is a satirical play about [[Academia|academic]] conceit in rural Denmark. Written by [[Ludvig Holberg]] in 1722, the script was first published in 1723 and performed in 1747.

== Plot summary ==

Rasmus Berg, a Danish farmer's son,  has been given a costly education in [[Copenhagen]]. When he returns, he speaks Latin to his parents, and Latinises his name as Erasmus Montanus. He wants to "dispute", and goes on to "prove" a number of absurdities, such as relying on [[argument from ignorance]] to prove that his mother is a rock. He is contrasted to his brother Jacob who is only interested in knowledge which is of practical application.

His persistent arguing gets him into trouble with the parents of his fiancée Lisbet, who refuses the marriage until he stops claiming that the [[Spherical Earth|Earth is round]]. His fiancée begs him to retract his statements that the Earth revolves around the sun, but he refuses. After a village plot tricks him to enlist for military service and leave the city, he reconsiders and makes the retractions, allowing him to marry Lisbet.

{{Quotation|''A village street showing Jeppe’s house. Jeppe, with a letter in his hand.''

''Jeppe.'' It is a shame that the deacon is not in town, for there's so much Latin in my son's letter that I can't understand. Tears come to my eyes when I think that a poor peasant's son has got so much book-learning, especially as we aren't tenants of the university. I have heard from people who know about learning that he can dispute with any clergyman alive. Oh, if only my wife and I could have the joy of hearing him preach on the hill, before we die, we shouldn't grudge all the money we have spent on him! I can see that Peer the deacon doesn't much relish the idea of my son's coming. I believe that he is afraid of Rasmus Berg. It is a terrible thing about these scholarly people. They are so jealous of each other, and no one of them can endure the thought that another is as learned as he. The good man preaches fine sermons here in the village and can talk about envy so that the tears come to my eyes; but it seems to me that he isn't entirely free from that fault himself. I can't understand why it should be so. If any one said that a neighbor of mine understood farming better than I, should I take that to heart? Should I hate my neighbor for that? No, indeed, Jeppe Berg would never do such a thing. But if here isn't Peer the deacon!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/5749/pg5749.html Three Plays by Holberg, Jeppe of The Hill, The Political Tinker, Erasmus Montanus - Gutenberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8492">In [[philosophy of mind]] and [[consciousness]], the '''explanatory gap''' is the difficulty that [[physicalism|physicalist]] theories have in explaining how physical properties give rise to the way things feel when they are experienced. It is a term introduced by philosopher [[Joseph Levine (philosopher)|Joseph Levine]].&lt;ref name=Levine1983 /&gt; In the 1983 paper in which he first used the term, he used as an example the sentence, "Pain is the firing of [[C fibers]]", pointing out that while it might be valid in a physiological sense, it does not help us to understand how pain feels.

The explanatory gap has vexed and intrigued [[philosopher]]s and [[artificial intelligence|AI]] researchers alike for decades and caused considerable debate. Bridging this gap (that is, finding a satisfying mechanistic explanation for experience and [[qualia]]) is known as "[[Hard problem of consciousness|the hard problem]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[David Chalmers]], [http://consc.net/papers/facing.pdf ''Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness''], [http://www.imprint.co.uk/hardprob.html JCS, 2 (3), 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514060312/http://www.imprint.co.uk/hardprob.html |date=2011-05-14 }}, pp. 200-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

To take an example of a phenomenon in which there is no gap, imagine a modern computer: as marvelous as these devices are, their behavior can be fully explained by their circuitry. By contrast, it is thought by many [[Mind-body dualism|mind-body dualists]] (e.g. [[René Descartes]], [[David Chalmers]]) that ''subjective conscious experience'' constitutes a separate effect that demands another cause that is either outside the physical world (dualism) or due to an as yet unknown physical phenomenon (see for instance [[quantum mind]], [[indirect realism]]).

Proponents of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] claim that the [[mind]] is substantially and qualitatively different from the [[brain]] and that the existence of something [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] extra-physical is required to "fill the gap".  Similarly, some argue that there are [[further facts]]—facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts of the world—about conscious experience. For example, they argue that [[qualia|what it is like]] to experience seeing red does not follow logically from the physical facts of the world.

The nature of the explanatory gap has been the subject of some debate.  For example, some consider it to simply be a limit on our current explanatory ability.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D. C. 1991. Consciousness Explained. Boston: Little, Brown and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that future findings in neuroscience or future work from philosophers could close the gap.  However, others have taken a stronger position and argued that the gap is a definite limit on our cognitive abilities as humans—no amount of further information will allow us to close it.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, C. 1989. “Can we solve the mind-body problem?” Mind, 98: 349-66&lt;/ref&gt;  There has also been no consensus regarding what metaphysical conclusions the existence of the gap provides.  Those wishing to use its existence to support dualism have often taken the position that an epistemic gap—particularly if it is a definite limit on our cognitive abilities—necessarily entails a metaphysical gap.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, D. 1996. The Conscious Mind. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Levine and others have wished to either remain silent on the matter or argue that no such metaphysical conclusion should be drawn.&lt;ref name=Levine1983&gt;Levine, J. 1983. “Materialism and qualia: the explanatory gap”. Pacific Philosophical Quarterly, 64: 354-361.&lt;/ref&gt;  He agrees that conceivability (as used in the [[philosophical zombie|Zombie]] and [[inverted spectrum]] arguments) is flawed as a means of establishing metaphysical realities; but he points out that even if we come to the ''metaphysical'' conclusion that qualia are physical, they still present an ''explanatory'' problem.
&lt;blockquote&gt;While I think this materialist response is right in the end, it does not suffice to put the mind-body problem to rest. Even if conceivability considerations do not establish that the mind is in fact distinct from the body, or that mental properties are metaphysically irreducible to physical properties, still they do demonstrate that we lack an explanation of the mental in terms of the physical.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, such an [[epistemological]] or explanatory problem might indicate an underlying metaphysical issue—the non-physicality of qualia, even if not proven by conceivability arguments is far from ruled out.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the end, we are right back where we started. The explanatory gap argument doesn't demonstrate a gap in nature, but a gap in our understanding of nature. Of course a plausible explanation for there being a gap in our understanding of nature is that there is a genuine gap in nature. But so long as we have countervailing reasons for doubting the latter, we have to look elsewhere for an explanation of the former.&lt;ref&gt;J. Levine, "Conceivability, Identity, and the Explanatory Gap" in  Stuart R. Hameroff, Alfred W. Kaszniak and David Chalmers (eds.), ''Towards a Science of Consciousness III: The Third Tucson Discussions and Debates'', The MIT Press, 1999,. pp 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the core of the problem, according to Levine, is our lack of understanding of what it means for a qualitative experience to be fully comprehended. He emphasizes that we don't even know to what extent it is appropriate to inquire into the nature of this kind of experience. He uses the laws of gravity as an example, which laws seem to explain gravity completely yet do not account for the gravitational constant. Similarly to the way in which gravity appears to be an inexplicable brute fact of nature, the case of qualia may be one in which we are either lacking essential information or in which we're exploring a natural phenomenon that simply is not further apprehensible. Levine suggests that, as qualitative experience of a physical or functional state may simply be such a brute fact, perhaps we should consider whether or not it is really necessary to find a more complete explanation of qualitative experience.

Levine points out that the solution to the problem of understanding how much there is to be known about qualitative experience seems even more difficult because we also lack a way to articulate what it means for actualities to be knowable in the manner that he has in mind. He does conclude that there are good reasons why we wish for a more complete explanation of qualitative experiences. One very significant reason is that consciousness appears to only manifest where mentality is demonstrated in physical systems that are quite highly organized. This, of course, may be indicative of a human capacity for reasoning that is no more than the result of organized functions. Levine expresses that it seems counterintuitive to accept this implication that the human brain, so highly organized as it is, could be no more than a routine executor. He notes that although, at minimum, Materialism appears to entail reducibility of anything that is not physically primary to an explanation of its dependence on a mechanism that can be described in terms of physical fundamentals, that kind of reductionism doesn't attempt to reduce psychology to physical science. However, it still entails that there are inexplicable classes of facts which are not treated as relevant to statements pertinent to psychology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1316">'''Finality''', in [[law]], is the concept that certain disputes must achieve a resolution from which no further [[appeal]] may be taken, and from which no collateral proceedings may be permitted to disturb that resolution. For example, in some jurisdictions, a person convicted of a crime may not sue their defence attorney for incompetence or [[legal malpractice]] if the civil [[lawsuit]] would call into question the finality of the criminal conviction.  Finality is considered to be important because, absent this there would be no certainty as to the meaning of the law, or the outcome of any legal process. The principle is an aspect of the separation of powers, that being a distinction between the executive and the judicial power. This concept was defined within NSW v Kable [2013]. In this case, the court explained that unless orders were valid until set aside, "the exercise of judicial power could yield no adjudication of right and liability to which immediate effect could be given". 

The importance of finality is the source of the concept of ''[[res judicata]]'' - that the decisions of one court are settled law, and may not be retried in another case brought in a different court.

'''GNU Solidario''' is a [[non-profit organization]] founded by [[Luis Falcón]] on 23 November 2009 to promote the use of [[Free Software]] in the areas of [[Public Health]] and education.

==History==
GNU Solidario origins are in [[Argentina]], with Free Software projects in the area of education in rural schools. The first mission was on 6 October 2006, in schools from [[Santiago del Estero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.gnusolidario.org/2006/10/instalacion-de-debian-gnulinux-en.html |title= Instalación de Debian GNU/Linux en Escuelas de Santiago del Estero |publisher=GNU Solidario}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The project at that time was called ''Linux Solidario''. &lt;br&gt;

That event led [[Luis Falcón]] to focus on [[Social Medicine]] and [[Public Health]], and work with health professionals and governments to improve the lives of the underprivileged. In October 2009, the organization was officially registered in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, where currently holds its headquarters.

In 2010, GNU Solidario celebrates the first edition of the International Workshop on eHealth in Emerging Economies - IWEEE -. Since then, IWEEE has been a meeting point for multilateral and humanitarian organizations such as [[Red Cross]], [[World Health Organization]], [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], [[War Child (charity)| War Child]], [[United Nations]] University or [[Caritas Internationalis]], as well as for universities around the world.

==Current projects and activities==

'''Gerard M. Verschuuren''' (nicknames Gerry and Geert) is a scientist, writer, speaker, and consultant, working at the interface of science, philosophy, and religion. He is a human biologist, specialized in human genetics, who also earned a doctorate in the [[philosophy of science]], and studied and worked at universities in Europe and the United States. In 1994, he moved permanently to the United States, and lives now in the southern part of New Hampshire.

==Studies and research==
He began studying biology at [[Leiden University]] and specialized in [[human genetics]] at [[Utrecht University]] in the Netherlands, with a thesis on the statistical analysis of [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] variation in the [[Tellem]] skulls of [[Mali]] in comparison with the Kurumba tribe of [[Burkina Faso]] (former ''Upper Volta''). After that, he became a participant of the six-member ''Human Adaptability Project'' team (led by professor [[John Huizinga]], M.D.) of the former ''Institute of [[Human biology|Human Biology]]'' at [[Utrecht University]] Medical School, as part of the [[International Biological Program]], studying the [[population genetics]] and [[adaptation]] of [[savannah]] populations in [[Subsaharan Africa|sub-saharan Africa]] based on research among the [[Fali people|Fali]] in [[Cameroun]], among the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] in [[Mali]], and among the [[Fulbe]] in [[Chad]].

Verschuuren also studied philosophy at [[Leiden University]] and wrote, under supervision of professor [[Marius Jeuken]], a thesis on the impact of the Harvard philosopher and mathematician [[Alfred North Whitehead]] on research in biology. He further specialized in [[philosophy of science]], in particular in [[philosophy of biology]], at [[VU University Amsterdam]]. Verschuuren concluded his post-graduate studies with a doctoral thesis on the use of [[Model (abstract)|models]] in the sciences. In this work, he analyzes how all sciences use models, which are simplified replicas of the dissected original, made for research purposes by reducing the complexity of the original to a manageable model related to a soluble problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://poortman.kb.nl/long2.php?TABEL=T_TITEL&amp;ID=24721 The Use of Models]&lt;/ref&gt;

Verschuuren taught biology, [[biological anthropology]], [[genetics]], [[human genetics]], [[statistics]], philosophy, [[philosophy of biology]], [[logic]], and [[Mathematical programming|programming]] at [[:nl:Aloysius College|''Aloysius College'']], [[Utrecht University]], the [[Open University (Netherlands)|Dutch Open University]], [[Merrimack College]] and [[Boston College]]. Currently, he focuses almost exclusively on writing, consulting, and on speaking engagements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.where-do-we-come-from.com Where Do We Come From?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational work ==
Verschuuren became the leader of a team of textbook writers that developed three consecutive series of biology textbooks for high-schools and colleges under the names [http://www.boekbesprekingen.nl/index.php?pilih=auteur&amp;mod=yes&amp;auteur=312777&amp;menu=Bibliografie ''Biosfeer''] (1975&amp;ndash;1983), [http://www.boekbesprekingen.nl/index.php?pilih=auteur&amp;mod=yes&amp;auteur=312777&amp;menu=Bibliografie ''Oculair''] (1984&amp;ndash;1994), and [http://www.boekbesprekingen.nl/index.php?pilih=auteur&amp;mod=yes&amp;auteur=312777&amp;menu=Bibliografie ''Grondslagen van de Biologie''](Foundations of Biology; 1985&amp;ndash;present). He also became a member of the ''College Admission Test'' team for biology in the Netherlands (1976&amp;ndash;1982).

For those specifically interested in the philosophy of biology, he wrote four textbooks: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0080320317 ''Investigating the Life Sciences: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''] (1986), [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1886670005 ''Life Scientists: Their Convictions, Their Activities, and Their Values''] (1995), [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542888484 ''The Holism-Reductionism Debate - In Physics, Genetics, Biology, Neuroscience, Ecology, Sociology''] (2016), and [https://rowman.com/ISBN/978-0-7391-7520-0 ''Darwin's Philosophical Legacy - The Good and the Not-So-Good''] (2012).

To reach fellow scientists as well, he started in cooperation with the professors Cornelis Van [[:nl:Cees van Peursen|Peursen]] and Cornelis [[:nl:Cees Schuyt|Schuyt]], both of [[Leiden University]], an overseeing editorial board for the development of 25 books on the philosophy of science for 25 specific fields, written by experts in those fields (1986&amp;ndash;present), [[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|Nijhoff]], Leiden,
[https://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=%22filosofie+van+%22+nijhoff ''Series Philosophy of the Sciences''].

During the 1970s, Verschuuren wrote a weekly column on breaking biological topics in the ''[[Volkskrant]]'' daily. He was a member of the editorial board of the Dutch philosophical magazine ''Wijsgerig Perspectief'', for which he wrote several of its articles, and a member of the editorial board of the Dutch-Flemish magazine ''Streven'', for which he also wrote articles and book reviews [http://www.streventijdschrift.be/archief.aspx (partial listing)]. All in all, he wrote many books and articles in Dutch on biological and philosophical issues [http://poortman.kb.nl/zoek2.php?begin=1&amp;eind=20&amp;VELD%5B%5D=2&amp;QUERY%5B%5D=&amp;OPERATOR%5B%5D=&amp;doc%5B%5D=4&amp;FREEQUERY=Q_NAAM3.TN_ID=6154&amp;OPDRACHT=Publicaties+van+Geert+M.N.++Verschuuren&amp;YEQ=&amp;YEAR=&amp;YEAR1=&amp;YEAR2=  (listing)].

In the 1980s, Verschuuren was an advisor to the [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990sert.book.....C Foundation Scientific Europe], which published a voluminous overview of research and technology in 20 European countries, entitled [http://openlibrary.org/b/OL1775400M/Scientific_Europe ''Scientific Europe''] (edited by [[Nigel Calder]]). From 1985 until 1994, he was the editor-in-chief of the Dutch magazine [[:nl:Natuurwetenschap en Techniek|''Natuurwetenschap en Techniek'']] and publisher of the Dutch version of the ''Scientific American Library''.

== Consulting work ==
Verschuuren assisted scientists and engineers in using computers for [[data analysis]], [[statistical analysis]], and [[regression analysis]]. He became a [[Microsoft Certified Professional]] and was an official adviser on Excel's latest statistical functions (2010).

Verschuuren has done consulting work for many companies, including [[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott]], [[Astrazeneca|AstraZeneca]], [[Babson college|Babson College]], [[Bose Corporation|Bose]], [[Boston Scientific]], [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], [[Commerce Insurance Group|Commerce]],  [[List of biotechnology companies|Cubist Pharmaceuticals]], [[Emerson Process Management|Emerson]], [[Harvard University|Harvard U.]], [[Intel|Intel Corporation]], [[John Hancock Insurance|John Hancock]], [[IBM]], Keystone Trading, Lantheus [[Medical imaging|Medical Imaging]], [[Liberty Mutual Group|Liberty Mutual]], [[Pfizer]], [[Mass General|Mass. General Hospital]], [[Millennium Pharmaceuticals]], [[MIT]], [[Rockwell Automation]], [[Sepracor]], [[Siemens]],  [[Staples Inc|Staples]], [[Teradyne]], and [[Wyeth]].

On request of [[MrExcel]], he has developed a series of more than 10 interactive CDs and DVDs to help scientists and more general users to become familiar with programs such as [[Visual Basic for Applications]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#.NET]]. These interactive tools are great for visual learners - completely visualized, full-color, and with frequent self checks [http://www.mrexcel.com/microsoft-office-visual-learning.html (listing)]. In addition, he wrote [https://www.amazon.com/VBA-VSTO-Excels-Engine-Right/dp/1932802142/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368099610&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=gerard+verschuuren ''From VBA to VSTO''] (2006), [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1978429878 ''130 Excel Simulations in Action''] (2017), [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1540445178 ''100 Excel VBA Simulations''] (2017), and [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1615470255 ''Excel for Scientists''] (2005, 2008, and 2013).

He also created many informative [http://www.genesispc.com/links.htm#videos videos] to help scientists manage data on their PCs or laptops.

== At the interface of science and religion ==
A practicing Catholic, Verschuuren is interested in the relationship between [[science and religion]]. It is his conviction that religion and science cannot be in conflict with each other and cannot be seen as a threat to each other, as long as both stay in their own territory,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Gould, Rocks of Ages (New York: Ballantine Books, 2002), 207–208.&lt;/ref&gt; which prevents us from turning science into a pseudo-religion, or religion into a semi-science. Put in the words of [[Augustine of Hippo]]&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, Enarrationes in Psalmos, 45, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Galileo Galilei]],&lt;ref&gt;Galileo in his 1632 Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems&lt;/ref&gt; science reads the "Book of Nature" and religion reads the "Book of Scripture," for they both have the same Author, GOD.

From this perspective, grounded in the tradition of Thomas Aquinas, he has written several books:
* ''Darwin's Philosophical Legacy - The Good and the Not-So-Good''. There is hardly any university, college, or even high school left where they do not teach [[Darwinism]]—and rightly so. Yet, most of these places do more preaching than teaching. In what the author likes to call "The Good" parts of his legacy, he explores what Darwin's great contributions are to the study of evolution and to the theory of evolution. At the same time, he also delves into the areas where his thoughts were not so perfect or even wrong, especially in a philosophical sense—which he calls "The Not-So-Good" parts of his legacy. There are definitely two sides to Darwin's legacy and they need to be carefully balanced.
* ''God and Evolution - Science Meets Faith''. This book discusses the issue of [[Evolution and creation in public education|evolution and creation]] from a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] viewpoint, while avoiding the flaws and traps of the theory of [[Intelligent design|''Intelligent Design'']]. It is a book for all who want to learn more about the science behind evolution in a way that does not detract from their deeply held faith but actually strengthens it. Lost in the raging debate about creation and evolution is the profound Catholic truth, affirmed by Popes and theologians from the earliest Church to today, that faith can never conflict with the truths of science—not even evolution.
* ''What Makes You Tick? - A New Paradigm for [[Neuroscience]]''. In the first chapters, he argues that it is not molecules, DNA, or not even neurons that make you "tick." This is obviously contrasted with the current [[paradigm]] of neuroscience. The current paradigm of neuroscience—which he now calls the "old" paradigm—is too materialistic, too deterministic, and too reductionistic to do justice to the unique position of living human beings in the world. It calls for a more comprehensive paradigm!
* ''Of All That Is, Seen and Unseen - Life-Saving Answers to Life-Size Questions''. This book belongs basically to the genre of [[Christian apologetics|apologetics]] and evangelization, thoroughly rooted in the Catholic tradition, with a mild philosophical touch based on the tradition of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Because this book has basically a format of question-and-answer, the text is most engaging to the reader. Each chapter can be read independently and can be used as an outline for discussions and seminars.
* ''The Destiny of the Universe - In Pursuit of the Great Unknown''. This book is not about astronomy, not even about science per se, but about the Great Unknown beyond and behind all that we can see through our telescopes and microscopes. Although, there is a lot of science in this book, at a simplified level, it is mainly a critical philosophical journey, starting in the world of science, but ultimately in pursuit of the Great Unknown that has become more and more known in the lives of so many people.
*''It's All in the Genes! - Really?''. A decade ago, the general estimate for the number of human genes was thought to be well over 100,000, but then turned out to be around 30,000 genes—which is only half again as many genes as a tiny roundworm needs to manufacture its utter simplicity. And human beings have only 300 unique genes not found in mice. No wonder that the president of Celera, a bio-corporation, said about this surprising finding "This tells me genes cannot possibly explain all of what makes us what we are." At least, we have a first indication here that genes are not as almighty as some want us to believe.
*''Five Anti-Catholic Myths - Slavery, Crusades, Inquisition, Galileo, Holocaust''. The myths analyzed in this book claim to lay bare the "dirty history" of the Catholic Church. Well, the Catholic Church's "dirty history" is not that dirty at all. As Pope Leo XIII once said, the Catholic Church has no reason to fear historical truth. Yet, some Catholics as well as many non-Catholics often see history through a lens that has been shaped by post-Reformation propaganda or by 18th century Enlightenment prejudices. These myths served a purpose then, but they still serve a purpose in today's secularist climate of progress and scientism. But does that really validate them? Scholarship of recent decades, however, has thrown new light on these matters, and is finally allowing the truths of history to become more widely known.
*''Life's Journey - From Conception to Growing Up, Growing Old, and Natural Death''. This book describes the six main phases of life's journey in more or less detail. Some of these stages the reader may have gone through already; others are still ahead of them. They may not be able to retrace previous stages, but they are probably anxious to know what is ahead of them. And besides, they may have children who are going through earlier stages and parents who are experiencing later stages. Each chapter discusses one specific stage of life's journey. Every chapter begins with a biological description of that period in life, followed by a more philosophical reflection. One cannot be without the other. We need facts before we can reflect, but facts without reflection are meaningless.
*''Matters of Life and Death - A Catholic Guide to the Moral Dilemmas of Our Time''. We live in a time of very divergent opinions about right and wrong, life and death, sexuality and sex, pro-life and pro-choice, prolonging life and shortening life. We all wonder what can help us to pilot through the raging waters of this turbulent ocean. Where do we find sound judgments in the midst of these debates? What we need more than ever is a moral compass. 
*''Aquinas and Modern Science - A New Synthesis of Faith and Reason''. What could Aquinas ever contribute to our time, some seven centuries later? One of the main reasons is that there are many similarities between his time and our time, between his world and our world. His thirteenth century world was as turbulent as ours is. His world was confronted with an influx of new ideas coming from the Muslim world; our world is constantly being inundated with new ideas, particularly coming from scientists. His world saw the sudden rise of universities; our world sees an explosion of sciences and their sub-disciplines. His time was marked by dubious philosophies; our time has been infiltrated with skepticism and relativism. His era was a time of tremendous change; ours is also in permanent instability. His world had lost faith in reason; ours has too. Aquinas understood both the fascination of his contemporaries with new discoveries and new ideas and the very mixed feelings that come with all of that. So he would understand our time too.
*''The Holism-Reductionism Debate - In Physics, Genetics, Biology, Neuroscience, Ecology, Sociology''. This book is intended for those working in, or preparing for, research in any scientific field — ranging from the physical sciences to the life sciences to the behavioral sciences and the social sciences. It is certainly not meant for people specialized in areas dealing with the specific issue of reductionism in a strict philosophical sense; they won't learn much new from this book. Philosophers have the task of questioning and analyzing what most other people, including scientists, usually take for granted. For that reason, this book is basically a plea against dogmatism in science, in favor of a more open-minded approach. Dogmas do not belong in science, but they do occur in the scientific community.
*''The Myth of an Anti-Science Church - Galileo, Darwin, Teilhard, Hawking, Dawkins''. What do these five scientists have in common? General perception has it that something went wrong between them and the Catholic Church. Is that true, or are we dealing with a fabrication? If it is true, what exactly went wrong between them? This book analyzes these five "cases" in their confrontation with the Catholic Church. Usually the Church ends up being the villain. But what about these scientists themselves? One could make the case that all five of them have something like a double personality: the personality of the scientist and the personality of the ideologist hiding behind the scientist.
*''At the Dawn of Humanity - The First Humans''. This book investigates in the first five chapters how genes may change from generation to generation — before, during, and after the dawn of humanity. Next the book discusses how much these mechanisms can explain of what many people consider unique to humanity: the faculties of language, rationality, morality, self-awareness, and religion. Are those features really unique, or did they come from the non-human animal world? Were the first humans able to use language, to think rationally, to act morally, to know who they were, and to know there is a God? The answer may surprise you.
*''Faith and Reason - The Cradle of Truth''. The reciprocal relationship between faith and reason has been a constant theme in Catholic intellectual history, and it explains why the Catholic intellectual tradition is so rich, strong and full, perhaps unlike anything else in the world. In his famous Regensburg address and elsewhere, Pope Benedict XVI stressed the perennial relevance of Pope John Paul II's encyclical ''Fides et Ratio'' (Faith and Reason) and the need for Faith to purify Reason, and for Reason to purify Faith.
*''Forty Anti-Catholic Lies''. Catholics are believed to have certain beliefs "out of line" with mainstream thinking. However, those beliefs are often caricatures that are misrepresentations of the real beliefs Catholics hold. What do Catholics really believe? Asking any Catholic is not always the best way to find out, for some Catholics may not even know the finer details of their own faith, or they have already been affected by the misinformation that keeps bombarding them.
*''The Eclipse of God''. This book was specifically written for all those who feel lost in a world dominated by ideologies that obscure God. It is hard to pinpoint one particular cause of how we feel in such Godforsaken times and places, but science is likely one of the main perpetrators.

'''''God in the Age of Science?: A Critique of Religious Reason''''' is a 2012 book by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[philosopher]] [[Herman Philipse]], written in [[English language|English]] and published in the [[United Kingdom]]. Philipse found his ''[[Atheïstisch manifest|Atheist Manifesto]]'' (1995) to be too hastily and superficially written, and decided to set up a more complete work to systematically refute all the arguments for the [[existence of God]] and adherence to any form of [[theism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5116/Filosofie/article/detail/3252309/2012/05/08/Het-hoofdstuk-God-is-nu-wel-gesloten.dhtml |title='Het hoofdstuk God is nu wel gesloten' |author=Wilfred van de Poll |work=[[Trouw]] |date=8 May 2012 |accessdate=21 February 2015 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/dossier-brieven/alles-aan-geloof-in-god-is-irrationeel~a3821951/ |title=Alles aan geloof in God is irrationeel |author=Klaas Landsman |work=[[de Volkskrant]] |date=3 January 2015 |accessdate=21 February 2015 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To gain insight in how a religious person substantiates the existence of [[God]], Philipse presents a "religious [[decision tree]]" that leads to four categories of theists. He starts by asking:

Is the statement "God exists" a factual truth claim?
# If not, somebody claims that God does not factually exists, but is merely a [[metaphor]]. Defenders of this position are, according to Philipse, following the tradition of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], and are currently represented by people like [[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips|D.Z. Phillips]]&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips|Phillips, D.Z.]]}}, ''Problem of Evil and the Problem of God'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karen Armstrong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[Karen Armstrong|Armstrong, Karen]]}}, ''The Case for God'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
# If yes, is it necessary to invoke any kind of ([[logic]]al) argumentation or ([[empiricism|empirical]]) evidence to back up this truth claim?
## If not, somebody claims that God factually exists, but that one may assert this without invoking any kind of argumentation or evidence. [[Alvin Plantinga]] is among those defending this position, aiming to explain the world in the case God exists, which itself remains a matter of faith (an axiom or [[presuppositional apologetics|presupposition]], according to Plantinga).&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[Alvin Plantinga|Plantinga, Alvin]]}}, ''Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;
## If yes, does this argumentation or evidence need to be [[science|scientific]] in nature (to have gone through the [[scientific method]]), and is there no possibility to completely achieve a proof of God through one's own standards?
### If not, somebody claims that God factually exists, and that one can prove this, but not in a scientific manner. Defenders of this position make use of what Philipse calls "typically religious arguments", such as [[revelation]], [[religious text]]s, [[religious experience]], [[prayer]], [[Glossolalia|speaking in tongues]], a [[convulsion]] with foam at the mouth etc. Although himself an [[agnostic]], the evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] described this point of view as [[non-overlapping magisteria]] (NOMA):&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, Stephen J.]]}}, ''[[Rocks of Ages|Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]]'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; science and religion are two entirely different enterprises and have nothing to say about each other; therefore, science cannot assess the existence of God. The opposite of this is the [[god of the gaps]] argument, namely that if science can't explain any given phenomenon, religion can, often by postulating a god.
### If yes, somebody claims that God factually exists, and that his existence can be demonstrated using [[scientific evidence]]. This position is held by people like [[Richard Swinburne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[Richard Swinburne|Swinburne, Richard]]}}, ''The Existence of God'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen D. Unwin,&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Unwin, Stephen D.}}, ''The Probability of God'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; who, for example, try to show the probability of God's existence using [[Bayes' theorem]]. The [[intelligent design movement]] (ID) claimed to possess scientific evidence for the traditional divine [[creation myth|creation]] myth that would refute the [[theory of evolution]] (among other scientific facts). Aside from ID, there are many other [[creationism|creationist movements]] with scientific pretenses.

Next, Philipse tries to refute arguments from every category step by step, but especially from the last case, namely Bayes' theorem as used by Swinburne. Based on his critiques of the last two cases ("God is [[supernatural]]" and "God's existence is within reach of [[natural theology]]") he concludes that:&lt;ref&gt;

# God's existence is a meaningless predicate, according to the definitions of [[substance dualism|substance dualists]] and supernaturalists. (See also, [[theological noncognitivism]]).
# If theism were meaningful, it would have no [[predictive power]] upon the existing evidence, because theists render the claim [[unfalsifiable]] every time evidence on the contrary is explained away with responses like "God works in mysterious ways" (See also the [[problem of evil]]). Therefore Bayesian arguments are inapplicable.
# Therefore, because neither strategy is [[epistemology|epistemologically]] satisfactory, one should conclude that atheism is a more principled position than theism.

{{Emotion}}

'''Jealousy''' generally refers to the thoughts or feelings of insecurity, fear, concern, and envy over relative lack of possessions, status or something of great personal value, particularly in reference to a comparator, a rival, or a competitor. 

Jealousy can consist of one or more emotions such as [[anger]], [[resentment]], inadequacy{{how|date=October 2018}}, helplessness or [[disgust]]. In its original meaning, ''jealousy'' is distinct from [[envy]], though the two terms have popularly become synonymous in the [[English language]], with ''jealousy'' now also taking on the definition originally used for envy alone.

Jealousy is a typical experience in [[Interpersonal relationship|human relationships]], and it has been observed in infants as young as five months.&lt;ref name="Draghi-Lorenz,2000"&gt;Draghi-Lorenz, R. (2000). Five-month-old infants can be jealous: Against cognitivist [[solipsism]]. Paper presented in a symposium convened for the XIIth Biennial International Conference on Infant Studies (ICIS), 16–19 July, [[Brighton|Brighton, UK]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart,2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S | year = 2002 | title = Jealousy in 6-month-old infants | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–402 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0303_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart,2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = When infants lose exclusive maternal attention: Is it jealousy? | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 57–78 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0601_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shackelford"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shackelford | first1 = T.K. | last2 = Voracek | first2 = M. | last3 = Schmitt | first3 = D.P. | last4 = Buss | first4 = D.M. | last5 = Weekes-Shackelford | first5 = V.A. | last6 = Michalski | first6 = R.L. | year = 2004 | title = Romantic jealousy in [[Adult|early adulthood]] and in later life | url = | journal = Human Nature | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 283–300 | doi=10.1007/s12110-004-1010-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers claim that jealousy is seen in all cultures.&lt;ref name="Buss,2000"&gt;Buss, D.M.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=eEXfY9SD2ycC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=lobi+africa+jealousy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9IoGYkIPeV&amp;sig=K4HcJ7u6vChouLCYR6XBDG52jA8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result The Psychology of Jealousy and Envy]. 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-89862-555-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jealousy can either be '''suspicious''' or '''reactive''',&lt;ref&gt;Rydell RJ, Bringle RG Differentiating reactive and suspicious jealousy ''Social Behavior and Personality An International Journal'' 35(8):1099-1114 Jan 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and it is often reinforced as a series of particularly strong emotions and constructed as a universal human experience. [[Psychologist]]s have proposed several models to study the processes underlying jealousy and have identified factors that result in jealousy. [[Sociologist]]s have demonstrated that cultural beliefs and values play an important role in determining what triggers jealousy and what constitutes socially acceptable expressions of jealousy. [[Biologist]]s have identified factors that may unconsciously influence the expression of jealousy.

Throughout history, artists have also explored the theme of jealousy in photographs, paintings, films, songs, plays, poems, and books, and [[theologian]]s have offered religious views of jealousy based on the scriptures of their respective faiths.

== Sexual jealousy ==
{{main|Sexual jealousy}}

Sexual jealousy may be triggered when a person's significant other displays sexual interest in another person.&lt;ref name="BuunkHupka"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buunk | first1 = Bram | last2 = Hupka | first2 = Ralph B | year = 1987 | title = Cross-Cultural Differences in the Elicitation of Sexual Jealousy | url = | journal = The Journal of Sexual Research | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 12–22 | doi=10.1080/00224498709551338}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feeling of jealousy  may be just as powerful if one partner suspects the other is guilty of [[infidelity]]. Fearing that their partner will experience sexual jealousy the person who has been unfaithful may lie about their actions in order to protect their partner. Experts often believe that sexual jealousy is in fact a biological imperative. It may be part of a mechanism by which humans and other animals ensure access to the best reproductive partners.

It seems that male jealousy in heterosexual relationships may be influenced by their female partner's phase in her menstrual cycle. In the period around and shortly before ovulation, males are found to display more mate-retention tactics, which are linked to jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.robertburriss.com/pdfs/burriss_06_ehb.pdf|title = Effects of partner conception risk phase of male perception of dominance in faces|last = Burriss, R., &amp; Little, A.|first = |date = 2006|journal = Evolution and Human Behavior|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a male is more likely to employ mate-retention tactics if their partner shows more interest in other males, which is more likely to occur in the pre-ovulation phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1690982/pdf/12028782.pdf|pmc = 1690982|title = Changes in women’s sexual interest and their partner's mate retention tactics across the menstrual cycle: evidence for shifting conflicts of interest|last = Gangestad, S.

== Romantic jealousy ==
Romantic jealousy arises as a result of romantic interest. It is defined as “''a complex of thoughts, feelings, and actions that follow threats to self-esteem and/or threats to the existence or quality of the relationship when those threats are generated by the perception of a real or potential romantic attraction between one's partner and a (perhaps imaginary) rival.''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Gregory L.|date=1 December 1981|title=A model of romantic jealousy|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00992549|journal=Motivation and Emotion|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=295–310|doi=10.1007/BF00992549|issn=0146-7239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different from sexual jealousy, romantic jealousy is triggered by threats to self and relationship (rather than sexual interest in another person). Factors, such as feelings of inadequacy as a partner, sexual exclusivity, and having put relatively more effort into the relationship, are positively related to relationship jealousy in both genders.

=== Communicative responses ===
As romantic jealousy is a complicated reaction that has multiple components, i.e., thoughts, feelings, and actions, one aspect of romantic jealousy that is under study is communicative responses. Communicative responses serve three critical functions in a romantic relationship, i.e., reducing uncertainty, maintaining or repairing relationship, and restoring self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero|first=Laura K.|last2=Andersen|first2=Peter A.|last3=Jorgensen|first3=Peter F.|last4=Spitzberg|first4=Brian H.|last5=Eloy|first5=Sylvie V.|date=1 December 1995|title=Coping with the green‐eyed monster: Conceptualizing and measuring communicative responses to romantic jealousy|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10570319509374523|journal=Western Journal of Communication|volume=59|issue=4|pages=270–304|doi=10.1080/10570319509374523|issn=1057-0314}}&lt;/ref&gt; If done properly, communicative responses can lead to more satisfying relationships after experiencing romantic jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salovey|first=Peter|last2=Rodin|first2=Judith|date=1 March 1988|title=Coping with Envy and Jealousy|url=http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.1988.7.1.15|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=15–33|doi=10.1521/jscp.1988.7.1.15|issn=0736-7236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bringle|first=Robert G|last2=Renner|first2=Patricia|last3=Terry|first3=Roger L|last4=Davis|first4=Susan|date=1 September 1983|title=An analysis of situation and person components of jealousy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092656683900260|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=17|issue=3|pages=354–368|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(83)90026-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two subsets of communicative responses: interactive responses and general behavior responses. Interactive responses is face-to-face and partner-directed while general behavior responses may not occur interactively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Guerrero and colleagues further categorize multiple types of communicative responses of romantic jealousy. Interactive responses can be broken down to six types falling in different places on continua of threat and directness:
* Avoidance/Denial (low threat and low directness). ''Example: becoming silent; pretending nothing is wrong.''
* Integrative Communication (low threat and high directness). ''Example: explaining feelings; calmly questioning partner.''
* Active Distancing (medium threat and medium directness). ''Example: decreasing affection.''
* Negative Affect Expression (medium threat and medium directness). ''Example: venting frustration; crying or sulking.''
* Distributive Communication (high threat and high directness). ''Example: acting rude; making hurtful or abrasive comments.''
* Violent Communication/Threats (high threat and high directness). ''Example: using physical force.'' 
Guerrero and colleagues have also proposed five general behavior responses. The five sub-types differ in whether a response is 1) directed at partner or rival(s), 2) directed at discovery or repair, and 3) positively or negatively valenced:
* Surveillance/ Restriction (rival-targeted, discovery-oriented, commonly negatively valenced). ''Example: observing rival; trying to restrict contact with partner.''
* Rival Contacts (rival-targeted, discovery-oriented/repair-oriented, commonly negatively valenced). ''Example: confronting rival.''
* Manipulation Attempts (partner-targeted, repair-oriented, negatively valenced). ''Example: tricking partner to test loyalty; trying to make partner feel guilty.''
* Compensatory Restoration (partner-targeted, repair-oriented, commonly positively valenced). ''Example: sending flowers to partner.''
* Violent Behavior (-, -, negatively valenced). ''Example: slamming doors.''
While some of these communicative responses are destructive and aggressive, e.g., distributive communication and active distancing, some individuals respond to jealousy in a more constructive way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero|first=Laura K.|last2=Trost|first2=Melanie R.|last3=Yoshimura|first3=Stephen M.|date=1 June 2005|title=Romantic jealousy: Emotions and communicative responses|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1350-4126.2005.00113.x/abstract|journal=Personal Relationships|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=233–252|doi=10.1111/j.1350-4126.2005.00113.x|issn=1475-6811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrative communication, compensatory restoration, and negative affect expression have been shown to lead to positive relation outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bevan|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Lannutti|first2=Pamela J.|date=1 June 2002|title=The experience and expression of romantic jealousy in same‐sex and opposite‐sex romantic relationships|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824090209384854|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=19|issue=3|pages=258–268|doi=10.1080/08824090209384854|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor that affects the type of communicative responses elicited in an individual is emotions. Jealousy anger is associated with more aggressive communicative response while irritation tends to lead to more constructive communicative behaviors.

== Gender-based differences ==

According to the Parental Investment Model based on [[parental investment]] theory, more men than women ratify sex differences in jealousy. In addition, more women over men consider emotional infidelity (fear of abandonment) as more distressing than sexual infidelity.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} According to the attachment theory, sex and attachment style makes significant and unique interactive contributions to the distress experienced. Security within the relationship also heavily contributes to one’s level of distress. These findings imply that psychological and cultural mechanisms regarding sex differences may play a larger role than expected (Levy, Blatt, Schachner.) The attachment theory also claims to reveal how infants' attachment patterns are the basis for self-report measures of adult attachment. (Levy, Blatt &amp; Shaner, 1998). Although there are no sex differences in childhood attachment, individuals with dismissing behavior were more concerned with the sexual aspect of relationships (Schachner &amp; shaer, 2004). As a coping mechanism these individuals would report sexual infidelity as more harmful. Moreover, research shows that  audit attachment styles strongly  conclude with the type of infidelity that occurred. Thus psychological and cultural mechanisms are implied as unvarying differences in jealousy that play a role in sexual attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Rydell, McConnell, Bringle 2004, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional jealousy was predicted to be nine times more responsive in females than in males. The emotional jealousy predicted in females also held turn to state that females experiencing emotional jealousy are more violent than men experiencing emotional jealousy.

There are distinct emotional responses to gender differences in romantic relationships (Buss, Green &amp; Saboni 2004). For example, due to paternity uncertainty in males, jealousy increases in  males over sexual infidelity rather than emotional. According to research more  women are likely to be upset by signs of resource withdraw (i.e. another female) than by sexual infidelity.  A large amount of data{{which|date=April 2013}} supports this notion. However, one must consider  for jealousy the life stage or experience one encounters in reference to the diverse responses to infidelity available. Research states that a componential view of jealousy consist of specific set of emotions that serve  the reproductive role.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} However, research shows that both men and women would be equally angry and point the blame for sexual infidelity, but women would be more hurt by emotional infidelity. Despite this fact, anger surfaces   when both parties involved is responsible for some type of uncontrollable behavior, sexual conduct is not exempt. (Sabbini and Silver, Averill 1995). Some behavior and actions are controllable such as sexual behavior. However hurt feelings are activated by relationship deviation. No evidence is known to be sexually dimorphic in both college and adult convenience samples. The Jealousy Specific Innate Model (JSIM) proved to not be innate, but may be sensitive to situational factors. As a result, it may only activate at stages in on. One study discovered serious relationships are reserved for older adults rather than undergraduates.  For example, Buss ''et al.'' (1992) predicted that male jealousy decreases as females reproductive values decreases.

A second possibility that the JSIM effect is not innate but is from one culture (Desieno ''et al.'', 2002) Kitayana (2004) have highlighted differences in socio-economic status specific such as the divide between high school and collegiate individuals. Moreover, individuals of both genders were angrier and blamed their partners more for sexual infidelities but were more hurt by emotional (Sabini &amp; Green 2004). Jealousy is composed of lower-level emotional states (e.g., anger and hurt) which may be triggered by a variety of events, not by differences in individuals' life stage. Although research has recognized the importance of early childhood experiences for the development of competence in intimate relationships, early family environment is recently being examined as well (Richardson and Guyer, 1998). Research on self-esteem and attachment theory  suggest that individuals internalize early experiences within the family which subconsciously translates into their personal view of worth of themselves and the value of being close to other individuals, especially in an interpersonal relationship (Steinberg, Davila, &amp; Fincham, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Green, Sabini 2006, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researches at the University of California, San Diego, replicated jealousy studies done on humans on canines.  They reported, in a paper published in PLOS ONE in 2014, that  a significant number of dogs exhibited jealous behaviors when their human companions paid attention to dog-like toys, compared to when their human companions paid attention to nonsocial objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Jealousy in Dogs|url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094597|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 23 July 2014|pmc = 4108309|pmid = 25054800|pages = e94597|volume = 9|issue = 7|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0094597|first = Christine R.|last = Harris|first2 = Caroline|last2 = Prouvost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word stems from the French ''jalousie'', formed from ''jaloux'' (jealous), and further from  [[Vulgar Latin|Low Latin]] ''zelosus'' (full of zeal), in turn from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ζήλος}} (''zēlos''), sometimes "jealousy", but more often in a positive sense "emulation, ardour, zeal"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=jealousy&amp;searchmode=none Jealous], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2346217 Zelos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus
&lt;/ref&gt;
(with a [[Root (linguistics)|root]] connoting "to [[boil]], [[Fermentation (food)|ferment]]"; or "yeast"). The "biblical language" zeal would be known as "tolerating no unfaithfulness" while in middle English zealous is good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/jealous|title=jealous {{!}} Origin and meaning of jealous by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One origin word ''gelus'' meant "Possessive and suspicious" the word then turned into ''jelus.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/jealous|title=jealous {{!}} Origin and meaning of jealous by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since [[William Shakespeare]]'s use of terms like "green-eyed monster",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Othello]]'', Act III, Scene 3, 170&lt;/ref&gt; the color green has been associated with jealousy and envy, from which the expressions "green with envy", are derived.

== Theories ==

=== Scientific definitions ===

People do not express jealousy through a single emotion or a single behavior.&lt;ref name="Darwin,1872"&gt;Darwin, C. (1872). The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clanton, Smith"&gt;Clanton, G. &amp; Smith, L. (1977) Jealousy. New Jersey: Prentice- Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buunk,1984"&gt;Bram Buunk, B. (1984). Jealousy as related to attributions for the partner's behavior. [[Social psychology|Social Psychology]] Quarterly, 47, 107–112.&lt;/ref&gt;
They instead express jealousy through diverse emotions and behaviors, which makes it difficult to form a scientific definition of jealousy. Scientists instead define jealousy in their own words, as illustrated by the following examples:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Romantic jealousy is here defined as a complex of thoughts, feelings, and actions which follow threats to [[self-esteem]] and/or threats to the existence or quality of the relationship, when those threats are generated by the perception of potential attraction between one's partner and a (perhaps imaginary) rival." (White, 1981, p. 24)&lt;ref name="White,1981"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = G.L. | year = 1981 | title = Jealousy and partner's perceived motives for attraction to a rival | url = | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 24–30 | doi=10.2307/3033859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Jealousy, then, is any aversive reaction that occurs as the result of a partner's extradyadic relationship that is considered likely to occur." (Bringle &amp; Buunk, 1991, page 135)&lt;ref name="Bringle, Buunk"&gt;Bringle, R.G. &amp; Buunk, B.P. (1991). Extradyadic relationships and [[sexual jealousy]].  In K. McKinney and S. Sprecher (Eds.), Sexuality in Close Relationships (pp. 135-153) Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Jealousy is conceptualized as a cognitive, emotional, and behavioral response to a relationship threat. In the case of sexual jealousy, this threat emanates from knowing or suspecting that one's partner has had (or desires to have) [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] with a third party. In the case of emotional jealousy, an individual feels threatened by her or his partner's emotional involvement with and/or love for a third party." (Guerrero, Spitzberg, &amp; Yoshimura, 2004, page 311)&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Spitzberg, Yoshimura,2004"&gt;Guerrero, L.K., Spitzberg, B.H., &amp; Yoshimura, S.M. (2004).  Sexual and Emotional Jealousy.  In J.H. Harvey, S. Sprecher, and A. Wenzel (Eds.), The Handbook of Sexuality in Close Relationships (pp. 311-345). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Jealousy is defined as a defensive reaction to a perceived threat to a valued relationship, arising from a situation in which the partner's involvement with an activity and/or another person is contrary to the jealous person's definition of their relationship." (Bevan, 2004, page 195)&lt;ref name="Bevan,2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bevan | first1 = J.L. | year = 2004 | title = General partner and relational uncertainty as consequences of another person's jealousy expression | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 195–218 | doi=10.1080/10570310409374796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Jealousy is triggered by the threat of separation from, or loss of, a romantic partner, when that threat is attributed to the possibility of the partner's romantic interest in another person." (Sharpteen &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1997, page 628)&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen, Kirkpatrick"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharpsteen | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Kirkpatrick | first2 = L.A. | year = 1997 | title = Romantic jealousy and adult romantic attachment | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 627–640 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These definitions of jealousy share two basic themes. First, all the definitions imply a triad composed of a jealous individual, a partner, and a perception of a third party or rival. Second, all the definitions describe jealousy as a reaction to a perceived threat to the relationship between two people, or a dyad. Jealous reactions typically involve aversive emotions and/or behaviors that are assumed to be protective for their attachment relationships. These themes form the essential meaning of jealousy in most scientific studies.

==== Comparison with envy ====

Popular culture uses the word jealousy as a synonym for [[envy]]. Many dictionary definitions include a reference to envy or envious feelings. In fact, the overlapping use of jealousy and envy has a long history.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The terms are used indiscriminately in such popular 'feelgood' books as Nancy Friday's ''Jealousy'', where the expression 'jealousy' applies to a broad range of passions, from envy to lust and greed. While this kind of usage blurs the boundaries between categories that are intellectually valuable and psychologically justifiable, such confusion is understandable in that historical explorations of the term indicate that these boundaries have long posed problems. Margot Grzywacz's fascinating etymological survey of the word in Romance and [[Germanic languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Margot Grzywacz, "Eifersucht" in den romanischen Sprachen (Bochum-Langendreer, Germany: H. Pöppinghaus, 1937), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; asserts, indeed, that the concept was one of those that proved to be the most difficult to express in language and was therefore among the last to find an unambiguous term. [[Classical Latin]] used ''invidia'', without strictly differentiating between envy and jealousy. It was not until the postclassical era that Latin borrowed the late and poetic Greek word ''zelotypia'' and the associated adjective ''zelosus''. It is from this adjective that are derived French ''jaloux'', Provençal ''gelos'', Italian ''geloso'', and Spanish ''celoso''. (Lloyd, 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=71snX5ZkX10C&amp;pg=PA4 page 4])&lt;ref name="Lloyd"&gt;Lloyd, R. (1995). Closer &amp; Closer Apart: Jealousy in Literature. Ithaca, NY: [[Cornell University|Cornell University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Perhaps the overlapping use of jealousy and envy occurs because people can experience both at the same time. A person may envy the characteristics or possessions of someone who also happens to be a romantic rival.&lt;ref name="Parrot, Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parrot | first1 = W.G. | last2 = Smith | first2 = R.H. | year = 1993 | title = Distinguishing the experiences of envy and jealousy | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 906–920 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.6.906}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, one may even interpret romantic jealousy as a form of envy.&lt;ref name="Kristjansson,2002"&gt;Kristjansson, K. (2002). Justifying Emotions: Pride and Jealousy.&lt;/ref&gt; A jealous person may envy the affection that his or her partner gives to a rival — affection the jealous person feels entitled to himself or herself. People often use the word jealousy as a broad label that applies to both experiences of jealousy and experiences of envy.&lt;ref name="Smith, Kim, Parrott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = R.H. | last2 = Kim | first2 = S.H. | last3 = Parrott | first3 = W.G. | year = 1988 | title = Envy and jealousy: Semantic problems and experiential distinctions | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 401–409 | doi=10.1177/0146167288142017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although popular culture often uses jealousy and envy as synonyms, modern philosophers and psychologists have argued for conceptual distinctions between jealousy and envy. For example, philosopher [[John Rawls]]&lt;ref name="Rawls"&gt;Rawls, J. (1971). [[A Theory of Justice]]. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[Harvard University Press|Belknap Press]] of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes between jealousy and envy on the ground that jealousy involves the wish to keep what one has, and envy the wish to get what one does not have. Thus, a child is jealous of her parents' attention to a sibling, but envious of her friend's new bicycle. Psychologists Laura Guerrero and Peter Andersen have proposed the same distinction.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen"&gt;Guerrero, L.K., &amp; Andersen, P.A. (1998). The dark side of jealousy and envy: desire, delusion, desperation, and destructive communication. In W.R. Cupach and B.H. Spitzberg (Eds.), The Dark Side of Close Relationships, (pp. ). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; They claim the jealous person "perceives that he or she possesses a valued relationship, but is in danger of losing it or at least of having it altered in an undesirable manner," whereas the envious person "does not possess a valued commodity, but wishes to possess it." Gerrod Parrott draws attention to the distinct thoughts and feelings that occur in jealousy and envy.&lt;ref name="Parrot 92"&gt;Parrott, W.G. (1992). The emotional experiences of envy and jealousy. In [[Peter Salovey|P. Salovey]] (Ed.), The Psychology of Jealousy and Envy (pp. 3–29). New York, NY: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{Citation|last=Staff |first=P.T. |title=A devastating difference |journal=Psychology Today |date=Jan–Feb 1994 |id=Document ID 1544 |accessdate=2006-07-08 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19940101-000017.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427112226/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19940101-000017.html |archivedate=27 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common experience of '''jealousy''' for many people may involve:

:* Fear of loss
:* Suspicion of or anger about a perceived betrayal
:* Low self-esteem and sadness over perceived loss
:* Uncertainty and loneliness
:* Fear of losing an important person to another
:* Distrust

The experience of '''envy''' involves:

:* Feelings of inferiority
:* Longing
:* Resentment of circumstances
:* Ill will towards envied person often accompanied by guilt about these feelings
:* Motivation to improve
:* Desire to possess the attractive rival's qualities
:* Disapproval of feelings

Parrot acknowledges that people can experience envy and jealousy at the same time. Feelings of envy about a rival can even intensify the experience of jealousy.&lt;ref name="Pines, Aronson,1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pines | first1 = A. | last2 = Aronson | first2 = E. | year = 1983 | title = Antecedents, correlates, and consequences of sexual jealousy | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 108–136 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1983.tb00857.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the differences between envy and jealousy in terms of thoughts and feelings justify their distinction in philosophy and science.

=== In psychology ===

Jealousy involves an entire "emotional episode," including a complex "narrative": the circumstances that lead up to jealousy, jealousy itself as emotion, any attempt at [[Self control|self regulation]], subsequent actions and events and the resolution of the episode (Parrott, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;306). The narrative can originate from experienced facts,  thoughts, perceptions, memories, but also imagination, guess and assumptions. The more society and culture matter in the formation of these factors, the more jealousy can have a social and cultural origin. By contrast, Goldie (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;228) shows how jealousy can be a "cognitively impenetrable state", where education and rational belief matter very little.

One possible explanation of the origin of jealousy in [[evolutionary psychology]] is that the emotion evolved in order to maximize the success of our genes: it is a biologically based emotion (Prinz after Buss and Larsen, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;120) selected to foster the certainty about the paternity of one’s own offspring. A jealous behavior, in men, is directed into avoiding sexual betrayal and a consequent waste of resources and effort in taking care of someone else’s offspring. There are, additionally, cultural or social explanations of the origin of jealousy. According to one, the narrative from which jealousy arises can be in great part made by the imagination. Imagination is strongly affected by a person's cultural milieu. The pattern of reasoning, the way one perceives situations, depends strongly on cultural context. It has elsewhere been suggested that jealousy is in fact a secondary emotion in reaction to one's needs not being met, be those needs for attachment, attention, reassurance or any other form of care that would be otherwise expected to arise from that primary romantic relationship.

While mainstream psychology considers [[sexual arousal]] through jealousy a [[paraphilia]], some authors on sexuality (Serge Kreutz, ''Instrumental Jealousy'') have argued that jealousy in manageable dimensions can have a definite positive effect on [[sexual function]] and sexual satisfaction. Studies have also shown that jealousy sometimes heightens passion towards partners and increases the intensity of passionate sex.&lt;ref&gt;Emotions and sexuality. In K. McKinney and S. Sprecher (Eds.), ''Sexuality, in close relationships'' (pp. 49–70). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pines"&gt;Pines, A. (1992). ''Romantic jealousy: Understanding and conquering the shadow of love''. New York: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jealousy in children and teenagers has been observed more often in those with low self-esteem and can evoke aggressive reactions. One such study suggested that developing intimate friends can be followed by emotional insecurity and loneliness in some children when those intimate friends interact with others. Jealousy is linked to aggression and low self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb05/jealousy.html |title=Study links jealousy with aggression, low self-esteem |publisher=Apa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Sybil Hart, Ph.D., at Texas Tech University indicates that children are capable of feeling and displaying jealousy at as young as six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | last2 = Carrington | first2 = H. | year = 2002 | title = Jealousy in six-month-old infants | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–402 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0303_6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants showed signs of distress when their mothers focused their attention on a lifelike doll. This research could explain why children and infants show distress when a sibling is born, creating the foundation for sibling rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | last2 = Carrington | first2 = H. | last3 = Tronick | first3 = E. Z. | last4 = Carroll | first4 = S. | year = 2004 | title = When infants lose exclusive maternal attention: Is it jealousy? | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 57–78 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0601_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In sociology ===
{{Main|Social aspects of jealousy}}

Anthropologists have claimed that jealousy varies across cultures. [[Cultural learning]] can influence the situations that trigger jealousy and the manner in which jealousy is expressed. Attitudes toward jealousy can also change within a culture over time. For example, attitudes toward jealousy changed substantially during the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. People in the United States adopted much more negative views about jealousy. As men and women became more equal it became less appropriate or acceptable to express jealousy.

=== In fiction, film, and art ===

[[File:Miyagawa Isshô-Spring Pastimes-H.jpg|thumb|275px|A Japanese painting from 1750 shows a young woman catching her lover reading a [[love letter]] from a [[Competition|rival]].]]

[[Jealousy in art|Artistic depictions of jealousy]] occur in fiction, films, and other art forms such as painting and sculpture. Jealousy is a common theme in literature, art, theatre, and film. Often, it is presented as a demonstration of particularly deep feelings of love, rather than a destructive obsession.

=== In religion ===
{{Main|Jealousy in religion}}

Jealousy in religion examines how the scriptures and teachings of various religions deal with the topic of jealousy. Religions may be compared and contrasted on how they deal with two issues: concepts of divine jealousy, and rules about the provocation and expression of human jealousy.

The Christian [[New Testament]] records that the Jewish [[Kohen|chief priests]] and elders had handed [[Jesus]] over to [[Pontius Pilate]] to be [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]] because they were jealous of his popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:18|NKJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|15:10|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese name|[[Jiang (surname)|Jiang (蒋)]]}}
'''Jiang Qing''' ({{zh|s=蒋庆|t=蔣慶|p=Jiǎng Qìng}}; born 1953) is a contemporary [[China|Chinese]] [[Confucian]]. He is best known for his criticism of [[New Confucianism]], which according to him, deviated from the original Confucian principles and is overly influenced by Western [[liberal democracy]]. He proposes an alternative path for China: Constitutional Confucianism, also known as Political Confucianism, or Institutional Confucianism, through the trilateral parliament framework.

He believes that China’s ongoing political and social problems are to be solved by the revival of and commitment to authentic [[Confucianism]] in China. He also argues that Confucian materials should replace the [[Marxist]] curriculum taught in universities and government party schools.&lt;ref&gt;Xiuping Hong, "The Characteristics and Prospect of the Confucian Academy: A Commentary on Jiang Qing’s Ideas on the Confucian Academy.", ''The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China'', edited by Ruiping Fan, Springer (June 9, 2011), hardcover, 275 pages, {{ISBN|9400715412}} {{ISBN|978-9400715417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

For more than two thousand years, [[Confucianism]] has helped to define [[Chinese culture]], tradition, and philosophy; it has contributed to a stable and harmonious society. The Chinese people held a very distinctive notion of the state, family, and social relationships such as ''guanxi''. Nevertheless, challenges from foreign powers and internal problems in the country inevitably led to the political [[revolution of 1911|Xinhai Revolution]] when the people overthrew the [[Qing Dynasty]]. Fundamental changes to the orientation of the culture were necessary for China to continue to strive in the modern world. In the attempt to save Confucian morality, philosophers such as [[Liang Shuming]], [[Tang Junyi]], and [[Mou Zongsan]] advocated [[New Confucianism]], which arguably came out as the byproduct of philosophical synthesis between Chinese and the Western values. Jiang believes this is problematic because it neglects the institutional dimension of the traditional [[Confucianism]], or the ''wangdao'' (kingly system). In short, [[New Confucianism]] is not authentic due to its insistence on projecting [[Confucianism]] in terms of the modern Western political institution of [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Jiang Qing, "From Mind Confucianism to Political Confucianism.", ''The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China'', edited by Ruiping Fan, Springer (June 9, 2011), hardcover, 275 pages, {{ISBN|9400715412}} {{ISBN|978-9400715417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Jiang Qing was born October 1, 1953 in [[Guiyang]] to a relatively affluent family. As a child, he had a passion for Chinese poetry and classical literature. The political situation at the time drove him to undertake studies of [[Marxism]] and [[human rights]] theories of the West during his university years. Later on, perplexed by China’s political reality, he studied both eastern and western religion. Eventually, he studied [[New Confucianism]], which on the one hand advocates the mind philosophy and self-cultivation, and on the other hand tries to fit Confucian ideologies into the framework of Western [[liberal democracy]]. Given his deep appreciation and knowledge of the classics, especially the [[Gongyang Zhuan]] commentary, and the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], he was determined to find a solution for China’s struggles. He believed that an embrace of Western ideas, especially democratic politics, liberty, and equality, is not suitable for China’s development. This brought about his criticism of the [[New Confucianism]], and his plan for China, which involved drawing on its own long-standing metaphysical moral and political values, as well as national identity, all of which are fundamentally different from Western ideologies. He also founded the [[Yangming Academy]] ([[:zh:阳明精舍]]), a Confucian-based educational institution in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Yu and Meng Fan, "A Confucian Coming of Age." Chapter 15 in Section III, "A Note on Jiang Qing", ''The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China'', edited by Ruiping Fan, Springer (June 9, 2011), hardcover, 275 pages, {{ISBN|9400715412}} {{ISBN|978-9400715417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of New Confucianism==

Arguing that [[New Confucianism]] is exclusively concerned with the existential life of human individuals and their minds, Jiang calls it Mind Confucianism, perhaps to highlight how it focuses on individual moral development rather the Chinese institutional aspect that [[Gongyang Zhuan]] advocates, more specifically the idea of ''wangdao'' (王道 "kingly way; benevolent government"),&lt;ref&gt;[[John DeFrancis]] (2003), ''ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary'', University of Hawaii Press, p. 974.&lt;/ref&gt; loosely translated as “Way of the Humane Authority.”&lt;ref&gt;This Chinese word ''wangdao'' "kingly way" was used in [[Japanese propaganda during World War II#China|Japanese propaganda during World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt; Succinctly, ''wangdao'' is a set of criteria for which a legitimate ruler meets. It consists mainly of three parts: transcendence (from heaven), history and culture (from earth) and the will (from human). These conditions essentially ensure an orderly society, in which the people dutifully obey their rightful ruler. In short, [[New Confucianism]] is not authentic for it incorrectly attempts to project [[Confucianism]] in terms of modern Western political institution of [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jiang Qing, From Mind Confucianism to Political Confucianism.&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, Jiang claims that there are problems with [[New Confucianism]]. First, it overtly focuses on the ideas of individuality and self-cultivation, causing familial and social relations to collapse. In this respect, [[New Confucianism]] fails to recognize how traditional social institutions can help transform individuals into sages. Secondly, it excessively emphasizes the abstract metaphysical concepts. This makes New Confucians blind to practical social and political reality. Thirdly, New Confucians believe that through individuals’ self-cultivation of virtue, external social and political problems will be solved. Because of this, they do not comprehend the critical role of ritual and legal systems in alleviating sociopolitical problems. Finally, under the assumption that the human mind exists outside of space and time [[New Confucianism]] resorts to [[transcendentalism]]. This lack of attention to history causes New Confucians to be unaware of the sociopolitical reality. Moreover, it betrays the Confucian spirit, for Confucius held that human beings exist at a point in historical and social reality; it is vital that they be defined by socio-political relationships according to the rites. Among other things, the fact that [[New Confucians]] predominantly draw on Mind Confucianism has made them oblivious to the values of Political Confucianism, a strand in which Jiang uses as the basis for his alternative solution. Moreover, Jiang believes New Confucians have inappropriately blended Western ideas of science and liberal democracy that are neither compatible with Confucianism, nor the Chinese society.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Ruichang, "The Rise of Political Confucianism in Contemporary China.", ''The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China'', edited by Ruiping Fan, Springer (June 9, 2011), hardcover, 275 pages, {{ISBN|9400715412}} {{ISBN|978-9400715417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Confucianism and Rejection of Western idea of ‘Equality’==
Political Confucianism, as opposed to Mind Confucianism, concerns society and social relations. As it comes from the Han dynasty text [[Gongyang Zhuan]], it reflects a version of Confucianism concerned with politics and governing. Also, whereas Mind Confucianism assumes that humans are innately good, Political Confucianism more cautiously employs institutional systems to condemn bad human behaviors and immoral politics, thereby nurturing individuals to become principled beings. Moreover, it pays attention to historical lessons and strives to find a rightful form of governance, as illustrated by the idea of ''wangdao''. In deriving his solution, Jiang is hugely influenced by this concept. 
Moreover, Jiang rejects the Western concept of “equality,” an idea that propagates [[liberal democracy]]. From the Confucian point of view, people are unequal—as they differ in virtue, intelligence, knowledge, ability, etc. Hence, it is not plausible to give everyone equal rights without considering their standings. Also, while every individual should be bounded by the law, this does not mean that everyone should have equal legal rights or obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiping Fan, "Jiang Qing on Equality", ''The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China'', edited by Ruiping Fan, Springer (June 9, 2011), hardcover, 275 pages, {{ISBN|9400715412}} {{ISBN|978-9400715417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Way of the Humane Authority==
The Way of the Humane Authority as justification of political power is based on Confucian principles outlined in the [[Gongyang Zhuan]], one the [[Three Commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals]]: the legitimacy of heaven (a sacred, transcendent sense of natural morality), the legitimacy of earth (wisdom from history and culture), and the legitimacy of the human (political obedience through popular will).&lt;ref name=NYT71012&gt;{{cite news|title=A Confucian Constitution for China|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/opinion/a-confucian-constitution-in-china.html|accessdate=July 12, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 10, 2012|author=Jiang Qing|author2=Daniel A. Bell|format=Oped co-authored by subject|quote=According to the Gongyang Zhuan, a commentary on a Confucian classic, political power can be justified through three sources: the legitimacy of heaven (a sacred, transcendent sense of natural morality), the legitimacy of earth (wisdom from history and culture), and the legitimacy of the human (political obedience through popular will).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Trilateral Parliament as the solution===
Jiang has proposed a trilateral parliament system for China, which would consist of three houses, each representing the three kinds of legitimacy discussed in Criticism of [[New Confucianism]]. “The three are the House of Exemplary Persons (Tongru Yuan), also called the House of Ru or the House of Confucian Tradition, which represents sacred legitimacy; the House of the People (Shumin Yuan), which represents popular legitimacy; and the House of the Nation (Guoti Yuan), which represents cultural legitimacy.” The Confucian scholars in the House of Exemplary Persons are elected by recommendations and nominations. Representatives from [[Daoism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], or even [[Christianity]] are also present in the House. The members in the House of People are elected by universal suffrage. The members in the House of Nation are chosen by hereditary criteria and by assignment. Each house possesses real parliamentary power, and the bill must be accepted by at least two house, in order for it to become a law. In a way, this produces a system of checks and balances to guarantee that the best decision is reached, and that no party is overly dominant. All in all, the constitutional framework is supposed to endorse the Way of the Humane Authority. It has more dimensions of political legitimacy than liberal democracy, where only the people’s will is reflected in the consent of the government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT71012 /&gt;

==Reception of Jiang’s ideology==

Jiang’s work has triggered debates in the academic circle. Some scholars, for example Ruichang Wang, agree with Jiang’s criticism of liberal democracy and his proposal of the trilateral parliament regime. They believe that in the future, the idea will gain more support. Daniel A. Bell, another supporter of Jiang, agrees that in order for a political transition to become successful in the long run, it must draw on the existing cultural resources, i.e. Political Confucianism, in China’s case. Similar to Wang, he believes that Jiang’s proposal of the trilateral parliament system is promising, but there needs to be some modification for it to become feasible and more effective. The will of the people should not be the only parameter considered when making decisions. Yet, it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of the legitimacy from sacred sources or historical continuity.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Bell, "Jiang Qing's Political Confucianism.", ''The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China'', edited by Ruiping Fan, Springer (June 9, 2011), hardcover, 275 pages, {{ISBN|9400715412}} {{ISBN|978-9400715417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Immanuel Kant}}

'''Kantianism''' is the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], a [[Germans|German]] philosopher born in [[Königsberg]], [[Prussia]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], [[Russia]]). The term "Kantianism" or "Kantian" is sometimes also used to describe contemporary positions in [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], and [[ethics]].

== Ethics ==
{{Main|Kantian ethics}}
[[Kantian ethics]] are [[deontological]], revolving entirely around duty rather than emotions or end goals. All actions are performed in accordance with some underlying [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] or principle, which are vastly different from each other; it is according to this that the moral worth of any action is judged. Kant's ethics are founded on his view of rationality as the ultimate good and his belief that all people are fundamentally rational beings. This led to the most important part of Kant's ethics, the formulation of the [[categorical imperative]], which is the criterion for whether a maxim is good or bad.

Simply put, this criterion amounts to a [[thought experiment]]: to attempt to universalize the maxim (by imagining a world where all people necessarily acted in this way in the relevant circumstances) and then see if the maxim and its associated action would still be conceivable in such a world. For instance, holding the maxim ''kill anyone who annoys you'' and applying it universally would result in a world which would soon be devoid of people and without anyone left to kill. Thus holding this maxim is irrational as it ends up being impossible to hold it.

Universalizing a maxim (statement) leads to it being valid, or to one of two contradictions — a contradiction in conception (where the maxim, when universalized, is no longer a viable means to the end) or a contradiction in will (where the will of a person contradicts what the universalization of the maxim implies). The first type leads to      a "perfect duty", and the second leads to an "imperfect duty."

Kant's ethics focus then only on the maxim that underlies actions and judges these to be good or bad solely on how they conform to reason. Kant showed that many of our common sense views of what is good or bad conform to his system but denied that any action performed for reasons other than rational actions can be good (saving someone who is drowning simply out of a great pity for them is not a morally good act). Kant also denied that the consequences of an act in any way contribute to the moral worth of that act, his reasoning being (highly simplified for brevity) that the physical world is outside our full control and thus we cannot be held accountable for the events that occur in it.

The Formulations of the [[Categorical Imperative]]:

# Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W. Ellington |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals |edition=3rd |publisher=Hackett|year=1993|page=30|isbn=0-87220-166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W.

#Therefore, every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends.&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W.

==Political philosophy==
In [[political philosophy]], Kant has had wide and increasing influence with major political philosophers of the late twentieth century. For example,  [[John Rawls]] {{citation needed|date=November 2015}} drew heavily on his inspiration in setting out the basis for a [[Liberalism|liberal]] view of political institutions.{{clarify | date = November 2015 | reason = | What inspiration? What is Rawls's view? What is Kant's view? How are the two views reconciled in Liberal thought? }} The nature of Rawls' use of Kant has engendered serious controversy  {{ clarify | date = November 2015 | reason = | What nature? What controversy? |}} but has demonstrated the vitality of Kantian considerations across a wider range of questions than was once thought plausible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26893">The following is a list of international standards that are relevant to the protection of children in migration and mobility. These standards are legally binding conventions, treaties and directives. The international legal framework concerning children in migration and mobility provides safeguards in relation to asylum and international protection, labour regulations, the prevention of sexual exploitation and trafficking in human beings, international standards for migrant workers, child victims of crime and the judiciary, as well as international private law for child protection and family matters.

==International==
International standards of the United Nations, once adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, are open to signature and ratification by UN Member States worldwide. When a national government ratifies a Convention, the standards afforded under the Convention have to be reflected in national law and policy and become thereby applicable law in the country. The same procedure of ratification applies to the Conventions of the Council of Europe and the Hague Conference of Private International Law. In addition to the Member States of these inter-governmental organisations, non-Member States can also accede to the Conventions.

===The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ===
The [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] defines the human rights of children and the correlated obligations of states. It provides also for obligations of parents and caregivers, public authorities, private service providers and the private sector. These rights and obligations can guide caseworkers and case officers in all measures, decisions and considerations for children on the move. The Convention supports caseworkers and officers in navigating the complex body of international, European and national laws. It provides the overarching framework and the strongest point of reference for safeguarding children.

The Convention is complemented by three Optional Protocols, one on the [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography|sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography]], another one on the [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict|involvement of children in armed conflict]], and a third and more recent Protocol on a communications procedure for children.&lt;ref&gt;https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/signature/2012/CTC_4-11d.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; States that have ratified the Convention report to the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the international Treaty Body mandated to monitor the implementation of the Convention by States Parties. The Committee reviews and comments on State Party reports on the implementation of the Convention and develops General Comments, in which it elaborates on specific articles of the Convention.

===The Hague Conference on Private International Law===
The [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]] (HCCH) is a global inter-governmental organisation that has developed standards for the transnational cooperation on child protection and family matters. The key themes addressed by the Conventions of the Hague Conference include transnational child protection, inter-country adoption, cross-border parental child abduction as well as matters of parental responsibility and contact involving different countries.

The Hague Conventions in the area of transnational child protection and family law have several common characteristics. They ensure the automatic mutual recognition of official decisions taken by one Contracting State in other Contracting States. They enable and facilitate the cooperation between the Contracting States, including through the establishment of central authorities and the development of unified procedures. By facilitating practical matters, such as the translation of documents, information exchange and the use of standardised model forms, the Conventions aim to simplify and expedite cross-border procedures and the enforcement of official decisions.

The Hague Conventions are innovative as they work primarily with the concept of ‘habitual residence’ of the child, rather than ‘nationality’, in order to determine which state has the jurisdiction over a case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hcch.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The UN Refugee Convention and its Protocol ===
The UN Refugee Convention and its Protocol regulate the right of persons to seek international protection. Children enjoy special safeguards and have a right to have their asylum application examined individually. Child-specific grounds of persecution need to be considered irrespective of whether the child applies alone or together with a parent or caregiver. The European Union Member States have re-elaborated these standards for the EU context and have adopted a series of Directives regulating the qualification and reception conditions of asylum seekers in the EU as well as asylum procedures and matters of return.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commissioner for Refugees, Guidelines on International Protection, Child Asylum Claims, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Council of Europe ==

===The European Social Charter===
The [[European Social Charter]] sets out rights and freedoms and establishes a supervisory mechanism mandated to monitor how States Parties implement the Charter in practice. The rights afforded under the Charter concern all individuals in their daily lives as they relate, for instance, to housing, health, education, employment, legal and social protection, free movement of persons and non-discrimination. The Charter was first adopted in 1961 and was subsequently revised. The 1996 revised European Social Charter entered into force in 1999.

The European Committee of Social Rights issued in October 2015 a Statement of interpretation on the rights of refugees under the European Social Charter, which provides guidance on the application of the European Social Charter to refugees and asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/socialcharter/Presentation/AboutCharter_en.asp#Les_droits_garantis_par_la_Charte&lt;/ref&gt;

===Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (2007)===
The [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] is the first instrument to establish the various forms of sexual abuse and exploitation of children as criminal offences, including abuse committed in the home or family, with the use of force, coercion or threats. Preventive measures outlined in the Convention include the screening, recruitment and training of persons working in contact with children, making children aware of the risks and teaching them to protect themselves, as well as monitoring measures for offenders and potential offenders.

The Convention also establishes programmes to support victims, encourages people to report suspected sexual exploitation and abuse, and sets up telephone and internet helplines for children. It ensures that certain types of conduct are classified as criminal offences, such as engaging in sexual activities with a child below the legal age and the sexual exploitation of children in prostitution and pornography. The Convention criminalises the solicitation of children for sexual purposes (grooming) and by travelling sex offenders who can be prosecuted for some offences even when the act is committed abroad. The Convention ensures that child victims are protected during judicial proceedings, for example with regard to their identity and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/201&lt;/ref&gt;

===Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005)===
The [[Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]] is a comprehensive treaty mainly focused on the protection of victims of trafficking and the safeguard of their rights. It also aims at preventing trafficking as well as prosecuting traffickers. The Convention applies to all forms of trafficking; whether national or transnational, whether or not related to organised crime and whoever the victim, women, men or children and whatever the form of exploitation, sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, or other.

The Convention provides for the setting up of an independent monitoring mechanism (GRETA), which monitors the States Parties’ compliance with its provisions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/197 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==

===Directives – EU law===
Within the European Union, EU Directives are legally binding and constitute EU law that needs to be transposed into the national law of Member States within a prescribed period of time. When countries infringe against or violate European standards that are in force within the country, the European Courts offer the possibility to seek legal remedy and to claim the rights afforded under international or European law.

====Reception Conditions Directive====
The ''Council Directive 2003/9/EC of 27 January 2003 laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers'' sets out minimum reception standards for asylum applicants. The aim is to ensure that the applicants have a dignified standard of living and that comparable living conditions are afforded to them in all Member States. At the same time, the Directive also limits asylum applicants’ secondary movements.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:l33150&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asylum Procedures Directive====
The ''Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection'' repealed Directive 2005/85/EC on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status in European Union countries and sets up EU-wide procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection (refugee status and the protection given to people who are not refugees but who would risk serious harm if returned to their country of origin).&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:23010502_1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qualification Directive====
The full name of the Qualification Directive is the ''Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted''.

The Qualification Directive establishes common grounds to grant international protection. Its provisions also foresee a series of rights on protection from non refoulement, residence permits, travel documents, access to employment, access to education, social welfare, healthcare, access to accommodation, access to integration facilities, as well as specific provisions for children and vulnerable persons.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32011L0095
&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Dublin Regulation|Dublin III Regulation]]====
With the full name [[Dublin Regulation|''Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person'']].

Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 (Dublin III Council Regulation), replacing Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 (Dublin II Regulation), lays down the criteria and mechanisms for determining which EU country is responsible for examining an asylum application.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:23010503_1 
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return Directive====
The ''Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals'' establishes common standards and procedures for EU countries, whereby illegally staying non-EU nationals may be removed from their territories. It lays down provisions for terminating illegal stays, detaining non-EU nationals with the aim of removing them and procedural safeguards.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:jl0014
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family Reunification Directive====
The purpose of the ''Council Directive 2003/86/EC of 22 September 2003 on the right to family reunification'' is to determine the conditions under which non-EU nationals residing lawfully on the territory of EU countries may exercise the right to family reunification. The Directive aims to establish common rules of law relating to the right to family reunification. The intention is to enable family members of non-EU nationals residing lawfully on the territory of the European Union (EU) to join them in the EU country in which they are residing. The objective is to protect the family unit and to facilitate the integration of nationals of non-member countries. The Directive does not apply to Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom. In addition, it does not preclude any more favourable conditions recognised by national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:l33118
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conditions of admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service====
The aim of the ''Council Directive 2004/114/EC of 13 December 2004 on the conditions of admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service'' is to harmonise national legislation relating to the conditions of admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:l33163a

''Council Directive 2004/81/EC of 29 April 2004 on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities'' states that residence permits of temporary duration may be issued to non-EU nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or (optionally) the subject of an illegal immigration action. It is hoped that this will encourage them to cooperate with the competent authorities whilst providing them with adequate protection.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444940491483&amp;uri=URISERV:l33187&lt;/ref&gt;

====Victims’ Directive====
''Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JH'' establishes minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime ensures that persons who have fallen victim of crime are recognised, treated with respect and receive proper protection, support and access to justice. The Directive replaces the 2001 Framework Decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings and considerably strengthens the rights of victims and their family members to information, support and protection and victims' procedural rights in criminal proceedings. The Directive also requires that the Member States ensure appropriate training on victims' needs for officials who are likely to come into contact with victims and encourage cooperation between Member States and coordination of national services of their actions on victims' rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1421925131614&amp;uri=CELEX:32012L0029&lt;/ref&gt;

It facilitates the application of the Dublin II Regulation, which makes it possible to determine the European Union (EU) country responsible for examining an asylum application.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l33081&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicting mandates==
In the public debate on international migration, the mandates and interests of different agencies and disciplines can sometimes appear to be in conflict. International human rights standards provide the common basis for decision makers. In the context of children, the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] provides the basis for promoting the best interests of children in all contexts and situations.

==Non-legally binding standards==
In addition to legally binding conventions, treaties and directives, the UN, the Council of Europe and the European Union have developed a large number of political recommendations, regulations and guidelines, which are not legally binding but have nonetheless an important value as they aid in the interpretation and implementation of legal standards.

Couples '''living apart together''' ('''LAT''') have an intimate relationship but live at separate addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Strohm CQ, Seltzer JA, Cochran SD, Mays VM |title="Living Apart Together" relationships in the United States |journal=Demogr Res |volume=21 |issue= |pages=177–214 |year=2009 |pmid=21566723 |pmc=3091814 |doi= 10.4054/demres.2009.21.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Why do intimate partners live apart?

Within Asia, "walking marriages" have been increasingly common in [[Beijing]]. Guo Jianmei, director of the center for women's studies at Beijing University, told a [[Newsday]] correspondent, "Walking marriages reflect sweeping changes in Chinese society." A "walking marriage" refers to a type of temporary marriage formed by the [[Mosuo]] of China, in which male partners live elsewhere and make nightly visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gargan|first=Edward A.|title=China's New Brides Put Freedom First/All perks, no work in 'walking marriages'|page=A.04|work=[[Newsday]]|date=19 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar arrangement in [[Saudi Arabia]], called [[Nikah Misyar|misyar marriage]], also involves the husband and wife living separately but meeting regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karam|first=Souhail|title=Misyar offers marriage-lite in strict Saudi society|agency= Reuters| date = 21 July 2006|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/07/21/misyar_offers_marriage_lite_in_strict_saudi_society/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218200946/http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/07/21/misyar_offers_marriage_lite_in_strict_saudi_society/|archivedate=18 February 2009|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Some researchers have seen living apart together as a historically new family form. From this perspective LAT couples can pursue both the intimacy of being in a couple and at the same time preserve autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levin I | year = 2004 | title = Living Apart Together: A New Family Form | url = | journal = Current Sociology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 223–240 | doi=10.1177/0011392104041809}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some LAT couples may even de-prioritize couple relationships and place more importance on friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roseneil S | year = 2006 | title = On Not Living with a Partner: Unpicking Coupledom and Cohabitation | url = | journal = Sociological Research Online | volume = 11 | issue = 3| page = 3 | doi=10.5153/sro.1413}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, others see LAT as just a 'stage' on the way to possible cohabitation and marriage. In this view LATs are not radical pioneers moving beyond the family, rather they are cautious and conservative, and simply show a lack of commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haskey J, Lewis J | year = 2006 | title = Living-apart-together in Britain: context and meaning | url = | journal = International Journal of Law in Context | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 37–48 | doi=10.1017/s1744552306001030}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition many may simply be modern versions of 'steady' or long term boy/girlfriends.&lt;ref&gt;Ermisch, J. &amp; Siedler, T. (2009) Living Apart Together. IN Brynin, M. &amp; Ermisch, J. (Eds.) Changing Relationships. New York and London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research using more comprehensive data suggests LAT couples are a heterogeneous social category with varying motivations for living apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duncan S, Phillips M | year = 2010 | title = People who live apart together (LATs) – how different are they? | url = | journal = The Sociological Review | volume = 58 | issue = 1| pages = 112–134 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-954x.2009.01874.x| hdl = 10454/4485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  About a third see their relationship as too early for cohabitation, while others are prevented from living together, although they wish to do so, because of constraints like housing costs or (more rarely) job location. Many, however, prefer not to live together even though they have a long term relationship and could do so if they wanted. In practice motivations are often complex, for example one partner might wish to preserve the family home for existing children while the other might welcome autonomous time and space. Sometimes 'preference' can have a defensive motivation, for example the emotional desire to avoid the recurrence of a failed or unpleasant cohabiting relationship. Overall, LAT couples may be 'gladly apart; 'regretfully apart' or, for many, undecided and ambivalent where they experience both advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roseneil S | year = 2006 | title = On Not Living with a Partner: Unpicking Coupledom and Cohabitation | url = | journal = Sociological Research Online | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–14 | doi=10.5153/sro.1413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
People living apart from their partner can be found in all age groups, although they are on average younger than cohabiting and married couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haskey J, Lewis J | year = 2006 | title = Living-apart-together in Britain: context and meaning | url = | journal = International Journal of Law in Context | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 37–48 | doi=10.1017/s1744552306001030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roseneil, S. (2006) On Not Living with a Partner: Unpicking Coupledom and Cohabitation. ''Sociological Research Online'', 11 (3); Duncan, S. and Phillips, M. (2008) 'New families? Tradition and change in partnering and relationships' in British Social Attitudes 2007/8, London, NatCen, Sage&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain almost 50% of LAT couples are in the youngest age group (18–24) although significant proportions are found in the 25–55 age group. Non-parents (those without current dependent children) are significantly more likely than parents to live apart from their partner. LAT couples are also found in all socio-economic groups, and in Britain show little difference to the class profile of the population as a whole.

== In the life course ==

Living in LAT relationships means different things at different stages of the life course. Many LAT relationships among young adults and among adults with coresident, dependent children are temporary and involuntary.&lt;ref name="Connidis et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Connidis IA, Borell K, Karlsson SG | year = 2017 | title = Ambivalence and Living Apart Together in Later Life: A Critical Research Proposal| url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 79 | issue = 5 | pages = 1404–1418 | doi=10.1111/jomf.12417}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Living Apart Together in Later Life (LLAT) are generally a stable alternative to living with a partner.&lt;ref  name="Connidis et al" /&gt; Among older persons, priorities shift as the responsibilities of raising children and paid work diminish and a limited future increases a preference for affectively rich relationships. LLAT is well suited to this process. The low level of organization of LLAT relationships and the absence of many of the commitments and ties that characterize marriage put the focus on the emotional side of the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karlsson SG, Borell K  | year = 2002 | title = Intimacy and autonomy, gender and ageing | url = | journal = Ageing International| volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 11–26 |doi=10.1007/s12126-002-1012-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender also shapes the appeal of LLAT. Swedish research showed that older women were significantly more motivated to live apart together to secure independence and avoid a traditional gendered division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karlsson SG, Borell K| year = 2005 | title = A home of their own:Women's boundary work in LAT-relationships| url = | journal = Journal of Aging Studies| volume = 19 | pages = 73–84 |doi=10.1016/j.aging.2004.03.008 | doi-broken-date = 2018-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attitudes ==
Living apart as a couple is increasingly understood and accepted.  By 2006, in Britain, a majority (54 per cent) agreed that "a couple do not need to live together to have a strong relationship", with only 25 per cent disagreeing.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, S. and Phillips, M. (2008) 'New families? Tradition and change in partnering and relationships' in British Social Attitudes 2007/8, London, NatCen, Sage&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000 about one fifth of people aged 16–44 in Britain described 'living together apart' as their 'ideal relationship', compared to over 40 per cent for exclusive marriage and just under 20 per cent for unmarried cohabitation.&lt;ref&gt;Erens, B., McManus, S., Prescott, A., Field, J. with Johnson, A.M., Wellings, K., Fenton, K.A., Mercer, C., Macdowall, W., Copas, A.J. and Nanchahal, K., (2003), National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles II: Reference tables and summary report, London: NatCen/UCL/ LSHTM.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attitudinally, LATs couples themselves resemble cohabitants in a 'young partners' group, as opposed to a more conservative 'older married' majority.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, S. and Phillips, M. (2010) 'People Who Live Apart Together (LATs) - How Different Are They?' The Sociological Review 58 (1): 112-134.&lt;/ref&gt; Controlling for age LATs appear to be somewhat more liberal than other relationship categories for issues that directly affect them, for example about the effect of independence in relationships. However, for other controversial 'family' issues (like acceptance of same-sex partnership or of single motherhood) being a LAT in itself makes little difference, rather it is the relative traditionality of older married people that stands out compared to generally younger, and more liberal, unmarried cohabitants and LAT couples.

== Examples of couples who LAT ==
Famous and celebrity couples are often named in the media when discussing LAT. 
For example, a 2007 ''Times'' article&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, R. (2007) Couples that live apart . . . stay together, ''The Times'', Sat 12 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; names [[Woody Allen]] and [[Mia Farrow]] (then living either side of [[Central Park]], [[New York City]]), [[Margaret Drabble]] and [[Michael Holroyd]] (married 36 years as of 2018, separate homes), [[Helena Bonham Carter]] and [[Tim Burton]] and their two children (two houses next door to each other in [[Hampstead]], [[London]]), and [[Booker prize]]winner [[Arundhati Roy]] and husband [[Pradip Krishen]] (with separate homes in [[Delhi]], [[India]]).

In the 1840s, the famous composer [[Frédéric Chopin]] and the female novelist [[George Sand]] had an "unusual" relation that would be called LAT nowadays. The LAT relationship between philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (1905–1980) and the feminist writer [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) is often cited (although was exceptional in that Sartre apparently made other contemporaneous, if temporary, liaisons). It is important to remember, however, that it is not just the rich and famous who live apart together, LAT is common amongst ordinary people in all social groups.

The documentary ''Two's a Crowd'' documents a New York City couple that was forced to give up a LAT relationship because of the economic downturn of the late 2000s. The film depicts how the couple tries to set up two separate "apartments" within one, after they are forced to move in with each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gloamingpictures.com/crowd.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manresa Jesuit Spiritual Renewal Centre''' is a centre for [[Ignatian spirituality]] run by the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Pickering, Ontario]]. It was founded in 1924 and was built in 1945. It is situated next to [[Pine Ridge Secondary School]] just off [[Finch Avenue]] in north Pickering.

==History==
===Foundation===
In 1924, an advert was placed in a newspaper for the start of a lay [[Ignatian spirituality]] retreat. This was followed by a retreat in early September 1925 by thirteen men at [[St. Augustine's Seminary]] in Toronto. The organizer was [[Frank Patrick O'Connor|Senator Frank O'Connor]] and Fr. John M. Filion SJ and Fr. Joseph Fallon SJ were the directors. This was followed by others retreats at the seminary, at [[Martyrs' Shrine]] in [[Midland, Ontario|Midland]] and at [[Regis College, Toronto|Regis College]] when it was on Wellington Street.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.manresa-canada.ca/about/history.shtml History] from Manresa Canada, retrieved 1 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, one wing of Regis College was converted so that retreats could be held also during the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regiscollege.ca/regis/history History] from [[Regis College, Toronto]] retrieved 1 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Sodality of Our Lady of the Way (which became the [[Christian Life Community]]) went on retreats at the college.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

By 1945, Fr. James Fleming SJ became the director and with the number of retreatants growing decided to establish a permanent centre. A building was bought in [[Erindale, Mississauga]]. It was named the Manresa Retreat House Centre, after [[Manresa]] in Spain, where the founder of the Jesuits, [[Ignatius of Loyola]] stayed in solitude for a year. It opened in November 1946 and had accommodation for eighteen retreatants.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

As soon as it opened, demand for retreats was more numerous that the centre could accommodate. Three years later the final retreat was held at Erindale. Manresa in Pickering opened its doors several days later with nineteen men on a retreat directed by Fr. Joe Clarke SJ. As there was no fixed fee, each retreatant making an offering according to his/her means. In 1990, a development committee was formed to raise funds. Over the next decade major improvements were made at the Manor House and the Retreat House parts of the centre as well as a new St. Ignatius Chapel and prayer centre were built.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

===Property===
The property of the retreat centre was previously called Clarendon Wood. In 1912 it was purchased by Lord Hyde, [[George Villiers, 6th Earl of Clarendon|George Villiers]], and Lord Somers, [[Arthur Somers-Cocks, 6th Baron Somers|Arthur Somers-Cocks]], to be a home for the two families.&lt;ref name=CW&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.builtheritagenews.ca/show_news.cfm?id=884&amp;t=3#.VXsltRNVikr|title = Clarendon Wood Pickering: Architect Unknown A Royal Whodunit|last = Russell|first = Victor|date = 14 April 2015|journal = Built Heritage News|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 June 2015|publisher = Catherine Nasmith Architect|issue = 239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The place was originally a 100-acre farm. Lord Hyde built a large house, known as the Manor House, within the property in summer of 1912. During the construction, the lords gave a tour of the property to the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], the third son of Queen Victoria, and his family.&lt;ref name=CW/&gt;

Both families remained there until the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1914, George Villiers became the sixth [[Earl of Clarendon]]. In 1931, he would become the [[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa]]. Lord Somers fought at [[Ypres]] in the war and in 1926 became the [[Governor of Victoria]].&lt;ref name=CW/&gt;

The house remained unoccupied until 1922 when it was sold to a business man, Victor Ross, a vice-president of [[Imperial Oil]]. He had the house and garden mended. In 1948, the house was sold to the Jesuits.&lt;ref name=CW/&gt;

==Overview==
The centre is located in north Pickering beside other Jesuit centres such as the La Storta community house and the Rene Goupil House retirement community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.jesuits.ca/index.cfm/2014/1/13/Rene-Goupil-House Rene Goupil House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407064642/http://blog.jesuits.ca/index.cfm/2014/1/13/Rene-Goupil-House |date=2014-04-07 }} retrieved 1 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It has numerous buildings such as the Retreat House where the accommodation is located and the Manor House where meals are prepared. The centre hosts retreats based on the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manresa-canada.ca/ Manresa-Canada.ca] retrieved 1 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Marsilius of Inghen''' (c. 1340 – August 20, 1396) was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] who studied with [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]] and [[Nicole Oresme]] under [[Jean Buridan]]. He was [[Magister (degree)|Magister]] at the [[University of Paris]] as well as at the [[University of Heidelberg]] from 1386 to 1396.

==Life==
He was born near [[Nijmegen]]. Details about his family and early life are not well known, the first known date of his biography being September 27, 1362. On that day he gave his [[Master's degree|Magister Artium]] lecture at the University of Paris. There, he received his masters of arts, then took up work and was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] in 1367 and 1371. Aside from his philosophical and logical studies, he also studied [[theology]], in which subject his lectures enjoyed large popularity. In 1378, Marsilius was the delegate of University of Paris for the Pope [[Urban VI]] in [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]].

After 1379 the name of Marsilius of Inghen was not mentioned anymore in the recordings of the University of Paris. He was probably driven out of the university because of a [[schism (religion)|schism]]. In 1383 Marsilius and Albert of Saxony went to spread the nominalist doctrine at {{Where|date=July 2011}}. In 1386, Marsiluis became the first rector of the University of Heidelberg, which he founded with the help of [[Rupert I, Elector Palatine]]. He was, furthermore, the first theologian to receive a doctorate from the university.

In 1386 Marsilius became Magister at the University of Heidelberg, of which he was rector nine times altogether: From 1386, the year of the foundation of the university, to 1392 and still from June 23 up to his death. From 1389 to 1390 he was responsible for transferring the university register to [[Rome]]. Afterwards he took up again the study of theology. Deceased just months later, Marsilius of Inghen was buried in the Church of Peter (Heidelberger Peterskirche) at [[Heidelberg]].

==Philosophy==

===Overview===
In [[logic]], he was an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[nominalism|nominalist]]; in [[natural philosophy]], an [[Empiricism|empiricist]]. He applied a synthesis of the new 14th century [[physics]] of Buridan, [[Thomas Bradwardine]] and Oresme in his commentaries on [[Aristotle]]. Both his [[theology|theological]] and philosophical works are characterized by a logico-[[semantics|semantical]] approach in which he followed Buridan, combined with an eclectic use of older theories, sometimes more Aristotelian and sometimes more [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]]; this fact that renders narrow the label "[[William of Ockham|Ockhamist]]" often applied to Marsilius.

===Nominalism===
Marsilius of Inghen is most well known for his work in nominalism. Though no one called themselves nominalists in the 14th century, he is considered one of the movement's "forefathers." In his nominalist philosophy he accepted the basic nominalist foundation, namely that universals are only existent within the mind, and outside the mind there are only individuals. He advocated that human knowledge can be derived from a foundation of sensory knowledge. However, to Marsilius, metaphysical knowledge was the greatest obtainable form of knowledge. This is due to its ability to grasp the most highly universal propositions.

===The object of scientific knowledge===
From his beliefs in nominalism in conjunction with his Aristotelian influences follows his reasoning on the object of scientific knowledge. Marsilius claims such an object must be singular and conform to Aristotle’s requirement that such an object must be a necessary universal. Therefore, given Marsilius’ acceptance of the basic nominalist foundation—that is, universals are only in the mind—objects of science are predicates which exist in the mind and describe the individuals in the world outside of the mind.

===Natural philosophy===
As already mentioned, he accepted that knowledge is made evident via sensory knowledge, i.e. he was an empiricist. However, he also accepted a priori truths to be an acceptable source of scientific knowledge. Also noteworthy is Marsilius’ theory behind impetus. Following in the footsteps of Buridan, Marsilius rejected the Aristotelian theory and claimed that such forces are the transfer of some property from that which did the affecting into the affected object.

In his ''Questions on the Eight Books of the Physics'', Marsilius cites ancient experiments with the [[Water thief|clepsydra]] as proof that "nature abhors a vacuum."

==Theology==
Marsilius began studies of theology at the University of Paris in 1366, though, the majority of his theological study took place during his time at the University of Heidelberg. His overall theological philosophy was influenced by Adam Wodeham, Gregory of Rimini, Thomas Aquinas, and Bonaventure. However, he does not wholly follow their thinking and holds original ideas in the subject.

In considering the creation of the world by God Marsilius held that God did not create the world as eternal, and that such means of creation was not contrary to God’s perfection. Concerning Marsilius’ other specific theological thought, he believed his natural philosophy lead to both some true knowledge of God, as well as an impediment towards complete true knowledge of God. Human’s natural capacities, according to Marsilius, are sufficient to derive the truth of proposition asserting God’s existence, God having a will, and God having knowledge. Natural capacities, although achieving that much, are unable to reach the truth of propositions asserting God’s omnipotence, God’s free will, and God’s ability to create ex nihilo. Hence, Marsilius thought that using nothing but one’s natural capacities in trying to find true knowledge of God will actually lead to the negation of God’s omnipotence, free will, and ability to create ex nihilo. Not only this, but use of logic in general regarding theological study was something Marsilius didn’t wholly accept. In order for one to reach such knowledge of God one must use Christian faith. This faith is the only means to reach the knowledge of God which natural capacities cannot obtain. In this sense, Marsilius advocated that natural human knowledge is such that it is limited in its capability to comprehend the divine, but still aides the search for such knowledge.

Also crucial to his theological studies are his thoughts regarding a version of divine simplicity—of which he was highly influenced by Wodeham. Even though human knowledge seems to abstract various properties or parts of God, such extrapolations are merely existent in human conceptions of God. God truly has only one essence and is one singular unity according to Marsilius.

==Influence==
Following Marsilius’ death, his works became rather well known. Marsilius was revered as one of the greatest nominalists of his time, alongside Ockham and Buridan. His extensive questions and commentaries on Aristotle (including commentaries on De Generatione et Corruptione, De Anima, Metaphysics, Physics, and Ethics) became textbooks for students throughout various universities. Moreover, his theology became widely read and influential in Spanish theology. He was influential on [[Central Europe]]an philosophy of later centuries, both through his own philosophy and by the way he stimulated reform of [[university]] programmes. In the 16th century there were still references to a "Marsilian way" in logic and physics.

:''See [[Diodorus Cronus]] for the classical Master Argument related to the [[problem of future contingents]].''

The '''master argument''' is [[George Berkeley]]'s [[argument]] that mind-independent objects do not exist because it is impossible to conceive of them.&lt;ref&gt;George Berkeley, ''A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge'', §22 to §23.&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is against intuition and has been widely challenged. The term "Berkeley's master argument" was introduced by Andre Gallois in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Gallois, Andre. "Berkeley's Master Argument." Philosophical Review 83 (1974): 55-69.&lt;/ref&gt; His term has firmly become currency of contemporary Berkeley scholarship.

==Overview==
In order to determine whether it is possible for a tree to exist outside of the mind, we need to be able to think of an unconceived tree.  But as soon as we try to think about this tree, we have conceived it. So we have failed and there is no good reason to believe that trees exist outside of the mind.

The Master Argument has been seen by several prominent philosophers as having a crucial mistake; see [[Idealism#Criticism|criticisms of idealism]]. However, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact mistake Berkeley makes. [[Bertrand Russell]] among others believed the problem is Berkeley fails to differentiate between the act of perception and the content of it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If we say that the things known must be in the mind, we are either un-duly limiting the mind's power of knowing, or we are uttering a mere [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]. We are uttering a mere tautology if we mean by 'in the mind' the same as by 'before the mind', i.e. if we mean merely being apprehended by the mind.  But if we mean this, we shall have to admit that what, in this sense, is in the mind, may nevertheless be not mental. Thus when we realize the nature of knowledge, Berkeley's argument is seen to be wrong in substance as well as in form, and his grounds for supposing that 'idea'-i.e. the objects apprehended-must be mental, are found to have no validity whatever.  Hence his grounds in favour of the idealism may be dismissed." &lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''The Problems of Philosophy'', pages 22 to 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Some claim that Berkeley was not making a Master Argument at all and that what he was actually trying to show was that the substance 'matter' was actually an abstract concept that passed itself off in peoples' minds as an object of immediate experience. Rather than say that the matter cannot exist, the critics claim, Berkeley is saying that it can only exist as an abstract concept and that this abstract concept was conceptually useless.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Pilkington, [http://fixingtheeconomists.wordpress.com/2014/01/03/berkeleys-master-argument-doesnt-exist/ ''Berkeley's 'Master Argument' Doesn't Exist'', Fixing the Economists].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''May Devotions to the Blessed Virgin Mary''' refers to special [[Marian devotions]] held in the [[Catholic Church]] during the month of May honoring the Virgin Mary as "the Queen of May". These services may take place inside or outside. A "May Crowning" is a traditional Roman Catholic ritual that occurs in the month of May.
==Origins==
A number of traditions link the month of May to Mary. [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso]] in the 13th century wrote in his ''[[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]'' about the special honoring of Mary during specific dates in May. Eventually, the entire month was filled with special observances and devotions to Mary.

The origin of the conventional May devotion is still relatively unknown. Herbert Thurston identifies the seventeenth century as the earliest instance of the adoption of the custom of consecrating the month of May to the Blessed Virgin by special observances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15459a.htm Thurston, Herbert. "Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 1 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; It is certain that this form of Marian devotion began in Italy. Around 1739, witnesses speak of a particular form of Marian devotion in May in Grezzano near [[Verona]]. In 1747 the Archbishop of Genoa recommended the May devotion as a devotion for the home.&lt;ref name=kuppers&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/questions/yq2/yq367.html Küppers, Kurt. ''Marienlexikon'', Vol 4, p. 244-246, Augsburg]&lt;/ref&gt; Specific prayers for them were promulgated in Rome in 1838. &lt;ref&gt;''Maiden and Mother: Prayers, Hymns, Devotions'' by Margaret Miles 2001 {{ISBN|0-86012-305-7}} page 87&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Frederick Holweck, the May devotion in its present form originated at Rome where Father Latomia of the Roman College of the [[Society of Jesus]], to counteract infidelity and immorality among the students, made a vow at the end of the eighteenth century to devote the month of May to Mary. From Rome the practice spread to the other Jesuit colleges and thence to nearly every Catholic church of the Latin rite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10542a.htm Holweck, Frederick. "Special Devotions for Months." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 1 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome by 1813, May devotions were held in as many as twenty churches. From Italy, May devotions soon spread to France. In Belgium, the May devotions, at least as a private devotion, were already known by 1803. The tradition of honoring Mary in a month-long May devotion spread eventually around the Roman Catholic world in the 19th century together with a month-long devotion to [[Jesus]] in June and the [[Rosary]] in October.

==May devotions==
In his 1965 [[encyclical]], ''Mense Maio'', [[Pope Paul VI]] identified the month of May as an opportune time to incorporate special prayers for peace into traditional May devotions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_29041965_mense-maio_en.html Pope Paul VI, ''Mense Maio'', Encyclical Of Pope Paul VI On Prayers During May For Preservation Of Peace, April 29, 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BanholtLourdesgrotroazekranswkped08.jpg|thumb|250px|Marian devotion of Rosary]]

There is no firm structure as to the content of a May devotion. It usually includes the singing of Marian anthems, readings from scriptures, and a [[sermon]]. Although prayers likely include the recitation of the [[Hail Mary]], the [[rosary]] itself is not usually a part of this particular devotion. Catholics offer Mary in May: pilgrimages, visits to churches dedicated to her, little sacrifices in her honor, periods of study and well-finished work offered up to her, and a more attentive recitation of the [[rosary]].&lt;ref name=cna&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/prayers/devotions/to-the-blessed-virgin-mary/month-of-mary-may-devotions/ "Month of Mary-May Devotions", Catholic News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The last devotion on May 31 is often followed by a solemn procession, during which a statue or portrait of the Virgin Mary is carried back into the church. Some May devotions may take place outside in a forest or a dedicated special place.

===Family Devotions===
One particular practice characteristic of May devotions is the May Altar, whether in a church or as a "[[house altar]]" in the home. Marian devotions such as the rosary may take place within the family around this altar consisting of a table with a Marian picture, candles, and decorated with many May flowers The custom of the May Altar stems from southern European countries. With the development of May Altars in churches, the custom spread to set up this type of "altar" also in the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/questions/yq2/yq369.html  Küppers, p. 243-244]&lt;/ref&gt;

This specific devotion has been supported be several popes including [[Pope Pius XII]] in his encyclical ''[[Ingruentium malorum]]'':

*  ''The custom of the family recitation of the Holy Rosary is a most efficacious means. What a sweet sight - most pleasing to God - when, at eventide, the Christian home resounds with the frequent repetition of praises in honor of the High  Queen of Heaven! Then the Rosary, recited in the family, assembled before the image of the Virgin, in an admirable union of hearts, the parents and their children, who come back from their daily work. It unites them piously with those absent and those dead. It links all more tightly in a sweet bond of love, with the most Holy Virgin, who, like a loving mother, in the circle of her children, will be there bestowing upon them an abundance of the gifts of concord and family peace.'' &lt;ref&gt;''Ingruentium malorum'', 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mary, Queen of May ==
[[Pope Pius XII]], recognizing traditional precedents, proclaimed the "Queenship of Mary" through his encyclical, ''Ad Caeli Reginam''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_11101954_ad-caeli-reginam_en.html Pope Pius XII, ''Ad Caeli Reginam'', Encyclical Of Pope Pius XII On Proclaiming The Queenship Of Mary]&lt;/ref&gt;

While May devotions may differ in various countries, the Marian title "Queen of May" exists in several countries as manifested in Marian songs. In English speaking countries such as England, Ireland and the United States a Marian hymn uses the following text:  
{{quote|Hail Virgin, dearest Mary! Our lovely Queen of May! O spotless, blessed Lady, Our lovely Queen of May. Your children, humbly bending, Surround your shrine ..''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chantcd.com/lyrics/hail_virgin_dearest.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}} In German-speaking countries, the equivalent term is ''Maienkönigin'' ("May-Queen"): 
{{quote|''Maria Maienkönigin,. wir kommen dich zu grüßen. O holde Freudenspenderin,. sieh uns zu deinen Füßen.''&lt;br&gt;(Mary, Queen of May,  we come to greet you. You see us at your feet.)&lt;ref&gt;clamu.dyndns.org/klassik/Kirchenlieder/Maria_Maienkonigin.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another similar song greets Mary, the queen of May, who is greeted by the month of May.&lt;ref&gt;"Maria, Maienkönigin, dich will der Mai begrüßen. O segne ihn mit holdem Sinn  ..." kirchensite.de/?myELEMENT=112087 - 23k&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-known Marian "Queen of May" song ends with the words:
* ''O Mary we crown thee with blossoms today!''
* ''Queen of the Angels and Queen of the May.''
* ''O Mary we crown thee with blossoms today,''
* ''Queen of the Angels and Queen of the May''.&lt;ref&gt;campus.udayton.edu/mary//resources/mayhymns.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===May crownings===
In [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern churches]], crowning Mary was associated with adding ornamentation to an [[icon]] of Mary, sometimes as simple as adding additional gold trim. Perhaps in homage to this, [[Pope]] [[Clement VIII]] added two crowns to the icon of [[Salus Populi Romani]] in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Saint Mary Major Basilica]] in Rome. The crowns were eventually lost, but were replaced by [[Gregory XVI]] in 1837 in a rite that was to become the standard practice for crowning.

“Images are venerated ‘not because of a belief that these images themselves possess anything of divinity or power, but because the honor shown them is directed to the prototypes they represent’ (Council of Trent, session 25)” [BB, no. 1258].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dio.org/uploads/files/Worship/May_Crowning_of_BVM_Intro.pdf "May Crowning Images of the Blessed Virgin Mary", Diocese of Springfield, Illinois]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parishes and private groups often process and crown an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary with flowers. This often is referred to as a “May Crowning.” This rite may be done on solemnities and feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or other festive days, and offers the Church a chance to reflect on Mary’s role in the history of salvation.&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;[http://www.pastoralliturgy.org/resources/0703CrowningImageOfBVM.php Lewis, Suzaanne M. "Crowning an Image of the Blessed Virgin Mary", ''Pastoral Liturgy'']&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, it takes place on or about May 1, however, in many United States Catholic parishes, it frequently takes place on Mother's Day.

The custom fell out of vogue in many places during the 1970s-80s, but has since made a comeback along with many other traditional Catholic practices.&lt;ref name=mcnamara/&gt; An image or likeness of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] is ceremonially crowned to signify her as [[Queen of Heaven]] and the [[Mother of God]].

Today, May crownings occur in many Roman Catholic parishes and homes with the crowning of a statue of Mary. There is considerable flexibility regarding the rite, and it can be adapted to many different circumstances and situations depending on whether the crowning is done in a parish, a school or classroom, or even in the family. The rite may consist of hymns, prayers, and perhaps an act of consecration to Our Lady.&lt;ref name=mcnamara&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/may-crownings-of-maryMcNamara, Edward. "May Crownings of Mary", ''Zenit'', May 6, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The climax of the celebration is the moment when the one of those present places a crown of flowers on Mary's head accompanied by a traditional hymn to the Blessed Mother.&lt;ref name=mcnamara/&gt; The ceremony usually takes place with young girls in dresses carrying flowers (traditionally [[Crataegus|hawthorn]]) to adorn the statue. One of the girls (often the youngest) carries a crown of flowers or an actual golden crown on a cushion for placement by the [[May Queen]] (often the oldest girl) on the statue. The flowers are replaced throughout the month to keep them fresh.

The [[Coronation of the Virgin]] became a popular subject in art.

==''Flores de Mayo''==
{{Main|Flores de Mayo}}

In the [[Philippines]] and other countries, Mary is fêted in May with the ''Flores de Mayo'' ("Flowers of May"), where devotees collect colourful flowers with which to decorate the [[parish]] church's altars and aisles.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.2camels.com/flowers-of-may.php Bayan, Ruby."Flowers of May"]&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic communities often congregate in the afternoons to pray the rosary, offer flowers to an image of the Virgin Mary, and share homemade delicacies and snacks. In more formal processions, children and adults wear their [[wikt:Sunday best|Sunday best]], singing and dancing to welcome the rains that will water the new crops.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

The celebration is highlighted by the ''[[Santacruzan]]'',  a ritual pageant celebrating the [[Finding of the Holy Cross]]. Young ladies, often called ''reynas'' ("queens"), are chosen to represent biblical figures such as [[Book of Judith|Judith]], [[Titles of Mary|Marian titles]] taken from the [[Litany of Loreto]] (e.g. ''[[Rosa Mystica|Rosa Mística]]''), and other traditional or allegorical figures from religious and national history (e.g. ''Reyna Emperatríz'', ''Reyna Mora''). The ''reynas'', dressed in their finery and bearing attributes, walk through the town escorted by young men or boys. The ''Reyna Elena'', representing [[Helena (empress)|Saint Helena]], is the last and grandest; she bears a cross or crucifix as she is escorted by a young boy playing [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. All participants walk under mobile arches festooned with flowers or other decorations connoting bounty.

The ''Santacruzan'' custom in the Philippines is thus a fusion of both the May Marian devotions and celebrations surrounding [[Roodmas]], which was once celebrated on 3 May.

==Mary Gardens==
{{Main|Mary garden}}
Floral imagery from scripture and nature has been applied to Mary in the writings of the Church Fathers and in the liturgy, providing the foundation in tradition for the subsequent naming of hundreds of flowers for Mary's life, mysteries, virtues, excellences and divine prerogatives in the popular religious folk traditions of the medieval countrysides - as recorded by botanists, folklorists and lexicographers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/m_garden/marygardensmain.html Stokes, Jr., John. "Mary's Gardens"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of honoring Mary with flowers originated among monasteries and convents in [[medieval Europe]]. During the Middle Ages, people saw reminders of Mary in the flowers and herbs growing around them.&lt;ref name=krymow&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/messenger/may2000/feature2.asp Krymow, Vincenzina and Frisk, M. Jean. "Honoring Mary in Your Garden", ''St. Anthony Messenger''] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050503012019/https%3A//www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/May2000/feature2.asp |date=2005-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first reference to an actual garden dedicated to Mary is from the life of St. [[Saint Fiacre|Fiacre]], Irish patron saint of gardening, who planted and tended a garden around the oratory to Our Lady he built at his famous hospice for the poor and infirm in France in the 7th Century.

[[image:Nakae Toju portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Nakae Tōju]]
{{nihongo|'''Nakae Tōju'''|中江 藤樹||21 April 1608 – 11 October 1648}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] known as "the sage of [[Ōmi Province|Ōmi]]".

Nakae was a [[Feudalism|feudal]] retainer who lived during the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].  He taught that the highest virtue was [[filial piety]] (''kō''), and acted upon this, giving up his official post in 1634 in order to return to his home in [[Takashima District, Shiga|Takashima]], Ōmi to care of his mother.  He distinguished, however, between ''sho-kō'' and ''dai-kō'': lesser and greater filial piety.  ''Sho-kō'' involves the normal care owed by children to their parents; ''dai-kō'' involves the notion that our human parents are themselves the children of the divine parents &amp;mdash; thus, if one's parents are wrong, then one should encourage them to return to virtue.

He was unusual in believing that his teaching would be useful to women as well as men.  While accepting the then standard view of women as usually lacking such virtues as compassion and honesty, he argued: "if a wife's disposition is healthy and pious, obedient, sympathetic and honest, then&amp;nbsp;... every member of her family will be at peace and the entire household in perfect order."&lt;ref&gt;Bodart-Bailey, Beatrice. (1997). "Confucianism in Japan" in  ''Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy,'' p. 743 ''citing'' De Bary, William. (1981). ''Neo-Confucian Orthodoxy and the Learning of the Mind-and-Heart,'' p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nakae originally followed the teachings of the [[China|Chinese]] [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucian]] philosopher [[Zhu Xi]], but eventually became more influenced by [[Wang Yangming]] (1472–1529), who argued for the primacy of human intuition or conscience over intellect: moral improvement arises out of conscience-based action (compare [[Aristotle's ethics]]).  Nakae added a more religious aspect to Wang's "School of Intuition of Mind", calling the human conscience the "divine light of heaven".  Nakae's works also supplied his followers (such as [[Kumazawa Banzan]] [1619–1691]) with "the moral foundation for political action".&lt;ref&gt;Bodart-Bailey, p. 741.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gnosticism}}
[[Gnosticism]] refers to a collection of religious groups originating in Jewish religiosity in Alexandria in the first few centuries CE.&lt;ref name = "Filoramo"&gt;[[Giovanni Filoramo|Filoramo, Giovanni]] (1990). ''A History of Gnosticism''. Blackwell. pp. 142-7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neoplatonism]] was a school of [[Hellenistic philosophy]] that took shape in the 3rd century, based on the teachings of [[Plato]] and some of his early [[Platonism|followers]]. While Gnosticism was influenced by [[Middle Platonism]], neo-Platonists from the third century onward rejected Gnosticism.

==Gnosticism==
Gnosticism originated in the late first century CE in nonrabbinical Jewish sects and early Christian sects,{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515-3516}}&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; and many of the Nag Hammadi texts make reference to Judaism, in some cases with a violent rejection of the Jewish God.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;''20th Century Jewish Religious Thought'' Arthur A. Cohen, Paul Mendes-Flohr, Arthur Allen Cohen 1988 republished 2010, page 286&lt;/ref&gt;

Sethianism may have started as a pre-Christian tradition, possibly a [[syncretic]] Hebrew&lt;ref&gt;Carl B. Smith (2004), ''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1565639448 No Longer Jews: The Search for Gnostic Origins]''&lt;/ref&gt; Mediterranean baptismal movement from the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], with [[Babylonia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] pagan elements{{fact|date=April 2018}}, and elements from [[Greek philosophy|Hellenic philosophy]]. Both [[Sethian]] Gnostics and the [[Valentinius|Valentinian]] Gnostics incorporated elements of Christianity and Hellenic philosophy as it grew, including elements from [[Plato]], [[Middle Platonism]] and [[Neo-Pythagoreanism]].&lt;ref name = "Turner1"&gt;Turner, John. "Sethian Gnosticism: A Literary History" in Nag Hammadi, Gnosticism and Early Christianity, 1986 p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier Sethian texts such as [[Apocalypse of Adam]] show signs of being pre-Christian and focus on the [[Seth]] of the Jewish bible.{{refn|group=note|Not the Egyptian God [[Set (mythology)|Set]] who is sometimes called Seth in Greek.}} Later Sethian texts are continuing to interact with Platonism, and texts such as [[Zostrianos]] and [[Allogenes]] draw on the imagery of older Sethian texts, but utilize "a large fund of philosophical conceptuality derived from contemporary Platonism, (that is late middle Platonism) with no traces of Christian content."&lt;ref name = "Turner1"/&gt;

Scholarship on Gnosticism has been greatly advanced by the discovery and translation of the [[Nag Hammadi]] texts, which shed light on some of the more puzzling comments by [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] regarding the Gnostics. It now seems clear that "[[Sethian]]" and "[[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinian]]" gnostics attempted "an effort towards conciliation, even affiliation" with late antique philosophy.&lt;ref name="Schenke1"&gt;Schenke, Hans Martin. "The Phenomenon and Significance of Gnostic Sethianism" in The Rediscovery of Gnosticism. E. J. Brill 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platonism==
By the third century [[Plotinus]] had shifted [[Plato]]nist thought far enough that modern scholars consider the period a new movement called "[[Neoplatonism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Harder, ''Scrift Plotins''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical relations==
Gnostics borrow a lot of ideas and terms from Platonism.  They exhibit a keen understanding of Greek philosophical terms and the Greek [[Koine]] language in general, and use Greek philosophical concepts throughout their text, including such concepts as [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] (reality, existence), [[ousia]] (essence, substance, being), and [[demiurge]] (creator God). Good examples include texts such as the Hypostasis of the Archons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/Hypostas-Barnstone.html|title=The Reality of the Rulers (Hypostasis of the Archons) - Barntone and Meyer - The Nag Hammadi Library|author=|date=|website=www.gnosis.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Reality of the Rulers) or [[Trimorphic Protennoia]] (The First Thought which is in Three forms).&lt;ref&gt;[[Trimorphic Protennoia]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}}

Gnostics structured their world of transcendent being by ontological distinctions. The plenitude of the divine world emerges from a sole high deity by emanation, radiation, unfolding and mental self-reflection. The technique of self-performable contemplative mystical ascent towards and beyond a realm of pure being, which is rooted in Plato's Symposium and was common in Gnostic thought, was also expressed by Plotinus.{{refn|group=note|See Life of Plotinus}}

Divine triads, tetrads, and ogdoads in Gnostic thought often are closely related to Neo-Pythagorean [[arithmology]]. The trinity of the "triple-powered one" (with the powers consisting of the modalities of existence, life and mind) in Allogenes mirrors quite closely the Neoplatonic doctrine of the Intellect differentiating itself from the One in three phases, called [[Existence]] or [[reality]] ([[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]), Life, and Intellect ([[nous]]). Both traditions heavily emphasize the role of negative theology or [[Negative theology|apophasis]], and Gnostic emphasis on the ineffability of God often echoes Platonic (and Neoplatonic) formulations of the ineffability of the One or the Good.

There were some important philosophical differences. Gnostics emphasized magic and ritual in a way that would have been disagreeable to the more sober Neoplatonists such as [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], though perhaps not to later Neoplatonists such as [[Iamblichus]]. Gnostics were in conflict with the idea expressed by Plotinus that the approach to the infinite force, which is the One or [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]], cannot be through knowing or not knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrB53l4wNK0C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=plotinus+energy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=rbnlnnwui5&amp;sig=84RfXY8ErxUowZm2xT21Nuk8_II#PPA6,M1 |title=Faith and philosophy By David G. Leahy |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enneads VI 9.6&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been dispute as to which gnostics Plotinus was referring to, it appears they were Sethian.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Armstrong (translator), Plotinus' ''Enneads'' in the tract named ''Against the Gnostics'': Footnote, p. 264 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Platonic objections==
In the third century CE both Christianity and neo-Platonism reject and turn against Gnosticism, with neo-Platonists as Plotinus, Porphyry and Amelius attacking the Sethians. [[John D. Turner]] believes that this double attack led to Sethianism fragmentation into numerous smaller groups ([[Audian]]s, [[Borborites]], [[Archontics]] and perhaps [[Phibionites]], [[Stratiotici]], and [[Borborites|Secundians]]).

Plotinus considered his Gnostic opponents "heretics", "[[imbecile]]s" and "[[blasphemy|blasphemers]]" erroneously arriving at [[misotheism]] as the solution to the [[problem of evil]], taking all their truths over from Plato. Plotinus' main objection to the Gnostic teachings he encountered was to their rejection of the goodness of the [[demiurge]] and of the material world. He attacked the Gnostics for their vilification of Plato's [[ontology]] of the universe as contained in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''. Plotinus accused Gnosticism of vilifying the demiurge or craftsman that shaped the material world, and so ultimately for perceiving the material world as evil, or as a prison. Plotinus set forth that the demiurge is the nous (as an emanation of the One), which is the ordering principle or mind, also reason. Plotinus was critical of the gnostic derivation of the Demiurge from Wisdom as [[Sophia (wisdom)|''Sophia'']], the [[Christian anthropology|anthropomorphic]] personification of wisdom as a feminine spirit deity not unlike the goddess [[Athena]] or the Christian [[Holy Spirit]]. These objections seem applicable to some of the Nag Hammadi texts, although others such as the Valentinians, or the Tripartite Tractate, appear to insist on the goodness of the world and the Demiurge.{{refn|group=note|Plotinus indicated that if gnostics really believed this world to be a prison, then they might at any moment free themselves from it by committing suicide.}}

==First International Conference==
The '''First International Conference on Neoplatonism and Gnosticism''' at the [[University of Oklahoma]] in 1984 explored the relationship between [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Gnosticism]]. The conference also led to a book named ''Neoplatonism and Gnosticism''.

The book's intent was to document the creation of a conference in the academic world exploring the relationship between late and middle Platonic philosophy and Gnosticism. The book marked a turning point in the discussion on the subject of Neoplatonism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|first=Richard T.|last=Wallis|page=2 |quote=Its study has, however been hindered until recently by lack of original Gnostics writings, the main exceptions being a few short texts quoted by the Church Fathers and some (mostly late) works translated from Greeks into Coptic, the native Egyptian language. Our picture has, however, been revolutionized by the discovery in late 1945 of a Coptic Gnostic library at Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt|year=1992|title=Neoplatonism and Gnosticism|publisher=New York Press|isbn=0-7914-1337-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it took into account the understanding of the gnostics of Plotinus' day in light of the discovery of the ''[[Nag Hammadi library]]''. Further discussions of the topics covered in the book led to the formation of a new committee of scholars to once again translate [[Plotinus]]' ''[[Enneads]]''. Both Richard Wallis and [[A.H. Armstrong]], the major editors of the work, have died since the completion of the book and conference.

This conference was held to cover some of the controversies surrounding these issues and other aspects of the two groups. The objective of the event (and the book that documents the event) was to clarify the relationship between Neoplatonism / Neoplatonists and the sectarian groups of the day, the Gnostics. The book republished the works of a wide spectrum of scholars in the field of [[philosophy]]. The book's content consisted of presentations that the experts delivered at the first International Conference. One purpose was to clarify the meaning of the words and phrases repeated in other [[religion]]s and belief systems of the [[Mediterranean]] region during Plotinus' time. Another was to try to clarify the extent to which Plotinus' work followed directly from [[Plato]], and how much influence Plotinus had on the religions of his time and vice versa. The conference and the book documenting it is considered a key avenue for dialogue among the different scholars in the [[history of philosophy]].

===Later conferences and studies===
John D. Turner of the University of Nebraska has led additional conferences covering topics and materials relating to Neoplatonism and Gnosticism. Presentations from seminars that took place between 1993 and 1998 are published in the book ''Gnosticism and Later Platonism: Themes, Figures, and Texts Symposium Series'' (Society of Biblical Literature)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rs/rak/courses/535/reviews/Turner-CP.htm|title=Carl Pfendner|author=|date=|website=ccat.sas.upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[metaphysics]], the '''noumenon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|uː|m|ə|n|ɒ|n}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|aʊ|-}}; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: νούμενον) is a posited object or event that exists independently of human [[sense]] and/or [[perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=1. intellectual conception of a thing as it is in itself, not as it is known through perception; 2. The of-itself-unknown and unknowable rational object, or thing-in-itself, which is distinguished from the phenomenon through which it is apprehended by the physical senses, and by which it is interpreted and understood;&amp;nbsp;– so used in the philosophy of Kant and his followers.|url=http://www.websters-dictionary-online.org/definitions/Noumenon|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928115535/http://www.websters-dictionary-online.org/definitions/Noumenon?cx=partner-pub-0939450753529744:v0qd01-tdlq&amp;cof=FORID:9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Noumenon&amp;sa=Search|archivedate=2011-09-28|deadurl=yes|title=Noumenon &amp;#124; Definition of Noumenon by Webster's Online Dictionary|accessdate=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''noumenon'' is generally used when contrasted with, or in relation to, the term ''[[Phenomena (philosophy)|phenomenon]]'', which refers to anything that can be apprehended by or is an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] of the senses. Modern philosophy has generally been skeptical of the possibility of knowledge independent of the senses, and [[Immanuel Kant]] gave this point of view its canonical expression: that the noumenal world may exist, but it is completely unknowable through human sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/noumenon|title=noumenon {{!}} philosophy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kantianism|Kantian philosophy]], the unknowable noumenon is often linked to the unknowable "[[thing-in-itself]]" (in Kant's German, ''Ding an sich''), although how to characterize the nature of the relationship is a question yet open to some controversy.

==Etymology==
The [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|νοούμενoν}} ''nooúmenon'' (plural {{lang|grc|νοούμενα}} ''nooúmena'') is the [[Ancient Greek grammar#Participles|neuter middle-passive present participle]] of {{lang|grc|νοεῖν}} ''noeîn'' "to think, to mean", which in turn originates from the word {{lang|grc|νοῦς}} ''[[nous|noûs]]'', an [[Attic Greek|Attic]] [[synaeresis|contracted]] form of [[wikt:νόος|νόος]] ''nóos''{{efn|Ontology}} "perception, understanding, mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|noe/w|νοεῖν}}, {{LSJ|nou{{=}}s|νοῦς}}, {{LSJ|no/os|νόος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|noumenon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rough equivalent in English would be "something that is thought", or "the object of an act of thought".

==Concept in pre-Kantian philosophy==
&lt;i&gt;The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/i&gt; writes "[[Platonic form|Platonic Ideas and Forms]] are noumenon{{efn|Observation}}, and phenomena are things displaying
themselves to the senses. [...] that noumena and the noumenal world are objects of the highest knowledge, truths, and values is Plato's principal legacy to philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |editorlink=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |url=https://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Companion-Philosophy-Ted-Honderich/dp/0198661320/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414514364&amp;sr=1-1#reader_0198661320 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=31 August 1995 |page=657 |isbn=0198661320 |accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that noumena and the noumenal world were objects of the highest knowledge, truths, and values, was disputed from the start, beginning with [[Democritus]], his follower [[Pyrrho]], founder of [[Pyrrhonism]], and even in the [[Academy]] starting with [[Arcesilaus]] and the introduction of [[Academic Skepticism]]. In these traditions of [[philosophical skepticism]], noumena are suspected of being delusions.  Plato's [[allegory of the cave]] may be interpreted as an illustration of the noumenal/phenomenal distinction.

==Kant's usage==

===Overview===
As expressed in Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]],'' human understanding is structured by "concepts of the understanding", or pure [[categories of understanding]] found prior to experience in the mind, and which make outer experiences possible as counterpart to the rational faculties of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert (2009). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-judgment/supplement2.html Completing the Picture of Kant's Metaphysics of Judgment]. ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/kant-metaphysics/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Kant's metaphysics].&lt;/ref&gt;

By Kant's account, when one employs a concept to describe or categorize ''noumena'' (the objects of inquiry, investigation or analysis of the workings of the world), one is employing a way of describing or categorizing ''phenomena'' (the observable manifestations of those objects of inquiry, investigation or analysis). Kant posited methods by which human understanding makes sense of and thus intuits phenomena that appear to the mind: the concepts of the ''[[transcendental aesthetic]]'', as well as that of the ''transcendental analytic'', ''[[transcendental logic]]'' and ''transcendental deduction''.&lt;ref name="EOP, K2"&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan, 1967, 1996) Volume 4, "Kant, Immanuel", section on "Critique of Pure Reason: Theme and Preliminaries", p. 308 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EOP, K3"&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan, 1967, 1996) Volume 4, "Kant, Immanuel", section on "Transcendental Aesthetic", p. 310 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EOP, K4"&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan, 1967, 1996) Volume 4, "Kant, Immanuel", section on "Pure Concepts of the Understanding", p. 311 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Taken together, Kant's "categories of understanding" are the principles of the human mind which necessarily are brought to bear in attempting to understand the world in which we [[Existence|exist]] (that is, to understand, or attempt to understand, "things in themselves").  In each instance the word "transcendental" refers to the process that the human mind must exercise to understand or grasp the form of, and order among, phenomena. Kant asserts that to "transcend" a direct observation or experience is to use reason and classifications to strive to correlate with the phenomena that are observed.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Humans can make sense out of phenomena in these various ways, but in doing so can never know the "things-in-themselves", the actual objects and dynamics of the natural world in their noumenal dimension - this being the negative correlate to phenomena and that which escapes the limits of human understanding. By Kant's Critique, our minds may attempt to correlate in useful ways, perhaps even closely accurate ways, with the structure and order of the various aspects of the universe, but cannot know these "things-in-themselves" (noumena) directly. Rather, we must infer the extent to which the human rational faculties can reach the object of "things-in-themselves" by our observations of the manifestations of those things that can be perceived via the physical senses, that is, of phenomena, and by ordering these perceptions in the mind infer the validity of our perceptions to the rational categories used to understand them in a rational system, this rational system (''transcendental analytic''), being the categories of the understanding as free from empirical contingency.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan, 1967, 1996) Volume 4, "Kant, Immanuel", section on "Critique of Pure Reason: Theme and Preliminaries", p. 308 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also, e.g., ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan, 1967, 1996) Volume 4, "Kant, Immanuel", section on "Pure Concepts of the Understanding", p. 311 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kant, objects of which we are cognizant via the physical senses are merely representations of ''unknown somethings''—what Kant refers to as the ''transcendental object''—as interpreted through the ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or ''categories of the understanding''. These ''unknown somethings'' are manifested within the noumenon—although we can never know how or why as our perceptions of these ''unknown somethings'' via our physical senses are bound by the limitations of the ''categories of the understanding'' and we are therefore never able to fully know the "thing-in-itself".{{sfn|Kant|1999|loc=A256/B312|p=27}}

===Noumenon and the thing-in-itself===

Many accounts of Kant's philosophy treat "noumenon" and "thing-in-itself" as synonymous, and there is textual evidence for this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant (1781) ''Critique of Pure Reason,'' for example in A254/B310, p. 362 (Guyer and Wood), "The concept of a '''noumenon''', i.e., of a thing that is not to be thought of as an object of the senses but rather as a thing-in-itself [...]"; But note that the terms are not used interchangeably throughout. The first reference to ''thing-in-itself'' comes many pages (A30) before the first reference to '''noumenon''' (A250). For a secondary or tertiary source, see: [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056357/noumenon "Noumenon"] in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stephen Palmquist holds that "noumenon" and "thing-in-itself" are only ''loosely'' synonymous, inasmuch as they represent the same concept viewed from two different perspectives,&lt;ref&gt;"Noumenon: the name given to a thing when it is viewed as a transcendent object. The term 'negative noumenon' refers only to the recognition of something which is not an object of sensible intuition, while 'positive noumenon' refers to the (quite mistaken) attempt to know such a thing as an empirical object. These two terms are sometimes used loosely as synonyms for 'transcendental object' and 'thing-in-itself', respectively. (Cf. phenomenon.)"&amp;nbsp;– [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1/KSPglos.html Glossary of Kant's Technical Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thing-in-itself: an object considered transcendentally apart from all the conditions under which a subject can gain knowledge of it via the physical senses. Hence the thing-in-itself is, by definition, unknowable via the physical senses. Sometimes used loosely as a synonym of noumenon. (Cf. appearance.)"&amp;nbsp;– [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1/KSPglos.html Glossary of Kant's Technical Terms]. Palmquist defends his definitions of these terms in his article, "Six Perspectives on the Object in Kant's Theory of Knowledge", ''Dialectica'' 40:2 (1986), pp.121–151; revised and reprinted as Chapter VI in Palmquist's book, ''Kant's System of Perspectives'' (Lanham: University Press of America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; and other scholars also argue that they are not identical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Teodor Oizerman|Oizerman, T. I.]], "Kant's Doctrine of the "Things in Themselves" and Noumena", Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. 41, No. 3, Mar., 1981, 333–350; Karin de Boer, "Kant's Multi-Layered Conception of Things in Themselves, Transcendental Objects, and Monads", Kant-Studien 105/2, 2014, 221-260.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Schopenhauer's criticism of Kantian philosophy|Schopenhauer criticised Kant]] for changing the meaning of "noumenon". Opinion is far from unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;"Other interpreters have introduced an almost unending stream of varying suggestions as to how these terms ought to be used. A handful of examples will be sufficient to make this point clear, without any claim to represent an exhaustive overview. Perhaps the most commonly accepted view is expressed by Paulsen, who equates 'thing-in-itself' and 'noumenon', equates 'appearance' and 'phenomenon', distinguishes 'positive noumenon' and 'negative noumenon', and treats 'negative noumenon' as equivalent to 'transcendental object' [pp. 4:148-50, 154-5, 192]. Al-Azm and Wolff also seem satisfied to equate 'phenomenon' and 'appearance', though they both carefully distinguish 'thing-in-itself' from 'negative noumenon' and 'positive noumenon' [A4:520; W21:165, 313–5; s.a. W9:162]. Gotterbarn similarly equates the former pair, as well as 'thing-in-itself' and 'positive noumenon', but distinguishes between 'transcendental object', 'negative noumenon' and 'thing-in-itself' [G11: 201]. By contrast, Bird and George both distinguish between 'appearance' and 'phenomenon', but not between 'thing-in-itself' and 'noumenon' [B20:18,19, 53–7; G7:513-4n]; and Bird sometimes blurs the distinction between 'thing-in-itself' and 'transcendental object' as well.[2] Gram equates 'thing-in-itself' not with 'noumenon', but with 'phenomenon' [G13:1,5-6]! Allison cites different official meanings for each term, yet he tends to equate 'thing-in-itself' at times with 'negative noumenon' and at times with 'transcendental-object', usually ignoring the role of the 'positive noumenon' [A7:94; A10:58,69]. And Buchdahl responds to the fact that the thing-in-itself seems to be connected with each of the other object-terms by regarding it as 'Kant's umbrella term'.[3]" [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1/KSP6A.html Stephen Palmquist on Kant's object terms]&lt;/ref&gt;  Kant's writings show points of difference between noumena and things-in-themselves. For instance, he regards things-in-themselves as existing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...though we cannot know these objects as things in themselves, we must yet be in a position at least to think them as things in themselves; otherwise we should be landed in the absurd conclusion that there can be appearance without anything that appears.{{sfn|Kant|1999|loc=Bxxvi-xxvii}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He is much more doubtful about noumena:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But in that case a noumenon is not for our understanding a special [kind of] object, namely, an intelligible object; the [sort of] understanding to which it might belong is itself a problem. For we cannot in the least represent to ourselves the possibility of an understanding which should know its object, not discursively through categories, but intuitively in a non-sensible intuition.{{sfn|Kant|1999|loc=A256, B312|p=273}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A crucial difference between the noumenon and the thing-in-itself is that to call something a noumenon is to claim a kind of knowledge, whereas Kant insisted that the thing-in-itself is unknowable. Interpreters have debated whether the latter claim makes sense: it seems to imply that we know at least one thing about the thing-in-itself (i.e., that it is unknowable). But Stephen Palmquist explains that this is part of Kant's definition of the term, to the extent that anyone who claims to have found a way of making the thing-in-itself knowable must be adopting a non-Kantian position.&lt;ref&gt;"The Radical Unknowability of Kant's 'Thing in Itself'", Cogito 3:2 (March 1985), pp.101–115; revised and reprinted as Appendix V in Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1 Kant's System of Perspectives] (Lanham: University Press of America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive and negative noumena===
Kant also makes a distinction between ''positive'' and ''negative'' noumena:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hume.ucdavis.edu/mattey/phi175/phenomlec.html Mattey, G. J.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-philosophy.ucdavis.edu/mattey/kant/APPEAR.HTM Lecture notes by G. J. Mattey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612165634/http://www-philosophy.ucdavis.edu/mattey/kant/APPEAR.HTM |date=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If by 'noumenon' we mean a thing so far as it is not an object of our sensible intuition, and so abstract from our mode of intuiting it, this is a noumenon in the ''negative'' sense of the term.{{sfn|Kant|1999|loc=A250/B307|p=267 (NKS)}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But if we understand by it an object of a non-sensible intuition, we thereby presuppose a special mode of intuition, namely, the intellectual, which is not that which we possess, and of which we cannot comprehend even the possibility. This would be 'noumenon' in the ''positive'' sense of the term.{{sfn|Kant|1999|loc=A250/B307|p=267 (NKS)}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The positive noumena, if they existed, would be immaterial entities that can only be apprehended by a special, non-sensory faculty: "intellectual intuition" (''nicht sinnliche Anschauung'').{{sfn|Kant|1999|loc=A250/B307|p=267 (NKS)}} Kant doubts that we have such a faculty, because for him intellectual intuition would mean that thinking of an entity, and its being represented, would be the same. He argues that humans have no way to apprehend positive noumena:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since, however, such a type of intuition, intellectual intuition, forms no part whatsoever of our faculty of knowledge, it follows that the employment of the categories can never extend further than to the objects of experience. Doubtless, indeed, there are intelligible entities corresponding to the sensible entities; there may also be  intelligible entities to which our sensible faculty of intuition has no relation whatsoever; but our concepts of understanding, being mere forms of thought for our sensible intuition, could not in the least apply to them. That, therefore, which we entitle 'noumenon' must be understood as being such only in a negative sense.{{sfn|Kant|1999|loc=B309|p=270 (NKS)}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The noumenon as a limiting concept===
Even if noumena are unknowable, they are still needed as a ''limiting concept'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=295CBB027ADE6D31BEA8AAABA8A8D8DC.journals?&amp;aid=8201604|last=Allison|first= H|title=Transcendental Realism, Empirical Realism, and Transcendental Idealism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant tells us. Without them, there would be only phenomena, and since potentially we have complete knowledge of our phenomena, we would in a sense know everything. In his own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Further, the concept of a noumenon is necessary, to prevent sensible intuition from being extended to things in themselves, and thus to limit the objective validity of sensible knowledge.{{sfn|Kant|1999|loc=A253/B310}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What our understanding acquires through this concept of a noumenon, is a negative extension; that is to say, understanding is not limited through sensibility; on the contrary, it itself limits sensibility by applying the term noumena to things in themselves (things not regarded as appearances). But in so doing it at the same time sets limits to itself, recognising that it cannot know these noumena through any of the categories, and that it must therefore think them only under the title of an unknown something.{{sfn|Kant|1999|loc=A256/B312|p=273}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, for Kant, the existence of a noumenal world limits reason to what he perceives to be its proper bounds, making many questions of traditional metaphysics, such as the existence of God, the soul, and free will unanswerable by reason.  Kant derives this from his definition of knowledge as "the determination of given representations to an object".{{sfn|Kant|1999|loc=B/137|p=156}}  As there are no appearances of these entities in the phenomenal, Kant is able to make the claim that they cannot be known to a mind that works upon "such knowledge that has to do only with appearances".{{sfn|Kant|1999|loc=B/xx.|p=24}}  These questions are ultimately the "proper object of faith, but not of reason".&lt;ref&gt;Rohmann, Chris. "Kant" ''A World of Ideas: A Dictionary of Important Theories, Concepts, Beliefs, and Thnkers.''  Ballantine Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The dual-object and dual-aspect interpretations===
Kantian scholars have long debated two contrasting interpretations of the thing-in-itself. One is the ''dual object'' view, according to which the thing-in-itself is an entity distinct from the phenomena to which it gives rise. The other is the ''dual aspect'' view, according to which the thing-in-itself and the thing-as-it-appears are two "sides" of the same thing. This view is supported by the textual fact that "Most occurrences of the phrase 'things-in-themselves' are shorthand for the phrase, 'things considered in themselves' (Dinge an sich selbst betrachten)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hume.ucdavis.edu/mattey/kant/TIILEC.HTM|author=Mattey, GJ.|title=Lecture Notes on the Critique of Pure Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although we cannot ''see'' things apart from the way we do in fact perceive them via the physical senses, we can ''think'' them apart from our mode of sensibility (physical perception); thus making the thing-in-itself a kind of noumenon or object of thought.

==Criticisms of Kant's noumenon==

===Pre-Kantian critique===
Though the term ''noumenon'' did not come into common usage until Kant, the idea that undergirds it, that matter has an absolute existence which causes it to emanate certain phenomena, had historically been subjected to criticism. [[George Berkeley]], who pre-dated Kant, asserted that matter, independent of an observant mind, is metaphysically impossible.  Qualities associated with matter, such as shape, color, smell, texture, weight, temperature, and sound are all dependent on minds, which allow only for relative perception, not absolute perception.  The complete absence of such minds (and more importantly an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent mind]]) would render those same qualities unobservable and even unimaginable. Berkeley called this philosophy [[immaterialism]]. Essentially there could be no such thing as matter without a mind.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Schopenhauer's critique===
[[Schopenhauer]] claimed that [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] used the word ''noumenon'' incorrectly. He explained in his "[[Critique of the Kantian philosophy]]", which first appeared as an appendix to ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;But it was just this distinction between abstract knowledge and knowledge of perception, entirely overlooked by Kant, which the ancient philosophers denoted by [[noumena]] and [[phenomena]]. (See [[Sextus Empiricus]], ''[[Outlines of Pyrrhonism]]'', Book I, Chapter 13, '' ' What is thought (noumena) is opposed to what appears or is perceived (phenomena).' '') This contrast and utter disproportion greatly occupied these philosophers in the philosophemes of the [[Eleatics]], in [[Plato]]'s doctrine of the [[Ideas]], in the [[dialectic]] of the [[Megarics]], and later the [[scholastics]] in the dispute between [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], whose seed, so late in developing, was already contained in the opposite mental tendencies of Plato and [[Aristotle]]. But Kant who, in an unwarrantable manner, entirely neglected the thing for the expression of which those words ''phenomena'' and ''noumena'' had already been taken, now takes possession of the words, as if they were still unclaimed, in order to denote by them his things-in-themselves and his phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (vol. 1, Dover edition 1966, {{ISBN|0-486-21761-2}} p. 476-477)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The noumenon's original meaning of "that which is thought" is not compatible with the "thing-in-itself{{-"}}, the latter meaning things as they exist apart from their existence as images in the mind of an observer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

A '''Parse Thicket''' 
is a graph that represents the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a paragraph of text in [[natural language processing]]. A Parse Thicket includes [[Parse tree]] for each sentence for this paragraph plus some arcs for other relations between words other than syntactic.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Galitsky B, Kuznetsov SO, Usikov DA|title=Parse Thicket Representation for Multi-sentence Search |journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=7735 |date=2013 |pages=1072-1091| doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35786-2_12
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parse thickets can be constructed for both constituency parse trees and dependency parse trees. The relations which link parse trees within a Parse Thicket are:&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Galitsky B, Ilvovsky D, Kuznetsov SO, Strok F|title=Matching sets of parse trees for answering multi-sentence questions |journal=Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing |date=2013 |url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R13-1037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Coreferences]];
* The same entity / sub-entity / super-entity;
* Rhetorical Structure and other [[Discourse relation]];
* [[Speech act]]-based relations.

To assess similarity between texts, such as a question and its candidate answers, parse thickets can be generalized &lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Galitsky B|title=Machine learning of syntactic parse trees for search and classification of text|journal=Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence |volume=26 |issue=3 |date=2013 |pages=153-172|doi=10.1016/j.engappai.2012.09.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the image of parse thicket coreferences and entity-entity links are shown in solid red, and rhetoric/speech act relations are shown in dotted red. ETAP parser and tree visualization software is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author= Boguslavsky, I., Iomdin, L., Sizov V.| title=Interactive enconversion by means of the ETAP-3 system | journal= Culture, Language and Information Technologies |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To compute generalization of two parse thickets, one needs to find their maximum common sub-graph (sub-thicket).&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Galitsky B, Ilvovsky D, Kuznetsov SO, Strok F|title=Finding Maximal Common Sub-parse Thickets

The '''Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory''' is the argument that [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]] officials had advance knowledge of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s December 7, 1941, [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Ever since the Japanese attack; there has been debate as to how and why the [[United States]] had been caught off guard, and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans for an attack.&lt;ref&gt;''Pearl Harbor'', Charles Sweeny, Arrow Press, Salt Lake City, UT, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pearl Harbor: The Seeds and Fruits of Infamy'', Percy L.

==Ten official U.S. inquiries==
The U.S. government made nine official inquiries into the attack between 1941 and 1946, and a tenth in 1995. They included an inquiry by [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Frank Knox]] (1941); the [[Roberts Commission]] (1941–42); the [[Hart Inquiry]] (1944); the Army Pearl Harbor Board (1944); the Naval Court of Inquiry (1944); the Hewitt investigation; the Clarke investigation; the Congressional Inquiry (Pearl Harbor Committee; 1945–46); a top-secret inquiry by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]], authorized by Congress and carried out by [[Henry Clausen]] (the Clausen Inquiry; 1946); and the Thurmond-Spence hearing, in April 1995, which produced the Dorn Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/pha/dorn/dorn_0.html|title=Advancement of rear Admiral Kimmel andMajorGeneral Short on the Retired List

Jewell.)&lt;/ref&gt; The inquiries reported incompetence, underestimation, and misapprehension of Japanese capabilities and intentions; problems resulting from excessive secrecy about [[cryptography]]; division of responsibility between Army and Navy (and lack of consultation between them); and lack of adequate manpower for intelligence (analysis, collection, processing).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, ''Double-Edged Secrets''; Prange ''et al'', ''Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}

Investigators prior to Clausen did not have the security clearance necessary to receive the most sensitive information, as Brigadier General Henry D. Russell had been appointed guardian of the pre-war decrypts, and he alone held the combination to the storage safe.&lt;ref&gt;''Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement'', Henry C. Clausen and Bruce Lee, HarperCollins, 2001, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Clausen claimed, in spite of Secretary Stimson having given him a letter informing witnesses he had the necessary clearances to require their cooperation, he was repeatedly lied to until he produced copies of top secret decrypts, thus proving he indeed had the proper clearance.

Stimson's report to Congress, based on Clausen's work, was limited due to secrecy concerns, largely about cryptography. A more complete account was not made publicly available until the mid-1980s, and not published until 1992 as ''Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement''. Reaction to the 1992 publication has varied. Some regard it as a valuable addition to understanding the events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Kaiser |title=Conspiracy or Cock-up?

Clausen and Bruce Lee, ''Pearl Harbor: Final Judgment'' (New York: Crown Books, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; while one historian noted Clausen did not speak to General [[Walter Short]], Army commander at Pearl Harbor during the attack, and called Clausen's investigation "notoriously unreliable" in several aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Wohlstetter, ''Pearl Harbor – Warning and Decision'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statements by high-ranking officials ===
One perspective is given by [[Rear Admiral]] [[Frank Edmund Beatty Jr.]], who at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack was an aide to the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Frank Knox]] and was very close to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Social network|inner circle]], remarked that:

{{quote|Prior to December 7, it was evident even to me... that we were pushing Japan into a corner. I believed that it was the desire of President Roosevelt, and Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] that we get into the war, as they felt the Allies could not win without us and all our efforts to cause the Germans to declare war on us failed; the conditions we imposed upon Japan—to get out of China, for example—were so severe that we knew that nation could not accept them. We were forcing her so severely that we could have known that she would react toward the United States. All her preparations in a military way — and we knew their over-all import — pointed that way.&lt;ref&gt;Vice Admiral Frank E. Beatty, "Another Version of What Started the War with Japan," ''U. S. News and World Report'', May 28, 1954, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another "eye witness viewpoint" akin to Beatty's is provided by Roosevelt's administrative assistant at the time of Pearl Harbor, Jonathan Daniels; it is a telling comment about FDR's reaction to the attack – "The blow was heavier than he had hoped it would necessarily be. ... But the risks paid off; even the loss was worth the price. ..."&lt;ref&gt;''1941: Pearl Harbor Sunday: The End of an Era,'' in "The Aspirin Age – 1919–1941," edited by Isabel Leighton, Simon and Schuster, New York, 1949, page 490.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ten days before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]", [[Henry L. Stimson]], [[United States Secretary of War]] at the time "entered in his diary the famous and much-argued statement – that he had met with President Roosevelt to discuss the evidence of impending hostilities with Japan, and the question was 'how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.'"&lt;ref&gt;Cumings, Bruce: "Parallax Visions: Making Sense of American-East Asian Relations" Duke 1999 p. 47; Text above from Wikipedia's [[Henry L. Stimson]]&lt;/ref&gt; However Stimson, in reviewing his diary after the war, recalled that the commanders at Pearl Harbor had been warned of the possibility of attack, and that the poor state of readiness that the attack had revealed was a surprise to him:&lt;blockquote&gt;[Yet] General Short had been told the two essential facts: 1) a war with Japan is threatening, 2) hostile action by Japan is possible at any moment. Given these two facts, both of which were stated without equivocation in the message of Nov. 27, the outpost commander should be on the alert to make his fight&amp;nbsp;...

To cluster his airplanes in such groups and positions that in an emergency they could not take the air for several hours, and to keep his antiaircraft ammunition so stored that it could not be promptly and immediately available, and to use his best reconnaissance system, radar, only for a very small fraction of the day and night, in my opinion betrayed a misconception of his real duty which was almost beyond belief.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="Stimson.Time"&gt;quoted in {{cite journal|title=National Affairs: Pearl Harbor: Henry Stimson's View|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 1, 1946|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,792673-3,00.html|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stimson omits to mention the "war warning" message expressly told Short not to alarm the civilian population and to be alert for sabotage, which was widely expected to be a precursor to attack.

Robert Stinnett's ''[[Day of Deceit]]'' suggests a [[McCollum memo|memorandum]] prepared by Commander McCollum was central to U.S. policy in the immediate pre-war period. Stinnett claims the memo suggests only a direct attack on U.S. interests would sway the American public (or Congress) to favor direct involvement in the European war, specifically in support of the British. An attack ''by Japan'' would not, could not, aid Britain. Although the memo was passed to Captains Walter Anderson and [[Dudley Knox]], two of Roosevelt's military advisors, on October 7, 1940, there is no evidence to suggest Roosevelt ever saw it, while Stinnett's claims of evidence he did is nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, although Anderson and Knox offered eight specific plans to aggrieve the Japanese Empire and added, "If by these means Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better," of the eight "plans" (actions to be taken) offered in the memo, many if not all were implemented, but there is considerable doubt the McCollom memo was the inspiration. Nonetheless, in ''Day of Deceit'' Stinnett claims all action items were implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Notes for Chapter Two, paperback edition, pp. 321–322, notes 7, 8, and 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet there were numerous instances of members of the Roosevelt Administration insisting on not provoking Japan. Mark Parillo, in his essay ''The United States in the Pacific'', wrote, "[t]hese theories tend to founder on the logic of the situation. Had Roosevelt and other members of his administration known of the attack in advance, they would have been foolish to sacrifice one of the major instruments needed to win the war just to get the United States into it."&lt;ref&gt;Parillo, Mark, "The United States in the Pacific", in Higham, Robin, and Harris, Stephen, ''Why Air Forces Fail: The Anatomy of Defeat'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2006), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, on 5 November 1941, in a joint memo, [[Harold Rainsford Stark|Stark]], [[Chief of Naval Operations|CNO]], and [[George Marshall|Marshall]], Army Chief of Staff, warned, "if Japan be defeated and Germany remain undefeated, decision will still not have been reached.... War between the United States and Japan should be avoided...."&lt;ref&gt;Prange, Gordon W., Dillon, Katherine V., and Goldstein, Donald M. ''At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor'' (New York: Penguin, 1991), p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in a 21 November 1941 memo, Brigadier [[Leonard T. Gerow]], head of [[Army War Plans]], stated, "one of our present major objectives [is] the avoidance of war with Japan...[and to] insure continuance of material assistance to the British."&lt;ref name="Prange, 1991 p.369"&gt;Prange, ''et al.'', ''At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor'' (New York: Penguin, 1991), p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded, "[I]t is of grave importance to our war effort in Europe..."&lt;ref name="Prange, 1991 p.369"/&gt; Furthermore, Churchill himself, in a 15 May 1940 telegram, said he hoped a U.S. commitment to aid Britain would "quiet" Japan, following with a 4 October message requesting a USN courtesy visit to Singapore aimed at "preventing the spreading of the war"&lt;ref&gt;Prange ''et al.'', ''At Dawn We Slept'', p. 861.&lt;/ref&gt; And Stark's own [[Plan Dog memo|Plan Dog]] expressly stated, "Any strength that we might send to the Far East would...reduce the force of our blows against Germany..."&lt;ref&gt;Prange ''et al.'', ''At Dawn We Slept'', quoted p. 861.&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt could scarcely have been ignorant of Stark's views, and war with Japan was clearly contrary to Roosevelt's express wish to aid Britain and with Churchill's to "quiet" Japan.

One quote is often used to add legitimacy to the notion the British Government knew in advance of the attack. [[Oliver Lyttelton]], the British Minister of War Production, said, "...&amp;nbsp;Japan was provoked into attacking the Americans at Pearl Harbor. It is a travesty of history ever to say that America was forced into the war. Everyone knows where American sympathies were. It is incorrect to say that America was truly neutral even before America came into the war on an all-out basis."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Prange, ''Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; How this demonstrates anything with regard to Japan is unclear. Rather, it refers to other aid to Britain. [[Lend-Lease]], enacted in March 1941, informally declared the end of American neutrality in favor of the Allies by agreeing to supply Allied nations with war materials. In addition, Roosevelt authorized a so-called [[Neutrality Patrol]], which would protect the merchantmen of one nation, namely Britain, from attack by another, Germany. This made shipping legitimate target of attack by submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Holwitt, Joel I. ''"Execute Against Japan"'', Ph.D. dissertation, Ohio State University, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Roosevelt ordered U.S. [[destroyer]]s to report [[U-boat]]s, then later authorized them to "shoot on sight". This made the U.S. a ''de facto'' belligerent. None was the act of a disinterested neutral, while all are unquestionably of assistance to Britain.

When considering information like this as a point for or against, the reader must keep in mind questions such as: was this official privy to information about the U.S. government? Did he have communications with high-level administration figures such as President Roosevelt or Ambassador [[Joseph Grew]]? Is this just a strongly held personal opinion? Or were there measures justifying this view? If Britain, did, indeed know and chose to conceal, "withholding this vital intelligence only ran the risk of losing American trust",&lt;ref name="Parillo p.289"&gt;Parillo, in Higham and Harris, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; and with it any further American aid, which would be reduced after the attack in any event.

There is also a claim, first asserted in Toland's ''Infamy'', that [[Office_of_Naval_Intelligence|ONI]] knew about Japanese carrier movements. Toland cited entries from the diary of Rear Admiral J. E. Meijer Ranneft of the Dutch Navy for 2 December and 6 December. Ranneft attended briefings at ONI on these dates. According to Toland, Ranneft wrote that he was told by ONI that two Japanese carriers were northwest of Honolulu. However, the diary uses the Dutch abbreviation ''beW'', meaning "westerly", contradicting Toland's claim. Nor did any other persons present at the briefings report hearing Toland's version. In their reviews of ''Infamy'', David Kahn&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Review of Books'', May 27, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John C. Zimmerman]]&lt;ref&gt;''Intelligence and National Security'', Vol 17, No. 2, Summer 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested Ranneft's reference was to carriers near the Marshall Islands. Toland has made other conflicting and incorrect claims about the diary during lectures at the Holocaust denial organization the [[Institute for Historical Review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toland|first1=John|title=Living History|url=http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v11/v11p--5_Toland.html|website=Institute for Historical Review|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diary states at 02:00 (6-12-41) Turner fears a sudden Japanese attack on Manila. At 14:00 the diary states "Everyone present on O.N.I. I speak to Director Admiral Wilkinson, Captain MacCollum, Lt. Cdr. Kramer&amp;nbsp;... They show me – on my request – the place of the 2 carriers (see 2–12–41) West of Honolulu. I ask what the idea is of these carriers on that place. The answer was: 'perhaps in connection with Japanese rapports [sic] on eventual American actions'. There is not one of ours who speaks about a possible air attack on Honolulu. I myself did not think of it because I believed everyone on Honolulu to be 100% on the alert, as everyone here on O.N.I. There prevails a tense state of mind at O.N.I." These diary entries are provided (in Dutch) in the photo section in George Victor's ''The Pearl Harbor Myth: Rethinking the Unthinkable''.&lt;ref&gt;photograph section following page 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS correspondent [[Edward R. Murrow]] had a dinner appointment at the White House on 7 December. Because of the attack he and his wife only ate with Mrs. Roosevelt, but the president asked Murrow to stay afterwards. As he waited outside the Oval Office, Murrow observed government and military officials entering and leaving. He wrote after the war:{{r|sperber1998}}

{{quote|There was ample opportunity to observe at close range the bearing and expression of Mr. Stimson, Colonel Knox, and [[Cordell Hull|Secretary Hull]]. If they were ''not'' surprised by the news from Pearl Harbor, then that group of elderly men were putting on a performance which would have excited the admiration of any experienced actor. … It may be that the degree of the disaster had appalled them and that they had known for some time…. But I could not believe it then and I cannot do so now. There was amazement and anger written large on most of the faces.&lt;ref name="sperber1998"&gt;{{cite book | title=Murrow, His Life and Times | publisher=Fordham University Press | author=Sperber, A. M. | year=1998 | pages=206–208 | isbn=0-8232-1881-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One historian has written, however, that when Murrow met Roosevelt with [[William J. Donovan]] of the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] that night, while the magnitude of the destruction at Pearl Harbor horrified the president, Roosevelt seemed slightly less surprised by the attack than the other men. According to Murrow, the president told him, "Maybe you think [the attack] didn't surprise us!" He said later, "I believed him", and thought that he might have been asked to stay as a witness. When allegations of Roosevelt's foreknowledge appeared after the war, [[John Gunther]] asked Murrow about the meeting. Murrow reportedly responded the full story would pay for his son's college education and "if you think I'm going to give it to you, you're out of your mind". Murrow did not write the story, however, before his death.{{r|sperber1998}}

=== The McCollum memo ===
[[File:McCollum memo Page1.png|thumb|right|200px|The [[McCollum memo]]]]
{{Main article|McCollum memo}}

On October 7, 1940, [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Arthur H. McCollum]] of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] submitted a memo to Navy Captains [[Walter S. Anderson]] and [[Dudley Knox]], which details eight actions which might have the effect of provoking Japan into attacking the United States. The memo remained [[Classified information|classified]] until 1994 and contains the notable line, "If by these means Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better."

Sections 9 and 10 of the memo are said by [[Gore Vidal]] to be the "smoking gun" revealed in Stinnett's book, suggesting it was central to the high level plan to lure the Japanese into an attack. Evidence the memo or derivative works actually reached President Roosevelt, senior administration officials, or the highest levels of U.S. Navy command, is circumstantial, at best.  Regardless, the US Government followed all the recommendations of the McCollum memo, and the Japanese attacked the US as the McCollum memo indicated they might, and no evidence has been presented that indicates Roosevelt did not see it.

=== Roosevelt's desire for war with Germany ===
[[File:Avenge december 7.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. propaganda poster calling for revenge for the Pearl Harbor attack.]]

Theorists challenging the traditional view that Pearl Harbor was a surprise repeatedly note that Roosevelt wanted (though he did not say so officially) the U.S. to intervene in the war against Germany. A basic understanding of the political situation of 1941 precludes any possibility the public wanted war. [[Thomas Fleming (historian)|Thomas Fleming]] argued President Roosevelt wished for Germany or Japan to strike the first blow, but did not expect the United States to be hit as severely as it was in the attack on Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;{{cite web | last = Fleming | first = Thomas | title = Pearl Harbor Hype | publisher = [http://www.hnn.us/ History News Network] | date = 2001-06-10 | url = http://www.hnn.us/articles/89.html | accessdate = 2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attack by Japan on the U.S. could not guarantee the U.S. would declare war on Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Prange, ''Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History''?&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=December 2014}} After such an attack, American public anger would be directed at Japan, not Germany, just as happened. The [[Tripartite Pact]] (Germany, Italy, Japan) called for each to aid another in defense; Japan could not reasonably claim America had attacked Japan if she struck first.&lt;ref&gt;Prange?&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Germany had been at war with the UK since 1939, and with the USSR since June 1941, without Japanese assistance. There had been a serious, if low-level, naval war going on in the Atlantic between Germany and the U.S. since summer of 1941, as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Hitler'' versus ''Roosevelt''?; Toland, ''Japan's War''?&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was only Hitler's [[German declaration of war against the United States|declaration of war on 11 December]], unforced by treaty, that brought the U.S. into the European war.

Clausen and Lee's ''Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement'' reproduces a Purple message, dated 29 November 1941, from the Japanese Ambassador in Berlin to Tokyo. A closing paragraph reads, "... He (Ribbentrop) also said that if Japan were to go to war with America, Germany would, of course, join in immediately, and Hitler's intention was that there should be absolutely no question of Germany making a separate peace with England. ..."&lt;ref&gt;Clausen &amp; Lee, ''Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement'', p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David Irving]], Churchill (having full access to Purple traffic) was well aware of this message, noting it in red ink.&lt;ref&gt;David Irving, ''Churchill's War'', Volume Two, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; While theorists challenging the conventional view that the attack was a surprise, treat this as a guarantee to join after Japan's attack, it can as easily be taken as a guarantee to come to Japan's aid, as Germany had done for Italy in [[North African Campaign|Libya]].

==Assertions that Japanese codes had already been broken==
U.S. [[signals intelligence]] in 1941 was both impressively advanced and uneven. In the past, the U.S. [[Black Chamber|MI-8]] cryptographic operation in New York City had been shut down by [[Henry Stimson]] (Hoover's newly appointed Secretary of State), citing "ethical considerations", which inspired its now broke former director, [[Herbert Yardley]], to write a 1931 book, ''[[The American Black Chamber]]'', about its successes in breaking other nations' crypto traffic. Most countries responded promptly by changing (and generally improving) their ciphers and codes, forcing other nations to start over in reading their signals. The Japanese were no exception.

Nevertheless, U.S. cryptanalytic work continued after Stimson's action in two separate efforts: the Army's [[Signal Intelligence Service]] (SIS) and the Navy's Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) crypto group, [[OP-20-G]]. Cryptanalytic work was kept secret to such an extent, however, commands such as the 14th Naval District at Pearl Harbor were prohibited from working on codebreaking by Admiral [[Richmond Kelly Turner|Kelly Turner]] as a consequence of the bureaucratic infighting in Washington.

By late 1941, those organizations had broken several Japanese ciphers, such as J19 and PA-K2, called ''Tsu'' and ''Oite'' respectively by the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn's ''The Codebreakers'' has the specifies on these lower-level codes, beginning with LA, beginning on p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest security diplomatic code, dubbed [[Purple (cipher machine)|Purple]] by the U.S., had been broken, but American cryptanalysts had made little progress against the IJN's current ''Kaigun Ango Sho D''&lt;ref&gt;Wilford, Timothy. "Decoding Pearl Harbor", in ''The Northern Mariner'', XII, #1 (January 2002), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; (Naval Code D, called AN-1 by the U.S.;&lt;ref&gt;Wilford, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; JN-25 after March 1942).

In addition, there was a perennial shortage of manpower, thanks to penury on one hand and the perception of intelligence as a low-value career path on the other. Translators were over-worked, cryptanalysts were in short supply, and staffs were generally stressed. Furthermore, there were difficulties retaining good intelligence officers and trained linguists; most did not remain on the job for the extended periods necessary to become truly professional. For career reasons, nearly all wanted to return to more standard assignments. However, concerning the manning levels, "...&amp;nbsp;just prior to [[World War II]], [the US] had some 700&amp;nbsp;people engaged in the effort and [was], in fact, obviously having some successes."&lt;ref&gt;U,.S. Navy ''Oral History Interview'' conducted by Cdr. "Irv" Newman (USN Retired) on May 4, 5, and 6, 1983, of Robert D. Ogg, SRH-255, declassified on 17 November 1983, p. 23. Commander Laurence Safford, SRH-149, pp. 6 and 19, shows 730. (SRH-149, via the FOIA appeal process, had all remaining redactions removed in July 2009. There remain several redactions in SRH-255.)&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 85% were tasked to decryption and 50% to translation efforts against IJN codes.&lt;ref&gt;Safford, ''loc. cit.''.&lt;/ref&gt; The nature and degree of these successes has led to great confusion among non-specialists. Furthermore, OP-20-GY "analysts relied as much on summary reports as on the actual intercepted messages."&lt;ref&gt;Parillo, "The United States in the Pacific", in Higham and Harris, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. was also given decrypted messages by Dutch (NEI) intelligence, who like the others in the British–Dutch–U.S. agreement to share the cryptographic load, shared information with allies. However, the U.S. refused to do likewise.&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Baker, "Nanyo" 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; This was, at least in part, due to fears of compromise; sharing even between the US Navy and Army was restricted.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The eventual flow of intercepted and decrypted information was tightly and capriciously controlled. At times, even President Roosevelt did not receive all information from code-breaking activities.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} There were fears of compromise as a result of poor security after a memo dealing with [[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]] was found in the desk of Brigadier General [[Edwin "Pa" Watson|Edwin M. (Pa) Watson]], the President's military aide.&lt;ref&gt;''Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement'', Henry C. Clausen and Bruce Lee, HarperCollins, 2001, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purple===
The Japanese code dubbed "Purple", which was used by the Foreign Office and only for diplomatic (but not for military) messages, was broken by Army cryptographers in 1940. A 14-part message using this code, sent from Japan to its embassy in Washington, was decoded in Washington on 6 and 7 December. The message, which made plain the Japanese intention to break off diplomatic relations with the United States, was to be delivered by the Japanese ambassador at 1 p.m. Washington time (dawn in the Pacific). Colonel [[Rufus S. Bratton]], then serving as an aide to Marshall, took this to mean that the Japanese intended to attack at dawn somewhere in the Pacific. Marshall ordered a warning message sent to American bases in the area, including Hawaii. Due to atmospheric transmission conditions the message was sent out via Western Union rather than the usual signal channels and was not received until the attack was already underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillon|first=Steven M.|authorlink=Steven M. Gillon|title=Pearl Harbor: FDR Leads the Nation into War|year=2011|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-02139-0|pages=36–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim no pre-attack IJN message expressly mentioned Pearl Harbor is perhaps true. The claims that no Purple traffic pointed to Pearl Harbor may also be true, as the Foreign Office was not well thought of by the military and, during this period was routinely excluded from sensitive or secret material including war planning.  It is also possible any such intercepts were not translated until after the attack, or indeed, after the war ended; some messages were not.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Frederick D. ''Pearl Harbor Revisited: U.S. Navy Communications Intelligence 1928-1941''. (Ft. Meade, MD, undated PDF), pp.41 and 45. Found [https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/publications/wwii/assets/files/pearl_harbor_revisited.pdf here] (retrieved 16 May 2018). Stinnett, indeed, reproduces copies of messages not translated until after the war as "evidence". ''Day of Deciet'', pp.50 and 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In both instances, all traffic from these pre-attack intercepts has not yet been declassified and released to the public domain. Hence, any such claims are now indeterminate, pending a fuller accounting.

Additionally, no decrypts have come to light of JN-25B traffic with any intelligence value prior to Pearl Harbor, and certainly no such has been identified. Such breaks as recorded by authors W. J. Holmes and Clay Blair Jr., were into the additive tables, which was a required second step of three (see above). The first 100 JN-25 decrypts from all sources in date/time order of translation have been released, and are available in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]. The first JN-25B decrypt was in fact by [[Station HYPO|&lt;small&gt;HYPO&lt;/small&gt;]] (Hawaii) on 8 January 1942 (numbered #1 up JN-25B RG38 CNSG Library, Box 22, 3222/82 NA CP). The first 25 decrypts were very short messages or partial decrypts of marginal intelligence value. As Whitlock stated, "The reason that not one single JN-25 decrypt made prior to Pearl Harbor has ever been found or declassified is not due to any insidious cover-up... it is due quite simply to the fact that no such decrypt ever existed. It simply was not within the realm of our combined cryptologic capability to produce a usable decrypt at that particular juncture."&lt;ref&gt;The Truth About Pearl Harbor: A Debate, Stephen Budiansky The Independent Institute 1/30/03.&lt;/ref&gt;

===JN-25===
The [[JN-25]] superencrypted code, and its cryptanalysis by the US, is one of the most debated portions of Pearl Harbor lore. JN-25 is the U.S. Navy's last of several names for the [[cryptosystem]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], sometimes referred to as Naval Code D.&lt;ref&gt;''And I Was There – Pearl Harbor and Midway – Breaking the Secret'', Rear Admiral Edwin T. Layton (USN Retired) with Captain Roger Pineau (USNR Retired), and John Costello, William Morrow and Company, Inc., New York, NY, 1985, page 249 (taken from SRN-116741).&lt;/ref&gt; Other names used for it include five-numeral, 5Num, five-digit, five-figure, AN (JN-25 Able), and AN-1 (JN-25 Baker), and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Some writers, notably Stinnett, have refused to recognize "5Num" as JN-25, despite years of research. See comprehensive end remarks with references to examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

Superenciphered codes of this sort were widely used and were the state of the art in practical cryptography at the time. JN-25 was very similar in principle to the British "Naval Cypher No. 3", &lt;!-- This is the correct spelling in this instance. Do not change it. --&gt;known to have been broken by Germany during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;"Rhapsody in Purple: A New History of Pearl Harbor" in ''Cryptologia'', July 1982, pp. 193–229, and October 1982, pp. 346–467.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once it was realized what sort of cryptosystem JN-25 was, how to attempt breaking into it was known. Stinnett, in fact, notes the existence of a USN handbook for attacks on such a system, produced by OP-20-G. Even so, breaking any such code was not easy in actual practice. It took much effort and time, not least in accumulating sufficient 'cryptanalytic depth' in intercepted messages prior to the outbreak of hostilities when IJN radio traffic increased abruptly and substantially; prior to 7 December 1941, IJN radio traffic was limited, since the IJN played only a minor role in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war against China]] and therefore was only rarely required to send radio messages whatever the highest level crypto system might have been. (As well, interception of IJN traffic off China would have been at best spotty.) Rather oddly however, the official history of GYP-1 shows nearly 45,000 IJN messages intercepted during the period from 1 June 1941 until 4 December 1941. Thus, most Japanese encrypted broadcast military radio traffic was Army traffic associated with the land operations in China, none of which used IJN cryptography. &lt;!-- the Japanese Navy used the Japanese Army codes ... are you serious??? Do have another drink!!! OK. Let's rephrase as I thought it couldn't be misunderstood. Clear now? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broadly, the cryptanalytic approach was related to cryptanalytic attacks used as long ago as the early 19th century; Scovell's analysis survives from [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington's]] [[Peninsular Campaign]]. See Mark Urban, ''The Man Who Broke Napoleon's Codes: The Story of George Scovell'' (London: Faber, 2001).{{page needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breaking a superencrypted cipher like JN-25 was a three-step process: (a) determining the "indicator" method to establish the starting point within the additive cipher, (b) stripping away the superencryption to expose the bare code, and then (c) breaking the code itself. When JN-25 was first detected and recognized, such intercepted messages as were interceptable were collected (at assorted intercept stations around the Pacific by the Navy) in an attempt to accumulate sufficient depth to attempt to strip away the superencryption. Success at doing so was termed by the cryptographers a 'break' into the system. Such a break did not always produce a cleartext version of the intercepted message; only a break in third phase could do so. Only after breaking the underlying code (another difficult process) would the message be available, and even then its meaning—in an intelligence sense—might be less than fully clear.

When a new edition was released, the cryptographers were forced to start again. The original JN-25A system replaced the 'Blue' code (as Americans called it), and used five-digit numbers, each divisible by three (and so usable as a quick, and somewhat reliable, error check, as well as something of a 'crib' to cryptanalysts), giving a total of 33,334 legal code values. To make it harder to crack a code value, meaningless additives (from a large table or book of five-digit numbers) were added arithmetically to each five-digit cipher element. JN-25B superseded the first release of JN-25 at the start of December 1940. JN-25B had 55,000 valid words, and while it initially used the same additive list, this was soon changed and the cryptanalysts found themselves entirely locked out again.

Over the years, various claims have been made as to the progress made decrypting this system, and arguments made over when it was readable (in whole or part). Lt. "Honest John" Leitwiler,&lt;ref&gt;PHA, Part 10, p. 4810.&lt;/ref&gt; Commander of [[Station CAST]], the Philippines, stated in November 1941 that his staff could “walk right across” the number columns of the coded messages. He is frequently quoted in support of claims JN-25 was then mostly readable. This comment, however, refers not to the message itself but to the superenciphering additives and referred to the ease of attacking the code using a new method for discovery of additive values.

The 16 November 1941 letter&lt;ref&gt;Navy Department, Philippines Operations Summaries, 3200/1-NSRS.&lt;/ref&gt; to L.W. Parks (OP-20-GY) sent by Leitwiler states, "We have stopped work on the period 1 February to 31 July as we have all we can do to keep up with the current period. We are reading enough current traffic to keep two translators very busy." Another document, Exhibit No. 151 (Memoranda from Captain L. F. Safford) from the Hewitt Inquiry&lt;ref&gt;See Congressional Hearings on Pearl Harbor Attack, Part 18, page 3335, archived at [https://archive.org/details/pearlharborattac18unit Archive.org].

Com 16's estimates were more reliable than Com 14's, not only because of better radio interception, but because Com 16 was currently reading messages in the Japanese Fleet Cryptographic System ("5-number code" or "JN25") and was exchanging technical information and Japanese-to-English translations&lt;ref&gt;"The Codebreaking Process", A Man of Intelligence: The Life of Captain Eric Nave, Australian Codebreaker Extraordinary, Ian Pfennigwerth, Rosenberg Publishing Pty.

Whitlock, traffic analyst at &lt;small&gt;CAST&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Stinnett (note 8 to Chapter 2), Whitlock expressly contradicts Stinnett's thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; was not aware before the attack IJN movement traffic code was being read.

==Japanese intelligence==	
Japanese espionage against Pearl Harbor involved at least two ''[[Abwehr]]'' agents. One of them, [[Otto Kuhn]], was a [[sleeper agent]] living in Hawaii with his family. Kuhn was incompetent and there is no evidence he provided information of value. The other, [[Yugoslavia]]n businessman [[Duško Popov]], was a double agent, working for the [[XX Committee]] of [[MI5]]. In August 1941, he was sent by the ''Abwehr'' to the U.S., with an assignment list that included specific questions about military facilities in Oahu, including Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Masterman, J. C., ''The Double-Cross System'', appendix II.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[British Security Coordination]] introduced Popov to the FBI, the Americans seem to have paid little attention. It is possible that previous propaganda and forged or unreliable intelligence from the British contributed to [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s dismissing Popov's interest in Pearl Harbor as unimportant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Selling War: The British Propaganda Campaign against American "Neutrality" in World War II | author=Cull, Nicholas John | year=1995 | page=186 | isbn=0-19-508566-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is nothing to show his assignment list was passed on to military intelligence, nor was he allowed to visit Hawaii. Popov later asserted his list was a clear warning of the attack, ignored by the bungling FBI. The questions in his list were rambling and general, and in no way pointed to air attack on Pearl Harbor. Prange considered Popov's claim overblown, and argued the notorious questionnaire was a product of ''Abwehr'' thoroughness.

Furthermore, the Japanese did not need ''Abwehr'' assistance, having a consulate in Hawaii which had on its staff an undercover IJN intelligence officer, [[Takeo Yoshikawa]].&lt;ref&gt;Stinnett insists on using his covername, for reasons that are not clear.&lt;!--aim to confuse the issue?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The consulate had reported to IJN Intelligence for years, and Yoshikawa increased the rate of reports after his arrival. (Sometimes called a "master spy", he was in fact quite young, and his reports not infrequently contained errors.) Pearl Harbor base security was so lax Yoshikawa had no difficulty obtaining access, even taking the Navy's own harbor tourboat. (Even had he not, hills overlooking the Harbor were perfect for observation or photography, and were freely accessible.) Some of his information, and presumably other material from the Consulate, was hand-delivered to IJN intelligence officers aboard Japanese commercial vessels calling at Hawaii prior to the War; at least one is known to have been deliberately routed to Hawaii for this purpose during the summer. Most, however, seem to have been transmitted to Tokyo, almost certainly ''via'' cable (the usual communication method with Tokyo). Many of those messages were intercepted and decrypted by the U.S.; most were evaluated as routine intelligence gathering all nations do about potential opponents, rather than evidence of an active attack plan. None of those currently known, including those decrypted after the attack when there was finally time to return to those remaining undecrypted, explicitly stated anything about an attack on Pearl Harbor

== Detection of Japanese radio transmissions en route ==

=== Alleged detection by ''SS Lurline'' ===

There are claims that, as the ''Kido Butai'' (the Striking Force) steamed toward Hawaii, radio signals were detected that alerted U.S. intelligence to the imminent attack. For instance, the [[Matson Navigation Company|Matson]] liner {{SS|Lurline|1932|6}}, heading from [[San Francisco]] to Hawaii on its regular route, is said to have heard and plotted, via "[[relative bearing]]s", unusual radio traffic in a telegraphic code very different from International Morse&lt;ref&gt;''The ARRL Handbook for the Radio Amateur'', American Radio Relay League, Newington, CT.&lt;/ref&gt; which persisted for several days, and came from signal source(s) moving in an easterly direction, not from shore stations—possibly the approaching Japanese fleet. There are numerous [[Morse Code]] standards including those for Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, and Greek. To the experienced radio operator, each has a unique and identifiable pattern. For example, ''kana'', International Morse, and "Continental" Morse all have a specific rhythmic sound to the "dit" and "dah" combinations. This is how ''Lurline''{{'}}s radiomen, Leslie Grogan, a U.S. Navy reserve officer in naval communications, and with decades of maritime service in the Pacific&lt;ref&gt;Farago, ''The Broken Seal: "Operation MAGIC" – And the Road to Pearl Harbor, Bantam Books Paperback Edition, NY, 1968, Postscript "New Lights on the Pearl Harbor Attack", pages 379–402.&lt;/ref&gt; identified the mooted signal source as Japanese and not, say, Russian.

There are several problems with this analysis. Surviving officers from the Japanese ships state there was no radio traffic to have been overheard by anyone: their radio operators had been left in Japan to send fake traffic, and all radio transmitters aboard the ships (even those in the airplanes){{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} were physically disabled to prevent any inadvertent or unauthorized broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;Prange ''et al'', ''Pearl Harbor Papers''{{page needed|date=September 2011}}; ''Dai Toa Senso Senkun [Koku][Hawai Kaisen no Bu] Dai Ichi Hen'', Battle Lesson of Hawaii (a 1942 document) appendix in volume, [[Senshi Sōshō]]: Hawai Sakusen, Tokyo: Boeicho Kenshujo Senshishitsu; 1967; David Kahn, ''The Code Breakers'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kido Butai'' was constantly receiving intelligence and diplomatic updates.&lt;ref&gt;This is stated in the second edition of Prange, Goldstein, and Dillon's ''Pear Harbor: The Verdict of History''. The following analysis, based on his writings, is not universally conceded, eg by Goldstein.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether the ''Kido Butai'' broke radio silence and transmitted, there was a great deal of radio traffic picked up by its antennas. In that time period, it was known for a radio signal to reflect from the [[ionosphere]] (an atmospheric layer); [[Radio propagation#Ionospheric modes (skywave)|ionospheric skip]] could result in its reception hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Receiving antennas were sometimes detected passively 'rebroadcasting' signals that reached them (at much lower amplitudes, sufficiently low that the phenomenon was not of practical importance, nor even of much significance.  Some have argued that, since the ''Kido Butai'' contained a large number of possible receiving antennas, it is conceivable the task force did not break radio silence but was detected anyway.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Such detection would not have helped the Americans track the Japanese fleet. A radio [[direction finder]] (DF or RDF) from that time period reported compass direction without reference to distance. (Moreover, it was common for the receiving stations to report erroneous reciprocal bearings.)&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, ''Double-Edged Secrets''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2010}} To locate the source, a plotter needed two such detections taken from two separate stations to triangulate and find the target. If the target was moving, the detections must be close to one another in time. To plot the task force's course with certainty, at least four such detections must have been made in proper time-pairs, and the information analyzed in light of further information received by other means. This complex set of requirements did not occur; if the ''Kido Butai'' was detected, it was not tracked.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The original records of ''Lurline'' surrendered to Lt. Cmdr. George W. Pease, 14th Naval District in Honolulu, have disappeared. Neither ''Lurline''{{'}}s log, nor the reports to the Navy or Coast Guard by Grogan in Hawaii have been found. Thus no contemporaneously written evidence of what was recorded aboard ''Lurline'' is now available. Grogan commented on a signal source "moving" eastward in the North Pacific over several days as shown via "relative bearings" which then "bunched up" and stopped moving.&lt;ref&gt;''The Broken Seal: OPERATION MAGIC and the Secret Road to Pearl Harbor'' written by Ladislas Farago, Bantam Books edition 1968, "POSTSCRIPT – New Lights on the Pearl Harbor Attack," pp. 379–389.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Warning at Pearl Harbor: Leslie Grogan and the Tracking of the ''Kido Butai''" by Brian Villa and Timothy Wilford, ''The Northern Mariners/Le Marin du nord, Volume 11, Number 2 (April 2001), pages 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the directions given by Grogan in a recreation of the logbook for the Matson Line were 18 and 44° off from known strike force positions and instead pointed towards Japan. According to author Jacobsen, Japanese commercial shipping vessels are the likely source. A re-discovered personal report written by Grogan after the radio log had been passed to the 13th Naval District, dated 10 December 1941 and titled "Record for Posterity", also does not support claims of ''Kido Butai'' broadcasting. &lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, Philip H. "Pearl Harbor: Radio Officer Leslie Grogan of the SS Lurline and his Misidentified Signals", ''Cryptologia'', April 2005.{{pagneeded|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other alleged detections ===
The contention that "low-powered" radio (such as [[Very high frequency|VHF]] or what the U.S. Navy called [[Talk Between Ships|TBS]], or talk between ships), might have been used, and detected, is contradicted as impossible due to the tremendous distances involved&lt;ref&gt;Prange ''et al.'', ''At Dawn We Slept'', p. 743.&lt;/ref&gt; and when contact was lost, it was routinely presumed it was because low-powered radio and land line were being used.&lt;ref&gt;Wohlstetter, Roberta. ''Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision'' (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1965), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) requests for specific RDF reports remain wanting.&lt;ref&gt;Wilford, ''Pearl Harbor Redefined: USN Radio Intelligence in 1941'', University Press of America, 2001, p. 37, n. 72, p. 73, n. 146, and p. 107, n. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; "A more critical analysis of the source documentation shows that not one single radio direction finder bearing, much less any locating "fix," was obtained on any Kido Butai unit or command during its transit from Saeki Bay, Kyushu to Hitokappu Bay and thence on to Hawaii. By removing this fallacious lynchpin propping up such claims of Kido Butai radio transmissions, the attendant suspected conspiracy tumbles down like a house of cards."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, 2005, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

One suggested example of a ''Kido Butai'' transmission is the November 30, 1941, COMSUM14 report in which Rochefort mentioned a "tactical" circuit heard calling [[Japanese ship naming conventions|"''maru''s"]].&lt;ref&gt;SRN-116476&lt;/ref&gt; (a term often used for commercial vessels or non-combat units). Further, the perspective of U.S. naval intelligence at the time was, "...&amp;nbsp;The significance of the term, 'tactical circuit' is that the vessel itself, that is ''Akagi'', was using its own radio to call up the other vessels directly rather than work them through shore stations via the broadcast method which was the common practice in Japanese communications. The working of the ''Akagi'' with the Marus, indicated that she was making arrangements for fuel or some administrative function, since a carrier would rarely address a maru."&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Hewitt Inquiry, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japanese radio silence ===

According to a 1942 Japanese [[after action report]],&lt;ref&gt;"Dai Toa Senso Senkun [Koku][Hawai Kaisen no Bu] Dai Ichi Hen, Battle Lesson of Hawaii (a 1942 document) appendix in volume, [[Senshi Sōshō]]: Hawai Sakusen, Tokyo: Boeicho Kenshujo Senshishitsu; 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; "In order to keep strict radio silence, steps such as taking off fuses in the circuit, and holding and sealing the keys were taken. During the operation, the strict radio silence was perfectly carried out... The ''Kido Butai'' used the radio instruments for the first time on the day of the attack since they had been fixed at the base approximately twenty days before and proved they worked well. Paper flaps had been inserted between key points of some transmitters on board {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}} to keep the strictest radio silence..." [[Minoru Genda|Commander Genda]], who helped plan the attack, stated, "We kept absolute Radio Silence." For two weeks before the attack, the ships of ''Kido Butai'' used flag and light signals ([[Flag semaphore|semaphore]] and blinker), which were sufficient since task force members remained in line of sight for the entire transit time. Kazuiyoshi Koichi, the Communications Officer for {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}}, dismantled vital transmitter parts and kept them in a box that he used as a pillow to prevent ''Hiei'' from making any radio transmissions until the attack commenced.&lt;ref&gt;David Kahn, ''The Code Breakers'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Commander Chuichi Yoshoka, communications officer of the flagship, ''Akagi'', said he did not recall any ship sending a radio message before the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, E. T., 1985, ''And I was there'', p. 547, n. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Captain Kijiro, in charge of the ''Kido Butai''{{'}}s three screening submarines, stated nothing of interest happened on the way to Hawaii, presumably including signals received from the supposedly radio silent Kido Butai.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, P. H. (Burke, C. editor) (2007), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Vice Admiral [[Ryūnosuke Kusaka]] stated, "It is needless to say that the strictest radio silence was ordered to be maintained in every ship of the Task Force. To keep radio silence was easy to say, but not so easy to maintain." There is nothing in the Japanese logs or after action report indicating that [[Radio silence#Military|radio silence]] was broken until after the attack. Kusaka worried about this when it was briefly broken on the way home.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein and Dillon, ''The Pearl Harbor Papers'', pp. 136 and 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The appendix to the war-initiating operational order is also often debated. The message of 25 November 1941 from CinC Combined Fleet (Yamamoto) to All Flagships stated, "Ships of the Combined Fleet will observe radio communications procedure as follows: 1. Except in extreme emergency the Main Force and its attached force will cease communicating. 2. Other forces are at the discretion of their respective commanders. 3. Supply ships, repair ships, hospital ships, etc., will report directly to parties concerned." Furthermore, "In accordance with this Imperial Operational Order, the CinC of the Combined Fleet issued his operational order ... The Task Force ''then drew up its own operational order'', which was given for the first time to the whole force at Hitokappu Bay... In paragraph four of the appendix to that document, the especially secret Strike Force was specifically directed to 'maintain strict radio silence from the time of their departure from the Inland Sea. Their communications will be handled entirely on the general broadcast communications net.'"&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein and Dillon, eds. ''The Pearl Harbor Papers: Inside the Japanese Plans'', p. 149, "Operational Plan Given to Whole Fleet at Hitokappu Bay."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Jacobsen, p. 14, "Pearl Harbor: Who Deceived Whom?" letter section, ''Naval History'' 2/05.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Genda recalled, in a 1947 interview, ''Kido Butai''{{'}}s communications officer issuing this order, with the task force to rely (as might be expected) on flag and blinker.&lt;ref&gt;Prange ''et al.'', ''At Dawn we Slept'', pp. 377 &amp; 784, n. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio deception measures ==
The Japanese practiced radio [[Military deception|deception]]. Susumu Ishiguru, intelligence and communications officer for [[Carrier Division Two]], stated, "Every day false communications emanated from Kyushu at the same time and same wavelength as during the training period." Because of this, Commander [[Joseph Rochefort]] of [[Station HYPO|Hawaii Signals Intelligence]] concluded that the First Air Fleet remained in home waters for routine training. The ships left their own regular wireless operators behind to carry on "routine" radio traffic. Captain Sadatoshi Tomioka stated, "The main force in the Inland Sea and the land-based air units carried out deceptive communications to indicate the carriers were training in the Kyushu area." The main Japanese naval bases (Yokosuka, Kure, and Sasebo) all engaged in considerable radio deception. Analysis of the bearings from Navy DF stations account for claimed breaks of radio silence, and when plotted, the bearings point to Japanese naval bases, not where the ''Kido Butai'' actually was.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, "Pearl Harbor: Who Deceived Whom?", ''Naval History Magazine'' December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November, &lt;small&gt;CAST&lt;/small&gt; reported all Japan's aircraft carriers were at their home bases.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Frederick D. ''Pearl Harbor Revisited: U.S. Navy Communications Intelligence 1928-1941''. (Ft. Meade, MD, undated PDF), p.42. Found [https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/publications/wwii/assets/files/pearl_harbor_revisited.pdf here] (retrieved 16 May 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;
Rochefort,&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt Inquiry Testimony, PHA Part 36, Page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; with Huckins and Williams,&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Costello, and Pineau, ''And I Was There: Pearl Harbor and Midway – Breaking the Secrets'' (William Morrow and Co., 1985), p. 547, footnote 19, ''Did the Japanese Paint Us a Picture''.&lt;/ref&gt; states there were no dummy messages used at any time throughout 1941 and no effort by the Japanese to use serious deception.

When asked after the attack just how he knew where ''Akagi'' was, Rochefort&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; (who commanded &lt;small&gt;HYPO&lt;/small&gt; at the time) said he recognized her "same ham-fisted" radio operators. (The Japanese contend that radio operators were left behind as part of the deception operation.) The critical DF-tracked radio transmissions show bearings that could have not come from the strike force. Emissions monitored from &lt;small&gt;CAST&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Wilford, T. (2001) ''Pearl Harbor Redefined: USN Radio Intelligence in 1941'', pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; or &lt;small&gt;CAST&lt;/small&gt;'s report ''Akagi'' was off Okinawa on 8 December 1941, are examples, though some transmissions continue to be debated.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, P. H. Burke C. (2007) ''Radio Silence of the Pearl Harbor Strike Force Confirmed Again: The Saga of Secret Message Serial (SMS) Numbers'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. contact with Japanese submarines ==

Additionally, Japanese submarines were sighted and attacked (by the destroyer {{USS|Ward|DD-139|2}}) outside the harbor entrance a few hours before the attack commenced, and at least one was sunk—all before the planes began launching. This might have provided enough notice to disperse aircraft and fly off reconnaissance, except, yet again, reactions of the duty officers were tardy. It has been argued that failure to follow up on DF bearings saved {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}. If she had been correctly directed, she might have run into the six carrier Japanese strike force.

After the attack, the search for the attack force was concentrated south of Pearl Harbor, continuing the confusion and ineffectiveness of the American response.

==Allied intelligence==
Locally, Naval Intelligence in Hawaii had been tapping telephones at the Japanese Consulate before the 7th. Among much routine traffic was overheard a most peculiar discussion of flowers in a call to Tokyo (the significance of which is still publicly opaque and which was discounted in Hawaii at the time), but the Navy's tap was discovered and removed in the first week of December. The local FBI field office was informed of neither the tap nor its removal; the local FBI Agent in charge later claimed he would have had installed one of his own had he known the Navy's had been disconnected.

Throughout 1941, the U.S., Britain, and the Netherlands collected considerable evidence suggesting Japan was planning some new military adventure. The Japanese attack on the U.S. in December was essentially a side operation to the main Japanese thrust to the South against [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and the [[Philippines]]&amp;mdash;many more resources, especially Imperial Army resources, were devoted to these attacks as compared to Pearl Harbor. Many in the Japanese military (both Army and Navy) had disagreed with Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s idea of attacking the U.S. Fleet at Pearl Harbor when it was first proposed in early 1941, and remained reluctant after the Navy approved planning and training for an attack beginning in spring 1941, and through the highest level Imperial Conferences in September and November which first approved it as policy (allocation of resources, preparation for execution), and then authorized the attack. The Japanese focus on Southeast Asia was quite accurately reflected in U.S. intelligence assessments; there were warnings of attacks against [[Thailand]] (the Kra Peninsula), Malaya, [[French Indochina]], the [[Dutch East Indies]] (Davao-Weigo Line), the Philippines, even [[Russia]]. Pearl Harbor was not mentioned. In fact, when the final part of the "14-Part Message" (also called the "one o'clock message") crossed Kramer's desk, he cross-referenced the time (''per'' usual practice, not the brainwave often portrayed) and tried to connect the timing to a Japanese convoy (the Thai invasion force) recently detected by Admiral [[Thomas C. Hart|Hart]] in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Prange, Gordon W., ''et al.'' ''December 7, 1941'' (McGraw-Hill, 1988), pp. 60 and 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Navy was aware of the traditional planning of the Imperial Japanese Navy for war with the U.S., as maintained throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s. The Japanese made no secret of it, and in the 1930s American radio intelligence gave U.S. war planners considerable insight in Japanese naval exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Prados, ''Combined Fleet Decoded'', pp. 61 and 87.&lt;/ref&gt; These plans presumed there would be a large ''decisive battle'' between Japanese and U.S. battleships, but this would be fought near Japan, after the numerical superiority of the U.S. Pacific Fleet (assured by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], and still taken as given) was whittled down by primarily night attacks by light forces, such as destroyers and submarines.&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Peattie, ''Kaigun'', pp. 286–291.&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy expected the Japanese fleet to take a defensive posture, awaiting U.S. attack, and it was confirmed by the Japanese Navy staff only three weeks before Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Peattie, ''Kaigun'', p. 482.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the decisive battle was supposed to happen near the Ryukyu islands; in 1940 it was expected to occur in the central Pacific, near the Marshall islands. [[War Plan Orange]] reflected this in its own planning for an advance across the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Prados, ''Combined Fleet Decoded'', p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Yamamoto's decision to shift the focus of the confrontation with the U.S. as far east as Pearl Harbor, and to use his aircraft carriers to cripple the American battleships, was a radical enough departure from previous doctrine to leave analysts in the dark.

There had been a specific claim of a plan for an attack on Pearl Harbor from the [[Peru]]vian Ambassador to Japan in early 1941. (The source of this intelligence was traced to the Ambassador's Japanese cook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}{{self-published inline|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was treated with skepticism, and properly so, given the nascent state of planning for the attack at the time and the unreliability of the source.) Since Yamamoto had not yet decided to even argue for an attack on Pearl Harbor, discounting Ambassador Grew's report to Washington in early 1941 was quite sensible. Later reports from a Korean labor organization also seem to have been regarded as unlikely, though they may have had better grounding in actual IJN actions. In August 1941, British Intelligence, MI6, dispatched its agent Duško Popov, code name Tricycle, to Washington to alert the FBI about German requests for detailed intelligence about defenses at Pearl Harbor, indicating that the request had come from Japan.  Popov&lt;ref&gt;(Spy/Counterspy)&lt;/ref&gt; further revealed that the Japanese had requested detailed information about the British attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto. For whatever reason, the FBI took no action.

=== British advance knowledge and withholding claims ===

Several authors have controversially claimed that Winston Churchill had significant advance knowledge of the attack on Pearl Harbor but intentionally chose not to share this information with the Americans in order to secure their participation in the war. These authors allege that Churchill knew that the Japanese were planning an imminent attack against the United States by mid-November of 1941. They furthermore claim that Churchill knew that the Japanese fleet was leaving port on November 26, 1941 to an unknown destination. Finally, they claim that on December 2nd, the British intercepted Admiral Yamamoto's signal indicating December 7th as the day of an attack.&lt;ref name="Rusbridger 1991"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rusbridger |first=James |title=Betrayal at Pearl Harbor : how Churchill lured Roosevelt into World War II |publisher=Summit Books |publication-place=New York |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-671-70805-4 |oclc=23692496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Irving |first=David |title=Churchill and U.S. entry into World War II |year=1989 |volume=9 |number=3 |p=261-286 |url=https://www.historiography-project.com/jhrchives/v09/v09p261_Irving.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Costello 1982 p.

One story from author Constantine Fitzgibbon claimed that a letter received from V. F. W. Cavendish-Bentinck stated Britain's JIC met and discussed at length the impending Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. From a Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee session of 5 December 1941&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgibbon, ''Secret Intelligence in the Twentieth Century'' (Hart-Davis, 1976), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; it was stated "We knew that they changed course. I remember presiding over a J.I.C. meeting and being told that a Japanese fleet was sailing in the direction of Hawaii, asking 'Have we informed our transatlantic brethren?' and receiving an affirmative reply." However the author was incorrect. There was no session on 5 December nor was Pearl Harbor discussed when they did meet on 3 December.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Richard J.

==Official U.S. war warnings==
In late November 1941, both the U.S. Navy and Army sent explicit warnings of war with Japan to all Pacific commands. Although these plainly stated the high probability of imminent war with Japan, and instructed recipients to be accordingly on alert for war, they did not mention the likelihood of an attack on Pearl Harbor itself, instead focusing on the Far East. Washington forwarded none of the raw intelligence it had, and little of its intelligence estimates (after analysis), to Hawaiian commanders, Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]] and General [[Walter Short|Walter C. Short]]. Washington did not solicit their views about likelihood of war or Hawaiian special concerns. Washington's war warning messages have also been criticised by some (e.g., the U.S. Army Pearl Harbor Board – "Do/Don't Messages") as containing "conflicting and imprecise" language.

Since the Army was officially responsible for the security of the Pearl Harbor facilities and Hawaiian defense generally, and so of the Navy's ships while in port, Army actions are of particular interest. Short reported to Washington he had increased his alert level (but his earlier change in meaning for those levels was not understood in Washington and led to misunderstanding there about what he was really doing). In addition, Short's main concern was sabotage from [[fifth columnist]]s (expected to precede the outbreak of war for decades preceding the attack),&lt;ref&gt;Stefan, John J. ''Hawaii Under the Rising Sun'' (Honolulu : University of Hawaii Press, 1984.), pp. 55–62.&lt;/ref&gt; which accounts for his orders that Army Air Corps planes be parked close together near the center of the airfields. There seems to have been no increased Army urgency about getting its existing radar equipment properly integrated with the local command and control in the year it had been available and operational in Hawaii before the attack. Leisurely radar training continued and the recently organized early warning center was left minimally staffed. Anti-aircraft guns remained in a state of low readiness, with ammunition in secured lockers. Neither Army long-range bombers nor Navy PBYs were used effectively, remaining on a peacetime maintenance and use schedule. Short evidently failed to understand he had the responsibility to defend the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Prange, Gordon W., Goldstein, Donald M., &amp; Dillon, Katherine V. ''December 7, 1941'' (New York : McGraw-Hill, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; In Short's defense, it should be noted he had training responsibilities to meet, and the best patrol aircraft, B-17s and B-24s, were in demand in the Philippines and Britain, both of which had higher priority.

Little was done to prepare for air attack. [[interservice rivalry|Inter-service rivalries]] between Kimmel and Short did not improve the situation. Particularly, most intelligence information was sent to Kimmel, assuming he would relay it to Short, and ''vice versa''; this assumption was honored mostly in the breach. Hawaii did not have a Purple cipher machine (although, by agreement at the highest levels between U.S. and UK cryptographic establishments, four had been delivered to the British by October 1941), so Hawaii remained dependent on Washington for intelligence from that (militarily limited) source. However, since Short had no liaison with Kimmel's intelligence staff, he was usually left out of the loop. [[Henry Clausen]] reported the war warnings could not be more precise because Washington could not risk Japan guessing the U.S. was reading important parts of their traffic (most importantly Purple), as well as because neither was cleared to receive Purple.
 
Clausen does not answer why Washington could not have said "an exceptionally reliable source" was involved, with very strong instructions to pay attention. Additionally, Clausen claims military men of Kimmel and Short's seniority and background should have understood the significance of the warnings, and should have been more vigilant than they were, as for instance in scouting plane flights from Hawaii, which were partial at best in the period just before the attack. All other Pacific commands took appropriate measures{{cn|date=September 2017}} for their situations.

Like most commentators, Clausen ignores what the "war warnings" (and their context) explicitly warn, though indistinctly, against. Washington, with more complete intelligence than any field command, expected an attack anywhere on a list of possible locations (Pearl Harbor not among them), and since the Japanese were already committed to Thailand, it seems to have been expected another major operation by them was impossible. Clausen, like most, also ignores what actions Kimmel, Short, and Admiral [[Claude C. Bloch]] (Commander, Fourteenth Naval District, responsible for naval facilities in Hawaii) actually took. They took precautions against sabotage, widely expected as a precursor to war, and reported their preparations. The Hawaii commanders did not anticipate an air attack; no one did so explicitly. Indeed, the prevailing view at the time was Japan could not execute two major naval operations at once, so with the Thailand invasion convoy known to be at sea, the Hawaii commanders had good reason to feel safe.

One major point often omitted from the debate (though Costello covers it thoroughly) is the Philippines, where MacArthur, unlike Kimmel or Short, had complete access to all decrypted Purple and JN-25 traffic &lt;small&gt;CAST&lt;/small&gt; could provide (indeed, Stinnet quotes Whitlock to that effect),&lt;ref&gt;Stinnet, note 8 to Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and was nonetheless caught unprepared and with all planes on the ground nevertheless, nine hours after the Pearl Harbor attack. Caidin and Blair also raise the issue.

Although it has been argued that there was sufficient intelligence at the time to give commanders at Pearl Harbor a greater level of alert, some factors may take on unambiguous meaning not clear at the time, lost in what [[Roberta Wohlstetter]] in her masterful examination of the situation called "noise",&lt;ref&gt;Wohlstetter, ''Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision''.&lt;/ref&gt; "scattered amid the dross of many thousands of other intelligence bits, some of which just as convincingly pointed to a Japanese attack on the Panama Canal."&lt;ref name="Parillo p.289"/&gt;

==Role of American carriers==
None of the three U.S. Pacific Fleet aircraft carriers were in Pearl Harbor when the attack came. This has been alleged by some to be evidence of advance knowledge of the attack by those in charge of their disposition; the carriers were supposedly away so as to save them (the most valuable ships) from attack.

In fact, the two carriers then operating with the Pacific Fleet, ''Enterprise'' and ''Lexington'', were on missions to deliver fighters to Wake and Midway Islands, which were intended in part to protect the route used by planes (including B-17s) bound for the Philippines. (The third, ''Saratoga'', was in routine [[refit]] in [[Puget Sound]], at the Bremerton shipyard.) At the time of the attack, ''Enterprise'' was about {{convert|200|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} west of Pearl Harbor, heading back. In fact, ''Enterprise'' had been scheduled to be back on December 6, but was delayed by weather. A new arrival estimate put her arrival at Pearl around 07:00, almost an hour before the attack, but she was also unable to make that schedule.

Furthermore, at the time, aircraft carriers were classified as fleet scouting elements, and hence relatively expendable.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmott, ''Empires in the Balance'' and ''The Barrier and the Javelin'' (USNIPress, 1982 and 1983); Peattie &amp; Evans, ''Kaigun'' (USNIPress, 1997); Holmes, ''Undersea Victory'' (1966); Miller, ''War Plan Orange'' (USNIPress, 1991); Humble, ''Japanese High Seas Fleet'' (Ballantine, 1973); [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahan]], ''Influence of Sea Power on History'' (Little Brown, n.d.); Blair, ''Silent Victory'' (Lippincott, 1975)?; Morison's 14 volume history of USN ops in WW2.&lt;/ref&gt;  They were not [[capital ship]]s. The most important vessels in naval planning even as late as Pearl Harbor were battleships (''per'' the [[Alfred Mahan|Mahan]] [[doctrine]] followed by both the U.S. and Japanese navies at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Wilmott, ''Empires in the Balance'' and ''Barrier &amp; the Javelin'' (USNIPress, 1982 &amp; 1983); Peattie &amp; Evans, ''Kaigun'' (USNIPress, 1997); Holmes, ''Undersea Victory'' (1966); Miller, ''War Plan Orange'' (USNIPress, 1991); Humble, ''Japanese High Seas Fleet'' (Ballantine, 1973); [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahan]], ''Influence of Sea Power on History'' (Little Brown, n.d.); Blair, ''Silent Victory'' (Lippincott, 1975)?; Morison's 14 volume history of USN ops in WW2.&lt;/ref&gt; Carriers became the Navy's most important ships only following the attack.

At the time, naval establishments all over the world regarded battleships, not carriers, as the most powerful and significant elements of naval power. Had the U.S. wanted to preserve its key assets from attack, it would almost certainly have focused on protecting battleships. It was the attack on Pearl Harbor itself that first helped vault the carrier ahead of the battleship in importance. The attack demonstrated the carrier's unprecedented ability to attack the enemy at a great distance, with great force and surprise. The U.S. would turn this ability against Japan. Elimination of battleships from the Pacific Fleet forced the Americans to rely on carriers for offensive operations.

== Lack of court-martial ==

Another issue in the debate is the fact neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short ever faced court martial. It is alleged this was to avoid disclosing information showing the U.S. had advanced knowledge of the attack. When asked, "Will historians know more later?", Kimmel replied, "' ... I'll tell you what I believe. I think that most of the incriminating records have been destroyed. ... I doubt if the truth will ever emerge.' ..."&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, ''op. cit.'', pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt; From Vice Admiral Libby, "I will go to my grave convinced that FDR ordered Pearl Harbor to let happen.
He must have known."&lt;ref&gt;United States Naval Institute (USNI), Oral History Series, Vice Admiral
Ruthven E. Libby (Admiral King's staff), No. 4-230, Annapolis, MD, 1984. (Etta-Belle Kitchen
conducted the interviews of VADM Libby during the period February–June 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; It is equally likely this was done to avoid disclosing the fact that Japanese codes were being read, given that there was a war on.

==Unreleased classified information==
Part of the controversy of the debate centers on the state of documents pertaining to the attack. There are some related to Pearl Harbor which have not been made public. Some may no longer exist, as many documents were destroyed early during the war due to fears of an impending Japanese invasion of Hawaii. Still others are partial and mutilated.&lt;ref&gt;''Conclusions'' Section, from "Signals Intelligence and Pearl Harbor: The State of the Question" appearing in ''Intelligence and National Security'', Prof. Villa and Dr. Wilford, Volume 21, Number 4, August 2006, pp. 520–556.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information that is still currently classified includes key reports in Churchill's records, including the PREM 3 file in the UK's Public Records Office, which contains Churchill's most secret wartime intelligence briefs. In it, the 252 group dealing with the Japanese situation in 1941 is open, save for the omission of Section 5, dealing with events from November 1941 through March 1942, and is marked with official finality as "closed for 75 years."&lt;ref&gt;Costello, John. The Pacific War 1941–1945. p. 634&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Magic intelligence files released by the United States, none of the Ultra intelligence files pertaining to Japan have been released by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Costello, John. The Pacific War 1941–1945. p. 658&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflicting stories regarding FOIA ([[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]) requests for the source materials used, e.g., Sheet Number 94644, or materials available at the National Archives are also common among the debate. However, much information has been said to have been automatically destroyed under a destruction of classified information policy during the war itself. Various authors have nevertheless continued to bring classified Pearl Harbor materials to light via FOIA.

For instance, Sheet No. 94644 derives from its reference in the FOIA-released Japanese Navy Movement Reports of Station H in November 1941. Entries for 28 November 1941 have several more items of interest, each being a "movement code" message (indicating ship movements or movement orders), with specific details given by associated Sheet Numbers. Examples are: Sheet No. 94069 has information on "KASUGA MARU" – this being hand-written (''Kasuga Maru'' was later converted to CVE ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Taiyō|Taiyo]]''); Sheet No. 94630 is associated with IJN oiler ''Shiriya'' (detailed to the Midway Neutralization Force, with destroyers ''Ushio'' and ''Sazanami'', not the ''Kido Butai'');&lt;ref&gt;Prange ''et al.'', ''At Dawn We Slept'', pp. 435–6.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally for Sheet No. 94644 there is another hand-written remark "FAF using Akagi xtmr" (First Air Fleet using ''Akagi'''s transmitter). It is known that the movement reports were largely readable at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, ''Cryptolog'', Summer 1992, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

These three documents (Sheet Numbers 94069, 94630, and 94644) are examples of materials which yet, even after decades and numerous specific FOIA requests, have not been declassified fully and made available to the public. Sheet Number 94644, for example, noted as coming from ''Akagi'''s transmitter and as being a "movement code" report, would have likely contained a reported position.&lt;ref&gt;For an FOIA-released copy of this 28 November 1941 document, see Timothy Wilford's MA Thesis in History, University of Ottawa, ''Pearl Harbor Redefined: USN Radio Intelligence in 1941'', copyright Canada 2001, Appendix II, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forgeries ===

A purported transcript of a conversation between Roosevelt and Churchill in late November 1941 was analyzed and determined to be fake.&lt;ref&gt;''A Diplomatic Analysis of a Document Purported to Prove Prior Knowledge of the Pearl Harbor Attack'', by Srivastava, Kushner, and Kimmel, from ''Intelligence and National Security'', Volume 24, Number 4, August 2009, pp. 586–611.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are claims about these conversations; much of this is based on fictional documents, often cited as "Roll T-175" at the National Archives. There is no Roll T-175; NARA does not use that terminology.&lt;ref&gt;See also: [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/churchill-roosevelt-forgeries THE CHURCHILL-ROOSEVELT FORGERIES] at ''American Heritage'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13382">'''Phenomenalism''' is the view that physical objects cannot justifiably be said to exist in themselves, but only as perceptual [[phenomena]] or sensory stimuli (e.g. redness, hardness, softness, sweetness, etc.) situated in time and in space. In particular, some forms of phenomenalism reduce talk about physical objects in the external world to talk about ''bundles of sense-data''.

==History==
Phenomenalism is a radical form of [[empiricism]]. Its roots as an [[ontology|ontological]] view of the nature of existence can be traced back to [[George Berkeley]] and his [[subjective idealism]], upon which [[David Hume]] further elaborated.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Phenomenalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stuart Mill]] had a theory of perception which is commonly referred to as classical phenomenalism. This differs from Berkeley's idealism in its account of how objects continue to exist when no one is perceiving them (this view is also known as "[[local realism]]"). Berkeley claimed that an omniscient God perceived all objects and that this was what kept them in existence, whereas Mill claimed that permanent possibilities of experience were sufficient for an object's existence. These permanent possibilities could be analysed into [[counterfactual conditional]]s, such as "if I were to have ''y''-type sensations, then I would also have ''x''-type sensations".

As an [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory about the possibility of knowledge of objects in the external world, however, it is probable that the most easily understandable formulation of phenomenalism is to be found in the ''transcendental aesthetics'' of [[Immanuel Kant]]. According to Kant, space and time, which are the ''a priori'' forms and preconditions of all sensory experience, "refer to objects only to the extent that these are considered as phenomena, but do not represent the things in themselves". While Kant insisted that knowledge is limited to [[Phenomena (philosophy)|phenomena]], he never denied or excluded the existence of objects which were not knowable by way of experience, the things-in-themselves or [[noumenon|noumena]], though he never proved them.

Kant's "epistemological phenomenalism", as it has been called, is therefore quite distinct from Berkeley's earlier ontological version. In Berkeley's view, the so-called "things-in-themselves" do not exist except as subjectively perceived bundles of sensations which are guaranteed consistency and permanence because they are constantly perceived by the mind of [[God]]. Hence, while Berkeley holds that objects are merely bundles of sensations (see [[bundle theory]]), Kant holds (unlike other bundle theorists) that objects do not cease to exist when they are no longer perceived by some merely ''human'' subject or mind.

In the late 19th century, an even more extreme form of phenomenalism was formulated by [[Ernst Mach]], later developed and refined by Russell, Ayer and the logical positivists. Mach rejected the existence of [[God]] and also denied that phenomena were data experienced by the mind or consciousness of subjects. Instead, Mach held sensory phenomena to be "pure data" whose existence was to be considered anterior to any arbitrary distinction between mental and physical categories of phenomena. In this way, it was Mach who formulated the key thesis of phenomenalism, which separates it from bundle theories of objects: objects are ''logical constructions'' out of sense-data or ideas; whereas according to bundle theories, objects are made up of sets, or bundles, of ''actual'' ideas or perceptions. 

That is, according to bundle theory, to say that the pear before me exists is simply to say that certain properties (greenness, hardness, etc.) are being perceived at this moment. When these characteristics are no longer perceived or experienced by anyone, then the object (pear, in this case) no longer exists. Phenomenalism as formulated by Mach, in contrast, is the view that objects are ''logical constructions'' out of perceptual properties. On this view, to say there is a table in the other room when there is no one in that room to perceive it, is to say that ''if'' there were someone in that room, ''then'' that person would perceive the table. It is not the ''actual'' perception that counts, but the conditional ''possibility'' of perceiving.

[[Logical positivism]], a movement begun as a small circle which grew around the philosopher [[Moritz Schlick]] in Vienna, inspired many philosophers in the English speaking world from the 1930s through the 1950s. Important influences on their brand of empiricism included Ernst Mach — himself holding the Chair of Inductive Sciences at the University of Vienna, a position Schlick would later hold — and the Cambridge philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]].&lt;!--more on Russell and knowledge by acquaintance/description?--&gt; The idea of the logical positivists, such as [[Alfred Ayer|A.J. Ayer]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]], was to formulate the doctrine of phenomenalism in linguistic terms, so as to define out of existence references to such entities as physical objects in the external world. Sentences which contained terms such as "table" were to be translated into sentences which referred exclusively to either actual or possible sensory experiences.

20th century American philosopher [[Arthur Danto]] asserted that "a phenomenalist, believ[es] that whatever is finally meaningful can be expressed in terms of our own [sense] experience.".&lt;ref name="Danto-Nietzsche"&gt;[[Arthur Danto|Danto, Arthur]], ''Nietzsche as Philosopher'', Ch. 3,  § VI, Macmillan, 1965;&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that "The phenomenalist really is committed to the most radical kind of empiricism: For him reference to objects is always finally a reference to [[Empirical evidence|sense-experience]] ... ."&lt;ref name="danto-connections"&gt;[[Arthur Danto|Danto, Arthur]],  ''Connections to the World'', Ch. 27. Harper &amp; Row, 1989, {{ISBN|0-06-015960-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To the phenomenalist, objects of any kind must be related to experience. "[[John Stuart Mill]] once spoke of physical objects as but the 'permanent possibility of experience' and this, by and large, is what the phenomenalist exploits: All we can mean, in talking about physical objects &amp;mdash; or nonphysical objects, if there are any &amp;mdash; is what experiences we would have in dealing with them ... ." However, phenomenalism is based on mental operations. These operations, themselves, are not known from sense experience. Such non-empirical, non-sensual operations are the "...nonempirical matters of space, time, and continuity that empiricism in all its forms and despite its structures seems to require ... ."&lt;ref name="danto-connections" /&gt;

See for comparison [[Sensualism]], to which phenomenalism is closely related.

==Criticisms==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
[[Roderick Chisholm]] criticized the logical positivist version of phenomenalism in 1948.&lt;ref name="chisholm"&gt;Chisholm, R. "The Problem of Empiricism", ''The Journal of Philosophy'' 45 (1948): 512-7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[C.I. Lewis]] had previously suggested that the physical claim "There is a doorknob in front of me" necessarily [[logical consequence|entails]] the sensory conditional "If I should seem to see a doorknob and if I should seem to myself to be initiating a grasping motion, then in all probability the sensation of contacting a doorknob should follow".&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;C. I. Lewis, ''An Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation'' (LaSalle, Illinois: Open Court, 1946), pp. 240, 248-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Chisholm objected that the statement "There is a doorknob..." does not entail the counterfactual statement, for if it were to do so, then it must do so without regard to the truth or falsity of any other statement; but suppose the following statement was true: "I am paralyzed from the neck down and experience hallucinations such that I seem to see myself moving toward the door". If this were true, Chisholm objected, then there could be a doorknob in front of me, I could seem to myself to see a doorknob, and I could seem to myself to be performing the correct sort of grasping motion, but with absolutely no chance of having a sensation of contacting the doorknob. Likewise, he objected that the statement that "The only book in front of me is red" does not entail the sensory statement "Redness would probably appear to me were I to seem to myself to see a book", because redness is not likely to appear under a blue light-bulb. Some{{Who|date=April 2011}} have tried to avoid this problem by extending the conditions in the analysandum: instead of "There is a doorknob in front of me" one could have it that "There is a doorknob, and I am not paralyzed, etc." In response, Chisholm objects that if one complicates the analysandum, one must also complicate the analysans; in this particular case, that one must analyse in purely sensory terms what it means not to be paralyzed and so on, with respect to which the same problems would arise leading to an [[infinite regress]].

Another common{{Who|date=April 2011}} objection to phenomenalism is that in the process of eliminating material objects from language and replacing them with hypothetical propositions about observers and experiences, it seems to commit us to the existence of a new class of ontological object altogether: the [[sensibilia]] or [[sense-data]] which can exist independently of experience. Indeed, sense-data have been dismissed by some philosophers of mind, such as [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], as mythological entities that are more troublesome than the entities that they were intended to replace.

A third common objection in the literature{{Who|date=April 2011}} is that phenomenalism, in attempting to convert propositions about material objects into hypothetical propositions about sensibilia, postulates the existence of an irreducibly material observer in the antecedent of the conditional. In attempting to overcome this, some phenomenalists{{Who|date=April 2011}} suggested that the first observer could be reduced by constructing a second proposition in terms of a second observer, who actually or potentially observes the body of the first observer. A third observer would observe the second and so on. In this manner we would end up with a "[[Chinese boxes|Chinese box]] series of propositions" of ever decreasing material content ascribed to the original observer. But if the final result is not the ''complete elimination'' of the materiality of the first observer, then the translational reductions that are proposed by phenomenalists cannot, even in principle, be carried out.

Another criticism is that the phenomenalist can give no satisfactory explanation of the permanent possibilities of experience. The question can be asked, "What are the [[counterfactual conditional]]s which ground the existence of objects [[truth|true]] in virtue of?" One answer given by phenomenalists is that the conditionals are true in virtue of past regularities of experience. However, critics{{Who|date=April 2011}} object that this answer leads to [[circular logic|circularity]]: first our ''actual'' experience was meant to be explained by the ''possibility'' of experience, and now the ''possibility'' of experience is meant to be explained by our ''actual'' past experience. A further objection to the phenomenalist answer is that generally speaking, [[counterfactual conditional|conditionals]] are not true in virtue of their past occurrences. This is because it seems that a conditional could be true even if it never actually obtained, and also past occurrences only confirm ''that'' a conditional is true, but never make it so.

[[Roderick Firth]] formulated another objection in 1950, stemming from perceptual relativity: White wallpaper looks white under white light and red under red light, etc. Any possible course of experience resulting from a possible course of action will apparently underdetermine our surroundings: it would determine, for example, that there is ''either'' white wallpaper under red light ''or'' red wallpaper under white light, and so on. On what basis are we to decide which of the hypotheses is the correct one if we are constrained to rely exclusively on sensibilia?&lt;ref name="firth"&gt;Firth, R. "Radical Empiricism and Perceptual Relativity", ''Philosophical Review''. 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophical theism''' is the belief that a [[deity]] exists (or must exist) independent of the teaching or [[revelation]] of any particular [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]]| isbn = 978-0-333-80175-8| editors = D. Z. Phillips, Timothy Tessin| last = Swinburne| first = Richard| |author-link1=Richard Swinburne| title = Philosophy of religion in the 21st century| chapter = Philosophical Theism| location = Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire ; New York| series = Claremont studies in the philosophy of religion| date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents belief in a [[personal God]] entirely [[Freethought|without doctrine]]. Some philosophical theists are persuaded of a god's existence by philosophical arguments, while others consider themselves to have a religious faith that need not be, or could not be, supported by rational argument.

Philosophical theism has parallels with the 18th century philosophical view called [[Deism]].

==Relationship to organized religion==
Philosophical theism conceives of nature as the result of purposive activity and so as an intelligible system open to human understanding, although possibly never completely understandable. It implies the belief that nature is ordered according to some sort of consistent plan and manifests a single purpose or intention, however incomprehensible or inexplicable. However, philosophical theists do not endorse or adhere to the theology or doctrines of any organized religion or church. They may accept arguments or observations about the existence of a god advanced by theologians working in some religious tradition, but reject the tradition itself. (For example, a philosophical theist might believe certain [[Christian]] arguments about God while nevertheless rejecting Christianity.)

==Notable philosophical theists==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
*[[Thales of Miletus]] (624-546 B.C.) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher and mathematician from Miletus in Asia Minor. Many, most notably Aristotle, regard him as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition. According to Henry Fielding, Diogenes Laërtius affirmed that Thales posed "the independent pre-existence of God from all eternity, stating "that God was the oldest of all beings, for he existed without a previous cause even in the way of generation; that the world was the most beautiful of all things; for it was created by God."&lt;ref&gt;Fielding, Henry. 1775. An essay on conversation. John Bell. p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Socrates]] (469-399 B.C.) was a classical Greek Athenian philosopher; he is the earliest known proponent of the teleological argument,&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'' I.4.6; {{cite book |first = James|last= Franklin | title = The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | year = 2001| location = Baltimore| page = 229| isbn = 978-0-8018-6569-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is questionable if he abandoned polytheism.
*[[Aristotle]] (384-322 BC) founded what are currently known as the "cosmological arguments" for a God (or "first cause").&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle's Physics (VIII, 4–6) and Metaphysics (XII, 1–6)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chrysippus of Soli]] (279–206 B.C.) was a Greek Stoic philosopher. Chrysippus sought to prove the existence of God, making use of a teleological argument: "If there is anything that humanity cannot produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity cannot produce the things that are in the universe – the heavenly bodies, etc. The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, De Natura Deorum, iii. 10. Cf. ii. 6 for the fuller version of this argument.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452 – 1519) was an Italian polymath and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. According to biographer Diane Apostolos-Cappadona, "He found proof for the existence and omnipotence of God in nature—light, color, botany, the human body—and in creativity"&lt;ref&gt;Apostolos-Cappadona, Diane. "Leonardo: His Faith, His Art." Before 2 Nov. 2009. 26 Jan. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Marco Rosci, author of "Hidden Leonardo Da Vinci"(1977) notes that for Leonardo "[m]an is the handiwork of a God who retains few links with traditional orthodoxy. But man is emphatically no mere 'instrument' of his Creator. He is himself a 'machine' of extraordinary quality and proficiency and thus proof of nature's rationality".
*[[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629 – 1695) was a prominent Dutch mathematician and scientist. Huygens was first to formulate what is now known as the second of Newton's laws of motion in a quadratic form. He regarded science as a form of “Worship”, that is, one can serve God by studying and admiring his works: "And we shall worship and reverence that God the Maker of all these things; we shall admire and adore his Providence and wonderful Wisdom which is displayed and manifested all over the Universe, to the confusion of those who would have the Earth and all things formed by the shuffling Concourse of Atoms, or to be without beginning."&lt;ref&gt;Huygens, Christiaan, Cosmotheoros (1698)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sir Isaac Newton]] (1642 - 1726) was an eminent mathematician, often regarded as one of the three greatest mathematicians who ever lived, who hailed the opinion that god is there but all scriptures are lies and no one knows anything about the god. He also denied to recognise Jesus as the son of the god. Unfortunately, his works was found only later by Keynes. &lt;ref&gt; Keynes, J.M., 'Newton, The Man'; Proceedings of the Royal Society Newton Tercentenary Celebrations, 15–19 July 1946; Cambridge University Press (1947) &lt;/ref&gt; Also see the Wikipedia article "Isaac Newton Occult Studies."
*[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706 – 1749) was a French mathematician, physicist, her most celebrated achievement is considered to be her translation and commentary on Isaac Newton's work Principia Mathematica. In Du Châtelet's words, “[t]he study of nature elevates us to the knowledge of the supreme being; this great truth is even more necessary, if possible, to good physics than to morality, and it ought to be the foundation and conclusion of all the research we make in this science”&lt;ref&gt;Lascano, Marcy P., 2011, “Émilie du Châtelet on the Existence and Nature of God: An Examination of Her Arguments in Light of Their Sources”, British Journal for the History of Philosophy, 19(4): 741–58.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thomas Jefferson]] (1743–1826) was an American Founding Father who was the principal author of the United States Declaration of Independence. He argued for God's existence on teleological grounds without appeal to revelation.&lt;ref&gt;To JOHN ADAMS vii 281 1823 Jefferson Cyclopedia, Foley 1900&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]] (1796-1832) was a French military engineer and physicist, often described as the "father of thermodynamics". As a [[deist]], he believed in divine causality, stating that "what to an ignorant man is chance, cannot be chance to one better instructed," but he did not believe in divine punishment. He criticized established religion, though at the same time spoke in favor of "the belief in an all-powerful Being, who loves us and watches over us."&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Thurston, 1890., Appendix A. pp. 215-217&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777 – 1855) Sometimes referred to as the "Princeps mathematicorum" (Latin, "the foremost of mathematicians") and "greatest mathematician since antiquity". "According to biographer Dunnington, Gauss's religion was based upon the search for truth. He believed in "the immortality of the spiritual individuality, in a personal permanence after death, in a last order of things, in an eternal, righteous, omniscient and omnipotent God"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Mathematical Association of America| isbn = 978-0-88385-547-8| last1 = Dunnington| first1 = G.

*[[Sir Richard Owen]] (1804 -1892) was a comparative anatomist and paleontologist. He produced a vast array of scientific work, but is probably best remembered today for coining the word Dinosauria (meaning "Terrible Reptile" or "Fearfully Great Reptile"). Owen is also remembered for his outspoken opposition to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. He wrote "The satisfaction felt by the rightly constituted mind must ever be great in recognizing the fitness of parts for their appropriate function..the prescient operations of the One Cause of all organization becomes strikingly manifested to our limited intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;Owen, On the Nature of Limbs, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Abraham Lincoln]] (1809–1865) was the 16th President of the United States, serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. According to James W. Keyes, "A reason he gave for his belief [in a "Creator of all things"] was, that in view of the Order and harmony of all nature which all beheld, it would have been More miraculous to have Come about by chance, than to have been created and arranged by some great thinking power."&lt;ref&gt;352. James W. Keyes (statement for Willam H. Herndon).[1865 — 66]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823–1913) was a British naturalist, biologist and co-discoverer of natural selection. Wallace later began to doubt his own theory of natural selection and advocated a teleological form of evolution, in a letter to James Marchant he wrote "The completely materialistic mind of my youth and early manhood has been slowly molded into the socialistic, spiritualistic, and theistic mind I now exhibit."&lt;ref&gt;When I was alive by Alfred Russel Wallace, THE LINNEAN 1995 VOLUME 11(2), pp. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Martin Gardner]] (1914–2010) was a mathematics and science writer who defended philosophical theism while denying revelation and the miraculous. Gardner believed that many liberal Protestant preachers, such as [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]] and [[Norman Vincent Peale]], were really philosophical theists without admitting (or realizing) the fact.&lt;ref&gt;According to Gardner: "I am a philosophical theist. I believe in a personal god, and I believe in an afterlife, and I believe in prayer, but I don’t believe in any established religion. This is called philosophical theism.... Philosophical theism is entirely emotional. As Kant said, he destroyed pure reason to make room for faith."

'''''Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics''''' is a 1994 book by [[William Lane Craig]]. It began as a set of lectures for Craig's own class on [[apologetics]].

In 2008, Craig released the third edition of ''Reasonable Faith'', which featured mild revisions to the previous version. 

== Contents ==
William Lane Craig structured ''Reasonable Faith'' around the ''[[Loci Communes|loci communes]]'' of [[systematic theology]], and some of the most frequently discussed today include ''de Scriptura sacra'' (doctrine of Scripture), ''de creatione'' (doctrine of creation), ''de peccato'' (doctrine of sin), ''de Christo'' ([[Christology]]), ''de gratia'' ([[soteriology]]), ''de ecclesia'' ([[ecclesiology]]), and ''de novissimis'' ([[eschatology]]). For every topic, Craig first outlines the historical background of the issue in question to see how past thinkers have dealt with it. Second, he presents and defends his personal views on the topic, seeking to develop a Christian apologetic on the point. Third, he shares some thoughts and personal experiences on applying this material in evangelism. Finally, he provides bibliographical information on the literature cited or recommended for future reading.

'''Richard Merritt Montague''' (September 20, 1930 – March 7, 1971) was an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]].

==Career==
At the [[University of California, Berkeley]], Montague earned a B.A. in Philosophy in 1950, an M.A. in Mathematics in 1953, and a [[Ph.D.]] in Philosophy 1957, the latter under the direction of the mathematician and logician [[Alfred Tarski]]. Montague, one of Tarski's most accomplished American students, spent his entire career teaching in the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy]], where he supervised the dissertations of [[Nino Cocchiarella]] and [[Hans Kamp]].

Montague wrote on the foundations of [[logic]] and [[set theory]], as would befit a student of Tarski. His Ph.D. dissertation, titled ''Contributions to the Axiomatic Foundations of Set Theory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |last=Montague |first=Richard Merritt |date=June 1957 |title=Contributions to the axiomatic foundations of set theory |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url=http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b13106911~S1}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained the first proof that all possible axiomatizations of the standard [[axiomatic set theory]] [[ZFC]] must contain infinitely many axioms. In other words, ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.

He pioneered a logical approach to natural language [[semantics]] which became known as [[Montague grammar]]. This approach to language has been especially influential among certain computational linguists—perhaps more so than among more traditional [[Philosophy of Language|philosophers of language]]. In particular, Montague's influence lives on in grammar approaches like categorial grammar (such as Unification Categorial Grammar, Left-Associate Grammar, or [[Combinatory categorial grammar|Combinatory Categorial Grammar]]), which attempt a derivation of syntactic and semantic representation in tandem and the semantics of quantifiers, scope and discourse (Hans Kamp, a student of Montague, co-developed Discourse Representation Theory).

Montague was an accomplished organist and a successful real estate investor. He died violently in his own home; the crime is unsolved to this day. Anita Feferman and Solomon Feferman argue that he usually went to bars "cruising" and bringing people home with him.&lt;ref name="Feferman04"&gt;Feferman and Feferman 2004: 332-3&lt;/ref&gt; On the day that he was murdered, he brought home several people "for some kind of soirée", but they instead robbed his house and strangled him.&lt;ref name="Feferman04"/&gt;

'''Saviour Cumbo''' (1810–1877) was a Maltese theologian and minor philosopher. His philosophical writings deal mainly with the relationship between [[reason]] and [[faith]]. Though his engagement with philosophical reflection was peripheral, his contribution in this field was at least interesting and at most insightful.&lt;ref name="Montebello"&gt;

==Life==
Cumbo was born at [[Valletta]], Malta, in 1810. After entering the diocesan seminary and becoming a priest, he was entrusted with various administrative offices within the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malta|diocese of Malta]]. For many years he was the Vicar-General of the bishop. Concurrently, he taught theology at the [[University of Malta]].

In 1839, he began a periodical called ''Il Filologo'' (The Philologist), which was of a literary nature. He issued the periodical for three years. Furthermore, he published various booklets of general public interest. Cumbo died in 1877.

==Works==
Though Cumbo published profusely, mainly booklets of a few pages, a few of his publications have some philosophical interest, namely:

* 1839 - '''''Piano di Pubblica Instruzione''''' (A Plan for Public Education).&lt;ref name="Montebello" /&gt;{{rp|Vol.I p.264}} Published in Malta (Torchi di Francesco Cumbo), this 48-page book in Italian proposes a plan for public education of every level. The work begins with a preface and an introduction, and then is divided into three main chapters (with the last two sub-divided into 11 and 9 parts respectively.

: When speaking of university, Cumbo suggests that students should be given "a deep knowledge of philosophy". In a more concrete manner, he proposes six Chairs: for [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]], simple mathematics, pure mathematics, mathematical [[physics]], [[experimental physics]], and [[maritime studies]]. For [[experimental physics]], Cumbo suggests building state-of-the-art laboratories.

: While proposing his plan, Cumbo takes the opportunity to criticize the current course of philosophy at the [[University of Malta]]. He objects to the fact that the course includes Latin, Italian, and English literature, and also economic politics (which he finds "incompatible" with philosophy).

* 1839 - '''''Sul Giuramento''''' (On the Pledge).&lt;ref name="Montebello" /&gt;{{rp|Vol.I pp.204–205}} This 19-page booklet in Italian published in Malta (by Francesco Cumbo), reproduces a speech which Cumbo gave in 1838 to civil servants. The central part of the address deals with the problem encountered by [[Catholic]] workers who solemnly pledged their loyalty to a [[Protestant]] government (since at the time Malta was under British colonial rule). Though the local authorities of the [[Catholic Church]] had declared immoral such a pledge, Cumbo ventures to state in clear terms that it is not so. This irked the local bishop, who accused Cumbo of [[heresy]] before the [[Holy See]] in Rome. In response, Cumbo wrote ''Il Trenta Gennajo'' (below).
* 1839 - '''''Il Trenta Gennajo''''' (30 January).&lt;ref name="Montebello" /&gt;{{rp|Vol.II p.227}} A 19-page essay in Italian written by Cumbo and published in [[Malta]] (by Francesco Cumbo) in response to the accusations of heresy leveled against him after publishing the tract ''Sul Giuramento'' (above). Cumbo had appeared before the Holy See in Rome on 30 January 1839, hence the title of the booklet. The meeting left Cumbo disappointed. So much so that he then decided to publish this short pamphlet, which eventually he had to issue various editions of it. The writing is a lengthy address to the [[Bishop of Malta]], Francis Saverio Caruana, in which he explains the nature of the issue at hand (that is, on the pledge of Catholic civil servants in Protestant Malta) and describes, point by point, why he had declared it morally acceptable.
* 1839 - '''''Necessità delle Rivelazione per Guida dei Costumi''''' (The Need of Revelation as a Guide to Behaviour).&lt;ref name="Montebello" /&gt;{{rp|Vol.II p.149}} A 20-page pamphlet in Italian (published by the Tipografia Cumbo, Malta) reproduces an address given in 1839 by Cumbo at the ''Gioventù Maltese delle Sacre Scienze'' (Maltese Youth of Sacred Sciences). Cumbo examines the relationship between reason and faith. He does this with the issue of civil servants' pledge (see ''Il Giuramento'' and ''Il Trenta Gennajo'' above) at the back of his mind.
* 1839 - '''''Breve Cenno Sulle Lezioni Scritturali''''' (A Brief Note on Lectures of Scripture).&lt;ref name="Montebello" /&gt;{{rp|Vol.II p.161}} Published in [[Malta]] (Tipografia Cumbo), this 16-page pamphlet in Italian is a discussion on some aspects of the lectures given at the University of Malta on the Bible. With his typical passion and analysis, Cumbo makes a philosophical discussion on the relationship of reason to faith.
* 1844 - '''''Influenze del Cristianesimo sul Progresso delle Scienze''''' (Influences of Christianity on the Progress of the Sciences).&lt;ref name="Montebello" /&gt;{{rp|Vol.I p.100}} A 36-page book in Italian published in Malta (Tipografia di Francesco Cumbo) and dedicated to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Charles Januarius Acton]]. It reproduces an address given by Cumbo on 1 October 1844, in Valletta at the official opening of the academic year 1844-45 of the University of Malta. The work is divided into an introduction and another eleven main parts. Cumbo concentrates on the literary wealth of humanity, and philosophically discusses our relation to it and our appraisal of it.
* 1874 - '''''De Laudibus Sancti Thomæ''''' (In Praise of Saint Thomas Aquinas).&lt;ref name="Montebello" /&gt;{{rp|Vol.II p.219}} This 6-page leaflet in Italian published in Malta reproduces an address given by Cumbo at the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priory at Valletta. The initiative to publish the address was taken by Cumbo's students (called ''{{'}}discipulorum{{'}}'', disciples). The work is a rhetorical speech on [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Though containing some philosophical interest, the address is mainly oratorical.
* 1872 - '''''Elogio Funebre al Dr. Giorgio Caruana''''' (Funeral Oration for Dr. [[George Caruana]]).&lt;ref name="Montebello" /&gt;{{rp|Vol.I p.70}} The oration contained in this 21-page pamphlet in Italian (published at the Tipografia Strada San Domenico No. 75, Valletta), was delivered in May 1872 at the funeral of George Caruana. It is the work of a philosopher paying homage to another philosopher. Considering the occasion, no substantial philosophical material is to be found in this oration. Nevertheless, Cumbo does not deal superficially with the themes of life and death which he addresses.

Terms such as '''separate spheres''' and '''domestic–public dichotomy''' refer to a [[social phenomenon]], within [[modern society|modern societies]] that feature, to some degree, an [[empirical]] separation between a [[private sphere|domestic or private sphere]] and a [[Public sphere|public or social sphere]]. This observation may be  controversial, and is often also seen as supporting [[Patriarchy|patriarchal ideologies]] that seek to ''create or strengthen'', any such separation between spheres, and to confine women to the domestic/private sphere.

The patriarchal ideology of separate spheres, based primarily on notions of [[Biological determinism of human gender roles|biologically determined gender roles]]  and/or patriarchal religious doctrine, claims that women should avoid the public sphere &amp;ndash; the domain of politics, paid work, commerce and law. Women's "proper sphere", according to the ideology, is the realm of domestic life, focused on childcare, housekeeping, and religion.&lt;ref name="kuersten"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ryle |first1= Robyn |title= Questioning gender: a sociological exploration |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CHHz_p-j9hMC&amp;pg=PA342 |edition= |year= 2012 |publisher= SAGE/Pine Forge Press |location= Thousand Oaks, Calif. |isbn= 978-1-4129-6594-1 |pages= 342&amp;ndash;43|chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As observable phenomena, however, the existence of separate spheres is much older.

==History==
The idea that women should inhabit a separate domestic sphere has been extant in [[Western thought]] for centuries, extending as far back as the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Vickery |first1= Amanda | authorlink1 = Amanda Vickery | last2= |first2= |year= 1993 |title= Golden age to separate spheres?

Feminist writers like Olympe de Gouges, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Lucy Stone demanded political equality for women as well as men and provided searing criticisms of the "separate sphere" ideals that confined women exclusively to the domestic sphere. Theorists such as [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Karl Marx]] have argued that following the rise of capitalism, the home lost its control of the [[means of production]] and consequently became a private, separate sphere. As a result, Engels contended, women were excluded from participating directly in the production process and relegated to the subordinate domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to 19th-Century America|last1=Edwards|first1=Laura F.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=|year=2001|isbn=978-0-631-20985-0|editor1-last=Barney|editor1-first=William L.|editor1-link=|location=Malden, MA|pages=225&amp;ndash;226|chapter=Gender and the Changing Roles of Women|editor2-last=|editor2-first=|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=elgGfYla0hwC&amp;pg=PA225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major commentator on the modern idea of "separate spheres" was the French political thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name="kerber1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kerber |first1= Linda K. | authorlink1 = Linda K.

[[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' asserted that women were being forced to rely on their husbands and children as the sole sources of their identity by an historically constructed oppressive paradigm, not by any "intrinsic" predisposition. Drawing on Friedan, historian Barbara Welter identified a [[Cult of Domesticity|"Cult of True Womanhood"]], an ideal of [[femininity]] prevalent among the [[Upper class|upper]] and [[middle class]]es in the 19th century. "True women" were supposed to be pious, pure, submissive, and domestic. Domesticity, in particular, was regarded as a laudable virtue as the home was considered a woman's proper sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Welter |first1= Barbara |authorlink1=  |last2=  |first2=  |year= 1966 |title= The Cult of True Womanhood: 1820–1860 |journal= [[American Quarterly]] |volume= 18 |issue= 2 |pages= 151–174 |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |doi= 10.2307/2711179 |url= https://webstorage.worcester.edu/sites/thangen/web/Shared%20Documents/Welter.CultTrueWomanhood.pdf |accessdate=  |jstor= 2711179 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111113113000/https://webstorage.worcester.edu/sites/thangen/web/Shared%20Documents/Welter.CultTrueWomanhood.pdf |archivedate= 2011-11-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Tocqueville, Welter and other 20th-century historians were critical of the separate spheres ideology, seeing it as a source of women's denigration.&lt;ref name="kerber1988"/&gt;

In [[Woman, Culture, and Society]] (1974), [[Michelle Rosaldo]] emphasizes the idea that these separate spheres can be explained in terms of a dichotomy, in the sense that these gender-oriented domains are viewed as so totally separate that it only reinforces the ideology of gender separation and inequality. Activities given to men, versus those assigned to women, were seen as having more value and contributing greatly to the society. Adversely, the woman's so-called simpler roles of housework and childrearing were held at a much lesser value. Rosaldo argues a "universal asymmetry" between the sexes that primarily caused these separations to arise. This model mainly focuses on the generational subordination of women in relation to men throughout history and across different cultures, defining the domestic and public spheres in very black and white terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no:00972854|title=Woman, culture, and society|last=Rosaldo|first=Michelle Zimbalist|last2=Lamphere|first2=Louise|last3=Bamberger|first3=Joan|date=1974|isbn=0804708509|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This earlier model, however, has since been challenged by researchers in the field, claiming the spheres cannot be outlined in such simplistic terms. Woman, Culture, and Society&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/gender-in-cross-cultural-perspective/oclc/951536398?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|title=Gender in cross-cultural perspective|last=Brettell|first=Caroline|last2=Sargent|first2=Carolyn F|date=2016|isbn=9780205247288|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-editor Louis Lamphere breaks down Rosaldo's model and discusses the spheres in different terms. Lamphere primarily dispels the concept of "universal asymmetry", looking toward various societies worldwide for proof. Even in some Middle Eastern cultures that place women in extreme positions of subordination, the model could not be so easily applied. This is because the domestic and public spheres are almost always overlapping in some way, regardless of a cultural female subservience or even egalitarianism. Women enter public spaces in order to fulfill certain duties that fall within their domestic responsibilities. Men must return to the private, or domestic, space eventually to bring home the spoils of his labor in the public sphere. In this sense, there are two separate spheres created and enforced by gender ideologies; but they are not dichotomous. They, instead, form an integrated system of life in society, varying only in levels of intensities from culture to culture.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

According to Cary Franklin, the women’s rights movements in the mid-1960s proposed that to achieve true equality between the sexes, it is necessary for the laws to be put in place to move past the simple separate spheres model and address the “interspherical impacts”. In 1966, the National Organization for Women (NOW) pushed for equality of women in society and in the workplace and in order to attain this equality, there would have to be changes in family regulation. NOW stressed the importance of focusing on structurally altering the family sphere in order to then create gender equality in the education and workplace spheres. The family sphere is acting as a catalyst seeing that without a change in it, women would simply lack access to the opportunities that men already have available to them. Franklin also pointed out that the gender inequality among the American population in the 60’s and 70’s was a major contributor to the civil rights statutes of the Second Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bi.galegroup.com/global/article/GALE%7CA376853033/165d132476e2721e8ea83c8ef676695a?u=txshracd2548|title=Redirect Page|website=bi.galegroup.com|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Rotman, an anthropologist at Notre Dame, analyzed this concept of separate spheres specifically among the people of Deerfield, Massachusetts in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. In this community, there was a clear divide between men and women by means of a “proper allocation” in which females were given the domestic residence or sphere and the men were given the “economically productive agricultural land”. Men would migrate away from the women if agriculture was depleting in their given agricultural space. As the men were moving to work outside the home, women began to acclimate to the economic atmosphere and gain more opportunities in the public sphere with all the men working elsewhere. These women soon had various roles in the public and private spheres in Deerfield. As equal rights began to become part of the ideological framework in Deerfield, women found themselves voting in school boards, working on municipal water projects and working in fundraisers as men had done before them. Despite the traditional understanding of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century of completely separate public and private spheres, the Deerfield community challenged these “dichotomies of domesticity” and paved the way for equal rights for men and women.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Recent Commentary ==
A recent study by Jacqueline Henke explores the history of the separate spheres model in America. Henke points out that between 1820 and 1860 (a period sometimes called the dawn of separate spheres) three parenting models were common for two-parent, mother/father families:
&lt;br&gt;
1. Parenting duties are wholly the responsibility of mothers
&lt;br&gt;
2. Parenting duties are separated into fatherly responsibilities and motherly responsibilities
&lt;br&gt;
3. Parenting duties are shared equally among mothers and fathers.
&lt;br&gt;
According to Henke, many parenting books from this era suggested that mothers should take primary responsibility for their children. Yet, some parenting books argued that mothers and fathers should have separate childrearing duties or a completely equal distribution of childrearing responsibilities. Henke argues that, even during the height of domestic ideology and the dawn of separate spheres, parenting advice was not monolithic. Furthermore, the lived realities parents and families during this era were more diverse than the ideals of parenting books.

The '''Sonntagskreis''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: {{lang|hu|Vasárnapi Kör}}, "'''Sunday Circle'''") was an intellectual discussion group in [[Budapest]], Hungary, between 1915 and 1918. The main focus of the group was on the relationship between ideas and the social and historical context of those ideas, a line of thought that led towards the later concepts of "[[social history of art]]" and "[[sociology of knowledge]]''.&lt;ref name=stirton/&gt;

==The Sonntagskreis group==
The Sonntagskreis was founded in the autumn of 1915 by [[Béla Balázs]], Lajos Fülep, [[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]], [[György Lukács]], and [[Karl Mannheim|Károly (Karl) Mannheim]]; in December of that year Balázs noted the success of the group in his diary.&lt;ref name=gluck/&gt; Others members of the group at various times included [[Frederick Antal|Frigyes (Frederick) Antal]], Béla Fogarasi, Tibor Gergely, [[Edit Gyömrői]], [[Edit Hajós]], György Káldor, Juliska Láng, [[Anna Lesznai]], Erno Lörsi, [[Michael Polanyi|Mihály (Michael) Polányi]], László Radványi, [[Emma Ritoók]],&lt;ref name="Marcus1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Marcus|title=Georg Lukács and Thomas Mann: A Study in the Sociology of Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9i7V81yHZ2EC&amp;pg=PA198|year=1987|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|isbn=0-87023-486-2|pages=198–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Schlamadinger, Ervin Sinkó, Vilmos Szilasi, [[Charles de Tolnay|Károly Tolnay (Charles de Tolnay)]] and [[Johannes Wilde|János (Johannes) Wilde]].&lt;ref name=fenyo/&gt; Admission to the group required the assent of all existing members; members could bring guests to meetings.&lt;ref name=kettler/&gt; The group generally met on Sunday afternoons at Balázs' flat, and discussed literature and philosophy.&lt;ref name=fenyo/&gt;&lt;ref name=novak/&gt;

==The Free School of Humanist Studies==
In the spring of 1917 members of the group founded the {{lang|hu|Szellemi Tudományok Szabad Iskolájána}}, or "Free School of Humanist Studies", which for two semesters in 1917 and 1918 organised lectures in a school building in Budapest.&lt;ref name=fenyo/&gt; Guest lecturers included [[Béla Bartók]], [[Zoltán Kodály]] and [[Ervin Szabó]].&lt;ref name=weibel/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4810">'''Sophia Willard Dana Ripley''' (1803–1861), wife of [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]], was a 19th-century feminist associated with [[Transcendentalism]] and the [[Brook Farm]] community.

==Biography==
She was born Sophia Willard Dana in 1803. Her father traveled abroad often and left his daughters to fend for themselves. In 1823, during one of his trips, the Dana sisters decided to earn their own living by teaching. In [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], they established a girls' school; Sophia Dana served as the principal teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, Charles. ''George Ripley: Transcendentalist and Utopian Socialist''. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1967: 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

She first met [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] during his final year as a student at the [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;Golemba, Henry L. ''George Ripley''. Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1977: 22. {{ISBN|0-8057-7181-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826, they became engaged, though Ripley did not tell his parents right away. He asked his sister Marianne to inform them, assuring them that their relationship was not based on "any romantic or sudden passion" but on "intellectual power, moral worth, deep and true Christian piety, and refinement and dignity of character".&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, Charles. ''George Ripley: Transcendentalist and Utopian Socialist''. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1967: 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; They were officially married on August 22, 1827, in a ceremony presided over by [[Abiel Holmes]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, Charles. ''George Ripley: Transcendentalist and Utopian Socialist''. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1967: 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Ripley became a friend of [[Margaret Fuller]] and was one of the women to attend Fuller's first series of "conversations".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Megan. ''The Peabody Sisters: Three Women Who Ignited American Romanticism''. Boston: Mariner Books, 2005: 386–387. {{ISBN|978-0-618-71169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller explained to Ripley her goals: "It is to pass in review the departments of thought and knowledge, and endeavor to place them in due relation to one another in our mind. To systemize thought and give precision and clearness in which our sex are so deficient, chiefly, I think, because they have so few inducements to test and classify what they receive. To ascertain what pursuits are best suited to us".&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Anne C. ''Transcendentalism as a Social Movement, 1830–1850''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press: 1981: 58–59. {{ISBN|0-300-02587-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ripley was also among the few regular women guests of the male-dominated [[Transcendental Club]] in the 1830s, and she published an essay on women in ''[[The Dial]]''. In July 1841,''The Dial'' published a letter from Ripley called "Letter from Zoar", an account of her experience visiting a communistic society of "Separatists" in [[Zoar, Ohio]] in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;Delano, Sterling F. ''Brook Farm: The Dark Side of Utopia''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2004: 60. {{ISBN|0-674-01160-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s, she co-founded an experimental Utopian community called [[Brook Farm]] along with her husband and was one of the experiment's major supporters in its early years. Along with her sister-in-law Marianne Ripley, she oversaw Brook Farm's primary school using a progressive child-centered [[pedagogy]] that has been compared to the later reforms of [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Felton, R. Todd. ''A Journey into the Transcendentalists' New England''. Berkeley, California: Roaring Forties Press, 2006: 126. {{ISBN|0-9766706-4-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Brook Farm adapted itself into a [[Charles Fourier]]-inspired ''[[phalanstère]]'', she did not share her husband's enthusiasm.&lt;ref name=Packer172&gt;Packer, Barbara L. ''The Transcendentalists''. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2007: 172. {{ISBN|978-0-8203-2958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced in part by [[Orestes Brownson]], she converted to Catholicism in 1846 and became a dedicated member of the church, leading her to eventually become a well-known nun; her husband never converted.&lt;ref name=Packer172/&gt; Their relationship became strained by the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Anne C. ''Transcendentalism as a Social Movement, 1830–1850''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press: 1981: 209. {{ISBN|0-300-02587-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1861.

'''Tenrikyo theology''' (天理教学 ''Tenrikyōgaku'') is the [[theology]] of the [[Tenrikyo]] religion. The discipline of Tenrikyo theology consists of scriptural studies (studies of the ''[[Ofudesaki]],'' ''[[Mikagura-uta]],'' and ''[[Osashizu]]''), [[historical theology]], [[dogmatic theology]], and [[practical theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Tenri University Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion ed., ''Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten'', Tenrikyō Dōyūsha, 1997, p.591–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In historical documents and scriptures related to Tenrikyo, a number of different appellations are ascribed to God.{{sfn|Ellwood|1982|p=81}} 

In the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'', God identified as three different entities. In 1869, when the first verses were composed, God initially identified as ''[[kami]]'' (神), a [[spirit]] in the Japanese [[Shinto]] tradition. The designation ''kami'' was broader than the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] notion of God, as it could be applied to any object that possessed divine power or inspired awe, such as animals, trees, places, and people. However, the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'' stressed the uniqueness of the ''kami'' by adding various qualifiers such as ''moto no kami'' (God ''of origin''), ''shinjitsu no kami'' (God ''of truth''), and ''kono yō o hajimeta kami'' (God ''who began this world''). From 1874, God began to identify as ''tsukihi'' (月日), or moon-sun, and from 1879, God began to identify as ''oya'' (をや), or parent, though ''kami'' and ''tsukihi'' continued to be used until the last part of the scripture.

In Tenrikyo's creation story, outlined in the ''Ofudesaki'' and elaborated upon in various notes on her talks known collectively as ''kōki'', there are ten figures credited with the creation of human beings. Some Tenrikyo authorities suggest that two of these figures, ''Kunitokotachi-no-Mikoto'' and ''Omotari-no-Mikoto'', represent ''tsukihi'', or more precisely the duality ''tsuki-sama'' and ''hi-sama''. The other eight figures are tools subordinate to ''tsukihi'' that were drawn in, consulted, and trained in the creation of human beings.

In the ''[[Mikagura-uta]],'' the songs of Tenrikyo's [[liturgy]], God is commonly referred to as ''[[kami]].'' At the end of most of the songs, God is invoked with the name ''Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto,'' (てんりおうのみこと or 天理王命) or "absolute ruler of divine reason."

The historical sources written during Nakayama Miki's lifetime and in the years following her death suggest a number of other appellations of God. In Nakayama Shinnosuke's ''Oyasama gyoden,'' the source on which ''[[The Life of Oyasama]]'' is primarily based, Miki refers to God as ''ten no shōgun'' ([[Shōgun]] of [[Heaven]]) in the initial revelation. In early attempts to obtain religious sanctions from the Yoshida Administrative Office of Shinto and a Shingon Buddhist temple, the name of God was recorded as ''Tenrin-Ō-Myōjin'' (天輪王明神) and ''Tenrin-Ō-Kōsha'' (転輪王講社) respectively. An early doctrine of the Tenrikyo church, written to conform to the State Shinto doctrine at the time, records the name as ''Tenri-Ōkami''.

Tenrikyo's current doctrine maintains that ''Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto'' is the divine name to be used in the context of prayer.{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1993|p=29}} The doctrine frequently refers to God as God the Parent (親神様 ''oyagamisama''), emphasizing the parental nature of God revealed toward the end of the ''Ofudesaki''.{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1993|p=10}} The doctrine claims that the changes in God's names in the ''Ofudesaki'', from ''kami'' to ''tsukihi'' to ''oya'', were made in accordance with the spiritual growth of the early followers.{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1993|pp=8–10}}

===Attributes=== 
The ''Ofudesaki'' verses name ''jūyō'' or ''jūyōjizai'', translated as "[[omnipotence]]" or "free and unlimited workings," as a significant attribute of God. This omnipotence governs not only the order of the universe, but also events in the natural world, such as rainstorms and earthquakes, and in one's personal life, such as dreams and diseases. This omnipotence works through those people who believe as well as those who do not.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causality===
====Comparison to karmic belief====
{{see also|Karma}}
The concept of "causality" (''innen'' いんねん) in Tenrikyo is a unique understanding of [[karma|karmic belief]]. Though causality resembles karmic beliefs found in religious traditions originating in ancient India, such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], Tenrikyo's doctrine does not claim to inherit the concept from these traditions and differs from their explanations of karma in a few significant ways.

Broadly speaking, karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312474/karma Karma] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a person's good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed contribute to bad karma and future suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence C. Becker &amp; Charlotte B. Becker, Encyclopedia of Ethics, 2nd Edition, {{ISBN|0-415-93672-1}}, Hindu Ethics, pp 678&lt;/ref&gt; Causality and karma are interchangeable in this sense;&lt;ref&gt;Kisala, Robert. "Contemporary Karma: Interpretations of Karma in Tenrikyō and Risshō Kōseikai." Japanese Journal of Religious Studies, Vol. 21, No. 1 (Mar., 1994), pp. 73-91: "In accord with traditional karmic understanding, it is the accumulation of bad innen that is offered as the explanation for present suffering."&lt;/ref&gt; throughout life a person may experience good and bad causality. In Tenrikyo, the concept is encapsulated in the farming metaphor, "every seed sown will sprout."&lt;ref&gt;Fukaya, Yoshikazu. "Every Seed Sown Will Sprout." ''Words of the Path.'' [http://www.tenrikyo.or.jp/en/newsletter/html/tt5/innen.html online link]&lt;/ref&gt; Karma is closely associated with the idea of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]],&lt;ref name=jamesloch&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp 351-352&lt;/ref&gt; such that one's past deeds in the current life and in all previous lives are reflected in the present moment, and one's present deeds are reflected in the future of the current life and in all future lives.&lt;ref name=jbowker&gt;"Karma" in: John Bowker (1997), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of rebirth is upheld in causality as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kisala, p.77. "...traditional karmic beliefs in personal responsibility, extending over innumerable lifetimes, are upheld in doctrines concerning individual innen."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tenrikyo's [[ontology]], however, differs from older karmic religious traditions such as Buddhism. In Tenrikyo, the human person is believed to consist of [[mind]], [[Human body|body]], and [[soul]]. The mind, which is given the freedom to sense, feel, and act by God the Parent, ceases to function at death. On the other hand, the soul, through the process of ''denaoshi'' (出直し, "to make a fresh start"), takes on a new body lent from God the Parent and is reborn into this world. Thought the reborn person has no memory of the previous life, the person's thoughts and deeds leave their mark on the soul and are carried over into the new life as the person's causality.&lt;ref&gt;Kisala, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; As can be seen, Tenrikyo's ontology, which rests on the existence on a single creator deity (God the Parent), differs from Buddhist ontology, which does not contain a creator deity. Also Tenrikyo's concept of salvation, which is to live the Joyous Life in this existence and therefore does not promise a liberated afterlife outside of this existence, differs from Buddhist concepts of [[saṃsāra]] and [[nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue'', p. 429-430.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Original causality====
At the focal point of Tenrikyo's ontological understanding is the positing of ''original causality'', or ''causality of origin'' (''moto no innen'' もとのいんねん), which is that God the Parent created human beings to see them live the Joyous Life (the salvific state) and to share in that joy. Tenrikyo teaches that the Joyous Life will eventually encompass all humanity, and that gradual progress towards the Joyous Life is even now being made with the guidance of divine providence. Thus the concept of original causality has a [[teleological]] element, being the gradual unfolding of that which was ordained at the beginning of time.&lt;ref&gt;Kisala, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual causality====
Belief in ''individual causality'' is related to the principle of original causality. Individual causality is divine providence acting to realize the original causality of the human race, which through the use of suffering guides individuals to realize their causality and leads them to a change of heart and active cooperation towards the establishment of the Joyous Life, the world that was ordained at the beginning of time.&lt;ref&gt;Kisala, p.77-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenrikyo's doctrine explains that an individual's suffering should not be perceived as punishment or [[retributive justice]] from divine providence for past misdeeds, but rather as an sign of encouragement from divine providence for the individual to reflect on the past and to undergo a change of heart. The recognition of the divine providence at work should lead to an attitude of ''tanno'' (たんのう "joyous acceptance" in Tenrikyo gloss), a Japanese word that indicates a state of satisfaction. ''Tanno'' is a way of settling the mind – it is not to merely resign oneself to one’s situation, but rather to actively “recognize God’s parental love in all events and be braced by their occurrence into an ever firmer determination to live joyously each day.”&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine of Tenrikyo, Tenrikyo Church HQ, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Tenrikyo emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive inner disposition, as opposed to a disposition easily swayed by external circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;Kisala, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Three causalities====
In addition, ''The Doctrine of Tenrikyo'' names ''three causalities'' (''san innen'' さんいんねん) that are believed to predetermine the founding of Tenrikyo's teachings. More precisely, these causalities are the fulfillment of the promise that God made to the models and instruments of creation, which was that "when the years equal to the number of their first born had elapsed, they would be returned to the Residence of Origin, the place of original conception, and would be adored by their posterity."&lt;ref&gt;''The Doctrine of Tenrikyo'', p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Causality of the Soul of Oyasama" denotes that Miki Nakayama had the soul of the original mother at creation (''Izanami-no-Mikoto''), who conceived, gave birth to, and nurtured humankind. The "Causality of the Residence" means that the Nakayama Residence, where [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]] stands, is the place that humankind was conceived. The "Causality of the Promised Time" indicates that October 26, 1838 – the day when God became openly revealed through Miki Nakayama – marked the time when the years equal to the number of first-born humans (900,099,999) had elapsed since the moment humankind was conceived.&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms,'' p.436.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation narrative==
{{Main article|Tenrikyo creation narrative}}
The creation narrative of Tenrikyo, which followers refer to as the "Truth of Origin" (元の理 ''moto no ri''), explains Nakayama Miki's understanding of how God created the first prototypes of human beings and developed them over many years.

The creation narrative first appeared in writing in 1874, when Nakayama Miki composed Part III of the ''Ofudesaki''. The narrative was described in more detail in Part VI and continued to be explained in fragments in the parts thereafter.{{sfn|Matsumura|1998|p=363}}

However, Miki also conveyed the narrative as part of talks she would deliver to her disciples regarding her teachings. She had her disciples write down what they remembered of her talks and submit them to her for her approval. In the end she never approved any of the manuscripts, so her followers did not regard them as [[Biblical canon|canonical]] in the same way as the scriptures – namely the ''Ofudesaki'', ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'', and ''[[Osashizu]]''. The manuscripts that have survived are collectively referred to as ''kōki'' (こふき).{{sfn|Matsumura|1998|pp=360–2}}

In the latter half of the twentieth century, scholars began to publish interpretations of the creation narrative based on various disciplines such as [[ethnology]], [[cosmology]], [[philosophy]], [[comparative mythology]], [[psychology]], and [[biology]].{{sfn|Inoue|1998|p=338}}

==History==
A year after the death of Tenrikyo founder [[Nakayama Miki]] in 1887, [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]] was established as a legally recognized religious organization under the Shinto Main Bureau (神道本局 ''Shinto Honkyoku'').&lt;ref&gt;Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department. ''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo.'' Translation of ''Oyasama Nensai to Tomoni.'' Tenri, 1990. p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, Tenrikyo founded its first institute for doctrinal studies, Tenri Seminary. In 1903, an early edition of Tenrikyo's doctrine was completed, known today as the "Meiji doctrine" since it was written during the [[Meiji period]]. This edition of the doctrine differed significantly from the present edition&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the ''Meiji kyoten'' contained ten chapters: 'Revering God,' 'Respecting the Emperor,' 'Loving the Nation,' 'Morality,' 'Accumulating Virtues,' 'Cleansing of Impurities,' 'Founding of the Teachings,' 'Repayment to God,' 'the Kagura', and 'Peace of Mind.' See ''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness,'' p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; because the scholars who completed this edition were not strictly Tenrikyo scholars but scholars of religion (Nakanishi Ushirō) and scholars of Shinto (Inoue Yorikuni, Itsumi Chūzaburō) invited from outside the Tenrikyo circle.&lt;ref&gt;Shimada, K. (2014). The Emergence and Development of Tenrikyo Theology. ''Tenri Journal of Religion, 42,'' 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, [[Nakayama Shozen]], Nakayama Miki's great-grandson, became the second [[Shinbashira]] (spiritual and administrative leader) of Tenrikyo Church Headquarters and founded the Department of Doctrine and Historical Materials. From 1925 to 1938, the Department of Doctrine and Historical Materials began to compile the sources which would form the basis of Tenrikyo's scriptures and supplements to the scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 42,'' 112.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During this period, several Tenrikyo students attended university and majored in religious studies. These would become some of Tenrikyo's first theologians. One such student was Nakayama Shozen, who from 1926–1929 studied the history of religion at [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]] under [[Anesaki Masaharu|Masaharu Anesaki]]. In the following decade, others would major in religious studies at Tokyo Imperial University, such as Ueda Yoshinaru (1931), Nakayama Yoshikazu (1932), Nagao Hiroumi (1935), and Moroi Yoshinori (1938). Fukaya Tadamasa was studying [[History of Western civilization|Western history]], with a focus on history of [[Christian theology]], at [[Kyoto University|Kyoto Imperial University]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 42,'' 112–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the several years following [[World War II]], further research and institutional development allowed for the emergence of Tenrikyo theology. In 1946, the Department of Doctrine and Historical Materials began to publish its findings in the periodical ''Fukugen'' ('Restoration'). ''[[The Doctrine of Tenrikyo]],'' which systematically summarizes Tenrikyo's beliefs and practices, was published in 1949. In the same year, [[Tenri University]] was founded.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 42,'' 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenrikyo theology as a collective academic effort began with the first issue of ''Tenrikyōgaku kenkyū'' (Studies on Tenrikyo theology) published in 1950. This issue opened with an essay by Moroi Yoshinori titled ''Tenrikyō shingaku joshō'' (Introduction to Tenrikyo theology), which outlines what he believed to be the contents and the goals of Tenrikyo theology.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 42,'' 107–110, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Christian theology and [[existentialism]] have had a significant influence in the early development of Tenrikyo theology. Early Tenrikyo scholars expressed interest in the thought of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Jaspers]], and [[Gabriel Marcel]],&lt;ref&gt;van Straelen, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and recommended that their students study [[Karl Barth]]'s ''[[Church Dogmatics]].''&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 42,'' 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theologians==
===Moroi Yoshinori===
Moroi Yoshinori (諸井慶徳 1915–1961)&lt;ref&gt;Sawai, Y. (2014). The Overview and Significance of the Symposium. ''Tenri Journal of Religion, 42,'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt; first studied [[philosophy of religion]] at Tokyo Imperial University, writing his undergraduate thesis on [[Max Scheler]].&lt;ref&gt;Moroi, K. (2014). Recollections of My Father. ''Tenri Journal of Religion, 42,'' 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Moroi did his doctoral work at the same university, receiving his Doctor of Literature degree from the University of Tokyo in 1961, the day before he died.&lt;ref&gt;Wakamatsu, E. (2014). ''Toshihiko Izutsu and the Philosophy of WORD: In Search of the Spiritual Orient'' (J. C. Hoff, Trans.). Tokyo, Japan: International House of Japan. (Original work published 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most notable works of academic research is his doctoral dissertation, ''Shūkyō shinpishugi hassei no kenkyū: toku ni Semu-kei chōetsushinkyō o chūshin to suru shūkyō gakuteki kōsatsu'' ("A study of the development of religious mysticism: A religious-studies perspective centering on Semitic monotheism"), which was posthumously published by [[Tenri University]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Wakamatsu, 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable work, ''Shūkyōteki shutaisei no ronri'' ("The logic of religious identity"), was left unfinished at his death, but it was completed by younger Tenrikyo scholars and eventually published in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Wakamatsu, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his works pertaining to Tenrikyo theology are the aforementioned ''Tenrikyō shingaku joshō'' and ''Tenrikyō kyōgigaku shiron'' ("A preliminary essay on Tenrikyo dogmatic theology"). Many of his works were compiled and published in ''Moroi Yoshinori chōsakushū'' ("Collection of Yoshinori Moroi's Works").

===Fukaya Tadamasa===
Fukaya Tadamasa (深谷忠政 1912–2007) studied the history of Christian theology at Kyoto Imperial University. Throughout his life he held important positions in Tenrikyo Church Headquarters, serving at various points as president of [[Tenrikyo Doyusha]], professor at [[Tenri University]], bishop of Tenrikyo's diocese in North America, and ''honbu-in'' (Church Headquarters executive staff member).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tenrikyo.or.jp/en/newsletter/html/200704/fukaya.html "Tadamasa Fukaya Passes Away for Rebirth"] from TENRIKYO (Monthly Newsletter), April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

His important theological works include ''Tenrikyō – dame no oshie'' ("Tenrikyo – the ultimate teaching") and ''Tenrikyō kyōgigaku josetsu'' ("Prolegomena to Tenrikyo dogmatics").&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 42,'' 124–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote a number of books which have since been translated into English by the Tenrikyo Overseas Department, such as a ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'' commentary (''A Commentary on the Mikagura-uta'') and a study on [[Tenrikyo creation narrative|Tenrikyo's creation narrative]] (''A Doctrinal Study: The Truth of Origin'').

===Other theologians===
Tenrikyo theologians have focused on subfields of study within Tenrikyo theology. Scriptural studies is based on contributions of Nakayama Shozen, Moroi Yoshinori, and Fukaya Tadamasa, and more recent contributors to this subfield include Nakajima Hideo, Yamamoto Kunio, Serizawa Shigeru, and Sawai Yuichi. Research on Tenrikyo's relationship to contemporary thought has been done by Iida Teruaki. Research on Tenrikyo [[missiology]] has been conducted by Shionoya Satoshi. Historical research on Tenrikyo has been contributed by Ishizaki Masao and Ihashi Fusato. Connections between Tenrikyo and religious studies have been researched by Matsunoto Shigeru, Miyata Gen, and Hashimoto Taketo.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 42,'' 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}

In [[religion]], '''transcendence''' refers to the aspect of a [[deity]]'s nature and power that is wholly independent of the material [[universe]], beyond all known [[physical law]]s. This is contrasted [[immanence]], where a god is said to be fully present in the physical world and thus accessible to creatures in various ways. In [[religious experience]] transcendence is a state of being that has overcome the limitations of physical existence and by some definitions has also become independent of it. This is typically manifested in  [[prayer]], [[séance]], [[meditation]], [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]s and [[paranormal]] "visions".

It is affirmed in various religious traditions' concept of the [[divinity|divine]], which contrasts with the notion of a [[god]] (or, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]) that exists exclusively in the physical order ([[immanence|immanentism]]), or indistinguishable from it ([[pantheism]]). Transcendence can be attributed to the divine not only in its being, but also in its knowledge. Thus, a god may transcend both the universe and knowledge (is beyond the grasp of the human mind).

Although transcendence is defined as the opposite of [[immanence]], the two are not necessarily [[mutually exclusive]]. Some [[theology|theologians]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysicians]] of various religious traditions affirm that a god is both within and beyond the universe ([[panentheism]]); in it, but not of it; simultaneously pervading it and surpassing it.

==View by religion==
===Bahá'í Faith===
[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] believe in a [[Monotheism|single]], imperishable [[god]], the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite book | year = 1988 | title = The Bahá'í Faith | encyclopedia = Britannica Book of the Year | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | location = Chicago | isbn = 0-85229-486-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Bahá'í tradition, god is described as "a personal god, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA
 |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-9.html#gr26 | page= 139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of his creation, with a mind, will and purpose.  Bahá'ís believe that God expresses this will at all times and in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]] or sometimes ''divine educators''.&lt;ref name="eor"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
| last = [[Manfred Hutter|Hutter]] | first = Manfred | editor = Ed. Lindsay Jones | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion | title = Bahā'īs | edition = 2nd | year = 2005 | publisher = Macmillan Reference USA | volume = 2 | location = Detroit | isbn = 0-02-865733-0 | pages = 737–740}}&lt;/ref&gt; In expressing God's intent, these manifestations are seen to establish religion in the world.  Bahá'í teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, nor to create a complete and accurate image.&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9  | pages =1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
In [[Buddhism]] "transcendence", by definition, belongs to the mortal beings of the [[Buddhist cosmology#Formless Realm (Ārūpyadhātu)|formless realms]] of existence. However, although such beings are at 'the peak' of [[Samsara]], Buddhism considers the development of transcendence to be both temporary and a spiritual cul-de-sac, which therefore does not eventuate a permanent cessation of Samsara. This assertion was a primary differentiator from the other [[Sramana]] teachers during [[Gautama Buddha]]'s own training and development.&lt;ref&gt;Ariyapariyesana Sutta - "'This Dhamma (of Alara Kalama) leads not to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to Awakening, nor to Unbinding, but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness (one of the four states of formlessness).'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, in the various forms of Buddhism—Theravada, Mahayana (especially Pure Land and Zen) and Vajrayana—the notion of transcendence sometimes includes a [[soteriological]] application. Except for Pure Land and Vajrayana, the role played by transcendent beings is minimal and at most a temporary expedient. However some Buddhists believe that [[Nirvana]] is an eternal, transcendental state beyond name and form, so for these Buddhists, Nirvana is the main concept of transcendence. The more usual interpretation of Nirvana in Buddhism is that it is a cessation—a permanent absence of something (namely suffering), and therefore it is not in any way a state which could be considered transcendent.

Primordial enlightenment and the dharma are sometimes portrayed as transcendent, since they can surpass all samsaric obstructions.

===Christianity===
{{Attributes of God}}
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}
The Catholic Church, as do other Christian Churches, holds that God transcends all creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#35/z Catechism of the Catholic Church §§42, 212]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]], "...concerning God, we cannot grasp what he is, but only what he is not, and how other beings stand in relation to him."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, Thomas. SCG I, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropomorphic depictions of God are largely metaphorical and reflect the challenge of "human modes of expression" in attempting to describe the infinite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#35/z CCC §43]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] observed "...[I]t is only by the use of such human expressions that Scripture can make its many kinds of readers whom it wants to help to feel, as it were, at home."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', 15, 25&lt;/ref&gt; The "sense of transcendence" and therefore, an awareness of the "sacred", is an important component of the liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lincolndiocese.org/op-ed/bcwriting/102-reflecting-on-transcendence-in-the-liturgy-the-new-translation-of-the-mass-and-what-will-it-mean-for-us Conley, James D., "Reflecting on Transcendence in the Liturgy", ''southern Nebraska Register'']&lt;/ref&gt; God is recognized as both transcendent and [[Immanence|immanent]].

===Hinduism===
Transcendence is described and viewed from a number of diverse perspectives in [[Hinduism]]. Some traditions, such as [[Advaita Vedanta]], view transcendence in the form of God as the [[Nirguna Brahman]] (God without attributes), transcendence being absolute. Other traditions, such as [[Bhakti yoga]], view transcendence as God with attributes ([[Saguna Brahman]]), the Absolute being a personal deity ([[Ishvara]]), such as [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]].

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]] transcendence is described as a level of spiritual attainment, or state of being which is open to all spiritual aspirants (the goal of [[yoga]] practice), the state at which one is no longer under the control of animalistic, base desires and is aware of a higher spiritual reality.
{{quote|When the [[yogi|yogī]], by practice of yoga, disciplines his mental activities and becomes situated in transcendence — devoid of all material desires — he is said to be well established in yoga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/6/18/en1 BG 6.18] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130118000234/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/6/18/en1 |date=18 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The exact nature of this transcendence is given as being "above the modes of material nature", which are known as ''[[gunas]]'' (ropes) which bind the living entity to the world of ''[[samsara]]'' (repeated rebirth) in Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhagavadgitaasitis.com/14/22-25/en1 BG 14.22-25] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303001808/http://www.bhagavadgitaasitis.com/14/22-25/en1 |date=3 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|Tawhid|Tanzih}}
''Tawhid'' is the act of believing and affirming that [[God]] (Arabic: [[Allah]]) is one and unique (''wāḥid''). The Qur'an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the entire creation.&lt;ref name="EncRel"&gt;Vincent J. Cornell, Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol 5, pp.3561-3562&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Qur'an:&lt;ref name="EncRel"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Say: He is God, the One and Only;  God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him." (Sura {{cite quran|112|1-4|style=nosup|expand=no}}, ''Yusuf Ali'') &lt;br&gt;Thy Lord is self-sufficient, full of Mercy: if it were God's will, God could destroy you, and in your place appoint whom God will as your successors, even as God raised you up from the posterity of other people." (Sura {{cite quran|6|133|style=nosup|expand=no}}, ''Yusuf Ali'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Vincent J. Cornell, the Qur'an also provides a [[monism|monist]] image of God by describing the reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things:"God is the First and the Last, the Outward and the Inward; God is the Knower of everything (Sura {{cite quran|57|3|style=nosup|expand=no}})"&lt;ref name="EncRel"/&gt; All Muslims have however vigorously criticized interpretations that would lead to a monist view of God for what they see as blurring the distinction between the creator and the creature, and its incompatibility with the radical monotheism of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Gottlie (2006), p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to explain the complexity of unity of God and of the divine nature, the Qur'an uses 99 terms referred to as "Most Beautiful Names of Allah" (Sura 77:180)[12]. Aside from the supreme name "Allah" and the neologism al-Rahman (referring to the divine beneficence that constantly  (re)creates, maintains and destroys the universe), other names may be shared by both God and human beings. According to the Islamic teachings, the latter is meant to serve as a reminder of God's [[immanence]] rather than being a sign of one's divinity or alternatively imposing a limitation on God's transcendent nature.

Tawhid or Oneness of God constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession.&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;D. Gimaret, ''Tawhid'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; To attribute divinity to a created entity is the only unpardonable sin mentioned in the Qur'an.&lt;ref name="Barlas96"&gt;Asma Barlas (2003-2007) Believing Women in Islam. University of Texas Press, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawhid.&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Ramadan (2005), p.203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
[[Jewish]] theologians, especially since the [[Middle Ages]], have described the transcendence of God in terms of [[divine simplicity]], explaining the traditional characteristics of God as [[omniscient]] and [[omnipotent]].  Interventions of divine transcendence occur in the form of events outside the realm of natural occurrence such as [[miracle]]s and the [[revelation]] of the [[Ten Commandments]] to [[Moses]] at [[Mt. Sinai]].

In Jewish [[Kabbalistic]] [[cosmology]], God is described as the "[[Ein Sof]]" (literally, without end) as reference to God's divine simplicity and essential unknowability. The emanation of creation from the Ein Sof is explained through a process of filtering. In the Kabbalistic [[creation myth]] referred to as the "breaking of the vessels," filtering was necessary because otherwise this intense, simple essence would have overwhelmed and made impossible the emergence of any distinct creations. Each filter, described as a vessel, captured the emanation of this creative force until it was overwhelmed and broken by the intensity of God's simple essence. Once broken, the vessel's shards, full of absorbed "divine sparks," fell into a vessel below. This process ultimately continued until the "light" of Godliness was sufficiently reduced to allow the world we inhabit to be sustained without breaking. The creation of this world, however, comes with the consequence that Godly transcendence is hidden, or "exiled" (from the immanent world). Only through the revelation of sparks hidden within the shards embedded in our material world can this transcendence be recognized again. In [[Hasidic]] thought, divine sparks are revealed through the performance of commandments or "[[mitzvot]]," (literally, the obligations and prohibitions described in the [[Torah]]). A Kabbalistic explanation for the existence of malevolence in the world is that such terrible things are possible with the divine sparks being hidden. Thus there is some urgency to performing mitzvot in order to liberate the hidden sparks and perform a "[[tikkun olam]]" (literally, healing of the world). Until then, the world is presided over by the immanent aspect of God, often referred to as the [[Shekhinah]] or divine spirit, and in feminine terms.

===Sikhism===
'''[[Waheguru]]''' ({{lang-pa|ਵਾਹਿਗੁਰੂ}}, ''{{IAST|Vāhigurū}}'') is a term most often used in [[Sikhism]] to refer to [[God]], the [[Supreme Being]] or the creator of all. It means "Wonderful Teacher" in the Punjabi language, but in this case is used to refer to the Sikh God. ''Wahi'' means "wonderful" (a Middle Persian borrowing) and "[[Guru]]" ({{lang-sa|गुरु}}) is a term denoting "teacher". Waheguru is also described by some{{According to whom|date=August 2014}} as an experience of ecstasy which is beyond all descriptions.

Cumulatively, the name implies wonder at the Divine Light eliminating spiritual darkness. It might also imply, "Hail the Lord whose name eliminates spiritual darkness." Earlier, [[Shaheed Bhai Mani Singh]], ''Sikhan di Bhagat Mala'', gave a similar explication, also on the authority of [[Guru Nanak]]. Considering the two constituents of "Vahiguru" ("vahi" + "guru") implying the state of wondrous ecstasy and offering of homage to the Lord, the first one was brought distinctly and prominently into the devotional system by Guru Nanak, who has made use of this interjection, as in [[Majh ki Var]] (stanza 24), and [[Suhi ki Var]], [[sloka meter|sloka]] to [[pauri]] 10.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Sikh doctrine identifies one panentheistic god (Ek Onkar) who is omnipresent and has infinite qualities, whose name is true (Satnam), can do anything (Karta purkh), has no fear (Nirb  hau), is not the enemy of anyone (Nirvair), is beyond time (Akaal), has no image (Murat), is beyond birth and death circulation (Ajunee), is self-existent (Sai Bhang) and possesses the grace of word guru (eternal light) we can meet him (Gurprasaad). Sikhs do not identify a gender for Ek Onkar, nor do they believe it takes a human form. In the Sikh tradition, all human beings are considered equal regardless of their religion, sex, or race. All are sons and daughters of Waheguru, the Almighty.&lt;ref name="Heartbeat"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ek-Onkar-Satnam-Heartbeat-Nanak/dp/1477214267/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384679886&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Ek+Onkar+Satnam%3A+The+Heartbeat+of+Nanak | title=Ek Onkar Satnam: The Heartbeat of Nanak | publisher=AuthorHouseUK | author=Taoshobuddha | date=22 Aug 2012 |page=438 | isbn=1-4772-1426-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "death of God" and the end of transcendence in secular culture==
{{See also|God is dead|Richard L. Rubenstein}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
In 1961, Christian theologian [[Gabriel Vahanian]]'s published ''The Death of God''. Vahanian argued that modern secular culture had lost all sense of the sacred, lacking any sacramental meaning, no transcendental purpose or sense of providence. He concluded that for the modern secular mind "God is dead", but he did not mean that God did not exist. In Vahanian's vision a transformed post-Christian and post-modern culture was needed to create a renewed experience of deity.

Paul Van Buren and William Hamilton both agreed that the concept of transcendence had lost any meaningful place in modern secular thought. According to the norms of contemporary modern secular thought, God is dead. In responding to this denial of transcendence Van Buren and Hamilton offered secular people the option of Jesus as the model human who acted in love. The encounter with the Christ of faith would be open in a church-community.

[[Thomas J. J. Altizer]] offered a radical theology of the death of God that drew upon [[William Blake]], Hegelian thought and Nietzschean ideas. He conceived of theology as a form of poetry in which the immanence (presence) of God could be encountered in faith communities. However, he no longer accepted the possibility of affirming his belief in a transcendent God. Altizer concluded that God had incarnated in Christ and imparted his immanent spirit which remained in the world even though Jesus was dead. It is important that such ideas are understood as socio-cultural developments and not as ontological realities. As Vahanian expressed it in his book, the issue of the denial of God lies in the mind of secular man, not in reality.

Critiquing the death of God theology, Joseph Papin, the founder of the Villanova Theology Institute, noted: "Rumbles of the new theology of the 'Requiem for God," (theologians of the death of God) proved to be a totally inadequate foundation for spanning a theological river with a bridge.  The school of the theology of the "Requiem of God," not even implementing a "Requiem for Satan," will constitute only a footnote to the history of theology. . . . 'The Grave of God,' was the death rattle for the continuancy of the aforementioned school without any noticeable echo." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Post-Conciliar Perspectives," The Dynamic in Christian Thought|last=Papin|first=Joseph|publisher=Villanova University Press|year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Piet Schoonenberg (Nijmegen, Netherlands) directly critiqued Altizer concluding: "Rightly understood the transcendence of God does not exclude His immanence, but includes it." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="The Transcendence of God, Part I," Transcendence and Immanence, Reconstruction in the Light of Process Thinking, Festschrift in Honor of Joseph Papin, ed.

This however occurs when God's transcendence is expressed as elevated over the world to the exclusion of his presence in this world; when his independence is expressed by excluding his real relation and reaction to the world; or when we insist upon his unchangeable eternity to the exclusion of his real partnership in human history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="From Transcendence to Immanence, Part II," Wisdom and Knowledge, Essays in Honor of Joseph Papin, ed.

'''U Nārada''' ({{lang-my|နာရဒ}}; 1868–1955),&lt;ref name=Sharf&gt;Robert H. Sharf, ''Buddhist Modernism and the Rhetoric of Meditative Experience,'' Numen 42 (1995) pg 242&lt;/ref&gt; also '''Mingun Jetawun Sayādaw''' or '''Mingun Jetavana Sayādaw''', was a [[Burma|Burmese]] monk in the [[Theravada]] tradition credited with being one of the key figures in the revival of [[Vipassana]] meditation.&lt;ref name=Sharf/&gt;

His prominent students, particularly [[Mahasi Sayadaw]], helped popularize what is now known as the "New Burmese Method" or the "Mahasi method."&lt;ref name=Sharf/&gt; ''Sayadaw'' is a Burmese term of respect when addressing major Buddhist monks and means "great master".

==Creation of the New Burmese method==
[[Nyanaponika Thera]], himself a student of Mahasi Sayadaw, describes the manner in which U Nārada developed the New Burmese Method:
{{quote|It was at the beginning of this century that a Burmese monk, U Nārada by name, bent on actual realization of the teachings he had learnt, was eagerly searching for a system of meditation offering a direct access to the Highest Goal, without encumbrance by accessories. Wandering through the country, he met many who were given to strict meditative practice, but he could not obtain guidance satisfactory to him. In the course of his quest, coming to the famous meditation-caves in the hills of Sagaing in Upper Burma, he met a monk who was reputed to have entered upon those lofty Paths of Sanctitude (''ariya-magga'') where the final achievement of Liberation is assured. When the Venerable U Nārada put his question to him, he was asked in return: 'Why are you searching outside of the Master's word? Has not the Only Way, ''[[Satipaṭṭhāna]]'', been proclaimed by Him?'&lt;br&gt;

U Nārada took up this indication. Studying again the text and its traditional exposition, reflecting deeply on it, and entering energetically upon its practice, he finally came to understand its salient features. The results achieved in his own practice convinced him that he had found what he was searching for: a clear-cut and effective method of training the mind for highest realization. From his own experience he developed the principles and the details of the practice which formed the basis for those who followed him as his direct or indirect disciples. In order to give a name to the Venerable U Narada's method of training in which the principles of ''Sattipatṭṭhāna'' are applied in such a definite and radical way, we propose to call it here the Burmese Sattipatṭṭhāna Method; not in the sense that it was a Burmese invention but because it was in Burma that the practice of that ancient Way had been so ably and energetically revived.&lt;ref&gt;''The Heart of Buddhist Meditation: Satipaṭṭhāna: a handbook of mental training based on the Buddha's way of mindfulness, with an anthology of relevant texts translated from the Pali and Sanskrit'' by Nyanaponika (Thera). Buddhist Publication Society, 1992 pg 95–96&lt;sup&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UaIuXnKzCrUC]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thousand-Armed '''Ushnishasitatapattra''' is a special form of the goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)]], a female form of the thousand-armed [[Avalokiteshvara]]. Her iconography is probably the most complex in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] pantheon. The goddess has as many heads and legs as she has arms. She tramples on both human beings and animals.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia"&gt;[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. [http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/58470.html Ushnishasitatapattra, She Who Shelters with the White Parasol]. Retrieved on August 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressed under her feet, they symbolize [[egocentric]] existence, while the function of her umbrella is to protect all beings from all fears.

Ushnishasitatapattra is a powerful independent [[deity]]. She manifests this power with her thousand faces,&lt;ref name="Philadelphia" /&gt; thousand arms and thousand legs. Each face has three eyes, and the palm and wrist of each hand has its own eyes. In this detailed painting she displays them all in multiple rows, including a tall stack of heads in four different colors. Her impressive and awesome appearance is bolstered by her vigorous posture, emphasized by her wide billowing [[Brocade (fabric)|brocaded]] tent-like skirts and long, twisting, green scarves. Her slightly fierce mien does not outweigh the expressions of her lovely and benign nature - the beauty of her form, her white color, and the refinement of her small round face and tiny, idealized features.

Ushnishasitatapattra is popular with the [[Geluk]] order in particular. She is often given a prominent position among the wall paintings in [[Gelukpa]] monasteries, such as [[Drepung]] in [[Lhasa]].

'''Étienne Bonnot de Condillac''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|t|i|ˌ|ɛ|n|_|ˈ|b|ɒ|n|oʊ|_|d|ə|_|ˈ|k|ɒ|n|d|i|ˌ|æ|k}}; {{IPA-fr|bɔno də kɔ̃dijak|lang}}; 30 September 1714&lt;ref&gt;http://data.bnf.fr/11897507/etienne_bonnot_de_condillac/&lt;/ref&gt; – 3 August 1780) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[epistemologist]], who studied in such areas as [[psychology]] and the [[Philosophy of mind|philosophy of the mind]].

==Biography==
He was born at [[Grenoble]] into a legal family, the youngest of three brothers. His two older brothers Jean and Gabriel took names associated with one of the family's properties at [[Mably, Loire]], and were each known as "Bonnot de Mably". Étienne identified with another property at [[Condillac, Drôme]], was known as "Bonnot de Condillac".  Like his brother Gabriel, Condillac took holy orders (1733–1740) at [[Saint-Sulpice church]] in Paris. He was appointed as Abbot of Mureau.
[[File:Condillac, 13 Grand Rue - Grenoble.JPG|thumb|250px|Birthplace of de Condillac in ''13 Grande Rue à Grenoble'']]

Condillac devoted his whole life, with the exception of an interval as a court-appointed tutor to the [[Duchy of Parma|court of Parma]], to speculative thought. His works are:

* ''{{lang|fr|Essai sur l'origine des connaissances humaines}}'' (1746); 
* ''{{lang|fr|Traité des systèmes}}'' (1749); 
* ''{{lang|fr|Traité des sensations}}'' (1754); 
*''{{lang|fr|Traité des animaux}}'' (1755); 
* a comprehensive ''Cours d'études'' (1767–1773) in 13 vols., written for the young [[Duke Ferdinand of Parma]], a grandson of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]; 
* ''{{lang|fr|Le Commerce et le gouvernement, considérés relativement l'un a l'autre}}'' (1776); and two posthumous works, 
* ''{{lang|fr|Logique}}'' (1781) and the unfinished ''{{lang|fr|Langue des calculs}}'' (1798).

In [[Paris]] Condillac was involved with the circle of [[Denis Diderot]], the philosopher who was co-contributor to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. He developed a friendship with [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], which lasted in some measure to the end of his life. It likely started when Rousseau was a tutor to two of his brother Jean's sons in [[Lyon]]. (Jean Bonnot de Mably was then provost of the police and known as Monsieur de Mably.) Together with his brother Gabriel, who became the well-known political writer known as [[Abbé de Mably]], Condillac introduced Rousseau to an intellectual circle.

Condillac's relations with unorthodox philosophers did not injure his career. He had already published several works when the French court sent him to [[Parma]] to educate the orphan duke, then a child of seven years.

In 1768, on his return from Italy, Condillac was elected to the [[Académie française]]. Contrary to the popular idea that he attended only one meeting, he was a frequent attendee until two years before his death. He spent his later years in retirement at Flux, a small property which he had purchased near [[Beaugency]] on the [[Loire River]]. He died there on 3 August 1780.

==Work==
Condillac is important both as a [[psychologist]] and as having established systematically in France the principles of [[John Locke]]. [[Voltaire]] had made the English philosopher fashionable. Condillac developed his concept of empirical sensationism, and demonstrated "lucidity, brevity, moderation, and an earnest striving after logical method."{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

His first book, the ''Essai sur l'origine des connaissances humaines'', keeps close to his English master. He accepts with some reluctance Locke's deduction of our knowledge from two sources, sensation and reflection. He uses as his main principle of explanation the association of ideas.

His next book, the ''Traité des systèmes'', is a vigorous criticism of those modern systems which are based upon abstract principles or upon unsound hypotheses. His polemic, which is inspired throughout by Locke, is directed against the innate ideas of the [[René Descartes|Cartesians]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]]'s faculty-psychology, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[monadism]] and pre-established harmony, and, above all, against the conception of substance set forth in the first part of the ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' of [[Baruch Spinoza]].

By far the most important of his works is the ''Traité des sensations'', in which Condillac treats psychology in his own characteristic way. He questioned Locke's doctrine that the senses give us intuitive knowledge of objects, that the eye, for example, naturally judges shapes, sizes, positions, and distances. He believed it was necessary to study the senses separately, to distinguish precisely what ideas are owed to each sense, to observe how the senses are trained, and how one sense aids another. He believed that the conclusion has to be that all human faculty and knowledge are transformed sensation only, to the exclusion of any other principle, such as reflection.

The author imagines a statue organized inwardly like a man, animated by a soul which has never received an idea, into which no sense-impression has ever penetrated. He unlocks its senses one by one, beginning with smell, as the sense that contributes least to human knowledge. At its first experience of smell, the consciousness of the statue is entirely occupied by it; and this occupancy of consciousness is attention. The statue's smell-experience will produce pleasure or pain; and pleasure and pain will thenceforward be the master-principle which, determining all the operations of its mind, will raise it by degrees to all the knowledge of which it is capable. The next stage is memory, which is the lingering impression of the smell experience upon the attention: "memory is nothing more than a mode of feeling." From memory springs comparison: the statue experiences the smell, say, of a rose, while remembering that of a carnation; and "comparison is nothing more than giving one's attention to two things simultaneously." And "as soon as the statue has comparison it has judgment." Comparisons and judgments become habitual, are stored in the mind and formed into series, and thus arises the powerful principle of the association of ideas. From comparison of past and present experiences in respect of their pleasure-giving quality arises desire; it is desire that determines the operation of our faculties, stimulates the memory and imagination, and gives rise to the passions. The passions, also, are nothing but sensation transformed.

These indications will suffice to show the general course of the argument in the first section of the ''Traité des sensations''. He thoroughly developed this idea through the subsequent chapters: "Of the Ideas of a Man limited to the Sense of Smell," "Of a Man limited to the Sense of Hearing," "Of Smell and Hearing combined," "Of Taste by itself, and of Taste combined with Smell and Hearing," "Of a Man limited to the Sense of Sight."

In the second section of the treatise, Condillac invests his statue with the sense of touch, which first informs it of the existence of external objects. In a very careful and elaborate analysis, he distinguishes the various elements in our tactile experiences-the touching of one's own body, the touching of objects other than one's own body, the experience of movement, the exploration of surfaces by the hands: he traces the growth of the statue's perceptions of extension, distance and shape. The third section deals with the combination of touch with the other senses. The fourth section deals with the desires, activities and ideas of an isolated man who enjoys possession of all the senses; and ends with observations on a "[[Feral child|wild boy]]" who was found living among bears in the forests of [[Lithuania]].

The conclusion of the whole work is that in the natural order of things, everything has its source in sensation, and yet that this source is not equally abundant in all men; men differ greatly in the degree of vividness with which they feel. Finally, he says that man is nothing but what he has acquired; all innate faculties and ideas are to be swept away. Modern theories of evolution and heredity have differed from this.

Condillac's work on politics and history, in his ''Cours d'études'', is considered of less interest. In [[logic]], on which he wrote extensively, he is far less successful than in psychology. He enlarges with much iteration on the supremacy of the analytic method; argues that reasoning consists in the substitution of one proposition for another which is identical with it; and lays it down that science is the same thing as a well-constructed language, a proposition which in his ''{{lang|fr|Langue des calculs}},'' he tries to prove by the example of arithmetic. His logic is limited by his study of sensations and lack of knowledge of science other than mathematics. He rejects the medieval apparatus of the [[syllogism]]; but is precluded by his standpoint from understanding the active, spiritual character of thought; nor had he that interest in natural science and appreciation of inductive reasoning which form the chief merit of [[John Stuart Mill|JS Mill]]. It is obvious enough that Condillac's anti-spiritual psychology, with its explanation of personality as an aggregate of sensations, leads straight to atheism and determinism. There is, however, no reason to question the sincerity with which he repudiates both these consequences. What he says upon religion is always in harmony with his profession; and he vindicated the freedom of the will in a dissertation that has very little in common with the ''{{lang|fr|Traité des sensations}}'' to which it is appended. The common reproach of [[materialism]] should certainly not be made against him. He always asserts the substantive reality of the soul; and in the opening words of his ''{{lang|fr|Essai}}'', "Whether we rise to heaven, or descend to the abyss, we never get outside ourselves—it is always our own thoughts that we perceive," we have the subjectivist principle that forms the starting-point of [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Language==
Condillac considered language as the vehicle by which senses and emotions were transformed into higher mental faculties. He believed that the structure of language reflects the structure of thought, and compared ideas to the sounds of a harpsichord. His theories had a major effect on the development of [[linguistics]].

Condillac promoted "[[Sensualism|sensationalism]]," a theory that says all knowledge comes from the senses and there are no innate ideas. Condillac promoted an expressionist theory of linguistic creation that anticipates the prime features of later thoughts about language by German theorist [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803).&lt;ref&gt;George Albert Wells, ''The Origin of Language: Aspects of the Discussion from Condillac to Wundt'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
Condillac's 'Le Commerce et le Gouvernement' (published in 1776, the same year as [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'') attempted to place economics in a coherent logical framework. He was a friend of [[François Quesnay]] - leader of the [[Physiocrats]].  Much of Condillac's work reflected mainstream Physiocrats, particularly his analysis of the structure of taxation and proposals for the revival of the economy, but he also proposed another line of argument, claiming that producers work to obtain utility. Most physiocrats rejected utility and the idea was ignored until his 'rediscovery' by [[Stanley Jevons]] and [[Carl Menger]] in 1871.

In his theory of "vrai prix" [true price], Condillac proposed a theory of human history divided into two phases: progress and decline. Progress is marked by a rational development and use of resources; decline is precipitated by bad behavior from the upper classes that then trickles down to the workers, encouraging excess, luxury, and false prices that harm the masses. Condillac saw the remedy to this as "vrai prix," a true price created by the unimpeded interaction of supply and demand, to be achieved by complete deregulation. People would be taught to work toward their best interest in an open market through a reshaping of their perceptions. By advocating of a free market economy in contrast to the prevailing contemporary policy of state control in France, Condillac influenced [[classical liberal]] economics&lt;ref&gt;Orain (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Condillac's ''Histoire ancienne'' and ''Histoire moderne'' (1758–1767) demonstrated how the experience and observation of the past aided man. History was not a mere retelling of the past, but a source of information and inspiration as well. Reason and critical thinking can improve man's lot and destroy superstition and fanaticism. History thus served as a moral, political, and philosophical textbook which taught man to live better. Thus the two histories present the basic program of the Enlightenment in crystallized form.

==Legacy==
As was fitting to a disciple of Locke, Condillac's ideas have had most importance in their effect upon English thought. In matters connected with the association of ideas, the supremacy of pleasure and pain, and the general explanation of all mental contents as sensations or transformed sensations, his influence can be traced upon the Mills and upon [[Alexander Bain|Bain]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. And, apart from any definite propositions, Condillac did a notable work in the direction of making psychology a science; it is a great step from the desultory, genial observation of Locke to the rigorous analysis of Condillac, short-sighted and defective as that analysis may seem to us in the light of fuller knowledge.

His method, however, of imaginative reconstruction was by no means suited to English ways of thinking. In spite of his protests against abstraction, hypothesis and synthesis, his allegory of the statue is in the highest degree abstract, hypothetical and synthetic. [[James Mill]], who stood more by the study of concrete realities, put Condillac into the hands of his youthful son with the warning that here was an example of what to avoid in the method of psychology. A modern historian has compared&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, Catherine, ''Rhetoric on the Margin of Modernity, Vico, Condillac, [[Monboddo]]'', Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, Illinois (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Condillac with [[Scottish Enlightenment]] [[philosopher]] and [[History of evolution|pre-evolutionary thinker]] [[Lord Monboddo]], who had a similar fascination with abstraction and ideas.  In France Condillac's doctrine, so congenial to the tone of 18th century philosophism, reigned in the schools for over fifty years, challenged only by a few who, like [[Maine de Biran]], saw that it gave no sufficient account of volitional experience. Early in the 19th century, the romantic awakening of [[Germany]] had spread to France, and sensationism was displaced by the eclectic spiritualism of [[Victor Cousin]].

Condillac's collected works were published in 1798 (23 vols.) and two or three times subsequently; the last edition (1822) has an introductory dissertation by [[A. F. Théry]]. The ''{{lang|fr|Encyclopédie méthodique}}'' has a very long article on Condillac by [[Naigeon]]. Biographical details and criticism of the ''{{lang|fr|Traité des systèmes}}'' in [[J. P. Damiron]]'s ''{{lang|fr|Mémoires pour servir a l'histoire de to philosophie au dixhuitieme siècle}}'', tome iii.; a full criticism in V Cousin's ''{{lang|fr|Cours de l'histoire de la philosophie moderne}}'', ser. i. tome iii. Consult also F Rethoré, ''{{lang|fr|Condillac ou l'empirisme et le rationalisme}}'' (1864); L Dewaule, ''{{lang|fr|Condillac et la psychologie anglaise contemporaine}}'' (1891); histories of philosophy.

In ''Condillac's statue'', a chapter in ''A Mind So Rare: The evolution of human consciousness'' (Norton, 2001), psychologist and cognitive neuroscientist [[Merlin Donald]] argues that Condillac was the first [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]].
