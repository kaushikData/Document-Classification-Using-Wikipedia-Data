The '''''AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors''''' is a compilation of the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA)'s [[emission factor]] information on [[air pollution]], first published in 1968. {{As of |2018}}, the last edition is the 5th from 2010. 

==History==
The AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors is a compilation of [[emission factor]]s of [[Air pollution|air pollutants]], in other words numbers which relate the quantity of a pollutant released into the ambient air with a certain activity. This compilation was first compiled and published by the [[US Public Health Service]] in 1968. In 1972, it was revised and issued as the second edition by the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] EPA. 
In 1985, the subsequent fourth edition was split into two volumes: Volume I has since included stationary [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|point and area source]] [[emission factor]]s, and Volume II includes [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|mobile source]] emission factors. Volume I is currently in its fifth edition and is available on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;EPA [https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-factors-and-quantification/ap-42-compilation-air-emission-factors AP 42, Volume I] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924132127/http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/index.html |date=September 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Volume II is no longer maintained as such, but [[roadway air dispersion model]]s for estimating emissions from onroad vehicles and from [[non-road vehicle]]s and mobile equipment are available on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;EPA [http://www.epa.gov/otaq/models.htm Mobile source emission models] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513041628/http://www.epa.gov/otaq/models.htm |date=May 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In routine common usage, Volume I of the emission factor compilation is very often referred to as simply ''AP 42''.

==Content==
Air pollution emission factors are usually expressed as the weight of the pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e.g., kilograms of particulate matter emitted per megagram of coal burned). The factors help to estimate emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, the factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages. 

The equation for the estimation of emissions before [[Air pollution#Control devices|emission reduction controls]] are applied is:

:'''E = A × EF'''

and for emissions after reduction controls are applied:

:'''E = A × EF × (1-ER/100)'''

Chapter 5, Section 5.1 "Petroleum Refining" discusses the air pollutant emissions from the equipment in the various refinery processing units as well as from the auxiliary steam-generating boilers, furnaces and engines, and Table 5.1.1 includes the pertinent emission factors. Table 5.1.2 includes the emission factors for the fugitive air pollutant emissions from the large wet [[cooling tower]]s in [[Oil refinery|refineries]] and from the oil/water separators used in treating refinery [[wastewater]].

The fugitive air pollutant emission factors from [[safety valve|relief valves]], piping [[valves]], open-ended piping lines or drains, piping [[flange]]s,  sample connections, and [[mechanical seal|seals]] on [[pump]] and [[Gas compressor|compressor]] shafts are discussed and included the report EPA-458/R-95-017, "Protocol for Equipment Leak Emission Estimates" which is included in the Chapter 5 section of AP 42. That report includes the emission factors developed by the EPA for petroleum refineries and for the synthetic organic chemical industry (SOCMI).

In most cases, the emission factors in Chapter 5 are included for both ''uncontrolled'' conditions before emission reduction controls are implemented and ''controlled'' conditions after specified emission reduction methods are implemented.

Chapter 7 "Liquid Storage Tanks" is devoted to the methodology for calculating the emissions losses from the six basic tank designs used for organic liquid storage: [[Fixed roof tank|fixed roof]] (vertical and
horizontal), [[External_floating_roof_tank|external floating roof]], domed external (or covered) floating roof, internal floating roof, variable vapor space, and pressure (low and high). The methodology in Chapter 7 was developed by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] in collaboration with the EPA.

The EPA has developed a software program named "TANKS" which performs the Chapter 7 methodology for calculating emission losses from storage tanks.  The program's installer file along with a user manual, and the source code are available on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/software/tanks/index.html#order TANKS download site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305212130/http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/software/tanks/index.html#order |date=March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters 5 and 7 discussed above are illustrative of the type of information contained in the other chapters of AP 42. It should also be noted that many of the fugitive emission factors in Chapter 5 and the emissions calculation methodology in Chapter 7 and the TANKS program also apply to many other industrial categories besides the petroleum industry.

Although made available to other organizations, the materials were primarily used in courses taught to youth ages 12–14 (in mixed-gender groups) in [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] congregations.

AYS covered many topics including anatomy, gender identity, relationships, sexual intercourse and intimacy; as well as covering sexually transmitted diseases and birth control. AYS was based on the assumption that sexuality is a natural and healthy part of being a human. It considered the wide range of sexual feelings and behaviors as normal. AYS was unique among sex education courses because it used visual materials that depicted human sexuality in a realistic and graphic fashion. For example, film strips used in the course showed images of real [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]] encounters, and [[masturbation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The slides concluded with images of the man ejaculating into his navel and then tasting his own semen. Other media used in the course of AYS included audio tapes of interviews with [[transgender]], homosexual, and heterosexual men and women speaking about their sexuality.

AYS was considered very controversial both at the time of its inception and in the mid-1990s when it was replaced by [[Our Whole Lives]]. It was also featured in the book ''[[Harmful to Minors]]'' by [[Judith Levine]] as an example of complete sexual education.

The '''American Association of Physics Teachers''' ('''AAPT''') was founded in 1930 for the purpose of "dissemination of knowledge of physics, particularly by way of teaching."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/aboutaapt/ About AAPT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 10,000 members that reside in over 30 countries. AAPT publications include two [[peer-reviewed journal]]s, the ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'' and ''[[The Physics Teacher]]''. The association has two annual National Meetings (winter and summer) and has regional sections with their own meetings and organization. The association also offers grants and awards for physics educators, including the Richtmyer Memorial Award,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/Programs/awards/richtmyer.cfm Richtmeyer Memorial Award, AAPT website]&lt;/ref&gt; and programs and contests for physics educators and students. It is headquartered at the American Center for Physics in [[College Park, Maryland]].

==History==
The American Association of Physics Teachers was founded on December 31, 1930, when forty-five physicists held a meeting during the joint [[American Physical Society|APS]]-AAAS meeting in Cleveland specifically for that purpose.

The AAPT became a founding member of the [[American Institute of Physics]] after the other founding members were convinced of the stability of the AAPT itself after a new constitution for the AAPT was agreed upon.

==Contests==
The AAPT sponsors a number of competitions. The [[Physics Bowl]], [[Six Flags]]' [[roller coaster]] contest, and the US Physics Team are just a few. The US physics team is determined by two preliminary exams and a week and a half long "boot camp." Each year, five members are selected to compete against dozens of countries in the [[International Physics Olympiad]] (IPHO).

An '''apologue''' or '''apolog''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀπόλογος, a "statement" or "account") is a brief fable or allegorical story with pointed or exaggerated details, meant to serve as a pleasant vehicle for a moral doctrine or to convey a useful lesson without stating it explicitly.  Unlike a [[fable]], the moral is more important than the narrative details.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apologue|volume=2|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the [[parable]], the apologue is a tool of [[rhetoric]]al [[argument]] used to convince or persuade.

Among the best known ancient and classical examples are that of [[Jotham]] in the [[Book of Judges]] (9:7-15); "The Belly and its Members," by the patrician [[Agrippa Menenius Lanatus (consul 503 BC)|Agrippa Menenius Lanatus]] in the second book of [[Livy]]; and perhaps most famous of all, those of [[Aesop]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Well-known modern examples of this literary form include [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and the [[Br'er Rabbit]] stories derived from African and [[Cherokee]] cultures and recorded and synthesized by [[Joel Chandler Harris]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}  The term is applied more particularly to a story in which the actors or speakers are either various kinds of animals or are inanimate objects. An apologue is distinguished from a [[fable]] in that there is always some moral sense present in the former, which there need not be in the latter. An apologue is generally dramatic, and has been defined as "a satire in action."&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

An apologue differs from a [[parable]] in several respects. A parable is equally an ingenious tale intended to correct manners, but it can be ''true'' in the sense that "when this kind of actual event happens among men, this is what it means and this is how we should think about it", while an apologue, with its introduction of animals and plants, to which it lends ideas, language and emotions, contains only metaphoric truth: "when this kind of situation exists anywhere in the world, here is an interesting truth about it."  The [[parable]] reaches heights to which the apologue cannot aspire, for the points in which animals and nature present analogies to man are principally those of his lower nature (hunger, desire, pain, fear, etc.), and the lessons taught by the apologue seldom therefore reach beyond prudential morality (keep yourself safe, find ease where you can, plan for the future, don't misbehave or you'll eventually be caught and punished), whereas the parable aims at representing the relations between man and existence or higher powers (know your role in the universe, behave well towards all you encounter, kindness and respect are of higher value than cruelty and slander).  It finds its framework in the world of nature as it actually is, and not in any parody of it, and it exhibits real and not fanciful analogies. The apologue seizes on that which humans have in common with other creatures, and the parable on that which we have in common with a greater existence. Still, in spite of the difference of moral level, [[Martin Luther]] thought so highly of apologues as counselors of virtue that he edited and revised Aesop and wrote a characteristic preface to the volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}} for the main text, but the origin of the examples is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt;  The parable is always blunt and devoid of subtlety, and requires no interpretation; the apologue by nature necessitates at least some degree of reflection and thought to achieve understanding, and in this sense it demands more of the listener than the parable does.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shonmehta.com/2017/01/calamity.html|title=Calamity|website=www.shonmehta.com|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the apologue is extremely ancient and comes from the Middle East and its surrounding area (Persia, Asia Minor, Egypt, etc.), which is the Classical fatherland of everything connected with [[allegory]], [[metaphor]] and [[imagination]]. Veiled truth was often necessary in the Middle East, particularly among the [[slave]]s, who dared not reveal their minds too openly. It is noteworthy that the two fathers of apologue in the West were slaves, namely [[Aesop]] and [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]]. [[La Fontaine]] in France; [[John Gay|Gay]] and [[Robert Dodsley|Dodsley]] in England; [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert|Gellert]], [[Lessing]] and [[Friedrich von Hagedorn|Hagedorn]] in Germany; [[Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa|Tomas de Iriarte]] in Spain, and [[Ivan Krylov|Krylov]] in Russia, were leading later writers of apologues.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Length is not an essential matter in the definition of an apologue. Those of La Fontaine are often very short, as, for example, "Le Coq et la Perle" ("The Cock and the Pearl").&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

''"A cock was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens when suddenly he espied something shining amid the straw. “Ho! ho!” quoth he, “that’s for me,” and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw. What did it turn out to be but a Pearl that by some chance had been lost in the yard? “You may be a treasure,” quoth Master Cock, “to men that prize you, but for me I would rather have a single barley-corn than a peck of pearls.”''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

On the other hand, in the romances of [[Reynard the Fox]] we have medieval apologues arranged in cycles, and attaining epical dimensions. An Italian fabulist, [[Corti]], is said to have developed an apologue of "The Talking Animals" reaching twenty-six [[canto]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Antoine Houdar de la Motte|La Motte]], writing at a time when this species of literature was universally admired, attributes its popularity to the fact that it manages and flatters [[amour-propre]] by inculcating virtue in an amusing manner without seeming to dictate or insist. This was the ordinary 18th-century view of the matter, but [[Rousseau]] contested the educational value of instruction given in this indirect form.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

A work by P. Soullé, ''La Fontaine et ses devanciers'' (1866), is a history of the apologue from the earliest times until its final triumph in France.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] wrote a propos his ''[[Persian Letters]]'' "There are certain truths of which it is not enough to persuade, but which must be made to be ''felt''.  Such are the moral verities. Perhaps a bit of history will be more touching than subtle philosophy."{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''Arnold Dashefsky''', born in 1942, is a professor at the [[University of Connecticut]] who has written several books on the topics relating to [[Jewish]] [[ethnicity]], [[culture]], [[ideologies]], among others.

Dashefsky is currently director of the [[North American Jewish Data Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Staff  {{!}} Berman Jewish DataBank |url=https://www.jewishdatabank.org/About/staff.cfm |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Dashefsky's key theses is that [[Jewish identity]] is taken for granted in populations, such as [[Israel]] where Jews make up a majority of the population. Furthermore, he has asserted that the number of Jews in the [[United States]] is roughly the same as the number of Jews in Israel. Hence, he feels that Jewish identity should be no less strong in either nation.

'''Bridge Operational''' (or Operations) '''Quality Assurance''' ('''BOQA''' - pronounced BOUQUA or / bəʊ'kwɒ /) is a methodology utilised in shipping and which originates from the similar FOQA ([[Flight operations quality assurance]]) concept in aviation. BOQA is a methodology with which ship owners/operators, ship Captains, and other associated shipping stakeholders can automatically and systematically monitor, track, trend and analyse operational quality of (seagoing) vessels. The main target with BOQA is to enhance maritime safety and to enable proactive decision making in ship operations. The BOQA methodology can be used in both conventional manned ships and in autonomous or unmanned vessels.

== Description==
BOQA is best developed as a non-punitive company-internal methodology or process, which has the overall target of assisting the ship Captain and the ship operator to maintain a high level of safety and operational quality.

BOQA has been described as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ntsb.gov/news/events/Documents/Panel6_Christie_Carnival_Corp.pdf|title=Innovative Techniques to Enhance Safety|last=Christie|first=David|date=25 March 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''A system which delivers 24/7 electronic monitoring and electronic alarms when set operational parameters are deviated from''
* ''During normal operations, BOQA will collect and analyse digital operational data direct from ships operation equipment''
* ''BOQA data is unique because it can provide objective information that is not available through other methods''
* ''A BOQA program can identify operational situations in which there is increased risk, allowing operators to take early corrective action before that risk results in an incident or accident'' 
* ''The BOQA program is a tool in the operators overall operational risk assessment and prevention program''
* ''BOQA, being proactive in identifying and addressing risk will enhance safety''

== Methodology ==
BOQA is used to objectively monitor the human operational performance and external factors, such as weather and other traffic around the vessel, by utilising various types of sensor and external data and comparing this data with defined best-practices and [[Standard operating procedure]] (SOPs). BOQA is &lt;u&gt;usually not used&lt;/u&gt; to monitor the internal technical performance of the vessel machinery and equipment-base, which in most cases already has a wide range of proprietary monitoring and alarm functions.

BOQA is often a software system consisting of shipboard real-time data collection and sensing, automated data transmission between the vessel and shore and a shore-based system which receives, combines, analyses, alerts and stores the data according to defined rules and logic.

BOQA usually includes three "time-domains", ie:

# a historical database of data and events and which is used for trend- and pattern analysis
# a real-time reactive stream analytics component which can react to events or deviations in real- or near-real-time (NRT)
# a predictive and pro-active component, which assists the operator in taking actions before an event occurs

=== Event types ===
BOQA is a continuously developing methodology, much in the same way as FOQA. At present time BOQA solutions are known to be able monitor following event types:

* Cross-track error or deviation from a defined navigational route (the [[Costa Concordia disaster]] is known to be caused by such deviation) 
* Safety corridor, ie is the ship sailing within its defined safe waters 
* Collision risk based on Proximity (ship too close to own ship), CPA (Closest point of approach which measures the time and distance to a potential collision) and BCR (Bow Cross Range)
* Entry into a restricted or protected area
* Severe list, heel or roll
* Excessive accelerations
* Excessive turns
* Crash stop
* Heavy weather at present position and along a planned route (this is a predictive component)
* Sudden change in atmospheric pressure (which is an indicator of oncoming change in weather)
* Speed monitoring, which can be used for example in [[Charterparty]] Compliance monitoring
* Unscheduled stops along the route, which may lead to schedule-deviations and unwanted changes in arrival time
* Proximity to a shore line, ice edge or iceberg
* Rescue boat launch
* AIS ([[Automatic identification system]]) status change
* Black-out

=== Inputs ===
BOQA relies on data from various sources. The key data sources are:

* Ship's AIS transponders ([[Automatic identification system]]), which give location, speed and course of the vessel itself and the surrounding traffic
* Ship's GPS ([[Global Positioning System]]), which also gives location, speed and course
* Motion sensors
* Barometric pressure sensors
* Real-time weather data from sensors
* Weather forecast data
* Ship's navigational ECDIS ([[Electronic Chart Display and Information System]]) route
* External geographic data, such as restricted areas, PSSAs ([[Marine protected area]]) or TSS ([[Traffic Separation Scheme]])
* Ship's electronic logbook

== Applications ==
BOQA is not yet known to be officially mandated or regulated by any official maritime bodies, such as [[International Maritime Organization]], Classification societies or Flag state administrations.

[[Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.|Royal Caribbean Cruise]] line stated in their 2012 Stewardship report that they were evaluating a BOQA system. &lt;ref&gt;RCCL 2012 Stewardship report, page 13 "Maritime safety"http://www.royalcaribbean.com/content/en_US/pdf/13034530_RCL_2012StwrdshpTwoPgrs_v4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|In 2011, RCL began evaluating a voyage data recording analysis and trending system, known as Bridge Operations
Quality Assurance (BOQA), based on a similar program used in the aviation industry (the Flight Operations Quality
Assurance program). In 2012 we made progress in the technical development of this system for marine use, and we
have installed two prototypes on our vessels for testing purposes. This system will enhance our data analysis that
supports our accident prevention initiatives.

Both the university and the town of [[Berea, Ohio|Berea]] were founded by [[Methodism|Methodist]] settlers from [[Connecticut]]. These settlers moved west after their homes were burned by the British in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. The region in Northern [[Ohio]] became known as the [[Western Reserve]] (a part of which was designated the [[Firelands]], as the state of [[Connecticut]] gave land grants to these fire victims). Among early settlers of this area was [[John Baldwin (educator)|John Baldwin]]. Baldwin enjoyed early success in the [[sandstone]] [[quarry]] industry.

The Reverend Jacob Rothweiler, a professor at Baldwin University, named his project after [[James Wallace (benefactor)|James Wallace]], and [[German Wallace College]] was founded in 1855. Students at both institutions were free to enroll in courses at Baldwin or German Wallace. Baldwin and Wallace were the primary benefactors to the two Berea colleges. After their deaths, and the decline of the quarry industry in Ohio, Baldwin University came close to financial ruin. Options were thin, and the [[United Methodist Church]] considered merging the schools with the more successful [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in 1874, to form the University of Cleveland. The University of Cleveland concept was abandoned for a more elegant solution. Baldwin University and German Wallace College merged in 1913 to form Baldwin–Wallace College.

The college's present day campus can be much accredited to the leadership of [[Alfred Bryan Bonds]]; through much of the mid-20th century, Baldwin Wallace grew to be a large and well respected suburban institution. Bonds oversaw the construction of fifteen buildings on campus during his 26-year tenure. [[Neal Malicky]]'s tenure as college president stabilized the college's finances and endowment, finally placing Baldwin Wallace in financial security after years of financial struggle. Following Malicky's presidency, Mark Collier served as president for seven years, overseeing a campus master plan that has led to many major renovations on campus. In recent years the college has expanded and renovated residence halls and academic buildings. In addition, the college has purchased existing buildings in the [[Berea, Ohio|Berea]] community for academic and student residential use.

In the fall of 2011, a task force was developed by BW President Dick Durst. On February 11, 2012, it was announced that Baldwin–Wallace College would become Baldwin Wallace University after approval by the BW Board of Trustees. The name would become effective on July 1 of 2012, with complete implementation by the end of 2012. In addition to the new university designation, seal, and logo, "B-W" would drop the hyphen in its name.&lt;ref name="BW University"/&gt;

In recent years, BW has been a stopping point for political candidates.  During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential campaign]], BW hosted eventual President [[Barack Obama]] and 2008 Presidential candidate [[John McCain]]. In 2012 BW hosted vice presidential candidate [[Paul Ryan]] along with [[Condoleezza Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/mccain-praises-obamas-style-but-says-he-will-prevail-on-issues/?scp=1&amp;sq=obama%20baldwin%20wallace&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=McCain Praises Obama's Style, but Says He Will Prevail on Issues | first=Elisabeth | last=Bumiller | date=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/one-nations-underguarded-individual/?scp=3&amp;sq=obama%20baldwin%20wallace&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=One Nation's Underguarded Individual | first=Tobin | last=Harshaw | date=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last sitting President prior to Obama to visit BW was [[Ronald Reagan]] during George H.

[[File:Wheeler Hall Baldwin Wallace University.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Wheeler Hall is one of several buildings part of the North Campus Historic District]]
The campus is located in [[Berea, Ohio]], a suburb of [[Cleveland]], Ohio. The campus is built around land that originally was two separate schools that combined in 1913. The campus itself is located next to [[Berea High School]] and is integrated into the neighborhoods of Berea.  The majority of the Campus that exists today was expanded in the 1960s and 1970s. BW prides itself on its many green spaces around campus, such as the North Quad where residence halls, Ritter Library, and academic buildings surround a large field with sidewalks. Buildings that surround the quad include Malicky Center, Wheeler Hall, The Life &amp; Earth Science building, the Center for Innovation and Growth, the Observatory, the President's house, several residence halls and the Alumni Wall. During the presidency of Alfred Bryan Bonds, the Alumni Wall (located behind North Hall) was created to recognize alumni who have contributed to the development of the campus. The North Quad is also home to a diverse tree collection, a Greenhouse, a native Ohio plants garden and a commons area (located behind Lang Hall). In 2009, BW opened the Thomas Family Center for Science and Innovation. The project connected the Life &amp; Earth Science building and Wilker Hall.

The challenges include obstacle course challenges, human pyramid-making contests, boat races, and tug competitions, which take place both on campus and at nearby Cleveland Metroparks. During the April Reign weekend, the college has hosted musical groups and singers such as [[Toby Keith]], [[Maroon 5]], [[Chingy]], [[Josh Gracin]], [[New Found Glory]], [[Matt Nathanson]], [[Hellogoodbye]], [[Emerson Drive]], [[Asher Roth]], [[Sammy Adams]], and [[Jeremih]]. The event was formerly known as May Day (when the campus was on quarters).

===BW Bach Festival===
{{Main|Baldwin Wallace Conservatory of Music#History}} 
The BW Conservatory of Music is home to the BW Bach Festival, the oldest collegiate Bach festival in the nation, as well as the second-oldest Bach festival in the nation. The festival was founded in 1932 by Professor Albert Riemenschneider (longtime Director of the College Conservatory) and his wife, Selma. The then Baldwin-Wallace Festival Choir and Orchestra presented the first Bach Festival in June 1933 and has continued on an annual basis ever since.&lt;ref name="BW Bach festival"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|title=B-W Bach Festival serves up inspiration on intimate and grand scales|url=http://www.cleveland.com/musicdance/index.ssf/2011/04/bach_festival_review_1.html|accessdate=20 February 2012|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bach Festival History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bach Festival History|url=http://www.bw.edu/academics/libraries/bach/festivals/bachfest/about/|work=BW history conservatory|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community Service===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}[[File:Berea OH.jpg|thumb|250px|right|BW offers many service opportunities in [[Berea, Ohio|Berea]]]]
Beyond [[service-learning]] and campus community services organizations, BW offers service opportunities in [[Berea, Ohio|Berea]], the [[Greater Cleveland]] area, and internationally. One campus tradition is "Berea Service Day," which happens in the fall semester and is a joint service project between the city of [[Berea, Ohio|Berea]] and Baldwin Wallace. As well, BW offers service opportunities through the college's Office of Community Outreach. Beyond offering service opportunities in the Cleveland area, the Office of Community Outreach at BW offers service opportunities nationwide and internationally through [[Alternative break]] trips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bw.edu/stulife/oco/ B-W: Office of Community Outreach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324070730/http://www.bw.edu/stulife/oco/ |date=March 24, 2009 }}. Bw.edu. Retrieved on 2012-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the Office of Community Outreach, the campus has student-run organization groups. Groups at BW include [[Circle K International|Circle K]], Habitat for Humanity and Dance Marathon. Dance Marathon works in conjunction with the [[Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation]], to put on a 12-hour event to raise awareness and funds for pediatric [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].

===Homecoming===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}

Homecoming occurs during the fall semester and is a major event that brings the [[Berea, Ohio|Berea]] and BW community together. Homecoming weekend brings the university together through class reunions, Hall of Fame inductions, parades through campus, and musical events. Before the BW vs. Mount Union football game, tailgating and cookouts in front of the stadium. Homecoming offers a parade, football event, and a large Alumni gathering.

BW's school colors are officially brown and gold, though in the past they adopted burgundy and teal as well as maroon and gold for their marketing literature.&lt;ref name="bw.edu"/&gt;

The school's varsity sports teams are the [[Baldwin Wallace Yellow Jackets]]. They participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] and the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]]. The university has long rivalries with [[John Carroll University]] and [[University of Mount Union]].

Lou Higgins Center is home to the physical education department, athletics, and recreational sports and services. The Lou Higgins Center was renovated and expanded in 2005. Beyond Varsity Athletics, Baldwin Wallace offers club sports, Intramurals, Aerobic Classes, a Fitness Center and Weight Room. Higgins Center is home to many of the athletic offices, along with Bagley Hall. Bagley Hall was originally owned by the [[Cleveland Browns]] and was used as the team's summer training facility. After the Browns left for Baltimore, the university converted the facility into a residence hall.  In 2012, Bagley Hall was converted into athletic offices.

Baldwin Wallace's [[College football|football]] team was coached by [[Lee Tressel]], who led the team to an undefeated record in 1978, and subsequently the [[NCAA Division III Football Championship|NCAA Division III Championship]]. In 2008, the [[artificial turf|athletic turf]] on George Finnie Stadium was renovated and named "[[Tressel Field]]" in honor of the [[Jim Tressel|Tressel Family]].

Perhaps the most notable BW athlete from the 20th century was [[Harrison Dillard]], the only male so far to win Olympic titles in both [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]] and [[hurdling]] events, in the [[1948 Summer Olympics]]. The teams of the [[Sidney High School (Ohio)|Sidney High School]] Yellow Jackets were named after Baldwin Wallace graduate Granville Robinson became Head Coach at Sidney High School.

In 2009, after almost 20 years of use, BW adopted a new logo and modified the mascot for the athletic teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bw.edu/news/newstinger/ B-W: Stinger Has a new Look] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112095639/http://www.bw.edu/news/newstinger/ |date=January 12, 2010 }}.

In [[biochemistry]] and [[metabolism]], '''beta-oxidation''' is the [[catabolism|catabolic process]] by which [[fatty acid]] molecules are broken down&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Houten SM, Wanders RJ | title = A general introduction to the biochemistry of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation | journal = Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 469–77 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20195903 | pmc = 2950079 | doi = 10.1007/s10545-010-9061-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the cytosol in prokaryotes and in the [[mitochondria]] in eukaryotes to generate [[acetyl-CoA]], which enters the [[citric acid cycle]], and [[NADH]] and [[FADH2|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which are co-enzymes used in the [[electron transport chain]]. It is named as such because the [[alpha and beta carbon|beta carbon]] of the fatty acid undergoes oxidation to a [[carbonyl]] group. Beta-oxidation is primarily facilitated by the [[mitochondrial trifunctional protein]], an enzyme complex associated with the [[inner mitochondrial membrane]], although [[very long chain fatty acid]]s are oxidized in [[peroxisome]]s.

The overall reaction for one cycle of beta oxidation is:

:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-acyl-CoA  +  FAD + {{chem|NAD|+}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} + CoA → C&lt;sub&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sub&gt;-acyl-CoA + {{chem|FADH|2}} + NADH + {{chem|H|+}} + acetyl-CoA

==Overview==
Fatty acid catabolism consists of:
#Activation and membrane transport of free fatty acids by binding to [[coenzyme A]].
#Oxidation of the beta carbon to a carbonyl group.
#Cleavage of two-carbon segments resulting in [[acetyl-CoA]].
#Oxidation of [[acetyl-CoA]] to [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[citric acid cycle]].
#Electron transfer from electron carriers to the [[electron transport chain]] in [[oxidative phosphorylation]].

==Activation and membrane transport==
[[File:Metabolism1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A diagrammatic illustration of the process of lipolysis (in a fat cell) induced by high [[epinephrine]] and low [[insulin]] levels in the blood. Epinephrine binds to a [[Adrenergic receptor#β receptors|beta-adrenergic]] receptor in the cell wall of the adipocyte, which causes [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] to be generated inside the cell. The cAMP activates a [[protein kinase]], which phosphorylates and thus, in turn, activates a [[hormone-sensitive lipase]] in the fat cell. This lipase cleaves free fatty acids from their attachment to glycerol in the fat stored in the fat droplet of the adipocyte. The free fatty acids and glycerol are then released into the blood.]]

The illustrated acyl chain is, for diagrammatic purposes, only 12 carbon atoms long. Most fatty acids in human plasma are 16 or 18 carbon atoms long. CAT is inhibited by high concentrations of [[malonyl-CoA]] (the first committed step in [[fatty acid synthesis]]) in the cytoplasm. This means that fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid catabolism cannot occur simultaneously in any given cell.]]

During this process an acyl-CoA molecule which is 2 carbons shorter than it was at the beginning of the process is formed. Acetyl-CoA, water and 5 [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecules are the other products of each beta-oxidative event, until the entire acyl-CoA molecule has been reduced to a set of [[acetyl-CoA]] molecules.]]

Free fatty acids cannot penetrate any biological membrane due to their negative charge. Free fatty acids must cross the cell membrane through specific [[transport proteins]], such as the [[Solute carrier family|SLC27]] family fatty acid transport protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stahl A | title = A current review of fatty acid transport proteins (SLC27) | journal = Pflügers Archiv | volume = 447 | issue = 5 | pages = 722–7 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 12856180 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-003-1106-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson CM, Stahl A | title = SLC27 fatty acid transport proteins | journal = Molecular Aspects of Medicine | volume = 34 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 516–28 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23506886 | pmc = 3602789 | doi = 10.1016/j.mam.2012.07.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the [[cytosol]], the following processes bring fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix so that beta-oxidation can take place.
#[[Long-chain-fatty-acid—CoA ligase]] catalyzes the reaction between a fatty acid with [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to give a fatty acyl adenylate, plus inorganic pyrophosphate, which then reacts with free [[coenzyme A]] to give a fatty acyl-CoA ester and [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]].
#If the fatty acyl-CoA has a long chain, then the [[Carnitine#Carnitine shuttle: Activation and transportation of fatty acids into the mitochondria|carnitine shuttle]] must be utilized:
##Acyl-CoA is transferred to the hydroxyl group of carnitine by [[carnitine palmitoyltransferase I]], located on the cytosolic faces of the [[outer mitochondrial membrane|outer]] and [[inner mitochondrial membrane]]s.
##Acyl-carnitine is shuttled inside by a [[carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase]], as a carnitine is shuttled outside.
##Acyl-carnitine is converted back to acyl-CoA by [[carnitine palmitoyltransferase II]], located on the interior face of the [[inner mitochondrial membrane]]. The liberated carnitine is shuttled back to the cytosol, as an acyl-carnitine is shuttled into the matrix.
#If the fatty acyl-CoA contains a short chain, these [[short-chain fatty acid]]s can simply diffuse through the inner mitochondrial membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charney AN, Micic L, Egnor RW | title = Nonionic diffusion of short-chain fatty acids across rat colon | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 274 | issue = 3 Pt 1 | pages = G518–24 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9530153 | url = http://ajpgi.physiology.org/content/274/3/G518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General mechanism==

Once the fatty acid is inside the [[mitochondrial matrix]], beta-oxidation occurs by cleaving two carbons every cycle to form acetyl-CoA. The process consists of 4 steps.

#A long-chain fatty acid is [[dehydrogenation|dehydrogenated]] to create a trans [[double bond]] between C2 and C3. This is catalyzed by [[acyl CoA dehydrogenase]] to produce trans-delta 2-enoyl CoA. It uses FAD as an electron acceptor and it is reduced to FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  
#Trans-delta2-enoyl CoA is hydrated at the double bond to produce L-3-hydroxyacyl CoA by [[enoyl-CoA hydratase]]. 
#L-3-hydroxyacyl CoA is dehydrogenated again to create 3-ketoacyl CoA by 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase. This enzyme uses NAD as an electron acceptor. 
#[[Thiolysis]] occurs between C2 and C3 (alpha and beta carbons) of 3-ketoacyl CoA. Thiolase enzyme catalyzes the reaction when a new molecule of coenzyme A breaks the bond by nucleophilic attack on C3. This releases the first two carbon units, as acetyl CoA, and a fatty acyl CoA minus two carbons. The process continues until all of the carbons in the fatty acid are turned into acetyl CoA.

Fatty acids are oxidized by most of the tissues in the body. However, some tissues such as the [[Erythrocytes|red blood cells]] of mammals (which do not contain mitochondria),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stier A, Bize P, Schull Q, Zoll J, Singh F, Geny B, Gros F, Royer C, Massemin S, Criscuolo F | title = Avian erythrocytes have functional mitochondria, opening novel perspectives for birds as animal models in the study of ageing | journal = Frontiers in Zoology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 33 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23758841 | pmc = 3686644 | doi = 10.1186/1742-9994-10-33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and cells of the [[central nervous system]] do not use fatty acids for their energy requirements,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schönfeld P, Reiser G | title = Why does brain metabolism not favor burning of fatty acids to provide energy? Reflections on disadvantages of the use of free fatty acids as fuel for brain | journal = Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism | volume = 33 | issue = 10 | pages = 1493–9 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23921897 | pmc = 3790936 | doi = 10.1038/jcbfm.2013.128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead use carbohydrates (red blood cells and neurons) or [[ketone bodies]] (neurons only).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshida T, Shevkoplyas SS | title = Anaerobic storage of red blood cells | journal = Blood Transfusion = Trasfusione del Sangue | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 220–36 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20967163 | pmc = 2957487 | doi = 10.2450/2010.0022-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because many fatty acids are not fully saturated or do not have an even number of carbons, several different mechanisms have evolved, described below.
{{-}}
==Even-numbered saturated fatty acids==
Once inside the mitochondria, each cycle of β-oxidation, liberating a two carbon unit ([[acetyl-CoA]]), occurs in a sequence of four reactions:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Description''' || '''Diagram''' || '''Enzyme''' || '''End product'''
 |- 
 | ''[[Dehydrogenation]] by [[flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]]:'' The first step is the oxidation of the fatty acid by Acyl-CoA-Dehydrogenase. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of a [[double bond]] between the C-2 and C-3.  || [[Image:Beta-Oxidation1.svg|center|400px]] || [[acyl CoA dehydrogenase]] || trans-Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-enoyl-CoA
 |- 
 | ''Hydration:'' The next step is the [[hydration reaction|hydration]] of the bond between C-2 and C-3. The reaction is [[stereospecific]], forming only the L [[isomer]]. || [[Image:Beta-Oxidation2.svg|center|400px]] ||  [[enoyl CoA hydratase]]  || L-β-hydroxyacyl CoA
 |- 
 | ''[[Oxidation]] by [[NADH|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]:'' The third step is the [[oxidation]] of L-β-hydroxyacyl CoA by NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This converts the [[hydroxyl]] group into a [[ketone|keto]] group. || [[Image:Beta-Oxidation3.svg|center|400px]] || [[3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase]]  || β-ketoacyl CoA
 |- 
 | ''[[Thiolysis]]:'' The final step is the cleavage of β-ketoacyl CoA by the [[thiol]] group of another molecule of [[Coenzyme A]]. The thiol is inserted between C-2 and C-3. || [[Image:Beta-Oxidation4.svg|center|400px]] || [[β-ketothiolase]]  || An [[acetyl-CoA]] molecule, and an [[acyl-CoA]] molecule that is two carbons shorter 
|}

This process continues until the entire chain is cleaved into acetyl CoA units. The final cycle produces two separate acetyl CoAs, instead of one acyl CoA and one acetyl CoA.  For every cycle, the Acyl CoA unit is shortened by two carbon atoms. Concomitantly, one molecule of FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NADH and acetyl CoA are formed.

==Odd-numbered saturated fatty acids==
In general, fatty acids with an odd number of carbons are found in the lipids of plants and some marine organisms. Many ruminant animals form a large amount of 3-carbon propionate during the fermentation of carbohydrates in the rumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Nelson DL, Cox MM | date = 2005 | title = Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | edition = 4th | location = New York | publisher = W. H. Freeman and Company | pages = 648–649 | isbn =  978-0-7167-4339-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-chain fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms are found particularly in ruminant fat and milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry | publisher = McGraw-Hill Publishing Company | first = Victor W. | last = Rodwell | name-list-format = vanc | edition = 31st }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chains with an odd-number of [[carbon]]s are oxidized in the same manner as even-numbered chains, but the final products are [[propionyl-CoA]] and Acetyl CoA

Propionyl-CoA is first carboxylated using a [[bicarbonate]] [[ion]] into D-stereoisomer of methylmalonyl-CoA, in a reaction that involves a [[biotin]] [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|co-factor]], ATP, and the enzyme [[propionyl-CoA carboxylase]]. The bicarbonate ion's carbon is added to the middle carbon of propionyl-CoA, forming a D-methylmalonyl-CoA. However, the D conformation is enzymatically converted into the L conformation by [[methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase]], then it undergoes intramolecular rearrangement, which is catalyzed by [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]] (requiring B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; as a coenzyme) to form succinyl-CoA. The [[succinyl-CoA]] formed can then enter the [[citric acid cycle]].

However, whereas acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle by condensing with an existing molecule of oxaloacetate, succinyl-CoA enters the cycle as a principal in its own right. Thus the succinate just adds to the population of circulating molecules in the cycle and undergoes no net metabolization while in it. When this infusion of citric acid cycle intermediates exceeds [[cataplerosis|cataplerotic]] demand (such as for [[aspartate]] or [[glutamate]] synthesis), some of them can be extracted to the [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway, in the liver and kidneys, through [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]], and converted to free glucose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=King|first=Michael | name-list-format = vanc |title=Gluconeogenesis: Synthesis of New Glucose |url=http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/gluconeogenesis.php |work=Subsection: "Propionate" |publisher=themedicalbiochemistrypage.org, LLC |access-date=20 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unsaturated fatty acids==
β-Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids poses a problem since the location of a cis bond can prevent the formation of a trans-Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bond. These situations are handled by an additional two enzymes, [[Enoyl CoA isomerase]] or [[2,4 Dienoyl CoA reductase]].
[[File:Linoleic acid beta oxidation.svg|alt=|thumb|Complete beta oxidation of [[linoleic acid]] (an unsaturated fatty acid).]]
Whatever the conformation of the hydrocarbon chain, β-oxidation occurs normally until the acyl CoA (because of the presence of a double bond) is not an appropriate substrate for [[acyl CoA dehydrogenase]], or [[enoyl CoA hydratase]]:

*If the acyl CoA contains a ''cis-Δ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bond'', then ''cis-Δ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''-[[Enoyl CoA isomerase]] will convert the bond to a ''trans-Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' bond, which is a regular substrate.
*If the acyl CoA contains a ''cis-Δ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; double bond'', then its dehydrogenation yields a 2,4-dienoyl intermediate, which is not a substrate for enoyl CoA hydratase. However, the enzyme [[2,4 Dienoyl CoA reductase]] reduces the intermediate, using NADPH, into ''trans-Δ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''-enoyl CoA. As in the above case, this compound is converted into a suitable intermediate by 3,2-Enoyl CoA isomerase.

To summarize:
*''Odd-numbered'' double bonds are handled by the isomerase.
*''Even-numbered'' double bonds by the reductase (which creates an odd-numbered double bond)

==Peroxisomal beta-oxidation==
Fatty acid oxidation also occurs in [[peroxisome]]s when the fatty acid chains are too long to be handled by the mitochondria. The same enzymes are used in peroxisomes as in the mitochondrial matrix, and acetyl-CoA is generated. It is believed that very long chain (greater than C-22) fatty acids, branched fatty acids,&lt;ref name="pmid9059978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh I | title = Biochemistry of peroxisomes in health and disease | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 167 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–29 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9059978 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006883229684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some [[prostaglandin]]s and [[leukotriene]]s&lt;ref name="GibsonLake2013"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = G. Gordon | last1 = Gibson | first2 = Brian G. | last2 = Lake | name-list-format = vanc |title=Peroxisomes: Biology and Importance in Toxicology and Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YwEMQLzH-bYC&amp;pg=PA69|date=2013-04-08|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-48151-6|pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt; undergo initial oxidation in peroxisomes until [[octanoyl-CoA]] is formed, at which point it undergoes mitochondrial oxidation.&lt;ref name="pmid627552"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lazarow PB | title = Rat liver peroxisomes catalyze the beta oxidation of fatty acids | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 253 | issue = 5 | pages = 1522–8 | date = March 1978 | pmid = 627552 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/253/5/1522.short }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant difference is that oxidation in peroxisomes is not coupled to [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] synthesis. Instead, the high-potential electrons are transferred to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which yields H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It does generate heat however. The enzyme [[catalase]], found exclusively in peroxisomes, converts the [[hydrogen peroxide]] into [[water]] and [[oxygen]].

Peroxisomal β-oxidation also requires enzymes specific to the peroxisome and to very long fatty acids. There are three key differences between the enzymes used for mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation:
#The NADH formed in the third oxidative step cannot be reoxidized in the peroxisome, so reducing equivalents are exported to the cytosol. 
#β-oxidation in the peroxisome requires the use of a peroxisomal [[carnitine acyltransferase]] (instead of carnitine acyltransferase I and II used by the mitochondria) for transport of the activated acyl group into the mitochondria for further breakdown.
#The first oxidation step in the peroxisome is catalyzed by the enzyme [[acyl-CoA oxidase]].
#The [[β-ketothiolase]] used in peroxisomal β-oxidation has an altered substrate specificity, different from the mitochondrial [[β-ketothiolase]].

Peroxisomal oxidation is induced by a high-fat diet and administration of hypolipidemic drugs like [[clofibrate]].

==Energy yield==
The ATP yield for every oxidation cycle is theoretically a maximum yield of 17, as NADH produces 2.5 ATP, FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produces 1.5 and a full rotation of the citric acid cycle produces 10.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} In practice it is closer to 14 ATP for a full oxidation cycle as the theoretical yield is not attained - it is generally closer to 2.5 ATP per NADH molecule produced, 1.5 for each FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule produced and this equates to 10 per cycle of the TCA {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}(according to the [[P/O ratio]]), broken down as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Source''' || '''ATP''' || '''Total'''
 |- 
 |  1 [[FADH2|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] || x 1.5 ATP  || = 1.5 ATP (Theoretically 2 ATP){{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
 |- 
 |  1 [[NADH]] || x 2.5 ATP  || = 2.5 ATP (Theoretically 3 ATP){{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}
 |- 
 | 1 [[acetyl CoA]] ||  x 10 ATP  || = 10 ATP (Theoretically 12 ATP){{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}
 |- 
 | TOTAL  ||     || = 14 ATP
|}

For an even-numbered saturated fat (C&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;), n - 1 oxidations are necessary, and the final process yields an additional acetyl CoA. In addition, two equivalents of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] are lost during the activation of the fatty acid. Therefore, the total ATP yield can be stated as:

:(n - 1) * 14 + 10 - 2 = total ATP{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}
or
:14n-6 (alternatively)
For instance, the ATP yield of [[palmitate]] (C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n = 8'') is:

:(8 - 1) * 14 + 10 - 2 = 106 ATP{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Represented in table form:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Source''' || '''ATP''' || '''Total'''
 |- 
 |  7 FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || x 1.5 ATP  || = 10.5 ATP
 |- 
 |  7 NADH || x 2.5 ATP  || = 17.5 ATP
 |- 
 | 8 acetyl CoA ||  x 10 ATP  || = 80 ATP
 |- 
 | Activation ||     || = -2 ATP
 |- 
 | NET  ||     || = 106 ATP
|}{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

For sources that use the larger ATP production numbers described above, the total would be 129 ATP ={(8-1)*17+12-2} equivalents per palmitate.

Beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids changes the ATP yield due to the requirement of two possible additional enzymes.

==Similarities between beta-oxidation and citric acid cycle==
The reactions of beta oxidation and part of citric acid cycle present structural similarities in three of four reactions of the beta oxidation: the oxidation by FAD, the hydration, and the oxidation by NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Each enzyme of these metabolic pathways presents structural similarity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Clinical significance==
There are at least 25 enzymes and specific transport proteins in the β-oxidation pathway.&lt;ref name=Tein2013&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Tein I | title = Disorders of fatty acid oxidation | journal = Handbook of Clinical Neurology | volume = 113 | pages = 1675–88 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23622388 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-444-59565-2.00035-6 | isbn = 9780444595652 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 18 have been associated with human disease as [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn errors of metabolism]].

== History of the Concept ==

''Biofact'' was introduced as early as 2001 by the German philosopher [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicole C. Karafyllis: ''Biologisch, natürlich, nachhaltig. Philosophische Aspekte des Naturzugangs im 21. Jahrhundert.'' Tuebingen: A. Francke Publisher; chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt; although her book ''Biofakte'' published in 2003 is commonly used as reference for the introduction of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole C. Karafyllis (Hg.), ''Biofakte. Versuch über den Menschen zwischen Artefakt und Lebewesen'', Mentis: Paderborn 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Karafyllis, the word '''biofact''' first appeared in a German article (entitled 'Biofakt und Artefakt') in 1943, written by the Austrian protozoologist Bruno M. Klein.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Maria Klein: Artefakt und Biofakt, in: Mikrokosmos 1943/44&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing both microscopy and philosophy, Klein named a [[Biofact (biology)|biofact]] something that is a visible dead product emerging from a living being while this being is still alive (e.g. a shell). However, Klein's distinction operated with the difference biotic/abiotic and dead/alive, not with nature/technology and growth/man-made. For her part, Karafyllis described biofact as a [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic concept]] that allows the comparison between nature and [[technology]] in the domain of the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Genetics &amp; Society: Mapping the New Genomic Era|last=Atkinson|first=Paul|last2=Glasner|first2=Peter|last3=Lock|first3=Margaret|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=0203927389|location=Oxon|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly 

== Philosophy of the Concept ==

With the term ''biofact'', Karafyllis wants to emphasize that living entities can be highly artificial due to methods deriving from agriculture, gardening (e.g. breeding) or [[biotechnology]] (e.g. [[genetic engineering]], [[cloning]]).  Biofacts show signatures of [[culture]] and technique.
Primarily, the concept aims to argue against the common philosophical tradition to summarize all kinds of living beings under the category [[nature]]. The concept ''biofact'' questions if the phenomenon of growth is and was a secure candidate for differentiating between nature and technology.

For the [[philosophy of technology]] the questions arise if a) biotechnology and [[agriculture]] should not be an integral part of ''reflexion'', thereby adding new insights to the common focus on the [[machine]] and the artifact, and if b) established concepts of technique and technology which stress artificiality should not be modified. Karafyllis regards the inclusion of biofacts into a theory of techniques as a chance, to reformulate classic concepts of [[design]] and [[construction]] for defining the making of artifacts. In her view, biofacts depend on the method of provocation.&lt;ref&gt;Karafyllis, N. C.: Provokation als Methode der biotechnischen Evolution, in: Volker Gerhardt, Klaus Lucas and Günter Stock (Eds.): ''Evolution. Theorie, Formen und Konsequenzen eines Paradigmas in Natur, Technik und Kultur''. Berlin: Akademie Verlag 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[philosophy of nature]], biofacts highlight a need to clarify if nature is self-explanatory in every case. [[Biophilosophy]] is challenged to newly reflect upon the categories organism and [[living being]].&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Schark: ''Lebewesen versus Dinge'', De Gruyter 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[philosophy of science]], approaches are challenged which only focus on the category thing (or epistemic thing) without historizing the technicality, mediality and materiality of its emerging as a living object. For the [[sociology of science]] the biofact concept is fruitful to discuss the exclusiveness of scientific knowledge (the role of the [[expert]]) while making scientific objects which are released into the [[lifeworld]] or public sphere.  Particularly because the biofact concept deals with the [[phenomenon]] of growth and the establishing of a [[self]], it is also influential in the philosophical disciplines phenomenology, [[anthropology]] and [[ontology]]. It was [[Jürgen Habermas]] who recently stressed the anthropological consequences if mankind gives up the differentiation of "coming into being" and "making".&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas: ''Die Zukunft der menschlichen Natur'', Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artifacts are artificial, i.e. man-made objects. Contrary to biofacts, they cannot be found in nature. Therefore, biofacts demarcate an ontological intersection. They are partially man-made, but growing. Like artifacts, they have been made for a certain [[utility]]. Biofacts can be seen as biotic artifacts which show their character as hybrids in multifold perspectives.

The term is also enabling philosophers to criticize some concepts in [[technoscience]], where the union of scientific knowledge about nature and the technical creation of technonature is seen as progress in the political sense.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bruno Latour: ''Politics of Natur. How to bring the Sciences into Democracy'', Harvard University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been adopted in the new [[BioArt]], not rarely without using its critical impacts.

As Karafyllis complemented the growth and reproduction of organisms with technical entities, she established a typology of different kinds of organisms according to their uses and these are:

* Natural life form
* Unaltered biofacts
* Reshaped biofacts
* Genetically reproduced biofacts
* Genetically modified biofacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Synthetic Biology: Metaphors, Worldviews, Ethics, and Law|last=Boldt|first=Joachim|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783658109875|location=Wiesbaden|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9287">The '''British Alpine Hannibal Expedition''' was an [[experimental archeology]] event that took place in 1959. British engineer John Hoyte led an expedition that tried to reenact aspects of [[Hannibal]]'s legendary crossing of the [[Alps]] during the [[Second Punic War]] in 218 BCE. The group successfully took the female Asian elephant ''Jumbo'', provided by a zoo in [[Turin]], from France over the [[Col du Mont Cenis]] into Italy.

== Background ==
[[File:Hannibal route of invasion.gif|thumb|One possible invasion route proposed for Hannibal's army]]

After the Carthaginian defeat in the [[First Punic War]] of 264–241 BCE, [[Hamilcar Barca]] secured an extensive territory in the [[Iberian peninsula]] for [[Carthage]]. At the beginning of the [[Second Punic War]] in 218 BCE, his son [[Hannibal]] took an army of perhaps 50,000 men and 37 [[war elephants]] from [[Hispania]] (modern-day Spain) to Italy, where he led a 15-year campaign against [[Roman Republic|Rome]]. Hannibal avoided the coastal route, and took his army over the Alps. His march has been described by ancient historians [[Polybius]] and [[Livy]]. The exact route, however, has been subject of long but inconclusive scholarly discourse.&lt;ref name=Jia-stanford-2007/&gt; In his 1955  book ''Alps and elephants: Hannibal's march'', [[Gavin de Beer]] lists 12 possible candidates from 30 different books.&lt;ref name=time-1959/&gt;

== The expedition ==

In 1955, ''[[The Times]]'' published a debate about the route Hannibal might have taken over the Alps. This debate came to the attention of  John Hoyte, then an engineering student at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;!-- Note that  Boser-archeology-2007 mistakenly claims Oxford, however, the other sources, including Hoyte himself in the Stanford University Podcast, agree on Cambridge--&gt;&lt;ref name=Kahn-seattletimes-2009/&gt; Hoyte had an interest in both history and [[mountain climbing]], and spent the summer of 1956 with friends hiking the Alps and comparing possible routes to the ancient descriptions. The group came to the conclusion that the [[Col de Clapier]] was the most likely pass, an opinion still supported by some modern historians.&lt;ref name=Jia-stanford-2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kahn-seattletimes-2009/&gt;

A few years later, a friend suggested to test this theory with an actual elephant. Hoyte wrote letters to the British consuls in [[Lyon]], France, [[Geneva]], Switzerland, and Turin, enquiring about the possibility of obtaining an elephant for the experiment, but without a serious expectation of success. However, the Turin Zoo had just acquired a female Asian elephant, ''Jumbo'', who was trained as a [[circus]] animal. The owner of the zoo volunteered ''Jumbo'' and became the first sponsor of the expedition.  Hoyte put together a team of 8 people, including [[Richard Jolly]] as the expedition secretary and Colonel John Hickman, [[Lecturer]] (later [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]]) in Veterinary Surgery at the University of Cambridge Veterinary School, who had gained experience with elephants during [[World War II]] in [[Burma]].&lt;ref name=Jolly-ids/&gt;&lt;ref name=LB-life-1959/&gt;&lt;ref name=Witten-science20-2009/&gt;&lt;!-- Hickman is only identified by name in the Stanford lecture by Hunt and Hoyte currently in the EL section, but this fact should be uncontroversial --&gt; The group obtained insurance for ''Jumbo'' from [[Lloyd's of London]] and further sponsorship from [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]], which later published a 7-page photo report.&lt;ref name=LB-life-1959/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoyte-calling-2010/&gt;
[[Image:Col de Clapier (by Edward Boenig) 01.jpg|thumb|The originally planned route led over the ''Col de Clapier'']]
The expedition started in late July 1959 in [[Montmelian]], France. It followed the valley of the [[Arc (Savoie)|Arc river]] and then ascended towards the Col de Clapier. However, the route up to the pass had become narrowed and dangerous due to [[rockfall]].&lt;ref name=Witten-science20-2009/&gt; The group retracted down into the valley and crossed the [[Col du Mont Cenis]],&lt;ref name=LB-life-1959/&gt;&lt;ref name=Witten-science20-2009/&gt; another pass suggested for Hannibal's route by none less than French emperor [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref name=time-1959/&gt; After 10 days of travel, the expedition successfully "invaded" [[Susa (Italy)|Susa]] in Italy.&lt;ref name=Witten-science20-2009/&gt;

The members of the expedition originally planned to call the 5,700 pound (2.6 t) elephant ''Hannibella'', however, the animal could not be made to respond to the new name and thus remained ''Jumbo''.&lt;ref name=Kahn-seattletimes-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Witten-science20-2009/&gt; ''Jumbo'' was 11 years old and equipped with leather boots and knee pads for the most treacherous passages. A specially made coat was provided to keep her warm.&lt;ref name=LB-life-1959/&gt; Despite a diet consisting of {{convert|150|lb|kg}} of hay, {{convert|50|lb|kg}} of apples, {{convert|40|lb|kg}} of bread, {{convert|20|lb|kg}} of carrots, and a vitamin B supplement per day, she lost an estimated {{convert|300|lb|kg}} during the first 4 days of the trip,&lt;ref name=time-1959/&gt; and nearly {{convert|500|lb|kg}} in total. On arrival in Italy, she consumed cake and a [[Wine bottle|Magnum bottle]] of [[Chianti]].&lt;ref name=LB-life-1959/&gt;

In 1960, Hoyte published a report on the expedition as ''Trunk Road for Hannibal: With an Elephant Over the Alps''.&lt;ref name="Hammond-times-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoyte-bles-1960/&gt; Expedition member Cynthia Pilkington published the book "Elephant Over the Alps" in 1961, telling the story of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pilkington|first1=Cynthia|title=Elephant over the Alps|date=1961|publisher=Macmillan|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''challenge''' can serve as a dare or an exhortation, motivating a person or persons by "[a]n invitation or summons to a trial or contest of any kind" and thus to "a difficult or demanding task, esp[ecially] one seen as a test of one's abilities or character".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite OED | challenge}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, speakers or writers can use challenges to [[motivation | motivate]] - to convince people "to perform an action they otherwise [might] not".&lt;ref&gt; 
Compare https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/challenge
&lt;/ref&gt;
A challenge can thus become a [[Rhetorical device | tool]] of [[rhetoric]]: a '''rhetorical challenge'''.&lt;ref&gt;

[...] Recall how one of the more notable traces of Morris's influence on the speech was his organization  of an anaphoric structure based on the command, 'I challenge.' Through this device, the speaker could shift from describing issues into a mode of exhortation, epitomized by the repetition of 'I challenge' twenty-five times, and its context-specific entailments - for example, 'I urge,' 'I invite,' and so on.

White dwarfs resist [[gravitational collapse]] primarily through [[electron degeneracy pressure]] (compare [[main sequence]] stars, which resist collapse through [[Pressure#Pressure of an ideal gas|thermal pressure]]). The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction.  Consequently, a white dwarf with a mass greater than the limit is subject to further gravitational collapse, [[Stellar evolution|evolving]] into a different type of [[Compact star|stellar remnant]], such as a [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]].  Those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs.&lt;ref name = DarkMatter&gt;Sean Carroll, Ph.D., Caltech, 2007, The Teaching Company, ''Dark Matter, Dark Energy: The Dark Side of the Universe'', Guidebook Part 2 page 44, Accessed Oct. 7, 2013, "...Chandrasekhar limit: The maximum mass of a white dwarf star, about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. Above this mass, the gravitational pull becomes too great, and the star must collapse to a neutron star or black hole..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The limit was named after [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], the Indian [[astrophysicist]] who improved upon the accuracy of the calculation in 1930, at the age of 20, in [[India]] by calculating the limit for a polytrope model of a star in hydrostatic equilibrium, and comparing his limit to the earlier limit found by [[Edmund Clifton Stoner|E. C. Stoner]] for a  uniform density star.  Importantly, the existence of a limit, based on the conceptual breakthrough of  combining relativity with  Fermi degeneracy, was indeed first established  in separate  papers published by [[Wilhelm Anderson]] and E. C. Stoner in 1929.  The limit was initially ignored by the community of scientists because such a limit would logically require the existence of [[black hole]]s, which were considered a scientific impossibility at the time. That the roles of Stoner and Anderson are often forgotten in the astronomy community has been noted.&lt;ref&gt;Eric G. Blackman, "Giants of physics found white-dwarf mass limits", [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006Natur.440..148B ''Nature'' 440, 148 (2006)] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:WhiteDwarf mass-radius en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Radius–mass relations for a model white dwarf. The green curve uses the general pressure law for an ideal [[Fermi gas]], while the blue curve is for a non-relativistic ideal Fermi gas. The black line marks the [[ultrarelativistic limit]].]]

Electron degeneracy pressure is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] effect arising from the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Since [[electron]]s are [[fermion]]s, no two electrons can be in the same state, so not all electrons can be in the minimum-energy level. Rather, electrons must occupy a [[Electronic band structure|band]] of [[energy levels]]. Compression of the electron gas increases the number of electrons in a given volume and raises the maximum energy level in the occupied band. Therefore, the energy of the electrons increases on compression, so pressure must be exerted on the electron gas to compress it, producing electron degeneracy pressure. With sufficient compression, electrons are forced into nuclei in the process of [[electron capture]], relieving the pressure.

In the nonrelativistic case, electron degeneracy pressure gives rise to an [[equation of state]] of the form {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|5|3}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|P}} is the [[pressure]], {{mvar|ρ}} is the [[mass density]], and {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a constant.  Solving the hydrostatic equation leads to a model white dwarf that is a [[polytrope]] of index {{sfrac|3|2}} – and therefore has radius inversely proportional to the cube root of its mass, and volume inversely proportional to its mass.&lt;ref name="chandra3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chandrasekhar | first1 = S. | year = 1931 | title = The Density of White Dwarf Stars | url = | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 592–596 | doi=10.1080/14786443109461710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the mass of a model white dwarf increases, the typical energies to which degeneracy pressure forces the electrons are no longer negligible relative to their rest masses. The velocities of the electrons approach the speed of light, and [[special relativity]] must be taken into account. In the strongly relativistic limit, the equation of state takes the form {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|4|3}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This yields a polytrope of index 3, which has a total mass, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;limit&lt;/sub&gt;}} say, depending only on {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="chandra4"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1931 | title =  The Maximum Mass of Ideal White Dwarfs| doi = 10.1086/143324 | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 81–82 | bibcode=1931ApJ....74...81C | last1 = Chandrasekhar | first1 = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a fully relativistic treatment, the equation of state used interpolates between the equations {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|5|3}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} for small {{mvar|ρ}} and {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|4|3}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} for large {{mvar|ρ}}. When this is done, the model radius still decreases with mass, but becomes zero at {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;limit&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This is the Chandrasekhar limit.&lt;ref name="chandra2"/&gt;  The curves of radius against mass for the non-relativistic and relativistic models are shown in the graph. They are colored blue and green, respectively. {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} has been set equal to 2.

(43)&lt;/sup&gt; gives the following expression, based on the [[equation of state]] for an ideal [[Fermi gas]]:
:&lt;math&gt; M_{\rm limit} = \frac{\omega_3^0 \sqrt{3\pi}}{2}\left ( \frac{\hbar c}{G}\right )^\frac32\frac{1}{(\mu_\text{e} m_\text{H})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

*{{mvar|ħ}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]]
*{{mvar|c}} is the [[speed of light]]
*{{mvar|G}} is the [[gravitational constant]]
*{{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the average [[molecular weight]] per electron, which depends upon the chemical composition of the star.
*{{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the mass of the [[hydrogen]] [[atom]].
*{{math|''ω''{{su|b=3|p=0}} ≈ 2.018236}} is a constant connected with the solution to the [[Lane–Emden equation]].
As {{math|{{sqrt|''ħc''/''G''}}}} is the [[Planck mass]], the limit is of the order of
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_\text{Pl}^3}{m_\text{H}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

A more accurate value of the limit than that given by this simple model requires adjusting for various factors, including electrostatic interactions between the electrons and nuclei and effects caused by nonzero temperature.&lt;ref name="timmes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Timmes | first1 = F.

==History==
In 1926, the British [[physicist]] [[Ralph H. Fowler]] observed that the relationship between the density, energy, and temperature of white dwarfs could be explained by viewing them as a gas of nonrelativistic, non-interacting electrons and nuclei that obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fowler | first1 = R.

A series of papers published between 1931 and 1935 had its beginning on a trip from India to England in 1930, where the Indian physicist [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] worked on the calculation of the statistics of a degenerate Fermi gas.&lt;ref name="nasbio"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/schandrasekhar.html Chandrasekhar's biographical memoir at the National Academy of Sciences], web page, accessed 12-01-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In these papers, Chandrasekhar solved the [[hydrostatic equation]] together with the nonrelativistic Fermi gas [[equation of state]],&lt;ref name="chandra3"/&gt; and also treated the case of a relativistic Fermi gas, giving rise to the value of the limit shown above.&lt;ref name="chandra4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chandra2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chandra1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chandrasekhar | first1 = S. | year = 1934 | title = Stellar Configurations with degenerate Cores | journal = The Observatory | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 373–377 | bibcode=1934Obs....57..373C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chandrasekhar reviews this work in his Nobel Prize lecture.&lt;ref name="chandranobel"/&gt;  This value was also computed in 1932 by the Soviet physicist [[Lev Davidovich Landau]],&lt;ref&gt;On the Theory of Stars, in ''Collected Papers of L.

'''1''' (1932), 285.&lt;/ref&gt; who, however, did not apply it to white dwarfs.

Chandrasekhar's work on the limit aroused controversy, owing to the opposition of the British [[astrophysicist]] [[Arthur Eddington]]. Eddington was aware that the existence of [[black hole]]s was theoretically possible, and also realized that the existence of the limit made their formation possible. However, he was unwilling to accept that this could happen. After a talk by Chandrasekhar on the limit in 1935, he replied:

{{quote|The star has to go on radiating and radiating and contracting and contracting until, I suppose, it gets down to a few km radius, when gravity becomes strong enough to hold in the radiation, and the star can at last find peace. … I think there should be a law of Nature to prevent a star from behaving in this absurd way!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 1935 | title = Meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, Friday, 1935 January 11 | journal = The Observatory | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 33–41 | bibcode=1935Obs....58...33.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eddington's proposed solution to the perceived problem was to modify relativistic mechanics so as to make the law {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|5|3}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} universally applicable, even for large {{mvar|ρ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eddington | first1 = A.

Miller]]'s biography of Chandrasekhar.&lt;ref name="eos"/&gt;  In Miller's view:

{{quote|Chandra's discovery might well have transformed and accelerated developments in both physics and astrophysics in the 1930s. Instead, Eddington's heavy-handed intervention lent weighty support to the conservative community astrophysicists, who steadfastly refused even to consider the idea that stars might collapse to nothing. As a result, Chandra's work was almost forgotten.&lt;ref name="eos"/&gt;{{rp|150}}}}

==Applications==
The core of a star is kept from collapsing by the heat generated by the [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of lighter [[chemical element|elements]] into heavier ones. At various stages of [[stellar evolution]], the nuclei required for this process are exhausted, and the core collapses, causing it to become denser and hotter. A critical situation arises when [[iron]] accumulates in the core, since iron nuclei are incapable of generating further energy through fusion. If the core becomes sufficiently dense, electron degeneracy pressure will play a significant part in stabilizing it against gravitational collapse.&lt;ref name="evo2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woosley | first1 = S.

If a main-sequence star is not too massive (less than approximately 8 [[solar mass]]es), it eventually sheds enough mass to form a white dwarf having mass below the Chandrasekhar limit, which consists of the former core of the star. For more-massive stars, electron degeneracy pressure does not keep the iron core from collapsing to very great density, leading to formation of a [[neutron star]], [[black hole]], or, speculatively, a [[quark star]].  (For very massive, low-[[metallicity]] stars, it is also possible that instabilities destroy the star completely.)&lt;ref name="ifmr1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koester | first1 = D. | last2 = Reimers | first2 = D. | year = 1996 | title = White dwarfs in open clusters.

[[Type Ia supernova]]e derive their energy from runaway fusion of the nuclei in the interior of a [[white dwarf]]. This fate may befall [[carbon]]–[[oxygen]] white dwarfs that accrete matter from a companion [[giant star]], leading to a steadily increasing mass. As the white dwarf's mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, its central density increases, and, as a result of [[compression (physical)|compression]]al heating, its temperature also increases. This eventually ignites [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, leading to an immediate [[carbon detonation]], which disrupts the star and causes the supernova.&lt;ref name="sniamodels"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hillebrandt | first1 = Wolfgang | last2 = Niemeyer | first2 = Jens C. | year = 2000 | title = Type IA Supernova Explosion Models | journal = Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 191–230 | doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.38.1.191 | bibcode=2000ARA&amp;A..38..191H|arxiv = astro-ph/0006305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, §5.1.2&lt;/sup&gt;

A strong indication of the reliability of Chandrasekhar's formula is that the [[absolute magnitude]]s of supernovae of Type Ia are all approximately the same; at maximum luminosity, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;}} is approximately −19.3, with a [[standard deviation]] of no more than 0.3.&lt;ref name="sniamodels"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, (1)&lt;/sup&gt;  A [[Confidence interval|1-sigma interval]] therefore represents a factor of less than 2 in luminosity. This seems to indicate that all type Ia supernovae convert approximately the same amount of mass to energy.

==Super-Chandrasekhar mass supernovae==
{{main|SN 2003fg|l1=Champagne Supernova}}
In April 2003, the [[Supernova Legacy Survey]] observed a type Ia supernova, designated [[SNLS-03D3bb]], in a galaxy approximately 4&amp;nbsp;billion [[light year]]s away. According to a group of astronomers at the [[University of Toronto]] and elsewhere, the observations of this supernova are best explained by assuming that it arose from a white dwarf that grew to twice the mass of the [[Sun]] before exploding. They believe that the star, dubbed the "[[SN 2003fg|Champagne Supernova]]" by University of Oklahoma astronomer David R. Branch, may have been spinning so fast that a centrifugal tendency allowed it to exceed the limit. Alternatively, the supernova may have resulted from the merger of two white dwarfs, so that the limit was only violated momentarily. Nevertheless, they point out that this observation poses a challenge to the use of type Ia supernovae as [[standard candles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-09/dbnl-twt092006.php The weirdest Type Ia supernova yet], LBL press release, web page accessed 13-I-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Champagne_Supernova_Challenges_Ideas_about_How_Supernovae_Work_999.html Champagne Supernova Challenges Ideas about How Supernovae Work], web page, spacedaily.com, accessed 13-I-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv = astro-ph/0609616 | doi=10.1038/nature05103 | volume=443 | title=The type Ia supernova SNLS-03D3bb from a super-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf star | year=2006 | journal=Nature | pages=308–311 | last1 = Howell | first1 = D. Andrew|bibcode = 2006Natur.443..308H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the observation of the Champagne Supernova in 2003, more very bright type Ia [[supernova]]e have been observed that are thought to have originated from [[white dwarf]]s whose masses exceeded the Chandrasekhar limit. These include [[SN 2006gz]], [[SN 2007if]] and [[SN 2009dc]].&lt;ref name="Machisu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hachisu|first=Izumi|author2=Kato, M.|title=A single degenerate progenitor model for type Ia supernovae highly exceeding the Chandrasekhar mass limit|bibcode=2012ApJ...744...69H|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/744/1/69|arxiv=1106.3510|volume=744|issue=1|year=2012|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|pages=76–79 (Article ID 69)|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs that gave rise to these supernovae are believed to have had masses up to 2.4–2.8 [[solar mass]]es.&lt;ref name="Machisu" /&gt; One way to potentially explain the problem of the Champagne Supernova was considering it the result of an aspherical explosion of a white dwarf. However, spectropolarimetric observations of [[SN 2009dc]] showed it had a [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] smaller than 0.3, making the large asphericity theory unlikely.&lt;ref name="Machisu" /&gt;

==Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit==

After a supernova explosion, a [[neutron star]] may be left behind. These objects are even more compact than white dwarfs and are also supported, in part, by degeneracy pressure. A neutron star, however, is so massive and compressed that electrons and protons have combined to form neutrons, and the star is thus supported by neutron degeneracy pressure (as well as short-range repulsive neutron-neutron interactions mediated by the [[strong force]]) instead of electron degeneracy pressure.  The limiting value for neutron star mass, analogous to the Chandrasekhar limit, is known as the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]].

{{cosmology}}

The term '''''cosmic variance''''' is the [[Statistics|statistical]] [[uncertainty]] inherent in observations of the universe at extreme distances. It has three different but closely related meanings:
* It is sometimes used, incorrectly, to mean [[sample variance]] - the difference between different finite samples of the same parent population. Such differences follow a [[Poissonian distribution]], and in this case the term [[sample variance]] should be used instead.
* It is sometimes used, mainly by cosmologists, to mean the uncertainty because we can only observe one realization of all the possible observable universes. For example, we can only observe one [[Cosmic Microwave Background]], so the measured positions of the peaks in the Cosmic Microwave Background spectrum, integrated over the visible sky,  are limited by the fact that only one  spectrum is observable from Earth. The observable universe viewed from another Galaxy will have the peaks in slightly different places, while remaining consistent with the same physical laws, inflation, etc. This second meaning may be regarded as a special case of the third meaning.
* The most widespread use, to which the rest of this article refers, reflects the fact that measurements are affected by cosmic large-scale structure, so a measurement of any region of sky (viewed from Earth) may differ from a measurement of a different region of sky (also viewed from Earth) by an amount that may be much greater than the sample variance.

This most widespread use of the term is based on the idea that it is only possible to observe part of the universe at one particular time, so it is difficult to make statistical statements about [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] on the scale of the entire universe,&lt;ref name="aspj"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1538-4357/600/2/L171/17416.html | author=Somerville | title=Cosmic Variance in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey | journal=The [[Astrophysical Journal]] Letters  | year=2004 | volume=600 | issue=2 | pages=L171–L174 | doi=10.1086/378628 | last2=Lee | first2=Kyoungsoo | last3=Ferguson | first3=Henry C. | last4=Gardner | first4=Jonathan P. | last5=Moustakas | first5=Leonidas A. | last6=Giavalisco | first6=Mauro|arxiv = astro-ph/0309071 |bibcode = 2004ApJ...600L.171S |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aas"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v37n4/aas207/1366.htm|title=Quantifying the Effects of Cosmic Variance Using the NOAO Deep-Wide Field Survey|accessdate=September 18, 2007|publisher=[[American Astronomical Society]]|year=2006|author=M.S.

== Background ==
The standard [[big bang]] model is usually supplemented with [[cosmic inflation]]. In inflationary models, the observer only sees a tiny fraction of the whole universe, much less than a billionth (1/10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) of the volume of the [[universe]] postulated in inflation.  So the observable universe (the so-called [[particle horizon]] of the universe) is the result of processes that follow some general [[physical laws]], including [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]]. Some of these processes are [[random]]: for example, the distribution of [[galaxies]] throughout the universe can only be described [[statistics|statistically]] and cannot be derived from first principles.

== Philosophical issues ==
This raises [[philosophy|philosophical]] problems:  suppose that random physical processes happen on length scales both smaller than and bigger than the horizon. A physical process (such as an amplitude of a primordial [[wiktionary:perturbation|perturbation]] in density) that happens on the horizon scale only gives us one observable realization. A physical process on a larger scale gives us zero observable realizations. A physical process on a slightly smaller scale gives us a small number of realizations.

In the case of only one realization it is difficult to draw statistical conclusions about its significance. For example, if the underlying model of a physical process implies that the observed property should occur only 1% of the time, does that really mean that the model is excluded? Consider the physical model of the citizenship of human beings in the early 21st century, where about 30% are [[India]]n and [[China|Chinese]] citizens, about 5% are [[United States|American]] citizens, about 1% are [[France|French]] citizens, and so on. For an observer who has only one observation (of his/her own citizenship) and who happens to be French and cannot make any external observations, the model can be rejected at the 99% significance level. Yet the external observers with more information unavailable to the first observer, know that the model is correct.

In other words, even if the bit of the universe observed is the result of a statistical process, the observer can only view one realization of that process, so our observation is statistically insignificant for saying much about the model, unless the observer is careful to include the [[variance]]. This variance is called the ''cosmic variance'' and is separate from other sources of experimental error: a very accurate measurement of only one value drawn from a [[probability distribution|distribution]] still leaves considerable uncertainty about the underlying model. Variance is normally plotted separately from other sources of uncertainty. Because it is necessarily a large fraction of the signal, workers must be very careful in interpreting the statistical significance of measurements on scales close to the [[particle horizon|horizon]].

In [[physical cosmology]], the common way of dealing with this on the horizon scale and on slightly sub-horizon scales (where the number of occurrences is greater than one but still quite small), is to explicitly include the [[variance]] of very small statistical samples ([[Poisson distribution]]) when calculating [[uncertainty|uncertainties]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Analysis of the Kamionkowski-Loeb method of reducing cosmic variance with CMB polarization|publisher=Department of Astrophysics, Oxford / Smithsonian/NASA Astronomy Abstract Service|year=2004|author=Portsmouth, Jamie|bibcode=2004PhRvD..70f3504P|arxiv = astro-ph/0402173 |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.70.063504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important in describing the low [[spherical harmonic|multipoles]] of the [[cosmic microwave background]] and has been the source of much controversy in the cosmology community since the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] and [[WMAP]] measurements.

== Similar problems ==
A similar problem is faced by [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]]. Just as cosmologists have a [[statistical sample|sample size]] of one universe, biologists have a sample size of one fossil record. The problem is closely related to the [[anthropic principle]].

Another problem of limited sample sizes in astronomy, here practical rather than essential, is in the [[Titius–Bode law]] on spacing of satellites in an orbital system. Originally observed for the Solar System, the difficulty in observing other solar systems has limited data to test this.

''' Design history ''' is the study of objects of design in their historical and stylistic contexts.

With a broad definition, the contexts of design history include the social, the cultural, the economic, the political, the technical and the aesthetic. Design history has as its objects of study all designed objects including those of [[architecture]], [[fashion]], [[crafts]], [[interiors]], [[textiles]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]] and [[product design]].

Design history has had to incorporate criticism of the 'heroic' structure of its discipline, in response to the establishment of [[material culture]], much as [[art history]] has had to respond to [[visual culture]], (although visual culture has been able to broaden the subject area of art history through the incorporation of the televisual, film and new media). Design history has done this by shifting its focus towards the acts of production and consumption.

== Design history as a component of British practice-based courses ==

Design history also exists as a component of many practice-based courses.

The teaching and study of design history within art and design programs in Britain are one of the results of the National Advisory Council on Art Education in the 1960s. Among its aims was making art and design education a legitimate academic activity, to which ends a historical perspective was introduced. This necessitated the employment or ‘buying in’ of specialists from art history disciplines, leading to a particular style of delivery: “Art historians taught in the only way that art historians knew how to teach;  they switched off the lights, turned on the slide projector, showed slides of art and design objects, discussed and evaluated them and asked (art and design) students to write essays – according to the scholarly conventions of academia”.&lt;ref&gt;Raein, M. (2005). "Integration of studio and theory in the teaching of graphic design." Art, Design &amp; Communication in Higher Education 3(3): 163–174&lt;/ref&gt;

The most obvious effect of the traditional approach design history as sequential, in which X begat Y and Y begat Z. This has pedagogical implications in that the realization that assessment requires a fact-based regurgitation of received knowledge leads students to ignore discussions of the situations surrounding a design’s creation and reception and to focus instead on simple facts such as who designed what and when.

This 'heroic/aesthetic' view – the idea that there are a few great designers who should be studied and revered unquestioningly – arguably instills an unrealistic view of the design profession. Although the design industry has been complicit in promoting the heroic view of history, the establishment of the UK government of [[Creative &amp; Cultural Skills]] has led to calls for design courses to be made less 'academic' and more attuned to the 'needs' of the industry. Design history, as a component of design courses, is under increasing threat in the UK at least and it has been argued that its survival depends on an increased focus on the study of the processes and effects of design rather than the lives of designers themselves.

Ultimately it appears that design history for practice-based courses is rapidly becoming a branch of social and cultural studies, leaving behind its art historical roots. This has led to a great deal of debate as the two approaches forge distinct pedagogical approaches and philosophies.

=== Debates over the merits of different approaches to teaching design history on practice-based courses ===

The debate over the best way to approach the teaching of design history to practice-based students is often heated, but it is notable that the biggest push to adopt a 'realistic' approach (i.e. non-hero-based, analysing the production and consumption of design that would otherwise be viewed as ephemeral) comes from teachers delivering these programmes, while critics are predominantly those who teach 'pure' design history courses.

The biggest criticism of the 'realistic' approach appears to be that it imposes anonymity on designers, while the counter argument is that the vast majority of designers ''are'' anonymous and that it is the uses and users of design that are more important.

The research literature suggests that, contrary to critics' predictions of the death of design history, this realistic approach is beneficial. Baldwin and McLean at the University of Brighton (now at the University of Dundee and Edinburgh College of Art respectively) reported attendance figures for courses using this model rising dramatically,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, J and McLean, S "Abandoning History: delivering historical and critical studies to practice-based students" at the New Views conference, LCC 29 October 2005. [http://www.jonathanbaldwin.co.uk/assets/AbandoningHistory.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and improved interest in the subject, as did Rain at Central St. Martin's. This compares with the often-reported low attendance and low grades of practice-based students facing the 'death by slideshow' model.

{{Human growth and development}}

'''Human development''' is the process of growth to maturity. The process begins with fertilisation, where an egg released from the [[ovary]] of a female is penetrated by [[sperm]]. The egg then lodges in the [[uterus]], where an [[embryo]] and later [[fetus]] develop until [[birth]]. Growth and development occur after birth, and include both physical and psychological development, influenced by genetic, hormonal, environmental and other factors. Development and growth continue throughout life, through [[childhood]], [[adolescence]], and through [[adulthood]] to [[senility]], and are referred to as the process of [[ageing]].

==Before birth==
{{Main|Prenatal development}}
Development before birth, or '''prenatal development''' ({{ety|la|natalis|relating to birth}}) is the process in which an [[embryo]] and later [[fetus]] develops during [[gestation]]. Prenatal development starts with fertilization, the first stage in [[embryogenesis]] which continues in fetal development until [[birth]].

===Fertilization===
{{Main|Fertilization}}
[[Image:Sperm-egg.jpg|tbhhjgb|right|thumb|Sperm fertilizing an egg]] 
Fertilization occurs when the sperm successfully enters the ovum's membrane. The chromosomes of the sperm combine with those of the egg to form a single cell, called a zygote, and the germinal stage of prenatal development commences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherk |first=Stephanie Dionne |title=Prenatal Development |url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Children's Health, 2006 |publisher=Gale |accessdate=6 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081856/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |archivedate=1 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization, through the development of the early embryo, up until implantation. The germinal stage is over at about 10 days of gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=germinal stage|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/germinal+stage|work=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.|publisher=Elsevier.|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[zygote]] contains a full complement of [[genetic material]] and develops into the embryo. Briefly, embryonic developments have four stages: the morula stage, the blastula stage, the gastrula stage, and the neurula stage. Prior to implantation, the [[embryo]] remains in a protein shell, the [[zona pellucida]], and undergoes a series of cell divisions, called mitosis. A week after fertilization the embryo still has not grown in size, but hatches from the zona pellucida and adheres to the lining of the mother's [[uterus]]. This induces a [[decidual reaction]], wherein the uterine cells proliferate and surround the embryo thus causing it to become embedded within the uterine tissue. The embryo, meanwhile, proliferates and develops both into embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue, the latter forming the [[fetal membranes]] and the [[placenta]].  In humans, the embryo is referred to as a [[fetus]] in the later stages of prenatal development.  The transition from embryo to fetus is arbitrarily defined as occurring 8 weeks after fertilization. In comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a set of progressively developing internal organs. A nearly identical process occurs in other species.

===Embryonic development===
{{main|Human embryogenesis}}
[[Human embryogenesis]] refers to the development and formation of the human [[embryo]]. It is characterised by the process of [[cell division]] and [[cellular differentiation]] of the [[embryo]] that occurs during the early stages of [[Human development (biology)|development]]. In biological terms, human development entails growth from a one-celled [[zygote]] to an adult [[human being]]. [[Fertilisation]] occurs when the [[sperm]] cell successfully enters and fuses with an [[egg cell]] ([[ovum]]). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of [[prenatal development]] commences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherk |first=Stephanie Dionne |title=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Children's Health, 2006 |publisher=Gale |accessdate=6 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081856/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |archivedate=1 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Embryogenesis covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a [[fetus]].
 
The germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] is completed in the [[uterus]]. The germinal stage takes around 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=germinal stage|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/germinal+stage|work=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.|publisher=Elsevier.|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]]. A [[blastocyst]] is then formed and implanted in the [[uterus]]. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of [[gastrulation]], when the three [[germ layers]] of the embryo form in a process called [[histogenesis]], and the processes of [[neurulation]] and [[organogenesis]] follow.

In comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in [[gene expression]], [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]]. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among [[chordate]]s.

===Fetal development===
{{main|Fetus}}
A '''fetus''' is a stage in the human development considered to begin nine weeks after [[fertilization]].&lt;ref name="nursing"&gt;Klossner, N. Jayne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=B47OVg25g-QC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=fetal+stage+begins&amp;source=web&amp;ots=dqQjWN-2jU&amp;sig=-KVkuIJggNo1T_gV6AHkcc58xyI&amp;hl=en Introductory Maternity Nursing] (2005): "The fetal stage is from the beginning of the 9th week after fertilization and continues until birth"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringpregnancy/fetaldevelopment1.htm|title=First Trimester - American Pregnancy Association|author=|date=1 May 2012|website=americanpregnancy.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423022520/http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringpregnancy/fetaldevelopment1.htm|archivedate=23 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biological terms, however, prenatal development is a continuum, with many defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus. A fetus is also characterized by the presence of all the major body organs, though they will not yet be fully developed and functional and some not yet situated in their final location.

===Maternal influences===
{{See also|Placenta}}
The fetus and embryo develop within the [[uterus]], an organ that sits within the pelvis of the [[mother]]. The process the mother experiences whilst carrying the fetus or embryo is referred to as [[pregnancy]]. The [[placenta]] connects the developing [[fetus]] to the [[Uterus|uterine]] wall to allow nutrient uptake, thermo-regulation, waste elimination, and gas exchange via the mother's blood supply; to fight against internal infection; and to produce hormones which support pregnancy. The placenta provides oxygen and nutrients to growing fetuses and removes waste products from the fetus's blood. The placenta attaches to the wall of the uterus, and the fetus's [[umbilical cord]] develops from the placenta. These organs connect the mother and the fetus.  Placentas are a defining characteristic of [[placental mammal]]s, but are also found in [[marsupials]] and some non-mammals with varying levels of development.&lt;ref name="Pou92"&gt;Pough ''et al.'' 1992. Herpetology: Third Edition. Pearson Prentice Hall:Pearson Education, Inc., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Homology (biology)|homology]] of such structures in various [[Viviparity|viviparous organisms]] is debatable, and in invertebrates such as [[Arthropod]]a, is [[Analogy (biology)|analogous]] at best.

==After birth==
===Infancy and childhood===
{{main|Infant|Child development|Child development stages}}
'''Childhood''' is the age span ranging from birth to [[adolescence]].&lt;ref name="Students Macmillan 1981 page 173"&gt;''Macmillan Dictionary for Students'' Macmillan, Pan Ltd. (1981), page 173. Retrieved 2010-7-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[developmental psychology]], childhood is divided up into the developmental stages of [[toddle]]rhood (learning to walk), [[early childhood]] (play age), middle childhood (school age), and adolescence (puberty through post-puberty). Various childhood factors could affect a person's attitude formation.'''&lt;ref name="Students Macmillan 1981 page 173"/&gt;

[[File:Child development stages.svg|thumb|center|800px|Approximate outline of development periods in [[child development]].]]

The [[Tanner stages]] can be used to approximately judge a child's age based on physical development.

===Puberty===
{{main|Puberty}}
'''Puberty''' is the process of physical changes through which a [[child]]'s [[Human body|body]] matures into an [[adult]] body capable of [[sexual reproduction]]. It is initiated by [[hormone|hormonal]] signals from the [[brain]] to the [[gonad]]s: the [[ovary|ovaries]] in a girl, the [[testis|testes]] in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate [[libido]] and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, [[bone]]s, [[muscle]], [[blood]], [[skin]], [[human hair growth|hair]], [[breast]]s, and [[sex organ]]s. [[Human development (biology)|Physical growth]]—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs.

On average, girls begin puberty around ages 10–11 and end puberty around 15–17; boys begin around ages 11–12 and end around 16–17.&lt;ref name="Kail"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kail |first=RV |author2=Cavanaugh JC |title=Human Development: A Lifespan View |isbn=0495600377 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |year=2010 |accessdate=September 11, 2014 |page=296 |edition=5th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-n5E7oyCgoC&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pamf.org"&gt;"For girls, puberty begins around 10 or 11 years of age and ends around age 16.

Notable among the [[morphology (biology)|morphologic]] changes in size, shape, composition, and functioning of the pubertal body, is the development of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, the "filling in" of the child's body; from girl to woman, from boy to man.

===Adulthood===
[[Biology|Biologically]], an '''adult''' is a [[human]] or other [[organism]] that has reached [[sexual maturity]]. In human context, the term ''adult'' additionally has meanings associated with [[social]] and [[Law|legal]] concepts. In contrast to a "[[Minor (law)|minor]]", a '''legal adult''' is a [[person]] who has attained the [[age of majority]] and is therefore regarded as independent, [[self-sufficient]], and [[:wikt:responsible|responsible]]. The typical age of attaining adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights and country.

Human adulthood encompasses [[Adult development|psychological adult development]]. Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]] and responsibility that may define an adult.

==Organ systems==
{{Organ system development}}
Development of human [[organ (biology)|organs]] and [[organ systems]] begins in the embryo and continues throughout the human lifespan.

'''Economics education''' or '''economic education''' is a field within [[economics]] that focuses on two main themes: 1) the current state of, and efforts to improve, the economics curriculum, materials and pedagogical techniques used to teach economics at all educational levels; and 2) research into the effectiveness of alternative instructional techniques in economics, the level of economic literacy of various groups, and factors that influence the level of economic literacy.&lt;ref&gt;W.E. Becker (2001). "Economic Education," ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences]]'', pp. 4078-4084.

==Organizations==
Numerous organizations devote resources toward economics education.  In the United States, organizations whose primary purpose is the advancement of economics education include the [[Council for Economic Education]] and its network of councils and centers, the [[Foundation for Teaching Economics]] and [[Junior Achievement]].  The U.S. [[National Center for Research in Economic Education]] is a resource for research and [[Educational assessment|assessment]] in economics education.  Among broader U.S. organizations that devote significant resources toward economics education is the [[Federal Reserve System]].  

In the United Kingdom there is The Economics Network, a government-funded national project to support economics education in [[Higher education]] contexts, and the non-profit Economics &amp; Business Education Association (EBEA) for [[secondary education]]. The non-profit organization [[Rethinking Economics]] is an international network of students and teachers promoting a change in the economics education towards more critical engagement, pluralism of theories and real-world applicability of the discipline. The movement has gained widespread support, among others by the [[Bank of England]].

Journals devoted to the topic of economics education include the ''[[Journal of Economic Education]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~econed/ Journal of Economic Education]&lt;/ref&gt; ''International Review of Economics Education'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economicsnetwork.ac.uk/iree International Review of Economics Education]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Australasian Journal of Economics Education'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/ajee/ Australasian Journal of Economics Education]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Computers in Higher Education Economics Review''.

The '''European Association for Digital Humanities''' ('''EADH'''), formerly known as the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC), is a [[digital humanities]] organisation founded in [[London]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="companion"&gt;History of Humanities Computing, in: A Companion to Digital Humanities (2004), ed. Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens, John Unsworth. Oxford: Blackwell|work= http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to promote the advancement of education in the digital humanities through the development and use of computational methods in research and teaching in the Humanities and related disciplines, especially literary and linguistic computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Constitution |work=EADH.org |url=http://www.allc.org/constitution | date=15 July 2013| accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Association joined the [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO).&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalhumanities.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A precursor for the later following annual conferences of the association was a meeting on literary and linguistic computing organized by Roy Wisbey and Michael Farringdon at the [[University of Cambridge]] in March, 1970. The year after the second conference in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]], in 1972, the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing was founded at a meeting at [[King's College, London]] (1973).&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; Together with the [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]] (ACH) and the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] (ACL), the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing sponsored and organized the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tei-c.org/About/history.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011 the Association's name was changed to the European Association for Digital Humanities, while keeping the allc.org domain name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= ALLC: Proposed Name Change |date= 20 December 2011 |url= http://www.allc.org/news-events/allc-proposed-name-change |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120211210537/http://www.allc.org/news-events/allc-proposed-name-change |archivedate= 11 February 2012 |accessdate= 20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change to 'EADH' was made in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conference ==
The first conferences of the association were held annually until 1988, when a protocol was agreed with the Association for Computing in the Humanities for co-sponsorship of joint international conferences. The venue for these joint conferences alternated between Europe and North America. The first one took place in 1989 at the [[University of Toronto]] in Canada. After the [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] had been formed in 2005, the first joint conference with the new name “Digital Humanities” was held at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Conferences, www.allc.org/conferences; for the 2006 conference, see http://www.allc-ach2006.colloques.paris-sorbonne.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journals ==
Initially, EADH published its own ''Bulletin'' three times a year; its journal twice yearly from 1980 to 1985.&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; Afterwards, bulletin and journal were merged in order to become ''[[Literary and Linguistic Computing]]'' (LLC) in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Terras, Melissa (2005). “Disciplined: Using Curriculum Studies to Define 'Humanities Computing’”, http://pear.hcmc.uvic.ca:8080/ach/site/xhtml.xq?id=43.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary and Linguistic Computing is a peer-reviewed, international journal that publishes texts "on all aspects of computing and information technology applied to literature and language research and teaching."&lt;ref&gt;http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
Membership of the association is by subscription to LLC.&lt;ref&gt;ALLC Membership,http://www.allc.org/about/membership&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010 there were 314 individual subscribers to Literary and Linguistic Computing.&lt;ref&gt;ALLC Membership Report December 2010, http://www.allc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/ALLC_Membership_report_December_2010.pdf.

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |God}}
The '''existence of God''' is a subject of debate in the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''The Rationality of Theism'' quoting [[Quentin Smith]] "God is not 'dead' in academia; it returned to life in the late 1960s". They cite "the shift from hostility towards theism in Paul Edwards's ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) to sympathy towards theism in the more recent ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide variety of arguments for and against the existence of [[God]] can be categorized as [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], [[logic]]al, [[Empirical research|empirical]], or [[Subjectivity|subjective]]. In [[Philosophy|philosophical]] terms, the question of the existence of God involves the disciplines of [[epistemology]] (the nature and scope of [[knowledge]]) and [[ontology]] (study of the nature of [[being]], [[existence]], or [[reality]]) and the [[Value theory|theory of value]] (since some definitions of God include "perfection").

The [[Western philosophy|Western tradition of philosophical discussion]] of the existence of God began with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], who made arguments that would now be categorized as [[cosmological argument|cosmological]]. Other arguments for the existence of God have been proposed by [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]], who formulated the first [[ontological argument]]; [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd (Averroes)]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]], who presented their own versions of the cosmological argument (the [[Kalam argument|''kalam'' argument]] and the [[Quinque viae|first way]], respectively); [[René Descartes]], who said that the existence of a benevolent God is [[logically necessary]] for the evidence of the senses to be meaningful. [[John Calvin]] argued for a ''[[sensus divinitatis]]'', which gives each human a knowledge of God's existence.

Philosophers who have provided arguments against the existence of God include [[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hume]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. In modern culture, the question of God's existence has been discussed by scientists such as [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Francis Collins]], [[Lawrence M. Krauss]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Carl Sagan]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNzlfYJaaCg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[John Lennox]] and [[Sam Harris]], as well as philosophers including [[Richard Swinburne]], [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[William Lane Craig]], [[Rebecca Goldstein]], [[A. C. Grayling]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Edward Feser]] and [[David Bentley Hart]].

Scientists follow the [[scientific method]], within which theories must be verifiable by [[physical experiment]]. The majority of prominent conceptions of God explicitly or effectively posit a being which is not testable either by proof or disproof. On these bases, the question regarding the existence of God, one for which evidence cannot be tested, may lie outside the purview of modern science [[Relationship between religion and science|by definition]]. The [[Catholic Church]] maintains that knowledge of the existence of God is the "natural light of human reason".&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Paragraph 47; cf. Canons of the First Vatican Council, 2:2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fideism|Fideists]] maintain that belief in the existence of God may not be amenable to demonstration or refutation, but rests on [[faith]] alone.

[[Atheists]] view arguments for the existence of God as insufficient, mistaken or weighing less in comparison to arguments against whereas some religions, such as [[Buddhism]], are not concerned with the existence of [[deity|gods]] at all and yet other religions, such as [[Jainism]], reject the possibility of a [[creator deity]].

==Positions==
[[File:EU belief in God.svg|thumb|Europeans polled who "believe in a god", according to [[Eurobarometer]] in 2005]]
[[File:Religious Belief in North America.png|thumb|North Americans polled about religious identity]]
Positions on the existence of God can be divided along numerous axes, producing a variety of orthogonal classifications. Theism and atheism are positions of belief (or lack of it), while [[gnosticism]] and agnosticism are positions of knowledge (or the lack of it). Ignosticism concerns belief regarding God's conceptual coherence. [[Apatheism]] concerns belief regarding the practical importance of whether God exists.

For the purposes of discussion, [[Richard Dawkins]] described seven "milestones" on his [[spectrum of theistic probability]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The God Delusion |isbn=978-0-618-68000-9 |publisher=Bantam Books |year=2006 |page=50|title-link=The God Delusion }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Strong theist. 100% [[probability]] of God. In the words of [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]]: "I do not believe, I know."
# ''[[De facto]]'' [[theist]]. Very high probability but short of 100%. "I don't know for certain, but I strongly believe in God and live my life on the assumption that he is there."
# Leaning towards theism. Higher than 50% but not very high. "I am very uncertain, but I am inclined to believe in God."
# Completely impartial. Exactly 50%. "God's existence and non-existence are exactly equiprobable."
# Leaning towards [[atheism]]. Lower than 50% but not very low. "I do not know whether God exists but I'm inclined to be skeptical."
# ''De facto'' atheist. Very low probability, but short of zero. "I don't know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there."
# Strong atheist. "I know there is no God, with the same conviction as Jung knows there is one."

===Theism===
{{Main|Theism}}
The Catholic Church, following the teachings of [[Paul the Apostle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the [[First Vatican Council]], affirms that God's existence "can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason".&lt;ref&gt;Vatican Council I, ''Dei Filius'' 2; quoted in ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', 2nd edition (New York: Doubleday, 1995) n. 36, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Traditional religious definition of God: personal, omnipotent, benevolent, transcendent====
In [[classical theism]], God is characterized as the metaphysically ultimate being (the first, timeless, absolutely simple and sovereign being, who is devoid of any [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] qualities), in distinction to other conceptions such as [[Theistic Personalism|theistic personalism]], [[open theism]], and [[process theism]]. Classical theists do not believe that God can be completely defined. They believe it would contradict the [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] nature of God for mere humans to define him. Robert Barron explains by analogy that it seems impossible for a two-dimensional object to conceive of three-dimensional humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barron|first=Robert|title=Catholicism: A Journey to the Heart of the Faith|year=2011|publisher=The Doubleday Religious Publishing Group|isbn=9780307720511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Western societies, the [[Conceptions of God|concepts of God]] typically entail a [[monotheism|monotheistic]], supreme, ultimate, and [[personal god|personal being]], as found in the [[Christian]], [[Islam]]ic and [[Judaism|Jewish]] traditions. In monotheistic religions outside the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic traditions]], the existence of God is discussed in similar terms. In these traditions, God is also identified as the author (either directly or by inspiration) of certain texts, or that certain texts describe specific historical events caused by the God in question or communications from God (whether in direct speech or via dreams or omens).  Some traditions also believe that God is the entity which is currently answering prayers for intervention or information or opinions.[[File:Ibn rushd.jpg|thumb|Ibn Rushd a 12th-century Islamic scholar]]

Many Islamic scholars have used philosophical and rational arguments to prove the existence of God. For example, [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd,]] a 12th-century Islamic scholar, philosopher, and physician, states there are only two arguments worthy of adherence, both of which are found in what he calls the "Precious Book" (The Qur'an). Rushd cites “providence” and “invention” in using the Qur'an's parables to claim the existence of God. Rushd argues that the Earth's weather patterns are conditioned to support human life; thus, if the planet is so finely-tuned to maintain life, then it suggests a fine tuner - God. The Sun and the Moon are not just random objects floating in the [[Milky Way]], rather they serve us day and night, and the way nature works and how life is formed, humankind benefits from it. Rushd essentially comes to a conclusion that there has to be a higher being who has made everything perfectly to serve the needs of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/ibnrushd/#H4|title=Ibn Rushd (Averroes)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/25/61|title=Quranic Parable|last=|first=|date=|website=Quran.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/78/6-16?translations=20|title=Quranic Parable|last=|first=|date=|website=Quran.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/80/24-33|title=Quranic Parable|last=|first=|date=|website=Quran.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses ben Maimon, widely known as [[Maimonides]], was a Jewish scholar who tried to logically prove the existence of God. Maimonides offered proofs for the existence of God, but he did not begin with defining God first, like many others do. Rather, he used the description of the earth and the universe to prove the existence of God. He talked about the Heavenly bodies and how they are committed to eternal motion. Maimonides argued that because every physical object is finite, it can only contain a finite amount of power. If everything in the universe, which includes all the planets and the stars, is finite, then there has to be an infinite power to push forth the motion of everything in the universe. Narrowing down to an infinite being, the only thing that can explain the motion is an infinite being (meaning God) which is neither a body nor a force in the body. Maimonides believed that this argument gives us a ground to believe that God is, not an idea of what God is. He believed that God cannot be understood or be compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/maimonides/#GodViaNeg|title=Maimonides|last=Seeskin|first=Kenneth|date=|website=plato.stanford|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-personal definitions of God====
In [[pantheism]], God and the universe are considered to be the same thing.  In this view, the natural sciences are essentially studying the nature of God. This definition of God creates the philosophical problem that a universe with God and one without God are the same, other than the words used to describe it.

[[Deism]] and [[panentheism]] assert that there is a God distinct from, or which extends beyond (either in time or in space or in some other way) the universe. These positions deny that God intervenes in the operation of the universe, including communicating with humans personally. The notion that God never intervenes or communicates with the universe, or may have evolved into the universe, makes it difficult, if not by definition impossible, to distinguish between a universe with God and one without.

====Debate about how theism should be argued====
In Christian faith, theologians and philosophers make a distinction between: (a) preambles of faith and (b) articles of faith. The preambles include alleged truths contained in revelation which are nevertheless demonstrable by reason, e.g., the immortality of the soul, the existence of God. The articles of faith, on the other hand, contain truths that cannot be proven or reached by reason alone and presuppose the truths of the preambles, e.g., the Holy Trinity, is not demonstrable and presupposes the existence of God.

The argument that the existence of God can be known to all, even prior to exposure to any divine revelation, predates Christianity. St. Paul made this argument when he said that pagans were without excuse because "since the creation of the world God's invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Romans|1:20|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Paul alludes to the proofs for a creator, later enunciated by St. Thomas&lt;ref&gt;For the proofs of God's existence by Saint Thomas Aquinas see Quinquae viae.&lt;/ref&gt; and others, but that had also been explored by the Greek philosophers.

Another apologetical school of thought, including Dutch and American [[Reformed Churches|Reformed]] thinkers (such as [[Abraham Kuyper]], [[Benjamin Warfield]], [[Herman Dooyeweerd]]), emerged in the late 1920s. This school was instituted by [[Cornelius Van Til]], and came to be popularly called [[presuppositional apologetics]] (though Van Til himself felt "transcendental" would be a more accurate title). The main distinction between this approach and the more classical evidentialist approach is that the presuppositionalist denies any common ground between the believer and the non-believer, except that which the non-believer denies, namely, the assumption of the truth of the theistic worldview. In other words, presuppositionalists do not believe that the existence of God can be proven by appeal to raw, uninterpreted, or "brute" facts, which have the same (theoretical) meaning to people with fundamentally different worldviews, because they deny that such a condition is even possible. They claim that the only possible proof for the existence of God is that the very same belief is the necessary condition to the intelligibility of all other human experience and action. They attempt to prove the existence of God by means of appeal to the [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] necessity of the belief—indirectly (by appeal to the unavowed presuppositions of the non-believer's worldview) rather than directly (by appeal to some form of common factuality). In practice this school utilizes what have come to be known as [[Transcendental argument for the existence of God|transcendental arguments]]. In these arguments they claim to demonstrate that all human experience and action (even the condition of unbelief, itself) is a proof for the existence of God, because God's existence is the necessary condition of their intelligibility.

Alvin Plantinga presents an argument for the existence of God using [[modal logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Alvin | last=Plantinga | authorlink=Alvin Plantinga | title=The Nature of Necessity | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1974 | page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have said that the logical and philosophical arguments for and against the existence of God miss the point. The word ''God'' has a meaning in human culture and history that does not correspond to the beings whose existence is supported by such arguments, assuming they are valid. The real question is not whether a "most perfect being" or an "uncaused first cause" exist. The real question is whether [[Jehovah]], [[Zeus]], [[Ra]], Krishna, or any gods of any religion exist, and if so, which gods? On the other hand, many theists equate all monotheistic or henotheistic "most perfect Beings", no matter what name is assigned to them/him, as the one monotheistic God (one example would be understanding the Muslim [[Allah]], Christian [[YHWH|Yhwh]], and Chinese [[Shangdi]] as different names for the same Being). Most of these arguments do not resolve the issue of which of these figures is more likely to exist. These arguments fail to make the distinction between immanent gods and a Transcendent God.

Some{{Who|date=June 2012}} Christians note that the Christian faith teaches "[[salvation]] is by faith",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb|2|Timothy|3:14–15|NIV}} &lt;cite&gt;NIV&lt;/cite&gt; "But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus." ''The Holy Bible, New International Version''. International Bible Society. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and that faith is reliance upon the faithfulness of God. The most extreme example of this position is called fideism, which holds that faith is simply the will to believe, and argues that if God's existence were rationally demonstrable, faith in its existence would become superfluous. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] argued that objective knowledge, such as 1+1=2, is unimportant to existence. If God could rationally be proven, his existence would be unimportant to humans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} It is because God cannot rationally be proven that his existence is important to us. In ''The Justification of Knowledge'', the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theologian [[Robert L. Reymond]] argues that believers should not attempt to prove the existence of God. Since he believes all such proofs are fundamentally unsound, believers should not place their confidence in them, much less resort to them in discussions with non-believers; rather, they should accept the content of revelation by faith. Reymond's position is similar to that of his mentor [[Gordon Clark]], which holds that all worldviews are based on certain unprovable first premises (or, axioms), and therefore are ultimately unprovable. The Christian theist therefore must simply choose to start with Christianity rather than anything else, by a "[[leap of faith]]". This position is also sometimes called presuppositional apologetics, but should not be confused with the Van Tillian variety.

===Atheism===
{{Main|Atheism}}
The atheistic conclusion is that the arguments and evidence both indicate there is insufficient reason to believe that any gods exist, and that personal subjective religious experiences say something about the human experience rather than the nature of reality itself; therefore, one has no reason to believe that a god exists.

====Positive atheism====
{{Main|Negative and positive atheism}}
[[Positive atheism]] (also called "strong atheism" and "hard atheism") is a form of atheism that asserts that no deities exist.&lt;ref name=Flew1976&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The strong atheist explicitly asserts the non-existence of gods. Some{{Who|date=June 2012}} strong atheists further assert that the existence of gods is logically impossible, stating that the combination of attributes which God may be asserted to have (omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, transcendence, omnibenevolence) are logically contradictory, incomprehensible, or absurd, and therefore the existence of such a god is ''a priori'' false. Metaphysical naturalism is a common worldview associated with strong atheism.

====Negative atheism====
Negative atheism (also called "weak atheism" and "soft atheism") is any type of atheism other than positive, wherein a person does not believe in the existence of any deities, but does not explicitly assert there to be none.&lt;ref name="Flew1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mmartin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="synonyms"/&gt;

===Agnosticism===
{{Main|Agnosticism}}
Agnosticism is the view that the [[truth value]] of certain claims—especially claims about the existence of any deity, but also other religious and metaphysical claims—is unknown or unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/agnosticism.html|title=agnosticism|last=Carroll|first=Robert|date=2009-02-22|website=The Skeptic's Dictionary|publisher=skepdic.com|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnosticism as a broad umbrella term does not define one's belief or disbelief in gods; agnostics may still identify themselves as theists or atheists.&lt;ref name="Agnostic Types"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/aboutagnosticism/p/overview.htm|title=What is Agnosticism?|last=Cline|first=Austin|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strong agnosticism====
[[Strong agnosticism]] is the belief that it is impossible for humans to know whether or not any deities exist.

====Weak agnosticism====
{{Main|Weak agnosticism}}
Weak agnosticism is the belief that the existence or nonexistence of deities is unknown but not necessarily unknowable.

====Agnostic theism====
{{Main|Agnostic theism}}
Agnostic theism is the [[philosophical]] view that encompasses both theism and agnosticism. An agnostic theist believes in the existence of a god or God, but regards the basis of this proposition as ''unknown or inherently unknowable''. Agnostic theists may also insist on ignorance regarding the properties of the gods they believe in.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/aboutagnosticism/a/theism.htm |title=Introduction to Agnosticism: What is Agnostic Theism? Believing in God, but not Knowing God |publisher=Atheism.about.com |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Agnostic atheism====
{{Main|Agnostic atheism}}
Agnostic atheism is a philosophical position that encompasses both atheism and agnosticism. Agnostic atheists are atheistic because they do not hold a [[belief]] in the existence of any deity and agnostic because they claim that the existence of a [[deity]] is either unknowable in principle or currently unknown in fact.

The theologian [[Robert Flint]] explains:
{{quote|If a man have failed to find any good reason for believing that there is a God, it is perfectly natural and rational that he should not believe that there is a God; and if so, he is an atheist, although he assume no superhuman knowledge, but merely the ordinary human power of judging of evidence. If he go farther, and, after an investigation into the nature and reach of human knowledge, ending in the conclusion that the existence of God is incapable of proof, cease to believe in it on the ground that he cannot know it to be true, he is an agnostic and also an atheist, an agnostic-atheist—an atheist because an agnostic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flint|first=Robert|title=Agnosticism|publisher=C.

===Apatheism===
{{Main|Apatheism}}
An apatheist is someone who is not interested in accepting or denying any claims that gods exist or do not exist. An apatheist lives as if there are no gods and explains natural [[phenomena]] without reference to any deities. The existence of gods is not rejected, but may be designated unnecessary or useless; gods neither provide purpose to [[personal life|life]], nor influence [[everyday life]], according to this view.&lt;ref name="Zdybicka-p20"&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ignosticism===
{{Main|Ignosticism}}
The ignostic (or igtheist) usually concludes that the question of God's existence or nonexistence is usually not worth discussing because concepts like "God" are usually not sufficiently clearly defined. Ignosticism or igtheism is the theological position that every other theological position (including [[agnosticism]] and atheism) assumes too much about the concept of God and many other theological concepts. It can be defined as encompassing two related views about the existence of God. The view that a coherent definition of God must be presented before the question of the existence of God can be meaningfully discussed. Furthermore, if that definition is [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]], the ignostic takes the [[theological noncognitivism|theological noncognitivist]] position that the question of the existence of God (per that definition) is meaningless.{{cn|reason= Citation needed for what seems very dubious Original Research (OR). The OR seems especially dubious as seemingly coming from a pseudo-Popperian perspective; Karl Popper objected to Logical Positivists' insistence that what was not verifiable was meaningless, and brought in Falsifiability partly to oppose them, but he also said that they were abusing the word 'meaningless' in a way that would wrongly render many important areas of human thought and experience 'meaningless'; there's no reason to suppose that ignostics are generally pseudo-Popperians, nor to unwittingly or wittingly imply it in this article. But all that's probably a lot less relevant here than the fact that the statement is seemingly OR.|date=August 2018}} In this case, the concept of God is not considered meaningless; the term "God" is considered meaningless. The second view is synonymous with theological noncognitivism, and skips the step of first asking "What is meant by 'God'?" before proclaiming the original question "Does God exist?" as meaningless.

Some philosophers have seen ignosticism as a variation of agnosticism or atheism,&lt;ref name="The Argument From Non-Cognitivism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_noncognitivism/ |title=The Argument From Non-Cognitivism |accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others{{Who|date=December 2016}} have considered it to be distinct.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} An ignostic maintains that he cannot even say whether he is a [[Theism|theist]] or an atheist until a sufficient definition of theism is put forth.

The term "ignosticism" was coined in the 1960s by [[Sherwin Wine]], a [[rabbi]] and a founding figure of [[Humanistic Judaism]]. The term "igtheism" was coined by the [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] [[Paul Kurtz]] in his 1992 book ''The New Skepticism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2010/07/definitions_1 |title=isms of the week: Agnosticism and Ignosticism |accessdate=December 19, 2011 | work=The Economist |date=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical issues==

===The problem of the supernatural===
One problem posed by the question of the existence of God is that traditional beliefs usually ascribe to God various [[supernatural]] powers. Supernatural beings may be able to conceal and reveal themselves for their own purposes, as for example in the tale of [[Baucis and Philemon]]. In addition, according to concepts of God, God is not part of the natural order, but the ultimate creator of nature and of the scientific laws. Thus in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]], God is viewed as part of the explanatory structure needed to support scientific conclusions and any powers God possesses are—strictly speaking—of the natural order that is derived from God's place as originator of nature (see also [[Monadology]]).

In [[Karl Popper]]'s [[philosophy of science]], belief in a supernatural God is outside the natural domain of scientific investigation because all scientific hypotheses must be falsifiable in the natural world. The [[non-overlapping magisteria]] view proposed by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] also holds that the existence (or otherwise) of God is irrelevant to and beyond the domain of science.

[[Logical positivism|Logical positivists]] such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[A. J. Ayer]] viewed any talk of gods as literal nonsense. For the logical positivists and adherents of similar schools of thought, statements about religious or other transcendent experiences can not have a [[truth value]], and are deemed to be without meaning, because such statements do not have any clear verification criteria. As the Christian biologist [[Scott C. Todd]] put it "Even if all the data pointed to an intelligent designer, such a hypothesis is excluded from science because it is not naturalistic."&lt;ref&gt;Scott C. Todd, "A View from Kansas on that Evolution Debate," Nature Vol. 401, Sep. 30, 1999, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; This argument limits the domain of science to the empirically observable and limits the domain of God to the unprovable.

===Nature of relevant proofs and arguments===
[[John Polkinghorne]] suggests that the nearest analogy to the existence of God in physics is the ideas of [[quantum mechanics]] which are seemingly paradoxical but make sense of a great deal of disparate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=John | last=Polkinghorne | authorlink=John Polkinghorne | title=Belief in God in an Age of Science | year=1998 | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=978-0-300-07294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alvin Plantinga compares the question of the existence of God to the question of the existence of [[Problem of other minds|other minds]], claiming both are notoriously impossible to "prove" against a determined skeptic.&lt;ref&gt;see his ''God and Other Minds: A Study of the Rational Justification of Belief in God'' Cornell (1990) {{ISBN|0-8014-9735-3}} and ''Warranted Christian Belief'' OUP (2000) {{ISBN|0-19-513193-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach, suggested by writers such as Stephen D. Unwin, is to treat (particular versions of) theism and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] as though they were two hypotheses in the [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] sense, to list certain data (or alleged data), about the world, and to suggest that the likelihoods of these data are significantly higher under one hypothesis than the other.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the [http://www.starcourse.org/discussion/ Beale/Howson debate] published [[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]] May, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the arguments for, or against, the existence of God can be seen as pointing to particular aspects of the universe in this way. In almost all cases it is not seriously suggested by proponents of the arguments that they are irrefutable, merely that they make one worldview seem significantly more likely than the other. However, since an assessment of the weight of evidence depends on the [[prior probability]] that is assigned to each worldview, arguments that a theist finds convincing may seem thin to an atheist and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''[[The Probability of God]]'' by ''Stephen D. Unwin'' its criticism in [[The God Delusion]], and the critical comment in that article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers, such as [[Wittgenstein]], take a view that is considered [[Anti-realism|anti-realist]] and oppose philosophical arguments related to God's existence. For instance, [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] contends that the real is whatever will not go away. If we cannot reduce talk about God to anything else, or replace it, or prove it false, then perhaps God is as real as anything else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/wittgens/ |title=iep.utm.edu |publisher=iep.utm.edu |date=2004-08-30 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George Berkeley]]'s ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' of 1710, he argued that a "naked thought" cannot exist, and that a perception is a thought; therefore only minds can be proven to exist, since all else is merely an idea conveyed by a perception. From this Berkeley argued that the universe is based upon observation and is non-objective. However, he noted that the universe includes "ideas" not perceptible to humankind, and that there must, therefore, exist an omniscient superobserver, which perceives such things. Berkeley considered this proof of the existence of the Christian god.

[[C.S. Lewis]], in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' and elsewhere, raised the [[argument from desire]]. He posed that all natural desires have a natural object. One thirsts, and there exists water to quench this thirst; One hungers, and there exists food to satisfy this hunger. He then argued that the human desire for perfect justice, perfect peace, perfect happiness, and other intangibles strongly implies the existence of such things, though they seem unobtainable on earth. He further posed that the unquenchable desires of this life strongly imply that we are intended for a different life, necessarily governed by a God who can provide the desired intangibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mere Christianity, Bk. III|chapter=10|first=C.S.|last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside of Western thought===
Existence in absolute truth is central to [[Vedanta]] epistemology. Traditional sense perception based approaches were put into question as possibly misleading due to preconceived or superimposed ideas. But though all object-cognition can be doubted, the existence of the doubter remains a fact even in ''[[nastika]]'' traditions of ''[[mayavada]]'' schools following [[Adi Shankara]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-7914-7081-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Klostermaier, Klaus K. |title=A survey of Hinduism |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |year=2007 |page=357|isbn=978-0-7914-7081-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five eternal principles to be discussed under ontology, beginning with God or Isvara, the [[Ultimate Reality]] cannot be established by the means of [[logic]] alone, and often require superior proof.&lt;ref&gt;Sudesh Narang (1984)''The Vaisnava Philosophy According to Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Vaisnavism]] [[Vishnu]], or his intimate ontological form of [[Krishna]], is equated to personal absolute God of the Western traditions. Aspects of Krishna as ''[[svayam bhagavan]]'' in original Absolute Truth, ''[[sat chit ananda]]'', are understood originating from three essential attributes of Krishna's form, i.e., "eternal existence" or ''{{IAST|sat}}'', related to the ''[[brahman]]'' aspect; "knowledge" or chit, to the ''[[paramatman]]''; and "bliss" or ''ananda'' in [[Sanskrit]], to ''[[bhagavan]]''.&lt;ref name="isbn0-231-12256-X"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maria Ekstrand |author2=Bryant, Edwin H. |title=The Hare Krishna movement: the postcharismatic fate of a religious transplant |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |year=2004 |page=7|isbn=978-0-231-12256-6|title-link=Hare Krishna movement }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for the existence of God==

===Empirical arguments===

====Argument from beauty====
One form of the [[argument from beauty]] is that the elegance of the laws of physics, which have been empirically discovered, or the [[Mathematical beauty|elegant laws of mathematics]], which are abstract but which have empirically proven to be useful, is evidence of a [[creator deity]] who has arranged these things to be beautiful and not ugly.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

====Argument from consciousness====
The [[argument from consciousness]] claims that human consciousness cannot be explained by the physical mechanisms of the human body and brain, therefore, asserting that there must be non-physical aspects to human consciousness.  This is held as indirect evidence of God, given that notions about [[soul]]s and the [[afterlife]] in Christianity and Islam would be consistent with such a claim.  Critics point out that non-physical aspects of consciousness could exist in a universe without any gods; for example, some religions that believe in [[reincarnation]] are compatible with atheism, monotheism, and polytheism.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The notion of the soul was created before modern understanding of [[neural network]]s and the physiology of the brain.  Decades of experimentation lead [[cognitive science]] to consider thought and emotion as physical processes although the experience of consciousness still remains poorly understood.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  The [[hard problem of consciousness]] remains as to whether different people subjectively experience the world in the same way — for example, that the color blue looks the same inside the minds of different people, though this is a philosophical problem with both physical and non-physical explanations.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

====Aquinas' Five Ways====
{{Main|Quinque viae}}
{{Hatnote|For in depth analysis of the individual arguments, see [[unmoved mover]], [[first cause]], [[argument from contingency]], [[argument from degree]], or [[teleological argument]].}}
In article 3, question 2, first part of his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', [[Thomas Aquinas]] developed his five arguments for God's existence. These arguments are grounded in an Aristotelian ontology and make use of the [[infinite regress|infinite regression argument]].&lt;ref name="Aquinas 1274"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Summa Theologica|year=1274|location=Part 1, Question 2, Article 3|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aquinas|first1=Thomas|last2=Kreeft|first2=Peter|title=Summa of the Summa|year=1990|publisher=Ignatius Press|pages=65–69|isbn=9780898703009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas did not intend to fully prove the existence of God as he is orthodoxly conceived (with all of his traditional attributes), but proposed his Five Ways as a first stage, which he built upon later in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Thought of Thomas Aquinas | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Davies, Brian | year=1992 | page=26 | isbn=9780191520440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas' Five Ways argued from the [[unmoved mover]], [[first cause]], [[necessary being]], [[argument from degree]], and the [[teleological argument]].

*The unmoved mover argument asserts that, from our experience of motion in the universe (motion being the transition from potentiality to actuality) we can see that there must have been an initial mover. Aquinas argued that whatever is in motion must be put in motion by another thing, so there must be an unmoved mover.&lt;ref name="Aquinas 1274"/&gt;
*Aquinas' argument from first cause started with the premise that it is impossible for a being to cause itself (because it would have to exist before it caused itself) and that it is impossible for there to be an infinite chain of causes, which would result in infinite regress. Therefore, there must be a first cause, itself uncaused.&lt;ref name="Aquinas 1274"/&gt;
*The argument from [[Argument from contingency|necessary being]] asserts that all beings are [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]], meaning that it is possible for them not to exist. Aquinas argued that if everything can possibly not exist, there must have been a time when nothing existed; as things exist now, there must exist a being with necessary existence, regarded as God.&lt;ref name="Aquinas 1274"/&gt;
*Aquinas argued from degree, considering the occurrence of degrees of goodness. He believed that things which are called good, must be called good in relation to a standard of good—a maximum. There must be a maximum goodness that which causes all goodness.&lt;ref name="Aquinas 1274"/&gt;
*The teleological argument asserts the view that things without intelligence are ordered towards a purpose. Aquinas argued that unintelligent objects cannot be ordered unless they are done so by an intelligent being, which means that there must be an intelligent being to move objects to their ends: God.&lt;ref name="Aquinas 1274"/&gt;

==== Dialectical argument ====
Philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Georg Hegel]] signed a publishing contract in 1831 for his final book, ''Lectures on the Proofs of the Existence of God'' (1831). Sadly, Hegel died that year, before completing his first draft of that work.  What we know about this planned work we find in the pages of his ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]]'' (1818-1831). There we find that Hegel proposed a dialectical reworking of the three classical proofs of the existence of God, namely: (1) the [[cosmological argument]]; (2) the [[teleological argument]]; and (3) the [[ontological argument]]. Hegel recognized that [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' had sharply criticized the three classical proofs, and as a veteran critic of Kantian epistemology, Hegel chose to show where Kant, [[Schleiermacher]] and [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]] had been mistaken in their negative positions over the three classical proofs.  Thus, Hegel went about reworking these classical arguments by using his own dialectical logic.

====Rational warrant====
Philosopher [[Stephen Toulmin]] is notable for his work in the history of ideas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Edelston Toulmin|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/600670/Stephen-Edelston-Toulmin|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that features the (rational) warrant: a statement that connects the premises to a conclusion.

Joseph Hinman applied Toulmin's approach in his argument for the existence of God, particularly in his book ''The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinman|first1=Joseph|title=The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief|publisher=GrandViaduct|isbn=978-0-9824087-1-1|edition=1|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of attempting to prove the existence of God, Hinman argues you can "demonstrate the rationally-warranted nature of belief".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinman|first1=Joseph|title=On Rational Warrant|url=http://metacrock.blogspot.com/2010/07/on-rational-warrant.html|website=Metacrock|accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinman uses a wide range of studies, including ones by Robert Wuthnow, Andrew Greeley, Mathes and Kathleen Nobel to establish that mystical experiences are life-transformative in a way that is significant, positive and lasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinman|first1=Joseph|title=The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief|publisher=GrandViaduct|isbn=978-0-9824087-1-1|edition=1|pages=85–92|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He draws on additional work to add several additional major points to his argument. First, the people who have these experiences not only do not exhibit traditional signs of mental illness but, often, are in better mental and physical health than the general population due to the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinman|first1=Joseph|title=The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief|publisher=GrandViaduct|isbn=978-0-9824087-1-1|edition=1|pages=90–92|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the experiences work. In other words, they provide a framework for navigating life that is useful and effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinman|first1=Joseph|title=The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief|publisher=GrandViaduct|isbn=978-0-9824087-1-1|edition=1|pages=100–103|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the evidence of the positive effects of the experience upon people's lives he, adapting a term from [[Derrida]], terms "the trace of God": the footprints left behind that point to the impact.

Finally, he discusses how both religious experience and belief in God is, and has always been, normative among humans:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinman|first1=Joseph|title=The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief|publisher=GrandViaduct|isbn=978-0-9824087-1-1|edition=1|pages=104–105|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; people do not need to prove the existence of God. If there is no need to prove, Hinman argues, and the Trace of God (for instance, the impact of mystical experiences on them), belief in God is rationally warranted.{{Clarify|date=January 2017}}

===Deductive arguments===
====Ontological argument====
{{Main|Ontological argument}}
The ontological argument has been formulated by philosophers including [[St. Anselm]] and [[René Descartes]]. The argument proposes that God's existence is self-evident. The logic, depending on the formulation, reads roughly as follows:&lt;ref name="Nolan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nolan|first=Lawrence|title=Descartes' Ontological Argument|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ontological/|publisher=Stanford}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
Whatever is contained in a clear and distinct idea of a thing must be predicated of that thing; but a clear and distinct idea of an absolutely perfect Being contains the idea of actual existence; therefore since we have the idea of an absolutely perfect Being such a Being must really exist.&lt;ref name="Nolan" /&gt;}}

Thomas Aquinas criticized the argument for proposing a definition of God which, if God is transcendent, should be impossible for humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Summa Theologica|year=1274|location=Part 1, Question 2|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immanuel Kant criticized the proof from a logical standpoint: he stated that the term "God" really signifies two different terms: both idea of God, and God. Kant concluded that the proof is equivocation, based on the ambiguity of the word God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kreeft|first=Peter|title=Socrates Meets Kant|year=2009|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=9781586173487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant also challenged the argument's assumption that existence is a predicate (of perfection) because it does not add anything to the essence of a being. If existence is not a predicate, then it is not [[logical truth|necessarily true]] that the greatest possible being exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/ont-arg | title=Ontological Argument | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=27 April 2005 | accessdate=October 12, 2011 | author=Himma, Kenneth Einar}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common rebuttal to Kant's critique is that, although "existence" does add something to both the concept and the reality of God, the concept would be vastly different if its referent is an unreal Being.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Another response to Kant is attributed to Alvin Plantinga who explains that even if one were to grant Kant that "existence" is not a real predicate, "Necessary Existence", which is the correct formulation of an understanding of God, is a real predicate, thus according to Plantinga Kant's argument is refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mind.ucsd.edu/syllabi/02-03/01w/readings/plantinga.html |title=Plantinga 'The Ontological Argument' Text |publisher=Mind.ucsd.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314123846/http://mind.ucsd.edu/syllabi/02-03/01w/readings/plantinga.html |archivedate=2013-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inductive arguments===
Inductive arguments argue their conclusions through [[inductive reasoning]].
* Another class of philosophers asserts that the proofs for the existence of God present a fairly large probability though not absolute certainty. A number of obscure points, they say, always remain; an act of faith is required to dismiss these difficulties. This view is maintained, among others, by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] statesman [[Arthur Balfour]] in his book ''The Foundations of Belief'' (1895). The opinions set forth in this work were adopted in [[France]] by [[Ferdinand Brunetière]], the editor of the ''[[Revue des deux Mondes]]''. Many orthodox Protestants express themselves in the same manner, as, for instance, Dr. E. Dennert, President of the Kepler Society, in his work ''Ist Gott tot?''&lt;ref&gt;(Stuttgart, 1908)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other arguments====
* The hypothesis of well design proposes that certain features of the universe and of [[Life|living things]] are the product of an [[Intelligence|intelligent]] [[Causality|cause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelligentdesign.org/whatisid.php |title=Intelligent Design |publisher=Intelligent Design |date= |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its proponents are mainly Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

===Subjective arguments===
====Arguments from historical events or personages====
* The sincere seeker's argument, espoused by Muslim Sufis of the Tasawwuf tradition, posits that every individual who follows a formulaic path towards guidance, arrives at the same destination of conviction in the existence of God and specifically in the monotheistic tenets and laws of Islam. This could only be true if the formula and supplication were being answered by the same Divine entity being addressed, as claimed in Islamic revelations.  This was formally organized by Imam Abu Hamid [[Al-Ghazali]] in such notable works as "Deliverance from Error" and "The Alchemy of Happiness," in Arabic "[[Kimiya-yi sa'adat]]".  The path includes following the golden rule of no harm to others and treating others with compassion, silence or minimal speech, seclusion, daily fasting or minimalist diet of water and basic nourishment, honest wages, and daily supplication towards "the Creator of the Universe" for guidance.&lt;ref name="Ghazali 1100"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Abu Hamid|title=Deliverance from Error|year=1100|url=http://ghazali.org/books/md/gz101.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghazali 1105"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Abu Hamid|title=The Alchemy of Happiness|year=1105|url=http://www.ghazali.org/books/alchemy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] assert that God intervened in key specific moments in history, especially at [[the Exodus]] and the giving of the [[Ten Commandments]] in front of all the tribes of Israel, positing an argument from empirical evidence stemming from sheer number of witnesses, thus demonstrating his existence.{{citation needed|date=June 2016|reason=Citation|https://books.google.com/books?id=CfVDG8aAcLIC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=Christianity+and+Judaism+assert+that+God+intervened+in+key+specific+moments+in+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-SDrY9TP90&amp;sig=1RRyylUjmHO1zkSDxkQQlBjNHoY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzsOSnmb3PAhXSix4KHaN2DIsQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false=}}
* [[Christological argument]]s assert that certain events of the Christian [[New Testament]] are historically accurate, and prove God's existence, namely:
** The [[Resurrection of Jesus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=John | last=Polkinghorne | authorlink=John Polkinghorne | title=Science and Christian Belief | pages=108–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; (an [[argument from miracles]])
** The claims of Jesus, as a morally upstanding person, to be the son of God (an [[argument from authority]])
** The belief of Jesus, as a wise person, that God exists (an [[argument from authority]])
* Islam asserts that the revelation of its holy book, the [[Qur'an]], and its unique literary attributes, vindicate its divine authorship, and thus the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Islamic Awareness: The Challenge of the Qur'an | url=http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Miracle/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=The Inimitability of the Qur'an | url=http://www.hamzatzortzis.com/essays-articles/exploring-the-quran/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], also known as [[Mormonism]], similarly asserts that the miraculous appearance of God, Jesus Christ, and angels to [[Joseph Smith]] and others and subsequent finding and translation of the [[Book of Mormon]] establishes the existence of God. The whole [[Latter Day Saint movement]] makes the same claim for example [[Community of Christ]], [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], [[Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]], [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]], [[Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)]], etc.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
** The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), similarly asserts that the finding and translation of the [[Plates of Laban]], also known as the [[Brass Plates]], into the [[Book of the Law of the Lord]] and [[Voree plates]] by [[James Strang]], [[One Mighty and Strong]], establishes the existence of God.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
** Various sects that have broken from the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) (such as [[Church of Christ "With the Elijah Message"]] and [[Church of Christ (Assured Way)]]) claim that the message brought by [[John the Baptist]], One Mighty and Strong, to [[Otto Fetting]] and [[W. A. Draves]] in [[The Word of the Lord|The Word of the Lord Brought to Mankind by an Angel]] establishes the existence of God.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

====Arguments from testimony====
Arguments from testimony rely on the testimony or experience of witnesses, possibly embodying the propositions of a specific revealed [[religion]]. Swinburne argues that it is a principle of rationality that one should accept testimony unless there are strong reasons for not doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Richard | last=Swinburne | authorlink=Richard Swinburne | title=Is there a God? | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-19-823545-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[witness argument]] gives credibility to personal [[witness]]es, contemporary and throughout the ages. A variation of this is the [[argument from miracles]] (also referred to as "the priest stories") which relies on testimony of supernatural events to establish the existence of God.
* The [[argument from common consent|majority argument]] argues that the theism of people throughout most of recorded history and in many different places provides ''[[prima facie]]'' demonstration of God's existence.

=====Arguments grounded in personal experiences=====
{{See also|Anecdotal evidence}}
* The sincere seeker's argument, espoused by Muslim Sufis of the Tasawwuf tradition, posits that every individual who follows a formulaic path towards guidance, arrives at the same destination of conviction in the existence of God and specifically in the monotheistic tenets and laws of Islam. This apparent natural law for guidance and belief could only be consistent if the formula and supplication were being answered by the same Divine entity being addressed, as claimed in Islamic revelations.  This was formally organized by Imam Abu Hamid [[Al-Ghazali]] in such notable works as "Deliverance from Error" and "The Alchemy of Happiness," in Arabic "[[Kimiya-yi sa'ādat]]".  The path includes following the golden rule of no harm to others and treating others with compassion, silence or minimal speech, seclusion, daily fasting or minimalist diet of water and basic nourishment, honest wages, and daily supplication towards "the Creator of the Universe" for guidance.&lt;ref name="Ghazali 1100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghazali 1105"/&gt;
* The [[Argument from a proper basis]] argues that belief in God is "properly basic"; that it is similar to statements like "I see a chair" or "I feel pain".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Such beliefs are non-falsifiable and, thus, neither provable nor disprovable; they concern perceptual beliefs or indisputable mental states.
* In [[Germany]], the School of [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] taught that human reason is able to perceive the suprasensible. Jacobi distinguished three faculties: sense, [[reason]], and understanding. Just as sense has immediate perception of the material so has reason immediate perception of the immaterial, while the understanding brings these perceptions to a person's consciousness and unites them to one another.&lt;ref&gt;([[A. Stöckl]], ''Geschichte der neueren Philosophie'', II, 82 sqq.)&lt;/ref&gt; God's existence, then, cannot be proven (Jacobi, like Immanuel Kant, rejected the absolute value of the principle of causality), it must be felt by the mind.
* The same theory was advocated in Germany by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], who assumed an inner religious sense by means of which people feel religious truths. According to Schleiermacher, religion consists solely in this inner perception, and dogmatic doctrines are inessential.&lt;ref&gt;(Stöckl, loc. cit., 199 sqq.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brahma Kumaris]] religion was established in 1936, when God was said to enter the body of diamond merchant [[Lekhraj Kripalani]] (1876–1969) in Hyderabad, Sindh and started to speak through him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brahmakumaris.org/about-us/history/60.html "Based on our real life experiences we clearly know that it was God, the Supreme Soul, Shiva, Himself, had entered into his body. It was God who had revealed the truth about the coming destruction, and of the establishment of the heavenly world which would then follow. And it was God Himself who had given the sign that he, Dada, was to be His medium and the engine for creating such a divine world."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725102100/http://brahmakumaris.org/about-us/history/60.html |date=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Babb, Lawrence A.

===Hindu arguments===
The school of Vedanta argues that one of the proofs of the existence of God is the law of [[karma]]. In a commentary to [[Brahma Sutras]] (III, 2, 38, and 41), [[Adi Sankara]] argues that the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results at some future time; neither can super sensuous, non-intelligent qualities like [[adrsta]] by themselves mediate the appropriate, justly deserved pleasure and pain. The fruits, according to him must be administered through the action of a conscious agent, namely, a supreme being ([[Ishvara]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Reichenbach | first =Bruce R. | title =Karma, causation, and divine intervention | journal =Philosophy East and West | volume =39 | issue =2 | pages = 135–149 [145] | date = April 1989 | url =http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/reiche2.htm | accessdate = 2009-12-29 | doi=10.2307/1399374| jstor =1399374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nyaya]] school make similar arguments.

== Arguments against the existence of God ==
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Atheism]]--&gt;
{{Atheism sidebar |arguments}}{{Irreligion sidebar |atheism}}Each of the arguments below aims to show that a particular set of gods does not exist—by demonstrating them to be inherently meaningless, [[proof by contradiction|contradictory]], or at odds with known [[science|scientific]] or [[history|historical]] facts—or that there is insufficient proof to say that they do exist.

===Empirical arguments===
The following empirical arguments rely on observations or experimentation to yield their conclusions.
* The [[argument from inconsistent revelations]] contests the existence of the deity called God as described in [[scriptures]]—such as the Hindu [[Vedas]], the Jewish [[Tanakh]], the Christian [[Bible]], the Muslim [[Qur'an]], the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon]] or the Baha'i [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas|Aqdas]]—by identifying apparent contradictions between different scriptures, within a single scripture, or between scripture and known facts.
* The [[problem of evil]] contests the existence of a god who is both omnipotent and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] by arguing that such a god should not permit the existence of [[evil]] or [[suffering]]. The theist responses are called [[theodicy|theodicies]].
* The [[destiny of the unevangelized]], by which persons who have never even heard of a particular revelation might be harshly punished for not following its dictates.
* The [[argument from poor design]] contests the idea that God created life on the basis that lifeforms, including humans, seem to exhibit poor design.
* The [[argument from nonbelief]] contests the existence of an omnipotent God who wants humans to believe in him by arguing that such a god would do a better job of gathering believers.
* The argument from parsimony (using [[Occam's razor]]) contends that since natural (non-supernatural) theories adequately explain the [[development of religion]] and belief in gods,&lt;ref&gt;''Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought'', Pascal Boyer, Basic Books (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; the actual existence of such supernatural agents is superfluous and may be dismissed unless otherwise proven to be required to explain the phenomenon.
* The analogy of [[Russell's teapot]] argues that the [[Philosophic burden of proof|burden of proof]] for the existence of God lies with the theist rather than the atheist; it can be considered an extension of Occam's Razor.

===Deductive arguments===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Atheism]] --&gt;
The following arguments deduce, mostly through self-contradiction, the existence of a God as "the Creator". 
*Stephen Hawking and co-author Leonard Mlodinow state in their book ''[[The Grand Design (book)|The Grand Design]]'' that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. Both authors claim that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings.&lt;ref&gt;p. 172, ''[[The Grand Design (book)|The Grand Design]]'', Stephen Hawking, Leonard Mlodinow&lt;/ref&gt; Christian mathematicians and scientists, most notably [[Leonhard Euler#Commemorations|Leonhard Euler]], [[Bernard d'Espagnat]]&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"&gt;Gefter, Amanda [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16769-concept-of-hypercosmic-god-wins-templeton-prize/ "Concept of 'hypercosmic God' wins Templeton Prize,"] ''The New Scientist'', Mar. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Lennox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Professor John Lennox |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1308599/Stephen-Hawking-wrong-You-explain-universe-God.html |title=Stephen Hawking is wrong. You can't explain the universe without God &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2010-09-03 |accessdate=2013-05-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; disagree with that kind of skeptical argument.
* A counter-argument against God as the Creator takes the assumption of the Cosmological argument ("the chicken or the egg"), that things cannot exist without creators, and applies it to God, setting up an infinite regress.
* Dawkins' [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]] analogizes the above. Some theists argue that [[evolution]] is akin to a hurricane assembling a Boeing 747 —  that the universe (or life) is too complex ''not'' to have been designed by someone, who theists call God. Dawkin's counter-argument is that such a God would himself be complex — the "Ultimate" Boeing 747 — and therefore require a designer.
* [[Theological noncognitivism]] is the argument that religious language – specifically, words such as "God" – are not cognitively meaningful and that irreducible definitions of God are circular.
Some arguments focus on the existence of specific conceptions of God as being omniscient, omnipotent, and morally perfect.
* The [[omnipotence paradox]] suggests that the concept of an [[omnipotent]] entity is logically contradictory by considering questions such as "Can God create a rock so big that He cannot move it?" or "If God is all powerful, could God create a being more powerful than Himself?"
* Similarly, the omniscience paradox argues that God cannot be omniscient because he would not know how to create something unknown to himself.
* Another argument points to the contradiction of omniscience and omnipotence arguing that God is bound to follow whatever God foreknows himself doing.
* [[Argument from free will]] contends that omniscience and the free will of humanity are incompatible and that any conception of God that incorporates both properties is therefore inherently contradictory: if God is omniscient, then God already knows humanity's future, contradicting the claim of free will.
* The anthropic argument states that if God is omniscient, omnipotent, and morally perfect, he would have created other morally perfect beings instead of imperfect ones, such as humans.
* The [[problem of hell]] is the idea that eternal damnation contradicts God's omnibenevolence and [[omnipresence]].

===Inductive arguments===
Inductive arguments argue their conclusions through inductive reasoning.
* The [[Atheistic existentialism|atheist-existential]] argument for the [[non-existence]] of a perfect sentient being states that if [[existence precedes essence]], it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the meaning of the term ''sentient'' that a sentient being cannot be complete or perfect. It is touched upon by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]''. Sartre's phrasing is that God would be a ''pour-soi'' [a being-for-itself; a consciousness] who is also an ''en-soi'' [a being-in-itself; a thing]: which is a contradiction in terms. The argument is echoed thus in [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[Grimus]]'': "That which is complete is also dead."
* The "no reason" argument tries to show that an omnipotent and omniscient being would not have any reason to act in any way, specifically by creating the universe, because it would have no needs, wants, or desires since these very concepts are subjectively human. Since the universe exists, there is a contradiction, and therefore, an omnipotent god cannot exist. This argument is expounded upon by [[Scott Adams]] in the book ''[[God's Debris]]'', which puts forward a form of [[Pandeism]] as its fundamental theological model. A similar argument is put forward in [[Ludwig von Mises]]'s "Human Action". He referred to it as the "praxeological argument" and claimed that a perfect being would have long ago satisfied all its wants and desires and would no longer be able to take action in the present without proving that it had been unable to achieve its wants faster—showing it imperfect.
* The "historical induction" argument concludes that since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. [[ancient Egyptian religion]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religion]]) and their gods ultimately come to be regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction. [[H. L. Mencken]] wrote a short piece about the topic entitled "Memorial Service" in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[["H.L. Mencken: Where is the Graveyard of Dead Gods?" http://jonathongreen.co.uk/h-l-mencken-where-is-the-graveyard-of-dead-gods/]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is implied as part of Stephen F. Roberts' popular quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Subjective arguments===
{{see also|Anecdotal evidence}}
Similar to the [[Wiktionary:subjective#Pronunciation|subjective]] arguments for the existence of God, subjective arguments against the supernatural mainly rely on the testimony or experience of witnesses, or the propositions of a revealed religion in general.

* The witness argument gives credibility to personal witnesses, contemporary and from the past, who disbelieve or strongly doubt the existence of God.
* The conflicted religions argument notes that many religions give differing accounts as to what God is and what God wants; since all the contradictory accounts cannot be correct, many if not all religions must be incorrect.
* The disappointment argument claims that if, when asked for, there is no visible help from God, there is no reason to believe that there is a God.

===Hindu arguments===
[[Atheism in Hinduism|Atheistic Hindu doctrines]] cite various arguments for rejecting a creator God or ''Ishvara''. The ''[[Samkhyapravachana Sutra|{{IAST |Sāṁkhyapravacana Sūtra}}]]'' of the [[Samkhya]] school states that there is no philosophical place for a creator God in this system. It is also argued in this text that the existence of Ishvara (God) cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thesamkhyaphilos00sinhuoft/thesamkhyaphilos00sinhuoft_djvu.txt Sāṁkhyapravacana Sūtra] I.92.&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Samkhya argues against the existence of God on metaphysical grounds. For instance, it argues that an unchanging God cannot be the source of an ever-changing world. It says God is a necessary metaphysical assumption demanded by circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rajadhyaksha|title=The six systems of Indian philosophy|year=1959|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ihkRAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sutras of Samkhya endeavor to prove that the idea of God is inconceivable and self-contradictory, and some{{Which|date=June 2012}} commentaries speak plainly on this subject. The ''Sankhya- tattva-kaumudi'', commenting on Karika 57, argues that a perfect God can have no need to create a world, and if God's motive is kindness, Samkhya questions whether it is reasonable to call into existence beings who while non-existent had no suffering. Samkhya postulates that a benevolent deity ought to create only happy creatures, not an imperfect world like the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism and Buddhism, Vol II. (of 3)|first=Charles|last=Eliot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K4ZpPleiyokC|page=243|isbn=9781406862966|date=2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charvaka]], originally known as Lokāyata, a heterodox Hindu philosophy states that there is "no God, no [[samsara]] (rebirth), no karma, no duty, no fruits of merit, no sin."&lt;ref&gt;Haribhadrasūri (Translator: M Jain, 1989), Saddarsanasamuccaya, Asiatic Society, {{oclc|255495691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the school of [[Mimamsa]], which is based on [[ritual]]s and [[orthopraxy]], decided that the evidence allegedly proving the existence of God is insufficient. They argue that there is no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there is no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a god to validate the rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious truth|first=Robert|last=Neville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThLR13JpCWsC|page=51|isbn=9780791447789|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mimamsa argues that the gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the ''[[mantra]]s'' that speak their names. In that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The perfectibility of human nature in eastern and western thought |first=Harold |last=Coward |authorlink=Harold Coward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkE_8uch5P0C|page=114|isbn=9780791473368 |date=2008-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological aspects==
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Several authors have offered psychological or sociological explanations for belief in the existence of God.

Psychologists observe that the majority of humans often ask existential questions such as "why we are here" and whether life has purpose. Some psychologists{{Weasel inline|date=June 2012}} have posited that religious beliefs may recruit cognitive mechanisms in order to satisfy these questions. [[William James]] emphasized the inner religious struggle between [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] and happiness, and pointed to [[trance]] as a cognitive mechanism. [[Sigmund Freud]] stressed fear and pain, the need for a powerful parental figure, the obsessional nature of ritual, and the hypnotic state a community can induce as contributing factors to the psychology of religion.

[[Pascal Boyer]]'s ''Religion Explained'' (2002), based in part on his anthropological field work, treats belief in God as the result of the brain's tendency towards [[agency detection]]. Boyer suggests that, because of evolutionary pressures, humans err on the side of attributing agency where there isn't any. In Boyer's view, belief in supernatural entities spreads and becomes culturally fixed because of their memorability. The concept of "minimally counterintuitive" beings that differ from the ordinary in a small number of ways (such as being invisible, able to fly, or having access to strategic and otherwise secret information) leave a lasting impression that spreads through word-of-mouth.

[[Scott Atran]]'s ''In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion'' (2002) makes a similar argument and adds examination of the socially coordinating aspects of shared belief. In ''Minds and Gods: The Cognitive Foundations of Religion'', [[Todd Tremlin]] follows Boyer in arguing that universal human cognitive process naturally produces the concept of the supernatural. Tremlin contends that an agency detection device (ADD) and a [[theory of mind]] module (ToMM) lead humans to suspect an agent behind every event. Natural events for which there is no obvious agent may be attributed to God (c.f. [[Act of God]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13720">The '''Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation''' is the country's largest statewide, nonprofit preservation organization with more than 8,000 members. Founded in 1973, the Trust is committed to preserving and enhancing Georgia’s communities and their diverse historic resources for the education and enjoyment of all.

The Georgia Trust generates community revitalization by finding buyers for endangered properties acquired by its ''Revolving Fund''; encourages neighborhood revitalization and provides design assistance to 105 Georgia ''Main Street'' cities; trains Georgia’s teachers to engage students in 61 Georgia school systems to discover state and national history through their local historic resources; and advocates for funding, tax incentives and other laws aiding preservation efforts.  The Georgia Trust is a recipient of the Trustees Award for Organizational Excellence from the National Trust for Historic Preservation.  [http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatsnew/boilerplate.htm]

[[Image:Rhodes Hall Exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Rhodes Hall]] serves as the headquarters for the Georgia Trust.]]
The Georgia Trust operates two historic house museums:
* [[Johnston-Felton-Hay House|Hay House]], 1859, Macon
* [[Rhodes Hall]], 1904, Atlanta

== Georgia Trust Programs ==
In addition to providing preservation resources for individuals and communities throughout the state, The Georgia Trust helps save endangered houses and buildings, uncover the beauty of downtown buildings, educate the next preservation generation, and advocate for preservation funding and laws through the following programs:

=== Revolving Fund for Endangered Properties ===
The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation established the Revolving Fund for endangered properties in 1990 to provide effective alternatives to demolition or neglect of architecturally and historically significant properties by promoting rehabilitation and enabling owners of endangered historic properties to connect with buyers who will rehabilitate their properties.

The Revolving Fund accomplishes this goal by either accepting property donations or by purchasing options on endangered historic properties. The properties are then marketed nationally to locate buyers who agree to preserve and maintain the structures. Protective covenants are attached to the deeds to ensure that the historic integrity of each property is retained, and purchasers are required to sign rehabilitation agreements based on the work to be performed on the structure.[http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/revolving_fund.htm]

=== Main Street Design Assistance Program ===
Since the Main Street program's start in 1980, The Georgia Trust has offered design assistance, on-site rehabilitation consultations, hands-on presentations and hand-drawn and digital renderings to help business owners and downtown managers rehabilitate and reuse their historic resources.

Services provided by The Georgia Trust's Main Street Design Assistance Program have become integral to downtown revitalization efforts. Supported by the Department of Community Affairs' (DCA) Office of Downtown Development, the program has assisted more than 3,000 business owners in 105 Main Street cities across Georgia to encourage the rehabilitation of historic downtown commercial buildings. [http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/main_streetda.htm]

=== Talking Walls ===
A recipient of a Governor's Award in the Humanities, the Talking Walls heritage education program has trained more than 1,700 teachers, who have reached more than 370,000 students in 61 school systems in Georgia since 1991. The program's teacher workshops and ongoing local support trains educators to use local historic resources such as photos, maps, oral histories and historic buildings as teaching tools in Georgia's mandated curriculum.

The Georgia Department of Education recently emphasized the Trust's key role as an important educational resource by approving the Trust as a partner in its Educational Initiatives Program. This status recognizes The Georgia Trust as an official collaborator with the DOE to provide quality instructional materials to educators across the state. Talking Walls also received statewide certification by the Georgia DOE, allowing the Trust to award professional recertification credits to teachers attending program workshops. [http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/talking_walls.htm]

=== Georgians for Preservation Action ===
Founded in 1987, the statewide coordinating council for historic preservation advocacy encourages laws, programs and policies that promote the preservation of Georgia’s historic resources by mobilizing grassroots preservationists across the state.[http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/georgians_preservation_action.htm]

Among its activities, GaPA:

* Annually develops and advocates a legislative agenda that represents a consensus of the leaders of key preservation constituencies on preservation issues. 
* Regularly communicates with historic preservation advocates about critical issues and legislation before the General Assembly. 
* Hosts a Legislative Reception for preservation supporters to meet with legislators. 
* Provides GaPA members with information on national preservation issues with news from the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] and Preservation Action, the national lobbying arm for historic preservation.

== ''Places in Peril'' ==
The Georgia Trust releases an annual list of endangered historic sites throughout Georgia. The ''Places in Peril'' program seeks to identify significant historic, archaeological and cultural properties that are threatened by demolition, deterioration or insensitive public policy or development, and have a demonstrable level of community interest, commitment and support. Through this program, the Trust encourages owners and individuals, organizations and communities to employ preservation tools, partnerships and resources necessary to preserve and utilize selected historic properties in peril.

Historic properties are selected for listing based on several criteria. Sites must be listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or the Georgia Register of Historic Places and must be subject to a serious threat to their existence or historical, architectural and/or archeological integrity. There must also be a demonstrable level of community commitment and support for the preservation of listed sites.[http://www.georgiatrust.org/preservation_resources/places_in_peril.htm]

== Publications ==

=== ''The Rambler'' ===

The ''Rambler'' is The Georgia Trust's quarterly publication. It is distributed to members of The Georgia Trust from around the state and to other state and national preservation organizations.

=== ''J. Neel Reid, Architect'' ===

Architect J. Neel Reid (and his partners in Hentz, Reid &amp; Adler) founded the Georgia school of classicists after study at Columbia University and abroad. Many sources influenced Reid’s architecture, and his interior and garden designs. His travel diary, sketchbooks and scrapbooks, and extensive library reflect this. His early-twentieth-century interest in historic preservation and contextual design, in architectural education and professional standards of practice inspired others long after his tragic early death of a brain tumor in 1926.

Reid’s father’s family were Troup County, Georgia, pioneers; he grew up in Macon, beginning apprenticeship and practice there before, in 1909, moving to Atlanta.

''J. Neel Reid, Architect'' by William R. Mitchell, Jr. and published by The Georgia Trust, gives new life to Reid’s rich legacy, keeping his influence fresh in this new century. The J. Neel Reid Prize, provided by a Georgia Trust fund produced from the sale of the book, helps ensure continuation of Reid’s influence among a new generation of architects.

Proceeds from book sales help support the J. Neel Reid Prize, a yearly award to an architecture student, an architect intern or a recently registered architect for study travel that honors the legacy of Neel Reid.

=== ''Democracy Restored: A History of the Georgia State Capitol'' ===

Written by Timothy J. Crimmins and Anne H. Farrisee with photographs by Diane Kirkland, the award-winning ''Democracy Restored'' is a stunning and fully illustrated history of the Georgia Capital that not only pays tribute to a grand ole edifice, but also vividly recounts the history that was made—and that continues to be made—within and without its walls. The Georgia Capitol is a place where, for more than a century, legislators have debated, governors have proclaimed, and courts have ruled. It is also a place where countless ordinary citizens have gathered in lively tour groups, angry protest mobs, and at times, solemn funeral processions.

Proceeds go to The Georgia Trust and the Capitol Restoration Fund.

The '''global temperature record''' shows the fluctuations of the [[temperature]] of the atmosphere and the oceans through various spans of time.  The most detailed information exists since 1850, when methodical thermometer-based records began.  There are numerous estimates of temperatures since the end of the [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciation]], particularly during the current [[Holocene]] epoch.  Older time periods are studied by [[paleoclimatology]].

== Satellite and balloon (1950s-present) ==

[[File:Satellite Temperatures.png|240px|thumb]]

{{main|Satellite temperature measurements}}
[[Weather balloon]] [[radiosonde]] measurements of atmospheric temperature at various altitudes begin to show an approximation of global coverage in the 1950s. Since December 1978, [[microwave sounding unit]]s on satellites have produced data which can be used to [[MSU temperature measurements|infer temperatures]] in the [[troposphere]].

Several groups have analyzed the satellite data to calculate temperature trends in the troposphere. Both the [[UAH satellite temperature dataset|University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH) and the private, NASA funded, corporation [[Remote Sensing Systems]] [[Remote Sensing Systems|RSS]] (RSS) find an upward trend.

For the lower troposphere (TLT), UAH find a global average trend since 1978 of +0.140&amp;nbsp;°C/decade, to January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/t2lt/tltglhmam_5.4|title=MONTHLY MEANS OF LOWER TROPOSPHERE LT5.4|work=UAH|accessdate=26 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717025455/http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/t2lt/tltglhmam_5.4|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Temperature record of the past 1000 years}}

[[Proxy (climate)|Proxy]] measurements can be used to reconstruct the temperature record before the historical period. Quantities such as [[tree ring]] widths, [[Coral#Climate research|coral growth]], [[Ice core#Isotopic analysis|isotope variations]] in [[ice core]]s, ocean and lake sediments, [[Speleothem#As climate proxies|cave deposits]], [[fossil]]s, [[ice core]]s, [[Proxy (climate)#Boreholes|borehole temperature]]s, and [[glacier]] length records are correlated with climatic fluctuations. From these, proxy temperature reconstructions of the last 2000 years have been performed for the northern hemisphere, and over shorter time scales for the southern hemisphere and tropics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Geographic coverage by these proxies is necessarily sparse, and various proxies are more sensitive to faster fluctuations. For example, tree rings, ice cores, and corals generally show variation on an annual time scale, but borehole reconstructions rely on [[Thermal diffusivity|rates of thermal diffusion]], and small scale fluctuations are washed out. Even the best proxy records contain far fewer observations than the worst periods of the observational record, and the spatial and temporal resolution of the resulting reconstructions is correspondingly coarse. Connecting the measured proxies to the variable of interest, such as temperature or rainfall, is highly non-trivial. Data sets from multiple complementary proxies covering overlapping time periods and areas are reconciled to produce the final reconstructions.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years ''Surface temperature reconstructions for the last 2,000 years'' (2006), National Academies Press {{ISBN|978-0-309-10225-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael E.

Proxy reconstructions extending back 2,000 years have been performed, but reconstructions for the last 1,000 years are supported by more and higher quality independent data sets. These reconstructions indicate:&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years ''Surface temperature reconstructions for the last 2,000 years'' (2006), National Academies Press {{ISBN|978-0-309-10225-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* global mean surface temperatures over the last 25 years have been higher than any comparable period since AD 1600, and probably since AD 900
* there was a [[Little Ice Age]] centered on AD 1700
* there was a [[Medieval Warm Period]] centered on AD 1000, though the exact timing and magnitude are uncertain and may have shown regional variation.

=== Indirect historical proxies ===

As well as natural, numerical proxies (tree-ring widths, for example) there exist records from the human historical period that can be used to infer climate variations, including: reports of [[frost fair]]s on the [[Thames]]; records of good and bad harvests; dates of spring blossom or lambing; extraordinary falls of rain and snow; and unusual floods or droughts.&lt;ref&gt;O.Muszkat, ''The outline of the problems and methods used for research of the history of the climate in the Middle Ages'', (in polish), Przemyśl 2014, {{ISSN|1232-7263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such records can be used to infer historical temperatures, but generally in a more qualitative manner than natural proxies.

Recent evidence suggests that a sudden and short-lived [[4.2 kiloyear event|climatic shift between 2200 and 2100 BCE]] occurred in the region between [[Tibet]] and [[Iceland]], with some evidence suggesting a global change.  The result was a cooling and reduction in precipitation.  This is believed to be a primary cause of the collapse of the [[Old Kingdom]] of [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/apocalypse_egypt_04.shtml The Fall of the Egyptian Old Kingdom] Hassan, Fekri BBC June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Paleoclimatology}}
Many estimates of past temperatures have been made over [[History of Earth|Earth's history]].  The field of paleoclimatology includes ancient temperature records.  As the present article is oriented toward recent temperatures, there is a focus here on events since the retreat of the [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciers]].  The 10,000 years of the [[Holocene]] epoch covers most of this period, since the end of the Northern Hemisphere's [[Younger Dryas]] millennium-long cooling.  The [[Holocene Climatic Optimum]] was generally warmer than the 20th century, but numerous regional variations have been noted since the start of the Younger Dryas.

== Ice cores (from 800,000 years before present) ==
[[File:EPICA temperature plot.svg|thumb|400px|Temperature estimates relative to today from over 800,000 years of the EPICA ice cores in Antarctica. Today's date is on the right side of the graph.]]
Even longer term records exist for few sites: the recent Antarctic [[European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica|EPICA]] core reaches 800 kyr; many others reach more than 100,000 years. The EPICA core covers eight glacial/interglacial cycles. The [[North Greenland Ice Core Project|NGRIP]] core from Greenland stretchs back more than 100 kyr, with 5 kyr in the [[Eemian interglacial]]. Whilst the large-scale signals from the cores are clear, there are problems interpreting the detail, and connecting the isotopic variation to the temperature signal.

{{main|Geologic temperature record}}
On longer time scales, sediment cores show that the cycles of glacials and interglacials are part of a deepening phase within a prolonged ice age that began with the glaciation of [[Antarctica]] approximately 40 million years ago.  This deepening phase, and the accompanying cycles, largely began approximately 3 million years ago with the growth of continental ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere.  Gradual changes in Earth's climate of this kind have been frequent during the Earth's 4500 million year existence and most often are attributed to changes in the configuration of continents and ocean sea ways.

==Branches==
There are currently three branches at several places in West Bengal where people working in different fields of astrophysics: Malda, Coochbehar, and Midnapore.

==Faculties and departments==
ICSP has four major departments working on several branches of astrophysics and related subjects.

===Instrumentation for Space Exploration===
Space exploration by means of balloon borne detectors is the main concern of this department. ICSP has pioneered in this field of low cost exploration of near earth space using light weight payloads on board weather balloons. In the course of the experiments ICSP payloads has visited the space more than 100 times and has gathered a multitude of data from extraterrestrial radiation sources, atmospheric radiation data due to cosmic ray interactions and other atmospheric data. These data has provided new understandings about the cosmic radiation sources as well as the radiation effects on the earth atmosphere.

===Astrochemistry and astrobiology===

===Ionospheric sciences===
The main research activities of this department includes study on solar-terrestrial environment including solar disturbances, Earth’s magnetosphere, ionosphere, thermosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere etc. Peoples also work on seismo-ionospheric precursors, lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling processes, long-term and transient solar activity and ionospheric climatology using both ground and space based VLF receiver. Monitoring of galactic X-ray transients, Soft Gamma ray Repeaters (SGRs) and Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) etc. are also active research topic in this department.

===High energy astrophysics===
This department mainly deals with Black Hole astrophysics. There are two branches of black hole astrophysics: Theoretical and Observational.

==Activities and collaborations==
ICSP is collaborating with several national and international institutions and universities. It is a member of Erasmus Mundus joint PhD programme in astronomy funded by European Union. Several of its scientists have been trained at [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics|ICTP]] (The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics), Italy. Scientist from ICSP has been taken part in the Antarctica expeditions. In the balloon borne science mission, this institute has been visited the near space for more than 100 times.

{{Architecture of Italy}}
'''Italian Baroque architecture''' refers to [[baroque architecture]] in [[Italy]].

==Central Italy==
===Rome===
[[File:Palazzo Barberini at night.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Palazzo Barberini]] at night.]]
The sacred architecture of the Baroque period had its beginnings in the Italian [[paradigm]] of the [[basilica]] with [[crossed dome]] and [[nave]]. One of the first Roman structures to break with the [[Mannerist]] conventions exemplified in [[Church of the Gesu|the Gesù]], was the church of [[Santa Susanna]], designed by [[Carlo Maderno]] in 1596. The dynamic rhythm of columns and pilasters, central massing, and the protrusion and condensed central decoration add complexity to the structure. There is an incipient playfulness with the rules of classic design, still maintaining rigor. They had domed roofs.

The same emphasis on plasticity, continuity and dramatic effects is evident in the work of [[Pietro da Cortona]], illustrated by [[San Luca e Santa Martina]] (1635) and [[Santa Maria della Pace]] (1656). The latter building, with concave wings devised to simulate a theatrical set, presses forward to fill a tiny piazza in front of it. Other Roman ensembles of the period are likewise suffused with theatricality, dominating the surrounding cityscape as a sort of theatrical environment.

Probably the best known example of such an approach is trapezoidal [[Saint Peter's Square]], which has been praised as a masterstroke of Baroque theatre. The square is shaped by two colonnades, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] on an unprecedented colossal scale to suit the space and provide emotions of awe. Bernini's own favourite design was the polychromatic oval church of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]] (1658), which, with its lofty altar and soaring dome, provides a concentrated sampling of the new architecture. His idea of the Baroque townhouse is typified by the [[Palazzo Barberini]] (1629) and [[Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi]] (1664), both in Rome.

[[File:RomaSIvoSapienzaCupola.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]]: [[Francesco Borromini]]]]

Bernini's chief rival in the papal capital was [[Francesco Borromini]], whose designs deviate from the regular compositions of the ancient world and Renaissance even more dramatically. Acclaimed by later generations as a revolutionary in architecture, Borromini condemned the anthropomorphic approach of the 16th century, choosing to base his designs on complicated geometric figures (modules). Borromini's architectural space seems to expand and contract when needed, showing some affinity with the late style of [[Michelangelo]]. His iconic masterpiece is the diminutive church of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]], distinguished by a corrugated oval plan and complex convex-concave rhythms. A later work, [[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]], displays the same antipathy to the flat surface and playful inventiveness, epitomized by a corkscrew lantern dome.

Following the death of Bernini in 1680, [[Carlo Fontana]] emerged as the most influential architect working in [[Rome]]. His early style is exemplified by the slightly concave façade of [[San Marcello al Corso]]). Fontana's academic approach, though lacking in the dazzling inventiveness of his Roman predecessors, exerted substantial influence on Baroque architecture both through his prolific writings and through a number of architects whom he trained and who would disseminate the Baroque idioms throughout 18th-century Europe.

The 18th century saw the capital of Europe's architectural world transferred from Rome to [[Paris]]. The Italian [[Rococo]], which flourished in Rome from the 1720s onward, was profoundly influenced by the ideas of Borromini. The most talented architects active in Rome — [[Francesco de Sanctis (architect)|Francesco de Sanctis]] ([[Spanish Steps]], 1723) and [[Filippo Raguzzini]] ([[Piazza Sant'Ignazio]], 1727) — had little influence outside their native country, as did numerous practitioners of the [[Sicilian Baroque]], including [[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]], [[Andrea Palma]], and [[Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia]].

==Southern Italy==

===Naples===
[[File:Reggia di Caserta.png|right|200px|thumb|The Baroque [[Palace of Caserta]] in [[Caserta]], near Naples.]]
The last phase of Baroque architecture in Italy is exemplified by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]]'s [[Caserta Palace]], reputedly the largest building erected in Europe in the 18th century. Indebted to contemporary French and Spanish models, the palace is skillfully related to the landscape. At Naples and Caserta, Vanvitelli practiced a sober classicizing academic style, with equal attention to [[aesthetics]] and engineering, a style that would make an easy transition to [[Neoclassicism]].

===Sicily===
{{main|Sicilian Baroque}}
[[File:Duomo San Giorgio.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The baroque Duomo of San Giorgio in [[Ragusa, Italy]], on the island of Sicily.]]
[[Sicilian Baroque]] is the distinctive form of [[Baroque architecture]] that took hold on the island of [[Sicily]], off the southern coast of Italy, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The style is recognizable not only by its typical Baroque curves and flourishes, but also by its grinning [[mask]]s and [[putto|putti]] and a particular flamboyance that has given Sicily a unique architectural identity.

The Sicilian Baroque style came to fruition during a major surge of rebuilding following a massive [[1693 Sicily earthquake|earthquake in 1693]]. Previously, the Baroque style had been used on the island in a naïve and [[parochialism|parochial]] manner, having evolved from [[Cross-genre|hybrid]] native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural [[engraving]]s that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence in their use of the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly-fashionable [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]].

The highly decorative Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, and perfectly reflected the [[social order]] of the island at a time when, nominally ruled by Spain, it was in fact governed by a wealthy and often extravagant [[aristocracy]] into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy was highly concentrated. Its Baroque architecture gives the island an architectural character that has lasted into the 21st century.

==North Italy==

===Turin===
[[File:Mg-k Basilica Superga1.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Basilica di Superga near [[Turin]]: [[Filippo Juvarra]]]]
In the north of Italy, notably [[Turin]], the monarchs from the [[House of Savoy]] were particularly receptive to the new style. They employed a brilliant triad of architects—[[Guarino Guarini]], [[Filippo Juvarra]] and [[Bernardo Vittone]]—to illustrate the grandiose political ambitions and the newly acquired royal status of their dynasty.

Guarini was a peripatetic monk who combined many traditions (including that of [[Gothic architecture]]) to create irregular structures remarkable for their oval columns and unconventional façades. Building upon the findings of contemporary geometry and [[stereotomy (architecture)|stereotomy]], Guarini elaborated the concept of ''architectura obliqua'', which approximated Borromini's style in both theoretical and structural audacity. Guarini's [[Palazzo Carignano]] (1679) may have been the most flamboyant application of the Baroque style to the design of a private house in the 17th century.

Fluid forms, weightless details and airy prospects of Juvarra's architecture anticipated the art of [[Rococo]]. Although his practice ranged well beyond [[Turin]], Juvarra's most arresting designs were created for [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia]]. The visual impact of his [[Basilica di Superga]] (1717) derives from its soaring roofline and masterful placement on a hill above Turin. Rustic ambience encouraged a freer articulation of architectural form at the royal hunting lodge of the [[Palazzina di Stupinigi]] (1729). Juvarra finished his short but eventful career in Madrid, where he worked on the royal palaces at [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]] and [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Aranjuez]].

Among the many who were profoundly influenced by the brilliance and diversity of Juvarra and Guarini none was more important than [[Bernardo Vittone]]. This Piedmontese architect is remembered for an outcrop of flamboyant [[Rococo]] churches, quatrefoil in plan and delicate in detailing. His sophisticated designs often feature multiple vaults, structures within structures and domes within domes.

===Milan===
[[File:IMG 4512 - Milano - Palazzo Litta - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 20-jan 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The baroque [[Palazzo Litta]] in Milan.]]
[[Francesco Maria Richini]] (1584-1658) was the most important [[Milan]]ese architect.&lt;ref name="Diz"&gt;N. Pevsner, J. Fleming, H. Honour, ''Dizionario di architettura'', cit., voce ''Richini, Francesco Maria''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1607 and 1630 he built the Church of [[San Giuseppe (Milan)|San Giuseppe]], which, like [[Chiesa del Gesù]] in Rome, was meant to practice the excess over the Mannerist academic vogue until then.&lt;ref name="Diz"/&gt;
Richini introduced a combined plan, consisting of two central areas derived from Chiesa di [[Sant'Alessandro in Zebedia|Sant' Alessandro]], also in Milan; the plastic effect is also noticeable in the façade, decorated by a series of overlapping niches.

Subsequently, in 1627 he devoted himself to the façade of the [[Palazzo del Senato (Milan)|Collegio Elvetico]] (now the seat of ''Archivio di Stato''), where he aimed at an integration between the interior and exterior through a concave prospectus. This interesting solution, possibly the first curved façade of the Baroque period, predates certain themes later expressed by Borromini, and confirms Richini as one of the greatest architects of the early Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;C. Norberg - Schulz, ''Architettura Barocca'', cit., p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venice===
[[Image:Venedig s maria della salut.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute]], [[Venice]]]]

The Venetian Baroque, according to local practice,&lt;ref&gt;C. Norberg - Schulz, ''Architettura Barocca'', cit., p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; saw Baldassarre Longhena (1598–1682) as its principal exponent.&lt;ref&gt;N. Pevsner, J. Fleming, H. Honour, ''Dizionario di architettura'', cit., voce ''Longhena, Baldassarre''.&lt;/ref&gt; After the pestilence of 1630, he began the construction of the Church of Santa Maria della Salute, using a central plan. In the octagonal body of the basilica, Longhena added a sanctuary bordered on either side by two apses, similar to that adopted by [[Andrea Palladio]] in the Basilica del Santissimo Redentore; this solution strengthens the longitudinal axis of the temple, which in fact became the central body in the proper nave. The baroque style of the temple is evident in the conformation of the external mass, located along the Grand Canal: the octagonal body, covered by a large dome, is flanked by the crown of the shrine and two bell towers.

Longhena also worked within civic architecture: its [[Ca' Pesaro]] presents a seemingly conventional plan, but the play of light and shadows that are set on the richly ornate façade leads to a typically Baroque style.

In any case, the exasperation of Loghena's [[plastic arts|plastic art details]] peaked in the façade of Chiesa dell'Ospedaletto (completed in the 1670s), decorated with a fancifully and richly with atlantes, giant heads and lion masks.

===Genoa===
In Genoa, Baroque architecture, since the end of the 16th century, saw the construction of a series of large buildings that critics have deemed among the most important of the Italian landscape.&lt;ref&gt;N. Pevsner, J. Fleming, H. Honour, ''Dizionario di architettura'', cit., voce ''Italia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was the [[Palazzo Doria Tursi]], where the planimetric configuration of the vestibule, combined with the highest indoor garden through a wide staircase, declares the presence of a movement in depth.

This solution was taken up by [[Bartolomeo Bianco]] (1590 - 1657) in what may be considered his masterpiece:&lt;ref&gt;C. Norberg - Schulz, ''Architettura Barocca'', cit., p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; the college of the Jesuits, which later became the headquarters of the [[University of Genoa]] (1634, approximately). The building has a U-shaped plan, but compared to previous one shows greater permeability between the inside and the yard; in fact, using the conformation of the very steep terrain, Bianco created a unique urban scenery, with a porch as wide as the yard and a series of overlapping arches and stairways.

==Biographical summary of works ==

Ostoga flourished between 1940 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;As recounted to Beverley Cranwell, 1991 {{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1940-1945'''

Ostoja studied drawing under Olgierd Vetesco in [[Przasnysz]] ([[Poland]]).

'''1945–1949'''

Ostoja completed studies at the [[Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts]] in Germany after winning a scholarship, and migrated to Australia.

Arriving in Melbourne, he enrolled at the Victorian School of Fine Arts National Gallery School under A. Summer and [[William Dargie]] and studied while he was working as a manual labourer.

'''1950-1955'''

Ostoja introduced the new abstract expression of Europe both to lecturers and students at the Victorian School of Art, Melbourne.

Settling in Stirling, in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia, he had his first one-man Exhibition at the Royal Society of Arts in Adelaide.

'''1956 - 1957'''

Ostoja collaborated with [http://www.adelaide.edu.au/library/special/mss/davidson/ Ian Davidson] in the production of the short film ''Five South Australian Artists'', and became involved in stage and theatre set design.

He co-produced several experimental films again with Ian Davidson, including ''The Quest of Time'' in 1957

Ostoja's work in abstract expression began to receive accolades. He won the Cornell Prize for the canvas "Form in Landscape", and designed the set for the play '[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'' by [[Luigi Pirandello]]

'''1958'''

The artist designed the set for the South Australian production of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''. He began to work with the [[Elder Conservatorium]] of [[University of Adelaide]], designing sets for [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[L'elisir d'amore|Elixir of Love]]'', employing startlingly new modified light settings and modulations.

'''1959'''

Ostoja won the [[Cornell Prize]] Exhibition of the Contemporary Arts Society of South Australia. He designed the set for ''The Egg'' and a new, light/colour abstract presentation for two performances of the South Australian Ballet Theatre. His innovative new techniques were then used by the [[Elder Conservatorium]] in their Opera Workshops.

'''1960'''

This year he designed sets for a new opera group which would eventually grow into the South Australian Opera Company. Among other theatrical events, he designed and executed the scenery for ''Moon on a Rainbow Shawl'' by Errol John, and ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (play)|The Teahouse of the August Moon]]'' by [[John Patrick (dramatist)|John Patrick]], (an Adelaide University Theatre Guild Production). He received artistic satisfaction but little financial reward for these efforts. In this year also, he staged a visual production on the theme of [[Orpheus]], using dance, music and voice with several projectors.

This was the first attempt at quadraphonic sound in Australia, and also the first demonstration of "Chromasonics" - the science of translating sound into visual images. Ostoja then designed innovative "abstracted" scenery for a production of ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[The Turn of the Screw (opera)|The Turn of the Screw]]''.

'''1961'''

Ostoja designed the sets for the controversial South Australian production of [[Patrick White]]'s ''Ham Funeral'' - also [[Alan Seymour]]'s ''Swamp Creatures'', both performed by the Adelaide University Theatre Guild. He designed and constructed six stained glass windows for the Refectory at Adelaide University, South Australia. In this period Ostoja designed special lights and gauzes for difficult effects required in an ambitious production of the opera ''[[Don Carlos]]'' by the Opera Workshop, for the Elder Conservatorium.

'''1962'''

Ostoja designed and built sets for the production of"J.S", by [[Archibald MacLeish]], for the second [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]]. He exhibited vitreous enamel works in Melbourne's Argus Gallery. [[Max Harris (poet)|Max Harris]], in ''[[The Bulletin]]'' of 20 October 1962, praised Ostoja's sets for ''My Cousin from Fiji'' in Union Theatre, Adelaide, and his technique of rear screen projections as later adopted throughout Australia.

'''1963'''

Ostoja continued to develop Multi-Image projections, demonstrating for the first time in Australia the concept later to be known as 'audio-visuals!'. Ostoja gave Sir Herbert Reed, the art critic, a personal viewing of one of his visual presentations. At Christmas, in the Elder Conservatorium, Ostoja gave what was probably the world's first "visual concert", using special projectors and incorporating music, colours and shapes.

'''1964'''

Ostoja co-designed a dance and stage production in Adelaide. For the Adelaide Festival of Arts of that year, he designed the largest light mosaic ever staged up to that time, upon the facade of an 11-storey building. Ostoja was invited to New Zealand, and exhibited the first electronically generated images in Australia in Melbourne, at the Argus Gallery. His extremely innovative design for the {{convert|60|ft|m|sing=on}} bass relif mural on the new B.P. building in Melbourne was the subject of a film which won the "Blue Ribbon" Award in the American Film Festival in New York.

'''1965'''

Ostoja designed and made the first light kinetic mural in Australia, and continued to evolve theatrical works using multi-screen and Multi-projector techniques. The Production of [[Jean Genet]]'s ''[[The Balcony]]'' was very controversial. with Elizabeth Dalman, Ostoja produced new dance forms for Melbourne Television. He introduced [[Op Art]] to Australia, both at South Yarra Gallery in Melbourne, and Gallery A in Sydney.

'''1966'''

With John Dallwitz, Ostoja was invited to present more "Sound and Image" experimental theatre. he incorporated Australian poetry into the sound, music, and visual images. The architect [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] commissioned Ostoja to design two large Op murals for the Australian Pavilion entrance at the [[Expo 67]]. Ostoja was awarded a [[Churchill Fellowship]], which enabled him to have extensive world travel, comparing art and technology in many countries. He began to work with language, contemporary poetry and prose, and computers.

'''1967'''

In Berne, Switzerland, Ostoja received the "[http://www.fiap.net/ Excellence F.I.A.P." Award] for innovative photography.

'''1968'''

At the Adelaide Festival of Arts, Ostoja staged the first combined 'Sound and Image" production in the world using a laser beam. This included the first science fiction play (by [[Ray Bradbury]]) performed in Australia. Ostoja's theatre methods were increasingly attracting the attention of critics to how plays were staged. "Chromasonics", developed and introduced by Ostoja, was now being used extensively in the entertainment industry.

'''1969'''

Ostoja staged [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Krzysztof Penderecki's ]] [[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]], a controversial, contemporary religious work. The South Australian ''[[The Advertiser (Australia)|The Advertiser]]'' wrote an extensive critique of Ostoja's work. [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] commissioned Ostoja to build a 'chromasonic" exhibit for the [[Expo '70]] in Osaka.

'''1970'''

Ostoja presented an Australian Aboriginal [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Dreamtime]] theme in his "Sound and Image" theatre, working with leading contemporary figures in poetry, music and dance. This was the first production of its kind in Australia, and appeared after the Festival in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra and Perth. Ostoja's "Space Scape" mural, sixty feet long by ten feet high, won the Australia wide competition for a mural for Adelaide Airport. His {{convert|120|ft|m}} high 'light and sound' structure for the Adelaide Festival was the first of its kind in the world.

'''1971'''

Ostoja awarded a Creative Arts Fellowship at the Australian National University [[Australian National University]], [[Canberra]]. His 18-month stay resulted in the design and building of a "Chromasonics unit-laser", a {{convert|100|ft|m}} Chromasonic tower, and a world premiere of a "Synchronos" concert.

'''1972'''

With [[Don Burrows]] and [[Don Banks]], Ostoja presented "Synchronos 72", where one could "hear the colours and see the sounds". Ostoja added "Cymatics" developed during the Fellowship to his workshop repertoire. He was invited to exhibit his photography in the National Gallery, Melbourne.

'''1973'''

Ostoja received a Fellowship from the Australian American Education Association to study art and technology in the U.S.A. He studied laser art and technology, using a newly developed material in his optical collages.

'''1974'''

Using several lasers, Ostoja designed sets and a special curtain for the complex work ''[[The Excursions of Mr. Brouček to the Moon and to the 15th Century|The Excursions of Mr. Brouček]]'' by [[Leoš Janáček|Janáček]], the first opera produced at the new Adelaide Festival Theatre complex.

'''1975'''

The artist 's "Laser - Chromasonics" (1972) and "Laser Chromasonic Tower Mark III" exhibited for the Festival of Creative Art and Sciences, Canberra. Ostoja commissioned to design a vitreous enamel mural for the Earth Science building, [[University of Melbourne]].

'''1976'''

Ostoja exhibited works in [[vitreous enamel]] on steel, optical collages, and for the first time in Australia, collages incorporating [[Kirlian photography]]. The Premier, [[Don Dunstan]], opened this exhibition at Lidum's Gallery, Adelaide. Ostoja's "Theremin 74", using electronics and stainless steel, purchased by the Tasmanian Art Gallery. Ostoja commissioned to produce a large bass relief mural for the new [[Nauru House]], in [[Melbourne]].

'''1977'''

Ostoja displayed exhibits of vitreous enamels, optical collages, and kinetics with six lasers at the Australian Galleries Exhibition in Melbourne. He was commissioned to undertake a feasibility study for a solar mural by Melbourne University [[University of Melbourne]].

'''1978'''

The artist's computer poem "Tidal Element" (the first computer poem composed in Australia) featured in a special issue of "Australian Literary Studies" (Adelaide University). Ostoja created a new Laser Chromasonic Tower, which produced kinetic laser images and incandescent lights, for the Royal Adelaide International Expo 78. Ostoja's experiments with an [[krypton laser|argon]] laser gave rise to a new organic image in his work laser images, including "Astroid" and "Harmonics".

'''1980'''

The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] produced a half-hour documentary on Ostoja's work, the program screening on 13 April 1980.

The Governor-General and his wife visited the artist's studio in Stirling. Christopher Hunt, Artistic Director of the 1980 Adelaide Festival of Arts, invited Ostoja to exhibit his laser kinetics in conjunction with a holographic exhibit from the New York Museum.

The show, "Futuresight", in the Melville Hall, Adelaide, was opened by Sir [[Mark Oliphant]].

The magazine ''[[Scientific Australian (1977)|Scientific Australian]]'' published an article on this exhibition in the No.4, Volume 4 Edition.

'''1981–1982'''

Ostoja prepared for an exhibition in Sydney, and became interested artistically in Australian jade. Commissioned by Dr Nina Christensen of Melbourne University to construct a jade window. At this Adelaide Festival of Arts he presented a different kind of laser concert. "Art in Australia", Vol. 19, No. 3 published an extensive article on Ostoja's works, covering a twenty-year period.

'''1983'''

[[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]] opened Ostoja's two major exhibitions at the Barry Stern Gallery, Sydney - one on optical collages, and a laser kinetics, music and sound exhibition. It is suggested that Ostoja donate his large, personal collection of photographs and a full documentation of his career, to Melbourne University's Australian Collection. The collection was subsequently deposited in the [http://www.lib.unimelb.edu.au/collections/buckland/  Baillieu Library].

'''1984'''

Ostoja used a vapour laser, then built by Quentron Optics in Adelaide. He presented a laser kinetics concert for the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060527113055/http://winterfest.ballarat.net.au/ Ballarat Festival].

'''1985'''

Using computer generated images, Ostoja staged a laser concert at Wayville Showgrounds, Adelaide, to celebrate the finale of the inaugural [[1985 Australian Grand Prix|Adelaide Grand Prix]]. [[Australia Post]] produced a stamp issue designed by Ostoja (using a laser), to launch the first Australian "electronic mail" system.

'''1986'''

Ostoja invited to stage a laser concert for the South Australian Jubilee Celebrations. He constructed the "Solaris", a continually changing, solar kinetic mural, at the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]]. Division of Applied Physics, Lindfield, N.S.W, and was invited to exhibit it at [[Expo '88]] in Brisbane.

'''1987'''

Ostoja redesigned the shape of "Solaris" for the Brisbane Expo. For the Director of the new Scitech Discovery Centre [http://www.scitech.org.au/index.html], Perth, Ostoja designed, produced, and exhibited a work which reveals the effects of theremin and light.

'''1988 to 1989'''

[[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations included a project sponsored by the Polish community to honour the name of Australia's highest mountain, [[Mount Kosciuszko]]. In collaboration with sculptor John Dowie, Ostoja constructed a geometrical, stainless steel monument at the entrance to the town of [[Cooma, New South Wales]]. Reading about [[chaos theory]] and [[Benoît Mandelbrot|Professor Mandelbrot's]] "Beauty of Fractals", Ostoja began to work in this area. An article published in ''[[The Australian]]'', October 1989, revealed some of Ostoja's considerable output of work in the field of computer graphics in this new field.

'''1991-1993'''

Ostoja was invited by the [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra|National Philharmonic in Warsaw]], [[Poland]], Ostoja staged "SYNKRONOS" concert - workshop using 13 blue green and red lasers and incandescent lamps to translate works of traditional and contemporary composers into kinetic laser images and shapes.

In 1992 he was appointed a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] (AM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=870256&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true It's an Honour]. Retrieved 25 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1994'''

'''The Lee–Carter model''' is a numerical algorithm used in [[mortality forecasting]] and [[life expectancy]] [[forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soa.org/library/journals/north-american-actuarial-journal/2000/january/naaj0001_5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The input to the model is a matrix of age specific [[mortality rates]] ordered monotonically by time, usually with ages in columns and years in rows.  The output is another forecasted matrix of mortality rates.

The model uses the [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) to find a [[univariate]] [[time series]] vector "k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;" that captures 80–90% of the mortality trend (here the subscript "t" refers to time), a vector "b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;" that describes the amount of mortality change at a given age for a unit of yearly total mortality change (here the subscript "x" refers to age), and a scaling constant (referred to here as s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; but unnamed in the literature). Surprisingly, k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is usually linear, implying that gains to life expectancy are fairly constant year after year in most populations. Before being input to the SVD, age specific mortality rates are transformed into "a&lt;sub&gt;x,t&lt;/sub&gt;", by taking their [[logarithms]], and then [[centering]] them by subtracting their age-specific means (calculated over time).  (The subscript "x,t" refers to the fact that a&lt;sub&gt;x,t&lt;/sub&gt; spans both age and time.)  Many researchers adjust the k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; vector by fitting it to empirical life expectancies for each year, using the a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; just generated with the SVD; when adjusted using this approach, changes to k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; are usually small.

To forecast mortality, the above k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; (either adjusted or not) is projected into the future using [[ARIMA]] time series methods, the corresponding future a&lt;sub&gt;x,t+n&lt;/sub&gt; is recovered by multiplying k&lt;sub&gt;t+n&lt;/sub&gt; by b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and the appropriate diagonal element of S (when [U S V] = svd(mort)), and the actual  mortality rates are recovered by taking exponentials of this vector.  Because of the linearity of k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, it is generally modeled as a [[random walk]] with trend. Life expectancy and other [[life table]] measures can be calculated from this forecasted matrix after adding back the means and taking exponentials to yield regular mortality rates.

In most implementations, [[confidence intervals]] for the forecasts are generated by simulating multiple mortality forecasts using [[Monte-Carlo]] methods; a band of mortality between 5% and 95% percentiles of the simulated results is considered to be a valid forecast.  These simulations are done by extending k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; into the future using randomization based on the [[standard error]] of k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; derived from the input data.

In outline and [[Matlab]]-style pseudocode, the algorithm is as follows:

#
# Create a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; by taking [[logarithms]] of the mortality rates and centering the results with the average log mortality at a given age.
# Derive k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, a scaling eigenvalue, and b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; from  U(:,1), S(1,1), V(1,:), where [U S V] = svd(mort).
# Forecast k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; with standard univariate [[ARIMA]] methods.
# Use the forecast k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; with the original b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; to calculate logged mortality rates for each forecast year.
# Recover regular mortality rates by calculating the exponential of the forecasted log mortality rates. 
#

Without applying SVD or some other method of [[dimension reduction]] the table of mortality data is a highly correlated multivariate data series; the complexity of these multidimensional time series makes such them almost impossible to forecast.  SVD has become widely used as a method of dimension reduction in many disparate fields, including by [[Google]] in their [[page rank]] algorithm.

The Lee–Carter model was introduced by [[Ronald D. Lee]] and Lawrence Carter in 1992 with the article "Modeling and Forecasting the Time Series of U.S. Mortality," (Journal of the American Statistical Association 87 (September): 659–671).&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/samclark/soc533/Syllabus/Readings/7/1/Lee-R-etal_1992_Modeling-Forecasting-US-Mortality.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The model grew out of their work in the late 1980s and early 1990s attempting to use [[inverse projection]] to infer rates in [[historical demography]].&lt;ref&gt;http://escholarship.org/uc/item/76b3712p&lt;/ref&gt; The model has been used by the United States [[Social Security Administration]], the US [[Census Bureau]], and the United Nations.  It has become the most widely used mortality forecasting technique in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;http://gking.harvard.edu/files/lc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been extensions to the Lee–Carter, most notably to account for missing years, correlated male and female populations, and large scale coherency in populations that share a mortality regime (western Europe, for example).  Many related papers can be found on [http://www.ceda.berkeley.edu/People/rlee.html Professor Ronald Lee's] website.

There are surprisingly few software packages for forecasting with the Lee-Carter Model.  [http://lcfit.demog.berkeley.edu LCFIT] is a web-based package with interactive forms.  Professor [[Rob J. Hyndman]] provides an [http://robjhyndman.com/software/demography/  R package for demography] that includes routines for creating and forecasting a Lee-Carter Model. Professor German Rodriguez provides [http://data.princeton.edu/eco572/LeeCarter.html code for the Lee-Carter Model] using [[Stata]]. Using [[Matlab]], Professor Eric Jondeau and Professor Michael Rockinger have put together the [https://github.com/mrockinger/Matlab-Longevity-Toolbox/ Longevity Toolbox] for parameter estimation.

==Stand-alone application software==
Software that supports arbitrary precision computations:

*[[bc (programming language)|bc]] the [[POSIX]] arbitrary-precision arithmetic language that comes standard on most [[Unix-like]] systems.
**[[dc (computer program)|dc]]: "Desktop Calculator" arbitrary-precision RPN calculator that comes standard on most [[Unix-like]] systems.
*[[KCalc]], Linux based scientific calculator
*[[Maxima (software)|Maxima]]: a [[computer algebra system]] which ''bignum'' integers are directly inherited from its implementation language [[Common Lisp]]. In addition, it supports arbitrary-precision floating-point numbers, ''bigfloats''.
*[[Maple (language)|Maple]], [[Mathematica]], and several other [[computer algebra]] software include arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Mathematica employs [[GNU Multi-Precision Library|GMP]] for approximate number computation.
*[[PARI/GP]], an [[Open-source software|open source]] computer algebra system that supports arbitrary precision.
*[[SageMath]], an open-source [[computer algebra system]]
*[[SymPy]], a CAS
*Symbolic Math toolbox ([[MATLAB]])
*[http://oroptimizer.com/smartxml SmartXML], a free programming language with integrated development environment (IDE) for mathematical calculations. Variables of BigNumber type can be used, or regular numbers can be converted to big numbers using conversion operator # (e.g., #2.3^2000.1). SmartXML big numbers can have up to 100,000,000 decimal digits and up to 100,000,000 whole digits.
**The SmartXML program file editor supports [[autocomplete|code completion]] and most typing is replaced by code completion. Only minimal typing is required when writing a program. Other than constant values, such as 5 or 'Some Text', everything else is supported by code completion.
**Operations with big numbers are done using operators, such as +, -, *, /, ^, etc. (e.g., (#2.3^2000.3 / #2.3^1999.3 - 1)).
**SmartXML maintains pool of big numbers, from which big numbers are retrieved (i.e., when there are used in code), and the numbers are released back to the pool, when a big number goes out of scope. The programmer does not have to worry about retrieving or releasing big numbers, since it is done internally by SmartXML.
*[[Windows Calculator]], since Windows 98, uses arbitrary precision for basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and 32 digits of precision for advanced operations (square root, transcendental functions).

==Languages==
Programming languages that supports arbitrary precision computations, either built-in, or in the standard library of the language:

The ''Decimal'' class in the standard library module ''decimal'' has user definable precision and limited mathematical operations (exponentiation, square root, etc. but no trigonometric functions). The ''Fraction'' class in the module ''fractions'' implements rational numbers. More extensive arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic is available with the third-party "mpmath" and "bigfloat" packages.
*[[Racket (programming language)|Racket]]: the built-in ''exact'' numbers are of arbitrary precision. Example: (expt 10 100) produces the expected (large) result. Exact numbers also include rationals, so (/ 3 4) produces 3/4.

[[Image:Former Delft School of Microbiology.jpg|thumb|The Laboratory of Microbiology in [[Delft]], where Beijerinck worked from 1897 to 1921.]]

'''Martinus Willem Beijerinck''' (16 March 1851 – 1 January 1931) was a Dutch [[microbiologist]] and [[botanist]]. He is often considered one of the founders of [[history of virology|virology]] and [[environmental microbiology]]. In spite of his numerous pioneering and seminal contributions to science in general, he was never awarded the [[Nobel Prize]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Amsterdam]], Beijerinck studied at the Technical School of Delft, where he was awarded the degree of Chemical Engineer in 1872. He obtained his Doctor of Science degree from the [[University of Leiden]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Chung |first1 = K. T. |last2 = Ferris |first2 = D.

At the time, Delft, then a [[List of institutions using the term "institute of technology" or "polytechnic"|Polytechnic]], did not have the right to confer doctorates, so Leiden did this for them. He became a teacher in microbiology at the Agricultural School in Wageningen (now [[Wageningen University]]) and later at the ''Polytechnische Hogeschool Delft'' ([[Delft]] [[Institute of technology#Belgium and the Netherlands|Polytechnic]], currently [[Delft University of Technology]]) (from 1895). He established the Delft School of Microbiology. His studies of agricultural and industrial microbiology yielded fundamental discoveries in the field of [[biology]]. His achievements have been perhaps unfairly overshadowed by those of his contemporaries, [[Robert Koch]] and [[Louis Pasteur]], because unlike them, Beijerinck never studied human disease.

In 1885 he became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00001421 |title=Martinus Willem Beijerinck (1851 - 1931) |publisher=[[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |date= |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific contributions==
He is considered one of the founders of [[virology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Lustig |first1 = Alice |last2 = Levine |first2 = Arnold J. | title = One Hundred Years of Virology | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 66 | issue = 8 | pages = 4629–4631 | year = 1992 |location = Washington, D.C.| pmc=241285 | pmid=1629947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bos| first1 = L. | year = 1995 | title = The Embryonic Beginning of Virology: Unbiased Thinking and Dogmatic Stagnation | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 140 | pages = 613–619 | doi=10.1007/bf01718437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Zaitlin| first = Milton | editor1-last = Kung| editor1-first = S.

Beijerinck, nevertheless, set the stage for twentieth-century virologists to uncover the secrets of viral pathogens now known to cause a wide range of plant and animal (including human) diseases}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, he published results on the filtration experiments demonstrating that [[tobacco mosaic disease]] is caused by an infectious agent smaller than a [[bacterium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beijerinck | first = M. W. | title = Über ein Contagium vivum fluidum als Ursache der Fleckenkrankheit der Tabaksblätter | journal = Verhandelingen der Koninklijke akademie van Wetenschappen te Amsterdam | volume = 65 | pages = 1–22 | year = 1898 | language = German}} Translated into English in Johnson, J., Ed. (1942) ''Phytopathological classics.'' (St. Paul, Minnesota: American Phytopathological Society) No. 7, pp. 33–52 (St. Paul, Minnesota)&lt;/ref&gt;

His results were in accordance with the similar observation made by [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Iwanowski | first = D. | title = Über die Mosaikkrankheit der Tabakspflanze | journal = Bulletin Scientifique publié par l'Académie Impériale des Sciences de Saint-Pétersbourg |series=Nouvelle Série III'' | volume = 35 | pages = 67–70 | location = St. Petersburg | year = 1892 | language = German, Russian}} Translated into English in Johnson, J., Ed. (1942) ''Phytopathological classics'' (St. Paul, Minnesota: American Phytopathological Society) No. 7, pp. 27–-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Ivanovsky before him and [[Adolf Mayer]], predecessor at Wageningen, Beijerinck could not culture the filterable infectious agent, however he concluded that the agent can replicate and multiply in living plants. He named the new [[pathogen]] ''[[virus]]'' to indicate its non-bacterial nature. Beijerinck asserted that the virus was somewhat liquid in nature, calling it "''[[contagium vivum fluidum]]''" (contagious living fluid). It was not until the first crystals of the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV) obtained by [[Wendell Stanley]] in 1935, the first electron micrographs of TMV produced in 1939 and the first X-ray crystallographic analysis of TMV performed in 1941 proved that the virus was particulate.

Beijerinck also discovered [[nitrogen fixation]],&lt;ref&gt;Beijerinck, M.W, 1901, ''Über oligonitrophile Mikroben, Centralblatt für Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde, Infektionskrankheiten und Hygiene, Abteilung II, Vol 7'', pp. 561–582&lt;/ref&gt; the process by which diatomic [[nitrogen]] gas is converted to [[ammonium]] ions and becomes available to plants. Bacteria perform nitrogen fixation, dwelling inside [[root nodules]] of certain plants ([[legume]]s). In addition to having discovered a biochemical reaction vital to [[soil]] fertility and [[agriculture]], Beijerinck revealed this archetypical example of [[symbiosis]] between [[plants]] and [[bacteria]].

Beijerinck discovered the phenomenon of bacterial [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate reduction]], a form of [[anaerobic respiration]]. He learned bacteria could use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor, instead of oxygen. This discovery has had an important impact on our current understanding of [[biogeochemical cycles]]. ''[[Spirillum|Spirillum desulfuricans]]'', now known as ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bacterio.net/desulfovibrio.html |title=Genus ''Desulfovibrio'' |last1=Jean |first1=Euzeby |date= |website= |publisher=[[List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]] |accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first known sulfate-reducing bacterium, was isolated and described by Beijerinck.

Beijerinck invented the [[enrichment culture]], a fundamental method of studying [[microbe]]s from the environment. He is often incorrectly credited with framing the microbial ecology idea that "everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects", which was stated by [[Lourens Baas Becking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Wit R, Bouvier T. |title=Everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects; what did Baas Becking and Beijerinck really say? |journal=Environmental Microbiology |year=2006 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=755–758 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01017.x |pmid=16584487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Bass-Becking |first=Lourens G.M.|year=1934 |location=[[The Hague]]| publisher=W.P. Van Stockum &amp; Zoon |title=Geobiologie of inleiding tot de milieukunde }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Beijerinck was a socially eccentric figure. He was verbally abusive to students, never married, and had few professional collaborations. He was also known for his [[ascetic]] lifestyle and his view of science and [[marriage]] being incompatible. His low popularity with his students and their parents periodically depressed him, as he very much loved spreading his enthusiasm for biology in the classroom.

==Recognition==
[[Beijerinckia]] (a genus of bacteria), [[Beijerinckiaceae]] (a family of [[Rhizobiales]]), and [[Beijerinck (crater)]] are named after him.

'''Moral Development''' focuses on the emergence, change, and understanding of [[morality]] from infancy through adulthood. Morality develops across a lifetime and is influenced by an individual's experiences and their behavior when faced with moral issues through different periods' physical and cognitive development. In short, morality concerns an individual's growing sense of what is right and wrong; it is for this reason that young children have different moral judgement and character than that of a grown adult. Morality in itself is often a synonym for "rightness" or "goodness". It refers to a certain code of conduct that is derived from one's culture, religion or personal philosophy that guides one's actions, behaviors and thoughts.  

Notions of morality development have been developed over centuries, the earliest came from philosophers like [[Confucius]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], who all took a more humanist perspective and focused on the development of the conscience and sense of virtue. In the modern day, empirical research has explored morality through a moral psychology lens by theorists like [[Sigmund Freud]] and its relation to cognitive development by theorists like [[Jean Piaget]], [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[B. F. Skinner]], [[Carol Gilligan]] and Judith Smetana.  

The interest in morality spans many disciplines (e.g., [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[biology]], and [[political science]]) and specializations within psychology (e.g., [[Social psychology|social]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[Cultural psychology|cultural]]). In order to investigate how individuals understand morality, it is essential to consider their beliefs, emotions, attitudes, and behaviors that contribute to their moral understanding. Additionally, researchers in the field of moral development consider the role of peers and parents in facilitating moral development, the role of conscience and values, socialization and cultural influences, empathy and altruism, and positive development, in order to understand what factors impact morality of an individual more completely.

==Historical background and foundational theories ==
[[File:Confuscious Down Under (5022724040).jpg|thumb|

]]

'''Freud: Morality and the Superego:''' The founder of psychoanalysis, [[Sigmund Freud]], proposed the existence of a tension between the needs of society and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Eli. ''Freud, Women, and Morality: The Psychology of Good and Evil''. New York: Basic Books, 1988. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Freud, moral development proceeds when the individual's selfish desires are repressed and replaced by the values of important socializing agents in one's life (for instance, one's parents).

'''B.F. Skinner's Behavioral Theory:''' A proponent of behaviorism, [[B. F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner]] similarly focused on socialization as the primary force behind moral development&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Driscoll, Marcy Perkins. ''Psychology of Learning for Instruction''. Pearson, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;. In contrast to Freud's notion of a struggle between internal and external forces, Skinner focused on the power of external forces (reinforcement contingencies) to shape an individual's development.

'''Piaget's Theory of Moral Development''' : While both Freud and Skinner focused on the external forces that bear on morality (parents in the case of Freud, and behavioral contingencies in the case of Skinner), [[Jean Piaget]] (1965) focused on the individual's construction, construal, and interpretation of morality from a social-cognitive and social-emotional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, Jean, Ved P. Varma, and Phillip Williams. ''Piaget, Psychology and Education: Papers in Honour of Jean Piaget''. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;To understand adult morality, Piaget believed that it was necessary to study both how morality manifests in the child's world as well as the factors that contribute to the emergence of central moral concepts such as welfare, justice, and rights. Interviewing children using the Clinical Interview Method, Piaget (1965) found that young children were focused on authority mandates, and that with age children become autonomous, evaluating actions from a set of independent principles of morality. Piaget characterizes the development of morality of children through observing children while playing games to see if rules are followed.
[[File:Jean Piaget in Ann Arbor.png|thumb|212x212px|[[Jean Piaget]].]]

'''Social Domain Theory:''' Eliot Turiel  argued for a social domain approach to social cognition, delineating how individuals differentiate moral (fairness, equality, justice), societal (conventions, group functioning, traditions), and psychological (personal, individual prerogative) concepts from early in development throughout the lifespan&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, Elliot. ''The Culture of Morality: Social Development, Context, and Conflict''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. Internet resource.&lt;/ref&gt;. Over the past 40 years, research findings have supported this model, demonstrating how children, adolescents, and adults differentiate moral rules from conventional rules, identify the personal domain as a nonregulated domain, and evaluate multifaceted (or complex) situations that involve more than one domain. This research has been conducted in a wide range of countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Nigeria, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, U.K., U.S., Virgin Islands) and with rural and urban children, for low and high income communities, and traditional and modern cultures. Turiel's social domain theory showed that children were actually younger in developing moral standards than past psychologists predicted.

'''Kohlberg: Moral Reasoning'':''''' [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] was inspired by the works of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohlberg, Lawrence. ''The Philosophy of Moral Development: Moral Stages and the Idea of Justice''. San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1981. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the past 20 years, researchers have expanded the field of moral development, applying moral judgment, reasoning, and emotion attribution to topics such as prejudice, aggression, theory of mind, emotions, empathy, peer relationships, and parent-child interactions. The Handbook of Moral Development (2006), edited by Melanie Killen and Judith Smetana, provides a wide range of information about these topics covered in moral development today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Smetana, J.G. (Eds.) (2006). Handbook of moral development. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;One of the main objectives was to provide a sense of the current state of the field of moral development

==Cognition and intentionality==

A hallmark of moral understanding is intentionality which can be defined as an attribution of the target’s intentions towards another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Rizzo|first2=Michael T.|date=2014|title=Morality, Intentionality, and Intergroup Attitudes |journal=Behaviour|volume=151|issue=2–3|pages=337–359|doi=10.1163/1568539X-00003132 |pmc=4336952|pmid=25717199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five components make up people's concept of intentionality: an action is considered intentional if a personal has (a) a desire for an outcome, (b) a belief that the action will lead to the outcome, (c) an intention to perform the action, (d) skill to perform the action, and (e) awareness while performing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://research.clps.brown.edu/SocCogSci/Projects/intentionality.html|title=Intentionality {{!}} Malle Lab|website=research.clps.brown.edu|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research on children's [[theory of mind]], ToM, has focused on when children understand others' intentions (Wellman &amp; Lui, 2004&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, H. M., &amp; Liu, D. (2004). Scaling of theory-of-mind tasks. ''Child Development'', 75, 502-517.&lt;/ref&gt;). The moral concept of one's intentionality develops with experience in the world. Yuill (1984) presented evidence that comprehension of one's intentions plays a role in moral judgment, even in young children.&lt;ref&gt;Yuill, N. (1984). Young children's coordination of motive and outcome in judgments of satisfaction and morality. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 2, 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen, Mulvey, Richardson, Jampol, and [[Amanda Woodward|Woodward]] (2011) present evidence that with developing false belief competence (ToM), children are capable of using information about one’s intentions when making moral judgments about the acceptability of acts and punishments, recognizing that accidental transgressors, who do not hold negative intentions, should not be held accountable for negative outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Mulvey, K. L., Richardson, C., Jampol, N., &amp; Woodward, A. (2011). The accidental transgressor: Testing theory of mind and morality knowledge in young children. ''Cognition'', 119, 197-215.&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, children who lacked false belief competence were more likely to attribute blame to an accidental transgressor than children with demonstrated false belief competence. In addition to evidence from a social cognitive perspective, behavioral evidence suggests that even three-year-olds have the capacity to take into account a person's intention and apply this information when responding to situations. Vaish, Carpenter, and [[Michael Tomasello|Tomasello]] (2010), for instance, present evidence that three-year-olds are more willing to help a neutral or helpful person than a harmful person.&lt;ref&gt;Vaish, A., Carpenter, M., &amp; Tomasello, M. (2010). Young children selectively avoid helping people with harmful intentions. ''Child Development'', 81, 1661-1669.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the ability to identify one’s intentionality, mental state understanding plays a crucial role in identifying victimization. While obvious distress cues (e.g. crying) allow even three year olds to identify victims of harm (Zelazo, Helwig, &amp; Lau, 1996&lt;ref&gt;Zelazo, P. D., Helwig, C. C., &amp; Lau, A. (1996). Intention, act, and outcome in behavioral prediction and moral judgment. ''Child Development'', 67, 2478-2492.&lt;/ref&gt;), it is not until around six years of age that children are able to appreciate that a person may be an unwilling victim of harm even in the absence of obvious distress (Shaw &amp; Wainryb, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, L. A., &amp; Wainryb, C. (2006). When victims don't cry: Children's understandings of victimization, compliance, and subversion. ''Child Development'', 77, 1050-1062.&lt;/ref&gt; In their study, Shaw and Wainryb (2006) discovered that children older than six interpret compliance, resistance, and subversion to illegitimate requests (e.g., clean my locker) from the perspective of a victim. That is, they judge that victims who resist illegitimate requests will feel better than victims who comply.

==Emotions==

Moral questions tend to be emotionally charged issues which evoke strong affective responses. Consequently, emotions likely play an important role in moral development. However, there is currently little consensus among theorists on how emotions influence moral development. [[Psychoanalytic theory]], founded by Freud, emphasizes the role of guilt in repressing primal drives. Research on [[prosocial behavior]] has focused on how emotions motivate individuals to engage in moral or altruistic acts. Social-cognitive development theories have recently begun to examine how emotions influence moral judgments. Intuitionist theorists assert that moral judgments can be reduced to immediate, instinctive emotional responses elicited by moral dilemmas.

Research on socioemotional development and prosocial development has identified several "moral emotions" which are believed to motivate moral behavior and influence moral development (Eisenberg, 2000 for a review).&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N. (2000). Emotion, Regulation, and Moral Development. ''Annual Review of Psychology'', 51,665–697.&lt;/ref&gt; These moral emotions are said to be linked to moral development because they are evidence and reflective of an individual’s set of moral values, which must have undergone through the process of internalization in the first place (Kochanska &amp; Thompson, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kochanska|first=Grazyna|last2=Aksan|first2=Nazan|date=2006-12-01|title=Children's Conscience and Self-Regulation|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00421.x|journal=Journal of Personality|language=en|volume=74|issue=6|pages=1587–1618|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2006.00421.x|issn=1467-6494}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifestation of these moral emotions can occur at two separate timings: either before or after the execution of a moral or immoral act. A moral emotion that precedes an action is referred to as an anticipatory emotion, and a moral emotion that follows an action is referred to as a consequential emotion (Tangney, Stuewig, &amp; Mashek, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tangney|first=June Price|last2=Stuewig|first2=Jeff|last3=Mashek|first3=Debra J.|date=2006-12-06|title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=58|issue=1|pages=345–372|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145|issn=0066-4308|pmc=3083636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary emotions consistently linked with moral development are [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[empathy]], and [[sympathy]]. Guilt has been defined as "an agitation-based emotion or painful feeling of regret that is aroused when the actor actually causes, anticipates causing, or is associated with an aversive event" (Fergusen &amp; Stegge, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson T. J. &amp; Stegge H. (1998). Measuring guilt in children: a rose by any other name still has thorns. In Guilt and Children, ed. J Bybee, pp. 19–74. San Diego: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; Shame is often used synonymously with guilt, but implies a more passive and dejected response to a perceived wrong. Guilt and shame are considered "self-conscious" emotions, because they are of primary importance to an individual's self-evaluation. Moreover, there exists a bigger difference between guilt and shame that goes beyond the type of feelings that they may provoke within an individual. This difference lies in the fact that these two moral emotions do not weigh the same in terms of their impact on moral behaviors. Studies on the effects of guilt and shame on moral behaviors has shown that guilt has a larger ability to dissuade an individual from making immoral choices whereas shame did not seem to have any deterring effect on immoral behaviors. However, it should be noted that different types of behaviors in different types of population, under different circumstances might not generate the same outcomes (Tangney, Stuewig, &amp; Mashek, 2007). In contrast to guilt and shame, empathy and sympathy are considered other-oriented moral emotions. Empathy is commonly defined as an affective response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which mirrors the other's affective state. Similarly, sympathy is defined as an emotional response produced by the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state which does not mirror the other's affect, but instead causes one to express concern or sorrow for the other (Eisenberg, 2000).

The relation between moral action and moral emotions has been extensively researched. Very young children have been found to express feelings of care, and empathy towards others, showing concerns for other's well being (Eisenberg, Spinard, &amp; Sadovsky, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., Spinard, T. L., &amp; Sadovsky, A. (2006). Empathy-related responding in children. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 517-549). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has consistently demonstrated that when empathy is induced in an individual, he or she is more likely to engage in subsequent prosocial behavior (Batson 1998;&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1998). Altruism and prosocial behavior. In The Handbook of Social Psychology, ed. DT Gilbert, ST Fiske, G Lindzey, 2:282–316. Boston: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenberg, 200 for review). Additionally, other research has examined emotions of shame and guilt in relation to children's empathic and prosocial behavior (Zahn-Waxler &amp; Robinson, 1995).

While emotions serve as information for children in their interpretations about moral consequences of acts, the role of emotions in children's moral judgments has only recently been investigated. Some approaches to studying emotions in moral judgments come from the perspective that emotions are automatic intuitions that define morality (Greene, 2001;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. (2001). An fMRI Investigation of Emotional Engagement in Moral Judgment. ''Science'', 293 (5537), 2105-2108. {{doi|10.1126/science.1062872}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haidt, 2001&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2001). The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to moral judgment. ''Psychological Review'', 108, 814-834.&lt;/ref&gt;). Other approaches place emphasis on the role of emotions as evaluative feedback that help children interpret acts and consequences (Turiel &amp; Killen, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, E., &amp; Killen, M. (2010). Taking emotions seriously: The role of emotions in moral development. In W. Arsenio &amp; E. Lemerise (Eds.), Emotions in aggression and moral development. (pp. 33-52). Washington, D.C.: APA.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown children attribute different emotional outcomes to actors involved in moral transgressions than those involved in conventional transgressions (Arsenio, 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Arsenio, W. F. (1988). Children's conceptions of the situational affective consequences of sociomoral events. ''Child Development'', 59, 1611-1622.&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenio &amp; Fleiss, 1996&lt;ref&gt;Arsenio, W. F., &amp; Fleiss, K. (1996). Typical and behaviourally disruptive children's understanding of the emotional consequences of socio-moral events. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 14, 173-186&lt;/ref&gt;). Emotions may help individuals prioritize among different information and possibilities and reduce information processing demands in order to narrow the scope of the reasoning process (Lemerise &amp; Arsenio, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Lemerise, E., &amp; Arsenio, W. (2000). An integrated model of emotion processes and cognition in social information processing. ''Child Development'', 71, 107-118.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Malti, Gummerum, Keller, &amp; Buchmann, (2009) found individual differences in how children attribute emotions to victims and victimizers.&lt;ref&gt;Malti, T., Gummerum, M., Keller, M., &amp; Buchmann, M. (2009). Children's moral motivation, sympathy, and prosocial behavior. ''Child Development'', 80, 442-460.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of interpersonal, intergroup, and cultural influences==
Children's interactions and experiences with caregivers and peers have been shown to influence their development of moral understanding and behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/early-childhood-moral-development/|title=Early Childhood Moral Development|website=www.mentalhelp.net|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;Researchers have addressed the influence of interpersonal interactions on children's moral development from two primary perspectives: Socialization/Internalization (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994;&lt;ref&gt;Grusec, J. E., &amp; Goodnow, J. J. (1994). Impact of parental discipline methods on the child's internalization of values: A reconceptualization of current points of view.

''Child Development'', 66, 236-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Kochanska, Askan, &amp; Koenig, 1995&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G., Aksan, N., &amp; Koenig, A. L. (1995). A longitudinal study of the roots of preschoolers' conscience: Committed compliance and emerging internalization. ''Child Development'', 66, 1752-176&lt;/ref&gt;) and social domain theory.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"&gt;Turiel, E. (1983). The development of social knowledge: Morality and convention.

Moral development and moral education: An overview.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research from the social domain theory perspective focuses on how children actively distinguish moral from conventional behavior based in part on the responses of parents, teachers, and peers.&lt;ref&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1997). Parenting and the development of social knowledge reconceptualized: A social domain analysis. In J. E. Grusec &amp; L. Kuczynski (Eds.), Parenting and the internalization of values (pp. 162-192). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Social domain suggests that there are different areas of reasoning co-existing in development those include societal (concerns about conventions and grouping), moral (fairness, justice and rights) and psychological (concerns with personal goals and identity).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Turiel|first=E|date=2007|chapter=The Development of Morality |editors=W. Damon, R. M. Lerner and N. Eisenberg|url=|title=Handbook of Child Psychology|volume=3|edition=6th|doi=10.1002/9780470147658.chpsy0313 |isbn=9780471272878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults tend to respond to children's moral transgressions (e.g. hitting or stealing) by drawing the child's attention to the effect of his or her action on others, and doing so consistently across various contexts. In contrast, adults are more likely to respond to children's conventional misdeeds (e.g. wearing a hat in the classroom, eating spaghetti with fingers) by reminding children about specific rules and doing so only in certain contexts (e.g. at school but not at home).&lt;ref name=Smetana1984&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1984). Toddlers' social interactions regarding moral and conventional transgressions. ''Child Development'', 55, 1767-1776.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smetana, J. G. (1985). Preschool children's conceptions of transgressions: Effects of varying moral and conventional domain-related attributes. ''Developmental Psychology'', 21, 18-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Peers respond mainly to moral but not conventional transgressions and demonstrate emotional distress (e.g. crying or yelling) when they are the victim of moral but unconventional transgressions.&lt;ref name=Smetana1984/&gt; 

Research from a socialization/internalization perspective focuses on the ways in which adults pass down standards or rules of behavior to children through parenting techniques and why children do or do not internalize those values (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994; Kochanska &amp; Askan, 1995). From this perspective, moral development involves children's increasing compliance with and internalization of adult rules, requests, and standards of behavior. Using these definitions, researchers find that parenting behaviors vary in the extent to which they encourage children's internalization of values, and that these effects depend partially on a child attributes, such as age and [[temperament]] (Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994). For instance, Kochanska (1997) showed that gentle parental discipline best promotes conscience development in temperamentally fearful children but that parental responsiveness and a mutually responsive parent-child orientation best promote conscience development in temperamentally fearless children.&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G. (1997). Multiple pathways to conscience for children with different temperaments: From toddlerhood to age 5. ''Developmental Psychology'', 33, 228-240.&lt;/ref&gt; These parental influences exert their effects through multiple pathways, including increasing children's experience of moral emotions (e.g. guilt, empathy) and their self-identification as moral individuals (Kochanska, 2010&lt;ref&gt;Kochanska, G., Koenig, J. L., Barry, R. A., Kim, S., &amp; Yoon, J. E. (2010). Children's conscience during toddler and preschool years, moral self, and a competent, adaptive developmental trajectory. ''Developmental Psychology'', 46, 1320-1332&lt;/ref&gt;). Development can be divided up to multiple stages however the first few years of development is usually seen to be formed by 5 years of age. According to Freud's research, relationships between a child and parents early on usually provides the basis forth personality development as well as the formation of morality. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Freud|first=S|date=1930-1961|title=Civilization and its Discontents|url=|location=New York, NY|volume=|pages=|publisher=W. W. Norton.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers interested in intergroup attitudes and behavior related to ones moral development have approached the study of [[stereotypes]], [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] in children and adolescents from several theoretical perspectives. Some, however not limited to are of these theoretical frameworks: Cognitive Development Theory (Aboud, 1988);&lt;ref&gt;Aboud, F. E. (1988). Children and prejudice. Oxford, England: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Social Domain Theory (Killen &amp; Rutland, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Rutland, A. (2011). Children and social exclusion: Morality, prejudice, and group identity. NY: Wiley/Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen, Sinno, &amp; Margie, 2007&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Sinno, S., &amp; Margie, N. G. (2007). Children's experiences and judgments about group exclusion and inclusion. In R. V. Kail (Ed.), Advances in child development and behavior (pp. 173-218).

A new social-cognitive developmental perspective on prejudice: The interplay between morality and group identity. ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', 5, 280-291.&lt;/ref&gt;); Implicit Theories (Levy, Chiu, &amp; Hong, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S. R., Chiu, C. Y., &amp; Hong, Y. Y. (2006). Lay theories and intergroup relations. Group Processes and Intergroup Relations., 9, 5-24&lt;/ref&gt; and Intergroup-contact Theory (Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, T. F., &amp; Tropp, L. R. (2008). How does intergroup contact reduce prejudice? Meta-analytic tests of three mediators. ''European Journal of Social Psychology'', 38, 922-934. {{doi|10.1002/ejsp.504}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plethora of research approaches is not surprising given the multitude of variables, (e.g. group identity, group status, group threat, group [[Norm (social)|norms]], [[Contact hypothesis|intergroup contact]], individual beliefs and context) that need to be considered when assessing children's intergroup attitudes. While most of this research has investigated two-dimensional relationships between each of the three components: stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination (e.g., role of stereotypes in intergroup prejudice, use of stereotypes to reason about intergroup discrimination, how prejudices manifest into discrimination), very few have addressed all three aspects of intergroup attitudes and behaviors together (McKown, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;McKown, C. (2004). Age and ethnic variation in children's thinking about the nature of racism. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 25, 597-617. {{doi|10.1016/j.appdev.2004.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developmental intergroup research, stereotypes are defined as judgments made about an individual's attributes based on group membership (Killen, Margie, &amp; Sinno, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Margie, N. G., &amp; Sinno, S. (2006). Morality in the context of intergroup relationships. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 155-183). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Killen et al., 2007). These judgments are more complex than regular judgments as they require one to recognize and understand (eg. gender, race, religion, culture, nationality, ethnicity) which group one individual belongs to as they might be treated differently delliberately because of the group they are associated with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social psychologists focus on stereotypes as a cognitive component influencing intergroup behaviors and tend to define them as being fixed concepts associated with a category (Allport, 1954).&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). The nature of prejudice. Reading, MA: Addison Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; Prejudice, on the other hand is defined in terms of negative attitudes or affective expressions toward a whole group or members of a group (Stangor, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Stangor, C. (2009). The study of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination within social psychology: A quick history of theory and research. In T. D. Nelson (Ed.), Handbook of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. (pp. 1-22). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative stereotypes and prejudices can manifest into discrimination towards an outgroup and for children and adolescents, this may come in the form of exclusion from peer groups as well as the wider community (Killen &amp; Rutland, 2011). Such actions can negatively impact a child in the long term in the sense of weakening ones confidence, self esteem as well personal identity. 

One explicit manner in which societies can socialize individuals is through moral education. Solomon and colleagues (1988) present evidence from a study that integrated both direct instruction and guided reflection approaches to moral development, with evidence for resultant increases in spontaneous prosocial behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, D., Watson, M. S., Delucchi, K. L., Schaps, E., &amp; Battistich, V. (1988). Enhancing children's prosocial behavior in the classroom. American Educational Research Journal, 25, 527-554.&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture can also be a key contributor toward differences in morality within society.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David R.|title=Social and personality development|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|page=357|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosocial behavior, which is behavior that benefits others, is much more likely in societies with strong social goals rather than societies which emphasize the individual. For example, children being raised in China eventually adopt the collective communist ideals of their society. In fact, children learn to lie and deny responsibility for accomplishing something good instead of seeking recognition for their actions.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development" /&gt; Early indications of prosocial behavior include the sharing of toys and comforting distressed friends, and these characteristics can be seen in an individual’s behavior as young as infancy and toddlerhood.  Starting in preschool, sharing, helping, and other prosocial behaviors become more common, particularly in females, although the gender differences in prosocial behavior are not evident in all social contexts.&lt;ref name="Social and personality development"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David R.|title=Social and personality development|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|page=357|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral relativism ===
[[Moral relativism]], also called “cultural relativism,” suggests that morality is relative to each culture. One cannot rightly pass moral judgement on members of other cultures except by their own cultural standards when actions violate a moral principle, which may differ from one’s own. [[Richard Shweder|Shweder]], Mahapatra, and Miller (1987) argued for the notion that different cultures defined the boundaries of morality differently.&lt;ref&gt;Shweder, R. A., Mahapatra, M., &amp; Miller, J. G. (1987). Culture and moral development In J. Kagan &amp; S. Lamb (Eds.), The emergence of morality in young children. (pp.1-83). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also different from [[moral subjectivism]] which refers to the view that moral truth is relative to the individual. Moral relativism can be identified as a form of [[moral skepticism]] and is often misidentified as [[moral pluralism]]. It opposes to the attitude of moral superiority and ethnocentrism found in [[moral absolutism]] and the views of [[moral universalism]]. Turiel and Perkins (2004) argued for the universality of morality, focusing largely on evidence throughout history of resistance movements that fight for justice through the affirmation of individual self-determination rights.&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, E. &amp; Perkins, S. A. (2004). Flexibilities of mind: Conflict and culture. Human Development, 47, 158-178.&lt;/ref&gt;Miller (2006) proposes that there is cultural variability in the priority given to moral considerations (e.g., the importance of prosocial helping).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. G. (2006). Insights into moral development from cultural psychology. In M. Killen &amp; J. G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of moral development (pp. 375-398). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than variability in what individuals consider moral (fairness, justice, rights). Wainryb (2006), in contrast, demonstrates that children in diverse cultures such as the U.S., India, China, Turkey, and Brazil share a pervasive view about upholding fairness and the wrongfulness of inflicting armong others.&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (2006). Moral development in culture: Diversity, tolerance, and justice. In M. Killen &amp; J.G. Smetana (Eds.), Handbook of Moral Development (pp. 211-242). NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultures vary in terms of conventions and customs, but not principles of fairness, which appear to emerge very early in development, prior to socialization influences. Wainryb (1991; 1993) shows that many apparent cultural differences in moral judgments are actually due to different informational assumptions, or beliefs about the way the world works.&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (1991). Understanding differences in moral judgments: The role of informational assumptions. ''Child Development'', 62, 840-851.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wainryb, C. (1993). The application of moral judgments to other cultures: Relativism and universality. ''Child Development'', 64, 924-933.&lt;/ref&gt;  When people hold different beliefs about the effects of actions or the status of different groups of people, their judgments about the harmfulness or fairness of behaviors often differ, even when they are applying the same moral principles. 

=== Religion ===
The role of religion in a culture may influence a child's moral development and sense of moral identity. Values are transmitted through [[religion]], which is for many inextricably linked to a cultural identity. [[Religious development]] often goes along with moral development of the children as it shapes the child's concepts of right and wrong. Intrinsic aspects of religion may have a positive impact on the internalization and the symbolism of moral identity. The child may internalize the parents' morals if a religion is a family activity or the religious social group's morals to which the child belongs. Religious development mirrors the cognitive and moral developmental stages of the children. Nucci and Turiel (1993), on the other hand, proposed that the development of morality is distinct from the understanding of religious rules when assessing individuals' reactions to whether moral and nonmoral religious rules was contingent to God's word and whether a harmful act could be justified as morally right based on God's commands.&lt;ref&gt;Nucci, L. P., &amp; Turiel, E. (1993). God's word, religious rules and their relation to Christian and Jewish children's concepts of morality. ''Child Development'', 64, 1485-1491.&lt;/ref&gt; Children form their own understanding of how they see the world, themselves or others and are able to understand that not all religious rules are applied to morality, social structures or different religions. 

===In indigenous American communities===

In [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American communities]], morality is taught to children through [[storytelling]]. It provides children guidelines for understanding the core values of their community, the significance of life and ideologies of moral character from past generations. &lt;ref name="Howard 1999 45–53"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=Scott J.|title=Contemporary American Indian storytelling: An outsider's perspective|journal=American Indian Quarterly|date=1999|volume=23|pages=45–53|doi=10.2307/1185925|jstor=1185925}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Storytelling]] shapes the minds of young children in these communities as well as forms the dominant means for understanding and the basic foundation for learning and teaching.  

[[Storytelling]] in everyday life is used as an [[Informal learning|indirect form of teaching]]. Stories embedded with lessons of morals, ideals, and ethics are told alongside daily household chores. Most children in Indigenous American communities develop a sense of keen [[attention]] to the details of a story with the goal of learning from them, and to understand why people do the things they do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaskins|first=Suzanne|title=Open Attention as a Cultural Tool for Observational Learning|url=http://kellogg.nd.edu/learning/Gaskins.pdf|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding gained from a child's observation of morality and ethics taught through storytelling allows them to participate within their community appropriately.

Specific animals are used as characters to symbolize specific values and views of the culture in the [[storytelling]] where listeners are taught through the actions of these characters. In the [[Lakota tribe]], coyotes are often viewed as a trickster character, demonstrating negative behaviors like greed, recklessness, and arrogance &lt;ref name="Howard 1999 45–53"/&gt; while bears and foxes are usually viewed as wise, noble, and morally upright characters from which children learn to model .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/legends.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the stories, trickster characters often get into troubles, thus teaching children to avoid exhibiting similar negative behaviors. The reuse of characters calls for a more predictable outcome that children can more easily understand.

===Social exclusion===

Intergroup exclusion context provides an appropriate platform to investigate the interplay of these three dimensions of intergroup attitudes and behaviors, prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination. Developmental scientists working from a Social Domain Theory (SDT: Killen et al., 2006; Smetana, 2006) perspective have focused on methods that measure children's reasoning about exclusion scenarios. This approach has been helpful in distinguishing which concerns children attend to when presented with a situation in which exclusion occurs. Exclusion from a peer group could raise concerns about moral issues (e.g. fairness and empathy towards excluded), social-conventional issues (e.g., traditions and social norms set by institutions and groups) and personal issues (e.g., autonomy, individual preferences related to friendships), and these can coexist depending on the context in which the exclusion occurs. In intergroup as well as intragroup contexts, children need to draw on knowledge and attitudes related to their own social identities, other social categories, the social norms associated with these categories as well as moral principals about the welfare of the excluded, and fair treatment, to make judgments about social exclusion. The importance of morality arises when the evaluation process of social exclusion requires one to deal with not only the predisposed tendencies of discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes and bias but also the internal judgments about justice equality and individual rights, which may prove to be a very complex task since it often evokes conflicts and dilemmas coming from the fact that the components of the first often challenge the components of the latter (Killen, Lee-Kim, McGlothlin, &amp; Stangor, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killen|first=Melanie|last2=Lee-Kim|first2=Jennie|last3=McGlothlin|first3=Heidi|last4=Stangor|first4=Charles|last5=Helwig|first5=Charles C.|date=2002|title=How Children and Adolescents Evaluate Gender and Racial Exclusion|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=67|issue=4|pages=i–129|jstor=3181568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings from a Social Domain Theory perspective show that children are sensitive to the context of exclusion and pay attention to different variables when judging or evaluating exclusion. These variables include, social categories, the stereotypes associated with them, children's qualifications as defined by prior experience with an activity, personality and behavioral traits that might be disruptive for group functioning and conformity to conventions as defined by group identity or social consensus. In the absence of information, stereotypes can be used to justify exclusion of a member of an out-group (Horn 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Horn, S. S. (2003). Adolescents' reasoning about exclusion from social groups. ''Developmental Psychology'', 39, 71-84&lt;/ref&gt; Killen and Stangor, 2001&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Stangor, C. (2001). Children's social reasoning about inclusion and exclusion in gender and race peer group contexts. ''Child Development'', 72, 174-186&lt;/ref&gt;). One's personality traits and whether he or she conforms to socially accepted behaviors related to identity also provide further criteria for social acceptance and inclusion by peers (Killen, Crystal, &amp; Watanabe, 2002;&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., Crystal, D. S., &amp; Watanabe, H. (2002). The individual and the group: Japanese and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion, tolerance of difference, and prescriptions for conformity. ''Child Development'', 73, 1788-1802&lt;/ref&gt; Park, Killen, Crystal, &amp; Watanabe, 2003&lt;ref&gt;Park, Y., Killen, M., Crystal, D., &amp; Watanabe, H. (2003). Korean, Japanese, and American children's evaluations of peer exclusion: Evidence for diversity. International Journal of Behavioral Development, 27, 555-565&lt;/ref&gt;). Also, research has documented the presence of a transition occurring at the reasoning level behind the criteria of inclusion and exclusion from childhood to adolescence (Horn, 2003). As children get older, they become more attuned to issues of group functioning and conventions and weigh them in congruence with issues of fairness and morality (Killen &amp; Stangor, 2001)

===Allocation of resources===

[[Resource allocation]] is a critical part of the [[decision making process]] for individuals in positions of public responsibility and authority (e.g., health care providers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=71–4|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmid=8083876|pmc=1376429}}&lt;/ref&gt; When resources become scarce, such as in rural communities experiencing situations when there is not enough food to feed everyone, authorities in position to make decisions that affect this community can create conflicts on various levels (e.g., personally, financially, socially, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.,|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.,|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moral conflict that arise from these decisions can be divided into a focus of conflict and a locus of moral conflict. The locus, or the place where conflict occurs, can develop from multiple sources which include “any combination of personal, professional, organizational, and community values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardent|first1=Paul B.,|last2=Reeves|first2=Susan A.,|title=Ethic Conflicts in Rural Communities|url=http://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/cfm/resources/ethics/chapter-09.pdf|publisher=Dartmouth College Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of conflict occurs from competing values held by stakeholders and financial investors. As K. C. Calman (1994) stated in regards to the reallocation of resources in a medical setting, resources must be thought of not only as money, but also in the form of skills, time, and faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calman|first1=K C|title=The ethics of allocation of scarce health care resources: a view from the centre.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1 June 1994|volume=20|issue=2|pages=72–73|doi=10.1136/jme.20.2.71|pmc=1376429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, in the United States, has had a moral consensus that there are no differences between these two therapies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47927">{{Political campaigning}}
In the [[politics of the United States]], '''opposition research''' (also called '''oppo research''') is the practice of collecting information on a political opponent or other adversary that can be used to discredit or otherwise weaken them. The information can include biographical, legal, criminal, medical, educational, or financial history or activities, as well as prior media coverage, or the voting record of a politician. Opposition research can also entail using "trackers" to follow an individual and record their activities or political speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-05-22/opposition-research-romney-obama/55138756/1 |title=Researchers dig deeper for dirt on political opposition |last=Schouten |first=Fredreka |date=23 May 2012 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research is usually conducted in the time period between announcement of intent to run and the actual election; however political parties maintain long-term databases that can cover several decades. The practice is both a tactical maneuver and a cost-saving measure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephanie |last=Mencimer |title=Dirty Politics |publisher=[[Center for Public Integrity]] |date=30 May 2008 |url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2008/05/30/3104/dirty-politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is frequently used to refer not just to the collection of information but also how it is utilized, as a component of [[negative campaigning]].

==Origins and history==
In the 1st century BC, [[Cicero]] is said to have gathered information that was damaging to opponents and using it in attacks against them. He accused one political opponent, [[Catiline]], of murdering one wife to make room for another. He attacked [[Mark Antony]] in speeches known as the ''[[Philippicae]]'', eventually prompting Antony to chop off his head and right hand and display them at the Roman Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kamber |first=Victor |author-link=Victor Kamber |title=Poison Politics |location=New York |publisher=Insight Books |year=1997 |page=9 |isbn=978-030645628-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition research also has its origins in military planning, as evident in such ancient texts as ''[[The Art of War]]'', published in the 5th century BC by [[Sun Tzu]]. This manual for warriors describes the necessity for understanding an opponent's weaknesses, for using spies, and for striking in moments of weakness.

In 18th century England, opposition research took the form of scandalmongering pamphlet wars between the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] parties. Writers such as [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Jonathan Swift]], and [[Henry Fielding]] participated, often writing under assumed names.&lt;ref&gt;Kamber, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition of robust attack was replicated later in the American colonies, when writers such as [[Thomas Paine]] or [[Benjamin Franklin]] conducted opposition research and published their results.

The first appearance of the phrase "opposition research" in the ''New York Times'' occurred on December 17, 1971, in an article that describes the infiltration of the [[Edmund Muskie]] presidential campaign by a female Republican volunteer:  "...an article appeared in a Washington newspaper describing the 'opposition research' program at Republican headquarters..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  |first=James M. |last=Naughton
  |title=A Republican Spy in Muskie's Ranks Is Unmasked and Sent Out into the Cold
  |newspaper=New York Times
  |date=December 17, 1971
  |page=26
  |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.htmlres=FA0D10F83C5E127A93CBA81789D95F458785F9
  |accessdate=2012-02-03}}  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition research became systematized in the 1970s when [[Ken Khachigian]], in the [[Nixon Administration]] suggested that the GOP keep files on individuals as insurance against future races, rather than "scramble" in an ''ad hoc'' fashion race by race.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Methods==

Opposition research differs immensely depending on the size and funding of a campaign, the ethics of the candidate, and the era in which it is conducted. Information gathering can be classified into three main categories: open-source research enabled by the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], [[covert operations]] or "[[tradecraft]], " and maintenance of human systems of informants. Increasingly, data-mining of electronic records is used. Information is then stored for future use, and disseminated in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John J. |last=Pitney |title=The Art of Political Warfare |location=Norman OK |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=2000 |pages=120–139 |isbn=978-080613263-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local election sometimes has a [[political campaign staff|staff member]] dedicated to reading through all of the opponents' public statements and their voting records; others initiate whisper campaigns that employ techniques of [[disinformation]] or "black ops" to deliberately mislead the public by advancing a pre-determined "narrative" that will present the opponent in a negative light.

Another technique is to infiltrate the opposition's operations and position a paid informant there. "Gray propaganda" techniques are often used to release damaging information to news media outlets without its source being identified properly, a technique inherited from disinformation tactics employed by intelligence agencies such as the [[Office of Strategic Services]] during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Pitney, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

File-sharing between operatives of political parties is quite common.  In the 2008 presidential election, a dossier of opposition research against Republican Vice-Presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]] was posted in its entirety on a political blog site, [[Politico.com]]. The file was compiled by the staff of her opponent in the 2006 Alaska gubernatorial race, [[Tony Knowles (politician)|Tony Knowles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Ben |last1=Smith |first2=John |last2=Bresnehan |title=Documents Detail Palin's Political Life |website=Politico |date=2 September 2008 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2008/09/documents-detail-palins-political-life-013084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Oppo dumps" are used by political campaigns to systematically supply files of damaging information to press outlets, including matters of the public record, video footage from party archives and private collections, as well as private intelligence gathered by operatives. Many prime time television and radio news commentaries rely on this supply of party-generated material because it is free, and therefore more cost-effective than paying investigative reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Megan |last=McArdle |title=Prime Time for Oppo Dumps |magazine=[[Atlantic Monthly]] |date=31 March 2008 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2008/03/prime-time-for-oppo-dumps/3157/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Scherer |title=The Matt Drudge Primary |website=Salon.com |date=14 May 2007 |url=https://www.salon.com/2007/05/14/drudge_11/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates and incumbents who benefit from opposition research often choose to remain uninformed about their campaign's operations and tactics, to insure [[plausible deniability]] should criminal charges be brought against researchers.

==="Trackers" and videography===
Yet another technique is to position information or personnel within media outlets. Often the information is video footage gathered in campaign-funded "tracker programs" wherein videographers use candidates' itineraries to track them and record as many remarks as possible, since anything they say can and will be used against them, as was the case in former Senator George Allen's "macaca moment."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In  the 2006 election cycle, a Virginia senator, [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]], was unseated because of videotape of the senator calling a videographer/opposition researcher as "macaca" or monkey. The name was considered to be an ethnic slur, and Allen's campaign could not overcome the damage when the incident was broadcast widely in mainstream media and on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jack |last=Bass |title=In Dixie, Signs of a Rising Biracial Politics |publisher=New York Times |date=May 11, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/weekinreview/11bass.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital media and Wikipedia ===
A 2005 analysis of digital media strategies published by the American Academy of Political Science took the view that new technologies enable "political elites" to use database and Internet technologies to do opposition research more easily, but they use data-mining techniques that outrage privacy advocates and surreptitious technologies that few Internet users understand. Data becomes "richer" about political actors, policy options, and the diversity of actors and opinion in the public sphere, but citizenship is "thinner" by virtue of "the ease in which people can become politically expressive without being substantively engaged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Howard |first=Philip N. |author-link=Philip N. Howard |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |year=2005 |volume=597 |pages=153–170 |doi=10.1177/0002716204270139 |title=Deep Democracy, Thin Citizenship: The Impact of Digital Media in Political Campaign Strategy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Facebook]] photos became a tool of opposition researchers in [[California's 32nd congressional district special election, 2009]] to replace [[Hilda Solis]].  Front-runner [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Gil Cedillo]] sent out mailers targeting 26-year-old Emanuel Pleitez, grouping Pleitez's Facebook photos to suggest that he parties to excess with alcohol, and fraternizes with [[gangs]].  The text of the mailer suggested Pleitez, posing with a Latino stage actress and using a Latino [[voter registration drive]] hand sign, was "flashing gang signs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Aaron |last=Blake |title=Facebook Photos Used as Opposition Research |website=The Hill |date=May 7, 2009 |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/campaigns/35943-facebook-photos-used-as-opposition-research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the campaign manager of Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate [[Cathy Cox]], Morton Brilliant, resigned after Cox's opponent, Lt. Gov, [[Mark Taylor (American politician)|Mark Taylor]], revealed Cox's campaign had added information from an opposition research dossier to a Wikipedia page on Taylor. Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] confirmed that the material had come from an IP address affiliated with the Cox campaign. Citing an Associated Press analysis, CNN reported that Wikipedia being used as a "popular tool" for opposition researchers became so widespread a problem that Wikipedia altered its submission guidelines and set up alerts so that its operators know when [[Capitol Hill]] staffers alter Wikipedia content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Hamby |title=Campaign Manager Resigns Amid Wikipedia Flap |work=CNN Politics |date=April 26, 2006 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/26/cox.wikipedia/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, anyone who wanted to could simply bypass this by using an IP address not associated with Capitol Hill.

===Grassroots oppo-research===
Opposition research is a necessary component of "grassroots" activist groups. Research on corporate or political opponents may enable activist groups to target neighborhoods from which to increase their numbers, to refine their focus or "target," to pinpoint the target's vulnerabilities, to reveal hidden sources of funding or little-known connections, to investigate scare tactics, and to augment a legislative initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lee |last=Staples |title=Roots to Power:  A Manual for Grassroots Organizing |edition=2nd |location=Westbury, CT |publisher=Praeger |date=2003 |page=227, passim |isbn=978-027596997-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the presidential election of 2008, the blog [[Talking Points Memo]] pioneered "collaborative citizen-reporting projects" based on groups of volunteers examining public documents that shed light on the George W. Bush administration's U.S. attorneys firings controversy.  Other organizations such as the [[Sunlight Foundation]] encouraged citizen examination of such public domain records as Mitt Romney's financial disclosure statements and Bill Clinton's income statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Arnoldy |title=Army of Average Joes Culls Through Candidates' Files, Bios |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=October 17, 2007 |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1017/p03s03-uspo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventative measures===
Political strategies for campaigns often include coaching on preventive measures to avoid providing too much information in public disclosure procedures that can provide ammunition for opponents' opposition researchers, particularly in itemized expenditure reports. "To eliminate some of these potential issues your campaign should take the time to review the wording of your campaign finance reports," advises one strategist writing for ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Instead of reporting that you spent $3,000 on a 'background check and public records search on Congressman X,' list the expenditure as 'issue research' or simply 'research'... One bonus financial filing tip:  warn your candidate about spending campaign funds on fancy restaurants for 'strategy meetings.' Eating at [[Ruth's Chris Steak House|Ruth's Chris]] or [[Morton's The Steakhouse|Morton's Steak House]] on your campaign's dime just looks bad.  The press may poke a little fun at your candidate's expense; your donors may feel their donation in being misspent and may never give again.&lt;ref&gt;Brent Barksdale, quoted in [http://www.politicsmagazine.com/blog_post/show/425 "TMI Can Sink Your Report,"] Campaigns &amp; Elections/Politics blog, ''The Hill'', July 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Funding and institutions===
Congressional and presidential opposition research is often conducted by or funded by a political party, lobbying group, [[political action committee]] (PAC), or a [[527 group]] that coalesces around a certain issue. In the U.S., both the Republican and Democratic parties employ full-time "Directors of Research" and maintain databases on opponents. In recent years the task of opposition research has been privatized in many areas. Full-time companies with permanent staff specializing in media productions or "grassroots" operations have replaced volunteers and campaign officials. Political media consultants may also opt for [[astroturfing]] techniques, which simulate wide popular appeal for a candidate's platform.

== In presidential elections ==
Opponents of [[Andrew Jackson]] in the 1824 and 1828 presidential elections unearthed his marriage records to imply that he was an [[adultery|adulterer]] for marrying Rachel Robards before she was legally divorced from her first husband.  Jackson had married her in 1791 on the strength of a statement from her husband that he had divorced her; Jackson had two wedding ceremonies, the not-recognizable one of 1791 and the legally corrective one of 1794.  His political opponents used this information decades later against him, and he fought many duels over his wife's honor.  Rachel Robards died before Jackson took office in his first term; he maintained that the stress of the opposition had killed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The life of Andrew Jackson |last=Remini|first=Robert Vincent |year=2001 |publisher=Perennial |isbn=0060937351 |edition=1st Perennial classics |location=New York |oclc=46951836 |pages=17–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], the law partner of [[Abraham Lincoln]], did research in the Illinois State Library to collect "all the ammunition Mr. Lincoln saw fit to gather" to prepare for the run against [[Stephen A. Douglas]] in the 1860 presidential race.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Harold Holzer, ed.  The Lincoln-Douglas Debates, New York: HarperCollins, 1994, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for Ronald Reagan’s debate with President [[Jimmy Carter]] in the presidential race 1980, Reagan’s campaign staff acquired under mysterious circumstances a 200-page briefing book, including information on Carter’s strategy, which staffers [[David Stockman]] and [[David Gergen]] had used to prepare Reagan.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department investigated to see how the information had been obtained by the Reagan camp. Two law professors filed suit in federal district court in Washington to request a special investigation, based on the 1978 [[Ethics in Government Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, “Special Prosecutor Sought in Briefing Book Case,”  October 26, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter’s staff believed the book to have been stolen from the White House, but the inquiry did not uncover any credible evidence that any law had been violated. The House of Representatives conducted its own investigation, and concluded in a 2,314-page report that the Reagan staff had two copies of the book, one from Reagan’s campaign director [[William J. Casey]], future head of the Central Intelligence Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Rottinghaus |first1=Brandon |last2=Bereznikova |first2=Zlata |date=September 2006 |title=Exorcising Scandal in the White House: Presidential Polling in Times of Crisis |journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=493–505 |doi=10.1111/j.1741-5705.2006.02559.x |issn=0360-4918}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Baker]] attributed the acquisition of the documents to Casey, who claimed to know nothing about them, and an analysis of Carter campaign documents found in the “Afghanistan” files of Reagan aide [[David Gergen]] indicated they came from three White House offices: the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] and Domestic Adviser [[Stuart Eizenstat]].&lt;ref&gt;Ed Magnuson, “I Never Knew There Was Such a Thing,” Time, July 11, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Many years afterward, Carter himself stated in a PBS interview that the book had been taken by columnist [[George Will]], but Will denied it, calling Carter "a recidivist liar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=George |last=Will |title=Briefing Book Baloney |work=Washington Post |date=August 11, 2005 |page=A23 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001796.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lee Atwater]] is considered to be the "father" of modern aggressive "oppo" techniques.  Atwater honed his style working in his native South Carolina for Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] and to elect Congressman (later Governor) [[Carroll Campbell]].  From his posts on the 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]], Atwater encouraged and helped direct what was then the advanced oppo work of the [[Republican National Committee]] against Democrats [[Walter Mondale]] and [[Michael Dukakis]]. During the 1988 presidential campaign, dozens of RNC researchers worked three shifts around the clock to feed the then-burgeoning [[24-hour news cycle]].  The now-infamous “Willie Horton” TV ads crafted by [[Floyd Brown]] helped turn voters away from Dukakis and towards the Republican, although Atwater and Bush were protected by [[plausible deniability]] because Brown's ads were independently funded and produced.  Academic research into the Bush archives decades later revealed that a Bush staffer, Candice Strother, had released a dossier of information on Willie Horton to Elizabeth Fediay, of the non-profit group that contracted for the ad.&lt;ref&gt;Tali Mendelburg, ''The Race Card'', Princeton University Press, 2004, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Horton story had been completely public for an entire year, part of news coverage that won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for the Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune newspaper.) [[Willie Horton]] was an African-American convicted murderer released on a weekend furlough during Governor Dukakis’s tenure, who escaped and committed a brutal rape in Maryland, also stabbing his victim's husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Beloved Mug Shot For the Bush Forces |work=New York Times |date=October 3, 1988 |page=A22 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/03/us/campaign-trail-a-beloved-mug-shot-for-the-bush-forces.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atwater is also credited with originating "push polls" and "whisper campaigns" that use disinformation strategies to alienate voters from opponents.  A biography of Atwater, quotes him as saying in an interview toward the end of his life that he regretted some of his less ethical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Joseph |last=Brady |title=Bad Boy: The Life and Politics of Lee Atwater |year=1997 |isbn=0201627337}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992 presidential campaign, Republicans reported that they spent $6 million on a "state of the art (opposition research) war machine" to investigate Bill Clinton, who was running against [[George H. W. Bush]].  In the same election, the Clinton campaign paid more than $100,000 to a private investigator to look into allegations about Clinton's womanizing, investigating more than two dozen women.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Johnson, ''No Place for Amateurs'', 2nd edition. New York: Routlege, Taylor, and Francis Group, 2007, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000 presidential election, longtime opposition researcher and Nixon loyalist [[Roger Stone]] was recruited by former Secretary of State [[James Baker]] to oversee the recount of the disputed Presidential election in Miami-Dade County in 2000. Stone is credited with organizing the street demonstrations and eventual shut-down of the recount in that pivotal county.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Toobin, ''Too Close to Call'',&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004 presidential race, [[Chris Lehane]], a Democratic opposition researcher attracted notoriety and built a reputation not for deploying his skills against Republican opponents, but for using them against other Democrats in the primary races.  Working for retired Army general Wesley Clark, Lehane sought to establish a media "narrative" that Howard Dean was hypocritical and dishonest, based on surveys of his administrative archive as governor of Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Joshua |last=Green |title=Playing Dirty |work=The Atlantic Monthly |date=June 2004 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/06/playing-dirty/302960/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A protege of Atwater's, [[Karl Rove]], is considered to be the "architect" of George W. Bush's election to the governor's office in Texas, and to the presidency in 2000 and 2004. In the 2000 race, Rove is credited with masterminding the push poll that initiated the "[[John McCain]] has a black love child" whisper campaign in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Dirty Tricks, South Carolina and John McCain |magazine=The Nation |date=January 14, 2008 |last=Banks |first=Ann |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/dirty-tricks-south-carolina-and-john-mccain/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anonymous telephone pollsters, upon determining that a voter was pro-McCain, asked the question, "Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain if you knew he had fathered a black child out of wedlock?" The question was not overt slander, but it prompted the president of [[Bob Jones University]] to launch his own internet campaign against McCain, and succeeded in crippling the trust of voters McCain had attracted. The Bush camp knew, as the general public did not, that in reality, John McCain was the adoptive father of a dark-skinned Bangladeshi refugee who was rescued by his wife Cindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard H. |last=Davis |title=The Anatomy of a Smear Campaign |work=Boston Globe |date=March 21, 2004 |url=https://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 presidential election, opposition researchers for Barack Obama unearthed the fact that John Edwards had paid $400 for haircuts at campaign expense, and supplied Politico's Ben Smith with the tip, according to a memoir later published by campaign manager David Plouffe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Smith |title=A Haircut Tip |work=Politico |date=November 10, 2009 |url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2009/11/a-haircut-tip-022732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Democratic National Committee]] continues to fund a research department, after the 2008 presidential election, the New York Times reported that "The legacy of the Democratic National Committee itself is hardly clear going forward.

==Executive branch==
* '''Franklin Roosevelt Administration''': In 1940, the White House accidentally taped a conversation of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] instructing a lower level aide to disseminate a rumor about his opponent [[Wendell Willkie]] having an extramarital affair: "We can't have any of our principal speakers refer to it, but the people down the line can get it out."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Roosevelt, quoted in John J. Pitney, ''The Art of Political Warfare'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Johnson Administration''': In 1964, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] sent 30 FBI agents to the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, N.J., to avert assassination attempts, and to monitor his political rival [[Robert Kennedy]] and civil rights activists. Johnson later also placed his Republican challenger, [[Barry Goldwater]], under FBI surveillance, with a federal wiretap.&lt;ref&gt;Pitney, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nixon Administration''': During the [[Richard Nixon]] administration, White House staffers compiled lists of names of political opponents, journalists who had criticized Nixon, and artists and actors (such as [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Paul Newman]]) who had dissented with Nixon policy, especially on the subject of Vietnam, with the intent of prompting Internal Revenue Service investigations. The full extent of Nixon's surveillance of private citizens solely on the basis of their dissent was not known until years after Nixon was forced to resign, as former staff members such as [[Charles Colson]] and [[John Dean]] began to disclose details.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  [[Nixon's Enemies List]] is the informal name of what started as a list of President Richard Nixon’s major political opponents compiled by Charles Colson, written by George T. Bell [1] (assistant to Colson, special counsel to the White House) and sent in memorandum form to John Dean on September 9, 1971. The list was part of a campaign officially known as “Opponents List” and “Political Enemies Project.” The official purpose, as described by the White House Counsel’s Office, was to “screw” Nixon’s political enemies, by means of tax audits from the IRS, and by manipulating “grant availability, federal contracts, litigation, prosecution, etc.”&lt;ref&gt;"List of White House 'Enemies' and Memo Submitted by Dean to the Ervin Committee," ''Facts on File, Watergate and the White House'', vol. 1, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ford Administration''': During the [[Gerald Ford]] presidency, Deputy Assistant [[Dick Cheney]] suggested in a now-infamous memo to [[Donald Rumsfeld]] that the White House use the [[United States Justice Department]] to conduct opposition research and retaliate against political opponents and critical journalists such as [[Seymour Hersh]] and the [[New York Times]], arguing that the executive branch had the power to prosecute journalists as they saw fit, under the provisions of the [[Espionage Act of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newswar/preview/documents.html Dick Cheney's Memos from 30 Years Ago] – Frontline.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reagan Administration''': In 1984, during the [[Ronald Reagan]] presidency, the [[Republican National Committee]] formed [[The Opposition Research Group]], with its own budget of $1.1 million. These staff amassed information on eight Democratic presidential candidates based on data from voting records, Congressional Record speeches, media clippings and transcripts, campaign materials, all of which was stored on a computer for easy access. In this way the Reagan team was able to track inconsistencies and attack them. This original data base evolved into a network that linked information gleaned by Republicans in all 50 states, creating a master data base accessible to high-ranking Republican staff, even aboard [[Air Force One]].&lt;ref&gt;J.M Bayer &amp; J. Rodota, "Computerized Opposition Research," ''Campaigns &amp; Elections'', 6, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this RNC database was accessible to both the Reagan White House and campaign team, no evidence has surfaced that U.S. federal dollars funded [[The Opposition Research Group]] or its efforts.
* '''Clinton Administration''': During the [[Bill Clinton]] administration, the "[[White House FBI files controversy|Filegate]]" scandal erupted when White House staffers said to be acting on the directions of First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] improperly accessed 500 FBI files compiled for security checks of Reagan and Bush staffers in previous administrations. Craig Livingstone, said to be hired by Mrs. Clinton with dubious credentials, resigned amid public outcry. In testimony under oath during the [[Kenneth Starr]] special prosecutor's investigation, Mrs. Clinton stated that she had neither hired Livingstone nor improperly perused the files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=George Lardner Jr. |author2=Susan Schmidt |title=Livingstone Resigns, Denying Ill Intent |work=Washington Post |date=June 27, 1996 |page=A01 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/stories/wwtr960627.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''George W. Bush Administration''': Two former opposition researchers for the RNC appointed to Justice Department posts, [[Timothy Griffin]] and [[Monica Goodling]], were implicated in efforts to use data collected on Democratic-appointed federal attorneys as ground for dismissal. See [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy]]. See also [[Karl Rove]].  Also during this administration,  [[Counterintelligence Field Activity]] (CIFA), an intelligence gathering arm of [[the Pentagon]] was disbanded in 2008, after investigations into the bribery activities directed at [[Duke Cunningham]] revealed that the U.S. government kept a sizeable database of information about 126 domestic peace activist groups, including [[Quakers]], about 1,500 "suspicious incidents" including peace demonstrations outside armed forces recruiter offices, even though the groups posed no specified threat to national security.  The program was known as Talon. About two years elapsed between the program's disbanding and the ''Post'' report. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' quoted an unnamed "official" as saying,"On the surface, it looks like things in the database that were determined not to be viable threats were never deleted but should have been," the official said. "You can also make the argument that these things should never have been put in the database in the first place until they were confirmed as threats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Walter |last=Pincus |title=Pentagon Will Review Database on U.S. Citizens |work=Washington Post |date=December 15, 2001 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/14/AR2005121402528.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Barack Obama Administration:'''  In February 2009, Shauna Daly, a former opposition researcher for the Democratic National Committee was appointed as a researcher for the White House's Office of Legal Counsel. Daly was [[Barack Obama]]'s deputy research director during the presidential campaign, spent much of the cycle rebutting viral online attacks on Obama's character and biography under the rubric of "Stop the Smears." Shortly thereafter, amid speculations that she would be conducting research against political opponents,  she was reassigned as Research Director to the DNC.  Politico.com reported on February 27, 2009 that "the counsel's office – which doesn't face the sort of rapid-response demands that were common in the late Clinton years – doesn't plan to fill the research post."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Smith, ''Politico.com'', February 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The American Spectator]]'' reported on its "Washington Prowler" blog that Daly was posted in the White House Counsel's Office for "about a month," and thus had access to "reams of Bush administration documents related to such things as the firings of U.S. Attorney, the use and internal debate over the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] and the [[Scooter Libby]] and [[Karl Rove]] investigations.  The "Prowler" quoted  "a DNC staffer" as saying, "She realized that she could do more with all the material she saw outside of the building than inside where she'd be bound by the rules and legalities of the White House Counsel's Office.  Now she isn't.  She's good at what she does; her time at the White House means we've got a mother load (''sic'') of material that will have Republicans scrambling.  At least that's what we hope."&lt;ref&gt;"The Washington Prowler," [[The American Spectator]], March 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court==

In 1916, after President [[Woodrow Wilson]] nominated [[Louis Brandeis]] for the Supreme Court, "concerned" citizens seeking to block his confirmation offered information that Brandeis was a "radical Zionist," even though he was not a practicing Jew. Brandeis aggressively outmaneuvered his detractors by mounting his own opposition research efforts, including a carefully constructed chart that exposed the social and financial connections of the group, mostly from Boston's Back Bay, and including Harvard president [[Lawrence Lowell]], as well as a group headed by former President [[William Howard Taft]] and a host of [[American Bar Association]] past presidents. Brandeis sent the chart to [[Walter Lippman]] at the ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' who penned an editorial condemning "the most homogeneous, self-centered, and self-complacent community in the United States."  Brandeis was confirmed after four months of hearings, in a Senate vote of 47–22.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boudin|first=Michael|date=1976|editor-last=Urofsky|editor-first=Melvin I.|editor2-last=Levy|editor2-first=David W.|editor3-last=Brandeis|editor3-first=Louis D.|title=Justice Brandeis: The Confirmation Struggle and the Zionist Movement|jstor=795344|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=85|issue=4|pages=591–596|doi=10.2307/795344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Reagan]] nominated Judge [[Robert Bork]] for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987, prompting a Senate floor speech from Democratic Massachusetts senator [[Ted Kennedy]], which later became known as the "Robert Bork's America" speech:
::&lt;small&gt;Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is – and is often the only – protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy.&lt;/small&gt;

Kennedy's speech prompted a rapid-response opposition research effort from Democrats, but the White House waited two and a half months to respond. The [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], under the direction of Delaware senator and presidential hopeful [[Joseph Biden]], commissioned a report in response to the materials Reagan's staff had released in support of Bork's nomination. Prepared by a panel of lawyers, including two Duke University law professors, the 78-page became known as "The Biden Report." The report detailed Bork's record, and analyzed the pattern of his rulings, and deeming him to be a conservative "activist" rather than an impartial jurist  Ultimately, Bork's embattled nomination failed, and Anthony Kennedy (no relation to Ted) was later confirmed to fill the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report Assails Bork's Record On Constitutional Questions |agency=AP |work=New York Times |date=September 4, 1987 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/us/report-assails-bork-s-record-on-constitutional-questions.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Christopher H. |last1=Schroeder |first2=Jeffrey |last2=Peck |title=Response Prepared to White House Analysis of Judge Bork’s Record (Biden Report) |date=September 2, 1987 |journal=Cardozo Law Review |volume=9 |pages=219–296 |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fierce research-based opposition to Bork's nomination attracted significant media attention, even though a [[Gallup Poll]] on the eve of the confirmation vote showed that very few Americans could name the nominee in question, much less recall his rulings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gallup Poll'' (2007), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; A new verb was later coined; "to bork" a candidate or nominee by mounting such voluminous research and vocal opposition that the person in question would be forced to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire]] (2001, May 27).

After President [[George W. Bush]] nominated [[Harriet Miers]] to the U.S. Supreme Court, the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reported that Republican conservative advocacy groups were conducting opposition research against her: "Groups are circulating lists of questions they want members of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] to ask Miers at her confirmation hearings. The activists' thinly veiled hope is that Miers will reveal ignorance of the law and give senators a reason to oppose her."&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Savage, "Guess Who's Doing Opposition Research Against Harriet Miers?" ''Boston Globe'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Miers later withdrew her name from consideration for the court.

On July 7, 2005, soon after the resignation of Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], the [[Democratic National Committee]] gathered and circulated information on the "anti-civil rights" and "anti-immigrant" rulings of [[Samuel A. Alito, Jr.]], by then nominated by President [[George W. Bush]] to replace her. Upon inspection, the documents were revealed to have been amended by [[Devorah Adler]], research director for the DNC. Alito's "record" had been pointedly altered to present him in a negative light. While the incident was not unusual, it received publicity in prominent places because it drew attention to the "meta-data" that is often unwittingly stored in documents that are altered and forwarded electronically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Zeller, Jr.]], "Beware Your Trail of Digital Fingerprints," ''New York Times'', November 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2009, after Supreme Court Justice [[David Souter]] announced his intent to retire from the court, the ''New York Times'' reported that Curt Levey, executive director of the Committee for Justice, had noted that conservatives were "focusing opposition research efforts on 17 women, whom they have divided into two tiers based on their perceived chances."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlie Savage]], "Wider World of Choices to Fill Souter's Vacancy," ''New York Times'', May 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven aides to members of the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] pleaded guilty on January 7, 2010, to illegal use of state resources for campaign activities, including opposition research against the political opponents of incumbent officeholders during 2007.

During [[Lamar Alexander]]'s 2002 campaign for the U.S. Senate, Alexander's campaign staff received an anonymous mailing of a photograph of opponent [[Bob Clement]] obviously serving as a board member of a failed bank whose owners had been imprisoned for bank fraud.  When the Alexander campaign raised the issue of Clement's financial ties with the convicted felons, Clement denied any connection.

In early July 2009 Alaska governor Sarah Palin announced that she would be resigning as governor, partly due to complications from opposition research and ethics inquiries after her inclusion on the 2008 GOP presidential race ballot as John McCain's running mate. At a later news conference Palin told reporters, "Obviously conditions had changed so drastically on August 29, the day I was tapped to be VP," she said. "The opposition research and the games that began there — which I think is the new normal in Alaska politics, until I hand the reins over to Sean Parnell — have been so distracting."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pennsylvania state legislature in July 2009, former state House Democratic Campaign Committee Chair, Rep. [[Stephen Stetler]] found himself amidst an investigation when he rejected a plan that would have shifted the job of opposition research from employees on the state payroll to private firms.  Attorney General [[Tom Corbett]] alleged that millions in public funds were paid to state employees who did such research on the 2006 and 2004 campaigns of Democrats in the state.  Stetler left the House after 2006 to become the state's revenue secretary. A former aide, Dan Wiedemer testified before grand jurors that the suggestion to remove politically motivated research from the hands of public employees "was more or less shot down."  Though Stetler has not been charged, 12 former House members and members of their staff were charged with diverting public funds for political campaign work.&lt;ref&gt;Tracie Mauriello and [[Dennis B.

In January 2017, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) was exposed when [[Sihle Bolani]] filed an affidavit in the [[Gauteng Division|Johannesburg High Court]], demanding payment for her part in project War Room. The War Room's mandate was to “disempower [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|DA]] and [[Economic Freedom Fighters|EFF]] campaigns” and set a pro-ANC agenda using a range of media, without revealing the [[African National Congress|ANC’s]] hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amabhungane.co.za/article/2017-01-24-inside-the-ancs-black-ops-election-campaign|title=Inside the ANC’s "black ops" election campaign|website=amabhungane.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass media ethics==

The practice of using tips from opposition research sources was examined in 1994 by [[Howard Kurtz]], media analyst for ''The Washington Post''. Kurtz surveyed the major networks, ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and other influential media outlets, and found varying levels of use of oppo research information on [[David Hale (Whitewater)|David Hale]] as a witness in the [[Whitewater controversy]]. At this time, Brown confirmed that he had been the source of four mainstream media stories that had received attention from the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' because they bore striking resemblance to the opposition research being disseminated by Citizens United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Kurtz |title=Muckrakers and the Mudslinger: Should Media Treat Floyd Brown Seriously? |work=The Washington Post |date=April 19, 1994 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-886599.html |url-access=subscription |via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2007, [[Roger Stone]], a political consultant in the employ of New York state senator [[Joseph Bruno]], was forced to resign after leaving threatening phone messages on the answering machine of the 85-year-old father of New York Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]], alleging that Spitzer's campaign finances were conducted improperly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |title=Political Consultant Resigns After Allegations of Threatening Spitzer's Father |date=April 23, 2007 |page=1 |last1=Hakim |first1=Danny |last2=Confessore |first2=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/23/nyregion/23stone.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November of that same year, Stone sent a letter to the FBI detailing Spitzer's sexual preferences with prostitutes and sexual props, right down to his black calf-length socks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Murray |last=Weiss |title='Two on One' vs. Spitzer |work=New York Post |date=April 24, 2008 |page=1 |url=https://nypost.com/2008/04/24/two-on-one-vs-spitzer/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone was considered to be an authoritative source because he frequented the same prostitutes as a client himself. A subsequent Justice Department investigation produced evidence that ultimately led to Spitzer's resignation as governor. [[Joseph Bruno]], Stone's client, has been a longtime political enemy of Eliot Spitzer.

==In popular culture==
The television show ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' depicts many examples of opposition research, particularly the character of Doug Stamper, the loyal adviser to [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Francis "Frank" Underwood]], who regularly engages in the practice with little morality and few ethics.

'''Opto 22''' is a manufacturing company specializing in hardware and software products for [[industrial automation]], remote monitoring, and [[data acquisition]]. The company is based in Southern California and sells [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] [[relays]] and [[Ethernet]]-based [[input/output]] systems and controllers. It is based in [[Temecula, California]].

== History ==

Opto 22 was founded in 1974 as a manufacturer of [[solid state relays]]. The company soon expanded its offerings to include a variety of computer-based industrial automation, remote monitoring, and data acquisition products. In 1978, Opto 22 developed the first computer-based plug-in [[I/O]] modules, and created the Yellow-Black-White-Red color scheme used to identify digital AC input, digital AC output, digital DC input, and digital DC output modules respectively.

In 1982, the company created Optomux, a serial-based I/O system using the [[ASCII]] protocol. The following year, with the introduction of the [[personal computer]] prompting a shift in the automation industry to PC-based control, Opto 22 developed what was to be the first in a series of software packages for designing control strategies on a PC using [[flowcharts]]. This provided a new alternative to the more popular [[ladder logic]] programming model. Later, Opto 22 introduced the ''mistic'' controller, which had many of the same features and functionality of a modern [[programmable logic controller]].

Opto 22 markets the SNAP brand of [[Ethernet]] products, including industrial processors, controllers, I/O racks and modules, software and accessories. In 2007 the company introduced the SNAP PAC System, adding higher powered controllers with redundant Ethernet communications, new programming and [[human machine interface]] development software, higher density I/O modules, [[database]] connectivity tools and software that simulated the SNAP PAC controller hardware. The result was a suite of control system components, suitable for simple cell control or complex, distributed control architectures.

[[File:Spencerian example.jpg|thumb|Example of classic American business cursive handwriting known as [[Spencerian script]] from 1884.]]

'''Penmanship''' is the technique of [[writing]] with the hand using a [[writing instrument]].  Today, this is most commonly done with a [[pen]], or [[pencil]], but throughout history has included many different [[writing implement|implements]].  The various generic and formal historical styles of writing are called "[[Hand (handwriting)|hands]]" while an individual's style of penmanship is referred to as "[[handwriting]]".

==History==

===Origins===
{{Details|History of writing}}

The earliest example of systematic writing is the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] pictographic system found on clay tablets, which eventually developed around 3200 BC into a modified version called [[cuneiform]]&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe. (2003) ''Pen, Ink &amp; Evidence: A Study of Writing and Writing Materials for the Penman, Collector, and Document Detective''. New Castle: Oak Knoll Press. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; which was impressed on wet clay with a sharpened reed.&lt;ref&gt;Tschichold, Jan. (1948) ''An Illustrated History of Writing and Lettering''. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of writing eventually evolved into an ideographic system (where a sign represents an idea) and then to a syllabic system (where a sign represents a syllable).&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, Alfred J. (1977). ''A Book of Scripts''. London: Faber. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing around the same time, the Egyptian system of [[hieroglyphics]] also began as a pictographic script and evolved into a system of syllabic writing.  Two cursive scripts were eventually created, [[hieratic]], shortly after hieroglyphs were invented, and [[demotic (Egyptian)]] in the seventh century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe (2003). ''Pen, Ink &amp; Evidence: A Study of Writing and Writing Materials for the Penman, Collector, and Document Detective''. New Castle: Oak Knoll Press. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Scribes wrote these scripts usually on [[papyrus]], with ink on a reed pen.

The first known alphabetical system came from the [[Phoenicians]], who developed a vowel-less system of 22 letters around the eleventh century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Andrew (2007). ''The Story of Writing''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks eventually adapted the Phoenician alphabet around the eighth century BC.  Adding vowels to the alphabet, dropping some consonants and altering the order, the [[Ancient Greeks]] developed a script which included only what we know of as capital Greek letters.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, B. L. (1977). ''Ancient Writing and Its Influence''. Buffalo: University of Toronto Press. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The lowercase letters of [[Classical Greek]] were a later invention of the [[Middle Ages]].  The Phoenician alphabet also influenced the [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]] scripts, which follow a vowel-less system.  One Hebrew script was only used for religious literature and by a small community of Samaritans up until the sixth century BC.  Aramaic was the official script of the Babylonian, Assyrian and Persian empires and ‘Square Hebrew’ (the script now used in Israel) developed from Aramaic around the third century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Andrew (2007). ''The Story of Writing''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Handwriting based on Latin script ===
{{Details|Palaeography}}

The Romans in Southern Italy eventually adopted the Greek alphabet as modified by the [[Etruscans]] to develop Latin writing.&lt;ref name="Fairbank, Alfred J. 1977 pg 10"&gt;Fairbank, Alfred J. (1977). ''A Book of Scripts''. London: Faber. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the Greeks, the Romans employed stone, metal, clay, and papyrus as writing surfaces.  Handwriting styles which were used to produce manuscripts included square capitals, [[rustic capitals]], uncials, and half-uncials.&lt;ref name="Nickell, Joe 2003 pg 118"&gt;Nickell, Joe (2003). ''Pen, Ink &amp; Evidence: A Study of Writing and Writing Materials for the Penman, Collector, and Document Detective''. New Castle: Oak Knoll Press. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Square capitals were employed for more-formal texts based on stone inscriptional letters, while rustic capitals freer, compressed, and efficient.&lt;ref name="Fairbank, Alfred J. 1977 pg 10"/&gt;   [[Uncials]] were rounded capitals ([[majuscules]]) that originally were developed by the Greeks in the third century BC, but became popular in Latin manuscripts by the fourth century AD.  Roman cursive or informal handwriting started out as a derivative of the capital letters, though the tendency to write quickly and efficiently made the letters less precise.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, 1977, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Half-uncials (minuscules) were lowercase letters, which eventually became the national hand of Ireland.&lt;ref name="Nickell, Joe 2003 pg 118"/&gt; Other combinations of half-uncial and cursive handwriting developed throughout Europe, including Visigothic, and Merovingian.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, 1977, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the eighth century, [[Charlemagne]] decreed that all writings in his empire were to be written in a standard handwriting, which came to be known as [[Carolingian minuscule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Handwriting |url= http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=1592&amp;HistoryID=ab33&amp;gtrack=pthc |agency=Historyworld.net |date=2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alcuin of York]] was commissioned by Charlemagne to create this new handwriting, which he did in collaboration with other scribes and based on the tradition of other Roman handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, 2003, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carolingian minuscule was used to produce many of the manuscripts from monasteries until the eleventh century and most lower-case letters of today's European scripts derive from it.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, 1977, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gothic or black-letter script, evolved from Carolingian, became the dominant handwriting from the twelfth century until the Italian Renaissance (1400–1600 AD).  This script was not as clear as the Carolingian, but instead was narrower, darker, and denser.  Because of this, the dot above the ''i'' was added in order to differentiate it from the similar pen strokes of the ''n'', ''m'', and ''u''.  Also, the letter ''u'' was created as separate from the ''v'', which had previously been used for both sounds.&lt;ref name="vletter.com"&gt;http://www.vletter.com/handwriting.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of the reason for such compact handwriting was to save space, since [[parchment]] was expensive.&lt;ref name="handwrite.net"&gt;{{cite book |author= Mary B. Woods, Michael Woods |title=Ancient Machine Technology: From Wheels to Forges |url=
https://books.google.com/books?id=a3hLQ6Ypo-AC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78 |pages=78 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gothic script, being the writing style of scribes in Germany when [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]] invented movable type, became the model for the first type face.  Another variation of Carolingian minuscule was created by the Italian humanists in the fifteenth century, called by them ''littera antiqua'' and now called [[humanist minuscule]].&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, 2003, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a combination of Roman capitals and the rounded version of Carolingian minuscule.  A cursive form eventually developed, and it became increasingly slanted due to the quickness with which it could be written.  This manuscript handwriting, called [[cursive humanistic]], became known as the typeface [[Italic type|Italic]] used throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, B. L. (1977). ''Ancient Writing and Its Influence''. Buffalo: University of Toronto Press. p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[intaglio printing|Copperplate engraving]] influenced handwriting as it allowed penmanship copybooks to be more widely printed.  Copybooks first appeared in Italy around the sixteenth century; the earliest writing manuals were published by [[Sigismondo Fanti]] and Ludovico degli Arrighi.&lt;ref name="Nickell, Joe 2003 pg 131"&gt;Nickell, 2003, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other manuals were produced by Dutch and French writing masters later in the century, including Pierre Hamon.&lt;ref name="Nickell, Joe 2003 pg 131"/&gt;  However, copybooks only became commonplace in England with the invention of copperplate engraving.  Engraving could better produce the flourishes in handwritten script, which helped penmanship masters to produce beautiful examples for students.&lt;ref name="vletter.com"/&gt;  Some of these early penmanship manuals included those of [[Edward Cocker]], [[John Seddon (calligrapher)|John Seddon]], and John Ayer.  By the eighteenth century, schools were established to teach penmanship techniques from master penmen, especially in England and the United States.&lt;ref name="handwrite.net"/&gt;  Penmanship became part of the curriculum in American schools by the early 1900s, rather than just reserved for specialty schools teaching adults penmanship as a professional skill.  Several different penmanship methods have been developed and published, including Spencerian,  Getty-Dubay, Barchowsky Fluent Handwriting, Icelandic (Italic), Zaner-Bloser, and D’Nealian methods among others used in American education.&lt;ref name="handwrite.net"/&gt;

[[File:Semi-cursive style Calligraphy of Chinese poem by Mo Ruzhong.jpg|thumbnail|Example of semi-cursive style Chinese calligraphy]]

=== Handwriting based on Chinese script ===

Writing systems developed in East Asia include [[Chinese character|Chinese]] and [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] writing systems. Chinese characters represent whole morphemes rather than individual sounds, and consequently are visually far more complex than European scripts; in some cases their pictographic origins are still visible. The earliest form of Chinese was written on bones and shells (called [[Jiaguwen]]) in the fourteenth century BC.  Other writing surfaces used during this time included bronze, stone, jade, pottery, and clay, which became more popular after the twelfth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin]]. (1969). ''Written on Bamboo and Silk''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;  Greater Seal script ([[Dazhuan]]) flourished during 1100 BC and 700 BC and appeared mainly in bronze vessels.&lt;ref name="ancientscripts.com"&gt;http://www.ancientscripts.com/chinese.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lesser Seal script ([[Xiaozhuan]]) is the precursor of modern complex Chinese script, which is more stylized than the Greater Seal.&lt;ref name="ancientscripts.com"/&gt;

Chinese handwriting is considered an art, more so than illuminated manuscripts in Western culture.  [[Calligraphy]] is widely practiced in China, which employs scripts such as [[Kaishu]] (standard), [[Xingshu]] (semi-cursive), and [[Caoshu]] (cursive).&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Andrew. (2007) ''The Story of Writing''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese calligraphy is meant to represent the artistic personality in a way western calligraphy cannot, and therefore penmanship is valued higher than in any other nation.&lt;ref&gt;Tschichold, Jan. (1948) ''An Illustrated History of Writing and Lettering''. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Standard Script ([[Kaishu]]) is main traditional script used today.

Japanese writing evolved from Chinese script and Chinese characters, called [[kanji]], or ideograms, were adopted to represent Japanese words and grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Andrew. (2007) ''The Story of Writing''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kanji were simplified to create two other scripts, called [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]].  Hiragana is the more widely used script in Japan today, while katakana, meant for formal documents originally, is used similarly to italics in alphabetic scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Andrew. (2007) ''The Story of Writing''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching methods and history ==

=== Books used in North America ===
[[File:Handwriting.png|thumbnail|'[[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]]', written by two different hands]]

[[Platt Rogers Spencer]] is known as the "Father of American Penmanship". His writing system was first published in 1848, in his book ''Spencer and Rice's System of Business and Ladies' Penmanship''. The most popular Spencerian manual was ''The Spencerian Key to Practical Penmanship'', published by his sons in 1866. This "[[Spencerian Script|Spencerian Method]]" Ornamental Style was taught in American schools until the mid-1920s, and has seen a resurgence in recent years through [[charter schools]] and [[home schooling]] using revised Spencerian books and methods produced by former [[IAMPETH]] president [[Michael Sull]] (born 1946).

George A. Gaskell (1845–1886), a student of Spencer, authored two popular books on penmanship, ''Gaskell's Complete Compendium of Elegant Writing'' and ''The Penman's Hand-Book'' (1883).  [[L. H. Hausam|Louis Henry Hausam]] published the "New Education in Penmanship" in 1908, called "the greatest work of the kind ever published."&lt;ref name="Hausam"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/h3/hausam_l_h.html|volume=Volume III|issue=Part 2|title=Kansas: a cyclopedia of state history, embracing events, institutions, industries, counties, cities, towns, prominent persons, etc.|publisher=Standard Pub. Co.|location=[[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]|year=1912|accessdate=March 10, 2013|quote=L. H.

Many copybooks were produced in North America at the start of the 20th century, mostly for Business Style penmanship (a simplified form of Ornamental Style).  These included those produced by [[Austin Norman Palmer|A. N. Palmer]], a student of Gaskell, who developed the [[Palmer Method]], as reflected in his ''Palmer's Guide to Business Writing'', published in 1894.  Also popular was Zaner-Bloser Script, introduced by [[Charles Paxton Zaner]] (15 February 1864&amp;nbsp;– 1 December 1918) and Elmer Ward Bloser (6 November 1865&amp;nbsp;– 1929) of the Zanerian [[Business College]]. The A. N. Palmer Company folded in the early 1980s.

Modern Styles include more than 200 published textbook curricula including: [[D'Nealian|D'Nealian Script]] (a derivative of the Palmer Method which uses a slanted, serifed manuscript form followed by an entirely joined and looped cursive), Modern Zaner-Bloser which accounts for the majority of handwriting textbook sales in the USA, A Beka, Schaffer, Peterson, Loops and Groups, McDougal, Steck Vaughn, and many others.

Italic Styles include Getty-Dubay (slightly slanted), Eager, Portland, Barchowsky, Queensland, etc.

Other copybook styles that are unique and do not fall into any previous categories are Smithhand, Handwriting without Tears, Ausgangsschrift, Bob Jones, etc. these may differ greatly from each other in a variety of ways.
The first made video for correcting messy handwriting especially for people with ADHD and or dysgraphia was " Anyone Can Improve Their Own Handwriting" by learning specialist Jason Mark Alster MS.c.

=== Schools in East Asia ===
[[File:KanjiPractice.jpg|thumbnail|A typical Kanji practice notebook of a 3rd grader]]

By the nineteenth century, attention was increasingly given to developing quality penmanship in Eastern schools.  Countries which had a writing system based on logographs and syllabaries placed particular emphasis on form and quality when learning.&lt;ref name="Gray, William S. 1961 pg 189"&gt;Gray, William S. (1961) “The Teaching of Reading and Writing”. Chicago: Scott, Foresman, and Company. p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  These countries, such as China and Japan, have pictophonetic characters which are difficult to learn.  Chinese children start by learning the most fundamental characters first and building to the more esoteric ones.  Often, children trace the different strokes in the air along with the teacher and eventually start to write them on paper.&lt;ref name="Gray, William S. 1961 pg 189"/&gt;

In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, there have been more efforts to simplify these systems and standardize handwriting.  For example, in China in 1955, in order to respond to illiteracy among people, the government introduced a Romanized version of Chinese script, called Pinyin.&lt;ref name="Robinson, Andrew 2007 pg 196"&gt;Robinson, Andrew. (2007) The Story of Writing. London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;   However, by the 1960s, people rebelled against the infringement upon traditional Chinese by foreign influences.&lt;ref name="Robinson, Andrew 2007 pg 196"/&gt;   This writing reform did not help illiteracy among peasants.  Japanese also has simplified the Chinese characters it uses into scripts called kana.  However kanji are still used in preference over kana in many contexts, and a large part of children's schooling is learning kanji.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Andrew. (2007) The Story of Writing. London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Japan has tried to hold on to handwriting as an art form while not compromising the more modern emphasis on speed and efficiency.  In the early 1940s, handwriting was taught twice, once as calligraphy in the art section of school curricula, and then again as a functional skill in the language section.&lt;ref name="Adal, Raja 2009 pg 244"&gt;Adal, Raja. (2009). "Japan's Bifurcated Modernity: Writing and Calligraphy in Japanese Public Schools 1872-1943." ''Theory Culture Society.'' 26:233-248. p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  The practical function of penmanship in Japan did not start to be questioned until the end of the twentieth century; while typewriters proved more efficient than penmanship in the modern West, these technologies had a hard time transferring to Japan, since the thousands of characters involved in the language made typing unfeasible.&lt;ref name="Adal, Raja 2009 pg 244"/&gt;

== Motor control ==

Handwriting requires the [[motor coordination]] of multiple joints in the [[hand]], [[wrist]], [[elbow]], and [[shoulder]] to form letters and to arrange them on the page. Holding the pen and guiding  it across paper depends mostly upon sensory information from skin, joints and muscles of the hand and this adjusts  movement to changes in the friction between pen and paper.&lt;ref&gt;Lacquaniti F. (1989). Central representations of human limb movement as revealed by studies of drawing and handwriting. Trends Neurosci. 12(8):287-91. {{DOI|10.1016/0166-2236(89)90008-8}} {{PMID|2475946}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With practice and familiarity, handwriting becomes highly automated using motor programs stored in [[motor memory]].&lt;ref&gt;van der Plaats RE, van Galen GP. (1990).Effects of spatial and motor demands in handwriting. J Mot Behav. 22(3):361-85. {{PMID|15117665}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other complex motor skills handwriting is far less dependent on a moment-to-moment visual guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Marquardt C, Gentz W, Mai N. (1999). Visual control of automated handwriting movements. Exp Brain Res. 128(1-2):224-8. {{PMID|10473764}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hepp-Reymond"&gt;Hepp-Reymond MC, Chakarov V, Schulte-Mönting J, Huethe F, Kristeva R. (2009).  Role of proprioception and vision in handwriting. Brain Res Bull. 79(6):365-70. {{PMID|19463909}} {{doi|10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.05.013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in individuals with complete [[Neuropathy|peripheral deafferentation]] with and without vision of their writing hand finds increase of number of pen touches, increase in number of inversions in velocity, decrease of mean stroke frequency and longer writing movement duration. The changes show that [[cutaneous]] and [[proprioceptive]] feedback play a critical role in updating the motor memories and [[internal model (motor control)|internal models]] that underlie handwriting. In contrast, sight provides only a secondary role in adjusting  motor commands.&lt;ref name="Hepp-Reymond"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">The best-known '''pleorama''' was a 19th-century moving [[Panoramic painting|panorama]] entertainment where the viewers sat in a rocking boat while panoramic views on painted canvas rolled past. The word has sometimes been used for other entertainments or innovations.

Architect [[Carl Ferdinand Langhans]] introduced a pleorama in [[Breslau]] in 1831 with scenes of the [[Bay of Naples]] on both sides of 24 "voyagers" sitting in a wooden boat floating in a pool of water. The illusion was enhanced by light and sound effects: the boatman singing, [[Vesuvius]] erupting. Writer/artist [[August Kopisch]] was involved in designing the hour-long show.

Carl Wilhelm Gropius, who had a [[diorama]] exhibit in [[Berlin]], took over management of this pleorama in 1832, and there was also a pleorama of a journey along the river [[Rhine]]. 

The Swiss writer Bernard Comment, among others, has pointed out the similarities between Langhans' pleorama and the ambitious [[mareorama]] at the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exhibition]].

A similar idea was used for a [[London]] ''padorama'' in 1834. Spectators were seated in [[railway]] carriages to watch a moving panorama of scenes visible from the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

In 1850s [[Finland]] the name ''pleorama'' was given to shows which presented historic scenes and panoramic views using glass, but posters for these do not mention anything resembling Langhans' boat concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibbild.abo.fi/nojen/ Posters in Swedish for pleoramas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''pleorama'' was coined from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] elements. Like other 19th century novelties ending in ''-orama'' - [[diorama]] and [[cyclorama]], for instance - the second half of the word has the sense of 'something seen'. The ''pleo-'' part here is understood to come from a Greek word meaning 'float' which applies to Langhans' boat in water idea. ''Pleorama'' is also the 21st century name of an innovative "floating house".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25740">In [[linguistics]], a '''relativizer''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|rel}}''')  is a type of [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] that introduces a [[relative clause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Paul|title=Parts-of-speech systems|year=1985|pages=3–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in English, the conjunction ''that'' may be considered a relativizer in a sentence such as "I have one that you can use."&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;Fox, Barbara A. and Thompson, Sandra A. (2007) "Relative Clauses in English conversation: Relativizers, frequency, and the notion of construction", Studies in Language, 31 (2), p.&amp;nbsp;293-326(34).&lt;/ref&gt; Relativizers do not appear, at least overtly, in all languages; even in languages that do have overt or pronounced relativizers, they do not necessarily appear all of the time. For these reasons it has been suggested that in some cases, a "[[Zero (linguistics)|zero]] relativizer" may be present, meaning that a relativizer is implied in the grammar but is not actually realized in speech or writing.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt; For example, the word ''that'' can be omitted in the above English example, producing "I have one you can use", using (on this analysis) a zero relativizer.

==Analysis==

Since as far back as 1712, people have written about relativizers and what functions they have.  They have been classified as conjunctions in earlier times, and have later been referred to as clause markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Ralph|title=The Sentence and its Parts|year=1961|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago &amp; London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are known today as relativizers. Despite an agreement in nomenclature, there are multiple analyses which attempt to account for the grammatical function and distribution of relativizers.

===Promotional analysis===

The promotional analysis is a transformational analysis from 1973 depicting relative clauses in English, and how relative pronouns are introduced into the embedded clause.  This analysis assumes that there is no overt head noun in the [[deep structure]] of the [[main clause]].  In order to form a relative construction, the noun phrase from the embedded clause is promoted to the empty head of the noun phrase of the main clause.  From there, a corresponding relative pronoun leaves a trace in the space of the vacated noun phrase in the embedded clause.&lt;ref name="Ihalainen 1981 371–375"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ihalainen|first=Ossi|title=Promotion vs Matching: Two Competing Transformational Analyses of English Relative Clauses|journal=English Studies|year=1981|volume=62|issue=4|pages=371–375|doi=10.1080/00138388108598127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example:
[[File:Figure 1, Tree displaying Promotional Analysis.jpeg|thumb|center|250px|Figure 1:  Tree displaying Promotional Analysis]]

===Matching analysis===
The Matching Analysis is another type of transformational analysis from the 1970s, which was in competition with the Promotional Analysis at that time.  In this analysis the relative pronoun is introduced into the embedded clause by corresponding or matching to the head noun in the main clause.  This is done by taking the noun phrase from the embedded sentence in the deep structure that matches the head noun in the noun phrase of the main clause, and replacing it with a relative pronoun.  The relative pronoun thus co-references the head noun in the main clause.  Finally, the relative pronoun is moved to the clause-initial position.&lt;ref name="Ihalainen 1981 371–375"/&gt;  For example:
[[File:Matching Analysis.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Figure 2: Tree displaying Matching Analysis]]

===Ouhallian analysis===

There are two separate phrasal heads that relativizers can occupy. Cross-linguistically, relativizers may occupy either the head of a [[complementizer]] phrase (C-Type Relativizer) or the head of a determiner phrase (D-Type Relativizer).  C-Type Relativizers can introduce a relative clause as an argument of a noun phrase, or they can introduce a relative clause as an argument of a verb phrase. D-Type Relativizers may only introduce a relative clause as an argument of a noun phrase. English is a language which uses a C-Type Relativizer, that, as a part of its relativization strategy because "that" can introduce a relative clause as either the argument to a [[Noun Phrase]] or the argument to a Complementizer Phrase. The following examples from English shows the same morpheme being used in both syntactic contexts.&lt;ref name="Ouhalla"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ouhalla|first=Jamal|title=Semitic Relatives|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|year=2004|volume=35|issue=2|pages=288–300|doi=10.1162/002438904323019084}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{|{{center}}
| [[File:C-Type Relativizer Tree.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Figure 3: Tree displaying Relativizer as an argument to the Verb Phrase]]
| [[File:DtypeRelativizer.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Figure 4: Tree displaying Relativizer as an argument to the Noun Phrase]]
|}

Conversely, Arabic uses two phonologically distinct morphemes to account for these syntactic phenomena. In the same sentences in a D-Type language like Arabic, each example would employ the use of a different morpheme as shown in examples 1 &amp; 2.&lt;ref name=Ouhalla/&gt;

 1) ''paris '''lli''' bħibba
    ''Paris '''RM''' I.love.it'''''
    The Paris '''that''' I love

 2) ''xabbaret-na laila '''ʔenno''' l-mmaslin mʔadrabiin
    ''told-us laila '''that''' the-actors on.strike''
    Laila told us '''that''' the actors are on strike.''

==In modern English==

There are three types of relativizers used in English to introduce relative clauses: zero or null relativizers, ''wh''-relativizers, and the ''that''-relativizer.&lt;ref name="sag"&gt;Sag, Ivana A. 1997. “[https://www.academia.edu/download/31190371/10.1.1.51.7483.pdf English relative clause constructions]”. Journal of linguistics. 33 (2), p. 431-483. DOI: 10.1017/S002222679700652X&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative distribution of null and overt relativizers===

'''Relativizers''' have been analyzed to be optional in certain languages and are variably omitted in the English language.  Such relativizer omission, or use of the null or zero variant of relativizers, does not pattern uniformly in English and has been predicted to be conditioned and constrained by a number of linguistic and social factors.&lt;ref name=Levey&gt;Levey, Stephen and Hill, Carolyn. (2013). “Social and Linguistic Constraints on Relativizer Omission in Canadian English”, American Speech, 88 (1), p. 32-62.]&lt;/ref&gt;  These social factors and the potential influence of age, gender, and education have been minimally explored and seem to exhibit a lesser effect on relativizer omission.  [[Linguistics|Linguistic]] constraints, such as sentence structure and [[syntax|syntactic]] position of the relativizer, [[clause|main clause]] construction type, lexical specificity of the head NP, type of antecedent, and the adjacency, length, and grammatical subject of the [[relative clause]] have been implicated as having more significant influence on the patterning of relativizer omission in Canadian English.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  The omission of relativizers tends to occur more frequently in conversation than in formal writing.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;

====Distribution with subject and object relative clauses====
The syntactic position or function of the relativizer in the relative clause is a major determiner for the choice of relative marker.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  The null relativizer variant is more common in object than subject relative clauses.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;
 3) ''I have friends '''that''' are moving in together.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''  (subject)
 4) ''That's one thing '''that''' I actually admire very much in my father.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''  (direct object)
 5) ''Everyone's kinda used to the age group '''[Ø]''' they work with.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''  (object of preposition)

====Informational content of the main clause determines distribution====
There is a preference for null relativizers when a [[clause|main clause]] that is informationally light is directly ''adjacent'' to the [[relative clause]].&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  For example:
 6) ''It's just kinda something '''[Ø]''' I noticed recently.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 7) ''They get values and stuff like that from church '''that''' they might not get at home.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
In this example, the main clause 'it's just kinda something' provides little [[semantics|semantic]] information and it is adjacent to the relative clause 'I noticed recently'.  As such, it is thought that the main clause and the relative clause are processed together as a unitary processing chunk that is functioning like a single statement, which results in a null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;

====Distribution with empty head noun phrases====
Empty head [[noun phrase]]s, which are not lexically specific and which index generic groups or sets, have been correlated with the use of the null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  Examples of empty noun phrases include words like ''all'', ''way'', ''time'', etc.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;
 8) ''All '''[Ø]''' she wants to do is sleep.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 9) ''She held onto all those jewelry boxes '''that''' everybody made for her when we were kids.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''

Unique head [[noun phrase]]s, which include [[superlative]]s and [[noun]]s with the words ''only'' and ''first'', also take the null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  For example:
 10) ''That's the only place '''[Ø]''' you can go at night.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 11) ''That's the first compliment '''[Ø]''' I've got in a long time.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 12) ''That was the worst job '''[Ø]''' I ever had.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 13) ''You have a home here '''that''' you could rent.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''

====Length of the noun phrase determines distribution====
Longer head [[noun phrase]]s often co-occur with an overt relativizer, whereas shorter noun phrases are more likely to co-occur with a null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  For example:
 14) ''This pair of suede pants '''that''' I got.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 15) ''The weight '''[Ø]''' I should be at.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
In these examples, the first sentence contains a longer noun phrase ('This pair of suede pants') in comparison to the second sentence, which contains a very short noun phrase ('The weight').  Thus, it is observed that the sentence containing the longer noun phrase also contains the relativizer 'that', whereas the sentence with the shorter noun phrase has a null relativizer.

====Definiteness of the noun phrase determines distribution====
Null relativizers have been found to be correlated to the definiteness of the nominal antecedent.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  For example:
 16) ''I don't think you have the dedicated teacher '''that''' I had.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 17) ''And it was a guy '''[Ø]''' she worked with for a few years.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
The first sentence contains a definite noun phrase, whereas the second sentence contains an indefinite noun phrase which co-occurs with the null relativizer.

====Distribution with relative clause pronominal subjects====
When the grammatical subject of a relative clause is a pronoun, it is more likely that the relativizer will be omitted.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  When the subject of a relative clause is a full noun phrase, the overt relativizer will be retained.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  For example:
 18) ''I have two cats '''[Ø]''' I'd like to turn in to the Humane Society.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 19) ''Do you remember exactly the road '''[Ø]''' I'm talking about?&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 20) ''That was one of the things '''[Ø]''' he did when he was living elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 21) ''I always go to my girlfriends 'cause there's stuff '''that''' your parents just don't need to know.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''

===Distribution of overt English relativizers===
{{Main|English relative clauses}}
The overt relativizers of Modern English include the words '''“which”''', '''“what”''', '''“when”''', '''“where”''', '''“who”''', '''“whom”''' and '''“whose”''', and these can be referred to within linguistics as "''wh''-words". These are officially classified as [[relative pronouns]], but can be referred to as “''wh''-relativizers” in instances where their function is to introduce a [[relative clause]].
The other overt relativizer of Modern English is the word '''“that”''', which can be referred to as the “''that''-relativizer” where it introduces a relative clause. There is some debate as to whether to classify it as a relative pronoun - like the wh-words, a [[subordinating conjunction]], or a [[complementizer]].&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt; The distribution of the different types of English relativizers varies depending on several factors.

====Fused relative clauses====
Fused relative clauses, sometimes referred to as “free” relative clauses, are different from most other types of relative clauses in that there is no nominal antecedent to which the relative clause refers. In many cases, the relativizers of English are relative pronouns, meaning that they are in [[coreference]] with a noun that precedes them in the sentence. This nominal function is “fused” with the relative clause in free relatives, and this leaves the relativizer without an overt entity to which it can refer. For example:
 22) ''I wonder '''what''' inspired them&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 23) ''I wonder '''whose''' dog died&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
There is no noun preceding the relative clause in these cases, and that is why it is said that this noun’s function is “fused” with the relative clause.

====Grammatical function of the relativized nominal determines relativizer case form====
Where there are different [[grammatical case]] forms of a relativizer, the case form that surfaces will depend on the [[grammatical function]] of the noun that appears previously in the sentence to which the relative clause refers, known as the nominal antecedent. The only examples in Modern English of this phenomenon are the forms “who” and “whom”. “Who” surfaces when it refers to a noun that is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the main clause, and “whom” surfaces when it refers to a noun that is an [[object (grammar)|object]] of the main clause. However, speaker judgments vary as to whether it is grammatical for "who" to surface when it is referring to an object of the main clause. Since, depending on speaker judgments, either only "whom" or both "who and "whom" can grammatically introduce a relative clause referring to an object, there is an "m" in brackets on the end of the relativizer in example (21) below.
* Subject antecedent
 24) ''The person '''who''' visited Kim&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
* Object antecedent
 25) ''The chairman listened to the student '''who(m)''' the professor gave a low grade to&lt;ref&gt;Eckman, Fred R. and Bell, Lawrence and Nelson, Diane. "On the generalization of relative clause instruction in the acquisition of English as a second language", Applied Linguistics. (1988), 9 (1), p. 1-20. DOI: 10.1093/applin/9.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;''

====Animacy of the antecedent determines distribution====
Only certain relativizers can introduce clauses that refer to human antecedents, and similarly, only certain relativizers can introduce clauses that refer to non-human antecedents. “Who”, “whom”, and “whose” can only refer to human antecedents, “which”, and “what” can only refer to non-human antecedents. “That”, however, can refer to both human and non-human antecedents. To exemplify: 
* Human antecedent
 26) ''The Pat '''that''' I like is a genius&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 27) ''The Pat '''who''' I like is a genius&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 28) ''The only person '''that''' I like '''whose''' kids Dana is willing to put up with is Pat&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
* Non-human antecedent
 29) ''Every essay '''that''' she's written '''which''' I've read is on that pile&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 30) ''Every essay '''which''' she's written '''that''' I've read is on that pile&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''

====Restrictiveness of the relative clause determines distribution====
Restrictive relative clauses add extraneous information that is not vital for the listener or reader’s understanding of which aforementioned noun is being referenced; or in other words, which noun is the nominal antecedent. Both ''wh''-relativizers and the ''that''-relativizer can be used to introduce restrictive relative clauses. Nonrestrictive relative clauses have [[semantic]] properties which make them necessary to prevent the sentence from being ambiguous. They are used in cases where the context that surrounds the sentence is not sufficient for the distinction between the potential nominal antecedents. Commas mark nonrestrictive relative clauses, and only the ''wh''-relativizers can be used to introduce them. To exemplify:
* Restrictive sentences:
 31) ''He has four sons '''that''' became lawyers &lt;ref name="bache"&gt;Bache, Carl and Jakobsen, Leif K. (1980) "On the distribution between restrictive and nonrestrictive relative clauses in modern English", Lingua, 52 (2), p. 243-267&lt;/ref&gt;''
 32) ''The soldiers '''who''' were brave ran forward&lt;ref name="bache" /&gt;''
* Nonrestrictive sentences:
 33) ''He has four sons, '''who''' became lawyers&lt;ref name="bache" /&gt;''
 34) ''The soldiers, '''who''' were brave, ran forward&lt;ref name="bache" /&gt;''

====Finiteness of the relative clause determines distribution====
In non-finite clauses (clauses in which the verb is left unconjugated), the relativizer appears as an object of preposition, or in other words, directly after a preposition in the sentence. These relative clauses appear to be introduced by the preposition itself, but they are actually introduced by both the preposition and the relativizer, since these two grammatical particles form a “prepositional phrase”; and it is this phrase that introduces the clause. For example:
 35) A yard in '''which''' to have a party&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;
 36) The baker in '''whom''' to place your trust&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;
 37) A student *'''who''' to talk to us just walked in&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;
Note that (37) is ungrammatical because the relativizer introduces a non-finite relative clause, but it is not contained within a propositional phrase.

==Examples in other languages==

===Indonesian Teochew===
[[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] is a [[Chinese language]] originating from the [[Chaoshan]] region of the eastern Guangdong province.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"&gt;{{cite thesis | degree= Ph.D. |first= Annie |last= Peng |title= Aspects of the Syntax of Indonesian Teochew |publisher= University of Delaware |year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian Teochew refers to the Teochew dialect spoken in [[Indonesia]]. The most common way to form relative clauses in Indonesian Teochew is to use the relativizer ''kai''. These relative clauses can appear head-finally or head-initially.

====Jambi Teochew====
[[Jambi]] Teochew is a variety of Indonesian Teochew that is spoken in the province of Jambi on the island of [[Sumatra]]. In this language, the relativizer ''kai'' is used to form relative clauses. In these relative clauses, the ''kai'' is obligatory. This relativizer comes from the Chinese language. The relativizer ''yang'' is optional, and is borrowed from [[Malay language|Malaysian]]. The relativizer ''kai'' must always follow the modifying clause. If the optional relativizer ''yang'' is used, it would precede the modifying clause, as shown by example #43. If the relativizer ''kai'' is not present, the sentence becomes ungrammatical, regardless of whether ''yang'' is present or not.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; This is demonstrated in example #45.

 38) ''Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
      Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 39) '''''yang''' Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
      '''REL''' Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 40) ''*Aling phaʔ nongkiǎ khau.''
      Aling hit child cry
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 41) ''*'''yang''' Aling phaʔ nongkiǎ khau.''
      '''REL''' Aling hit child cry 
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

Another way of forming relative clauses in Jambi Teochew is through using the classifier. The main difference between the ''kai'' and classifier relative clause is that there is the presence of a classifier in the classifier relative clause.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; The classifier in classifier relative clauses can only appear head-initially.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; The classifier agrees with the head noun type and is in the place of the relativizer ''kai''.

 42) ''ka Aling '''kai''' kau zin tua tsiaʔ.''
       bite Aling '''REL''' dog very big CL.
       ‘The dog that bit Aling is a very big one.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 43) ''ka Aling '''tsiaʔ''' kau zin tua tsiaʔ.''
       bite Aling CL dog very big CL. 
       ‘The dog that big Aling is a very big one.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

Headless relative clauses do not have a pronounced head.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; It is the equivalent of “the one” in English. Headless relative clauses are formed with the relativizer ''kai''.  The Malaysian relativizer ''yang'' can be used optionally before the modifying clause.

 44) ''[zazik khau '''kai'''] si zi su m ui.''
       yesterday cry '''REL''' COP this CL one.
       ‘The one who cried yesterday is this one.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

The relativizer ''kai'' is obligatory.  In addition, it is not possible to form a headless relative clause with a classifier in the place of the relativizer ''kai''.

 45) ''zi pung phou si [Aling sia '''kai'''].''
       this CL book COP Aling write '''REL'''.
       ‘This book is the one that Aling wrote.’

 46) ''*zi pung phou si [Aling sia pung].''
       this CL book COP Aling write CL
       ‘This book is the one that Aling wrote.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

==== Pontianak Teochew ====
[[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] Teochew is a variety of Indonesian Teochew that is spoken in the capital city of Pontianak in the province of [[West Kalimantan]]. The relativizer ''kai'' is used to form relative clauses. It is obligatory in head-final relative clauses. If ''kai'' is not present in the sentence, the sentence becomes ungrammatical, as demonstrated by example #52. Pontianak Teochew does not allow the use of the Malaysian relativizer ''yang''. When this relativizer is present, the sentence becomes ungrammatical. This is shown in example #53.

 47) ''Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
       Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
       ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 48) ''*Aling phaʔ nongkiǎ khau.''
       Aling hit child cry
       ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 49) ''*'''yang''' Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
       '''REL''' Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
       ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

===Ute===
[[Colorado River Numic language|Ute]] is a language that belongs to the Northern Division of the [[Uto-Aztecan]] language family that spans the distance from the Rocky Mountains to Popocatepetl volcano south of Mexico City.

In Ute, relative clauses that modify the subject are introduced in a different manner than those that modify the object. In both cases, there is no overt relativizer morpheme, rather [[nominalization]] and [[Grammatical case|case]] morphology are used to introduce relative clauses.

For example, nominalizing suffixes are attached to verbal elements in subject relative clauses.

 50) '''áapachi 'u [sivaatuchi 'uway paqha-puga-tu]''
      boy.SU 3s.SU  goat.O    3s.O  kill-REM-NOM
      The boy who killed the goat

In relative clauses that are introduced as arguments to an object, the verbal elements are inflected with nominalizing morphology similar to that of their subject relative clause counterparts and the subject of the embedded clause is inflected with the [[genitive]] case.

 51) ''po'oqwatu 'uru [na'achichi 'uway po'o-na]-y punikya-qha-n''
       book.O    the.O girl.GEN  3s.GEN write-NOM-O see-ANT-1s
       I saw the book that the girl is writing

'''Social neuroscience''' is an interdisciplinary field devoted to understanding how [[biological system]]s implement social processes and [[behavior]], and to using biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social processes and behavior. [[Humans]] are fundamentally a social species, rather than individualists. As such, ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' create [[emergent organization]]s beyond the individual—structures that range from dyads, families, and groups to cities, civilizations, and cultures. These emergent structures evolved hand in hand with [[neural]] and [[hormonal]] mechanisms to support them because the consequent social behaviors helped these organisms survive, reproduce, and care for offspring sufficiently long that they too survived to reproduce. The term "social neuroscience" can be traced to a publication entitled "Social Neuroscience Bulletin" that was published quarterly between 1988 and 1994.  The term was subsequently popularized in an article by [[John Cacioppo]] and [[Gary Berntson]], published in [[the American Psychologist]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cacioppo J. T. |author2=Berntson G. G. | year = 1992 | title = Social psychological contributions to the decade of the brain: Doctrine of multilevel analysis | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1019–1028 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.47.8.1019 | pmid=1510329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cacioppo and Berntson are considered as the legitimate fathers of social neuroscience. Still a young field, social [[neuroscience]] is closely related to [[affective neuroscience]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], focusing on how the [[brain]] mediates [[social interaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cacioppo J. T. |author2=Berntson G. G. |author3=Decety J. | year = 2010 | title = Social neuroscience and its relation to social psychology | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 675–684 | doi=10.1521/soco.2010.28.6.675|pmc=3883133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological underpinnings of [[social cognition]] are investigated in [[social cognitive neuroscience]]

==Overview==
Traditional [[neuroscience]] has for many years considered the [[nervous system]] as an isolated entity and largely ignored influences of the social environments in which humans and many animal species live. In fact, we now recognize the considerable impact of social structures on the operations of the brain and body. These social factors operate on the individual through a continuous interplay of neural, [[neuroendocrine]], [[metabolic]] and [[Immune system|immune]] factors on brain and body, in which the brain is the central regulatory organ and also a malleable target of these factors.&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J. T., Berntson, G. G., &amp; Decety, J. (2011). A history of social neuroscience. In A. W. Kruglanski and [[Wolfgang Stroebe|W. Stroebe]] (Eds.), Handbook of the History of Social Psychology. New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Social neuroscience investigates the [[mechanism (biology)|biological mechanisms]] that underlie social processes and behavior, widely considered one of the major problem areas for the [[neuroscience]]s in the 21st century, and applies concepts and methods of [[biology]] to develop [[scientific theories|theories]] of social processes and behavior in the social and [[behavioral sciences]]. Social neuroscience capitalizes on biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social behavior, and it uses social and behavioral constructs and data to advance theories of neural organization and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cacioppo J.T.| year = 2007 | title = Social neuroscience: progress and implications for mental health | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 99–123 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00032.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cacioppo J. T. |author2=Decety J. | year = 2011 | title = Social neuroscience: challenges and opportunities in the study of complex behavior | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1224| issue = | pages = 162–173| doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05858.x | pmid=21251011 | pmc=3098127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout most of the 20th century, social and biological explanations were widely viewed as incompatible. But advances in recent years have led to the development of a new approach synthesized from the social and biological sciences. The new field of social neuroscience emphasizes the complementary relationship between the different levels of organization, spanning the social and biological domains (e.g., [[Molecular biology|molecular]], [[Cellular biology|cellular]], [[Systems biology|system]], person, relational, collective, societal) and the use of multi-level analyses to foster understanding of the mechanisms underlying the human mind and behavior.

==Methods==
A number of methods are used in social neuroscience to investigate the confluence of [[nervous system|neural]] and social processes. These methods draw from behavioral techniques developed in [[social psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[neuropsychology]], and are associated with a variety of neurobiological techniques including [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), [[facial electromyography]] (EMG), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[event-related potential]]s (ERPs), [[electrocardiogram]]s, [[electromyogram]]s, [[endocrinology]], [[immunology]], [[galvanic skin response]] (GSR), single-cell recording, and studies of [[Ataxia#Focal lesions|focal brain lesion]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adolphs R | year = 2003 | title = Investigating the cognitive neuroscience of social behavior | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 119–126 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00142-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J.T., &amp; Berntson, G.G.

In addition, quantitative meta-analyses are important to move beyond idiosyncrasies of individual studies, and neurodevelopmental investigations can contribute to our understanding of brain-behavior associations.&lt;ref&gt;de Haan, M., &amp; Gunnar, M.R. (2009). Handbook of Developmental Social Neuroscience. The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Cacioppo T.T. | year = 2010 | title = Frontiers in human neuroscience, the golden triangle, and beyond | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 767–771 | doi=10.1177/1745691610388780| pmc=3904345}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most popular forms of methods used in social neuroscience are fMRI and EEG. fMRI are very cost efficient and high in spatial resolution. However, they are low in temporal resolution and therefore, are best to discover pathways in the brain that are used during social experiments. fMRI have low temporal resolution (timing) because they read oxygenated blood levels that pool to the parts of the brain that are activated and need more oxygen. Thus, the blood takes time to travel to the part of the brain being activated and in reverse provides a lower ability to test for exact timing of activation during social experiments. EEG is best used when a researcher is trying to brain map a certain area that correlates to a [[social construct]] that is being studied. EEGs provide high temporal resolution but low spatial resolution. In which, the timing of the activation is very accurate but it is hard to pinpoint exact areas on the brain, researchers are to narrow down locations and areas but they also create a lot of "noise". Most recently, researchers have been using TMS which is the best way to discover the exact location in the process of brain mapping. This machine can turn on and off parts of the brain which then allows researchers to test what that part of the brain is used for during social events. However, this machine is so expensive that it is rarely used.

Note: Most of these methods can only provide correlations between brain mapping and social events (apart from TMS), a con of Social Neuroscience is that the research must be interpreted through correlations which can cause a decreased content validity. For example, during an experiment when a participant is doing a task to test for a social theory and a part of the brain is activated, it is impossible to form causality because anything else in the room or the thoughts of the person could have triggered that response. It is very hard to isolate these variables during these experiments. That is why self-reports are very important. This will also help decrease the chances of VooDoo correlations (correlations that are too high and over 0.8 which look like a correlation exists between two factors but actually is just an error in design and statistical measures). Another way to avoid this con, is to use tests with hormones which can infer causality. For example, when people are given oxytocin and placebos and we can test their differences in social behavior between other people. Using SCRs will also help isolate unconscious thoughts and conscious thoughts because it is the body's natural parasympathetic response to the outside world. All of these tests and devices will help social neuroscientists discover the connections in the brain that are used to carry out our everyday social activities.

Primarily [[psychology|psychological]] methods include performance-based measures that record response time and/or accuracy,&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012). The Student's Guide to Social Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Implicit Association Test]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greenwald A. G. |author2=McGhee D. E. |author3=Schwartz J. L. K. | year = 1998 | title = Measuring individual differences in implicit cognition: The Implicit Association Test | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 1464–1480 | doi =  10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464}}&lt;/ref&gt; observational measures such as preferential looking in infant studies; and, self-report measures, such as questionnaire and interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012). The Student's Guide to Social Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurobiological methods can be grouped together into ones that measure more external bodily responses, electrophysiological methods, hemodynamic measures, and lesion methods. 
Bodily response methods include GSR (also known as skin conductance response (SCR)), facial EMG, and the eyeblink startle response. Electrophysiological methods include single-cell recordings, EEG, and ERPs. Hemodynamic measures, which, instead of directly measuring neural activity, measure changes in blood flow, include PET and fMRI. Lesion methods traditionally study brains that have been damaged via natural causes, such as strokes, traumatic injuries, tumors, neurosurgery, infection, or neurodegenerative disorders. In its ability to create a type of 'virtual lesion' that is temporary, TMS may also be included in this category. More specifically, TMS methods involve stimulating one area of the brain to isolate it from the rest of the brain, imitating a brain lesion. This is particularly helpful in brain mapping, a key approach in social neuroscience designed to determine which areas of the brain are activated during certain activities.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012).

While [[animal testing on rodents|rodent studies]] of gene expression predominately measure the consequences of depriving the animals of sensory experiences, a study has also been conducted measuring the consequences of enriching animal sensory experiences on prefrontal cortex development, via tactile stimulation by researchers for 45 minutes per day for the approximately first two weeks of life.  What was discovered was that infants, who received additional tactile stimulation exhibited greater motor performance and spatial learning, in addition to enhanced cerebral cortex synaptic organization, in adulthood, than infants who did not receive additional tactile stimulation.  These findings reinforce the significance of tactile stimulation in early stages of postnatal development and neurogenesis for rodent models.  Because non-human animal studies typically concern either, the presence and absence of parents, or the presence and absence of tactile stimulation, the findings of animal studies on gene expression are likely more comparable to human cases of neglect, as opposed to physical or sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb et al., [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/10/04/1121251109.long "Experience and the developing prefrontal cortex"], "PNAS", 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society for Social Neuroscience==
A dinner to discuss the challenges and opportunities in the interdisciplinary field of social neuroscience at the [[Society for Neuroscience]] meeting ([[Chicago]], November 2009) resulted in a series of meetings led by [[John Cacioppo]] and [[Jean Decety]] with social neuroscientists, [[psychologists]], [[neuroscientist]]s, [[psychiatrists]] and [[neurologist]]s in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[China]], [[Colombia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Social neuroscience was defined broadly as the interdisciplinary study of the neural, hormonal, cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying the emergent structures that define social species. Thus, among the participants in these meetings were scientists who used a wide variety of methods in studies of animals as well as humans, and patients as well as normal participants. The consensus also emerged that a Society for Social Neuroscience should be established to give scientists from diverse disciplines and perspectives the opportunity to meet, communicate with, and benefit from the work of each other. The international, interdisciplinary [[Society for social neuroscience]] (http://S4SN.org) was launched at the conclusion of these consultations in [[Auckland]], New Zealand on 20 January 2010, and the inaugural meeting for the Society was held on November 12, 2010, the day prior to the 2010 Society for Neuroscience meeting ([[San Diego]], CA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4587">[[File:Supertorus_table.png|thumb|400px|right|Supertoroids with a=b=2, and different combinations for the parameters s and t.]]

In [[geometry]] and [[computer graphics]], a '''supertoroid''' or '''supertorus''' is usually understood to be a family of [[doughnut]]-like [[surface (geometry)|surfaces]] (technically, a [[topology|topological]] [[torus (mathematics)|torus]]) whose shape is defined by mathematical formulas similar to those that define the [[superquadric]]s. The plural of "supertorus" is either '''supertori''' or '''supertoruses'''.

The family was described and named by [[Alan H.Barr|Alan Barr]] in 1994.&lt;ref name=barr&gt;Alan H. Barr (1981) ''Superquadrics and Angle-Preserving Transformations''. IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 1 issue 1. pp. 11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Barr's supertoroids have been fairly popular in computer graphics as a convenient model for many objects, such as smooth frames for rectangular things. One quarter of a supertoroid can provide a smooth and seamless 90-degree joint between two superquadric [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s.  However, they are not [[algebraic surface]]s (except in special cases). 

==Formulas==
Alan Barr's supertoroids are defined by parametric equations similar to the [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] equations of the torus, except that the [[sine]] and [[cosine]] terms are raised to arbitrary [[exponentiation|powers]]. Namely, the generic point ''P''(''u'', ''v'') of the surface is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
P(u,v) = \left(\begin{array}{c}
  X(u,v)\\
  Y(u,v)\\
  Z(u,v)
\end{array}\right)
= 
\left(\begin{array}{c}
  (a + C_{u}^{s}) C_{v}^{t}\\
  (b + C_{u}^{s}) S_{v}^{t}\\
  S_{u}^{s}
\end{array}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C_{\theta}^{\epsilon} = \operatorname{sgn}(\cos \theta)\left|\cos\theta\right|^\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{\theta}^{\epsilon} = \operatorname{sgn}(\sin \theta)\left|\sin\theta\right|^\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, and the parameters ''u'' and ''v'' range from 0 to 360 degrees (0 to 2''π'' [[radian]]s).

In these formulas, the parameter ''s'' &amp;gt; 0 controls the "squareness" of the vertical sections, ''t'' &amp;gt; 0 controls the squareness of the horizontal sections, and ''a'', ''b'' ≥ 1 are  the major radii in the ''X'' and ''Y'' directions. With ''s''=''t''=1 and ''a''=''b''=''R'' one obtains the ordinary torus with major radius ''R'' and minor radius 1, with the center at the origin and [[symmetry|rotational symmetry]] about the ''Z'' axis.

In general, the supertorus defined as above spans the [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]] &lt;math&gt;[-(a+1),+(a+1)]&lt;/math&gt; in ''X'',  &lt;math&gt;[-(b+1),+(b+1)]&lt;/math&gt; in ''Y'', and &lt;math&gt;[-1,+1]&lt;/math&gt; in ''Z''.  The whole shape is symmetric about the planes ''X''=0, ''Y''=0, and ''Z''=0.  The hole runs in the ''Z'' direction and spans the intervals &lt;math&gt;[-(a-1),+(a-1)]&lt;/math&gt; in ''X'' and  &lt;math&gt;[-(b-1),+(b-1)]&lt;/math&gt; in ''Y''.

A curve of constant ''u'' on this surface is an horizontal [[Lamé curve]] with exponent 2/''t'', scaled in ''X'' and ''Y'' and displaced in ''Z''.  A curve of constant ''v'', projected on the plane ''X''=0 or ''Y''=0, is a Lamé curve with exponent 2/''s'', scaled and horizontally shifted.  If ''v'' is 0, the curve is planar and spans the interval &lt;math&gt;[a-1,a+1]&lt;/math&gt; in ''X'', and &lt;math&gt;[-1,+1]&lt;/math&gt; in ''Z''; and similarly if ''v'' is 90, 180, or 270 degrees.  The curve is planar also if ''a'' = ''b''.

In general, if ''a''≠''b'' and ''v'' is not a multiple of 90 degrees, the curve of constant ''v'' will not be planar; and, conversely, a vertical plane section of the supertorus will not be a Lamé curve. 

The basic supertoroid shape defined above is often modified by non-uniform scaling to yield supertoroids of specific width, length, and vertical thickness.

==Plotting code==

The following [[GNU Octave]] code generates plots of a supertorus:

&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
 function supertoroid(epsilon,a)
  n=50;
  d=.1;
  etamax=pi;
  etamin=-pi;
  wmax=pi;
  wmin=-pi;
  deta=(etamax-etamin)/n;
  dw=(wmax-wmin)/n;
  k=0;
  l=0;
  for i=1:n+1
    eta(i)=etamin+(i-1)*deta;
    for j=1:n+1
      w(j)=wmin+(j-1)*dw;
      x(i,j)=a(1)*(a(4)+sign(cos(eta(i)))*abs(cos(eta(i)))^epsilon(1))*sign(cos(w(j)))*abs(cos(w(j)))^epsilon(2);
      y(i,j)=a(2)*(a(4)+sign(cos(eta(i)))*abs(cos(eta(i)))^epsilon(1))*sign(sin(w(j)))*abs(sin(w(j)))^epsilon(2);
      z(i,j)=a(3)*sign(sin(eta(i)))*abs(sin(eta(i)))^epsilon(1);
    endfor;
  endfor;
   mesh(x,y,z);
 endfunction;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Symbolic communication''' is exchange of messages that change ''a priori'' expectation of events. Examples of this are modern [[communication]] technology and the exchange of information amongst animals. 
By referring to objects and ideas not present at the time of communication, a world of possibility is opened. In humans, this process has been compounded to result in our current state of modernity.

==Animal Societies==
{{See also|Animal communication|Bee learning and communication}}
In animal societies, symbolic communication helps one understand the conduct of members of cooperating groups. The behavior of [[weaver ant]] workers has been carefully studied and it has been found that communicative gestures with respect to members of the same [[colony]] are different from those used with intruders. The interpretation of the symbolic dance of [[honey bee]]s as a communicative language has been questioned by a few, though numerous experimental results over the last several decades have effectively laid this controversy to rest.

==Human Societies==
An example of symbolic communication in  humans is the wearing of uniforms.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} A man in a white coat with a stethoscope will often be perceived as a doctor on the basis of his appearance alone. Military uniforms have badges and insignias which indicate rank and honours as well as their branch of operation. Humans are the only species who use a symbolic language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gärdenfors|first=Peter|year=2004|title=13Cooperation and the Evolution of Symbolic Communication|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30820582/2004_MIT_EvolutionOfCommunication.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1480437082&amp;Signature=5%2FcPLjb2v%2FdlbFteER5AT5UDFX4%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DSocial_and_cultural_learning_in_the_evol.pdf#page=248|journal=Evolution of Communication Systems|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This probably isn't really the article's lead; as sections are added,
text shd move into 'graphics rendering' and be replaced by a more general introduction--&gt;

In [[computer graphics]], [[tessellation]] is used to manage datasets of polygons (sometimes called ''vertex sets'') presenting objects in a scene and divide them into suitable structures for [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]]. Especially for [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time rendering]], data is [[polygon triangulation|tessellated into triangles]], for example in [[OpenGL|OpenGL 4.0]] and [[Direct3D 11]].&lt;ref name=OpenGL&gt;[http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec40.core.20100311.pdf The OpenGL® Graphics System: A Specification (Version 4.0 (Core Profile) - March 11, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MS&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff476340%28v=VS.85%29.aspx MSDN: Tessellation Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In graphics rendering==

A key advantage of tessellation for [[realtime graphics]] is that it allows detail to be dynamically added and subtracted from a [[3D polygon mesh]] and its silhouette edges based on control parameters (often camera distance). In previously leading realtime techniques such as [[parallax mapping]] and [[bump mapping]], surface details could be simulated at the pixel level, but silhouette edge detail was fundamentally limited by the quality of the original dataset.

In [[Direct3D 11]] pipeline (a part of DirectX 11), the [[graphics primitive]] is the [[Bézier curve|patch]].&lt;ref name=Abi-Chahla2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Abi-Chahla|first=Fedy|title=Tessellation|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/opengl-directx,2019-7.html|publisher=Tom's Hardware|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tessellator'' generates a triangle-based [[tessellation]] of the patch according to tessellation parameters such as the ''TessFactor'', which controls the degree of fineness of the [[polygon mesh|mesh]]. The tessellation, along with [[shader]]s such as a [[Phong shading|Phong shader]], allows for producing smoother surfaces than would be generated by the original mesh.&lt;ref name=Abi-Chahla2013 /&gt; By offloading the tessellation process onto the [[GPU]] hardware, smoothing can be performed in real time. Tessellation can also be used for implementing [[subdivision surface]]s, [[level of detail]] scaling and fine [[displacement mapping]].&lt;ref name=Tariq2009&gt;{{cite web|last=Tariq|first=Sara|title=D3D11 Tessellation|url=http://developer.download.nvidia.com/presentations/2009/GDC/GDC09_D3D11Tessellation.pdf|publisher=Nvida|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[OpenGL|OpenGL 4.0]] uses a similar pipeline, where tessellation into triangles is controlled by the ''[[Tessellation Control Shader]]'' and a set of four tessellation parameters.&lt;ref name=OpenGLTess&gt;{{cite web|title=Tessellation|url=http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Tessellation#Tessellation_control_shader|publisher=OpenGL|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computer-aided design==

In [[computer-aided design]] the constructed design is represented by a [[boundary representation]] topological model, where analytical 3D surfaces and curves, limited to faces, edges, and vertices, constitute a continuous boundary of a 3D body.
Arbitrary 3D bodies are often too complicated to analyze directly. So they are approximated (tessellated) with a [[polygon mesh|mesh]] of small, easy-to-analyze pieces of 3D volume—usually either irregular [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]], or irregular [[hexahedron|hexahedra]]. The mesh is used for [[finite element analysis]].

The mesh of a surface is usually generated per individual faces and edges (approximated to [[Polygonal chain|polylines]]) so that original limit vertices are included into mesh. To ensure that approximation of the original surface suits the needs of further processing, three basic parameters are usually defined for the surface mesh generator:

* The maximum allowed distance between the planar approximation polygon and the surface (known as "sag"). This parameter ensures that mesh is similar enough to the original analytical surface (or the polyline is similar to the original curve).
* The maximum allowed size of the approximation polygon (for triangulations it can be maximum allowed length of triangle sides). This parameter ensures enough detail for further analysis.
* The maximum allowed angle between two adjacent approximation polygons (on the same face). This parameter ensures that even very small humps or hollows that can have significant effect to analysis will not disappear in mesh.

An algorithm generating a mesh is typically controlled by the above three and other parameters. Some types of computer analysis of a constructed design require an [[adaptive mesh refinement]], which is a mesh made finer (using stronger parameters) in regions where the analysis needs more detail.&lt;ref name=OpenGL/&gt;&lt;ref name=MS/&gt;

Parts were reprinted in ''The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You to Read'' edited by Tim C. Leedom in 1994, and it was republished in its entirety in 2001.

The book is often used as a source by [[Christ myth theory]] proponents, such as [[Dorothy M. Murdock]],&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Casey Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? T&amp;T Clark 2014 p21-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truthbeknown.com/beddru.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Harpur]], and [[John G. Jackson (writer)|John G. Jackson]].  Many of the same theories espoused in the book are repeated in the documentaries ''[[The God Who Wasn't There]]'', ''[[The Pagan Christ#CBC documentary|The Pagan Christ]]'', ''[[Zeitgeist: The Movie]]'' and ''[[Religulous]]''.

[[American Atheists]] leader [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] was a fan of the book.  While modern-day American historian [[Richard Carrier]] found the book to be incomplete, he appreciated some of its points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/graves.html infidels.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

Graves, often citing ''[[Anacalypsis]]'' and other works by [[Godfrey Higgins]] (1772–1833) as his source, asserts in the book that many messiah-like "saviors" were crucified on a cross or tree before ascending into heaven.

"One thing is clear — the mythos of the Hindus, the mythos of the Jews and the mythos of the Greeks are all at bottom the same; and what are called their early histories are not histories of humankind, but are contrivances under the appearance of histories to perpetuate doctrines."  (Higgins, ''Anacalypsis'')

The book claims that a number of these deities or god-men shared at least some traits of Jesus as described in the New Testament, drawing the strongest similarities with Krishna.  For example, some figures had miraculous or virgin births, were sons of supreme gods, were born on December 25, had stars point to their birthplaces, were visited by shepherds and magi as infants, fled from death as children, exhibited traits of divinity in childhood, spent time in the desert, traveled as they taught, had disciples, performed miracles, were persecuted, were crucified, descended into hell after death, appeared as resurrections or apparitions, or ascended into heaven.  Graves also devotes chapters to the pagan roots of [[baptism]] and the [[eucharist]], and concludes that Jesus was not a real person.

==Quotes==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Here I desire to impress upon the minds of my clerical brethren the important fact, that the gospel histories of Christ were written by men who had formerly been Jews (see Acts xxi. 20), and probably possessing the strong proclivity to imitate and borrow which their bible shows  was characteristic of that nation&amp;nbsp;; and being written many years after Christ's death, according to that standard Christian author, Dr. Lardner, it was impossible, under such circumstances, for them to separate (if they had desired to) the real facts and events of his life from the innumerable fictions and fables then afloat everywhere relative to the heathen Gods who had pre-enacted a similar history. Two reasons are thus furnished for their constructing a history of Christ almost identical with that of other Gods, as shown in chapters XXX., XXXI. and XXXII. of this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Kersey|authorlink=Kersey Graves|title=The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors: Or, Christianity Before Christ, Containing New, Startling, and Extraordinary Revelations in Religious History, which Disclose the Oriental Origin of All the Doctrines, Principles, Precepts, and Miracles of the Christian New Testament, and Furnishing a Key for Unlocking Many of Its Sacred Mysteries, Besides Comprising the History of 16 Heathen Crucified Gods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGAwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA22|year=1875|publisher=Freethought Press|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==

American historian [[Richard Carrier]], a supporter of the [[Christ myth theory]], has written online about his concerns with ''The Sixteen Crucified Saviors''.  For example, Price argues that Graves often omits citations, uses dubious sources, mixes opinions with facts, and draws conclusions beyond the evidence presented. However, according to Carrier, there is no comprehensive rebuttal of the book, and although many of his facts are wrong, others assertions such as a December 25 birthdate among Greco-Roman sun gods are now acknowledged to be correct. Carrier argues there is a better case for the resurrection of Thracian god [[Zalmoxis]] (also called Salmoxis or Gebele'izis) and the crucifixion and resurrection of Sumerian goddess [[Inanna]] (also known as Ishtar), neither of whom are mentioned by Graves.&lt;ref&gt;http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/graves.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Trudeau Landing''' Site ([[Smithsonian trinomial|16 WF 25]]), also known as  ''Tunica Village'' and ''Trudeau'', is an [[archaeological site]] in [[Tunica, Louisiana|Tunica]], [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana|West Feliciana Parish]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States]]. It was [[History of the Tunica people|once occupied by the Tunica]] tribe. Later it was developed by Europeans as the Trudeau Plantation. 

==Tunica treasure==
In the 1960s, graves at the site were dug up by a local self-described treasure hunter, who worked as a guard at Louisiana State Prison (Angola). He took many artifacts from the area, which had been deposited as grave goods with the more than 100 graves. [[Tunica people|The Tunica]] felt that he had stolen tribal heirlooms and desecrated the graves of their ancestors and were outraged at the violations. He tried to sell the artifacts to the Peabody Museum at Harvard University, but the transaction stalled when the museum found that he did not have legal title to the items.

In the 1970s, the site was excavated by archaeologists, who uncovered large amounts of pottery, European trade goods, and other [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s deposited as grave goods by the Tunica from 1731 to 1764 when they were in residence. With help from the State of [[Louisiana]], the tribe filed a lawsuit to obtain the [[Title (property)|title]] to the artifacts.

A decade passed in the courts, but the ruling became a landmark in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] history, and it helped lay the groundwork for new [[U.S. government|Federal]] legislation, the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]], passed in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.crt.state.la.us/archaeology/TUNICA/today.htm|title= On the Tunica Trail-Tunica Biloxi Today|accessdate= 2010-02-10|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070919035153/http://www.crt.state.la.us/archaeology/TUNICA/today.htm|archivedate= 2007-09-19|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used to prove the ancient heritage of the Tunica peoples, and helped them to gain state and [[List of federally recognized tribes by state|Federal recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tunica-Biloxi|author=[[Jeffrey P. Brain]]|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|year=1990|isbn=1-55546-731-8|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A museum to house the artifacts was built by the [[Tunica-Biloxi]], in [[Marksville, Louisiana]]. They are using it also as a conservation and education center for preservation of their artifacts.

'''Vernalization''' (from [[Latin]] ''vernus'', "of the [[spring (season)|spring]]") is the induction of a plant's [[flower]]ing process by exposure to the prolonged cold of winter, or by an artificial equivalent. After vernalization, plants have acquired the ability to flower, but they may require additional seasonal cues or weeks of growth before they will actually flower. Vernalization is sometimes used to refer to herbal (non-woody) plants requiring a cold dormancy to produce new shoots and leaves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sokolski |first1=K. |last2=Dovholuk |first2=A. |last3=Dovholuk |first3=L. |last4=Faletra |first4=P. |title=Axenic seed culture and micropropagation of ''Cypripedium reginae'' |journal=Selbyana |volume=18 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=172–82 |jstor=41760430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this usage is discouraged.&lt;ref name = "chouard"&gt;{{cite journal

Many plants grown in [[temperate]] climates require vernalization and must experience a period of low winter temperature to initiate or accelerate the flowering process. This ensures that reproductive development and seed production occurs in spring and winters, rather than in autumn.&lt;ref name = "sung"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=Sibum |last2=He |first2=Yuehui |last3=Eshoo |first3=Tifani W |last4=Tamada |first4=Yosuke |last5=Johnson |first5=Lianna |last6=Nakahigashi |first6=Kenji |last7=Goto |first7=Koji |last8=Jacobsen |first8=Steve E |last9=Amasino |first9=Richard M |title=Epigenetic maintenance of the vernalized state in Arabidopsis thaliana requires LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=706–10 |year=2006 |pmid=16682972 |doi=10.1038/ng1795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The needed cold is often expressed in [[chilling requirement|chill hours]]. Typical vernalization temperatures are between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius (40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit).{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

For many [[perennial plants]], such as [[fruit tree]] species, a period of cold is needed first to induce dormancy and then later, after the requisite period of time, re-emerge from that dormancy prior to flowering. Many [[monocarpic]] winter [[annual plant|annuals]] and [[biennial plant|biennials]], including some [[ecotype]]s of ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Michaels |first1=Scott D. |last2=He |first2=Yuehui |last3=Scortecci |first3=Katia C. |last4=Amasino |first4=Richard M. |title=Attenuation of FLOWERING LOCUS C activity as a mechanism for the evolution of summer-annual flowering behavior in Arabidopsis |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=100 |issue=17 |pages=10102–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12904584 |pmc=187779 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1531467100 |jstor=3147669 |bibcode=2003PNAS..10010102M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and winter [[cereals]] such as [[wheat]], must go through a prolonged period of cold before flowering occurs.

==History of vernalization research==
In the [[history of agriculture]], farmers observed a traditional distinction between "winter cereals", whose seeds require chilling (to trigger their subsequent emergence and growth), and "spring cereals", whose seeds can be sown in spring, and germinate, and then flower soon thereafter. Scientists in the early 19th century had discussed how some plants needed cold temperatures to  flower. In 1857 an American agriculturist [[John Hancock Klippart]], Secretary of the Ohio Board of Agriculture, reported the importance and effect of winter temperature on the germination of wheat. One of the most significant works was by a German plant physiologist [[Gustav Gassner]] &lt;!-- .de version exists --&gt; who made a detailed discussion in his 1918 paper. Gassner was the first to systematically differentiate the specific requirements of winter plants from those of summer plants, and also that early swollen germinating seeds of winter cereals are sensitive to cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chouard|first1=P|title=Vernalization and its relations to dormancy|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|date=1960|volume=11|issue=1|pages=191–238|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.11.060160.001203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1928 a Russian geneticist [[Trofim Lysenko]] published his works on the effects of cold on cereal seeds, and coined the term "яровизация" ("jarovization") to describe a chilling process he used to make the seeds of winter cereals behave like spring cereals (''Jarovoe'' in Russian, originally from ''jar'' meaning fire or the god of spring). Lysenko himself translated the term into "vernalization" (from the Latin ''vernum'' meaning Spring). After Lysenko the term was used to explain the ability of flowering in some plants after a period of chilling due to physiological changes and external factors. The formal definition was given in 1960 by a French botanist P. Chouard, as "the acquisition or acceleration of the ability to flower by a chilling treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poltronieri|first1=Palmiro|last2=Hong|first2=Yiguo|title=Applied Plant Genomics and Biotechnology|date=2015|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|location=Cambridge (UK)|isbn=978-0-08-100068-7|page=121|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMIcBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lysenko's 1928 paper on vernalization and [[plant physiology]] drew wide attention due to its practical consequences for Russian agriculture. Severe cold and lack of winter snow had destroyed many early winter wheat seedlings. By treating wheat seeds with moisture as well as cold, Lysenko induced them to bear a crop when planted in spring.&lt;ref name="lysenkosci"&gt;{{cite journal| first1= Nils |last1=Roll-Hansen| year = 1985| title = A new perspective on Lysenko?| journal = [[Annals of Science]]| volume = 42| pmid = 11620694| issue = 3| pages = 261–278| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| doi = 10.1080/00033798500200201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later however, Lysenko inaccurately asserted that the vernalized state could be inherited, i.e. the offspring of a vernalized plant would behave as if they themselves had also been vernalized and would not require vernalization in order to flower quickly.&lt;ref name = "amasino"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amasino|first1=R.|title=Vernalization, competence, and the epigenetic memory of winter|journal=The Plant Cell|date=2004|volume=16|issue=10|pages=2553–2559|doi=10.1105/tpc.104.161070|pmid=15466409|pmc=520954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early research on vernalization focused on plant physiology; the increasing availability of molecular biology has made it possible to unravel its underlying mechanisms.&lt;ref name = "amasino"/&gt; For example, a lengthening daylight period (longer days), ''as well as'' cold temperatures are required for winter wheat plants to go from the vegetative to the reproductive state; the three interacting genes are called ''VRN1'', ''VRN2'', and ''FT'' (''VRN3'').&lt;ref name = "trevaskis"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to plant flowering requiring the successful co-operation of several [[metabolic pathway]]s, computer models that incorporate vernalization have also been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New Genetic Model Predicts Plant Flowering in Different Environments |publisher=Brown University |date=January 15, 2009 |url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2009/01/arabidopsis |accessdate=March 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ''Arabidopsis thaliana''==
[[File:Arabidopsis thaliana rosette.png|thumb|''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' rosette before vernalization, with no floral spike]]
''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' ("thale cress") is a much-studied model for vernalization. Some ecotypes (varieties), called "winter annuals", have delayed flowering without vernalization; others ("summer annuals") do not.&lt;ref name ="pbvr"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.plant-biology.com/vernalisation-response.php

The reproductive phase change of ''A. thaliana'' occurs by a sequence of two related events: first, the [[Bolting (horticulture)|bolting]] transition (flower stalk elongates), then the floral transition (first flower appears).&lt;ref name=pouteau&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pouteau |first1=Sylvie |last2=Albertini |first2=Catherine |title=The significance of bolting and floral transitions as indicators of reproductive phase change in ''Arabidopsis'' |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=60 |issue=12 |pages=3367–77 |year=2009 |pmid=19502535 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erp173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bolting is a robust predictor of flower formation, and hence a good indicator for vernalization research.&lt;ref name = "pouteau"/&gt;

In winter annual ''Arabidopsis'', vernalization of the [[meristem]] appears to confer competence to respond to floral inductive signals. A vernalized meristem retains competence for as long as 300 days in the absence of an inductive signal.&lt;ref name ="pbvr"/&gt;

At the molecular level, flowering is repressed by the protein ''Flowering Locus C'' (''FLC''), which binds to and represses genes that promote flowering, thus blocking flowering.&lt;ref name = "sung"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Amasino |first1=Richard |title=Seasonal and developmental timing of flowering |journal=The Plant Journal |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=1001–13 |year=2010 |pmid=20409274 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04148.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter annual ecotypes of Arabidopsis have an active copy of the gene ''FRIGIDA'' (''FRI''), which promotes ''FLC'' expression, thus repression of flowering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Choi |first1=Kyuha |last2=Kim |first2=Juhyun |last3=Hwang |first3=Hyun-Ju |last4=Kim |first4=Sanghee |last5=Park |first5=Chulmin |last6=Kim |first6=Sang Yeol |last7=Lee |first7=Ilha |title=The FRIGIDA Complex Activates Transcription ofFLC, a Strong Flowering Repressor inArabidopsis, by Recruiting Chromatin Modification Factors |journal=The Plant Cell |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=289–303 |year=2011 |pmid=21282526 |pmc=3051252 |doi=10.1105/tpc.110.075911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prolonged exposure to cold (vernalization) induces expression of ''VERNALIZATION INSENSTIVE3'', which interacts with the ''VERNALIZATION2'' polycomb-like complex to reduce ''FLC'' expression through chromatin remodeling.&lt;ref name = "Sung and Amasino"&gt;{{cite journal

Since vernalization also occurs in ''flc'' mutants (lacking ''FLC''), vernalization must also activate a non-''FLC'' pathway.&lt;ref name ="pbvp"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.plant-biology.com/vernalisation-pathway-Arabidopsis.php

==Devernalization==
It is possible to devernalize a plant by 
exposure to sometimes low and  high temperatures subsequent to vernalization. For example, commercial [[onion]] growers store sets at low temperatures, but devernalize them before planting, because they want the plant's energy to go into enlarging its bulb (underground stem), not making flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
|encyclopedia= Eopædia Britannica Online
|title= Vernalization
|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/626291/vernalization
|quote= vernalization, the artificial exposure of plants (or seeds) to low temperatures in order to stimulate flowering or to enhance seed production. By satisfying the cold requirement of many temperate-zone plants, flowering can be induced to occur earlier than normal or in warm climates lacking the requisite seasonal chilling.

A '''volvelle''' or '''wheel chart''' is a type of [[slide chart]], a [[paper]] construction with rotating parts. It is considered an early example of a paper [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nick Kanas|title=VOLVELLES!

Early examples of volvelles are found in the pages of [[astronomy]] books. They can be traced back to "certain [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabic treatises on humoral medicine]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Origin of Polyalphabetic Substitution|author=David Kahn|author-link=David Kahn (writer)|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume=71|issue=1|date=March 1980|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|pages=122–127 [126]|jstor=230316|doi=10.1086/352410 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Persian astronomer]], [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] (c. 1000), who made important contributions to the development of the volvelle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=State, Science and Economy in Traditional Societies: Some Problems in Weberian Sociology of Science|author=Bryan S.

In the twentieth century, the volvelle had many diverse uses. In ''Reinventing the Wheel'', author [[Jessica Helfand]] introduces twentieth-century volvelles with this:

{{quote|The twentieth century saw a robust growth in the design, manufacture, and production of a new generation of independent, free-standing volvelles. Categorically, they not only represent an unusually eclectic set of uses, but demonstrate, too, a remarkable range of stylistic, compositional, mechanical, informational, and kinetic conceits. There are volvelles that arrange their data peripherally, centrifugally, and radially; volvelles that use multiple concentric circles with pointers; and volvelles that benefit from the generous use of the die-cut, a particular technological hallmark of modern printing manufacture. Twentieth-century volvelles—often referred to as ''wheel charts''—offer everything from inventory control to color calibration, mileage metering to verb conjugation. They anticipate animal breeding cycles and calculate radiation exposure, measure chocolate consumption and quantify bridge tips, chart bird calls, convert metrics, and calculate taxes. There are fortune-telling wheels and semaphore-charting wheels; emergency first-aid wheels and electronic fix-it wheels; playful wheels that test phonetics and prophylactic wheels that prevent pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reinventing the Wheel|author=[[Jessica Helfand]]|publisher=[[Princeton Architectural Press]]|date=2002|isbn=978-1-56898-596-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lA26DBJI2YkC&amp;dq=helfand+%22reinventing+the+wheel%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] employed a volvelle in the sleeve design for the album ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' (1970).

Two games from the game company [[Infocom]] included volvelles inside their package as "[[feelie]]s": ''[[Sorcerer (video game)|Sorcerer]]'' (1983) and ''[[A Mind Forever Voyaging]]'' (1985). Both volvelles served to impede copying of the games, because they contained information needed to play the game.
