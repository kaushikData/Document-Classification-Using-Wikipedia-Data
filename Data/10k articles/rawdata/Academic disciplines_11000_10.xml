      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">An '''active surface''' is a surface of a [[radio telescope]] that is under active computer control of its shape.

Large (more than  10&amp;nbsp;m in diameter or length) radio telescopes always bend during operation, due to their enormous weight and the fact that even the strongest materials are not perfectly stiff.  This bending, in the range of a few millimetres, does not affect low frequency operation much, but dramatically reduces the efficiency of the telescope at higher frequencies where the wavelengths are comparable to the distortion.  Typically, the efficiency of a telescope drops appreciably when the deviation from the desired shape is more than 1/10 of the considered wavelength.  An active surface uses numerous small actuators to move the surface panels with respect to the underlying frame, and thus maintain the correct shape.

An active surface can try to compensate for many different types of errors.  The first is gravity&amp;mdash;this is simplest since previous measurements, or even a mathematical model, can be used to predict (and correct) any bending.  More difficult is correction for wind and thermal errors, since these require measuring and correcting in real time.

Some examples of active surfaces are:
*[[Green Bank Telescope]]
*[[Large Millimeter Telescope]]
*[[Sardinia Radio Telescope]]
*[[Noto Radio Observatory]]

The Chinese [[Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope]] uses a uniquely ambitious form of active surface, not only correcting errors, but applying deflections of up to {{convert|47|cm}} in order to aim and focus the telescope.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21025">'''Agroscope''' is the Swiss Confederation’s centre of excellence for agricultural research, and is affiliated with the Federal Office for Agriculture, which in turn is subordinate to the [[Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research]]. Agroscope makes an important contribution to a sustainable agriculture and food sector as well as to an intact environment, thereby contributing to an improved quality of life.

== Goals ==

Agroscope researches along the entire value chain of the agriculture and food sector. Its aims are a competitive and multifunctional agricultural sector, high-quality food for a healthy diet, and an intact environment. The Research Station gears its work to the needs of the recipients of its services.

== History ==

'''History until 1850'''

The importance in many regions of the Swiss Plateau was dominated for centuries by the three-field technique. This three-span rotation was divided as follows:

**1st Year: Winter wheat
**2nd Year: Summer grain (usually oats or barley)
**3rd Year: fallow

In each field possessed the farmer his individual acre. It was not a working association of farmers, but of a village community. The three-field did not let an intensive livestock. The common grazing on the fallow, the unfertilized Allmend and the stubble fields, and the lack of winter feeding offered only a meager food. For centuries, forest trees were debranched for winter feed. Agriculture froze in the three-field.

For agriculture, the 18th Century, means the dawn of a new, better era. Young country gentlemen took the management of their estates into their own hands and sought to agriculture, especially livestock raising and promote. The chains of the three-field  technique were broken. They began with the stall-feeding, careful storage of manure, and built on the former fields potatoes and clover. The common land was parceled out and divided among the peasants. A new goal came to the fore, namely, to keep enough cattle to supply their own country with enough manure. In the midst of these developments, the French Revolution broke out. The world was open for innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''First stations for education an controlling (1850–1880)'''

During the second half of the 19th century, humans had to adapt to the requirements of an industrialized community. Completely new technologies changed their lives and natural sciences offered completely different explanations for life procedures and agricultural production than before.

In the 19th century Switzerland therefore starts to install local agricultural institutes. With the new Federal Constitution of 1848 the modern welfare state begins to develop. In the Fifties the first, however very modest [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] were paid to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lehmann, Josef 2003:19-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Till the middle of the 19th century people had to cultivate their bread grain by themselves. For the authorities, the major task of agriculture was the self-sufficiency of states with grain. Only until 1860, larger quantities of grain were imported from the Danube countries and from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lehmann, Josef 2003:27&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The birth of the research stations (1874–1914)'''

The Federal Government's first step towards agricultural research stations was the development of ETH Zurich, where the first two federal agricultural experimental stations were established in 1878: the Swiss Federal Seed Control Station and the Swiss Federal Agricultural Chemistry Experimental Station. Both stations grew very quickly. The Seed Control Station in particular developed into a world-renowned institute. Its founder, Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler led it expertly and successfully for 42 years. The topics studied included fertilisers and feedstuffs, soils, milk, wines, farm fertilisers etc.. A focal point was the further development of analysis methods.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lehmann, Josef 2003:29&lt;/ref&gt; This provided the starting point for the subsequent founding of the Reckenholz location of the present-day Agroscope Reckenholz-Tänikon Research Station (ART). However, the second location, Tänikon TG, was only opened in 1970, at that time as a research station for rural economics and agricultural engineering.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Popp, Hans 2001:4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, the vines of West Switzerland were devastated by disease. This marked the establishment of the Vaud Vine Research Station in 1886 and ultimately also the Swiss Federal Research Station in Changins, which resulted from the amalgamation of the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agricultural Chemistry (founded in 1886), the Swiss Federal Seed Control Laboratory (founded in 1898) and the Swiss Federal Vine Research Station (founded in 1915). The Experimental Station for Fruit Production, Viticulture and Horticulture in Wädenswil had already existed since 1890. The Federal Government took over this station in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Popp, Hans 2001:4-5&lt;/ref&gt;  These two locations, Changins and Wädenswil, merged more than a hundred years later to form the Agroscope Changins-Wädenswil Research Station (ACW).

At the end of the 19th century the Federal Government built a new experimental station, including a vegetation building and an experimental cheese dairy, in Liebefeld, Bern. The buildings became operational in 1901. Liebefeld thus became the location for the following three stations: the "Experimental Station for Agricultural Chemistry", the "Swiss Dairy Farming Experimental Station" and the estate farm for permits for the sale of agricultural supplies with head office.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Popp, Hans 2001:4-5&lt;/ref&gt; This head office of the Swiss agricultural experimental and test stations resulted in the Farm Animal Research Station. It moved its location to Posieux FR in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Sieber, Robert; Rüegg, Max 2002:5&lt;/ref&gt;  The Liebefeld and Posieux locations merged exactly one hundred years after their foundation to form the Agroscope Liebefeld-Posieux Research Station (ALP).

In 1874 the Federal Government decided to build the Federal Foal Centre in Thun for breeding Freiberger stallions. In 1927 ten mares were added, and the foal centre became the Swiss Federal Stud. Since 1998 it has been called the Swiss National Stud. Since 2009 it has belonged to the ALP-Haras unit, together with Agroscope Liebefeld-Posieux (ALP).&lt;ref&gt;cf. Website Agroscope: Gestüt&lt;/ref&gt;

This laid the foundation for Agroscope's present three agricultural research stations.

'''First World War (1914–1918)'''
 
As on 1 August 1914 the First World War broke out, Switzerland was totally unprepared: inadequate food production in their own country and the supplies from the country interrupted. Switzerland imported at that time about 85% of the cereal demand.

These bottlenecks particularly in the food supply during the First World War broke out in agricultural research, big changes. The priorities of research, more and more placed on agriculture and issues of grassland and livestock took place in the background.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:37-39&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Between the World Wars (1919–1938) '''

After the end of World War  people wanted as soon as possible  return to a free market. This had disastrous consequences for agriculture. During the First World War, the prices of agricultural commodities were increased significantly, later collapsed brutally.

The importance of cereal crops for food security had been detected and forget the bad experiences at the beginning of World War II. Thus, the Federal Council tried shortly after the war to domestic cereal production by an import monopoly, combined with the acquisition of the domestic crop at a guaranteed price to support and protect against the fluctuations of the global market.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1920 the two  research stations "Swiss seed Investigation and Research" and "Swiss agricultural chemistry research institution" were combined. As of this date was also the new name: Swiss Federal Agricultural Research Institute Zurich – Oerlikon (ELVA).&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:53&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Second World War (1939–1945)'''
 
In an effort to learn from past mistakes and, if possible not to repeat them, people responded pretty quickly, as the political events of the situation in Europe got worse more and more. In time the war preventions measures were initiated. At the beginning of World War I all wartime measures were taken from case to case out of nothing and had to be put out, one was prepared when the war began in 1939 in various relationships significantly better.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of war, the Laboratory provided primarily in the service of the adaptation and reproduction of the agricultural production. End of September 1943, the federal government acquired the good Reckenholz on the northern border of  Zurich-Affoltern.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:70-71&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-war years and the impact of the growing battle (1946–1960)'''

Thanks to the American Marshall Plan enormous sums of money flowed into the western Europe. This allowed the so-called "post-war economic miracle." The two to three decades after the  war are known as an increasing time of euphoria and increased modernization.  Agriculture also was included in an unprecedented structural change, her face changed dramatically.

In 1947, the force during the war price controls lifted and the free competition replaced the official price control again.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:83-85&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Time since 1960'''
 
The Farm Act of 1951 underlined the idea that you can avoid by a generous promotion of agriculture, the overproduction of meat and milk,  but proved to be deceptive. The situation, particularly in the dairy industry, coined the debates and actions of the agricultural policy in those years. In the European Community (EC) was the overproduction a big problem.

During this period, they put the focus of research attention to the development of friendly production methods and improving the quality of the crop.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:101-102&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New concepts in agricultural politics (since 1996)'''

The major problems with the current agricultural policy and the changing values of society in terms of environmental awareness and quality of life called urgently for new approaches in the agricultural policy. On 1 January 1 1999, the new farm bill with the main objectives "more market, more ecology” was put into force. It had become clear that the company long term  was only an environmentally friendly, animal-friendly and tolerant of sustainability-oriented mode of production. The target was clear: a comprehensive, environmentally sound and resource efficient land management, which complies with the care and preservation of our cultural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

A milestone to this is the so-called Integrated Production (IP). On the basis of different research and development projects at the Agroscope Changins-Wädenswil Research Station ACW in the Seventies and Sixties the Integrated Plant Protection – and further on the Integrated Production for Switzerland – was introduced, taking into account integrated pest control. Today, IP in Switzerland equals very often the production after the so-called ÖLN (“ecological performance record”) or SUISSE GARANTIE.

Regarding to a constantly growing world population and a threatening climate change the agricultural research has big challenges to overcome. The Agroscope research for agriculture, nutrition and environment is therefore an investment into our future.

== Famous People ==
'''Jakob Gujer (1716–1785)'''

A simple farmer who came as Kleinjogg from Kazereutihoff to great fame, and so was he probably the most famous Swiss farmer. {{ill|Jakob Gujer|de}} alias "Chlyjogg" became famous by the Zurich city doctor Hans Caspar Hirzel, who published, in 1761, a small book called the "Economy of a peasant philosopher". Chlyjogg was born in 1716 in Wermatswil, where inherited a farm, that managed with great success by new methods devised by him. 1769 he took over the domain “Katzenrütti” near the Reckenholz yards. 
The farm consisted of approximately 68 acres and meadows . Chlyjogg continued testing the methods invented in Wermatswil. 
He tested the application of gypsum and began to stall-feeding, to get more manure. Many important personalities such as Goethe and Duke Karl August of Weimar, visited the Katzenrüttihof. Other famous contemporaries such as Rousseau and Pestalozzi have acknowledged the successful of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler (1842–1935)'''

*Founder of the first Swiss seed and Laboratory Investigation
[[Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler]] was born on 11 August in Safnern, in the Bernese Seeland, as the son of a farmer. In 1870 he joined the agricultural school Rütti. In 1875, he graduated as Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Leipzig. Later he founded a private seed control station in the Mattenhof in Bern. In 1876, he moved to Zurich in order to habilitated in the agricultural department of the Polytechnic. Under Stebler leadership, the seed control station also developed for the international seed trade recognized as a leading institution. 1889 to 1916 he headed the editorial board of the Swiss agricultural newspaper "The Green". On June 3, 1903, he was made an honorary member of the Highland Agricultural Society of Scotland in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst August Grete (1848–1919)'''

*Member of the Board of Directors of the first Swiss agricultural chemistry research station
Ernst August Grete was born 29 September 1848 in Celle (Hannover). He devoted himself to the university in Göttingen to the study of classical philology and later moved into the educational seminar. After his philological studies, he joined the scientific side. In 1878 he was manager of the chemical test station at the agricultural department of the Federal Polytechnic in Zurich. There he worked for more than 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:35&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermann Müller-Thurgau (1850–1927)'''

*The first director of Wädenswil and father of the world's first scientifically-based new vine breed
[[Hermann Müller (Thurgau)|Hermann Müller]] was born in Tägerwilen on Lake Constance. He studied natural sciences at ETH Zurich. In 1874 he was awarded a PhD in Würzburg, Germany, and later became director of the Institute for Plant Physiology at the Geisenheim Research Station, Germany. In 1890 he became the first director of Wädenswil, the present-day Agroscope Changins-Wädenswil Research Station (ACW), and was a pioneer in the field of vine cultivation. He is considered the father of the Müller-Thurgau vine, which was crossed in 1882 and is the world's first scientifically-based new vine breed. With its success it displaced the old varieties, such as Elbling and Räuschling, and up until today has remained the most successful specifically cultivated vine variety: More than 41,000 ha are cultivated worldwide, which corresponds to almost three times the total vine area of Switzerland. It is most widespread in Germany; in German-speaking Switzerland it is still the most important white wine variety today. For a long time this vine variety was thought to be a crossing between Riesling and Silvaner. In 1998 an Austrian research team discovered, on the basis of molecular-genetic tests, that the crossing partners were not Riesling x Silvaner, but Riesling x Madeleine Royal. How this «mix-up» could have occurred has never been discovered. However, this fact has given new impetus to the vine variety's second name, Müller-Thurgau.

'''Albert Volkart (1873–1951)'''

*First Director of the Swiss agricultural experimental station Zurich-Oerlikon
*The great pioneer of Swiss agriculture {{ill|Albert Volkart|de}} , was born in 1873 in Zurich. In 1891 he began his studies at the agricultural department of the Polytechnic in Zurich. After the final examination in 1894, he joined as an assistant to Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler in this institution, where he was later an assistant and management board, where he worked for 35 years. Volkart dealt extensively with issues of plant protection. In 1917, Volkart replaced the retired CEO of Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler seeds Investigation and Research, and three years later, he became head of the Swiss agricultural experimental station Zurich-Oerlikon. In 1925 he became professor of Agronomy at the ETH.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Traugott Wahlen (1899–1985)'''

*Director of the Federal Agricultural Research Institute Zurich-Oerlikon
[[Friedrich Traugott Wahlen]] was born in 1899 in Gmeis Mirchel in the Emmental. As a small child he wanted to be a farmer. In 1917 he began his study of agriculture at the Polytechnic in Zurich. He acted in several roles:

**1929-1943: Executive Board of the Swiss agricultural experimental station Zurich-Oerlikon
**1938-1945: Member in the Federal War Food Office
**1942-1949: Council of the Canton of Zurich
**1943-1949: Professor of Agronomy at the agricultural department of the ETH

In 1949 he was appointed to the FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization), first to Washington and then in 1951, to Rome, where he presided as director of the Department of Agriculture from 1950 to 1952 and  was chief of the technical assistance program. In 1958 he was appointed Deputy Director-General of  the FAO. On 11 December 1958, the Federal Assembly elected him to the Federal Council, where he first  was the Minister of Justice and Police, later he led the Ministry of the Department of Economic and then was the Foreign Minister by the Political Department. Until the 1965 elections  he was a Federal Council.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:62-63&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolf Koblet (1904–1983)'''

*Executive Board of the Swiss Federal Agricultural Research Institute Zurich-Oerlikon
*A polymath of the agricultural crop
On 13 February 1904 {{ill|Rudolf Koblet|de}} was born in Heiterthal, not far from Kollbrunn in Tösstal. He attended the Industrial School in Winterthur and in 1923 began with his studies at the Department of Agriculture of the ETH. In 1926 he graduated with a diploma as an engineer-agronomist. After a stay in France he went to Canada where he acquired, besides the work as "farm help" in various Canadian farms,  specialized knowledge, as a volunteer in the Seed Branch in Ottawa, in the field of control seeds. In 1929 he joined the line for seed control in Oerlikon. With his work "On the germination Pinus strobus with particular reference to the origin of the seed," he earned his doctorate in 1932 Dr.sc.techn. ETH.  In 1949 he became head of the Department of Agronomy at the ETH.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolf Salzmann (1912–1992)'''

*Director of the Swiss Federal Agricultural Research Station for Agronomy Zurich- Reckenholz
*Planner and builder of the Research Institute Reckenholz
{{ill|Rudolf Salzmann|de}} was born on 2 January 1912 in Bern. In the years 1930 to 1933, he completed his agriculture studies at the ETH. He oversaw the procurement of seed in the war food office under Frederick Traugott elections and then took a slightly later point in agricultural chemistry from the Swiss Federal Institute Liebefeld, where he worked on the agronomic aspects and problems of the institution. In 1944, he was transferred to the agricultural experimental station Oerlikon. His election as successor to Director Koblet took place on November 1, 195, when he took responsibility for both academic work and for the organizational and administrative issues.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bachelor of Music''' is an [[academic degree]] awarded by a [[college]], [[university]], or [[music school|conservatory]] upon completion of a program of study in [[music]]. In the United States, it is a [[professional degree]], and the majority of work consists of prescribed music courses and study in applied music, usually requiring proficiency in an instrument, voice, or conducting. In Canada, the B.M. is often considered an [[undergraduate]] degree. Programs typically last from three to four and a half years.

The degree may be awarded for [[performance]], [[music education]], [[musical composition|composition]], [[music theory]], [[musicology]] / [[music history]] (musicology degrees may be a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) rather than a B.M.) [[music technology]], [[music therapy]], sacred music, music business/[[music industry]], entertainment, [[music production (music industry)|music production]] or [[jazz]] studies. In the 2010s, some universities have begun offering degrees in Music Composition with Technology, which include traditional theory and musicology courses and [[sound recording]] and composition courses using digital technologies.

In the United Kingdom, the Bachelor of Music is generally a [[undergraduate degree|first degree]] lasting three years (or four years in Scotland) and consisting of a wide range of areas of study (normally including performance, composition, music theory, musicology/music history), but at the [[University of Oxford]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/14-33_General_Regulations.shtml Regulations for the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Music] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019042411/http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/14-33_General_Regulations.shtml |date=2008-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/guide/summary/mus.html Bachelor of Music (MusB)]&lt;/ref&gt; it is a one-year [[postgraduate]] degree which can only be taken if a student is a graduate in music with [[Honors degree|honors]] at those universities; the undergraduate course is in the [[Faculty of Arts]] and leads to the Bachelor of Arts (and subsequently the [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)]]).

==Abbreviations==
After a degree holder's name, as on a [[business card]] or a [[Curriculum vitae|CV]], the degree is abbreviated in various ways, including: B.M., BM, B.Mus, BMus, Mus.B, or Mus.Bac. Some recipients add an abbreviation for the name of the institution which granted the degree as well, e.g., "Susan Bhattara, B.Mus. (Oxon)"; ''Oxon'' being the Latin abbreviation for [[Oxford University]].

==Post-graduation options==
Graduates may apply for jobs in performance, teaching, or [[arts administration]]. As well, graduates can apply for jobs which require a bachelor's degree in every subject, such as some entry-level jobs in banking, insurance, sales, and administration. Graduates with an interest in teaching in the school system may go on to complete a [[teaching degree]] or diploma. Graduates who have achieved a high standard on their instrument, voice, or another specialization such as composition or conducting may be eligible to apply for a [[Master of Music]] (M.M.) if their grades are high enough (a B+ or A- average is typically required). B.M. graduates can also apply to a range of graduate programs outside of music, such as library science, [[business administration]] or [[public administration]]; a B+ or A- average is typically required. Some programs may require B.M. graduates to complete preparatory or make-up courses in the field of the master's. As well, some programs require the [[GRE]] or [[GMAT]] (standardized tests). B.M. graduates in some fields, such as composition, music theory, or musicology may be able to apply directly to [[Ph.D]] programs if they have a high average and strong recommendation letters.

'''''Before Jerusalem Fell''''' is a book written by [[Kenneth Gentry]] based on his [[PhD]] dissertation from [[Whitefield Theological Seminary]]. The book is currently in its third edition and is published by [[American Vision]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

The book presents a sustained argument from fields such as [[biblical hermeneutics]], ancient history, [[textual criticism]], [[archaeology]], and [[Christian theology]] for why the [[Book of Revelation]] must have been written before the [[destruction of Jerusalem]] in AD 70, during the reign of Roman emperor [[Nero]]. Gentry argues that Nero Caesar is the "sixth king" presently ruling ({{bibleverse||Rev.|17:10}}) who functions in Revelation as the [[The Beast (Bible)|Beast]].

The book is controversial in that it goes against majority [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[Dispensation (period)|Dispensational]] opinion that Revelation was written in the reign of [[Domitian]] in AD 95, though the pre-AD 70 date for Revelation was the dominant view of scholars in the 19th century and first two decades of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8683">[[File:J0737-3039 still1 large.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a binary pulsar]]
A '''binary pulsar''' is a [[pulsar]] with a [[binary star|binary companion]], often a [[white dwarf]] or [[neutron star]]. (In at least one case, the double pulsar [[PSR J0737-3039]], the companion neutron star is another pulsar as well.)  Binary pulsars are one of the few objects which allow physicists to test [[general relativity]] because of the strong gravitational fields in their vicinities. Although the binary companion to the pulsar is usually difficult or impossible to observe directly, its presence can be deduced from the timing of the pulses from the pulsar itself, which can be measured with extraordinary accuracy by [[radio telescope]]s.

==History==
The first binary pulsar, [[PSR B1913+16]] or the "Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar" was discovered in 1974 at [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] by [[Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr.]] and [[Russell Hulse]], for which they won the 1993 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. While Hulse was observing the newly discovered pulsar PSR B1913+16, he noticed that the rate at which it pulsed varied regularly. It was concluded  that the pulsar was orbiting another star very closely at a high velocity, and that the pulse period was varying due to the Doppler effect: As the pulsar was moving towards Earth, the pulses would be more frequent; and  conversely, as it moved away from Earth fewer would be detected in a given time period. One can think of the pulses like the ticks of a clock; changes in the ticking are indications of changes in the pulsars speed toward and away from Earth. Hulse and Taylor also determined that the stars were approximately equally massive by observing these pulse fluctuations, which led them to believe the other  object was also a neutron star. Pulses from this system are now tracked to within 15 [[microsecond|μs]].&lt;ref name="wet2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Weisberg | first= J. M. | year=  2010| title=Timing Measurements of the Relativistic Binary Pulsar PSR B1913+16 | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume = 722 |  pages=1030–1034 | doi=10.1088/0004-637X/722/2/1030 | arxiv =  1011.0718v1 | bibcode=2010ApJ...722.1030W
 | last3 = Taylor | first3 = J. H. | last2 = Nice | first2 = D. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the PSR B1913+16 binary pulsar also led to the first accurate determination of neutron star masses, using relativistic timing effects.&lt;ref name="wt82"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = J. H. |last2=Weisberg | first2= J. M. | year=  1982| title=A new test of general relativity - Gravitational radiation and the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16 | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume = 253 |  pages=908–920 | doi=10.1086/159690 | bibcode=1982ApJ...253..908T }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the two bodies are in close proximity, the gravitational field is stronger, the passage of time is slowed – and the time between pulses (or ticks) is lengthened. Then as the pulsar clock travels more slowly through the weakest part of the field it regains time. A special relativistic effect, time dilation, acts around the orbit in a similar fashion.  This relativistic time delay is the difference between what one would expect to see if the pulsar were moving at a constant distance and speed around its companion in a circular orbit, and what is actually observed.

Prior to [[First observation of gravitational waves|2015]] and the operation of [[LIGO|Advanced LIGO]],&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211"&gt;{{cite journal | collaboration = LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration | last1 = Abbott | first1 = Benjamin P.  |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 |journal=[[Phys.

A  10-parameter model incorporating information about the pulsar timing, the [[Kepler's laws|Keplerian]] orbits and three post-Keplerian corrections (the rate of [[periastron]] advance,  a factor for [[gravitational redshift]] and [[time dilation]], and a rate of change of the orbital period from [[gravitational radiation]] emission) is sufficient to completely model the binary pulsar timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Weisberg | first= J. M. | date=  October 1981| title=Gravitational waves from an orbiting pulsar | journal=Scientific American | volume = 245 |  pages=74–82 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1081-74 | bibcode=1981SciAm.245d..74W |  last2 = Taylor | first2 = J. H. | last3 = Fowler | first3 = L. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haynes2007"&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/psr1913.htm | title=Prof. Martha Haynes Astro 201 Binary Pulsar PSR 1913+16 Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measurements made of the orbital decay of the PSR B1913+16 system were a near perfect match to Einstein's equations. Relativity predicts that over time a binary system's orbital energy will be converted to [[gravitational radiation]]. Data collected by Taylor and Joel M. Weisberg and their colleagues of the orbital period of PSR B1913+16 supported this relativistic prediction; they reported in 1982&lt;ref name="wt82"/&gt; and subsequently&lt;ref name="wet2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = J. H. | last2=Weisberg | first2= J. M. | year=  1989| title=Further experimental tests of relativistic gravity using the binary pulsar PSR 1913 + 16 | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume = 345 |  pages=434–450 | doi=10.1086/167917 | bibcode=1989ApJ...345..434T }}&lt;/ref&gt; that there was a difference in the observed minimum separation of the two pulsars compared to that expected if the orbital separation had remained constant. In the decade following its discovery the system's orbital period had decreased by about 76 millionths of a second per year - this means that the pulsar was approaching its maximum separation more than a second earlier than it would have if the orbit had remained the same. Subsequent observations continue to show this decrease.

==Effects==
Sometimes the relatively normal companion star of a binary pulsar will swell up to the point that it dumps its outer layers onto the pulsar. This interaction can heat the gas being exchanged between the bodies and produce X-ray light which can appear to pulsate, in a process called the [[X-ray binary]] stage. The flow of matter from one stellar body to another often leads to the creation of an [[accretion disk]] about the recipient star.

[[Pulsar]]s also create a  "wind" of relativistically outflowing particles, which in the case of binary pulsars can blow away the [[magnetosphere]] of their companions and have a dramatic effect on the pulse emission.

{{Redirect|Brackish|the Kittie song|Brackish (song)}}
{{Water salinity}}
'''Brackish water''' is water that has more [[salt]]  than [[freshwater]], but not as much as [[seawater]]. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in [[estuary|estuaries]], or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root "[[:wikt:brak#Dutch|brak]]". Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the [[Osmotic power|salinity gradient power]] process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on [[shrimp farms]]).

Technically, brackish water contains between 0.5 and 30&amp;nbsp;grams of [[salt]] per litre—more often expressed as 0.5 to 30 [[parts per thousand]] (‰), which is a [[specific gravity]] of between 1.005 and 1.010. Thus, ''brackish'' covers a range of [[Salinity#Systems of classification of water bodies based upon salinity|salinity regimes]] and is not considered a precisely defined condition. It is characteristic of many brackish surface waters that their salinity can vary considerably over space or time.

== Brackish water habitats ==

=== Estuaries ===
[[File:Monodactylus argenteus.JPG|thumb|A brackish water fish: ''[[Silver moony|Monodactylus argenteus]]'']]

Brackish water condition commonly occurs when fresh water meets seawater. In fact, the most extensive brackish water habitats worldwide are [[estuary|estuaries]], where a river meets the sea.

The [[River Thames]] flowing through [[London]] is a classic river estuary. The town of [[Teddington]] a few miles west of London marks the boundary between the tidal and non-tidal parts of the Thames, although it is still considered a freshwater river about as far east as [[Battersea]] insofar as the average salinity is very low and the fish fauna consists predominantly of freshwater species such as [[Rutilus|roach]], [[Common dace|dace]], [[carp]], [[perch]], and [[pike (fish)|pike]]. The [[Thames Estuary]] becomes brackish between Battersea and [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], and the diversity of freshwater fish species present is smaller, primarily roach and dace; [[euryhaline]] marine species such as [[flounder]], [[European seabass]], [[mullet (fish)|mullet]], and [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]] become much more common. Further east, the salinity increases and the freshwater fish species are completely replaced by euryhaline marine ones, until the river reaches Gravesend, at which point conditions become fully marine and the fish fauna resembles that of the adjacent [[North Sea]] and includes both euryhaline and [[stenohaline]] marine species. A similar pattern of replacement can be observed with the aquatic plants and invertebrates living in the river.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/thames.htm The River Thames – its geology, geography and vital statistics from source to sea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516000937/http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/thames.htm |date=2010-05-16 }}, The-River-Thames.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/wildlife.htm The River Thames – its natural history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818220921/http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/wildlife.htm |date=2006-08-18 }} The-River-Thames.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of [[ecological succession]] from a freshwater to marine [[ecosystem]] is typical of river estuaries. River estuaries form important staging points during the migration of [[Fish migration|anadromous and catadromous]] fish species, such as [[salmon]], [[American shad|shad]], and [[eel]]s, giving them time to form social groups and to adjust to the changes in salinity. Salmon are anadromous, meaning they live in the sea but ascend rivers to spawn; eels are catadromous, living in rivers and streams, but returning to the sea to breed. Besides the species that migrate through estuaries, there are many other fish that use them as "nursery grounds" for spawning or as places young fish can feed and grow before moving elsewhere. [[Herring]] and [[plaice]] are two commercially important species that use the Thames Estuary for this purpose.

Estuaries are also commonly used as fishing grounds, and as places for fish farming or ranching.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eattilapia.com/tilapia-farming.php  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929170847/http://www.eattilapia.com/tilapia-farming.php |date=September 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Atlantic salmon]] farms are often located in estuaries, although this has caused controversy, because in doing so, fish farmers expose migrating wild fish to large numbers of external [[parasitism|parasites]] such as [[sea lice]] that escape from the pens the farmed fish are kept in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saveourseatrout.com/|title=脱毛の口コミまとめ|work=saveourseatrout.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717032912/http://www.saveourseatrout.com/|archivedate=2006-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mangroves ===
Another important brackish water habitat is the [[mangrove swamp]] or '''mangal'''. Many, though not all, mangrove swamps fringe estuaries and lagoons where the salinity changes with each tide. Among the most specialised residents of mangrove forests are [[mudskippers]], fish that forage for food on land, and [[archer fish]], perch-like fish that "spit" at insects and other small animals living in the trees, knocking them into the water where they can be eaten. Like estuaries, mangrove swamps are extremely important breeding grounds for many fish, with species such as [[Lutjanidae|snappers]], [[halfbeak]]s, and [[tarpon]] spawning or maturing among them. Besides fish, numerous other animals use mangroves, including such species as the  [[saltwater crocodile]], [[American crocodile]], [[proboscis monkey]], [[diamondback terrapin]], and the [[Crab-eating Frog|crab-eating frog]], ''Fejervarya cancrivora'' (formerly ''Rana cancrivora''). Mangroves represent important nesting site for numerous birds groups such as herons, storks, spoonbills, ibises, kingfishers, shorebirds and seabirds.

Although often plagued with [[mosquito]]es and other insects that make them unpleasant for humans, mangrove swamps are very important buffer zones between land and sea, and are a natural defense against hurricane and tsunami damage in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=1823&amp;language=1 Mangrove forests 'can reduce impact of tsunamis'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618043027/http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readnews&amp;itemid=1823&amp;language=1 |date=2006-06-18 }}, Science and Development Network, December 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sundarbans]] and [[Bhitarkanika Mangroves]] are two of the large mangrove forests in the world, both on the coast of the [[Bay of Bengal]].

=== Brackish seas and lakes ===
Some seas and lakes are brackish. The [[Baltic Sea]] is a brackish sea adjoining the [[North Sea]]. Originally the [[confluence]] of [[Eridanos (geology)|two major river systems]] prior to the [[Pleistocene]], since then it has been flooded by the North Sea but still receives so much freshwater from the adjacent lands that the water is brackish. Because the salt water coming in from the sea is denser than freshwater, the water in the Baltic is stratified, with salt water at the bottom and freshwater at the top. Limited mixing occurs because of the lack of tides and storms, with the result that the fish fauna at the surface is freshwater in composition while that lower down is more marine. [[Cod]] are an example of a species only found in deep water in the Baltic, while [[Northern pike|pike]] are confined to the less [[saline water|saline]] surface waters.

The [[Caspian Sea]] is the world's largest lake and contains brackish water with a salinity about one-third that of normal [[seawater]]. The Caspian is famous for its peculiar animal fauna, including one of the few non-marine seals (the [[Caspian seal]]) and the great [[sturgeon]]s, a major source of [[caviar]].

The [[Hudson Bay]] is a brackish [[marginal sea]] of the [[arctic ocean]], it remains brackish due its limited connections to the open ocean, very high levels freshwater [[surface runoff]] input from the large [[Hudson Bay drainage basin]], and low rate of evaporation due to being completely covered in ice for over half the year.

In the [[Black Sea]] the surface water is brackish with an average salinity of about 17-18 parts per thousand compared to 30 to 40 for the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Lüning, K., Yarish, C. &amp; Kirkman, H. ''Seaweeds: their environment, biogeography, and ecophysiology.'' Wiley-IEEE, 1990. p. 121. {{ISBN|978-0-471-62434-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deep, [[anoxic event|anoxic]] water of the Black Sea originates from warm, salty water of the [[Mediterranean]].

'''Bularchus''' was an [[Ancient Greek]] painter; Pliny indicates that he was working in the 8th century BC, during the reign of [[Candaules]], King of [[Lydia]].&lt;ref name=bryan/&gt;

==Life==
Bularchus' '' Battle of the Magnesians'', is the earliest picture of which the ancient writers have left a description. The artist appears to have flourished in the late 8th century BC, as, according to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], this picture was purchased for as much gold as would cover its surface by [[Candaules]], King of [[Lydia]], who died in about [[700 B.C.]]&lt;ref name=bryan/&gt;

After Bularchus we encounter a gap of upwards of two centuries and a half in the history of Greek painting. It appears, however, that it was practised on the island of [[Rhodes]], at the time of [[Anacreon]], who lived about 600 years before Christ. That poet, in his twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth [[Ode]]s, mentions the practice of  [[encaustic painting]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13056">'''Chronological dating''', or simply '''dating''', is the process of attributing to an object or event a date in the past, allowing such object or event to be located in a previously established [[chronology]]. This usually requires what is commonly known as a "dating method". Several dating methods exist, depending on different criteria and techniques, and some very well known examples of disciplines using such techniques are, for example, [[history]], [[archaeology]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]], [[astronomy]] and even [[forensic science]], since in the latter it is sometimes necessary to investigate the moment in the past in which the death of a [[cadaver]] occurred.

== Dating methods ==

Dating methods are most commonly classified following two criteria: [[relative dating]] and [[absolute dating]].

=== Relative dating ===
{{Main article|Relative dating}}
[[Relative dating]] methods are unable to determine the absolute age of an object or event, but can determine the impossibility of a particular event happening before or after another event of which the absolute date is well known. In this relative dating method, [[Latin]] terms ''[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]'' and ''[[Terminus post quem|post quem]]'' are usually used to indicate both the oldest and the most recent possible moments when an event occurred or an artifact was left in a [[stratum]]. But this method is also useful in many other disciplines. Historians, for example, know that Shakespeare's play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' was not written before 1587 because Shakespeare's primary source for writing his play was the second edition of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles'', not published until 1587.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, Clayton A. "Shakespeare's Use of The Famous Victories of Henry V," Notes &amp; Queries. n. s. 1 (June, 1954): 238-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, 1587 is the ''post quem'' dating of Shakespeare's play ''Henry V''. That means that the play was without fail written after (in Latin, ''post'') 1587.

The same inductive mechanism is applied in archaeology, geology and paleontology, by many ways. For example, in a stratum presenting difficulties or ambiguities to absolute dating, [[paleopalynology]] can be used as a relative referent by means of the study of the pollens found in the stratum. This is admitted because of the simple reason that some botanical species, whether extinct or not, are well known as belonging to a determined position in the scale of time.

For a non-exhaustive list of relative dating methods and relative dating applications used in geology, paleontology or archaeology, see the following:

* [[Cross-cutting relationships]]
* [[Harris matrix]]
* [[Law of included fragments]]
* [[Law of superposition]]
* [[Principle of original horizontality]]
* [[Principle of lateral continuity]]
* [[Principle of faunal succession]]
* [[Melt inclusions]]
* [[Nitrogen dating]]
* [[Fluorine absorption dating]]
* [[Seriation (archaeology)]]
* [[Sequence dating]] (a type of seriation)
* [[Palynology]] (the study of modern-dated pollens for the relative dating of archaeological strata, also used in [[forensic palynology]])
* [[Paleopalynology]] (also spelt "Palaeopalynology", the study of fossilized pollens for the relative dating of geological strata)
* [[Morphology (archaeology)]]
* [[Typology (archaeology)]]
* [[Varnish microlamination]]
* [[Vole clock]]
* Lead corrosion dating&lt;ref&gt;Chemistry Professor Shimon Reich, a specialist in [[superconductivity]], has demonstrated a method for dating artifacts based on the magnetic properties of [[lead]], a material widely used in Israel and elsewhere in antiquity.  Reich and coworkers found that at cryogenic temperatures, lead becomes a superconductor, but the corrosion products formed from centuries of exposure to air and water ([[lead oxide]] and [[lead carbonate]]) do not superconduct.  On the basis of magnetic measurements and comparison with artifacts that were known (using other techniques) to be up to 2500 years old, the group showed that the mass of lead corrosion products is directly proportional to an object's age (New Journal of Physics, 2003, 5, 99)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Jacoby, "[https://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/85/8510cover.html Chemistry in the Holy Land]", ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News'', 5 March 2007, page 20, published by American Chemical Society&lt;/ref&gt; (exclusively used in archaeology)
* [[Paleomagnetism]]
* [[Tephrochronology]]
* [[Marine isotope stage]]s based on the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]

=== Absolute dating ===
{{Main article|Absolute dating}}
[[Absolute dating]] methods, by using absolute referent criteria, mainly include the [[radiometric dating]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=radioactive dating|file=R05082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of both radiometric and non-radiometric absolute dating methods are the following:

== Dating methods in archaeology ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dating methodologies in archaeology]] --&gt;
Same as [[Geology|geologists]] or [[paleontology|paleontologists]], [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] are also brought to determine the age of ancient materials, but in their case, the areas of their studies are restricted to the history of both ancient and recent humans. Thus, to be considered as archaeological, the remains, objects or artifacts to be dated must be related to human activity. It is commonly assumed that if the remains or elements to be dated are older than the human species, the disciplines which study them are sciences such geology or paleontology, among some others.

Nevertheless, the range of time within archaeological dating can be enormous compared to the average lifespan of a singular human being. As an example [[Pinnacle Point]]'s caves, in the southern coast of [[South Africa]], provided evidence that marine resources (shellfish) have been regularly exploited by humans as of 170,000 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} On the other hand, remains as recent as a hundred years old can also be the target of archaeological dating methods. It was the case of an [[18th century|18th-century]] [[sloop]] whose [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] was led in [[South Carolina]] ([[United States]]) in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nauticalarch.org/projects/clydesdale-plantation-18th-century-sloop-excavation/ Clydesdale Plantation 18th-Century Sloop Excavation]", [[Institute of Nautical Archaeology]], Texas, USA&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from the oldest to the youngest, all [[archaeological site]]s are likely to be dated by an appropriate method.

Dating material drawn from the [[archaeological record]] can be made by a direct study of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], or may be deduced by [[Archaeological association|association]] with materials found in the [[archaeological context|context]] the item is drawn from or inferred by its point of discovery in the [[Sequence (archaeological)|sequence]] relative to datable contexts. Dating is carried out mainly [[post excavation]], but to support good practice, some preliminary dating work called "spot dating" is usually run in tandem with [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]. Dating is very important in archaeology for constructing models of the past, as it relies on the integrity of dateable objects and samples. Many disciplines of [[archaeological science]] are concerned with dating evidence, but in practice several different dating techniques must be applied in some circumstances, thus dating evidence for much of an archaeological sequence recorded during excavation requires matching information from known absolute or some associated steps, with a careful study of [[Relationship (archaeology)|stratigraphic relationships]].

In addition, because of its particular relation with past human presence or past human activity, archaeology uses almost all the dating methods that it shares with the other sciences, but with some particular variations, like the following:

===Written markers===
* [[Epigraphy]] – analysis of inscriptions, via identifying graphemes, clarifying their meanings, classifying their uses according to dates and cultural contexts, and drawing conclusions about the writing and the writers.
* [[Numismatics]] – many coins have the date of their production written on them or their use is specified in the historical record.
* [[Palaeography]] – the study of ancient writing, including the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts.

=== Seriation ===
[[Seriation (archaeology)|Seriation]] is a relative dating method (see, above, the list of relative dating methods). An example of a practical application of seriation, is the comparison of the known [[Style (visual arts)#Style in archaeology|style]] of artifacts such as [[stone tool]]s or pottery.

===Age-equivalent stratigraphic markers===
* [[Paleomagnetism]] (a relative dating method, see the corresponding list above)
* [[Marine isotope stage]]s based on the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]] (a relative dating method, see the corresponding list above)
* [[Tephrochronology]] (an absolute dating method, see the corresponding list above)

=== Stratigraphic relationships ===

The [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphy]] of an archaeological site can be used to date, or refine the date, of particular activities ("contexts") on that site. For example, if a context is sealed between two other contexts of known date, it can be inferred that the middle context must date to between those dates.

'''Criticism of technology''' is an analysis of adverse impacts of industrial and [[Digital technology|digital]] technologies. It is argued that, in all advanced industrial societies (not necessarily only capitalist ones), technology becomes a means of domination, control, and exploitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History and Philosophy of Science and Technology|last=Lorenzano|first=Pablo|authorlink2=Hans-Jörg Rheinberger|last2=Rheinberger|first2=Hans-Jörg|last3=Ortiz|first3=Eduardo|last4=Galles|first4=Carlos|publisher=EOLSS Publishers Co. Ltd.|year=2010|isbn=9781848267763|location=Oxford|pages=124-125}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more generally something which threatens the survival of humanity.  Some of the technology opposed by critics includes everyday household products, such as [[Refrigerator|refrigerators]], [[Home computer|computers]], and [[medication]].&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis"&gt;[[Chellis Glendinning|Glendinning, Chellis]]. ''[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/chellis-glendinning-notes-toward-a-neo-luddite-manifesto Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto]''. Utne Reader, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Prominent authors elaborating a critique of technology include [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Ivan Illich]], [[Langdon Winner]], [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Günther Anders]], [[Neil Postman]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], [[Mike Cooley (engineer) | Mike Cooley]] and [[Lewis Mumford]]. Some authors such as [[Chellis Glendinning]] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] consider themselves [[Neo-Luddism|Neo-Luddites]] and hold that technological progress has had a negative impact on humanity. Their work focused on seeking meaning out of technological change, specifically wrestling with the question of "how tools and their affordances change and alter the fabric of everyday life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/constructive_technology_criticism.php/|title=Toward a Constructive Technology Criticism|last=Watson|first=Sara|date=October 2016|work=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellul, for instance, maintained that when people assert that technology is an instrument of freedom or the means to achieve historical destiny or the execution of divine vocation, it results in the glorification and sanctification of Technique so that it becomes that which gives meaning and value to life rather than mere ensemble of materials.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jacques Ellul and the Technological Society in the 21st Century|last=Jeronimo|first=Helena|last2=Garcia|first2=Jose|last3=Mitcham|first3=Carl|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2013|isbn=9789400766570|location=Dordrecht|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is echoed by [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]] critics who cite the way technological discourse damages institutions and individuals who make up those institutions due to its idealization and capacity to define [[Hierarchy|social hierarchies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition: Communication from Ancient Times to the Information Age|last=Enos|first=Theresa|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=0824072006|location=New York|pages=619}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In its most extreme, criticisms of technology produce analyses of technology as potentially leading to catastrophe. For instance, activist [[Naomi Klein]] described how technology is employed by capitalism in its commitment to a "shock doctrine", which promotes a series of crises so that speculative profit can be accumulated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are theorists who also cite the cases of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crises]] as well as the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] disasters to support their critique.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critiques also focus on specific issues such as how technology - through [[robotics]], [[automation]], and [[software]] - is destroying people's jobs faster than it is creating them, contributing to the incidence of poverty and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/|title=How Technology Is Destroying Jobs|last=Rotman|first=David|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 1970s in the US, the critique of technology became the basis of a new political perspective called [[anarcho-primitivism]], which was forwarded by thinkers such as [[Fredy Perlman]], [[John Zerzan]], and [[David Watson (anarchist)|David Watson]]. They proposed differing theories about how it became an industrial society, and not capitalism as such, that was at the root of contemporary social problems. This theory was developed in the journal Fifth Estate in the 1970s and 1980s, and was influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]], the [[Situationist International]], [[Jacques Ellul]] and others.

The critique of technology overlaps with the [[philosophy of technology]] but whereas the latter tries to establish itself as an academic discipline the critique of technology is basically a political project, not limited to [[academia]]. It features prominently in [[neomarxism|neo-Marxist]] ([[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Andrew Feenberg]]), [[ecofeminism]] ([[Vandana Shiva]]) and in [[Postdevelopment Theory|postdevelopment]] ([[Ivan Illich]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10543">'''Database design''' is the organisation of data according to a [[database model]]. The designer determines what data must be stored and how the data elements interrelate. With this information, they can begin to fit the data to the database model.&lt;ref name="Teorey, T.J. 2009"&gt;Teorey, T.J., Lightstone, S.S., et al., (2009). Database Design: Know it all.1st ed. Burlington, MA.: Morgan Kaufmann Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

Database design involves classifying data and identifying interrelationships. This theoretical representation of the data is called an ''[[Ontology (information science)|ontology]]''. The ontology is the theory behind the database's design.

==Determining data to be stored==
In a majority of cases, a person who is doing the design of a database is a person with expertise in the area of database design, rather than expertise in the domain from which the data to be stored is drawn e.g. financial information, biological information etc. Therefore, the data to be stored in the database must be determined in cooperation with a person who does have expertise in that domain, and who is aware of what data must be stored within the system.

This process is one which is generally considered part of [[requirements analysis]], and requires skill on the part of the database designer to elicit the needed information from those with the [[domain knowledge]]. This is because those with the necessary domain knowledge frequently cannot express clearly what their system requirements for the database are as they are unaccustomed to thinking in terms of the discrete data elements which must be stored. Data to be stored can be determined by Requirement Specification.&lt;ref&gt;Teorey, T.; Lightstone, S. and Nadeau, T.(2005) ''Database Modeling &amp; Design: Logical Design'', 4th edition, Morgan Kaufmann Press. {{ISBN|0-12-685352-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determining data relationships==
Once a database designer is aware of the data which is to be stored within the database, they must then determine where dependency is within the data. Sometimes when data is changed you can be changing other data that is not visible. For example, in a list of names and addresses, assuming a situation where multiple people can have the same address, but one person cannot have more than one address, the address is dependent upon the name. When provided a name and the list the address can be uniquely determined; however, the inverse does not hold - when given an address and the list, a name cannot be uniquely determined because multiple people can reside at an address.  Because an address is determined by a name, an address is considered dependent on a name.

(NOTE: A common misconception is that the [[relational model]] is so called because of the stating of relationships between data elements therein. This is not true. The relational model is so named because it is based upon the mathematical structures known as [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]].)

==Logically structuring data==
{{Main|Logical schema}}
Once the relationships and dependencies amongst the various pieces of information have been determined, it is possible to arrange the data into a logical structure which can then be mapped into the storage objects supported by the [[database management system]]. In the case of [[relational databases]] the storage objects are [[database table|tables]] which store data in rows and columns. In an [[Object database]] the storage objects correspond directly to the objects used by the [[Object-oriented programming language]] used to write the applications that will manage and access the data. The relationships may be defined as attributes of the object classes involved or as methods that operate on the object classes.

The way this mapping is generally performed is such that each set of related data which depends upon a single object, whether real or abstract, is placed in a table. Relationships between these dependent objects is then stored as links between the various objects.

Each table may represent an implementation of either a logical object or a relationship joining one or more instances of one or more logical objects. Relationships between tables may then be stored as links connecting child tables with parents. Since complex logical relationships are themselves tables they will probably have links to more than one parent.

==ER diagram (entity-relationship model)==
[[Image:ER Diagram MMORPG.png|thumb|320px|A sample Entity-relationship diagram]]

Database designs also include ER ([[entity-relationship model]]) diagrams. An ER diagram is a diagram that helps to design databases in an efficient way.

Attributes in ER diagrams are usually modeled as an oval with the name of the attribute, linked to the entity or relationship that contains the attribute.

#'''Determine the purpose of the database''' - This helps prepare for the remaining steps.
#'''Find and organize the information required''' - Gather all of the types of information to record in the database, such as product name and order number.
#'''Divide the information into tables''' - Divide information items into major entities or subjects, such as Products or Orders. Each subject then becomes a table.
#'''Turn information items into columns''' - Decide what information needs to be stored in each table. Each item becomes a field, and is displayed as a column in the table. For example, an Employees table might include fields such as Last Name and Hire Date.
#'''Specify primary keys''' - Choose each table’s primary key. The primary key is a column, or a set of columns, that is used to uniquely identify each row. An example might be Product ID or Order ID.
#'''Set up the table relationships''' - Look at each table and decide how the data in one table is related to the data in other tables. Add fields to tables or create new tables to clarify the relationships, as necessary.
#'''Refine the design''' - Analyze the design for errors. Create tables and add a few records of sample data. Check if results come from the tables as expected. Make adjustments to the design, as needed.
#'''Apply the [[Database normalization|normalization rules]]''' - Apply the data normalization rules to see if tables are structured correctly. Make adjustments to the tables, as needed.

==Normalization==
{{main|Database normalization}}
In the field of [[relational database]] design, ''normalization'' is a systematic way of ensuring that a database structure is suitable for general-purpose querying and free of certain undesirable characteristics—insertion, update, and deletion anomalies that could lead to  loss of [[data integrity]].

A standard piece of database design guidance is that the designer should create a fully normalized design; selective [[denormalization]] can subsequently be performed, but only for [[computer performance|performance]] reasons. However, some modeling disciplines, such as the [[dimensional modeling]] approach to [[data warehouse]] design, explicitly recommend non-normalized designs, i.e. designs that in large part do not adhere to 3NF.
Normalization consists of normal forms that are 1NF,2NF,3NF,BOYCE-CODD NF (3.5NF),4NF and 5NF

===Conceptual schema===
{{Main|Conceptual schema}}

===Schema refinement===
Schema refinement of the database specifies that the data is normalized to reduce data insufficiency and conflicts.

===Physical design===
{{Main|Physical schema}}
The physical design of the database specifies the physical configuration of the database on the storage media. This includes detailed specification of [[data element]]s, [[data type]]s, [[Index (database)|indexing]] options and other parameters residing in the DBMS [[data dictionary]]. It is the detailed design of a system that includes modules &amp; the database's hardware &amp; software specifications of the system.

A '''deep foundation''' is a type of [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] that transfers building loads to the earth farther down from the surface than a [[shallow foundation]] does to a subsurface layer or a range of depths.

A '''pile''' or '''piling''' is a vertical structural element of a deep foundation, driven or drilled deep into the ground at the [[building site]].

[[File:The Torch Under Construction on 18 May 2007.jpg|thumb|Deep foundations of [[The Marina Torch]], a skyscraper in [[Dubai]]]]
There are many reasons that a [[geotechnical engineer]] would recommend a deep foundation over a [[shallow foundation]], such as for a [[skyscraper]]. Some of the common reasons are very large design loads, a poor [[soil]] at shallow depth, or site constraints like [[property line]]s. There are different terms used to describe different types of deep foundations including the pile (which is analogous to a [[:wikt:pole|pole]]), the pier (which is analogous to a [[column]]), drilled shafts, and [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]]s. Piles are generally driven into the ground [[in situ]]; other deep foundations are typically put in place using excavation and drilling. The naming conventions may vary between engineering disciplines and firms. Deep foundations can be made out of [[timber]], [[steel]], [[reinforced concrete]] or [[prestressed concrete]].

== Driven foundations ==
[[Image:driven pipe piles.jpg|thumb|Pipe piles being driven into the ground]]
[[File:Hausbuch Wolfegg 38v Ramme.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a hand-operated pile driver in Germany after 1480]]
[[Prefabricated]] piles are driven into the ground using a [[pile driver]]. Driven piles are constructed of [[wood]], [[reinforced concrete]], or [[steel]]. Wooden piles are made from the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]]s of tall trees. Concrete piles are available in square, octagonal, and round cross-sections (like [[Franki Piling System|Franki piles]]). They are reinforced with [[rebar]] and are often [[prestressed concrete|prestressed]]. Steel piles are either pipe piles or some sort of beam section (like an H-pile). Historically, [[wood piling|wood pile]]s used [[Pile Splice|splices]] to join multiple segments end-to-end when the driven depth required was too long for a single pile; today, splicing is common with [[steel pile]]s, though concrete piles can be [[Pile Splice|spliced]] with mechanical and other means. Driving piles, as opposed to drilling shafts, is advantageous because the soil displaced by driving the piles compresses the surrounding soil, causing greater friction against the sides of the piles, thus increasing their [[Structural engineering|load-bearing capacity]]. Driven piles are also considered to be "tested" for weight-bearing ability because of their method of installation; thus the motto of the Pile Driving Contractors' Association is "A Driven Pile...Is a Tested Pile!".&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.piledrivers.org/ PDCA]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pile foundation systems ===
Foundations relying on driven piles often have groups of piles connected by a '''pile cap''' (a large concrete block into which the heads of the piles are embedded) to distribute loads which are larger than one pile can bear. Pile caps and isolated piles are typically connected with [[grade beam]]s to tie the foundation elements together; lighter structural elements bear on the grade beams, while heavier elements bear directly on the pile cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonfoundationpros.com/reinforced-pier-systems/|title=
Reinforced Pier Systems - Pile Foundation Systems |accessdate=26 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monopile foundation===
A '''monopile foundation''' utilizes a single, generally large-diameter, foundation structural element to support all the loads (weight, wind, etc.) of a large above-surface structure.

A large number of monopile foundations&lt;ref name=own20090909&gt;

[http://www.greenenergytalkdirectory.org/library/Lynn-and-Inner-Dowsing.php Lynn and Inner Dowsing description]&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical construction process for a wind turbine subsea monopile foundation in sand includes driving a large hollow steel pile, of some 4&amp;nbsp;m in diameter with approximately 50mm thick walls, some 25&amp;nbsp;m deep into the seabed, through a 0.5&amp;nbsp;m layer of larger stone and gravel to minimize erosion around the pile. A "transition piece (complete with pre-installed features such as boat-landing arrangement, [[cathodic protection]], cable ducts for sub-marine cables, turbine tower flange, etc.)" is attached to the now deeply driven pile, the sand and water are removed from the centre of the pile and replaced with [[concrete]]. An additional layer of even larger stone, up to 0.5&amp;nbsp;m diameter, is applied to the surface of the seabed for longer-term erosion protection.&lt;ref name=hre20100412/&gt;

== Drilled piles ==
[[Image:DFmachine.JPG|thumb|right|A pile machine in [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]].]]
Also called '''caissons''', '''drilled shafts''', '''drilled piers''', '''Cast-in-drilled-hole piles (CIDH piles)''' or '''Cast-in-Situ''' piles, a borehole is drilled into the ground, then concrete (and often some sort of reinforcing) is placed into the borehole to form the pile. Rotary boring techniques allow larger diameter piles than any other piling method and permit pile construction through particularly dense or hard strata. Construction methods depend on the geology of the site; in particular, whether boring is to be undertaken in 'dry' ground conditions or through water-saturated strata. [[Casing (oil well)|Casing]] is often used when the sides of the borehole are likely to slough off before concrete is poured.

For end-bearing piles, drilling continues until the borehole has extended a sufficient depth (socketing) into a sufficiently strong layer. Depending on site geology, this can be a [[rock layer]], or hardpan, or other dense, strong layers. Both the diameter of the pile and the depth of the pile are highly specific to the ground conditions, loading conditions, and nature of the project. Pile depths may vary substantially across a project if the bearing layer is not level.

Drilled piles can be tested using a variety of methods to verify the pile integrity during installation.

=== Under-reamed piles ===
Under-reamed piles have mechanically formed enlarged bases that are as much as 6&amp;nbsp;m in diameter.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The form is that of an inverted cone and can only be formed in stable soils. The larger base diameter allows greater bearing capacity than a straight-shaft pile.

These pile are suited for expansive soils which are often subjected to seasonal moisture variations, as also filled up ground and loose or soft strata. They are used in normal ground condition also where economics are favorable.

===Augercast pile===
An augercast pile, often known as a [[continuous flight augering]] (CFA) pile, is formed by drilling into the ground with a hollow stemmed continuous flight [[auger (drill)|auger]] to the required depth or degree of resistance. No [[casing (oil well)|casing]] is required. A cement grout mix is then [[pump]]ed down the stem of the auger. While the cement grout is pumped, the auger is slowly withdrawn, conveying the soil upward along the flights. A shaft of fluid cement grout is formed to ground level. [[rebar|Reinforcement]] can be installed. Recent innovations in addition to stringent quality control allows reinforcing cages to be placed up to the full length of a pile when required. A typical reinforcing cage will consist of 4 to 8 bars from #5 to #8 bars typically 1/3 the length of the pile with longitudinal circular ties spaced along the length of the cage. Where tension loads are present it is typical to see a single full length bar placed at the center of each pile.

Augercast piles cause minimal disturbance, and are often used for noise and environmentally sensitive sites. Augercast piles are not generally suited for use in contaminated soils, due to expensive waste disposal costs. In cases such as these however a displacement pile may provide the cost efficiency of an augercast pile and minimal environmental impact. In ground containing obstructions or cobbles and boulders, augercast piles are less suitable as refusal above the design pile tip elevation may be encountered. In certain cases drill motors that produce more torque and horsepower may be able to mitigate these events.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Pier and grade beam foundation===
In drilled pier foundations, the piers can be connected with [[grade beam]]s on which the structure sits, sometimes with heavy column loads bearing directly on the piers. In some residential construction, the piers are extended above the ground level and wood beams bearing on the piers are used to support the structure. This type of foundation results in a '''crawl space''' underneath the building in which [[Electrical wiring|wiring]] and duct work can be laid during construction or re-modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall|first=Brain|title=How House Construction Works|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/repair/house6.htm|work=How Stuff Works|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialty piles==

=== Micropiles ===
Micropiles, also called mini piles, are often used for [[underpinning]]. They are also used to create foundations for a variety of project types, including [[highway]], [[bridge]] and [[transmission tower]] projects. They are especially useful at sites with difficult or restricted access, or with environmental sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwri.go.jp/eng/ujnr/tc/g/pdf/22/22-8-1siel.pdf pwri.go.jp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfi.org/pubdetail.asp?id=1725 dfi.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Micropiles are made of steel with diameters of 60 to 200&amp;nbsp;mm. Installation of micropiles through top soil, sand and cobblestones overburden and into soil rock can be achieved using Air Rotary or Mud Rotary drilling, impact driving, jacking, vibrating or screwing machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ismicropiles.org| title=International Society for Micropiles| accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Micropiles can also be used to construct a grout column around the shaft of a standard Helical Pile system, allowing for use in higher load applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foundationtechnologies.com/products/chance-helical-pulldown-micropiles/|title=CHANCE® Helical Pulldown® Micropiles|work=Foundation Technologies, Inc.|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tripod piles ===
The use of a tripod rig to install piles is one of the more traditional ways of forming piles. Although unit costs are generally higher than with most other forms of piling,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} it has several advantages which have ensured its continued use through to the present day. The tripod system is easy and inexpensive to bring to site, making it ideal for jobs with a small number of piles.

=== Sheet piles ===
[[File:Norra länken Hjorthagen 2009d.jpg|thumb|right|Sheet piles are used to restrain soft soil above the bedrock in this excavation]]
Sheet piling is a form of driven piling using thin interlocking sheets of steel to obtain a continuous barrier in the ground. The main application of sheet piles is in [[retaining wall]]s and [[dam#Cofferdams|cofferdams]] erected to enable permanent works to proceed.
Normally, vibrating hammer, t-crane and crawle drilling are used to establish sheet piles.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Soldier piles ===
[[Image:AGF00041.JPG|thumb|A soldier pile wall using reclaimed railway sleepers as lagging.]]
Soldier piles, also known as king piles or Berlin walls, are constructed of [[Structural steel#Common structural shapes|wide flange steel H sections]] spaced about 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;m apart and are driven prior to excavation. As the excavation proceeds, horizontal timber sheeting (lagging) is inserted behind the H pile flanges.

The horizontal earth pressures are concentrated on the soldier piles because of their relative rigidity compared to the lagging. Soil movement and [[subsidence]] is minimized by maintaining the lagging in firm contact with the soil.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Soldier piles are most suitable in conditions where well constructed walls will not result in subsidence such as over-consolidated clays, soils above the water table if they have some cohesion, and free draining soils which can be effectively dewatered, like sands.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Unsuitable soils include soft clays and weak running soils that allow large movements such as loose sands. It is also not possible to extend the wall beyond the bottom of the excavation and dewatering is often required.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Screw piles===
[[Screw piles]], also called ''helical piers'' and ''screw foundations'', have been used as foundations since the mid 19th century in [[screw-pile lighthouse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helical Piers FAQ|url=https://www.piertech.com/products/helical-piers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screw piles are galvanized iron pipe with helical fins that are turned into the ground by machines to the required depth. The screw distributes the load to the soil and is sized accordingly.

=== Suction Piles ===
Suction piles are used [[underwater]] to secure floating platforms. Tubular piles are driven into the seabed (or more commonly dropped a few metres into a soft seabed) and then a pump sucks water out at the top of the tubular, pulling the pile further down.

The proportions of the pile (diameter to height) are dependent upon the soil type. Sand is difficult to penetrate but provides good holding capacity, so the height may be as short as half the diameter. Clays and muds are easy to penetrate but provide poor holding capacity, so the height may be as much as eight times the diameter. The open nature of gravel means that water would flow through the ground during installation, causing 'piping' flow (where water boils up through weaker paths through the soil). Therefore, suction piles cannot be used in gravel seabeds.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Adfreeze Piles ===
[[Image:Frozen Piles.JPG|thumb|Adfreeze Piles supporting a building in [[Barrow, Alaska]], United States]]
In high latitudes where the ground is [[permafrost|continuously frozen]], adfreeze piles are used as the primary structural foundation method.

Adfreeze piles derive their strength from the bond of the frozen ground around them to the surface of the pile.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Adfreeze pile foundations are particularly sensitive in conditions which cause the permafrost to melt. If a building is constructed improperly, it will heat the ground below resulting in a failure of the foundation system.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Vibrated stone columns ===
[[Vibro stone column|Vibrated stone columns]] are a ground improvement technique where columns of coarse [[Aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] ("stone") are placed in soils with poor [[drainage]] or bearing capacity to improve the soils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrasystemsonline.com/services/stone-columns.html terrasystemsonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hospital Piles or Gallow Piles ===
Specific to marine structures, hospital piles are built to provide temporary support to marine structure components during refurbishment works. For example, when removing a river pontoon, the brow will be attached to hospital pile to support it. They are normal piles, usually with a chain or hook attachment.  Also known as Gallow piles.

== Piled walls ==
[[Image:New Orleans USACE-17th Canal-A-09-04-05 0004.JPG|thumb|Sheet piling, by a bridge, was used to block a canal in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], United States after [[Hurricane Katrina]] damaged it.]]

These methods of [[retaining wall]] construction employ bored piling techniques, normally CFA or rotary. They provide special advantages where available working space dictates that basement excavation faces be vertical. Both methods offer technically effective and offer a cost efficient temporary or permanent means of retaining the sides of bulk excavations even in water bearing strata. When used in permanent works, these walls can be designed to accommodate vertical loads in addition to [[moment (physics)|moments]] and horizontal [[force]]s. Construction of both methods is the same as for foundation bearing piles. Contiguous walls are constructed with small gaps between adjacent piles. The size of this space is determined by the strength of the soils.

===Secant piled walls===
[[Secant plane|Secant]] pile walls are constructed such that space is left between alternate 'female' piles for the subsequent construction of 'male' piles. Construction of 'male' piles involves boring through the concrete in the 'female' piles hole in order to key 'male' piles between. The male pile is the one where steel reinforcement cages are installed, though in some cases the female piles are also reinforced.

Secant piled walls can either be true hard/hard, hard/intermediate (firm), or hard/soft, depending on design requirements. Hard refers to structural concrete and firm or soft is usually a weaker grout mix containing bentonite.

All types of wall can be constructed as free standing [[cantilever]]s, or may be propped if space and sub-structure design permit. Where party wall agreements allow, [[Earth anchor|ground anchors]] can be used as tie backs.

===Slurry walls===
A slurry wall is a barrier built under ground using a mix of [[bentonite]] and water to prevent the flow of groundwater. A trench that would collapse due to the [[hydraulic pressure]] in the surrounding soil does not collapse as the slurry balances the hydraulic pressure.

==Deep mixing/mass stabilization techniques==
These are essentially variations of ''[[in situ]]'' reinforcements in the form of piles (as mentioned above), blocks or larger volumes.

Cement, lime/quick lime, flyash, sludge and/or other binders (sometimes called stabilizer) are mixed into the soil to increase bearing capacity. The result is not as solid as concrete, but should be seen as an improvement of the bearing capacity of the original soil.

The technique is most often applied on [[clay]]s or organic [[soil]]s like [[peat]]. The mixing can be carried out by pumping the binder into the soil whilst mixing it with a device normally mounted on an excavator or by excavating the masses, mixing them separately with the binders and refilling them in the desired area. The technique can also be used on lightly contaminated masses as a means of binding contaminants, as opposed to excavating them and transporting to landfill or processing.

==Classification of pile with respect to type of material==

===Timber===
{{main|Timber pilings}}
As the name implies, [[timber]] piles are made of [[wood]].

Historically, timber has been a plentiful, locally available resource in many areas. Today, timber piles are still more affordable than concrete or steel. Compared to other types of piles (steel or concrete), and depending on the source/type of timber, timber piles may not be suitable for heavier loads.

A main consideration regarding timber piles is that they should be protected from [[Decomposition|rotting]] above [[groundwater]] level. Timber will last for a long time below the groundwater level. For timber to rot, two elements are needed: water and oxygen. Below the [[groundwater]] level, dissolved oxygen is lacking even though there is ample water. Hence, timber tends to last for a long time below groundwater level. In 1648, the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]] was constructed on 13659 timber piles that still survive today since they were below groundwater level. Timber that is to be used above the water table can be protected from decay and insects by numerous forms of [[wood preservation]] using pressure treatment ([[alkaline copper quaternary]] (ACQ), [[chromated copper arsenate]] (CCA), [[creosote]], etc.).

Splicing timber piles is still quite common and is the easiest of all the piling materials to splice. The normal method for splicing is by driving the leader pile first, driving a steel tube (normally 60–100&amp;nbsp;cm long, with an internal diameter no smaller than the minimum toe diameter) half its length onto the end of the leader pile. The follower pile is then simply slotted into the other end of the tube and driving continues. The steel tube is simply there to ensure that the two pieces follow each other during driving. If uplift capacity is required, the splice can incorporate bolts, coach screws, spikes or the like to give it the necessary capacity.

===Iron===

Iron may be used for piling. These may be [[ductile iron piles|ductile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://helicaldrilling.com/company-news/ductile-iron-piles/|title=ductile iron piles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steel===
[[File:BatteredPiles.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Cutaway illustration. Deep inclined (battered) pipe piles support a precast segmented skyway where upper soil layers are weak muds.]]
[[pipe (material)|Pipe]] piles are a type of steel driven pile foundation and are a good candidate for inclined ([[Batter (walls)|battered]]) piles.

Pipe piles can be driven either open end or closed end. When driven open end, soil is allowed to enter the bottom of the pipe or tube. If an empty pipe is required, a jet of water or an auger can be used to remove the soil inside following driving. Closed end pipe piles are constructed by covering the bottom of the pile with a steel plate or cast steel shoe.

In some cases, pipe piles are filled with concrete to provide additional moment capacity or corrosion resistance. In the United Kingdom, this is generally not done in order to reduce the cost. In these cases corrosion protection is provided by allowing for a sacrificial thickness of steel or by adopting a higher grade of steel. If a concrete filled pipe pile is corroded, most of the load carrying capacity of the pile will remain intact due to the concrete, while it will be lost in an empty pipe pile.

The structural capacity of pipe piles is primarily calculated based on steel strength and concrete strength (if filled). An allowance is made for corrosion depending on the site conditions and local building codes.

Steel pipe piles can either be new steel manufactured specifically for the piling industry or reclaimed steel tubular casing previously used for other purposes such as oil and gas exploration.

H-Piles are structural beams that are driven in the ground for deep foundation application. They can be easily cut off or joined by welding or mechanical drive-fit splicers. If the pile is driven into a soil with low [[pH]] value, then there is a risk of corrosion, coal-tar epoxy or cathodic protection can be applied to slow or eliminate the corrosion process. It is common to allow for an amount of corrosion in design by simply over dimensioning the cross-sectional area of the steel pile. In this way, the corrosion process can be prolonged up to 50 years.

===Prestressed concrete piles===
Concrete piles are typically made with [[rebar|steel reinforcing]] and [[prestressed concrete|prestressing tendons]] to obtain the tensile strength required, to survive handling and driving, and to provide sufficient bending resistance.

Long piles can be difficult to handle and transport. Pile joints can be used to join two or more short piles to form one long pile. Pile joints can be used with both precast and prestressed concrete piles.

===Composite piles===
A "composite pile" is a pile made of steel and concrete members that are fastened together, end to end, to form a single pile. It is a combination of different materials or different shaped materials such as pipe and H-beams or steel and concrete.

[[File:Courtney Campbell Causeway pile jackets closeup.jpg|thumb|'Pile jackets' encasing old concrete piles in a saltwater environment to prevent corrosion and consequential weakening of the piles when cracks allow saltwater to contact the internal steel reinforcement rods]]
Wood (and other) pilings are used for supports in structures raised above water, for [[docks (maritime)|docks]], [[pier]]s,  [[jetty]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[oil platform]]s, and [[screw-pile lighthouse|lighthouses]]. These must be treated specially to avoid [[corrosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stjohns.ifas.ufl.edu/Sea/documents/Docks3-10.pdf|title=Fuzzy Dock Posts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dictionary of Art Historians''' (DAH) is an [[Internet encyclopedia project|online encyclopedia]] of topics relating to [[art historian]]s, [[art critic]]s and their dictionaries.  The mission of the project is to provide free, reliable, English-language information on published art historians.

The DAH was started in 1986 as a notecard project indexing art historians by the editors Lee R. Sorensen and Monique Daniels.&lt;ref name=DAH&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/about Mission statement and history of the DAH]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002 the project was migrated to the internet and in 2010 the project was adopted by the art history department of [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.wlu.edu/details.php?resID=604 Entry for the DAH] on library website of Washington and Lee university&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the project was adopted by the [http://www.dukewired.org/ Wired!

'''Disk Detective''' is the first [[NASA]] led and funded collaboration project with [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zooniverse.org/projects&lt;/ref&gt; It is NASA’s largest [[crowdsourcing]] [[citizen science]] project &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-032 NASA-Sponsored 'Disk Detective' Lets Public Search for New Planetary Nurseries&lt;/ref&gt; aiming at engaging the general public in search of stars, which are surrounded by dust-rich [[circumstellar disks]], where planets usually dwell and are formed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scilogs.com/marketing_for_scientists/launching-disk-detective-a-new-citizen-science-website/ Launching Disk Detective: A New Citizen Science Website › Marketing For Scientists&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Open Government National Action Plan|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/12/06/united-states-releases-its-second-open-government-national-action-plan|publisher=The White House Blog|author=Sinai Nick and Smith Gayle|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal investigator is [[Marc Kuchner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.diskdetective.org/#/team Disk Detective: Team]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
Disk Detective was launched in January 2014, and is expected to continue till 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disk Detective|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/disk-detective/#.VCHrTitdUpK|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public (aka the users) is invited to search through images captured by space agency's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Releases New WISE Mission Catalog of Entire Infrared Sky|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/news/wise20120314.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other sky surveys: the Two Micron All Sky Survey ([[2MASS]]), the [[Digitized Sky Survey]] (DSS) and the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS).

The images in Disk Detective have all been pre-selected to be extra bright at wavelengths where circumstellar dust emits thermal radiation. They are at [[mid-infrared]], near-infrared and optical wavelengths. Disks are not the only heavenly objects that appear bright at [[infrared]] wavelengths; [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]], galaxies, asteroids and interstellar dust clouds also emit at these wavelengths.  Computer [[algorithm]]s can't distinguish the difference, so it is necessary to examine all images by "eye" to make sure that the selected candidates are stars with disks, and not other [[celestial objects]].

==Classification==

At Disk Detective website, the images are presented in animated forms which are called flip books. The users view a flip book and classify the target object based on simple criteria, such as whether it is round in DSS2 or 2MASS images, or the object is extended beyond circle in WISE images, if there is more than one object in the circle or if it's off the crosshairs.

The ideal target is classified as '''good candidate''', and further vetted by the advanced research group into a list of '''debris disk of interest''' (or '''DDOI''') candidates.

The selected disk candidates will eventually become the future targets for NASA's [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and its successor, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]]. They also will be the topic for future publications in the scientific literature.

==Seeking objects==
The disks that NASA's scientists at the [[Goddard Space Flight Centre]] aim to find are [[debris disks]], which are older than 5 million years; and [[Young Stellar Object]], or YSO disks, which are younger than 5 million years.

==Discoveries==
The project has so far discovered the first debris disk with a white dwarf companion ([[HD 74389]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kuchner|first1=Marc J.|last2=Silverberg|first2=Steven M.|last3=Bans|first3=Alissa S.|last4=Bhattacharjee|first4=Shambo|last5=Kenyon|first5=Scott J.|last6=Debes|first6=John H.|last7=Currie|first7=Thayne|last8=Garcia|first8=Luciano|last9=Jung|first9=Dawoon|last10=Lintott|first10=Chris|last11=McElwain|first11=Michael|last12=Padgett|first12=Deborah L.|last13=Rebull|first13=Luisa M.|last14=Wisniewski|first14=John P.|last15=Nesvold|first15=Erika|last16=Schawinski|first16=Kevin|last17=Thaller|first17=Michelle L.|last18=Grady|first18=Carol A.|last19=Biggs|first19=Joseph|last20=Bosch|first20=Milton|last21=Cernohous|first21=Tadeás|last22=Luca|first22=Hugo A.

'''Earth sheltering''' is the architectural practice of using [[soil|earth]] against building walls for external [[thermal mass]], to reduce heat loss, and to easily maintain a steady indoor air temperature. Earth sheltering has become relatively more popular in modern times, especially among [[environmentalists]] and advocates of [[passive solar]] and [[sustainable architecture]].  However, the practice has been around for nearly as long as humans have been constructing their own shelters.

==Definition==
The expression earth-sheltering is a generic term, with the general meaning: ''building design in which soil plays an integral part''.

A building can be described as earth-sheltered if its external envelope is in contact with a thermally significant volume of soil or substrate (where “thermally significant” means making a functional contribution to the thermal effectiveness of the building in question.)

Earth-sheltered buildings consist of one or more of three types: earth-covered, earth-bunded, and subterranean.  An earth-covered building is one where the thermally effective element is placed solely on the roof, but is more usually a continuation of the earth-bunding at the unexposed elevations of the building.  An earth-bunded building is one where the thermally significant element insulates one or more of the sheltered elevations of the building.  The bunding can be partial or total.  A subterranean building is one where the thermally significant element insulates all elevations of the building, leaving only the roof exposed;  or, if the building is built into an incline, it may be that the roof is covered and only one elevation is left exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Harrall. J. 2007. Demonstrating the Viability and Growing Acceptability of Earth-Sheltered Buildings in the UK&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Living in earth shelters has been a large part of human history.
The connection to earth shelter dwellings began with the utilization of caves, and over time evolving technologies led to the construction of customized earth dwellings. Today, earth shelter construction is a rare practice, especially in the U.S.A. During the energy crisis and the [[1973 Oil Crisis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Homes/2006-10-01/Earth-sheltered-Homes.aspx|title=Earth-sheltered Homes|work=Mother Earth News}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[back-to-the-land movement]], there was a surge of interest in earth shelter/underground home construction in an effort toward self-sufficient living. However, progress has been slow, and earth shelter construction is often viewed by architects, engineers, and the public alike as an unconventional method of building. Techniques of earth sheltering have not yet become common knowledge, and much of society still remains unaware of the process or benefits of this type of building construction.

==Types of construction==
[[File:Cabaña subterránea en la región de Búðahraun, Vesturland, Islandia, 2014-08-14, DD 046.JPG|thumbnail|Example of an abandoned [[Iceland]]ic turf house in the region of {{Interlanguage link multi|Búðahraun|is}} via earth berming]]
* '''Earth berming:'''  Earth is piled up against exterior walls and packed, sloping down away from the house. The roof may or may not be fully earth covered, and windows/openings may occur on one or more sides of the shelter. Due to the building being above ground, fewer moisture problems are associated with earth berming in comparison to underground/fully recessed construction.
* '''In-hill construction:'''  The house is set into a slope or hillside. The most practical application is using a hill facing towards the equator (south in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and north in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]). There is only one exposed wall in this type of earth sheltering, the wall facing out of the hill, all other walls are embedded within the earth/hill.
* '''Underground/fully recessed construction:'''  The ground is excavated, and the house is set in below grade. It can also be referred to as an [[Atrium (architecture)|Atrium]] style due to the common atrium/courtyard constructed in the middle of the shelter to provide adequate light and ventilation.

==Benefits==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Addison Sod House]] --&gt;
The benefits of earth sheltering are numerous. They include usage of the earth as a thermal mass, extra protection from the natural elements, energy savings, substantial privacy in comparison to more conventional homes, efficient use of land in urban settings, low maintenance requirements, and the ability to take advantage of [[passive solar building design]].

The Earth's mass absorbs and retains heat. Over time, this heat is released to surrounding areas, such as an earth shelter. Because of the high density of the earth, change in the earth’s temperature occurs slowly. This is known as ‘thermal lag.’ Because of this principle, the earth provides a fairly constant temperature for the underground shelters, even when the outdoor temperature undergoes great fluctuation.  In most of the [[United States]], the average temperature of the earth once below the [[frost line]] is between 55 and 57 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 14 degrees Celsius). Frost line depths vary from region to region. In the USA frost lines can range from just under the surface to more than 40&amp;nbsp; inches.  Thus, at the base of a deep earth [[berm]], the house is heated against an exterior temperature gradient of perhaps ten to fifteen degrees, instead of against a steeper temperature grade where the air is on the outside of the wall instead of earth. During the summer, the temperature gradient helps to cool the house.

The reduction of air infiltration within an earth shelter can be highly profitable. Because three walls of the structure are mainly surrounded by earth, very little surface area is exposed to the outside air. This alleviates the problem of warm air escaping the house through gaps around windows and door. Furthermore, the earth walls protect against cold winter winds which might otherwise penetrate these gaps. However, this can also become a potential indoor air quality problem. Healthy air circulation is key.

As a result of the increased [[thermal mass]] of the structure, the [[thermal lag]] of the earth, the protection against unwanted air infiltration and the combined use of passive solar techniques, the need for extra heating and cooling is minimal. Therefore, there is a drastic reduction in energy consumption required for the home compared to homes of typical construction.

Earth shelters also provide privacy from neighbors, as well as soundproofing. The ground provides acoustic protection against outside noise. This can be a major benefit in urban areas or near highways. In urban areas, another benefit of underground sheltering is the efficient use of land. Many houses can sit below grade without spoiling the habitat above ground. Each site can contain both a house and a lawn/garden.

==Potential problems==
Problems of water seepage, internal [[condensation]], bad acoustics, and poor indoor air quality can occur if an earth shelter has not been properly designed.

Issues also include the sustainability of building materials. Earth sheltering often requires heavier construction than conventional building techniques, and many construction companies have limited or no experience with earth-sheltered construction, potentially compromising the physical construction of even the best designs.

The threat of water seepage occurs around areas where the waterproofing layers have been penetrated. Vents and ducts emerging from the roof can cause specific problems due to the possibility of movement. Precast concrete slabs can have a deflection of 1/2&amp;nbsp; inch or more when the earth/soil is layered on top of them. If the vents or ducts are held rigidly in place during this deflection, the result is usually the failure of the waterproofing layer. To avoid this difficulty, vents can be placed on other sides of the building (besides the roof), or separate segments of pipes can be installed. A narrower pipe in the roof that fits snugly into a larger segment of the building can also be used. The threat of water seepage, condensation, and poor indoor air quality can all be overcome with proper waterproofing and ventilation.

The building materials for earth-sheltered construction tend to be of non-biodegradable substances. Because the materials must keep water out, they are often made of plastics. Concrete is another material that is used in great quantity. More sustainable products are being tested to replace the [[cement]] within concrete (such as [[fly ash]]), as well as alternatives to reinforced concrete (see more under Materials: Structural). The excavation of a site is also drastically time- and labor-consuming. Overall, the construction is comparable to conventional construction, because the building requires minimal finishing and significantly less maintenance.

Condensation and poor quality indoor air problems can be solved by using earth tubes, or what is known as a [[geothermal heat pump]]—a concept different from earth sheltering. With modification, the idea of earth tubes can be used for underground buildings: instead of looping the earth tubes, leave one end open downslope to draw in fresh air using the chimney effect by having exhaust vents placed high in the underground building.

==Landscape and site planning==
The [[site planning]] for an earth-sheltered building is an integral part of the overall design; investigating the landscape of a potential building site is crucial. There are many factors to assess when surveying a site for underground construction. The topography, regional climate, vegetation, water table and [[soil type]] of varying landscapes all play dynamic roles in the design and application of earth shelters.

===Topography===
On land that is relatively flat, a fully recessed house with an open courtyard is the most appropriate design. On a sloping site, the house is set right into the hill. The slope will determine the location of the window wall; a south-facing exposed wall is the most practical in the Northern hemisphere (and north-facing in the Southern hemisphere) due to solar benefits.  The most practical house design in the tropics (and with equal advantage in both hemispheres) is that the two shorter walls on the ends be exposed, one facing east and the other facing west.

===Regional climate===
Depending on the region and site selected for earth-sheltered construction, the benefits and objectives of the earth shelter construction vary. For cool and temperate climates, objectives consist of retaining winter heat, avoiding infiltration, receiving winter sun, using thermal mass, shading and ventilating during the summer, and avoiding winter winds and cold pockets. For hot, arid climates objectives include maximizing humidity, providing summer shade, maximizing summer air movement, and retaining winter heat. For hot, humid climates objectives include avoiding summer humidity, providing summer ventilation, and retaining winter heat.

Regions with extreme daily and seasonal temperatures emphasize the value of earth as a thermal mass. In this way, earth sheltering is most effective in regions with high cooling and heating needs and high-temperature differentials. In regions such as the southeastern United States, earth sheltering may need additional care in maintenance and construction due to condensation problems in regard to the high humidity. The ground temperature of the region may be too high to permit earth cooling if temperatures fluctuate only slightly from day to night. Preferably, there should be adequate winter solar radiation and sufficient means for natural ventilation. Wind is a critical aspect to evaluate during site planning, for reasons regarding wind chill and heat loss, as well as ventilation of the shelter. In the Northern Hemisphere, south facing slopes tend to avoid cold winter winds typically blown in from the north. Fully recessed shelters also offer adequate protection against these harsh winds. However, atria within the structure have the ability to cause minor turbulence depending on the size. In the summer, it is helpful to take advantage of the prevailing winds. Because of the limited window arrangement in most earth shelters, and the resistance to air infiltration, the air within a structure can become stagnant if proper ventilation is not provided. By making use of the wind, natural ventilation can occur without the use of fans or other active systems.  Knowing the direction, and intensity, of seasonal winds, is vital in promoting cross ventilation. Vents are commonly placed in the roof of bermed or fully recessed shelters to achieve this effect.

===Vegetation===
The [[plant]] cover of the landscape is another important factor.  Adding plants can be both positive and negative.  Nearby trees may be valuable in wet climates because their roots remove water. However a prospective builder should know what types of trees are in the area and how large and rapidly they tend to grow, due to possible solar-potential compromise with their growth. Vegetation can provide a windbreak for houses exposed to winter winds. The growth of small vegetation, especially those with deep roots, also helps in the prevention of erosion, on the house and in the surrounding site.

===Soil and drainage===
The soil type is one of the essential factors during site planning. The soil needs to provide adequate [[bearing capacity]] and [[drainage]], and help to retain heat. With respects to drainage, the most suitable type of soil for earth sheltering is a mixture of [[sand]] and [[gravel]]. Well, graded gravels have a large bearing capacity (about 8,000 pounds per square foot), excellent drainage and a low [[Frost heaving|frost heave]] potential. Sand and [[clay]] can be susceptible to [[erosion]]. Clay soils, while least susceptible to erosion, often do not allow for proper drainage, and have a higher potential for frost heaves. Clay soils are more susceptible to thermal shrinking and expanding. Being aware of the moisture content of the soil and the fluctuation of that content throughout the year will help prevent potential heating problems. Frost heaves can also be problematic in some soil. Fine grain soils retain moisture the best and are most susceptible to heaving. A few ways to protect against [[capillary action]] responsible for frost heaves are placing foundations below the freezing zone or insulating ground surface around shallow footings, replacement of frost-sensitive soils with granular material, and interrupting capillary draw of moisture by putting a drainage layer of coarser material in the existing soil.

Water can cause potential damage to earth shelters if it ponds around the shelter. Avoiding sites with a high [[water table]] is crucial. Drainage, both surface, and subsurface must be properly dealt with. Waterproofing applied to the building is essential.

Atrium designs have an increased risk of flooding, so the surrounding land should slope away from the structure on all sides. A drain pipe at the perimeter of the roof edge can help collect and remove additional water. For bermed homes, an interceptor drain at the crest of the berm along the edge of the rooftop is recommended. An interceptor drainage [[Swale (geographical feature)|swale]] in the middle of the berm is also helpful or the back of the berm can be terraced with retaining walls. On sloping sites runoff may cause problems. A drainage swale or gully can be built to divert water around the house, or a gravel-filled trench with a drain tile can be installed along with footing drains.

Soil stability should also be considered, especially when evaluating a sloping site. These slopes may be inherently stable when left alone, but cutting into them can greatly compromise their structural stability. Retaining walls and backfills may have to be constructed to hold up the slope prior to shelter construction.

==Construction methods==

===Current methods===
In earth-sheltered construction, there is often extensive excavation done on the building site.  An excavation several feet larger than the walls' planned perimeter is made to allow for access to the outside of the wall for waterproofing and insulation.  Once the site is prepared and the utility lines installed, a foundation of reinforced concrete is poured.  The walls are then installed. Usually, they are either poured in place or formed either on or off-site and then moved into place.  Reinforced concrete is the most common choice.  The process is repeated for the roof structure.  If the walls, floor, and roof are all to be poured in place, it is possible to make them with a single pour.  This can reduce the likelihood of there being cracks or leaks at the joints where the concrete has cured at different times.

On the outside of the concrete, a waterproofing system is applied.  The most frequently used waterproofing system includes a layer of liquid asphalt onto which a heavy grade waterproof membrane is affixed, followed by a final liquid water sealant which may be sprayed on.  It is very important to make sure that all of the seams are carefully sealed. It is very difficult to locate and repair leaks in the waterproofing system after the building is completed.

One or more layers of insulation board or foam are added on the outside of the waterproofing.  If the insulation chosen is porous, a top layer of waterproofing is added. After everything is complete, the earth is backfilled into the remaining space at the exterior of the wall and sometimes over the roof to accommodate a green roof.  Any exposed walls and the interior are finished according to the owners' preferences.

===Materials===

====Structural====
Reinforced concrete is the most commonly used structural material in earth shelter construction.  It is strong and readily available.  Untreated wood rots within five years of use in earth shelter construction.  Steel can be used but needs to be encased by concrete to keep it from direct contact with the soil which corrodes the metal.  Bricks and CMUs (concrete masonry units) are also possible options in earth shelter construction but must be reinforced to keep them from shifting under vertical pressure unless the building is constructed with arches and vaults.

Unfortunately, reinforced concrete is not the most environmentally sustainable material.  The concrete industry is working to develop products that are more earth-friendly in response to consumer demands.  Products like [[Grancrete]] and [[Hycrete]] are becoming more readily available.  They claim to be environmentally friendly and either reduce or eliminate the need for additional waterproofing. However, these are new products and have not been extensively used in earth shelter construction yet.

Some unconventional approaches are also proposed.  One such method is a PSP method proposed by Mike Oehler. The PSP method uses wooden posts, plastic sheeting and non-conventional ideas that allow more windows and ventilation.  This design also reduces some runoff problems associated with conventional designs.  The method uses wood posts, a frame that acts like a rib to distribute settling forces, specific construction methods which rely on fewer pieces of heavy equipment, plastic sheeting, and earth floors with plastic and carpeting.

====Waterproofing====
Several layers are used for waterproofing in earth shelter construction.  The first layer is meant to seal any cracks or pores in the structural materials, also working as an adhesive for the waterproof membrane.  The membrane layer is often a thick flexible polyethylene sheeting called [[EPDM rubber|EPDM]].  EPDM is the material usually used in a water garden, pond and swimming pool construction.  This material also prevents roots from burrowing through the waterproofing.  EPDM is very heavy to work with and can be chewed through by some common insects like fire ants. It is also made from petrochemicals, making it less than perfectly environmentally friendly.

There are various cementitious coatings that can be used as waterproofing.  The product is sprayed directly onto the unprotected surface.  It dries and acts like a huge ceramic layer between the wall and earth.  The challenge with this method is, if the wall or foundation shifts in any way, it cracks and water is able to penetrate through it easily.

Bituthene (registered name) is very similar to the three coat layering process only in one step.  It comes already layered in sheets and has a self-adhesive backing.  The challenge with this is the same as with the manual layering method, in addition, it is sun sensitive and must be covered very soon after application.

Eco-Flex is an environmentally friendly waterproofing membrane that seems to work very well on foundations, but not much is known about its effectiveness in earth sheltering.  It is among a group of liquid paint-on waterproofing products.  The main challenges with these are they must be carefully applied, making sure that every area is covered to the right thickness, and that every crack or gap is tightly sealed.

[[Bentonite]] clay is the alternative that is closest to optimum on the environmental scale.  It is naturally occurring and self-healing.  The drawback to this system is that it is very heavy and difficult for the owner/builder to install and subject to termite damage.

Bi-membranes have been used extensively throughout Australia where 2 membranes are paired together—typically 2 coats of water-based epoxy as a 'sealer' and stop the internal vapor pressure of the moist concrete exploding bubbles of vapor up underneath the membrane when exposed to hot sun. The bond strength of epoxy to concrete is stronger than the internal bond strength of concrete so the membranes won't 'blow' off the wall in the sun. Epoxies are very brittle so they are paired up with an overcoat of a high-build flexible water-based acrylic membrane in multiple coats of different colors to ensure film coverage—this is reinforced with non-woven polypropylene textile in corners and changes in direction.

====Insulation====
Unlike the conventional building, earth shelters require the insulation on the exterior of the building rather than inside the wall.  One reason for this is that it provides protection for the waterproof membrane against freeze damage, another is that the earth shelter is able to better retain its desired temperature.  There are two types of insulation used in earth shelter construction.  The first is close-celled extruded polystyrene sheets.  Two to three inches glued to the outside of the waterproofing is generally sufficient.  The second type of insulation is a spray on foam.  This works very well where the shape of the structure is unconventional, rounded or difficult to get to.  Foam insulation requires an additional protective top coat such as foil to help it resist water penetration.

In some low budget earth shelters, insulation may not be applied to the walls.  These methods rely on the U factor or thermal heat storage capacity of the earth itself below the frost layer.  These designs are the exception however and risk frost heave damage in colder climates.  The theory behind no insulation designs relies on using the thermal mass of the earth to store heat, rather than relying on a heavy masonry or cement inner structures that exist in a typical passive solar house.  This is the exception to the rule and cold temperatures may extend down into the earth above the frost line making insulation necessary for higher efficiencies.

==Design for energy conservation==
Earth sheltered homes are often constructed with energy conservation and savings in mind. Specific designs of earth shelters allow for maximum savings. For bermed or in-hill construction, a common plan is to place all the living spaces on the side of the house facing the equator. This provides maximum solar radiation to bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchen spaces. Rooms that do not require natural daylight and extensive heating such as the bathroom, storage, and utility room are typically located on the opposite (or in hill) side of the shelter.  This type of layout can also be transposed to a double level house design with both levels completely underground. This plan has the highest energy efficiency of earth sheltered homes because of the compact configuration as well as the structure being submerged deeper in the earth. This provides it with a greater ratio of earth cover to an exposed wall than a one-storey shelter would.

With an atrium earth shelter, the living spaces are concentrated around the atrium. The atrium arrangement provides a much less compact plan than that of the one or two story bermed/in hill design; therefore it is commonly less energy efficient, in terms of heating needs. This is one of the reasons why atrium designs are classically applied to warmer climates. However, the atrium does tend to trap air within it which is then heated by the sun and helps reduce heat loss.

==Earth sheltering with solar heating==
Earth sheltering is often combined with solar heating systems. Most commonly, the utilization of passive solar design techniques is used in earth shelters. In the Northern Hemisphere, a south facing structure with the north, east, and west sides covered with earth is the most effective application for [[passive solar]] systems.  A large double glazed window, triple glazed or [[Zomeworks]] [[beadwall]] (vacuum/blower pumps that filled your double pane solar windows with styrofoam balls at night for extra insulation and vacuumed the beads out in the morning, patent now expired.  This changes a window from an R3 thermal resistance to an R16 to R32(depending on the thickness of styrofoam bead wall)), spanning most of the length of the south wall is critical for solar heat gain. It is helpful to accompany the window with insulated drapes to protect against heat loss at night. Also, during the summer months, providing an overhang, or some sort of shading device, is used to block out an excess solar gain. Combining solar heating with earth sheltering is referred to as "[[annualized geo solar]] design", "Passive annual heat storage", or sometimes as an "Umbrella house." (See Nick Pine's posting on Usenet alt.homepower and alt.solar.thermal groups about this type of house.) In the umbrella house, Polystyrene insulation extends around {{convert|23|ft|m}} radius from underground walls. A plastic film covers the insulation (for waterproofing), and soil is a layer on top. The materials slope downward, like an umbrella. It sheds excess water while keeping the soil temperature warm and dry.

[[Passive cooling]] which pulls air with a fan or convection from a nearly constant temperature air into buried [[Earth cooling tubes]] and then into the house living space.  This also provides fresh air to occupants and the air exchange required by [[ASHRAE]].

==Earth shelter construction: history and examples==

===Berming===
[[File:EarthShelterRestAreaOH.JPG|thumb|right|Earth Sheltered rest area along [[Interstate 77 in Ohio]], USA]]

Historically, earth berming was a common building practice that combined heavy timber framing and rough stonework with stacking thick layers of sod or peat against the walls and on the roof.  This served as excellent protection from the elements.  In a relatively short period of time the earth layers grow together leaving the structure with an appearance of a hill with a door.

In these early structures, the heavy timber framing acted as structural support and added comfort and warmth to the interior.  Rough stone was often stacked along the outer walls with a simple lime mortar for structural support and often serves as an exterior facing wall and foundation.  There is a greater use of stone work in earth shelter structures in areas where timber is scarce.  These are the most sustainable of the earth shelters as far as materials go because they are able to decompose and return to earth.  This is why there are few remaining example like Hvalsey Church in Greenland where only the stacked stones remain. One of the oldest examples of berming, dating back some 5,000 years, can be found at [[Skara Brae]] in the [[Orkney Islands]] off northern [[Scotland]].

Today’s bermed earth structures are built quite differently from those of the past.  Common construction employs large amounts of steel reinforced concrete acting as structural support and building shell.  Bulldozers or bobcats are used to pile earth around the building and on the roof instead of stacking earth in place.  One modern example of bermed earth structures is the [[Hockerton Housing Project]], a community of 5 homes in [[Nottinghamshire]], [[England]].

===In-hill===
One historical example of in-hill earth shelters would be [[Mesa Verde]], in the southwest United States.  These building are constructed directly onto the ledges and caves on the face of the cliffs.  The front wall is built up with local stone and earth to enclose the structure.  Similarly today, in-hill earth shelter construction utilizes the natural formation of a hillside for two to three of the exterior walls and sometimes the roof of a structure.  Alternative builders craft a type of in-hill structure known as an [[Earthship]].  In Earthship construction, [[tire]]s rammed with earth are used as structural materials for three of the walls and generally have a front façade of windows to capture passive solar energy.

A well-known example of an earth-sheltered home is [[Bill Gates' house|the residence of Bill Gates]], who had it built over a period of several years on a heavily wooded site on the shore of [[Lake Washington]], USA. It is an excellent example of the lack of obtrusiveness of this kind of home, since it appears much smaller than it actually is, when seen from the lake.

===Underground===
Though underground construction is relatively uncommon in the US (except for basements where only 1 floor is underground), successful examples can be found in Australia where the ground is so hard that there is little to no need for structural supports and a pick ax and shovel are the tools of the builder/remodeler. See [[Coober Pedy]] and [[Lightning Ridge]]. The [[Forestiere Underground Gardens]] in Fresno, California is a North American example.

In the early 1970s, China undertook the construction of [[Underground City (Beijing)|Dixia Cheng]], a city underneath [[Beijing]].  It was primarily a complex of bomb shelters that could house 40% of the population at that time.  It was a response to the fear of Soviet attack.  Parts of it are now used in more commercial ventures.

{{short description|Termination of a taxon by the death of the last member}}
{{Conservation status}}
{{Evolutionary biology}}
In [[biology]], '''extinction''' is the termination of an [[organism]] or of a group of organisms ([[taxon]]), normally a [[species]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the [[endling|last individual]] of the species, although the [[Functional extinction|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point. Because a species' potential [[Range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where a species presumed extinct abruptly "reappears" (typically in the [[fossil|fossil record]]) after a period of apparent absence.

Through [[evolution]], species arise through the process of [[speciation]]—where new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]]—and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

A species is extinct when the last existing member dies. Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that can reproduce and create a new generation. A species may become [[functional extinction|functionally extinct]] when only a handful of individuals survive, which cannot reproduce due to poor health, age, sparse distribution over a large range, a lack of individuals of both sexes (in [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] species), or other reasons.

Pinpointing the extinction (or [[pseudoextinction]]) of a species requires a [[Theory of species|clear definition of that species]]. If it is to be declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species, and from any other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) plays a key role in the [[punctuated equilibrium]] hypothesis of [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Niles Eldredge, ''Time Frames: Rethinking of Darwinian Evolution and the Theory of Punctuated Equilibria'', 1986, Heinemann {{ISBN|0-434-22610-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ecology]], ''extinction'' is often used informally to refer to [[local extinction]], in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study, but may still exist elsewhere. This phenomenon is also known as extirpation. Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations; [[wolf reintroduction]] is an example of this. Species which are not extinct are termed [[Extant taxon|extant]]. Those that are extant but threatened by extinction are referred to as [[threatened]] or [[endangered species]].

[[File:Edwards' Dodo.jpg|thumb|The [[dodo]] of [[Mauritius]], shown here in a 1626 illustration by [[Roelant Savery]], is an often-cited example of [[Holocene extinction|modern extinction]]&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diamond | first = Jared | authorlink = Jared Diamond | title = [[Guns, Germs, and Steel]] | publisher = [[W. W. Norton]]|year = 1999| isbn = 0-393-31755-2 | pages=43–44 |chapter=Up to the Starting Line }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Currently an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species. These are reflected by the creation of the [[conservation status]] [[extinct in the wild|"extinct in the wild" (EW)]]. Species listed under this status by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) are not known to have any living specimens in the wild, and are maintained only in [[zoo]]s or other artificial environments. Some of these species are functionally extinct, as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild.&lt;ref name="Maas"&gt;Maas, Peter. "[http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/wilduk.htm Extinct in the Wild" ''The Extinction Website''. URL accessed January 26 2007.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216030551/http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/wilduk.htm |date=February 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When possible, modern [[zoology|zoological]] institutions try to maintain a [[viable population]] for species preservation and possible future [[reintroduction]] to the wild, through use of carefully planned [[breeding program]]s.

The extinction of one species' wild population can have knock-on effects, causing further extinctions. These are also called "chains of extinction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf |title=Deleting species from model food webs |accessdate=2007-02-15 |format=PDF |work= |author=Quince, C. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925092540/http://theory.ph.man.ac.uk/~ajm/qui05a.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-25|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially common with extinction of [[keystone species]].

A new study suggests that it could take up to 5 to 7 million years for mammal diversity to be restored to its state prior to the arrival of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mammal-diversity-extinction-study_us_5bc59f68e4b055bc94796ecf|title=Mammals Will Still Be Recovering From Human Destruction Long After We're Gone|last=Mosbergen|first=Dominique|date=2018-10-16|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pseudoextinction ===
{{Main|Pseudoextinction}}

Extinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction or phyletic extinction. Effectively, the old taxon vanishes, transformed ([[anagenesis]]) into a successor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Michael |last2=Mulligan |first2=Pamela |last3=Stansfield |first3=William |title=A Dictionary of Genetics |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; or split into more than one ([[cladogenesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Leighton |first=Lindsey R. |title=Taxon Characteristics That Promote Survivorship Through the Permian-Triassic Interval: Transition from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic Brachiopod Fauna  |journal=Paleobiology |date=2009 |volume=34 |pages=65–79 |doi=10.1666/06082.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct ''[[Hyracotherium]]'', which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern [[horse]], is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because there are several extant species of ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]]'', including [[zebra]] and [[donkey]]. However, as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind, one cannot say whether ''Hyracotherium'' [[Evolution of the horse|evolved into more modern horse species]] or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses. Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups.

===Lazarus taxa===
{{Main|Lazarus taxa}}
The [[coelacanth]], a fish related to [[lungfish]] and [[tetrapod]]s, was considered to have been extinct since the end of the [[Cretaceous Period]] until 1938 when a specimen was found, off the [[Chalumna River]] (now Tyolomnqa) on the east coast of South Africa.&lt;ref name="dinofish"&gt;[http://www.dinofish.com/discoa.htm "Discovery" of the Coelacanth]&lt;/ref&gt; Museum curator [[Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer]] discovered the fish among the catch of a local angler, Captain Hendrick Goosen, on December 23, 1938.&lt;ref name="dinofish" /&gt; A local chemistry professor, [[James Leonard Brierley Smith|JLB Smith]], confirmed the fish's importance with a famous cable: "MOST IMPORTANT PRESERVE SKELETON AND GILLS = FISH DESCRIBED".&lt;ref name="dinofish" /&gt;

Far more recent possible or presumed extinctions of species which may turn out still to exist include the thylacine, or [[Tasmanian tiger]] (''Thylacinus cynocephalus''), the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in 1936; the [[Honshū wolf|Japanese wolf]] (''Canis lupus hodophilax''), last sighted over 100 years ago; the [[ivory-billed woodpecker]] (''Campephilus principalis''), last sighted for certain in 1944; and the [[slender-billed curlew]] (''Numenius tenuirostris''), not seen since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/2013/02/21/4-extinct-species-hope-rediscover/ 4 Extinct species that people still hope to rediscover – John R.

As long as species have been evolving, species have been going extinct. It is estimated that over 99.9% of all species that ever lived are extinct. The average lifespan of a species is 1–10 million years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Conservation of Wildlife Populations: Demography, Genetics and Management|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fVLEV64qYfcC|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|date = 2009-03-12|isbn = 9781444308938|language = en|first = L. Scott|last = Mills|page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this varies widely between taxa.
There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. "Just as each species is unique", write Beverly and [[Stephen C. Stearns]], "so is each extinction&amp;nbsp;... the causes for each are varied—some subtle and complex, others obvious and simple".&lt;ref name="Stearns"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stearns | first = Beverly Peterson and Stephen C. | title = Watching, from the Edge of Extinction | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-300-08469-2 | pages=x |chapter=Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most simply, any species that cannot [[Survival skills|survive]] and [[reproduction|reproduce]] in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when [[toxic]] [[pollution]] renders its entire [[habitat]] unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors. Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]].

Assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on [[nature and nurture]].&lt;ref name="Raup"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raup |first=David M. |author2=J. John Sepkoski Jr. |date=March 1982 |title=Mass extinctions in the marine fossil record |journal=Science |volume=215 |issue=4539|pages = 1501–3 |doi=10.1126/science.215.4539.1501 |pmid=17788674 |bibcode=1982Sci...215.1501R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question of whether more extinctions in the [[fossil]] record have been caused by [[evolution]] or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion; Mark Newman, the author of ''Modeling Extinction'', argues for a mathematical model that falls between the two positions.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt; By contrast, [[conservation biology]] uses the [[extinction vortex]] model to classify extinctions by cause. When concerns about [[human extinction]] have been raised, for example in Sir [[Martin Rees]]' 2003 book ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', those concerns lie with the effects of [[climate change]] or [[technology|technological]] disaster.

Currently, environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity, and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of [[conservation movement|conservation]] programs.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt; Humans can cause extinction of a species through [[overharvesting]], [[pollution]], [[habitat destruction]], introduction of [[invasive species]] (such as new [[predator]]s and food [[competitors]]), overhunting, and other influences. Explosive, unsustainable human [[population growth]] is an essential cause of the extinction crisis.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=sixth-extinction Population Bomb Author's Fix For Next Extinction: Educate Women]". ''Scientific American''. August 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), 784 extinctions have been recorded since the year 1500, the arbitrary date selected to define "recent" extinctions, up to the year 2004; with many more likely to have gone unnoticed.

{{See also|Extinction vortex|Genetic erosion|Mutational meltdown}}
If [[adaptation]] increasing population [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] is slower than environmental degradation plus the accumulation of slightly deleterious [[mutation]]s, then a population will go extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bertram|first1=J|last2=Gomez|first2=K|last3=Masel|first3=J|title=Predicting patterns of long-term adaptation and extinction with population genetics|journal=Evolution|date=February 2017|volume=71|issue=2|pages=204–214|doi=10.1111/evo.13116|arxiv=1605.08717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller populations have fewer beneficial mutations entering the population each generation, slowing adaptation. It is also easier for slightly deleterious mutations to [[fixation (population genetics)|fix]] in small populations; the resulting positive feedback loop between small population size and low fitness can cause [[mutational meltdown]].

Limited geographic range is the most important determinant of [[genus]] extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as [[#Mass extinctions|mass extinction]] arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Payne, J.L.  |author2=S. Finnegan | year=2007 | title=The effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mass extinction | journal=[[PNAS|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.]] | volume=104 | issue=25 | pages=10506–11 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0701257104 | pmid=17563357| pmc=1890565|bibcode = 2007PNAS..10410506P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited geographic range is a cause both of small population size and of greater vulnerability to local environmental catastrophes.

Extinction rates can be affected not just by population size, but by any factor that affects [[evolvability]], including [[balancing selection]], [[cryptic genetic variation]], [[phenotypic plasticity]], and [[robustness (evolution)|robustness]]. A diverse or deep [[gene pool]] gives a population a higher chance in the short term of surviving an adverse change in conditions. Effects that cause or reward a loss in [[genetic diversity]] can increase the chances of extinction of a species. [[Population bottleneck]]s can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make [[inbreeding]] more frequent.

The gene pool of a [[species]] or a [[population]] is the variety of genetic information in its living members.

=== Habitat degradation ===
{{Main|Habitat destruction}}
Habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species' [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] may alter the [[fitness landscape]] to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming [[toxicity|toxic]], or indirectly, by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.

Habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through [[contamination]] or [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness.

Habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats. The widespread destruction of [[tropical rainforest]]s and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive. For example, a [[fern]] that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it. Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by [[bottom trawling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clover |first=Charles |year=2004 |title=The End of the Line: How overfishing is changing the world and what we eat |publisher=Ebury Press |location=London |isbn=0-09-189780-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation. [[Global warming]] has allowed some species to expand their range, bringing unwelcome{{according to whom|date=May 2016}} competition to other species that previously occupied that area. Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species, while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources. Vital resources including [[water]] and food can also be limited during habitat degradation, leading to extinction.

[[File:Bufo periglenes2.jpg|thumb|The [[golden toad]] was last seen on May 15, 1989. [[Decline in amphibian populations]] is ongoing worldwide]]

=== Predation, competition, and disease ===
{{See also|Island restoration}}
In the natural course of events, species become extinct for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (many people would say premature extinction) of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by [[introduced species|transporting]] [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. [[livestock]] released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. [[rat]]s escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an [[Invasive species|invasive alien species]] does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect [[Endemic (ecology)|native]] species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing [[pathogen]]s or [[parasite]]s that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the "overkill hypothesis", the swift extinction of the [[megafauna]] in areas such as Australia (40,000 years before present), [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] (12,000 years before present), [[Madagascar]], [[Hawaii]] (300–1000 CE), and New Zealand (1300–1500 CE), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, Anita.

=== Coextinction ===
{{Main|Coextinction}}
[[File:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|The large [[Haast's eagle]] and [[moa]] from New Zealand]]

Coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another; for example, the extinction of [[parasitism|parasitic]] insects following the loss of their hosts. Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its [[pollinator]], or to [[predator]]s in a [[food chain]] who lose their prey. "Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems&amp;nbsp;... While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one".&lt;ref name="Koh"&gt;Koh, Lian Pih. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Vol 305, Issue 5690, 1632–1634, 10 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coextinction is especially common when a [[keystone species]] goes extinct.
Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of [[biodiversity loss]]. There may be a cascade of coextinction across the [[trophic level]]s. Such effects are most severe in [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] and parasitic relationships. An example of coextinction is the [[Haast's eagle]] and the [[moa]]: the Haast's eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct. The moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the Haast's eagle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Dunn | first = Robert |author2=Nyeema Harris|author3=Robert Colwell|author4=Lian Pin Koh|author5=Navjot Sodhi | title = Proceedings of the Royal Society | work = The sixth mass coextinction: are most endangered species parasites and mutualists? | publisher = [[The Royal Society]] | year = 2009 | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1670/3037.short | accessdate = April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1998 survey&lt;!-- Needs updating. Survey is now 20+ years old.  --&gt; of 400 biologists conducted by [[New York City|New York]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]], nearly 70% believed that the Earth is currently in the early stages of a human-caused mass extinction,&lt;ref name="AMNH"&gt;[[American Museum of Natural History]].

In that survey, the same proportion of respondents agreed with the prediction that up to 20% of all living populations could become extinct within 30 years (by 2028). A 2014 special edition of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' declared there is widespread consensus on the issue of human-driven mass species extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date = 25 July 2014 | title = Vanishing fauna (Special issue)|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=345|issue=6195| pages = 392–412 | url =http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/vanishing/index.xhtml?_ga=1.172413478.429831163.1471029002 |doi=10.1126/science.345.6195.392| bibcode= | last1 = Vignieri | first1 = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[E. O.

Through the 18th century, much of Western society adhered to the belief that the world was created by God and as such was complete and perfect.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowland|first=Stephen|date=2009|title=Thomas Jefferson, extinction, and the evolving view of Earth history in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries|url=http://memoirs.gsapubs.org/content/203/225.abstract|journal=GSA Memoirs|volume=203|pages=225–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the [[Great chain of being|Great Chain of Being]], in which all life on earth, from the tiniest microorganism to God, is linked in a continuous chain.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33224/33224-h/33224-h.htm|title=The Principles of Geology or, The Modern Changes of the Earth and its Inhabitants Considered as Illustrative of Geology|last=Lyells|first=Charles|publisher=Appleton Co|year=1854|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extinction of a species was impossible under this model, as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] was a firm supporter of the [[Great Chain of Being]] and an opponent of extinction,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/history-of-geology/on-the-extinction-of-species/|title=On the Extinction of Species|last=Bressan|first=David|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; famously denying the extinction of the wooly mammoth on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqHwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88&amp;lpg=PT88&amp;dq=%22Extinction,+diversity,+and+endangerment%22+david+sepkoski&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tpA16i2uMn&amp;sig=oH9FP_N1r2swggDmOvzLzg8LH10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitpMKv9NTTAhUh7oMKHUOaA2wQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Extinction,%20diversity,%20and%20endangerment%22%20david%20sepkoski&amp;f=false|title=Endangerment, Biodiversity and Culture|last=Vidal|first=Fernando|last2=Dias|first2=Nélia|date=2015-06-19|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317538073|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of fossils were discovered in the late 17th century that appeared unlike any living species. As a result, the scientific community embarked on a voyage of creative rationalization, seeking to understand what had happened to these species within a framework that did not account for total extinction. In October 1686, [[Robert Hooke]] presented an impression of a [[nautilus]] to the [[Royal Society]] that was more than two feet in diameter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7LriV7aZpkC&amp;pg=PA403&amp;lpg=PA403&amp;dq=hooke+nautilus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DWXg0qsaJ8&amp;sig=vUkaTNuCy8Ud9RjliZubXBdD4bM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD6rGQptXTAhUF2IMKHfamAc8Q6AEIVjAL#v=onepage&amp;q=hooke%20nautilus&amp;f=false|title=The Forgotten Genius: The Biography of Robert Hooke, 1635–1703|last=Inwood|first=Stephen|date=2005-05-03|publisher=MacAdam/Cage Publishing|isbn=9781596921153|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and morphologically distinct from any known living species. [[Robert Hooke|Hooke]] theorized that this was simply because the species lived in the deep ocean and no one had discovered them yet.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; While he contended that  it was possible a species could be "lost", he thought this highly unlikely.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Similarly, in 1695, [[Thomas Molyneux]] published an account of enormous antlers found in [[Ireland]] that did not belong to any extant taxa in that area.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molyneux|first=Thomas|date=1695-01-01|title=A Discourse Concerning the Large Horns Frequently Found under Ground in Ireland, Concluding from Them That the Great American Deer, Call'd a Moose, Was Formerly Common in That Island: With Remarks on Some Other Things Natural to That Country.

When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted, scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply "hiding" in unexplored regions of the Earth.&lt;ref name="Watson2"&gt;''Ideas: A History from Fire to Freud'' ([[Peter Watson (business writer)|Peter Watson]] Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson {{ISBN|0-297-60726-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Cuvier]] is credited with establishing the modern conception of extinction in a 1796 lecture to the [[French Institute]],&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt; though he would spend most of his career trying to convince the wider scientific community of his theory.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912273245|title=Perilous planet earth : catastrophes and catastrophism through the ages|last=Trevor.|first=Palmer,|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521819288|oclc=912273245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier was a well-regarded geologist, lauded for his ability to reconstruct the anatomy of an unknown species from a few fragments of bone.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; His primary evidence for extinction came from mammoth skulls found in the [[Paris Basin|Paris basin]].&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Cuvier recognized them as distinct from any known living species of elephant, and argued that it was highly unlikely such an enormous animal would go undiscovered.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; In 1812, Cuvier, along with [[Alexandre Brongniart|Alexandre Bronigniart]] &amp; [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], mapped the [[Stratum|strata]] of the Paris basin.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They saw alternating saltwater and freshwater deposits, as well as patterns of the appearance and disappearance of fossils throughout the record.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; From these patterns, Cuvier inferred historic cycles of catastrophic flooding, extinction, and repopulation of the earth with new species.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

Cuvier's fossil evidence showed that very different life forms existed in the past than those that exist today, a fact that was accepted by most scientists.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The primary debate focused whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Cuvier understood extinction to be the result of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species, as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45730036|title=Georges Cuvier, fossil bones, and geological catastrophes : new translations &amp; interpretations of the primary texts|last=S.|first=Rudwick, M. J.|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226731063|oclc=45730036}}&lt;/ref&gt; His catastrophic view of the nature of extinction garnered him many opponents in the newly emerging school of [[uniformitarianism]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Jean-Baptist Lamarck]], a [[Gradualism|gradualist]] and colleague of Cuvier, saw the fossils of different life forms as evidence of the mutable character of species.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; While Lamarck did not deny the possibility of extinction, he believed that it was exceptional and rare and that most of the change in species over time was due to gradual change.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Unlike Cuvier, Lamarck was skeptical that catastrophic events of a scale large enough to cause total extinction were possible. In his geological history of the earth titled Hydrogeologie, Lamarck instead argued that the surface of the earth was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water, and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898833548|title=The age of Lamarck : evolutionary theories in France, 1790–1830|last=Renato)|first=Mandelbaum, Jonathan (Jonathan|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520058309|oclc=898833548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell]], a noted geologist and founder of [[uniformitarianism]], believed that past processes should be understood using present day processes. Like Lamarck, Lyell acknowledged that extinction could occur, noting the total extinction of the [[dodo]] and the extirpation of [[History of the horse in Britain|indigenous horses]] to the British Isles.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; He similarly argued against [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]], believing that any extinction must be a gradual process.&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Lyell also showed that Cuvier's original interpretation of the Parisian strata was incorrect. Instead of the catastrophic floods inferred by Cuvier, Lyell demonstrated that patterns of saltwater and freshwater [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]], like those seen in the [[Paris Basin|Paris basin]], could be formed by a slow rise and fall of [[sea level]]s.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The concept of extinction was integral to [[Charles Darwin]]’s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', with less fit lineages disappearing over time. For Darwin, extinction was a constant side effect of [[Competition (biology)|competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/16/the-lost-world-2|title=The Lost World|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the wide reach of ''On the Origin of Species'', it was widely accepted that extinction occurred gradually and evenly (a concept we now refer to as [[Background extinction rate|background extinction]]).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; It was not until 1982, when [[David M. Raup|David Raup]] and [[Jack Sepkoski]] published their seminal paper on mass extinctions, that Cuvier was vindicated and catastrophic extinction was accepted as an important mechanism. The current understanding of extinction is a synthesis of the cataclysmic extinction events proposed by Cuvier, and the background extinction events proposed by Lyell and Darwin.

== Human attitudes and interests ==
Extinction is an important research topic in the field of [[zoology]], and [[biology]] in general, and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community. A number of organizations, such as the [[WWF (conservation organization)|Worldwide Fund for Nature]], have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction. [[Government]]s have attempted, through enacting laws, to avoid habitat destruction, agricultural over-harvesting, and [[pollution]]. While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental, humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species, such as dangerous [[virus]]es, and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested.  Other species were deliberately driven to extinction, or nearly so, due to poaching or because they were "undesirable", or to push for other human agendas.  One example was the near extinction of the [[American bison]], which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government, to force the removal of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], many of whom relied on the bison for food.&lt;ref name="Kotzman"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. Cormack Gates |author2=Curtis H. Freese |author3=Peter J.P.

Biologist Bruce Walsh of the [[University of Arizona]] states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species: genetic resources, ecosystem stability, and [[ethics]];&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt; and today the scientific community "stress[es] the importance" of maintaining biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;Walsh, Bruce.

In modern times, commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life. However, some technologies with minimal, or no, proven harmful effects on ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' can be devastating to wildlife (for example, [[DDT]]).&lt;ref name="INCHEM"&gt;International Programme on Chemical Safety (1989).

Governments sometimes see the loss of native species as a loss to [[ecotourism]],&lt;ref name="Drewry"&gt;Drewry, Rachel.

People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment, leaving them highly exposed to extinction [[risk]]s. However, people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation; with [[human overpopulation]] in tropical [[developing country|developing countries]], there has been enormous pressure on forests due to [[subsistence agriculture]], including [[slash-and-burn]] agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Anne | last1= Ehrlich | title = Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species | publisher= Random House, New York | year= 1981 | isbn= 0-394-51312-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antinatalist]] philosopher [[David Benatar]] concludes that any popular concern about non-human species extinction usually arises out of concern about how the loss of a species will impact human wants and needs, that "we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal." He notes that typical concerns about possible human extinction, such as the loss of individual members, are not considered in regards to non-human species extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Benatar|first=David|date=2008 |title=Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence|url= |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=197 |isbn=978-0199549269|quote=It is noteworthy that human concern about human extinction takes a different form from human concern (where there is any) about the extinction of non-human species. Most humans who are concerned about the extinction of non-human species are not concerned about the individual animals whose lives are cut short in the passage to extinction, even though that is one of the best reasons to be concerned about extinction (at least in its killing form). The popular concern about animal extinction is usually concern for humans –- that we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal. In other words, none of the typical concerns about human extinction are applied to non-human species extinction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dracunculus medinensis]]'', a parasitic worm which causes the disease [[dracunculiasis]], is now close to eradication thanks to efforts led by the [[Carter Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3680439/guinea-worm-almost-extinct/ |title=This Species is Close to Extinction and That's a Good Thing |date=23 January 2015 |publisher=Time |accessdate=17 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Treponema pallidum|Treponema pallidum pertenue]]'', a bacterium which causes the disease [[yaws]], is in the process of being eradicated.

Biologist [[Olivia Judson]] has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying [[mosquito]] species. In a September 25, 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', she advocated "specicide" of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene, to create [[recessive]] "[[Gene knockout|knockout genes]]".&lt;ref name="Judson"/&gt; She says that the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[malaria]]) and ''[[Aedes]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[dengue fever]], [[yellow fever]], [[elephantiasis tropica|elephantiasis]], and other diseases) represent only 30 species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum, at a cost of reducing the [[genetic diversity]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Culicidae]] by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct "all the time" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the [[ecosystem]]: "We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species—but different need not mean worse." In addition, anti-malarial and [[Mosquito#Control|mosquito control programs]] offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in [[developing nation]]s who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail: "We should consider the ultimate swatting."&lt;ref name="Judson"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/25/opinion/a-bug-s-death.html |title=A Bug's Death |date=September 25, 2003 |author=Olivia Judson |publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=17 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] has advocated the eradication of several species of mosquito, including malaria vector ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]''. Wilson stated, "I'm talking about a very small number of species that have co-evolved with us and are preying on humans, so it would certainly be acceptable to remove them. I believe it's just common sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-04-04/why-famous-biologist-wants-eradicate-killer-mosquitoes| title=Why a famous biologist wants to eradicate killer mosquitoes|publisher=PRI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cloning ===
{{Main|De-extinction}}
Some, such as Harvard geneticist [[George M. Church]], believe that ongoing technological advances will let us "bring back to life" an extinct species by [[Cloning#Cloning extinct and endangered species|cloning]], using [[DNA]] from the remains of that species. Proposed targets for cloning include the [[mammoth]], the [[thylacine]], and the [[Pyrenean ibex]]. For this to succeed, enough individuals would have to be cloned, from the DNA of different individuals (in the case of sexually reproducing organisms) to create a viable population. Though [[bioethics|bioethical]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] objections have been raised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/24/news/mn-4250/2 |title= Cloned Goat Would Revive Extinct Line |author= A.

"This is something that could work, though it will be tedious and expensive," ''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, scientists tried to clone the extinct Pyrenean ibex (''C. p. pyrenaica''). This attempt failed: of the 285 embryos reconstructed, 54 were transferred to 12 mountain goats and [[mountain goat]]-[[Goat|domestic goat]] hybrids, but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they too died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/cloned-goat-dies-after-attempt-to-bring-species-back-from-extinction-1522974.html |title= Cloned goat dies after attempt to bring species back from extinction |author= Steve Connor |date= 2009-02-02 |work= [[The Independent]]   |accessdate=2010-05-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a second attempt was made to clone the Pyrenean ibex: one clone was born alive, but died seven minutes later, due to physical defects in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=31 Jan 2009|location=London|first1=Richard|last1=Gray|first2=Roger|last2=Dobson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quintilian Development==
The art of facilitas was most notably taught by [[Quintilian]], the Roman rhetorician, in the latter part of the first century A.D. (c. 35 – c. 100).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pearltrees.com/#/N-f=1_6721279&amp;N-fa=5997373&amp;N-p=62584516&amp;N-play=0&amp;N-s=1_6721279&amp;N-u=1_789406&lt;/ref&gt; In Quintilian's [[Institutio Oratoria]], Quintilian summarizes the Roman educational system. In this system, students, generally young boys, were trained daily from the age of six to about eighteen. There were two levels of masters who taught the children: the grammaticus, who helped children with imitations, speaking and writing exercises, and the rhetor, who prepared students for the final stage of declamation, when they gave fictitious speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, J.J. (1996). Quintilian. In T. Enos (Ed.), Encyclopedia of rhetoric and composition: Communication from ancient times to the information age (581–585). New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of Quintilian’s curriculum was for men to have facilitas: the ability to speak extemporaneously on any subject at any time.&lt;ref&gt;Bourelle, Andrew.

{{Sex (biology) sidebar|state=collapsed}}
'''Gametogenesis''' is a [[biology|biological]] process by which [[diploid]] or [[haploid]] [[precursor cell]]s undergo [[cell division]] and differentiation to form mature haploid [[gamete]]s. Depending on the [[biological life cycle]] of the [[organism]], gametogenesis occurs by [[meiosis|meiotic]] division of diploid [[gametocyte]]s into various gametes, or by mitosis. For example, [[plants]] produce gametes through mitosis in gametophytes. The gametophytes grow from haploid spores after sporic meiosis. The existence of a multicellular, haploid phase in the life cycle between meiosis and gametogenesis is also referred to as [[alternation of generations]].

==In Animals==
[[File:Gray's 7 (ovum maturation).svg|thumb|400px|Scheme showing analogies in the process of maturation of the ovum and the developmental to make any photo in Gujarati the developments and I am not of the service of the spermatids, following their individual pathways. The oocytes and spermatocytes are both gametocytes. Ova and spermatids are complete gametes. In reality, the first polar body typically dies without dividing.]]
Animals produce gametes directly through meiosis in organs called [[gonad]]s ([[testis]] in males and [[ovaries]] in females). [[Male]]s and [[female]]s of a species that [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]] have different forms of gametogenesis:

* '''[[spermatogenesis]]''' (male)
* '''[[oogenesis]]''' (female)

===Stages===
However, before turning into gametogonia, the embryonic development of gametes is the same in males and females.

====Common path====
Gametogonia are usually seen as the initial stage of gametogenesis. However, gametogonia are themselves successors of primordial germ cells (PGCs) from the dorsal [[endoderm]] of the [[yolk sac]] migrate along the hindgut to the [[gonadal ridge]]. They multiply by [[mitosis]], and, once they have reached the gonadal ridge in the late embryonic stage, are referred to as gametogonia.  Once the germ cells have developed into gametogonia, they are no longer the same between males and females.

====Individual path====
From gametogonia, male and female gametes develop differently - males by spermatogenesis and females by oogenesis. However, by convention, the following pattern is common for both:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Cell type''' || '''[[ploidy]]/[[chromosomes]] in humans''' || '''DNA copy number/[[chromatids]] in human'''&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Sources are mixed when using this system of numbering. Some sources use the chromatid number when writing "n" rather than the ploidy number. Hence gametogonium and primary gametocyte would be "4n" rather than "2n" with "4c" for copies.  The system used below has been determined by wikipedia consensus and should not necessarily be used as the definitive source on the issue.&lt;/ref&gt; || '''Process''' 
 |- 
 | [[gametogonium]] || diploid (2N)/46 || 2C before replication, 4C after / 46 before, 46 X 2 after|| [[gametocytogenesis (disambiguation)|gametocytogenesis]] (mitosis)
 |- 
 | primary gametocyte || diploid (2N)/46 || 2C before replication, 4C after / 46 before, 46 X 2 after || [[gametidogenesis]] ([[meiosis]] I)
 |- 
 | secondary gametocyte || haploid (N)/23 || 2C / 46|| gametidogenesis (meiosis II)
 |- 
 | [[gametid]] || haploid (N)/23  || C / 23|| 
 |- 
 | gamete || haploid (N)/23 || C / 23|| 
|}

===In vitro gametogenesis===
In vitro gametogenesis (IVG) is the technique of developing [[in vitro generated gametes]], i.e., "the generation of eggs and sperm from pluripotent stem cells in a culture dish."&lt;ref name="ivg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Glenn |last2=Daley |first2=George Q. |last3=Adashi | first3=Eli Y. |date=January 11, 2017 |title=Disruptive reproductive technologies |url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/372/eaag2959.full |journal=Science Translational Medicine |volume=9 |issue=372 |pages= |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.aag2959 |access-date=January 16, 2017 | quote=In vitro gametogenesis (IVG)—the generation of eggs and sperm from pluripotent stem cells in a culture dish. Currently feasible in mice, IVG is poised for future success in humans and promises new possibilities for the fields of reproductive and regenerative medicine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique is currently feasible in mice and will likely have future success in humans and nonhuman primates.&lt;ref name="ivg"/&gt;

==In gametangia==
Fungi, algae, and primitive plants form specialized haploid structures called [[gametangium|gametangia]], where gametes are produced through mitosis. In some fungi, such as the [[Zygomycota]], the gametangia are single cells, situated on the ends of [[hypha]]e, which act as gametes by fusing into a [[zygote]]. More typically, gametangia are multicellular structures that differentiate into male and female organs:

* '''[[antheridium]]''' (male)
* '''[[archegonium]]''' (female)

==In flowering plants==
In angiosperms, the male gametes (always two) are produced inside the pollen tube (in 70% of the species) or inside the [[pollen|pollen grain]] (in 30% of the species) through the division of a generative cell into two sperm nuclei. Depending on the species, this can occur while the pollen forms in the [[anther]] (pollen tricellular) or after [[pollination]] and growth of the [[pollen tube]] (pollen bicellular in the anther and in the stigma). The female gamete is produced inside the [[embryo sac]] of the [[ovule]].

==Meiosis==

[[Origin and function of meiosis|Meiosis]] is a central feature of gametogenesis, but the adaptive function of meiosis is currently a matter of debate.  A key event during meiosis is the pairing of [[homologous chromosomes]] and [[homologous recombination|recombination]] (exchange of genetic information) between homologous chromosomes.  This process promotes the production of increased genetic diversity among progeny and the recombinational repair of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|damage]] in the DNA to be passed on to progeny.  To explain the adaptive function of meiosis (as well as of gametogenesis and the sexual cycle), some authors emphasize diversity,&lt;ref name="pmid20576791"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harrison CJ, Alvey E, Henderson IR |title=Meiosis in flowering plants and other green organisms |journal=J. Exp. Bot. |volume=61 |issue=11 |pages=2863–75 |year=2010 |pmid=20576791 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erq191 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others emphasize [[DNA repair]]. &lt;ref name="pmid27605505"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mirzaghaderi G, Hörandl E |title=The evolution of meiotic sex and its alternatives |journal=Proc.

'''Graceland University''' is a private [[liberal arts university]] with campuses in [[Lamoni, Iowa|Lamoni]], [[Iowa]] and [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], [[Missouri]]. The university offers [[degree completion]] and [[master’s degree]] programs at [[satellite campus]]es in [[Centerville, Iowa|Centerville]] and [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]] and [[Trenton, Missouri]]. It also offers [[undergraduate]] and graduate programs online. The university was founded in 1895. Graceland was established by, and is affiliated with, the [[Community of Christ]], formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church). 

Graceland's main campus in Lamoni offers over 50 academic programs, including nine [[preprofessional]] programs and 35 undergraduate [[Major (academic)|majors]]. The residential campus also offers 19 [[varsity sports]], campus-wide activities and [[intramural sports]]. 

The Independence campus offers graduate and undergraduate programs in the School of Nursing and the Edmund J. Gleazer School of Education. The campus is also home to programs in the [[Community of Christ Seminary]]. [[John Sellars]] is Graceland's president. He assumed his role July 15, 2007.

==History==
Graceland University was established as Graceland College in 1895 by the RLDS Church in Lamoni, Iowa. Land for the college was donated by church members, with the first 20 acres given by [[Marietta Walker]]. The name "Graceland" was selected by Col. George Barrett, land surveyor for the college, for the graceful slope of the hill upon which the college was built. Until the administration building was completed, classes were conducted in a building in downtown Lamoni. The first day of classes was September 17, 1895. 

In 1917, Graceland received accreditation from the states of Iowa and Missouri and from the North Central Association of Colleges, making it the first fully accredited junior college in Iowa. Graceland became a four-year college in 1960. Graceland's nursing program began in 1910 as a cooperative program with the Independence Sanitarium and Hospital, Independence, MO. The Graceland campus was extended to Independence with the establishment of the college's bachelor's degree program in 1968-69.

The Graceland Partnership Program, offering degree-completion programs on community college campuses, was established in 1989. In 1995, Graceland acquired SkillPath, a business training company that offers seminars and classes. Graceland College became Graceland University on June 1, 2000.

==Chapel==
[[File:Cheville Chapel300.jpg|right|framed|Roy A. Cheville Chapel at Graceland University, Lamoni, Iowa, dedicated 1978]]The Cheville Chapel was dedicated in 1978 in honor of [[Roy Cheville]], theologian, educator and former [[Presiding Patriarch (Mormonism)|Presiding Patriarch]] of the [[Community of Christ]]. The structure was built for $325,000 and was funded by a restricted private bequest. In keeping with the desire for the [[chapel]] to be an accessible place of solitude, Graceland's president Frank Hough determined that the facility should remain unstaffed and open at all times.

The Chapel's relatively small [[seating capacity]] makes it an intimate setting for worship, theological education and the performance of [[sacred music]]. Known for its excellent [[acoustics]], it has been used for small ensemble performances. It is used several times a week by campus groups for [[worship]] services, and as a place of individual [[prayer]] and reflection. 

Architecturally, the [[postmodern]] brick structure is [[minimalist]] in its design. It is reminiscent of the exterior simplicity of the [[Rothko Chapel]] in Houston built only a few years earlier, while its twin [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]] foreshadows the [[deconstructivism]] style in architecture that began a decade later. The chapel houses Aaron Sherer's "The Process of Becoming," a canvas wall hanging employing a mix of colorfully painted ribbons.

==Student life==
=== Residence life ===
Instead of having fraternities and sororities like many universities, Graceland has residential social organizations called "Houses." These Houses are present on Graceland’s main campus; however, the Independence campus does have its own House, McKevit Manor. Students are assigned to a House regardless whether they live on or off campus. Graceland has six men’s Houses: Agape, Cheville, Closson, Faunce, Orion, and Stewart Manor. Graceland has nine female Houses: Amici, Aponivi, Dimora, Hanthorne, Khiyah, Paloma, Sariah, Shalom, and Solah.&lt;ref name=Lead&gt;[http://www.graceland.edu/Campus-Life/Leadership%20&amp;%20Service/index Campus Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126010217/http://www.graceland.edu/Campus-Life/Leadership%20%26%20Service/index |date=2012-11-26 }} "Leadership &amp; Service." Graceland University. N.p., n.d. Web. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each House has officers who serve on Graceland’s Student Government. The officers form a “House Council,” including a House President (who leads the House Council), a Campus Organization of Social Activities (COSA) representative, an Academic Student Council (ASC) representative, a senator, an intramural sports representative and a chaplain. Members of the House Council are elected to their positions by members of their House. In addition to their Student Government duties, House Council members plan social activities called “functions.” These functions vary by House and range from formal dinners to campouts.&lt;ref name=Lead/&gt;

Houses hold meetings every Tuesday at 10 p.m. Meetings are led by the House President and House Council and vary widely from House to House.&lt;ref name=Lead/&gt;

=== Activities and organizations ===
Graceland has over 50 clubs and organizations for students. Between Graceland Student Government and the campus clubs and organizations, over 250 official leadership positions are available.&lt;ref name=Orgs&gt;[http://www.graceland.edu/Campus-Life/Get-Involved/index Activities and Organizations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115174941/http://graceland.edu/Campus-Life/Get-Involved/index |date=2013-01-15 }} "Get Involved."

Graceland Student Government is a popular student activity, particularly for sophomore and junior students on campus.&lt;ref name=Orgs/&gt;

Intramurals is perhaps the campus’ most popular activity, with over 98 percent student participation. Intramural teams are divided by House and level of competition.&lt;ref name=Orgs/&gt;

Other popular student clubs include the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), International Club, Outreach International club, Enactus, Art Student Society and Sustainability Club.&lt;ref name=Orgs/&gt;

=== Performing arts ===
With the completion of the Shaw Center expansion in fall 2012, Graceland has placed a renewed emphasis on the performing arts. Graceland performance groups include Chamber Singers, Concert Choir, Oratorio Chorus, Jazz Band, Pep Band, Symphonic Band, Orchestra and Theatre. For the 2012-2013 academic year, Graceland doubled its number of annual theatre productions. Over 1/3 of Graceland student participate in the arts (both visual and performing).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graceland.edu/Academics/College-and-Schools/College-of-Liberal-Arts-and-Sciences/Division-of-Visual--Performing-Arts/index Performing Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107065614/http://www.graceland.edu/Academics/College-and-Schools/College-of-Liberal-Arts-and-Sciences/Division-of-Visual--Performing-Arts/index |date=2012-01-07 }} "Come express yourself at Graceland University."

=== School traditions ===
'''House Meeting'''

Every Tuesday at 10:00 p.m. student gather with their fellow House members in a weekly meeting. Meetings are led by the House President and involve House Council members. Meetings vary from House to House, but generally include recreational activities and announcements from House Council members. Meetings are generally held in House lounges.&lt;ref name=David&gt;Goehner, David. The Graceland College Book of Knowledge. Independence: Herald Publishing House, 1997. 168-69. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Airband'''

Every year at Graceland’s annual Homecoming weekend, COSA puts on an annual Airband competition. Male Houses are paired with female Houses (brother/sister Houses) and the teams compete against each other in a choreographed dance competition. Houses spend weeks preparing props, themes, and storylines for the competition; then perform their routine before a panel of judges. The winner of Airband is awarded points, and the team with the most Homecoming points wins money for their House.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;

'''New Years in November'''

Every year in mid-November, COSA sponsors a campuswide dance and celebration, called New Year’s in November. The event is essentially a celebration of the coming new year, because students are not on campus for New Year’s Eve. The event has a specific theme every year and includes dancing and other activities. The event traditionally ends with a pancake breakfast in the Commons.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;

'''Final Fling'''

The final weekend of the semester, COSA sponsors a campuswide celebration for students. Events vary year to year, but often include inflatables, sports tournaments, and various entertainment acts. Students collect wristbands for each event they attend, and at the weekend’s conclusion enter their wristbands in a drawing for prizes.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;

'''Thursday Night Movie'''

Once a week, COSA plays a free movie in the local theatre, The Coliseum. Before 2012, the movie played on Wednesdays; however the day was changed in fall 2012 to accommodate Graceland Student Government meetings.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;

'''[[Chemical engineering]]''' as a discipline that was developed out of those practising "industrial chemistry" in the late 19th century. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]] (18th century), industrial chemicals and other consumer products such as soap were mainly produced through [[Batch production|batch processing]]. Batch processing is labour-intensive and individuals mix predetermined amounts of ingredients in a vessel, heat, cool or pressurize the mixture for a predetermined length of time. The product may then be isolated, purified and tested to achieve a saleable product.  Batch processes are still performed today on higher value products, such as pharmaceutical intermediates, speciality and formulated products such as perfumes and paints, or in food manufacture such as pure maple syrups, where a profit can still be made despite batch methods being slower and inefficient in terms of labour and equipment usage.  Due to the application of Chemical Engineering techniques during manufacturing process development, larger volume [[chemical substances|chemicals]] are now produced through a [[Continuous production|continuous]] "assembly line" [[chemical process]]es. The [[Industrial Revolution]] was when a shift from batch to more continuous processing began to occur. Today [[commodity chemicals]] and [[petrochemicals]] are predominantly made using continuous manufacturing processes whereas [[speciality chemicals]], [[fine chemicals]] and [[pharmaceuticals]] are made using batch processes.

==Origin==
The Industrial Revolution led to an unprecedented escalation in demand, both with regard to quantity and quality, for bulk chemicals such as [[soda ash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kostick|first1=Dennis|title=The origin of the U.S. natural and synthetic soda ash industries|journal=Wyoming State Geological Survey Public Information Circular|date=1998|volume=39|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/soda_ash/soda-ash-industry.pdf|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This meant two things: one, the size of the activity and the efficiency of operation had to be enlarged, and two, serious alternatives to batch processing, such as continuous operation, had to be examined.

==The first chemical engineer==
Industrial chemistry was being practised in the mid 1800s, but it was not until the 1880s that the engineering elements required to control chemical processes were being recognized as a distinct professional activity. Chemical engineering was first established as a profession in the United Kingdom when the first chemical engineering course was given at the University of Manchester in 1887 by [[George E. Davis]] in the form of twelve lectures covering various aspects of industrial chemical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Delgass|publisher=Purdue University|title=Seventy-Five Years of Chemical Engineering|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/AboutUs/history.html|accessdate=13 August 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence [[George E. Davis]] is regarded as the world's first chemical engineer. Today, chemical engineering is a highly regarded profession. Chemical engineers with experience can become [[Regulation and licensure in engineering#United States|licensed Professional Engineers]] in the United States, aided by the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]], or gain "Chartered" chemical-engineer status through the UK-based [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]].

==Professional associations==
In 1880, the first attempt was made to form a ''Society of Chemical Engineers'' in London.  This eventually resulted in the formation of the [[Society of Chemical Industry]] in 1881. The [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] (AIChE) was founded in 1908, and the UK [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]] (IChemE) in 1922.&lt;ref name=Furter&gt;W. F. Furter (1980) A Century of Chemical Engineering, Plenum Press (NY &amp; London) {{ISBN|0-306-40895-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These both now have substantial international membership.  Some other countries now have chemical engineering societies or sections within chemical or engineering societies, but the AIChE, IChemE and IiChE remain the major ones in numbers and international spread: they are both open to suitably qualified professionals or students of chemical engineering anywhere in the world.

==Definitions==
For the other established branches of engineering, there were ready associations in the public's mind: [[Mechanical Engineering]] meant machines, [[Electrical Engineering]] meant circuitry, and [[Civil Engineering]] meant structures. Chemical engineering came to mean [[chemicals production]].

===Unit operation===
[[Arthur Dehon Little]] is credited with the approach chemical engineers to this day take: process-oriented rather than product-oriented analysis and design. The concept of [[Unit operation | unit operations]] was developed to emphasize the underlying similarity among seemingly different chemical productions. For example, the principles are the same whether one is concerned about separating alcohol from water in a fermenter, or separating gasoline from diesel in a refinery, as long as the basis of separation is generation of a vapor of a different composition from the liquid. Therefore, such separation processes can be studied together as a unit operation, in this case called [[distillation]].

===Unit processes===
In the early part of the last century, a parallel concept called [[unit processing|Unit Processes]] was used to classify reactive processes. Thus [[Redox|oxidation]]s, [[Redox|reduction]]s, [[alkylation]]s, etc. formed separate unit processes and were studied as such. This was natural considering the close affinity of chemical engineering to industrial chemistry at its inception. Gradually however, the subject of [[chemical reaction engineering]] has largely replaced the unit process concept. This subject looks at the entire body of chemical reactions as having a personality of its own, independent of the particular chemical species or chemical bonds involved. The latter does contribute to this personality in no small measure, but to design and operate chemical reactors, a knowledge of characteristics such as [[chemical kinetics|rate behaviour]], [[thermodynamics]], single or multiphase nature, etc. are more important.  The emergence of chemical reaction engineering as a discipline signaled the severance of the umbilical cord connecting chemical engineering to industrial chemistry and cemented the unique character of the discipline.

[[File:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant.jpg|thumb|upright=1.55|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Impression, soleil levant]]'' (''Impression, Sunrise''), 1872, oil on canvas, [[Musée Marmottan Monet]], [[Paris]]. This painting became the source of the movement's name, after [[Louis Leroy]]'s article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'' satirically implied that the painting was at most, a sketch.]]
'''Impressionism''' is a 19th-century [[art movement]] characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of ''movement'' as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent [[art exhibition|exhibitions]] brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.

The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a [[Claude Monet]] work, ''Impression, soleil levant'' (''[[Impression, Sunrise]]''), which provoked the critic [[Louis Leroy]] to [[word coinage|coin]] the term in a [[satire|satirical]] review published in the Parisian newspaper ''[[Le Charivari]]''.

The development of Impressionism in the [[visual arts]] was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as [[impressionist music]] and [[Impressionism (literature)|impressionist literature]].

==Overview==
[[File:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s atmospheric work was influential on the birth of Impressionism, here ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'' (1839)]]

Radicals in their time, early Impressionists violated the rules of academic painting. They constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours, following the example of painters such as [[Eugène Delacroix]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. They also painted realistic scenes of modern life, and often painted outdoors. Previously, [[still life]]s and [[portrait]]s as well as [[landscape art|landscapes]] were usually painted in a studio.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions include [[Canaletto#Outdoor painting|Canaletto]], who painted outside and may have used the [[camera obscura]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting outdoors or ''[[en plein air]]''. They portrayed overall visual effects instead of details, and used short "broken" brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour—not blended smoothly or shaded, as was customary—to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.

[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], ''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette ([[Bal du moulin de la Galette]])'', 1876, [[Musée d'Orsay]], one of Impressionism's most celebrated masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=AXdOAAAAYAAJ Ingo F. Walther, ''Masterpieces of Western Art: A History of Art in 900 Individual Studies from the Gothic to the Present Day, Part 1''], Centralibros Hispania Edicion y Distribucion, S.A., 1999, {{ISBN|3822870315}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Impressionism emerged in France at the same time that a number of other painters, including the Italian artists known as the [[Macchiaioli]], and [[Winslow Homer]] in the United States, were also exploring ''plein-air'' painting. The Impressionists, however, developed new techniques specific to the style. Encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing, it is an art of immediacy and movement, of candid poses and compositions, of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour.

The public, at first hostile, gradually came to believe that the Impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision, even if the art critics and art establishment disapproved of the new style.  By recreating the sensation in the eye that views the subject, rather than delineating the details of the subject, and by creating a welter of techniques and forms, Impressionism is a precursor of various painting styles, including [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Fauvism]], and [[Cubism]].

==Beginnings==
In the middle of the 19th century—a time of change, as Emperor [[Napoleon III]] rebuilt Paris and waged war—the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] dominated French art. The Académie was the preserver of traditional French painting standards of content and style. Historical subjects, religious themes, and portraits were valued; landscape and still life were not. The Académie preferred carefully finished images that looked realistic when examined closely. Paintings in this style were made up of precise brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist's hand in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Nathalia Brodskaya, Impressionism, Parkstone International, 2014, pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Colour was restrained and often toned down further by the application of a golden varnish.&lt;ref name="The Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/imml/hd_imml.htm Samu, Margaret. "Impressionism: Art and Modernity". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 (October 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Académie had an annual, juried art show, the [[Salon de Paris]], and artists whose work was displayed in the show won prizes, garnered commissions, and enhanced their prestige. The standards of the juries represented the values of the Académie, represented by the works of such artists as [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]].

In the early 1860s, four young painters—[[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Alfred Sisley]], and [[Frédéric Bazille]]—met while studying under the academic artist [[Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre|Charles Gleyre]]. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air,&lt;ref&gt;White, Harrison C., Cynthia A. White (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2D_ehhO_14QC&amp;pg=PA116 Canvases and Careers: Institutional Change in the French Painting World]''. University of Chicago Press. p. 116. {{ISBN|0226894878}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but not for the purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio, as was the usual custom.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 21–27.&lt;/ref&gt; By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the [[realism (arts)|Realism]] of [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school]]. A favourite meeting place for the artists was the [[Café Guerbois]] on Avenue de Clichy in Paris, where the discussions were often led by [[Édouard Manet]], whom the younger artists greatly admired. They were soon joined by [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Armand Guillaumin]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Taube G. "Armand Guillaumin", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Édouard Manet]], ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863]]
During the 1860s, the Salon jury routinely rejected about half of the works submitted by Monet and his friends in favour of works by artists faithful to the approved style.&lt;ref&gt;Seiberling, Grace, "Impressionism", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, the Salon jury rejected Manet's ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' ''([[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]])'' primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men at a picnic. While the Salon jury routinely accepted nudes in historical and allegorical paintings, they condemned Manet for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.133.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury's severely worded rejection of Manet's painting appalled his admirers, and the unusually large number of rejected works that year perturbed many French artists.

After Emperor Napoleon III saw the rejected works of 1863, he decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves, and the [[Salon des Refusés]] (Salon of the Refused) was organized. While many viewers came only to laugh, the Salon des Refusés drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art and attracted more visitors than the regular Salon.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.194.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alfred Sisley 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfred Sisley]], ''View of the Saint-Martin Canal, Paris'', 1870, [[Musée d'Orsay]]]]
Artists' petitions requesting a new Salon des Refusés in 1867, and again in 1872, were denied. In December 1873, [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Edgar Degas]] and several other artists founded the ''Société Anonyme Coopérative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs'' ("Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers") to exhibit their artworks independently.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford et al. 1990, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the association were expected to forswear participation in the Salon.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1994, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers invited a number of other progressive artists to join them in their inaugural exhibition, including the older [[Eugène Boudin]], whose example had first persuaded Monet to adopt ''plein air'' painting years before.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Another painter who greatly influenced Monet and his friends, [[Johan Jongkind]], declined to participate, as did [[Édouard Manet]]. In total, thirty artists participated in their first exhibition, held in April 1874 at the studio of the photographer [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]].

[[File:Claude Monet - Graystaks I.JPG|thumb|left|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks, (sunset)]]'', 1890–1891, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]
The critical response was mixed. Monet and Cézanne received the harshest attacks. Critic and humorist [[Louis Leroy]] wrote a scathing review in the newspaper ''Le Charivari'' in which, making wordplay with the title of Claude Monet's ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' ''(Impression, soleil levant)'', he gave the artists the name by which they became known. Derisively titling his article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'', Leroy declared that Monet's painting was at most, a sketch, and could hardly be termed a finished work.

He wrote, in the form of a dialog between viewers,
:''Impression—I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was impressed, there had to be some impression in it ... and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.''&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'' (Camille and Jean Monet), 1875, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The term ''Impressionist'' quickly gained favour with the public. It was also accepted by the artists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion. They exhibited together—albeit with shifting membership—eight times between 1874 and 1886. The Impressionists' style, with its loose, spontaneous brushstrokes, would soon become synonymous with modern life.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

Monet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be considered the "purest" Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour. Degas rejected much of this, as he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon; Forge (1988), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Renoir turned away from Impressionism for a time during the 1880s, and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas. Édouard Manet, although regarded by the Impressionists as their leader,&lt;ref&gt;Distel et al. (1974), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour (while Impressionists avoided its use and preferred to obtain darker colours by mixing), and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the Salon, where his painting ''Spanish Singer'' had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged the others to do likewise, arguing that "the Salon is the real field of battle" where a reputation could be made.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson (1976), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the artists of the core group (minus Bazille, who had died in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870), defections occurred as Cézanne, followed later by Renoir, Sisley, and Monet, abstained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their works to the Salon. Disagreements arose from issues such as Guillaumin's membership in the group, championed by Pissarro and Cézanne against opposition from Monet and Degas, who thought him unworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; Degas invited [[Mary Cassatt]] to display her work in the 1879 exhibition, but also insisted on the inclusion of [[Jean-François Raffaëlli]], [[Ludovic-Napoléon Lepic|Ludovic Lepic]], and other realists who did not represent Impressionist practices, causing Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists of "opening doors to first-come daubers".&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; The group divided over invitations to [[Paul Signac]] and [[Georges Seurat]] to exhibit with them in 1886. Pissarro was the only artist to show at all eight Impressionist exhibitions.

The individual artists achieved few financial rewards from the Impressionist exhibitions, but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance and support. Their dealer, [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Durand-Ruel]], played a major role in this as he kept their work before the public and arranged shows for them in London and New York. Although Sisley died in poverty in 1899, Renoir had a great Salon success in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Distel, Anne, Michel Hoog, and Charles S. Moffett. 1974. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dhc-U0t14vMC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq= ''Impressionism; a Centenary Exhibition, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 12, 1974–February 10, 1975'']. [New York]: [Metropolitan Museum of Art]. p. 190. {{ISBN|0870990977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Monet became secure financially during the early 1880s and so did Pissarro by the early 1890s. By this time the methods of Impressionist painting, in a diluted form, had become commonplace in Salon art.&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p. 475–476.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impressionist techniques==
[[File:Cassatt Mary At the Theater 1879.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Cassatt]], ''Lydia Leaning on Her Arms'' (in a theatre box), 1879]]
French painters who prepared the way for Impressionism include the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] colourist [[Eugène Delacroix]], the leader of the realists [[Gustave Courbet]], and painters of the [[Barbizon school]] such as [[Théodore Rousseau]]. The Impressionists learned much from the work of [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and [[Eugène Boudin]], who painted from nature in a direct and spontaneous style that prefigured Impressionism, and who befriended and advised the younger artists.

A number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style of the Impressionists. Although these methods had been used by previous artists—and are often conspicuous in the work of artists such as [[Frans Hals]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[John Constable]], and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Turner]]—the Impressionists were the first to use them all together, and with such consistency. These techniques include:

* Short, thick strokes of paint quickly capture the essence of the subject, rather than its details. The paint is often applied [[impasto]].
* Colours are applied side-by-side with as little mixing as possible, a technique that exploits the principle of [[simultaneous contrast]] to make the colour appear more vivid to the viewer.
* Grays and dark tones are produced by mixing [[complementary colour]]s. Pure impressionism avoids the use of black paint.
* [[Wet-on-wet|Wet paint is placed into wet paint]] without waiting for successive applications to dry, producing softer edges and intermingling of colour.
* Impressionist paintings do not exploit the transparency of thin paint films (glazes), which earlier artists manipulated carefully to produce effects. The impressionist painting surface is typically opaque.
* The paint is applied to a white or light-coloured ground. Previously, painters often used dark grey or strongly coloured grounds. 
* The play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colours from object to object. Painters often worked in the evening to produce ''[[effets de soir]]''—the shadowy effects of evening or twilight.
* In paintings made ''[[en plein air]]'' (outdoors), shadows are boldly painted with the blue of the sky as it is reflected onto surfaces, giving a sense of freshness previously not represented in painting. (Blue shadows on snow inspired the technique.)

New technology played a role in the development of the style. Impressionists took advantage of the mid-century introduction of premixed paints in tin tubes (resembling modern toothpaste tubes), which allowed artists to work more spontaneously, both outdoors and indoors.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, painters made their own paints individually, by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil, which were then stored in animal bladders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf Renoir and the Impressionist Process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105173433/http://phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf |date=2011-01-05 }}. ''[[The Phillips Collection]]'', retrieved May 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available to artists for the first time during the 19th century. These included [[cobalt blue]], [[viridian]], [[cadmium yellow]], and synthetic [[ultramarine blue]], all of which were in use by the 1840s, before Impressionism.&lt;ref name="Wallert_159"/&gt; The Impressionists' manner of painting made bold use of these pigments, and of even newer colours such as [[cerulean blue]],&lt;ref name="The Met"/&gt; which became commercially available to artists in the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Wallert_159"&gt;Wallert, Arie; Hermens, Erma; Peek, Marja (1995). [https://books.google.com/books?id=pdFOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq= ''Historical painting techniques, materials, and studio practice: preprints of a symposium, University of Leiden, Netherlands, 26-29 June, 1995'']. [Marina Del Rey, Calif.]: Getty Conservation Institute. p. 159. {{ISBN|0892363223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Impressionists' progress toward a brighter style of painting was gradual. During the 1860s, Monet and Renoir sometimes painted on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground.&lt;ref name="Hill_177"&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill; Rushfield, Rebecca Anne (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1msM3h9mbaoC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq= ''The conservation of easel paintings''. London: Routledge. p. 177]. {{ISBN|1136000410}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro usually chose to paint on grounds of a lighter grey or beige colour, which functioned as a middle tone in the finished painting.&lt;ref name="Hill_177"/&gt; By the 1880s, some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white or slightly off-white grounds, and no longer allowed the ground colour a significant role in the finished painting.&lt;ref&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill; Rushfield, Rebecca Anne (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1msM3h9mbaoC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq= ''The conservation of easel paintings''. London: Routledge. p. 178]. {{ISBN|1136000410}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and composition==
[[File:Hay Harvest at Éragny, 1901, Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Hay Harvest at Éragny,'' 1901, [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]]]]
Prior to the Impressionists, other painters, notably such [[Dutch Golden Age painting|17th-century Dutch painters]] as [[Jan Steen]], had emphasized common subjects, but their methods of [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] were traditional. They arranged their compositions so that the main subject commanded the viewer's attention. The Impressionists relaxed the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an Impressionist painting often resembles a snapshot, a part of a larger reality captured as if by chance.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum (1989), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Photography]] was gaining popularity, and as cameras became more portable, photographs became more candid. Photography inspired Impressionists to represent momentary action, not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape, but in the day-to-day lives of people.&lt;ref&gt;Varnedoe, J. Kirk T. ''The Artifice of Candor: Impressionism and Photography Reconsidered'', Art in America 68, January 1980, pp. 66-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Robert L. ''Impressionism: Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society'', Yale University Press, 1988, pp. 311, 319 {{ISBN|0300050836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berthe Morisot Reading.jpg|thumb|left|[[Berthe Morisot]], ''Reading,'' 1873, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]]]
The development of Impressionism can be considered partly as a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by photography, which seemed to devalue the artist's skill in reproducing reality. Both portrait and [[Landscape art|landscape]] paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography "produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably".&lt;ref name = "impressionism757"/&gt;

In spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists focused "on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph—by further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the image, the very subjectivity that photography eliminated".&lt;ref name = "impressionism757"/&gt; The Impressionists sought to express their perceptions of nature, rather than create exact representations. This allowed artists to depict subjectively what they saw with their "tacit imperatives of taste and conscience".&lt;ref name="impressionism758"&gt;Sontag, Susan (1977) On Photography, Penguin, London&lt;/ref&gt; Photography encouraged painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium, like colour, which photography then lacked: "The Impressionists were the first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph".&lt;ref name="impressionism757"&gt;Levinson, Paul (1997) ''The Soft Edge; a Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution'', Routledge, London and New York&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Claude Monet - Jardin à Sainte-Adresse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Garden at Sainte-Adresse|Jardin à Sainte-Adresse]],'' 1867, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/437133?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ao=on&amp;ft=Claude+Monet&amp;pos=1 Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; a work showing the influence of Japanese prints]]
Another major influence was Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] art prints ([[Japonism]]). The art of these prints contributed significantly to the "snapshot" angles and unconventional compositions that became characteristic of Impressionism. An example is Monet's ''Jardin à Sainte-Adresse'', 1867, with its bold blocks of colour and composition on a strong diagonal slant showing the influence of Japanese prints&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kLEpf5a49V0C&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=Terrasse+%C3%A0+Sainte-Adresse+japanese+prints&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dwnPUtm_GKnNsQTV-4KIDA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Terrasse%20%C3%A0%20Sainte-Adresse%20japanese%20prints&amp;f=false Gary Tinterow, Origins of Impressionism, Metropolitan Museum of Art,1994, page 433]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Degas]] was both an avid photographer and a collector of Japanese prints.&lt;ref&gt;Baumann; Karabelnik, et al. (1994), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''The Dance Class'' ''(La classe de danse)'' of 1874 shows both influences in its asymmetrical composition. The dancers are seemingly caught off guard in various awkward poses, leaving an expanse of empty floor space in the lower right quadrant. He also captured his dancers in sculpture, such as the ''[[Little Dancer of Fourteen Years]]''.

==Associates and influenced artists==
[[File:James Abbot McNeill Whistler 012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket]]'', 1874, [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]]]
Among the close associates of the Impressionists were several painters who adopted their methods to some degree. These include [[Jean-Louis Forain]] (who participated in Impressionist exhibitions in 1879, 1880, 1881 and 1886)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/joconde/fr/decouvrir/expositions/impressionnisme/theme_imprart.htm|title=Joconde : catalogue collectif des collections des musées de France|website=www.culture.gouv.fr|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Giuseppe De Nittis]], an Italian artist living in Paris who participated in the first Impressionist exhibit at the invitation of Degas, although the other Impressionists disparaged his work.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.152.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federico Zandomeneghi]] was another Italian friend of Degas who showed with the Impressionists. [[Eva Gonzalès]] was a follower of Manet who did not exhibit with the group. [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] was an American-born painter who played a part in Impressionism although he did not join the group and preferred grayed colours. [[Walter Sickert]], an English artist, was initially a follower of Whistler, and later an important disciple of Degas; he did not exhibit with the Impressionists. In 1904 the artist and writer [[Wynford Dewhurst]] wrote the first important study of the French painters published in English, ''Impressionist Painting: its genesis and development'', which did much to popularize Impressionism in Great Britain.

By the early 1880s, Impressionist methods were affecting, at least superficially, the art of the Salon. Fashionable painters such as [[Jean Béraud]] and [[Henri Gervex]] found critical and financial success by brightening their palettes while retaining the smooth finish expected of Salon art.&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p.476–477.&lt;/ref&gt; Works by these artists are sometimes casually referred to as Impressionism, despite their remoteness from Impressionist practice.

The influence of the French Impressionists lasted long after most of them had died. Artists like [[Jesekiel David Kirszenbaum|J.D. Kirszenbaum]] were borrowing Impressionist techniques throughout the twentieth century.

==Beyond France==
[[File:Serov devochka s persikami.jpg|thumb|''[[Girl with Peaches|The Girl with Peaches]]'' (1887, [[Tretyakov Gallery]]) by [[Valentin Serov]]]]
[[File:Arthur Streeton - Golden summer, Eaglemont - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Streeton]]'s 1889 landscape ''[[Golden Summer, Eaglemont]]'', held at the [[National Gallery of Australia]], is an example of [[Heidelberg School|Australian impressionism]].]]

As the influence of Impressionism spread beyond France, artists, too numerous to list, became identified as practitioners of the new style. Some of the more important examples are:
* The [[American Impressionism|American Impressionists]], including [[Mary Cassatt]], [[William Merritt Chase]], [[Frederick Carl Frieseke]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Willard Metcalf]], [[Lilla Cabot Perry]], [[Theodore Robinson]], [[Edmund C. Tarbell|Edmund Charles Tarbell]], [[John Henry Twachtman]], [[Catherine Wiley]] and [[J. Alden Weir]].
* The [[Australian Impressionism|Australian Impressionists]], including [[Tom Roberts]], [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Walter Withers]], [[Charles Conder]] and [[Frederick McCubbin]] (who were prominent members of the [[Heidelberg School]]), and [[John Peter Russell]], a friend of Van Gogh, Rodin, Monet and Matisse.
* The [[Amsterdam Impressionism|Amsterdam Impressionists]] in the [[Netherlands]], including [[George Hendrik Breitner]], [[Isaac Israëls]], [[Willem Bastiaan Tholen]], [[Willem de Zwart]], [[Willem Witsen]] and [[Jan Toorop]].

* [[László Mednyánszky]] in Hungary
* [[Theodor von Ehrmanns]] and [[Hugo Charlemont]] who were rare Impressionists among the more dominant [[Vienna Secessionist]] painters in Austria
* [[William John Leech]], [[Roderic O'Conor]], and [[Walter Osborne]] in Ireland

* [[Ásgrímur Jónsson]] in [[Iceland]]
* [[Fujishima Takeji]] in [[Japan]]
* [[Frits Thaulow]] in [[Norway]] and later France.

==Sculpture, photography and film==
The sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] is sometimes called an Impressionist for the way he used roughly modeled surfaces to suggest transient light effects.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S., and Helen Gardner (2014). ''Gardner's art through the ages: a concise Western history''. Boston, MA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning. p. 382. {{ISBN|9781133954798}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pictorialism|Pictorialist]] photographers whose work is characterized by soft focus and atmospheric effects have also been called Impressionists.

[[French Impressionist Cinema]] is a term applied to a loosely defined group of films and filmmakers in France from 1919–1929, although these years are debatable. French Impressionist filmmakers include [[Abel Gance]], [[Jean Epstein]], [[Germaine Dulac]], Marcel L’Herbier, [[Louis Delluc]], and Dmitry Kirsanoff.

Musical Impressionism is the name given to a movement in [[European classical music]] that arose in the late 19th century and continued into the middle of the 20th century. Originating in France, musical Impressionism is characterized by suggestion and atmosphere, and eschews the emotional excesses of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]]. Impressionist composers favoured short forms such as the [[nocturne]], [[Arabesque (classical music)|arabesque]], and [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], and often explored uncommon scales such as the [[whole tone scale]]. Perhaps the most notable innovations of Impressionist composers were the introduction of major 7th chords and the extension of chord structures in 3rds to five- and six-part harmonies.

The influence of visual Impressionism on its musical counterpart is debatable. [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]] are generally considered the greatest Impressionist composers, but Debussy disavowed the term, calling it the invention of critics. [[Erik Satie]] was also considered in this category, though his approach was regarded as less serious, more musical novelty in nature. [[Paul Dukas]] is another French composer sometimes considered an Impressionist, but his style is perhaps more closely aligned to the late Romanticists. Musical Impressionism beyond France includes the work of such composers as [[Ottorino Respighi]] (Italy) [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Cyril Scott]], and [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] (England), and [[Manuel De Falla]], and [[Isaac Albeniz]] (Spain).

The term Impressionism has also been used to describe works of literature in which a few select details suffice to convey the sensory impressions of an incident or scene. Impressionist literature is closely related to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], with its major exemplars being [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]], [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], and [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]. Authors such as [[Virginia Woolf]], [[D.H. Lawrence]], and [[Joseph Conrad]] have written works that are Impressionistic in the way that they describe, rather than interpret, the impressions, sensations and emotions that constitute a character's mental life.

==Post-Impressionism==
{{Main|Post-Impressionism}}
Post-Impressionism developed from Impressionism. During the 1880s several artists began to develop different precepts for the use of colour, pattern, form, and line, derived from the Impressionist example: [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. These artists were slightly younger than the Impressionists, and their work is known as post-Impressionism. Some of the original Impressionist artists also ventured into this new territory; [[Camille Pissarro]] briefly painted in a [[Pointillism|pointillist]] manner, and even Monet abandoned strict ''plein air'' painting. [[Paul Cézanne]], who participated in the first and third Impressionist exhibitions, developed a highly individual vision emphasising pictorial structure, and he is more often called a post-Impressionist. Although these cases illustrate the difficulty of assigning labels, the work of the original Impressionist painters may, by definition, be categorised as Impressionism.

'''''Kids Can Say No!''''', stylized as '''''Kids Can Say &lt;u&gt;No&lt;/u&gt;''','' is a 1985 [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] [[Short film|short]] [[educational film]] produced and directed by Jessica Skippon and written by Anita Bennett. It is intended to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be [[Sexual abuse|sexually abused]], how to escape such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. In the film, Australian celebrity [[Rolf Harris]] is in a park with a group of four children and tells them about proper and improper [[physical intimacy]], which he calls "yes" and "no" feelings. The film has four [[role-playing]] scenes in which children encounter [[Pedophilia|paedophiles]], with Harris and the children discussing each scene.

Harris said that he came up with the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw [[Vancouver]]'s [[Green Thumb Theatre]] production of ''[[Feeling Yes, Feeling No]]'', a play about [[child sexual abuse]]. ''Kids Can Say No!'', released in October 1985 on [[VHS]] in the United Kingdom, was the first British [[children's film]] about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, ''[[The Times]]'' obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using ''Kids Can Say No!'' or any other film to teach children about the subject. The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of ''Kids Can Say No!'' and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel ''Beyond the Scare'', which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of ''Kids Can Say No!'' eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.

''Kids Can Say No!'' resurfaced in 2014, when Harris was prosecuted for twelve counts of [[indecent assault|indecently assaulting]] young girls. The prosecutors found ''Kids Can Say No!'' on [[YouTube]] and wanted to show it at trial to illustrate its unintentional irony, but the film was not [[Admissible evidence|admitted as evidence]]. Harris was found guilty of all counts. During the trial, it was learned that, while Harris was filming ''Kids Can Say No!'', he was in the midst of a [[casual sex]]ual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend and, by its release, he had committed nine of the twelve assaults. According to Richard Guilliatt and [[Jacquelin Magnay]] in an article in ''[[The Australian]]'', Harris' campaign against paedophilia in ''Kids Can Say No!'' can "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

Harris, then host of ''[[Rolf's Cartoon Time]]'', approached the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] (NSPCC) and the [[Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust|Tavistock Clinic]] with his idea about making a film on child [[sexual abuse]]. Both organisations were receptive.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use [[child actor]]s in ''Kids Can Say No!''&lt;ref name=Twomey&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Daily Express]]|title=Hypocrisy: Rolf Harris Warned of Paedophiles in Children's Charity Video|author=Twomey, John|date=1 June 2014|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/485939/Rolf-Harris-warned-of-paedophiles-in-children-s-charity-video|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris approached [[Film director|director]] Jessica Skippon, with whom he had made a film about water safety,&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; and said that he wanted to make ''Kids Can Say No!'' to protect children.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt; Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

In April 1986, Harris met with [[Western Australia Police]] officials and members of several state-government departments in [[Mount Hawthorn, Western Australia|Mount Hawthorn]] to propose another film for children about how to handle [[sexual predator]]s. Despite Harris' offer to work for free, the officials declined and instead developed a broader campaign on the subject without Harris.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

==Release==
[[File:Sydney Opera House (9587195189).jpg|thumb|alt=Sydney Opera House|[[Child abuse|Child-abuse]] expert Carolyn Okell Jones presented ''Kids Can Say No!'' at the [[Sydney Opera House]] (''pictured'') in 1986 as part of the sixth [[International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect|International Congress on Child Abuse and Neglect]].]]
''Kids Can Say No!'' was released in the United Kingdom in October 1985&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; on [[VHS]]&lt;ref name=Jefferson/&gt; with notes for teachers and two relevant books,&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; and was distributed by Skippon Video, Skippon's UK-based company.&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; Although several other short children's educational films about sexual abuse were on the market in the UK including several also released that year, ''Kids Can Say No!'' was the only British film; the others were made in Australia, Canada and the United States.&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt;

In August 1986, Jones presented the film at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in Australia as part of the sixth [[International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect|International Congress on Child Abuse and Neglect]], the largest conference in the world on child abuse. The 56-year-old Harris, who was chosen to be [[master of ceremonies]] for the three-day conference's opening event because of his celebrity and involvement with the film, told the audience that paedophilia was finally "coming out from under its veil of secrecy".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Australian]]|title=The Dark Double Life of Rolf Harris|author=Guilliatt, Richard|author2=[[Jacquelin Magnay]]|date=12 July 2014|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/the-dark-double-life-of-rolf-harris/story-e6frg8h6-1226981773650|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequel===
After the release of ''Kids Can Say No!'', many teachers who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of how to deal with the disclosures,&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel&lt;ref name=Beal/&gt; ''Beyond the Scare''.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; ''Kids Can Say No!'' encourages children to report abuse they experience and ''Beyond the Scare'' advises teachers about what to do if a child makes such a disclosure.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

''Beyond the Scare'', filmed in a [[North London]] school, consists of role-playing scenes with actual teachers. The film instructs teachers to listen to the child, to discuss the incident with the child's parents and to contact the appropriate authorities. The Tavistock Clinic helped with the film's production, and an expert from the organisation appears on-camera to promote [[child protection]] projects in schools. Although Harris appears in ''Beyond the Scare'', his role is less prominent than in ''Kids Can Say No!''&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=The Importance of Listening: The Issue of Child Sex Abuse|date=7 October 1986|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=40GH-HB00-00VY-8177&amp;csi=270944,270077,11059,8411&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true|accessdate=25 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his activism against child abuse ended soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

[[File:Rolf Harris.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Rolf Harris|In 2014, Harris was convicted of twelve counts of [[indecent assault]] against four young girls, having committed nine counts before the 1985 release of ''Kids Can Say No!'']]
''Kids Can Say No!'' resurfaced in 2014 when Harris, then 83 years old, was prosecuted for twelve counts of [[indecent assault]] between 1968 and 1986 against four young girls; the youngest was seven years old. The prosecutors found ''Kids Can Say No!'' on [[YouTube]] and wanted to show it at trial for its unintentional irony, but the film was ruled irrelevant to the case and not [[Admissible evidence|admitted as evidence]].&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt;

After the trial began, Skippon warned media outlets that it was illegal to use the film without written permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|title=Rolf Harris Starred in Video about Protecting Children in 1980s|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/rolf-harris-starred-in-video-about-protecting-children-in-1985-9573633.html|first=Paul|last=Cheston|date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director wrote to ''[[The Independent]]'' that no complaints were made against Harris during the making of the film.&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt; In an article about the allegations against Harris, ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' noted that ''Kids Can Say No!'' was commissioned by the NSPCC;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|title=BBC Sex Scandal: A Gifted Entertainer who was Nervous of Groupies|author=Flint, John|date=21 April 2013|page=17|url=https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&amp;NS=16&amp;AID=9UNI002400&amp;an=SUNTEL0020130421e94l00066&amp;cat=a&amp;ep=ASI|accessdate=24 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; a NSPCC spokesperson responded, "The film was made independently by Rolf Harris and a film company nearly 30 years ago&amp;nbsp;...

==Reception==
Reviews of ''Kids Can Say No!'' have generally been negative, with initial reviews doubting the benefit of showing the film to children and later reviews focusing on Harris' hypocrisy. In a 1985 ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review, Caroline Moorehead writes that the film's avoidance of an explicit discussion of sexual abuse was both a requirement and the film's greatest weakness. According to Moorehead, an explicit discussion might have terrified children and prevented parents from consenting to their children's viewing of the film; however, its oblique approach prevents children from understanding the issue. She calls the film's theme song "catchy, one of those irritating snatches of music that is hard to forget".&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt;

''The Times'' obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using ''Kids Can Say No!'' or any other film to teach children about the subject. [[Northampton]] [[social work]]er Helen Kenward said that she would not show the film to children. [[Psychiatrist]] Brendan McCarthy called it simplistic. According to teacher Clare Rankin, children under five would not understand the film. [[Physician]] Paula Drummond was concerned that it might inspire children to falsely accuse adults they disliked, although McCarthy said that children were unlikely to make false abuse accusations. McCarthy was especially critical of the film, calling it "no clearer to a child than the Gorbachev-Reagan talks".&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt; Moorehead summarised the experts' comments as suggesting that ''Kids Can Say No!'' is "muddling, evasive and pussy-footed, best not for children at all, but as&amp;nbsp;... aids for parents and professional workers to alert them to paedophilia and incest".&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt;

In a 1988 ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]]'' review, Judith Whelan writes that Harris is more serious in the film than he was when performing "[[Jake the Peg]]". According to Whelan, the film "would best be seen by children in a group, with an adult (teacher or parent) nearby who could encourage discussion after the show or answer children's questions during it".&lt;ref name=Whelan&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|title=Saying 'No' is a Child's First Defence|author=Whelan, Judith|date=21 November 1988|page=6|url=https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&amp;NS=16&amp;AID=9UNI002400&amp;an=smhh000020011117dkbl0214s&amp;cat=a&amp;ep=ASI|accessdate=24 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''Kids Can Say No!'' resurfaced in 2014, Peter Walker wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the film "illustrates with grim eloquence, in retrospect, the prosecution notion that [Harris] was a man of two distinct sides: the avuncular and trustworthy public figure, and lurking behind, the groper and abuser".&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; Walker notes that the scene in which a man assaults his child's friend mirrors what Harris did to his daughter's best friend, and that the closing sequence has "an accidental resonance that would only emerge more than 25 years later" because of the two police officers behind Harris.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

According to Richard Guilliatt and [[Jacquelin Magnay]] in an article in ''[[The Australian]]'', Harris' campaign against paedophilia in ''Kids Can Say No!'' can "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; NSPCC chief executive officer [[Peter Wanless]] appeared on ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' saying that Harris' appearance in the film was hypocritical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Rolf Harris Guilty: Abuse Victim Wrote to the Queen to Warn Her as the Presenter Painted Monarch's Portrait|first=Jenn|last=Selby|date=1 July 2014|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/rolf-harris-guilty-victim-wrote-to-the-queen-to-warn-her-as-the-presenter-painted-her-portrait-9575140.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''[[Irish Daily Mail]]'' article, Paul Bracchi writes that Harris' work on ''Kids Can Say No!'' at the same time that he was abusing girls was "one of the most sickening examples [of] hiding in plain sight".&lt;ref name=Bracchi/&gt; In 2014, theme composer Peter Alsop said that Harris may have used the film to [[Child grooming|groom children]] because it encouraged trust by parents.&lt;ref name=Beal/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="94241">The United States government established planning organizations to provide for the coordination of land use, transportation and infrastructure. These Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) may exist as a separate, independent organization or they may be administered by a city, county, [[regional planning organization]], highway commission or other government organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Councils, COGs &amp; MPOs|url=http://narc.org/about-narc/cogs-mpos/|website=National Association of Regional Councils|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each MPO has its own structure and governance. The following is a list of the current federally designated MPOs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10127">[[File:East Africa, c.1500.jpg|thumb|The coast of eastern Africa, c.1500 (George McCall Theal, 1902)]]'''[[Maritime archaeology]] in East Africa''' spans the range from the horn of [[Somalia]] south to [[Mozambique]], and includes the various islands and island chains dotting the map off the coast of Somalia, Mozambique, [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]]. Primary areas along this coast include the [[Zanzibar]] (including the [[Mafia Island|Mafia islands]]), [[Lamu Archipelago|Lamu]], and [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] Archipelagos. Although East African societies developed nautical capabilities for themselves, most of the maritime artifacts point to external merchants from Mediterranean cultures like [[Egypt]] and [[Greece]], and [[China|Chinese]] from East Asia in the early stages, to the great European powers during the Ages of Colonization and Imperialism.

== Sea movement ==
While the use of ocean marine resources dates back to as early as 60 kya in South African sites such as [[Blombos Cave]], and later along the east coast, the record for the use of nautical technologies is less known. Based on dating of [[Later Stone Age|LSA]] sites in Zanzibar Cave on the island of Zanzibar, the use of nautical technology would date at least to the 7th or 8th century AD for the Tanzanian coastal cultures that moved from the mainland to inhabit the island. That date can be pushed back even further by sites discovered in the Mafia Archipelago, sites which suggest colonization during the [[Early Iron Age]], which has been dated to between the 1st and 6th century AD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The exact time of settlement is up for debate though, as studies performed in Kuumbi Cave show. Kuumbi Cave is located near the southeast coast of Zanzibar, based on artifacts dated from the site there is an argument presented that the residents of Zanzibar crossed over a land bridge that existed in the late Pliocene, before the sea level rose around 8000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shipton|first=Ceri|last2=Crowther|first2=Alison|last3=Kourampas|first3=Nikos|last4=Prendergast|first4=Mary E.|last5=Horton|first5=Mark|last6=Douka|first6=Katerina|last7=Schwenninger|first7=Jean-Luc|last8=Faulkner|first8=Patrick|last9=Morales|first9=Eréndira M.

This trade started long before the implementation of boats, but was made easier after the fact.[[File:Fishing Dhow (7969886158).jpg|thumb|Fishing dhow]]

=== African vessels ===
[[File:Sur-Dhow (2).JPG|thumb|Trade or transport dhow]]
When outside cultures like [[Culture of ancient Rome|Rome]] and China encountered the East African coast, they did not come to people foreign to the concept of boat usage, though the scale was much different. While both came in large trading vessels the local Africans relied more on vessels that kept close to the coast which were used more for local trading and fishing than long expeditions. East Africans to this day use a ship style called a [[dhow]] which was introduced by the Arabic merchants who came into the region. The dhow is not one particular ship design, but more of a class of ships, with sizes and schematics ranging from the smaller fishing dhow to the much larger shows used for transporting goods and passengers.

== Outside contact ==
East Africa has had a long history of connections to the global marketplace, having been a direct part of the [[Silk Road]] as early as the 1st century AD. It has become home to people of many ethnicities, including Arabic merchants and settlers, Chinese sailors, European merchants and remnants of the European colonial families, and the culture groups that are descended from those who were there to begin with.

=== Contact with Rome ===
Roman trade vessels would make the 3,000 nautical mile journey south from the important trade ports of [[Myos Hormos]] and [[Berenice Troglodytica|Berenice]] in Egypt to the African trade port of Zanzibar.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=284208|title=Rome's Trade with the East: The Sea Voyage to Africa and India on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists to this day, what has been classified as a sea journal of a Roman pilot or merchant from the 1st century AD, this journal is called the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea|Periplus Maris Erythraei]],'' and it records the voyage of a Roman trade ship that sailed from the Red Sea south along the African coast.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Contact with China and East Asia ===
In the 1400s AD the East African coast encountered the trading fleets of China, led by [[Zheng He]], the Chinese trader and servant of the Emperor. From geophysical surveying of the coast around [[Lamu]] Kenya, archaeologists have discovered what appear to be Chinese porcelain artifacts dating to the 14th century AD, local legend and heritage has it that one or more Chinese vessels were lost in the area.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Contact with Arabia ===
Today, the East African coast has become almost synonymous with the term "[[Swahili coast]]", the Swahili coast being denoted by peoples of the [[Swahili culture]] which is a combination of Arabic language and culture and the language and culture of the native peoples of Africa. Much of the land range is the same, but the Swahili culture extends into the northern coast of Madagascar and into northern Somalia, Djibouti and Eritrea.

=== Contact with Europe ===
While European powers were familiar with the goods of Africa's east coast, it was not until their ships were able to get around the southern cape of Africa that their connections to the coast became direct. With the rush for land, resources and power beginning in the late 15th century AD by Europe, encountering the rich coast of East Africa was a goldmine, both figuratively and literally as cities like Mogadishu in Somalia and Sofala in Mozambique being hubs for gold obtained from the interior of the continent.

In Ngomeni Kenya, archaeologists discovered  16th century AD shipwreck which, along with certain artifacts found with the ship suggest European origins and Portuguese ownership. The artifacts in question are copper ingots marked with a seal of ownership, the seal being of a trident.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Underwater sites ==
While some underwater sites have been identified and are under analysis, little is known about the overall quantity and diversity of the wrecks to be found along the coast. In some cities along the coast, like [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] in Tanzania, and [[Lamu]] in Kenya, archaeologists have found images of Arabic ships carved into the walls of mosques, which are interpreted as being requests of protection for the ships carved.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pollard|first=Edward|last2=Bates|first2=Richard|last3=B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22123">[[Music]] has been used in [[psychological operations]]. The term '''music torture''' is sometimes used by critics of the practice of playing [[loud music]] incessantly to prisoners or people besieged.

The [[United Nations]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] have banned the use of loud music in [[interrogation]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The term [[torture]] is sometimes used to describe the practice. While it is acknowledged by US interrogation experts that it causes discomfort, it has also been characterized by them as causing no "long-term effects".&lt;ref name=BbcMusicTorture20030523&gt;

Music and sound have been usually used as part of a combination of interrogation methods, today recognized by international bodies as amounting to torture.&lt;ref&gt;UN Committee Against Torture 1997 "Concluding observations: Israel. 09/05/1997."  {{cite web |url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/1B3ED23212DCBE3B05256547005C47FA |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728224401/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/1B3ED23212DCBE3B05256547005C47FA |archivedate=2014-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacking all senses without leaving any visible traces, they have formed the basis of the widely discussed torture in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo]] and [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]]. They were, however, devised much earlier in the 1950s and early 1960s, as a way to counter so-called Soviet "brainwashing".&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Alfred W (2006). ''A Question of Torture.

"Detainees have reported being routinely subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment during arrest and detention. Many have told Amnesty International that they were tortured and ill-treated by US and UK troops during interrogation. Methods often reported include prolonged sleep deprivation; beatings; prolonged restraint in painful positions, sometimes combined with exposure to loud music; prolonged hooding; and exposure to bright lights. Virtually none of the allegations of torture or ill-treatment has been adequately investigated by the authorities."

According to recent research, the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|Greek military Junta]] (1967–1974) used the above-mentioned combination of interrogation techniques, including music. This took place in the headquarters of the Special Interrogation Unit of Greek Military Police (EAT/ESA), Athens. New interviews with survivors, held there in 1973, talk about the use of songs, popular hits of the time: these were played loudly and repeatedly from loudspeakers as the detainee had to stand without rest, food, drink or sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Papaeti Anna (2013). “Music, Torture, Testimony: Reopening the Case of the Greek Military Junta (1967–74).” the world of music (special issue): Music and Torture | Music and Punishment 2:1(2013), guest edited by M.

==Popular culture==

In the book ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' by [[Anthony Burgess]] and the subsequent [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film]] based upon it, a rebellious teenager is subjected to brutal experimental brain-washing techniques that cause him to feel physical pain if he has similar violent thoughts to those that sent him to jail in the first place; as an accidental side-effect, he has the same response if he hears [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]].  Later, a man tortures him by locking him in a room where the symphony is played loudly.

In ''[[Back to the Future]]'', Marty used music made by [[Van Halen]] to scare his dad, George McFly, awake, implying that since that kind of music did not exist in that time, it would scare him.

In ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', a helicopter squadron plays classical music, [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]'', over loudspeakers on-board their helicopters while attacking a Viet Cong village, as a form of psychological warfare.

In [[Woody Allen]]'s early film ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'', a prisoner is tortured by being tied up in a room while operetta, featuring an annoying coluratora soprano, is played over and over on a cheap record-player. 

In ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', Mimi played "[[Panama (song)|Panama]]" by Van Halen repeatedly to drive Drew and friends from his house.

In an episode of the U.S. television show ''[[Burn Notice]]'' Sam Axe plays loud music to a prisoner to break his will.

In the film ''[[The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)|The Men Who Stare at Goats]]'', a take-off of the [[Barney &amp; Friends]] ending song "I Love You" is played in the cells of Iraqi detainees as a form of torture.

In the TV series ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'', [[Grindcore]] is used to keep a prisoner awake.

In ''Power Rangers Megaforce'', Emma sings a song to help the rangers defeat Dischord.

In the series 'Lost', [[drum and bass]] music is used to keep an islander's boyfriend awake and indoctrinated and tortured.

In one episode of 'The Flash' Cisco plays 'Never Gonna Give You Up' on repeat to Hartley get him to reveal information they need.

Public awareness of the use of this technique is widespread enough that it can be used in satirical attacks on popular culture:

Zero dB is an initiative against music torture set up by legal charity [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]], which represents over thirty prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. Zero dB aims to stop torture music by encouraging widespread condemnation of the practice and by calling on governments and the UN to uphold and enforce the Convention Against Torture and other relevant treaties. The initiative is backed by the Musicians Union which is calling on British musicians to voice their outrage against the use of music to torture.

Musicians and the wider public are making their own silent protests against music torture which are being shown on Zero dB. A series of silent protests and actions are planned through 2009. Participating musicians will include minutes of silence in their concerts to draw their audience's attention to the USA's use of deafening music against captives.

According to the ''Associated Press'' [[FBI]] agents stationed at Guantanamo Bay reported that the use of deafening music was common.&lt;ref name=AP2008-12-09/&gt;
According to the ''Associated Press''
Guantanamo Bay spokesmen [[Commander]] [[Pauline Storum]]:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20536">'''Novel ecosystems''' are human-built, modified, or engineered [[ecological niche|niches]] of the [[Anthropocene]]. They exist in places that have been altered in structure and function by human agency. Novel ecosystems are part of the [[human ecology|human]] [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[Ecological niche|niche]] (including [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]], and [[rural]]), they lack natural analogs, and they have extended an influence that has converted more than three-quarters of wild Earth. These anthropogenic [[biome]]s include technoecosystems that are fuelled by powerful [[energy sources]] (fossil and nuclear) including ecosystems populated with technodiversity, such as roads and unique combinations of soils called [[technosols]]. [[Vegetation association]]s on old buildings or along field boundary stone walls in old agricultural [[landscape]]s are examples of sites where research into novel [[ecosystem ecology]] is developing.

==Overview==

[[Human society]] has transformed the planet to such an extent that we may have ushered in a new epoch known as the ''[[anthropocene]]''. The ecological niche of the anthropocene contains entirely novel ecosystems that include technosols, technodiversity, [[anthrome]]s, and the [[#Technosphere|technosphere]]. These terms describe the human ecological phenomena marking this unique turn in the evolution of Earth's history.&lt;ref name="Odum05"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Odum | first1=E.

Ellis (2008)&lt;ref name="Ellis08" /&gt; identifies twenty-one different kinds of anthropogenic biomes that sort into the following groups: 1) dense settlements, 2) villages, 3) croplands, 4) rangeland, 5) forested, and 6) wildlands. These anthropogenic biomes (or anthromes for short) create the technosphere that surrounds us and are populated with diverse technologies (or technodiversity for short). Within these anthromes the human species (one species out of billions) appropriates 23.8% of the global net primary production. "This is a remarkable impact on the biosphere caused by just one species."

===Noosphere===
{{Main|Noosphere}}
Noosphere (sometimes '''noösphere''') is the "[[theory of mind|sphere]] of human thought".&lt;ref&gt;Georgy S. Levit: The Biosphere and the Noosphere Theories of V. I. Vernadsky and P. Teilhard de Chardin: A Methodological Essay. International Archives on the History of Science/Archives Internationales D'Histoire des Sciences, 50 (144) - 2000: S. 160-176 {{cite web |url=http://www2.uni-jena.de/biologie/ehh/personal/glevit/Teilhard.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050517081543/http://www2.uni-jena.de/biologie/ehh/personal/glevit/Teilhard.pdf |archivedate=2005-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''νοῦς'' ([[nous]] "[[mind]]") + ''σφαῖρα''  (sphaira "[[sphere]]"), in lexical analogy to "[[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]" and "[[biosphere]]".&lt;ref&gt;"[...]he defined noosphere as the 'thinking envelope of the biosphere' and the 'conscious unity of souls'" David H. Lane, 1996, "The phenomenon of Teilhard: prophet for a new age" p.4 https://books.google.com/books?id=QrwityQkdxkC&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] 1922 &lt;ref&gt;In 1922, Teilhard wrote in an essay with the title 'Hominization': "And this amounts to imagining, in one way or another, above the animal biosphere a  human sphere, a sphere of reflection, of conscious invention, of conscious souls (the noosphere, if you will)" (1966, p. 63) It was a neologism employing the Greek word noos for "mind."  ( Teilhard de Chardin, "Hominization" (1923), "The Vision of the Past" pages 71,230,261 https://books.google.com/books?id=GnwPAQAAIAAJ )&lt;/ref&gt; in his [[Cosmogenesis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Tambov State Technical University: [http://www.tstu.ru/win/kultur/nauka/vernad/uchver.htm Russian Scientist V.I.Vernadsky], in Russian&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is the first use of the term by [[Édouard Le Roy]], who together with [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Chardin]] was listening to lectures of [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] at [[Sorbonne]]. In 1936 [[Vladimir Vernadsky|Vernadsky]] presented on the idea of the Noosphere in a letter to  [[Boris Leonidovich Lichkov]] (though, he states that the concept derives from Le Roy).

===Technosphere===
The technosphere is the part of the environment on Earth where technodiversity extends its influence into the biosphere.&lt;ref name="Barett00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Naveh82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Palm96"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Palm | first1=V. | last2=Östlund | first2=C. | title=Lead and zinc flows from technosphere to biosphere in a city region | journal=Science of the Total Environment | volume=192 | issue=1 | pages=95–109 | year=1996 | doi=10.1016/0048-9697(96)05301-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "For the development of suitable [[restoration (ecology)|restoration]] strategies, a clear distinction has to be made between different functional classes of natural and cultural solar-powered biosphere and fossil-powered technosphere landscapes, according to their inputs and throughputs of energy and materials, their organisms, their control by natural or human information, their internal [[self-organization]] and their regenerative capacities."&lt;ref name="Naveh98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Naveh | first1=Z. | title=Ecological and cultural landscape restoration and the cultural evolution towards a post-industrial symbiosis between human society and nature | journal=Restoration Ecology | year=2004 | volume=6 | issue=2 | pages=135–143 | doi=10.1111/j.1526-100X.1998.00624.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of Earth's technosphere has been calculated as 30 trillion tons, a mass greater than 50 kilos for every square metre of the planet's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161130085021.htm |title=Earth's 'technosphere' now weighs 30 trillion tons |publisher=Science Daily |date=30 November 2016|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technoecosystems===
The concept of technoecosystems has been pioneered by ecologists [[Howard T. Odum]] and Zev Naveh. Technoecosystems interface with and are competitive toward natural systems. They have advanced technology (or technodiversity) money-based [[market economies]] and have a large [[ecological footprint]]s.  Technoecosystems have far greater [[energy use|energy requirements]] than natural ecosystems, excessive [[water consumption]], and release [[toxic]] and [[eutrophication|eutrophicating]] chemicals.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naveh82" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Odum01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naveh98" /&gt; Other ecologists have defined the extensive [[street network|global network of road system]]s as a type of technoecosystem.&lt;ref name="Lugoa00" /&gt;

===Technoecotypes===
"Bio-agro- and techno-ecotopes are spatially integrated in larger, regional landscape units, but they are not structurally and functionally integrated in the ecosphere. Because of the adverse impacts of the latter and the great human pressures on bio-ecotopes, they are even antagonistically related and therefore cannot function together as a coherent, sustainable ecological system."&lt;ref name="Naveh98" /&gt;{{rp|136}}

The '''Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/871/contents/made The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 (as originally made).]&lt;/ref&gt; which originally came into effect at the end of August 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/648/contents/made The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Great Britain]] and in 1999 in [[Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/1999/115/contents/made The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first ''producer responsibility'' legislation in the UK.

The [[Packaging Waste]] Regulations work on the principle of ''Collective Producer Responsibility'' - enforcing producers of packaging to take responsibility for their environmental impact. The Regulations require obligated producers to pay a proportion of the cost of the recovery and recycling of their packaging.

==Proportions==

Companies must show that they have paid for their obligation for recovery and recycling of the packaging. This is achieved through the [[Packaging Recovery Note]] (PRN) System.

Under the Packaging Waste Regulations the so-called 'packaging chain' is divided into four activities, each with a different percentage responsibility:
* '''raw material manufacturer: 6%'''  Manufacturing of packaging raw material, e.g. manufacturer of steel for baked beans cans.
* '''converter: 9%'''  Manufacturing of a recognised packaging item, e.g. manufacturer of the steel can for the baked beans.
* '''packer/filler: 37%'''  Putting a product into packaging or applying packaging to a product, e.g. the company which fills the can with baked beans.
* '''seller: 48%'''  Supplying the packaging to the end user of that packaging, e.g. the supermarket which sells the baked bean can to the consumer. '''OR''' The wholesaler who sells boxed cans of beans would have the selling obligation on the boxes removed by the supermarket.

Companies who directly import packaging, packaged goods or packaging materials are also obligated. The level of their obligation depends on the stage of the chain at which the packaging is brought into the UK but, in every case, they pick up the rolled-up obligations for all stages carried out before the packaging or packaging materials reach the UK.

==The PRN System==

The legislation stipulates that companies who are obligated under the Regulations must prove they have paid for the requisite amount of tonnes to be recovered each year. Reprocessors are licensed to issue a [[Packaging Recovery Note]] (PRN), or PERNs for exported packaging, for each tonne of specific material they have recovered. Regulated companies must buy the appropriate quantity of PRNs for the appropriate materials as proof they have fulfilled their obligations.  For a percentage of each tonne of packaging waste generated, a PRN is required as proof that a tonne of that material ([[wood]], [[paper]], [[glass]], [[plastic]], [[aluminium]] or [[steel]]) has been recycled. The price of PRNs is set by the reprocessors according to the availability of material being recycled. Thus PRNs have joined the [[commodities]] marketplace.

A company falls under the legislation if they: have a turnover of more than £2 million ''and'' handled more than 50 tonnes of packaging in the previous calendar year.

PRNs are certificates issued by accredited reprocessors when packaging waste is recycled or recovered. These PRNs are put onto the open market to be purchased by obligated companies as evidence that they have met their calculated obligation. This can be done directly or through a compliance scheme, of which there are several.

'''Promise of Paradise: Early Chinese Buddhist Sculpture''' is a rotating exhibition at the [[Freer Gallery of Art]], the Smithsonian's museum of Asian art. The exhibition opened in December 2012, showcasing Chinese Buddhist Art influenced by [[Buddhism]].

Buddhism is founded on the religious principles and practices expounded by Siddhartha Gautama (circa 563–483 BCE), a spiritual teacher from the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/current/promise-of-paradise.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Through a long period of meditation he cultivated a mind free of ignorance, greed, and hatred. Thus enlightened and freed from the cycle of rebirth, he became known as the Buddha, the "awakened one" in Sanskrit, and Shakyamuni, literally Sage of the Shakyas, after his clan group. Missionaries conveyed his teachings from India across Central Asia to northwest China by 100 CE, where the faith ultimately prospered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/current/promise-of-paradise.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

As Buddhism developed, paths to spiritual understanding multiplied; additional deities and disciplines were identified to offer different kinds of guidance to enlightenment. Representations of four different Buddhas—Shakyamuni (the Historical Buddha), Prabutaratna (Buddha of the Remote Past), Amitabha (Buddha of the Western Paradise), and Vairochana (the Cosmic Buddha)—along with divinities such as Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, and Maitreya, the Buddha of the Future are featured. In keeping with their Indian origins, they are frequently referred to by their Sanskrit names and the names they were given in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/current/promise-of-paradise.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these images were created from the sixth to the eighth century, when Buddhism was widely followed in China and styles of religious sculptures rapidly evolved. During this period, gilt bronze images were made for domestic altars while more monumental stone figures were created for large freestanding temple buildings and man-made cave chapels. Although they are now removed from their original context, these icons still represent specific Buddhist teachings. Commissioned by emperors and commoners, they all convey the enduring appeal of the promise of paradise.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/current/promise-of-paradise.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10385">The word '''psychosophy''' has etymological roots in the Greek words ψυχή (''psychē'') and σοφίᾱ (''sophiā''), which are often interpreted as "soul" and "wisdom", respectively. It was used in a wide variety of contexts from 1743 to the 1920s but fell out of use in the 20th century.

There are several distinct contexts in which the word has been employed, including:
# Early historical uses
# [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|Theosophical]] and [[neo-theosophical]] and [[Anthroposophical]]
# The contemporary school of psychology founded by the American teacher, Scott Hamilton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychosophy.com See Psychosophy.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early historical usages and references==
* [[Antonio Genovesi]] (1713–1769) was an Italian writer on [[philosophy]] and political economy. His first works were ''Elementa Melaphysicae'' (1743) and ''Lógica'' (1745). The former is divided into four parts: Ontosophy, Cosmosophy, Theosophy, and Psychosophy, and is supplemented by a treatise on ethics and a dissertation on first causes.
* In 1913, the term was employed by the American philosopher and developmental psychologist [[James Mark Baldwin]] in his book ''History of Psychology: A Sketch and Interpretation'' (Volume I, Chapter II). Baldwin referenced the use of the word psychosophy in the 17th to 18th century as a "catch-all" term for early pre-scientific approaches to exploring the psyche (i.e., magic and mythic approaches preceding the rise of Western [[psychology]] as a formal scientific discipline). The term was similarly referenced in multiple subsequent psychological texts (e.g., Jared Sparks Moore's "Foundations of Psychology") in the '10s and early '20s, presumably employing the word in a manner similar to that of Baldwin.
* ''A History of Psychology'', by Otto Klemm, Emil Carl Wilm, Rudolf Pintner, translated by Emil Carl Wilm, Rudolf Pintner, published by C. Scribner's Sons, 1914, original from the University of Michigan, digitized Oct 3, 2006, 380 pages, Psychosophy reference on p.&amp;nbsp;147:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The word psychology does not occur previous to the sixteenth century. Melanchthon employed the term as a title of academic lectures. R. Gockel used it in 1590 as a collective title for the works of various authors. The term became generally known through [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679–1754), who did so much for the establishment of philosophical terminology. Up to Wolff's time the term "psychosophy", apparently introduced by J. J. Becker, seems to have been in use. The term pneumatology is also found in the writings of Leibniz.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the philosopher [[:es:Julio Ozan Lavoisier|Julio Ozan Lavoisier]], ''Psychosophy'': "it is a knowledge of the first causes, which aims at the plenitude of human beings and their integration in the World through the unification of the mind".&lt;ref&gt;-''The Return to the Sources, Chapter Philosophy, Religion and Psychosophy''- Ed. Rueda, Madrid España, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  A basic principle of this discipline is that "psychic balance and moral balance are consecutive." Nevertheless, it does not deal with personal or subjective problems, as it may only bloom in mature spirits. Therefore, "psychosophy starts where psychology ends." "Psychosophy starts from an essential perspective (for which the author has developed a theory of perspective within his theory of knowledge), not from what has been revealed but from what is revealing" (Op. Cit.).

Eleven years later, Ozan Lavoisier published ''Psychosophy. Psycho-philosophical research on the nature of human beings'',&lt;ref&gt;Julio Ozan Lavoisier, ''Psychosophy'', Ed. Dunquen, Buenos Aires, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; a thick volume in which he elaborates upon his method of knowledge in detail. He make clear that his discipline is not in search of news, but "perennial truths found in ancient traditions."  It is essentially ''"a philosophy that makes use of transcendental psychology in order to provide grounds for a metaphysics, ethics, esthetics, a theory of knowledge and a philosophy of history, that is to say, a philosophical system."'' This system has been developed in the following treatises:
* ''Return to the Sources'' (Ed. Rueda, Madrid 1993)
* ''Psychosophy. Psycho-philosophical research on Human nature'' (Dunken, Bs.As. 2004)
* ''Origin and Destiny of Man'' (Dunken, Bs. As. 2008)
* ''The Evolution of Spirit'' (Dunken, Bs. As. 2009)
* ''The Evolution of the Spirit. From Greece to  the West, from India to the East.'' (Har-Anand Publishers, Delhi, 2017)
* ''The Spirit in History'' (Dunken, Bs. As.)
* ''The Spirit in the Moral''. The author's next book.
* ''The Spirit in the Arts.'' The author's next book.
Therefore, the concept of Psychosophy, according to Ozán Lavoisier, should be interpreted in the context of this system, independently of other views or schools that have adopted this concept.

==Theosophical and neo-theosophical==
The word psychosophy was utilized in several articles published in the Theosophical journal ''The Theosophist'':
* The Philosophy of Spirit – Hierosophy, Theosophy &amp; Psychosophy (1), William Oxley, an index to ''The Theosophist'', September, 1882, v3, p298
* The Philosophy of Spirit – Hierosophy, Theosophy &amp; Psychosophy (2), [[Tallapragada Subba Row|T Subba Row]], an index to ''The Theosophist'', October, 1882 v4, p18

The term was also used by William Wilberforce Juvenal Colville in an obscure 1914 publication entitled "The New Psychosophy." The following year, in 1915, [[Cora L. V. Scott|Cora L.V. (Scott) Richmond]] employed the word as the title of her 436-page book exploring various metaphysical subjects. These two writings are examples of the approach that could broadly be considered neo-theosophical.

The term was used by the Austrian philosopher and scholar Rudolf Steiner in a three part series of twelve lectures given in Berlin in 1910, two years before he left the Theosophical Society, but was not apparently used again in Steiner's extensive published works. The lectures lay almost dormant for nearly 90 years until their publication. The four lectures on psychosophy discuss Steiner's perspective on the primary aspects of the human soul, the activities and interactions of various soul forces, the dynamics of love and hate, and the process of judging. Steiner distinguished psychosophy from [[anthroposophy]] (wisdom of the human being) and [[pneumatosophy]] (wisdom of the spirit).&lt;ref&gt;R. Steiner, ''A Psychology of Body, Soul, &amp; Spirit: Anthroposophy, Psychosophy &amp; Pneumatosophy'', Steiner Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner states; "''Psychosophy'' is to be a deliberation on the human soul, beginning with the soul's experiences here in the physical world. It then rises to higher realms to demonstrate that whatever we encounter in the physical as the manifest soul-life leads to the perspective where the light of Theosophy comes to meet us."&lt;ref&gt;R. Steiner, ''A Psychology of Body, Soul, &amp; Spirit: Anthroposophy, Psychosophy &amp; Pneumatosophy'', Steiner Books, 1999, p77&lt;/ref&gt; He continues; "every aspect of the soul is either a making of judgments or a life in love or hate. Basically, these are the only concepts that pertain to the soul; all others refer to a vehicle for something coming into the soul, either from without through the body, or (due to causes we will learn later) from the spirit within. Thus, on the one hand, we have judgment, and, on the other, love and hate ... My characterization is not about logic, but about the psychosophic nature &amp;ndash; strictly from the perspective of inner activity, or soul processes &amp;ndash; of judging. Everything you can learn about judgment through logic is ruled out. I am not speaking of 'judgment' but of ''judging'', the ''activity'' of judging, using the word as a verb."&lt;ref&gt;R. Steiner, ''A Psychology of Body, Soul, &amp; Spirit: Anthroposophy, Psychosophy &amp; Pneumatosophy'', Steiner Books, 1999 pp 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scott Hamilton==
The American teacher Scott Hamilton has trademarked the United States for his contemporary school of psychology offering coaching, consulting and education and synthesizes psychology, philosophy, spirituality, growth technology, and creative actualization. The synthesis unites common elements of past schools of psychology with new research methodology and models of human nature, development, relationships, creativity, coaching, consulting and education. Placing these in causal sequence, psychosophy can be viewed as:

# A new interior research method generating
# An experimentally verified model of inner human nature, which leads to
# A new understanding of human development,
# A new understanding of human relationships, and
# A new understanding of human creativity, all of which are integrated into
# New coaching, consulting and educational systems

Hamilton began developing and sharing the central principles and techniques underlying psychosophy in 1987, following a vision experience of the project. In 1994 he combined the first part of psychology with the second part of philosophy to create the term psychosophy. It was only years later that he discovered that the term had been used in a variety of other contexts in the early 20th and prior centuries. In 1999 Hamilton began formally offering Psychosophy Coaching and Consulting Services. He trained the first group of Psychosophy coaches and consultants from 2005–10, all of whom have launched private practices. In 2008 peer-reviewed research into one of psychosophy's foundational practices—Holding Loving Space—was conducted by Nicholas Hedlund and published in [[Ken Wilber]]'s and [[Sean Esbjörn-Hargens]]' ''Journal of Integral Theory and Practice''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.integralresearchcenter.org/source under Vol. 3 No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 psychosophy's model of human consciousness, the Consciousness Coordinate System, was presented at the Integral Theory Conference at [[John F. Kennedy University]] in Northern California.

'''Rebellion''', '''uprising''', or '''insurrection''' is a refusal of obedience or order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cyclopædia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political ... |last=Lalor |first=John Joseph |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1884 |publisher=Rand, McNally |location= |isbn= |pages=632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the open resistance against the orders of an established [[authority]]. The term comes from the Latin verb ''rebellō,'' "I renew war" (from ''re-'' ("again") + ''bellō'' ("I wage war/I revolt").  The rebel is the individual that partakes in rebellion or rebellious activities, particularly when armed. Thus, the term ''rebellion'' also refers to the ensemble of rebels in a state of revolt.

A rebellion originates from a sentiment of indignation and disapproval of a situation and then manifests itself by the refusal to submit or to obey the authority responsible for this situation. Rebellion can be individual or collective, [[peace]]ful ([[civil disobedience]], [[civil resistance]], and [[nonviolent resistance]]) or [[violent]] ([[terrorism]], [[sabotage]] and [[guerrilla warfare]].) {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In political terms, rebellion and revolt are often distinguished by their different aims. If rebellion generally seeks to evade and/or gain concessions from an oppressive power, a revolt seeks to overthrow and destroy that power, as well as its accompanying laws. The goal of rebellion is resistance while a '''revolt''' seeks a revolution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  As power shifts relative to the external adversary, or power shifts within a mixed [[coalition]], or positions harden or soften on either side, an insurrection may seesaw between the two forms.

== Causes ==

=== Macro approach ===
The following theories broadly build on the Marxist interpretation of rebellion. They explore the causes of rebellion from a wide lens perspective.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} Rebellion is studied, in Theda Skocpol's words, by analyzing "objective relationships and conflicts among variously situated groups and nations, rather than the interests, outlooks, or ideologies of particular actors in revolutions".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=291}}

==== Marxist insight ====
[[Karl Marx]]'s analysis of revolutions sees such expression of [[political violence]] not as anomic, episodic outbursts of discontents but rather the symptomatic expression of a particular set of objective but fundamentally contradicting class-based relations of power. Indeed, the central tenet of Marxist philosophy, as expressed in [[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]], is the analysis of society's mode of production (technology and labor) concomitant with the ownership of productive institutions and the division of profit. Marx writes about "the hidden structure of society" that must be elucidated through an examination of "the direct relationship of the owners of the conditions of production to the direct producers". The mismatch, between one mode of production, between the social forces and the social ownership of the production, is at the origin of the revolution.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=7}} The inner imbalance within these modes of production is derived from the conflicting modes of organization, such as capitalism within feudalism, or more appropriately socialism within capitalism. The dynamics engineered by these class frictions help class consciousness root itself in the collective imaginary. For example, the development of the bourgeoisie class went from oppressed merchant class to urban independence, eventually gaining enough power to represent the state as a whole. Social movements, thus, are determined by an exogenous set of circumstances. The proletariat must also, according to Marx, go through the same process of self-determination which can only be achieved by friction against the bourgeoisie. In Marx's theory revolutions are the "locomotives of history", it is because rebellion has for ultimate goal to overthrow the ruling class and its antiquated mode of production. Later, rebellion attempts to replace it with a new system of political economy, one that is better suited to the new ruling class, thus enabling societal progress. The cycle of rebellion, thus, replaces one mode of production by another through the constant class friction.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=8}}

==== Ted Gurr: Roots of political violence ====
In his book ''Why Men Rebel'', [[Ted Robert Gurr|Ted Gurr]] looks at the roots of political violence itself applied to a rebellion framework. He defines political violence as: "all collective attacks within a political community against the political [[Political regime|regime]], its actors [...] or its policies. The concept represents a set of events, a common property of which is the actual or threatened use of violence".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=3}} Gurr sees in violence a voice of anger that manifests itself against the established order. More precisely, individuals become angry when they feel what Gurr labels as [[Relative deprivation thesis|relative deprivation]], meaning the feeling of getting less than one is entitled to. He labels it formally as the "perceived discrepancy between value expectations and value capabilities".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=37}} Gurr differentiates between three types of relative deprivation:
# ''Decremental deprivation'': one's capacities' decrease when expectations remain high. One example of this is the proliferation and thus depreciation of  the value of higher education.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=47}}
# ''Aspirational Deprivation'': one's capacities stay the same when expectations rise. An example would be a first generation college student lacking the contacts and network to obtain a higher paying job while watching her better-prepared colleagues bypass her.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=52}}
# ''Progressive deprivation'': expectation and capabilities increase but the former cannot keep up. A good example would be an automotive worker being increasingly marginalized by the automatisation of the assembly line.{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=53}}
Anger is thus comparative. One of his key insight is that "The potential for collective violence varies strongly with the intensity and scope of relative deprivation among members of a collectivity".{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=24}} This means that different individuals within society will have different propensities to rebel based on their particular internalization of their situation. As such, Gurr differentiates between three types of political violence:{{sfn|Gurr|1970|p=11}}
# ''Turmoil'' when only the mass population encounters relative deprivation;
# ''Conspiracy'' when the population but especially the elite encounters relative deprivation;
# ''Internal War'', which includes revolution. In this case, the degree of organization is much higher than turmoil, and the revolution is intrinsically spread to all sections of society, unlike the conspiracy.

==== Charles Tilly: Centrality of collective action ====
In ''From Mobilization to Revolution'', [[Charles Tilly]] argues that political violence is a normal and endogenous reaction to competition for power between different groups within society. "Collective violence", Tilly writes, "is the product of just normal processes of competition among groups in order to obtain the power and implicitly to fulfill their desires”.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=54}} He proposes two models to analyze political violence:
# The ''polity'' model takes into account government and groups jockeying for control over power. Thus, both the organizations holding power and the ones challenging them are included.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=ch3}} Tilly labels those two groups "members" and "challengers". 
# The ''mobilization'' model aims to describe the behavior of one single party to the political struggle for power. Tilly further divides the model in two sub-categories, one that deals with the internal dynamics of the group, and the other that is concerned with the "external relations" of the entity with other organizations and/or the government. According to Tilly, the cohesiveness of a group mainly relies on the strength of common interests and the degree of organization. Thus, to answer Gurr, anger alone does not automatically create political violence. Political action is contingent on the capacity to organize and unite. It is far from irrational and spontaneous.
Revolutions are included in this theory, although they remain for Tilly particularly extreme since the challenger(s) aim for nothing less than full control over power.{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=ch7}} The "revolutionary moment occurs when the population needs to choose to obey either the government or an alternative body who is engaged with the government in a zero sum game. This is what Tilly calls "multiple sovereignty".{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=213}} The success of a revolutionary movement hinges on "the formation of coalitions between members of the polity and the contenders advancing exclusive alternative claims to control over Government.".{{sfn|Tilly|1978|p=213}}

==== Chalmers Johnson and societal values ====
For Chalmers Johnson, rebellions are not so much the product of political violence or collective action but in "the analysis of viable, functioning societies".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=3}} In a quasi-biological manner, Johnson sees revolutions as symptoms of pathologies within the societal fabric. A healthy society, meaning a "value-coordinated social system"{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=36}} does not experience political violence. Johnson's equilibrium is at the intersection between the need for society adapt to changes but at the same time firmly grounded in selective fundamental values. The legitimacy of a political order, he posits, relies exclusively on its compliance with these societal values and in its capacity to integrate and adapt to any change. Rigidity is, in other words, inadmissible. Johnson writes "to make a revolution is to accept violence for the purpose of causing the system to change; more exactly, it is the purposive implementation of a strategy of violence in order to effect a change in social structure".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=57}} The aim of a revolution is to re-align a political order on new societal values introduced by an externality that the system itself has not been able to process. Rebellions automatically must face a certain amount of coercion because by becoming "de-synchronized", the now illegitimate political order will have to use coercion to maintain its position. A simplified example would be the French Revolution when the Parisian Bourgeoisie did not recognize the core values and outlook of the King as synchronized with its own orientations. More than the King itself, what really sparked the violence was the uncompromising intransigence of the ruling class. Johnson emphasizes "the necessity of investigating a system's value structure and its problems in order to conceptualize the revolutionary situation in any meaningful way".{{sfn|Johnson|1966|p=32}}

==== Theda Skocpol and the Autonomy of the State ====
Skocpol introduces the concept of the social revolution, to be contrasted with a political revolution. While the later aims to change the polity, the former is "rapid, basic transformations of a society's state and class structures; and they are accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=4}} Social revolutions are grassroots movement by nature because they do more than change the modalities of power, they aim to transform the fundamental social structure of society. As a corollary, this means that some "revolutions" may cosmetically change the organization of the monopoly over power without engineering any true change in the social fabric of society. Her analysis is limited to studying the French, Russian, and Chinese revolutions. Skocpol identifies three stages of the revolution in these cases (which she believes can be extrapolated and generalized), each accordingly accompanied by specific structural factors which in turn influence the social results of the political action. 
# ''The Collapse of the Old-Regime State'': this is an automatic consequence of certain structural conditions. She highlights the importance of international military and economic competition as well as the pressure of the misfunctioning of domestic affairs. More precisely, she sees the breakdown of the governing structures of society influenced by two theoretical actors, the "landed upper class" and the "imperial state".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=49}} Both could be considered as "partners in exploitation" but in reality competed for resources: the state (monarchs) seek to build up military and economic power to ascertain their geopolitical influence. The upper class works in a logic of [[profit maximization]], meaning preventing as much as possible the state to extract resources. All three revolutions occurred, Skocpol argues, because states failed to be able to "mobilize extraordinary resources from the society and implement in the process reforms requiring structural transformations".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=50}} The apparently contradicting policies were mandated by a unique set of geopolitical competition and modernization. "Revolutionary political crises occurred because of the unsuccessful attempts of the Bourbon, Romanov, and Manchu regimes to cope with foreign pressures."{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=50}} Skocpol further concludes "the upshot was the disintegration of centralized administrative and military machineries that had theretofore provided the sole unified bulwark of social and political order".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=51}}
# ''Peasant Uprisings'': more than simply a challenge by the landed upper class in a difficult context, the state needs to be challenged by mass peasant uprisings in order to fall. These uprisings must be aimed not at the political structures ''per se'' but at the upper class itself, so that the political revolution becomes a social one as well. Skocpol quotes Barrington Moore who famously wrote: "peasants [...] provided the dynamite to bring down the old building".{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=112}} Peasant uprisings are more effective depending on two given structural socioeconomic conditions: the level of autonomy (from both an economic and political point of view) peasant communities enjoy, and the degree of direct control the upper class on local politics. In other words, peasants must be able to have some degree of agency in order to be able to rebel. If the coercive structures of the state and/or the landowners keep a very close check on peasant activity, then there is no space to forment dissent. 
# ''Societal Transformation'': this is the third and decisive step after the state organization has been seriously weakened and peasant revolts become widespread against landlords. The paradox of the three revolutions Skocpol studies is that stronger centralized and bureaucratic states emerge after the revolts.{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=162}} The exact parameters depend, again, on structural factors as opposed to voluntarist factors: in Russia, the new state found most support in the industrial base, rooting itself in cities. In China, most of the support for the revolt had been in the countryside, thus the new polity was grounded in rural areas. In France, the peasantry was not organized enough, and the urban centers not potent enough so that the new state was not firmly grounded in anything, partially explaining its artificiality. 
Here is a summary of the causes and consequences of social revolutions in these three countries, according to Skocpol:{{sfn|Skocpol|1979|p=155}}

=== Microfoundational evidence on causes ===
The following theories are all based on [[Mancur Olson]]'s work in ''[[The Logic of Collective Action]]'',a 1965 book that conceptualizes the inherent [[Tragedy of the commons|problem]] with an activity that has concentrated costs and diffuse benefits. In this case, the benefits of rebellion are seen as a [[public good]], meaning one that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous.{{sfn|Olson|1965|p=9}}  Indeed, the political benefits are generally shared by all in society if a rebellion is successful, not just the individuals that have partaken in the rebellion itself. Olson thus challenges the assumption that simple interests in common are all that is necessary for [[Collective action theory|collective action]]. In fact, he argues the "[[Free rider problem|free rider]]" possibility, a term that means to reap the benefits without paying the price, will deter rational individuals from collective action. That is, unless there is a clear benefit, a rebellion will not happen en masse. Thus, Olson shows that "selective incentives", only made accessible to individuals participating in the collective effort, can solve the free rider problem.{{sfn|Olson|1965|p=76}}

==== ''The Rational Peasant'' ====
{{Main article|The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam}}

Samuel L. Popkin builds on Olson's argument in ''The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam.'' His theory is based on the figure of a hyper rational peasant that bases his decision to join (or not) a rebellion uniquely on a cost-benefit analysis. This formalist view of the collective action problem stresses the importance of individual economic rationality and self-interest: a peasant, according to Popkin, will disregard the ideological dimension of a social movement and focus instead on whether or not it will bring any practical benefit to him. According to Popkin, peasant society is based on a precarious structure of economic instability. Social norms, he writes, are "malleable, renegotiated, and shifting in accord with considerations of power and strategic interaction among individuals"{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=22}} Indeed, the constant insecurity and inherent risk to the peasant condition, due to the peculiar nature of the patron-client relationship that binds the peasant to his landowner, forces the peasant to look inwards when he has a choice to make. Popkin argues that peasants rely on their "private, family investment for their long run security and that they will be interested in short term gain vis-à-vis the village. They will attempt to improve their long-run security by moving to a position with higher income and less variance".{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=23}} Popkin stresses this "investor logic" that one may not expect in agrarian societies, usually seen as pre-capitalist communities where traditional social and power structures prevent the accumulation of capital. Yet, the selfish determinants of collective action are, according to Popkin, a direct product of the inherent instability of peasant life. The goal of a laborer, for example, will be to move to a tenant position, then smallholder, then landlord; where there is less variance and more income. Voluntarism is thus non-existent in such communities.

Popkin singles out four variables that impact individual participation:
# Contribution to the expenditure of resources: collective action has a cost in terms of contribution, and especially if it fails (an important consideration with regards to rebellion) 
# Rewards : the direct (more income) and indirect (less oppressive central state) rewards for collective action 
# Marginal impact of the peasant's contribution to the success of collective action
# Leadership "viability and trust" : to what extent the resources pooled will be effectively used.
Without any moral commitment to the community, this situation will engineer free riders. Popkin argues that selective incentives are necessary to overcome this problem.{{sfn|Popkin|1979|p=34}}

===== Opportunity cost of rebellion =====
Political Scientist Christopher Blattman and World Bank economist Laura Alston identify rebellious activity as an "occupational choice".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=22}} They draw a parallel between criminal activity and rebellion, arguing that the risks and potential payoffs an individual must calculate when making the decision to join such a movement remains similar between the two activities. In both cases, only a selected few reap important benefits, while most of the members of the group do not receive similar payoffs.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}} The choice to rebel is inherently linked with its opportunity cost, namely what an individual is ready to give up in order to rebel. Thus, the available options beside rebellious or criminal activity matter just as much as the rebellion itself when the individual makes the decision. Blattman and Alston, however, recognize that "a poor person's best strategy" might be both rebellion illicit and legitimate activities at the same time.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}} Individuals, they argue, can often have a varied "portofolio" of activities, suggesting that they all operate on a rational, profit maximizing logic. The authors conclude that the best way to fight rebellion is to increase its opportunity cost, both by more enforcement but also by minimizing the potential material gains of a rebellion.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=23}}

===== Selective incentives based on group membership =====
The decision to join a rebellion can be based on the prestige and social status associated with membership in the rebellious group. More than material incentives for the individual, rebellions offer their members [[club good]]s, [[public good]]s that are reserved only for the members inside that group. Economist [[Eli Berman]] and Political Scientist David D. Laitin's study of radical religious groups show that the appeal of club goods can help explain individual membership. Berman and Laitin discuss [[Suicide attack|suicide]] operations, meaning acts that have the highest cost for an individual. They find that in such a framework, the real danger to an organization is not volunteering but preventing defection. Furthermore, the decision to enroll in such high stakes organization can be rationalized.{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1965}} Berman and Laitin show that religious organizations supplant the state when it fails to provide an acceptable quality of public goods such a public safety, basic infrastructure, access to utilities, or schooling.{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1944}} Suicide operations "can be explained as a costly signal of “commitment” to the community".{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1943}} They further note "Groups less adept at extracting signals of commitment (sacrifices) may not be able to consistently enforce incentive compatibility."{{sfn|Berman and Laitin|2008|p=1954}} Thus, rebellious groups can organize themselves to ''ask'' of members proof of commitment to the cause. Club goods serve not so much to coax individuals into joining but to prevent defection.

===== Greed vs grievance model =====
{{Main article|Greed versus grievance}}
World Bank economists [[Paul Collier]] and Anke Hoeffler compare two dimensions of incentives:
# [[Greed]] rebellion: "motivated by predation of the rents from primary commodity exports, subject to an economic calculus of costs and a military survival constraint".{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}}
# [[Grievance]] rebellion: "motivated by hatreds which might be intrinsic to ethnic and religious differences, or reflected objective resentments such as domination by an [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] majority, political repression, or [[economic inequality]]".{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}} The two main sources of grievance are political exclusion and inequality.
Vollier and Hoeffler find that the model based on grievance variables systematically fails to predict past conflicts, while the model based on greed performs well. The authors posit that the high cost of risk to society is not taken into account seriously by the grievance model: individuals are fundamentally risk-adverse. However, they allow that conflicts create grievances, which in turn can become risk factors. Contrary to established beliefs, they also find that a multiplicity of ethnic communities make society safer, since individuals will be automatically more cautious, at the opposite of the grievance model predictions.{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=26}} Finally, the authors also note that the grievances expressed by members of the [[diaspora]] of a community in turmoil has an important on the continuation of violence.{{sfn|Collier and Hoeffler|2002|p=27}} Both greed and grievance thus need to be included in the reflection.

==== ''The Moral Economy of the Peasant'' ====
{{Main article|The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia}}

Spearheaded by political scientist and anthropologist [[James C. Scott]] in his  book ''[[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of the Peasant]]'', the [[moral economy]] school considers moral variables such as social norms, moral values, interpretation of justice, and conception of duty to the community as the prime influencers of the decision to rebel. This perspective still adheres to Olson's framework, but it considers different variables to enter the cost/benefit analysis: the individual is still believed to be rational, albeit not on material but moral grounds.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=6}}

===== Early conceptualization: E. P. Thompson and bread riots in England =====
Before being fully conceptualized by Scott, British historian [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson]] was the first to use the term "moral economy" in ''Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=E. P.|date=1971-01-01|title=The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century|jstor=650244|journal=Past &amp; Present|issue=50|pages=76–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, he discussed English bread riots, regular, localized form of rebellion by English peasants all through the 18th century. Such events, Thompson argues, have been routinely dismissed as "riotous", with the connotation of being disorganized, spontaneous, undirected, and undisciplined. In other words, anecdotal. The reality, he suggests, was otherwise: such riots involved a coordinated peasant action, from the pillaging of food convoys to the seizure of grain shops. Here, while a scholar such as Popkin would have argued that the peasants were trying to gain material benefits (crudely: more food), Thompson sees a legitimization factor, meaning "a belief that [the peasants] were defending traditional rights and customs".  Thompson goes on to write: "[the riots were] legitimized by the assumptions of an older moral economy, which taught the immorality of any unfair method of forcing up the price of provisions by profiteering upon the necessities of the people". Later, reflecting on this work, Thompson would also write: "My object of analysis was the ''mentalité'', or, as I would prefer, the political culture, the expectations, traditions, and indeed, superstitions of the working population most frequently involved in actions in the market".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Customs-Common-Studies-Traditional-Popular/dp/1565840747|title=Customs in Common: Studies in Traditional Popular Culture|last=Thompson|first=E. P.|date=1993-08-01|publisher=The New Press|isbn=9781565840744|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition between a traditional, paternalist, and the communitarian set of values clashing with the inverse liberal, capitalist, and market-derived ethics is central to explain rebellion.

===== James C. Scott and the formalization of the moral economy argument=====
In [[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia]], James C. Scott looks at the impact of exogenous economic and political shocks on peasant communities in Southeast Asia. Scott finds that peasants are mostly in the business of surviving and producing enough to subsist.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=15}} Therefore, any extractive regime needs to respect this careful equilibrium. He labels this phenomenon the "subsistence ethic".{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=13}} A landowner operating in such communities is seen to have the moral duty to prioritize the peasant's subsistence over his constant benefit. According to Scott, the powerful colonial state accompanied by market capitalism did not respect this fundamental hidden law in peasant societies. Rebellious movements occurred as the reaction to an emotional grief, a moral outrage.{{sfn|Scott|1976|p=193}}

===== Other non-material incentives=====
[[Chris Blattman|Blattman]] and Ralston recognize the importance of immaterial selective incentives, such as anger, outrage, and injustice ("grievance") in the roots of rebellions. These variable,s they argue, are far from being irrational, as they are sometimes presented. They identify three main types of grievance arguments:
# ''Intrinsic [[incentive]]s'' holds that "[[injustice]] or perceived transgression generates an intrinsic willingness to punish or seek retribution".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=24}} More than material rewards, individuals are naturally and automatically prompted to fight for justice if they feel they have been wronged. The [[ultimatum game]] is an excellent illustration: player one receives $10 and must split it with another player who doesn't get the chance to determine how much he receives, but only if the deal is made or not (if he refuses, everyone loses their money). Rationally, player 2 should take whatever the deal is because it is better in absolute term ($1 more remains $1 more). However, player 2 is most likely unwilling to accept less than 2 or 2 dollars, meaning that they are willing to pay a-$2 for justice to be respected. This game, according to Blattman and Ralston, represents "the expressive pleasure people gain from punishing an injustice".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=24}}
# ''[[Loss aversion]]'' holds that "people tend to evaluate their satisfaction relative to a reference point, and that they are 'loss adverse".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}} Individuals prefer not losing over the risky strategy of making gains. There is a substantial [[Subjectivity|subjective]] part to this, however, as some may realize alone and decide that they are comparatively less well off than a neighbor, for example. To "fix" this gap, individuals will in turn be ready to take great risks so as to not enshrine a loss.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}}
# ''Frustration-aggression'': this model holds that the immediate emotional reactions to highly stressful environments do not obey to any "direct utility benefit but rather a more impulsive and emotional response to a threat".{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=25}} There are limits to this theory: violent action is to a large extent a product of goals by an individual which are in turn determined by a set of [[preference]]s.{{sfn|Blattman and Rason|2015|p=26}} Yet, this approach shows that contextual elements like economic precarity have a non-negligible impact on the conditions of the decisions to rebel at minimum.

== Recruitment ==
Stathis N. Kalyvas, a political science professor at Yale University, argues that political violence is heavily influenced by hyperlocal socio-economic factors, from the mundane traditional family rivalries to repressed grudges.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}} Rebellion, or any sort of political violence, are not binary conflicts but must be understood as interactions between public and private identities and actions. The "convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives" make studying and theorizing rebellion a very complex affair, at the intersection between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=475}}
Kalyvas argues that we often try to group political conflicts according to two structural paradigms:
# The idea that political violence, and more specifically rebellion, is characterized by a complete breakdown of authority and an anarchic state. This is inspired by Thomas Hobbes' views. The approach sees rebellion as being motivated by greed and loot, using violence to break down the power structures of society.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}}
# The idea that all political violence is inherently motivated by an abstract group of loyalties and beliefs, "whereby the political enemy becomes a private adversary only by virtue of prior collective and impersonal enmity".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}} Violence is thus not a "man to man" affair as much as a :state to state" struggle, if not an "idea vs idea" conflict.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=476}}
Kalyvas' key insight is that the central vs periphery dynamic is fundamental in political conflicts. Any individual actor, Kalyvas posits, enters into a calculated ''alliance'' with the collective.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Rebellions thus cannot be analyzed in molar categories, nor should we assume that individuals are automatically in line with the rest of the actors simply by virtue of ideological, religious, ethnic, or class cleavage. The agency is located both within the collective and in the individual, in the universal and the local.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Kalyvas writes: "Alliance entails a ''transaction'' between supralocal and local actors, whereby the former supply the later with external muscle, thus allowing them to win decisive local advantage, in exchange the former rely on local conflicts to recruit and motivate supporters and obtain local control, resources, and information- even when their ideological agenda is opposed to localism".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Individuals will thus aim to use the rebellion in order to gain some sort of local advantage, while the collective actors will aim to gain power. Violence is a mean as opposed to a goal, according to Kalyvas.

The greater takeaway from this central/local analytical lens is that violence is not an anarchic tactic or a manipulation by an ideology, but a conversation between the two. Rebellions are "concatenations of multiple and often disparate local cleavages, more or less loosely arranged around the master cleavage".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=486}} Any pre-conceived explanation or theory of a conflict must not be placated on a situation, lest one will construct a reality that adapts itself to his pre-conceived idea. Kalyvas thus argues that political conflict is not always political in the sense that they cannot be reduced to a certain discourse, decisions, or ideologies from the "center" of collective action. Instead, the focus must be on "local cleavages and intracommunity dynamics".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=487}} Furthermore, rebellion is not "a mere mechanism that opens up the floodgates to random and anarchical private violence".{{sfn|Kalyvas|2003|p=487}} Rather, it is the result of a careful and precarious alliance between local motivations and collective vectors to help the individual cause.

{{expand section| Correcting the abstractions and anecdotes, and write a comprehensive overview of the classification of rebellion. |date=May 2016}}

An armed but limited rebellion is an insurrection,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1989. Insurrection: "The action of rising in arms or open resistance against established authority or governmental restraint; with pl., an instance of this, an armed rising, a revolt; an incipient or limited rebellion."&lt;/ref&gt; and if the established government does not recognize the rebels as [[belligerent]]s then they are insurgents and the revolt is an [[insurgency]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1989. Insurgent "One who rises in revolt against constituted authority; a rebel who is not recognized as a belligerent."&lt;/ref&gt; In a larger conflict the rebels may be recognized as [[belligerent]]s without their government being recognized by the established government, in which case the conflict becomes a [[civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Kermit L.''The Oxford Guide to United States Supreme Court Decisions'', Oxford University Press US, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-513924-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-513924-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=nO093wNz1PoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA246&amp;dq=insurrection+civil+war&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 pp. 246,247] "In supporting Lincoln on this issue, the Supreme Court upheld his theory of the Civil War as an insurrection against the United States government that could be suppressed according to the rules of war. In this way the United States was able to fight the war as if it were an international war, without actually having to recognize the ''de jure'' existence of the Confederate government."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Civil resistance]] movements have often aimed at, and brought about, the fall of a government or head of state, and in these cases could be considered a form of rebellion. In many of these cases the opposition movement saw itself not only as nonviolent, but also as upholding their country's constitutional system against a government that was unlawful, for example if it had refused to acknowledge its defeat in an election. Thus the term "rebel" does not always capture the element in some of these movements of acting as a defender of legality and constitutionalism.&lt;ref&gt;See the chapters by specialists on the various above-cited cases of civil resistance in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of terms that are associated with ''rebel'' and ''rebellion''. They range from those with positive connotations to those with pejorative connotations. Examples include:
* [[Civil resistance]], [[civil disobedience]], and [[nonviolent resistance]] which do not include violence or paramilitary force .{{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* [[Mutiny]], which is carried out by military or security forces against their commanders {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* Armed [[resistance movement]], which is carried out by [[Resistance movement#Freedom fighter|freedom fighters]], often against an occupying foreign power {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* Revolt, a term that is sometimes used for a more localized rebellions rather than a general uprising {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* [[Revolution]], which is carried out by radicals, usually meant to overthrow the current [[government]] {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* [[Riot]], a form of civil disorder involving violent public disturbance
* [[Subversion]], which are non-overt attempts at sabotaging a government, carried out by spies or other subversives {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}
* [[Terrorism]], which is carried out by different kinds of political, economic or religious [[Militant (word)|militant]] individuals or groups {{Citation needed|reason=Who defined this term in this way=April 2016|date=April 2016}}

In [[biophysics]] and related fields, '''reduced dimension forms (RDFs)''' are unique on-off mechanisms for [[random walk]]s that generate [[Two-state trajectory|two-state trajectories]] (see Fig. 1 for an example of a RDF and Fig. 2 for an example of a two-state trajectory). It has been shown that RDFs solve two-state trajectories, since only one RDF can be constructed from the data,&lt;ref name=first&gt;O. Flomenbom, and R. J. Silbey, Utilizing the information content in two-state trajectories, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103, 10907-10910 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; where this property does not hold for on-off kinetic schemes, where many kinetic schemes can be constructed from a particular two-state trajectory (even from an ideal on-off trajectory).

==Description of RDF==

A RDF is a lattice of substates, each substate represents either the on state or the off state, and has a particular number (see Figure 1). The connections are only among substates of different states.
A simulation of an on-off trajectory from a RDF is made with a generalized [[Gillespie algorithm]], where here a random jumping time is first taken from density functions that are (usually) not exponential using [[Rejection sampling|the rejection method]], and then the specific next substate is chosen according to the jumping probabilities that are determined from the jumping time probability density functions.  
A RDF can have irreversible connections, yet, it generates an on-off trajectory that has the property of [[microscopic reversibility]], meaning that the physical system fluctuates around equilibrium.

==Two-state trajectories==
A two-state trajectory is a fluctuating signal made of on periods and off periods; an on period, and then an off period, and so on (see, Fig. 2). In most cases where this signal appears in applications in science, the trajectory is random; that is, the length of the on and off periods changes, and is a random quantity. There may be correlations in the trajectory; e.g., when we see a short off period and the next on period is relatively long (that is, long with a large probability), we say that there are off-on correlations. In principle, there are 4 independent types of correlations in two-state trajectories: on-on, on-off, off-on, and off-off. Two-state trajectories can be obtained from on-off [[kinetic scheme]]s, RDFs, or any other stochastic equation of motion (with a clear on-off definition). In experiments from [[Single-molecule experiment|individual molecules]], two-state trajectories are common, where from the trajectory we aim at finding the right model of the process.&lt;ref name=[26]&gt;Flomenbom, O., Klafter, J. &amp; Szabo, A. (2005) Biophys. J. 88, 3780–3783.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using RDFs in solving two-state trajectories==
===Properties of RDFs in solving two-state trajectories===
[[File:UTST.jpg|thumb|left| '''Figure3''' A two-state trajectory, RDFs and kinetic schemes, and the relations among these.]]

It was shown in Ref. 1&lt;ref name=first/&gt; that RDFs are unique is the sense that a particular RDF generates a particular time trajectory (in a statistical sense), and a time trajectory is associated with only one RDF. This property does not hold for on-off kinetic schemes, where from a trajectory several kinetic schemes can be constructed ; see for example,.&lt;ref name=first /&gt; RDFs are also constructed more reliably from the data than kinetic schemes.&lt;ref name= [29c]/&gt; Figure 3 illustrates RDFs, kinetic schemes and two-state trajectories, and the relations among these. Given a two-state trajectory (generated from any mechanism), it is safer to go from the data and construct a RDF, rather than trying to construct the kinetic scheme from the data directly. With the constructed RDF, one can find several possible kinetic schemes very accurately (usually, one eventually tries constructing a kinetic scheme from the data), where these kinetic schemes are all equivalent (with regard to the data).

=== The software RDF===
* Based on RDFs, software for deducing the correct mechanisms from real data (e.g. two-state trajectories) is designed.&lt;ref&gt;Please see, http://www.flomenbom.net/codes.html&lt;/ref&gt; See Figure 4 for an illustration of the aims of the software. The software is named '''RDF'''.

[[File:WHAT RDF DOES.jpg|thumb|right|'''Figure 4''' Here, shown are the stages of the software: first, take a noisy trajectory and clean it; then, find the RDF from the cleaned data. Finally, suggest a set of kinetic schemes that may be related with the found RDF. The software should also present the possibility of numerical simulations of noisy time trajectories.]]

{{For|the rapid transit train model in Toronto|S-series (Toronto rapid transit)}}
The '''S-Series of ILS specifications''' is a common denominator for a set of specifications associated to different [[integrated logistics support]] aspects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asd-ssg.org/asd-ils-suite-of-specifications ASD suite of ILS specifications]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally developed by AECMA (French acronym for the Association Européenne des Constructeurs de Matériel Aeronautique, later ASD), the S-Series suite of ILS specifications is managed currently jointly by multinational teams from the [[Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe]] (ASD) and [[Aerospace Industries Association]] (AIA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia-aerospace.org/national_aerospace_standards/s-series_ils_specifications/ AIA involvement in S-Series ILS specifications]&lt;/ref&gt; reporting to the AIA/ASD ILS Council. The ILS Council established the term '''S-Series (of) ILS specifications''' as the common denominator for all its specifications, and this term was consolidated with the publication of [[SX000i]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sx000i.org Official SX000i project home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specification number encoding ==
The encoding of the specifications is inspired by the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC) of human knowledge. Transversal specifications are encoded with an "X" instead of a number, so as to represent the "10" used in [[Roman numerals]]. The initial "S" stands for specification, and the last letter indicates a keyword within the title, as highlighted in the list above. Exceptions to this rule are S1000D (where the "D" stands for [[documentation]]) and the specifications ending in "X", which represents "E'''x'''change". Though all letters are upper case, [[SX000i]] has a lower case ending letter for improved readability and to prevent confusion with an "l" in certain fonts.

== Other associated specifications ==
Though strictly speaking it is not one of the S-Series specifications, [[ASD-STE100]] is often associated to them because of its common origin with the S-Series of ILS specifications.

== Integration of the specification and with other domains ==
The S-Series of ILS specifications have in the past years made a significant effort to be interoperable, as this was not always necessarily true in the past. In that context, SX000i defines the common ILS process to which all the specifications will adhere, and SX002D defines a common data model that binds the data models of the different specifications together. This integration has ensured that the specifications have been included in the ASD Strategic Standardization Group (SSG) Radar Chart&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asd-ssg.org/radar-chart ASD Strategic Standardization Group (SSG) Radar Chart]&lt;/ref&gt; as adopted.

In order to maintain the future interoperability of the specifications, [[SX000i]] establishes in its chapter 4 the governance of the S-Series ILS specifications and a common change process. A common unified S-Series ILS Specifications commenting tool was also established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sx00i.org/CPF Unified S-Series ILS Specifications Commenting Tool]&lt;/ref&gt;

The S-Series of ILS specifications are also involved in the development of the new ISO 10303-239 (AP239) PLCS Edition 3 project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ap239.org/ ISO 10303-239 “Product Life Cycle Support” Edition 3 project]&lt;/ref&gt; so as to integrate with the [[ISO 10303]] STEP architecture and non-support domains such as Engineering or Manufacturing. The representatives of the S-Series in the AP239 Edition 3 project are members of the Data Modeling and Exchange Working Group (DMEWG), which is responsible for the development of SX001G, SX002D, SX003X, SX004G and SX005G.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sx000i.org/DMEWG.html DMEWG home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as being sector-specific, the programs are designed based on different job functions: administration and control, corporate finance, marketing, sales, communication and distribution, organization, human resources, risk management, information systems, strategy and entrepreneurship, technology and operations. There are also more generic programs covering areas such as general management, project management, quantitative methods and leadership.
Class-based lessons are combined with individual assessments, study tours, distance learning, role playing, experiential learning, web-based simulations, field visits, company visits, tutoring and coaching.

In addition to the 200 Executive Open Programs aimed at Italian professionals, the school has designed a number of International Executive Open Programs on subjects such as finance, retail management, marketing and communication. Some of these have been developed in collaboration with institutions, sponsors and international trade associations.

To address the specific needs of companies and organizations, the school has developed what they call the Modello di Corporate Empowerment (i.e. Corporate Empowerment Model), designed especially to create custom programs that are able to strengthen and value organizations. These programs are run by three divisions, each dedicated to one of the School’s main target sectors. The divisions are: DIM ({{lang|it|Divisione Imprese}}), for businesses, DIBA (Divisione Banche, Assicurazioni e Intermediari Finanziari), for banks, insurance companies and financial intermediaries, and DAP (Divisione Amministrazioni Pubbliche, Sanità e non profit), for public administration, healthcare and non-profit organizations.

== Research ==

The Research Division, founded 22 years ago by Prof. Claudio Demattè, uses the outcomes of the latest studies to address the needs  of managers working in companies and in financial and public institutions.   Research projects can take one of the following shapes:
* Custom research projects
* Academic research projects
* Labs

== Alumni Association ==

Alumni from SDA Bocconi and the other Bocconi schools are all members of the Bocconi Alumni Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alumnibocconi.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2015, the Alumni Association is composed of over 95,000 active alumni, 12,000 of which are from SDA Bocconi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdabocconi.it/it/alumni|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004064719/http://www.sdabocconi.it/it/alumni|archivedate=4 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bocconi alumni network is active in over 110 countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdabocconi.it/it/alumni|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004064719/http://www.sdabocconi.it/it/alumni|archivedate=4 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computational electromagnetics]], the '''scattering-matrix method''' ('''SMM''') is a [[numerical method]] used to solve [[Maxwell's equations]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Reciprocity, spatial mapping and time reversal in electromagnetics

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

SMM can, for example, use cylinders to model [[dielectric]]/[[metal]] objects in the domain.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Electromagnetic theory and applications for photonic crystals
 | author = Kiyotoshi Yasumoto
 | publisher = CRC Press
 | year = 2006
 | isbn = 978-0-8493-3677-5
 | page = 3
 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fF6Gd5Wkb78C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=scattering-matrix-method&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=scattering-matrix-method&amp;f=false
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The total-field/scattered-field (TF/SF) formalism where the total field is written as sum of incident and scattered at each point in the domain:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{tot} = E_{inc} + E_{scatt} \ &lt;/math&gt;

By assuming series solutions for the total field, the SMM method transforms the domain into a cylindrical problem. In this domain total field is written in terms of [[Bessel function|Bessel]] and [[Hankel function]] solutions to the cylindrical [[Helmholtz equation]]. SMM method formulation, finally helps compute these coefficients of the cylindrical harmonic functions within the cylinder and outside it, at the same time satisfying EM boundary conditions.

Finally, SMM accuracy can be increased by adding (removing) cylindrical harmonic terms used to model the scattered fields.

SMM, eventually leads to a matrix formalism, and the coefficients are calculated through matrix inversion. For N-cylinders, each scattered field modeled using 2M+1 harmonic terms, SMM requires to solve a N(2M + 1) system of equations. 

==Advantages==

SMM, is a rigorous and accurate method deriving from first principles. Hence, it is guaranteed to be accurate within limits of model, and not show suprious effects of numerical dispersion arising in other techniques like [[Finite-difference time-domain method|FDTD]].

==History==
Over the years, Science Week Ireland has grown from a small pilot initiative to a large promotional and event engine to its current identity as a recognised vehicle for regional activity supported by a national promotional campaign.&lt;ref name="oak1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahlstrom|first1=Dick|title=Science Week: From small acorn to giant oak tree . . .|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sponsored/science-week-from-small-acorn-to-giant-oak-tree-1.2403471|website=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The first Science Week in Ireland was held in 1996.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; It was organised by Forfás on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation under the name 'Information Technology and Science Week'. The week aimed to raise general awareness of the benefits of science and information technology to people, young and old throughout society. In 1997 it was renamed as Science Week. Professional bodies, voluntary groups, colleges, businesses and the public sector combined to organise 50 events countrywide.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; Events included conferences, lectures, interactive exhibitions, debates, and competitions for primary school students. 

SFI took over Science Week from the Forfás Discover Science and Engineering programme in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New legislation to focus scientific research on turning good ideas into good jobs|url=https://www.irishbuildingmagazine.ie/2012/12/12/new-legislation-to-focus-scientific-research-on-turning-good-ideas-into-good-jobs|publisher=Irish Building Magazine|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Week continued to grow and develop over the following years into what it represents today, a week-long&lt;ref name="sfi ie1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Week|url=http://www.sfi.ie/engagement/science-week/|website=sfi.ie|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebration of STEM public engagement, enhancing the public’s interest in STEM and enabling them to see the relevance of STEM to their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Foundation Ireland Discover Programme Call 2017|url=http://www.sfi.ie/funding/funding-calls/sfi-discover-programme/1.-SFI-Discover-Programme-Call-2017-FINAL.pdf|website=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''self-fulfilling prophecy''' is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true, by the very terms of the prophecy itself, due to [[positive feedback]] between belief and behavior. Although examples of such [[prophecy|prophecies]] can be found in literature as far back as [[ancient Greece]] and [[History of India|ancient India]], it is 20th-century [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]] who is credited with coining the expression "self-fulfilling prophecy" and formalizing its structure and consequences. In his 1948 article ''Self-Fulfilling Prophecy'', Merton defines it in the following terms: 
{{quote|The self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the beginning, a ''false'' definition of the situation evoking a new behavior which makes the original false conception come ''true''. This specious validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning.&lt;ref name=SFP-48&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In other words, a positive or negative prophecy, strongly held belief, or [[delusion]]—declared as truth when it is actually false—may sufficiently influence people so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-false prophecy.

Self-fulfilling prophecy are effects in ''[[behavioral confirmation]] effect'', in which behavior, influenced by expectations, causes those expectations to come true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Darley |first=John M. |first2=Paget H. |last2=Gross |title=Stereotypes and prejudice: essential readings |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Stangor |year=2000 |publisher= Psychology Press |page=212 |chapter=A Hypothesis-Confirming Bias in Labelling Effects |isbn=978-0-86377-589-5 |oclc=42823720}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is complementary to the [[self-defeating prophecy]].

==History of the concept==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
Merton's concept of the ''self-fulfilling prophecy'' stems from the [[Thomas theorem]], which states that "If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences".&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Child in America: Behavior Problems and Programs |last=Thomas |first=W. I. |authorlink=W. I. Thomas |year=1928 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |isbn= |pages=572 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas, people react not only to the situations they are in, but also, and often primarily, to the way they perceive the situations and to the meaning they assign to their perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/nominal-interest-rates-and-money-supply-and-demand-1147766|title=How Money Supply and Demand Determine Nominal Interest Rates|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Therefore, their behaviour is determined in part by their perception and the meaning they ascribe to the situations they are in, rather than by the situations themselves. Once people convince themselves that a situation really has a certain meaning, regardless of whether it actually does, they will take very real actions in consequence.

Merton took the concept a step further and applied it to recent social phenomena. In his book ''Social Theory and Social Structure'', he conceives of a [[bank run]] at the fictional Last National Bank, over which Cartwright Millingville presides. It is a typical bank, and Millingville has run it honestly and quite properly. As a result, like all banks, it has some [[Asset|liquid assets]] (cash), but most of its assets are invested in various ventures. Then one day, a large number of customers come to the bank at once—the exact reason is never made clear. Customers, seeing so many others at the bank, begin to worry. False rumours spread that something is wrong with the bank, and more customers rush to the bank to try to get some of their money out while they still can. The number of customers at the bank increases, as does their annoyance and excitement, which in turn fuels the false rumours of the bank's [[insolvency]] and upcoming [[bankruptcy]], causing more customers to come and try to withdraw their money. At the beginning of the day—the last one for Millingville's bank—the bank was not insolvent. But the rumour of insolvency caused a sudden demand of withdrawal of too many customers, which could not be answered, causing the bank to become insolvent and declare bankruptcy. Merton concludes this example with the following analysis:

{{quote|The parable tells us that public definitions of a situation (prophecies or predictions) become an integral part of the situation and thus affect subsequent developments. This is peculiar to human affairs. It is not found in the world of nature, untouched by human hands. Predictions of the return of [[Comet Halley|Halley's comet]] do not influence its orbit. But the rumoured insolvency of Millingville's bank did affect the actual outcome. The prophecy of collapse led to its own fulfilment.&lt;ref name="merton"&gt;{{cite book |title= Social Theory and Social Structure|last= Merton|first= Robert K|authorlink= Robert K.

Merton concluded that the only way to break the cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy is by redefining the propositions on which its false assumptions are originally based.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In economic "expectations models" of inflation, peoples' expectations of future inflation lead them to spend more today and demand higher nominal interest rates for any savings, since they expect that prices will be rising. This demand for higher nominal interest rates and increased spending in the present, in turn, create inflationary pressure and can cause inflation even if the expectations of future inflation are unfounded.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The expectations theory of inflation played a large role in [[Paul Volcker]]'s actions during his tenure as the Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]] in combating the "[[stagflation]]" of the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] called the self-fulfilling prophecy the ''Oedipus effect'':

{{quote|One of the ideas I had discussed in ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' was the influence of a prediction upon the event predicted. I had called this the "Oedipus effect", because the oracle played a most important role in the sequence of events which led to the fulfilment of its prophecy. … For a time I thought that the existence of the Oedipus effect distinguished the social from the natural sciences. But in biology, too—even in molecular biology—expectations often play a role in bringing about what has been expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Unended Quest: An Intellectual Autobiography |last=Popper |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Popper |year=1976 |publisher=Open Court |location=LaSalle, Illinois |isbn=978-0-87548-343-6 |oclc=2927208 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An early precursor of the concept appears in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'': "During many ages, the prediction, as it is usual, contributed to its own accomplishment" (chapter I, part II).

===Applications===
Examples abound{{examples|date=May 2014}} in studies of [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]] and the related [[self-perception theory]]; people will often change their [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] to come into line with what they profess publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Carrasco-Villanueva, M. A., [http://revistasinvestigacion.unmsm.edu.pe/index.php/econo/article/view/14336 El Efecto “Pricebo”: Cómo los precios pueden influenciar la percepción sobre la calidad del cannabis y sus implicaciones en las políticas de precios"], ''Pensamiento Crítico,'' vol. 22, n. 2, pp 175-210&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In the United States, the concept was broadly and consistently applied in the field of public education reform, following the "[[War on Poverty]]". Theodore Brameld noted: "In simplest terms, education already projects and thereby reinforces whatever habits of personal and cultural life are considered to be acceptable and dominant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brameld |first=T. |authorlink= |year=1972 |title=Education as self-fulfilling prophecy |journal=Phi Beta Kappa |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=8–11, 58–61 [p. 9]|url= |quote= }} Quoted by Wilkins (1976), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of teacher attitudes, beliefs and values, affecting their expectations have been tested repeatedly.&lt;ref name="Wilkins1976"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilkins |first=William E. |authorlink= |year=1976 |title=The Concept of a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy |journal=Sociology of Education |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=175–183 |issn=0038-0407|quote= |doi=10.2307/2112523 |jstor= 2112523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of the "inevitability of war" is a self-fulfilling prophecy that has received considerable study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The role of expectancy |title=The Tensions That Cause Wars |last=Allport |first=G. |authorlink= |editor=Cantrill, H. |year=1950 |publisher=University of Illinois |location=Urbana |isbn= |pages=43–78 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is similar to that discussed by the philosopher [[William James]] as "[[The Will to Believe]]." But James viewed it positively, as the self-validation of a belief.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Just as, in Merton's example, the belief that a bank is insolvent may help create the fact, so too, on the positive side, confidence in the bank's prospects may help brighten them.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Similarly, Stock-exchange panic episodes, and speculative bubble episodes, can be triggered with the belief that the stock will go down (or up), thus starting the selling/buying mass move, etc.

A more Jamesian example: a swain, convinced that the fair maiden ''must'' love him, may prove more effective in his wooing than he would had his initial prophecy been defeatist.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

There is extensive evidence{{where|date=May 2014}} of "Interpersonal Expectation Effects", where the seemingly private expectations of individuals can predict the outcome of the world around them. The mechanisms by which this occurs are also reasonably well understood: it is simply that our own expectations change our behaviour in ways we may not notice and correct. In the case of the "Interpersonal Expectation Effects", others pick up on non-verbal behaviour, which affects their attitudes. A famous{{according to whom|date=May 2014}} example includes a study where teachers were told arbitrarily that random students were "going to blossom".{{Failed verification|date=May 2014}}  Oddly, those random students actually ended the year with significantly greater improvements.&lt;ref name=Rosenthal-2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenthal |first=Robert |year=2003 |title=Covert communication in laboratories, classrooms, and the truly real world |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |publisher=Blackwell |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=151–154 |doi= 10.1111/1467-8721.t01-1-01250|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/Rosenthal2003.pdf |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pygmalion in the Classroom|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Robert|last2=Jacobson|first2=Lenore|year=2003|publisher=Crown House|isbn=9781904424062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
In Canadian ice hockey, junior league players are selected based on skill, motor coordination, physical maturity, and other individual merit criteria. However, psychologist Robert Barnsley showed that in any elite group of hockey players, 40% are born between January and March, versus the approximately 25% as would be predicted by statistics. The explanation is that in Canada, the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey is January 1, and the players who are born in the first months of the year are older by 0–11 months, which at the preadolescent age of selection (nine or ten) manifests into an important physical advantage. The selected players are exposed to higher levels of coaching, play more games, and have better teammates. These factors make them actually become the best players, fulfilling the prophecy, while the real selection criterion was age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|title=[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]|year=2008|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|isbn=978-0-316-01792-3|pages=20–25|chapter=1 – The Matthew Effect|laysummary=http://www.rugbyiq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1199:is-it-because-of-talent-that-athletes-succeed&amp;catid=102:mental-toughness&amp;Itemid=458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotype==
{{Main|Stereotype threat}}
This specific form of self-fulfilling prophecy is very common and takes many forms. For example, the expectancy for a political party to act in a certain way—based on [[Internalized racism|race]], religion, gender and much more—can eventually lead the said party to imitate the stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, N. R. (19992000). Personality. Psychology: the science of behaviour (Canandian ed., p. 492). Scarborough, Ont.: Allyn and Bacon Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature, media, and the arts==
In literature, self-fulfilling prophecies are often used as [[plot device]]s. They have been used in stories for millennia, but have gained a lot of popularity recently in the [[science fiction]] genre. They are typically used ironically, with the prophesied events coming to pass due to the actions of one trying to prevent the prophecy (a recent example would be the life of [[Anakin Skywalker]], the fictional Jedi-turned-Sith Lord in [[George Lucas]]' [[Star Wars (franchise)|''Star Wars'' saga]]). They are also sometimes used as comic relief.

===Classical===
Many myths, legends and fairy tales make use of this motif as a central element of narratives that are designed to illustrate [[Destiny|inexorable fate]], fundamental to the Hellenic world-view.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], [[Moirai]], [[Erinyes]]. "Very often the bases for false definitions and consequent self-fulfilling prophecies are deeply rooted in the individual or group norms and are subsequently difficult to change". (Wilkins 1976:177).&lt;/ref&gt; In a common motif, a child, whether newborn or not yet conceived, is prophesied to cause something that those in power do not want to happen. This may be the death of the powerful person; in more light-hearted versions, it is often the marriage of a poor or lower-class child to his own.&lt;!--own what?--&gt; The events come about, nevertheless, as a result of the actions taken to prevent them: frequently [[Child abandonment#Child abandonment in literature|child abandonment]] sets the chain of events in motion.

====Greek====
[[File:Oedipe enfant.JPG|thumb|[[Oedipus]] in the arms of [[Phorbas]].]]
The best known example from Greek legend is that of [[Oedipus]]. Warned that his child would one day kill him, [[Laius]] abandoned his newborn son Oedipus to die, but Oedipus was found and raised by others, and thus in ignorance of his true origins. When he grew up, Oedipus was warned that he would kill his father and marry his mother. Believing his foster parents were his real parents, he left his home and travelled to Greece, eventually reaching the city where his biological parents lived. There, he got into a fight with a stranger, his real father, killed him and married his widow, Oedipus' real mother.

Although the legend of [[Perseus]] opens with the prophecy that he will kill his grandfather [[Acrisius]], and his abandonment with his mother [[Danaë]], the prophecy is only self-fulfilling in some variants. In some, he accidentally spears his grandfather at a competition—an act that could have happened regardless of [[Acrisius]]' response to the prophecy. In other variants, his presence at the games is explained by his hearing of the prophecy, so that his attempt to evade it does cause the prophecy to be fulfilled. In still others, [[Acrisius]] is one of the wedding guests when [[Polydectes]] tried to force Danaë to marry him, and when [[Perseus]] turns them to stone with the [[Medusa|Gorgon]]'s head; as Polydectes fell in love with Danaë because Acrisius abandoned her at sea, and Perseus killed the Gorgon as a consequence of Polydectes' attempt to get rid of Danaë's son so that he could marry her, the prophecy fulfilled itself in these variants.

Greek historiography provides a famous variant: when the Lydian king [[Croesus]] asked the [[Delphic Oracle]] if he should invade Persia, the response came that if he did, he would destroy a great kingdom. Assuming this meant he would succeed, he attacked—but the kingdom he destroyed was his own.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus ''Histories'' 1.88&lt;/ref&gt; In such an example, the prophecy prompts someone to action because he is led to expect a favorable result; but he achieves another, disastrous result which nonetheless fulfills the prophecy.

People do not necessarily have to unsuccessfully avoid a prophecy in order for the prophecy to be self-fulfilling. For example, when it was predicted that [[Zeus]] would overthrow his father, [[Cronus|Cronos]], and usurp his throne as King of the Gods, he actively waged war against him in a direct attempt to fulfill this prophecy. This makes the prophecy a self-fulfilling one because it was the prophecy itself that gave Zeus the inspiration to do it in the first place.

====Roman====
[[File:Lupa romana.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Romulus and Remus]] feeding from a wolf.]]
The story of [[Romulus and Remus]] is another example. According to legend, a man overthrew his brother, the king. He then ordered that his two nephews, Romulus and Remus, be drowned, fearing that they would someday kill him like he did to his brother. The boys were placed in a basket and thrown in the [[Tiber River]]. A wolf found the babies and she raised them. Later, a shepherd found the twins and named them Romulus and Remus. As teenagers, they found out who they were. They killed their uncle, fulfilling the prophecy.

====Persian====
Another example of a self-fulfilling prophecy is detailed by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in his account of [[Cyrus the Great]]'s life. In this account, Astyages had two prophetic dreams. Both dreams involved something particular (in the first dream, a flood, while in the second dream, a fruit bearing vine) emerging from his daughter Mandane's pelvis and covering the entirety of Asia. After consulting the Magi, he was informed that the dreams
foreshadowed the birth of a child who would eventually rule in his place. Terrified by the prophecies, Astyages summoned [[Harpagus]] and commanded him to kill the child after it's born. Harpagus, however, was reluctant to kill the child and so assigned the task to one of Astyages' cowherds. The cowherd likewise hesitated and so he and his wife devised a plan to expose their own child, that was born dead, to a desolate place in the mountains while raising the other child as their own. The child was afterwards named Cyrus. One day, when Cyrus was 10 years old, an incident with one of the children he was playing with brought him before king Astyages to give account for his actions. While listening to Cyrus' words, Astyages became suspicious that Cyrus could be the child he wanted to kill. After pressuring his cowherd to relay to him everything about the child, the cowherd finally revealed everything about how he happened upon the child and how he decided to raise him as his own. Astyages, angered with Harpagus summoned him as well and Harpagus likewise revealed the truth. In revenge, the king killed Harpagus' son and later made this act known to Harpagus. However, he spared Cyrus' life as the magi, attempting to further clarify the prophecy to him, accidentally misinterpreted it and thus saved Cyrus. After some time Harpagus, possibly driven by revenge, took advantage of Cyrus' prosperous growth and Astyages' misdeeds to persuade him to revolt against Astyages. His efforts eventually proved successful as Cyrus became king and Astyages was imprisoned. {{sfn|Herodotus|p=1.107-130}}

====Arabic====
A variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy is the self-fulfilling dream, which dates back to medieval [[Arabic literature]]. Several tales in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', use this device to [[Foreshadowing|foreshadow]] what is going to happen, as a special form of literary [[Flashforward|prolepsis]]. A notable example is "[[The Ruined Man Who Became Rich Again Through a Dream]]", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of [[Baghdad]] and travel to [[Cairo]], where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune after losing belief in the prophecy, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in [[English folklore]] as the "[[Pedlar of Swaffham]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=193–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in "[[The Tale of Attaf]]", where [[Harun al-Rashid]] consults his library (the [[House of Wisdom]]), reads a random book, "falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful ''[[vizier]]''" [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] from sight. Ja'far, "disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in [[Damascus]], involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries." After returning to Baghdad, Ja'far reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of [[Retrocausality|reverse causality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, this tale was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by [[Petrus Alphonsi]] and included in his ''Disciplina Clericalis''. In the 14th century, a version of this tale also appears in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
[[File:Radhakrishna manor.JPG|thumb|right|[[Krishna]] playing his flute with [[Radha]].]]
Self-fulfilling prophecies appear in classical [[Sanskrit literature]]. In the story of [[Krishna]] in the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the ruler of the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] kingdom, [[Kamsa|Kansa]], afraid of a prophecy that predicted his death at the hands of his sister [[Devaki]]'s son, had her cast into prison where he planned to kill all of her children at birth. After killing the first six children, and Devaki's apparent miscarriage of the seventh, Krishna (the eighth son) was born. As his life was in danger he was smuggled out to be raised by his foster parents [[Yashoda]] and [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]] in the village of [[Gokula]]. Years later, Kansa learned about the child's escape and kept sending various demons to put an end to him. The demons were defeated at the hands of Krishna and his brother [[Balarama]]. Krishna, as a young man returned to Mathura to overthrow his uncle, and Kansa was eventually killed by his nephew Krishna. It was due to Kansa's attempts to prevent the prophecy that led to it coming true, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

====Russian====
[[Oleg of Novgorod]] was a [[Varangian]] prince who ruled over the [[Rus (people)|Rus people]] during the early tenth century. As old [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] chronicles say, it was prophesied by the pagan priests that Oleg's stallion would be the source of Oleg's death. To avoid this he sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy. In the [[Primary Chronicle]], Oleg is known as the Prophet, ironically referring to the circumstances of his death. The story was romanticized by [[Alexander Pushkin]] in his celebrated ballad "The Song of the Wise Oleg". In Scandinavian traditions, this legend lived on in the saga of [[Orvar-Odd]].

====European fairy tales====
Many fairy tales, such as ''[[The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs]]'', ''[[The Fish and the Ring]]'', ''[[The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars]]'', or ''[[The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate]]'', revolve about a prophecy that a poor boy will marry a rich girl (or, less frequently, a poor girl a rich boy).&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 139, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This is story type 930 in the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|Aarne–Thompson]] classification scheme. The girl's father's efforts to prevent it are the reason why the boy ends up marrying her.

Another fairy tale occurs with older children. In ''[[The Language of the Birds]]'', a father forces his son to tell him what the birds say: that the father would be the son's servant. In ''[[The Ram (fairy tale)|The Ram]]'', the father forces his daughter to tell him her dream: that her father would hold an ewer for her to wash her hands in. In all such tales, the father takes the child's response as evidence of ill-will and drives the child off; this allows the child to change so that the father will not recognize his own offspring later and so offer to act as the child's servant.

In some variants of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', such as ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'', the sleep is not brought about by a curse, but a prophecy that she will be endangered by flax (or hemp) results in the royal order to remove all the flax or hemp from the castle, resulting in her ignorance of the danger and her curiosity.

====Shakespeare====
[[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' is another classic example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The three witches give Macbeth a prophecy that Macbeth will eventually become king, but afterwards, the offspring of his best friend will rule instead of his own. Macbeth tries to make the first half true while trying to keep his bloodline on the throne instead of his friend's. Spurred by the prophecy, he kills the king and his friend, something he, arguably, never would have done before. In the end, the evil actions he committed to avoid his succession by another's bloodline get him killed in a revolution.

The later prophecy by the first apparition of the witches that Macbeth should "Beware Macduff" is also a self-fulfilling prophecy. If Macbeth had not been told this, then he might not have regarded Macduff as a threat. Therefore, he would not have killed Macduff's family, and Macduff would not have sought revenge and killed Macbeth.

===Modern===
Similar to Oedipus above, a more modern example would be [[Darth Vader]] in the ''Star Wars'' films, or [[Lord Voldemort]] in the [[Harry Potter (franchise)|Harry Potter]] franchise and the Big Three in [[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]] - each attempted to take steps to prevent action against them which had been predicted could cause their downfall, but instead ''created'' the conditions leading to it. Another, less well-known, modern example occurred with the character John Mitchell on [[BBC Three]]'s ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]''. The Disney television series ''[[That's So Raven]]'' stars [[Raven-Symoné]] as the title character with the ability to see into the future with a strange situation. The extreme steps that the character takes to prevent the situation are almost always what lead to it.

====New Thought====
The [[law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]] is a typical example of self-fulfilling prophecy. It is the name given to the belief that "like attracts like" and that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, one can bring about positive or negative results.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;Whittaker, S. [http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 Secret attraction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090328/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''The Montreal Gazette'', May 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redden, Guy, ''Magic Happens: A New Age Metaphysical Mystery Tour'', Journal of Australian Studies: 101&lt;/ref&gt; According to this law, all things are created first by imagination, which leads to thoughts, then to words and actions. The thoughts, words and actions held in mind affect someone's intentions which makes the expected result happen. Although there are some cases where positive or negative attitudes can produce corresponding results (principally the [[placebo]] and [[nocebo]] effects), there is no scientific basis to the law of attraction.&lt;ref name="skepdic"&gt;{{cite web

==Causal loop==
{{see also|Causal loop|Newcomb's paradox}}
A self-fulfilling prophecy may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be ''truly'' known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. [[Predestination]] does not necessarily involve a [[supernatural]] power, and could be the result of other "infallible foreknowledge" mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Craig|first=William Lane|year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in [[Newcomb's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dummett|first=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|isbn13=9780198240112|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pp=356, 370–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which [[Oedipus]] becomes the king of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother.

{{sociology}}

'''Social theories''' are analytical frameworks, or paradigms, that are used to study and interpret social phenomena.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Seidman, S., 2016. Contested knowledge: Social theory today. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; A tool used by [[social scientists]], social theories relate to historical debates over the validity and reliability of different methodologies (e.g. [[positivism]] and [[antipositivism]]), the primacy of either [[structure or agency]], as well as the relationship between contingency and necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp.388-396. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/d2310?journalCode=epda &lt;/ref&gt;  Social theory in an informal nature, or authorship based outside of academic social and political science, may be referred to as "[[social criticism]]" or "[[social commentary]]", or "cultural criticism" and may be associated both with formal [[cultural studies|cultural]] and [[literary criticism|literary]] scholarship, as well as other non-academic or journalistic forms of writing.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Definitions ==

'''Social theory''' by definition is used to make distinctions and generalizations among different types of societies, and to analyze [[modernity]] as it has emerged in the past few centuries.&lt;ref name=Callinicos&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Theory: A Historical Introduction |author=Callinicos, A. |year=1999 |publisher=New York University Press |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} Social theory as it is recognized today emerged in the 20th century as a distinct discipline, and was largely equated with an attitude of critical thinking and the desire for knowledge through ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' methods of discovery, rather than ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' methods of tradition.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  

'''Social thought''' provides general theories to explain actions and behavior of society as a whole, encompassing [[sociology|sociological]], [[political science|political]], and [[philosophy|philosophical]] ideas. Classical social theory has generally been presented from a perspective of [[Western philosophy]], and often regarded as [[Eurocentric]].{{by whom?|date=July 2018}}

==History==

===Ancient===
[[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE) envisaged a just society that went beyond his contemporary society of the [[Warring States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis|first=John J.|author2=Plummer, Ken |year=2005|title=Sociology. A Global Introduction|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Harlow|edition=3rd|page=12|isbn=0-13-128746-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, also in China, [[Mozi]] (''circa'' 470 – ''circa'' 390 BCE) recommended a more pragmatic sociology, but ethical at base.

In the West, [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] (354–430) was concerned exclusively with the idea of the ''just society''. St. Augustine describes late [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] society through a lens of hatred and contempt for what he saw as false [[deity|Gods]], and in reaction theorized [[City of God (book)|City of God]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} [[Ancient Greek]] philosophers, including [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) and [[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC), did not see a distinction between politics and society.  The concept of society did not come until  the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment period]].  The term, ''société'', was probably first used as key concept by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] in discussion of social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heilbron, Johan |title=The Rise of Social Theory |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the enlightenment, social theory took largely [[narrative]] and [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] form. It was expressed as stories and fables, and it may be assumed the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers and religious teachers were the precursors to social theory proper.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Medieval===
{{Main article|Sociology in medieval Islam|Muqaddimah|Asabiyyah}}

There is evidence of [[early Muslim sociology]] from the 14th century: in [[Ibn Khaldun]]'s ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (later translated as ''Prolegomena'' in [[Latin]]), the introduction to a seven volume analysis of [[universal history]], was the first to advance [[social philosophy]] and [[social science]] in formulating theories of [[Structural cohesion|social cohesion]] and [[social conflict]]. [[Ibn Khaldun]] is thus considered by many to be the forerunner of sociology.&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Akhtar&gt;Dr. S. W. Akhtar (1997). "The Islamic Concept of Knowledge", ''Al-Tawhid: A Quarterly Journal of Islamic Thought &amp; Culture'' '''12''' (3).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Khaldun|Khaldun's]] treatise described in ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' ''(Introduction to History)'', published in 1377, two types of societies: (1) the city or [[town]]-dweller and (2) the mobile, [[nomadic]] societies.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== European social thought ===
[[Modernity]] arose during the Enlightenment period, with the emergence of the [[world economy]] and exchange among diverse societies, bringing sweeping changes and new challenges for society.  Many [[France|French]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] intellectuals and [[philosopher]]s embraced the idea of progress and ideas of modernity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The Enlightenment period was marked by the idea was that with new [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]] challenging the traditional way of thinking, scientists were required to find new normativity. This process allowed [[scientific knowledge]] and society to [[Social progress|progress]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}  French thought during this period focused on [[moral]] critique and criticisms of the [[monarchy]].&lt;ref name="Callinicos" /&gt;{{rp|15}} These ideas did not draw on ideas of the past from classical thinkers, nor involved following [[religion|religious]] teachings and authority of the [[monarch]]. 

A common factor among the classical theories was the agreement that the [[history of humanity]] is pursuing a fixed path. They differed on where that path would lead: [[social progress]], [[technological progress]], decline or even fall. Social cycle theorists were skeptical of the Western achievements and technological progress, but argued that progress is an illusion of the ups and downs of the historical cycles. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The classical approach has been criticized by many modern sociologists and theorists; among them [[Karl Popper]], [[Robert Nisbet]], [[Charles Tilly]] and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].

The 19th century brought questions involving [[social order]].  The [[French Revolution]] freed French society of control by the monarchy, with no effective means of maintaining social order until [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] came to power.  Three great classical theories of social and historical change emerged: the [[social evolutionism]] theory (of which [[Social Darwinism]] forms a part), the [[social cycle theory]], and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[historical materialism]] theory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

19th-century classical social theory has been expanded upon to create newer, contemporary social theories such as [[Multilineal evolution|multilineal theories of evolution]] ([[neoevolutionism]], [[sociobiology]], [[theory of modernization]], [[theory of post-industrial society]]) and various strains of [[Neo-Marxism]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, social theory became closely related to academic [[sociology]], and other related studies such as [[anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[social work]] branched out into their own disciplines. Subjects like "[[philosophy of history]]" and other multi-disciplinary subject matter became part of social theory as taught under sociology.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A revival of discussion free of disciplines began in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The [[Frankfurt School|Frankfurt Institute for Social Research]] is a historical example. The [[Committee on Social Thought]] at the [[University of Chicago]] followed in the 1940s. In the 1970s, programs in [[Social and Political Thought]] were established at [[University of Sussex|Sussex]] and [[York University|York]]. Others followed, with emphases and structures, such as [[Social Theory and History]] ([[University of California, Davis]]). [[Cultural Studies]] programs extended the concerns of social theory into the domain of [[culture]] and thus [[anthropology]]. A chair and undergraduate program in social theory was established at the [[University of Melbourne]]. Social theory at present seems to be gaining acceptance as a classical academic discipline.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==== Classical social theory ====
{{Main|History of sociology}}
[[Adam Ferguson]], [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], among others, were the first to study society as distinct from political institutions and processes.  In the nineteenth century, the [[scientific method]] was introduced into study of society, which was a significant advance leading to development of [[sociology]] as a [[discipline]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In the 18th century, the pre-classical period of social theories developed a new form that provides the basic ideas for social theory, such as: [[evolution]], [[philosophy of history]], social life and [[social contract]], public and general will, competition in social space, [[organistic pattern]] for social description.
[[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], in ''The Spirit of Laws'', which established that social elements influence human nature, was possibly the first to suggest a universal explanation for [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Althusser, L. |title=Politics and History |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Montesquieu included changes in [[mores]] and manners as part of his explanation of political and historic events.&lt;ref name="Callinicos" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

Philosophers, including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Denis Diderot]], developed new social ideas during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period that were based on [[reason]] and methods of scientific inquiry.  [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in this time played a significant role in social theory. He revealed the origin of [[Social inequality|inequality]], analyzed the social contract (and social compact) that forms [[social integration]] and defined the social sphere or [[civil society]]. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] also emphasized that man has the liberty to change his world, an assertion that made it possible to program and change society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[Adam Smith]] addressed the question of whether vast inequalities of wealth represented progress.  He explained that the wealthy often demand [[convenience]], employing numerous others to carry out [[employment|labor]] to meet their demands.{{Citation needed| date= March 2018}}  Smith argued that this allows wealth to be redistributed among inhabitants, and for all to share in progress of society.  Smith explained that social forces could regulate the [[market economy]] with social objectivity and without need for [[government]] intervention.  Smith regarded the [[division of labor]] as an important factor for economic progress.  [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]] suggested that improved status of [[women]] was important for progress of society.  Millar also advocated for [[Abolitionism|abolition]] of [[slavery]], suggesting that personal [[liberty]] makes people more industrious, ambitious, and [[productivity|productive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Meek, Rodney L. |title=Economics and Ideology and Other Essays |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "modern" social theories (known as classical theories) that begin to resemble the analytic social theory of today developed simultaneously with the birth of the science of sociology. [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857), known as the "father of sociology" and regarded by some as the first philosopher of science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/comte/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=19 October 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=19 October 2017|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the groundwork for [[positivism]] – as well as [[structural functionalism]] and [[social evolutionism]]. [[Karl Marx]] rejected Comtean positivism but nevertheless aimed to establish a ''science of society'' based on [[historical materialism]], becoming recognised as a founding figure of sociology posthumously. At the turn of the 20th century, the first of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], developed sociological [[antipositivism]]. The field may be broadly recognized as an amalgam of three modes of social scientific thought in particular; Durkheimian [[sociological positivism]] and [[structural functionalism]], Marxist historical materialism and [[conflict theory]], and Weberian [[antipositivism]] and [[verstehen]] critique.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Another early modern theorist, [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903), coined the term "[[survival of the fittest]]". [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848–1923) and [[Pitirim A. Sorokin]] argued that "history goes in cycles," and presented the [[social cycle theory]] to illustrate their point. [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] (1855–1936) made ''community'' and ''society'' (''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]'', 1887) the special topics of the new science of "sociology", both of them based on different modes of [[will (philosophy)|will]] of [[social actor]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The 19th century pioneers of social theory and sociology, like Saint-Simon, Comte, Marx, [[John Stuart Mill]] or Spencer, never held university posts and they were broadly regarded as philosophers. Emile Durkheim endeavoured to formally established academic sociology, and did so at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, he published ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]''. In 1896, he established the journal ''[[Année Sociologique|L'Année Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or [[philosophy]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

====Post-modern social theory====
{{Further information|post-modern feminism|postmodernism|post-structuralism}}
The term "postmodernism" was brought into social theory in 1971 by the Arab American Theorist [[Ihab Hassan]] in his book: ''The Dismemberment of Orpheus: Toward a Postmodern Literature''. In 1979 [[Jean-François Lyotard]] wrote a short but influential work ''[[The Postmodern Condition|The Postmodern Condition: A report on knowledge]]''. [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Roland Barthes]] were influential in the 1970s in developing postmodern theory.

Scholars most commonly hold ''[[postmodernism]]'' to be a movement of ideas arising from, but also critical of elements of [[modernism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The wide range of uses of this term resulted in different elements of modernity are chosen as being continuous. Each of the different uses is rooted in some argument about the nature of knowledge, known in philosophy as [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allan, H Turnner|first=Kenneth, Jonathan|last2=Turner|first2=Jonathan H.|year=2000|title=A formalization of postmodern theory|journal=Sociological Perspectives|volume=43|issue=3|pages=363|doi=10.2307/1389533|issn=0731-1214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who use the term are arguing that either there is something fundamentally different about the transmission of meaning, or that modernism has fundamental flaws in its system of knowledge. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The argument for the necessity of the term states that economic and technological conditions of our age have given rise to a decentralized, media-dominated society. {{Citation needed| date= March 2018}} These ideas are [[simulacra]], and only inter-referential representations and copies of each other, with no real original, stable or objective source for [[communication]] and meaning. [[Globalization]], brought on by innovations in communication, [[manufacturing]] and [[transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=L Arxer|first=Steven|year=2008|title=Addressing postmodern concerns on the border: globalization, the nation-state, hybridity, and social change|journal=Tamara Journal of Critical Organisation Inquiry|volume=7|issue=1/2|pages=179|issn=1532-5555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization is cited as one force which has decentralized modern life, creating a culturally pluralistic and interconnected global society, lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication, or intellectual production. The postmodern view is that inter-subjective knowledge, and not objective knowledge, is the dominant form of [[discourse]]. The ubiquity of copies and dissemination alters the relationship between reader and what is read, between observer and the observed, between those who consume and those who produce.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} 

Not all people who use the term postmodern or postmodernism see these developments as positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petrov|first=Igor|year=2003|title=Globalization as a Postmodern Phenomenon|journal=International Affairs|volume=49|issue=6|pages=127|issn=0130-9641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users of the term argue that their ideals have arisen as the result of particular economic and social conditions, including "[[late capitalism]]", the growth of [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] media, and that such conditions have pushed society into a new [[historical period]].

====Today====
In the past few decades, in response to postmodern critiques, {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} social theory has begun to stress free will, individual choice, subjective reasoning, and the importance of unpredictable events in place of [[determinism|deterministic necessity]]. [[Rational choice theory]], [[symbolic interactionism]], [[False necessity]] are examples of more recent developments. A view among contemporary sociologists is that there are no great unifying 'laws of history', but rather smaller, more specific, and more complex laws that govern society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] recently attempted to revise classical social theory by exploring how things fit together, rather than to provide an all encompassing single explanation of a universal reality. He begins by recognizing the key insight of classical social theory of society as an artifact, and then by discarding the law-like characteristics forcibly attached to it. Unger argues that classical social theory was born proclaiming that society is made and imagined, and not the expression of an underlying natural order, but at the same time its capacity was checked by the equally prevalent ambition to create law-like explanations of history and social development. The [[human sciences]] that developed claimed to identify a small number of possible types of social organization that coexisted or succeeded one another through inescapable developmental tendencies or deep-seated economic organization or psychological constraints. [[Marxism]] is the star example.&lt;ref name="Unger"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Theory: Its situation and its task|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

Unger, calling his efforts "super-theory", has thus sought to develop a comprehensive view of history and society. Unger does so without subsuming deep structure analysis under an indivisible and repeatable type of social organization or with recourse to law-like constraints and tendencies.&lt;ref name="Unger" /&gt;{{rp|165}} His articulation of such a theory is in ''False Necessity: anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy,'' where he uses deep-logic practice to theorize human social activity through anti-necessitarian analysis.

Unger begins by formulating the theory of false necessity, which claims that social worlds are the artifact of human endeavors. There is no pre-set institutional arrangement that societies must adhere to, and there is no necessary historical mold of development that they will follow. We are free to choose and to create the forms and the paths that our societies will take. However, this does not give license to absolute contingency. Unger finds that there are groups of institutional arrangements that work together to bring about certain institutional forms—liberal democracy, for example. These forms are the basis of a social structure, which Unger calls [[formative context]]. In order to explain how we move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and [[anti-necessitarian social thought]], Unger recognized that there are an infinite number of ways of resisting social and institutional constraints, which can lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and [[empowered democracy|empowerment]] make change possible. Unger calls this empowerment [[negative capability]]. However, Unger adds that these outcomes are always reliant on the forms from which they spring. The new world is built upon the existing one.&lt;ref name="fn 35"&gt;{{cite book|title=False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition|last=Unger|first=Roberto|publisher=Verso|year=2004|isbn=978-1-85984-331-4|location=London|pages=35–36, 164, 169, 278–80, 299–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==

===Chicago school===
{{Main|Chicago School (sociology)}}
The [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] developed in the 1920s, through the work of [[Albion Woodbury Small]], [[W. I. Thomas]], [[Ernest W. Burgess]], [[Robert E. Park]], [[Ellsworth Faris]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and other sociologists at the [[University of Chicago]].  The Chicago school focused on patterns and arrangement of social phenomenon across [[time]] and [[Location (geography)|place]], and within context of other social variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abbott, Andrew|year=1997|title=Of Time and Space: The Contemporary Relevance of the Chicago School|journal=Social Forces|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|volume=75|issue=4|pages=1149–82|doi=10.2307/2580667|jstor=2580667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical theory===
{{Main|Critical theory}}
[[Critical theory (Frankfurt School)|Critical theorists]] rejected the "objective", scientific approach, and sought to frame theories within [[ideology|ideologies]] of [[human freedom]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Marxism===
{{Main|Marxism}}
[[Karl Marx]] wrote and theorized about the importance of [[political economy]] on society, and focused on the "material conditions" of life.&lt;ref name="Callinicos" /&gt;{{rp|4}} His theories centered around capitalism and its affect on class-struggle between the  [[proletariat]] and [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm|title=The German Ideology. Karl Marx 1845|last=Marx|first=Karl|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postmodernism===
{{Main|Postmodernism}}
Postmodernism was defined by [[Jean-François Lyotard]] as "incredulity towards [[metanarratives]]" and contrasted that with [[Modernism|modern]] which he described as "any science that legitimates itself with reference to a [[metadiscourse]]... making an explicit appeal to some grand narrative, such as the dialectics of Spirit the hermeneutics of meaning, the emancipation of the rational or working subject, or the creation of wealth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition|author=Lyotard, Jean-François|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other perspectives===
Other theories include:
* [[Social constructionist theory]]
* [[Rational choice theory]]
* [[Structural functionalism]] – influenced by Spencer and Durkheim
* [[Social action]] – influenced by Weber and Pareto
* [[Conflict theory]] – influenced by Marx, Simmel

===British social thought===
[[Great Britain|British]] social thought, with thinkers such as [[Herbert Spencer]], addressed questions and ideas relating to [[political economy]] and [[social evolution]]. The political ideals of [[John Ruskin]] were a precursor of [[social economy]] (''[[Unto This Last]]'' had a very important impact on [[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s philosophy).

===Italian sociology===
Important Italian social scientists include [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Gaetano Mosca]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], Franco Ferrarotti.

==In academic practices==
Social theory seeks to question why humans inhabit the world the way they do, and how that came to be by looking at power relations, social structures, and  social norms,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56608295|title=Modern social theory : an introduction|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Harrington, Austin, 1970-|isbn=9780199255702|location=Oxford|oclc=56608295}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also examining how humans relate to each other and the society they find themselves in, how this has changed over time and in different cultures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/232358185|title=Contemporary social theory : an introduction|last=1964-|first=Elliott, Anthony,|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415386333|location=London|oclc=232358185}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the tools used to measure those things. Social theory looks to [[interdisciplinarity]], combining knowledge from multiple academic disciplines in order to enlighten these complex issues,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and can draw on ideas from fields as diverse as [[anthropology]] and [[media studies]]. 

Social theory guides scientific inquiry by promoting scientists to think about which topics are suitable for investigation and how they should measure them. Selecting or creating appropriate theory for use in examining an issue is an important skill for any researcher. Important distinctions: a ''theoretical orientation'' (or [[paradigm]]) is a worldview, the lens through which one organizes experience (i.e. thinking of human interaction in terms of power or exchange). A ''theory'' is an attempt to explain and predict behavior in particular contexts. A theoretical orientation cannot be proven or disproven; a theory can. 

Having a theoretical orientation that sees the world in terms of power and control, one could create a theory about violent human behavior which includes specific causal statements (e.g. being the victim of physical abuse leads to psychological problems). This could lead to a [[hypothesis]] (prediction) about what one expects to see in a particular sample, e.g. "a battered child will grow up to be shy or violent". One can then test the hypothesis by looking to see if it is consistent with [[data]]. One might, for instance, review hospital records to find children who were abused, then track them down and administer a personality test to see if they show signs of being violent or shy. The selection of an appropriate (i.e. useful) theoretical orientation within which to develop a potentially helpful theory is the bedrock of social science.

=== Example of questions posed by social theorists ===
Philosophical questions addressed by social thinkers often centered around [[modernity]], including:
* Can human reason make sense of the social world and shape it for the better?
* Did the development of modern societies, with vast inequalities in wealth among citizens, constitute progress?
* How do particular government interventions and regulations impact natural social processes?
* Should the economy/market be regulated or not?
Other issues relating to modernity that were addressed by social thinkers include [[Atomism (social)|social atomization]], [[Social alienation|alienation]], [[loneliness]], [[social disorganization]], and [[secularization]].

'''Start Making A Reader Today''' (SMART) is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]], [[Volunteering|volunteer]]-driven tutoring program local to [[Oregon]] for at-risk K-3 readers. SMART was developed by [[Neil Goldschmidt]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;Baker, Scott, Russell Gersten and Thomas Keating. ''[http://getsmartoregon.org/ourmission/documents/Reading%20Research%20Quarterly%20Dec%20%2700.pdf When less may be more: A 2-year longitudinal evaluation of a volunteer tutoring program requiring minimal training]''. Reading Research Quarterly, Volume 35, Number 4; Oct-Dec. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; It has grown from serving 585 children at 8 schools at its inception&lt;ref name="programOverview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Overview|publisher=SMART|url=http://getsmartoregon.org/ourmission/documents/Program%20Overview.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to serving 7,244 children at 204 sites in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://getsmartoregon.org/aboutus/documents/SMART%20Annual%20Report%20FY09.pdf Smart Annual Report 2008-2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and 223 sites in 2011.&lt;ref name="oregonian-dec2011"/&gt;  As of December 2011, the organization's annual budget was $2.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="oregonian-dec2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Row|first=D.K.|title=Getting SMART about success|date=December 16, 2011&lt;!--(online date Dec. 15)--&gt;|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=E1|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/living/index.ssf/2011/12/getting_smart_about_success.html |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program concept involves each student getting one-on-one attention twice a week for 30 minutes as they read to a volunteer to help boost their confidence in their reading ability. Additionally, the students get to take two books home each month over the seven months the program runs each year (mid-October to mid-May), in order to make more reading material available at home.&lt;ref name="oregonian-dec2011"/&gt;

The program's effectiveness is backed by a [[Longitudinal study|two-year study]] performed at the Eugene Research Institute which indicates SMART students outperform similar students in word identification and word comprehension by nearly a half [[standard deviation]].&lt;ref name="study"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://evidencebasedprograms.org/wordpress/?page_id=85 Social Programs That Work: SMART]&lt;/ref&gt;

SMART aims to partner foremost with schools that have a high percentage of children from [[Poverty|low-income]] families. School staff interviews, community support, and information from the [[Oregon Department of Education]] also influence school selection.&lt;ref name="programOverview"/&gt;

In 2010, SMART participated in [[Pepsi]]'s Refresh Challenge and running for the $250,000 prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refresheverything.com/smartreading Pepsi Refresh Challenge: SMART]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stemettes''' is a [[social enterprise]] which encourages girls aged between 5–22 years old to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths, or [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]. Stemettes runs panel events, [[hackathon]]s, the Student to Stemette mentoring programme supported by [[Deutsche Bank]], Outbox Incubator and an app, OtotheB, an online platform for girls interested in STEM and [[entrepreneurship]].

==History==
Stemettes was started in 2013 by British mathematics and computing child prodigy [[Anne-Marie Imafidon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Lydia|title=Women in Science: Meet the Stemettes star inspiring more girls into STEM|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/women-science-meet-stemettes-star-inspiring-more-girls-into-stem-1543094|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Jacquelyn Guderley became co-founder of Stemettes alongside Imafidon.{{clarify|reason=makes no sense - if she joined 2 years after it was started then she cannot be co-founder|date=December 2017}}

Stemettes has partnered with organisations including [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Salesforce]], [[Accenture]], [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[BP]] and [[Microsoft]]. The organisation is regularly called upon by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] and [[European Commission]] to consult on matters related to women in STEM.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Outbox Incubator==
For six weeks from July–August 2015, Stemettes ran Outbox Incubator in London. This residential business incubator for girls with STEM start-ups became known as the “X-men house for girls”&lt;ref&gt;Ravanona, Anna.

In February 2016, the Outbox Incubator spin-off app, OtotheB, was officially launched. The app is an online platform for girls interested in STEM and entrepreneurship. The app has been well received by some STEM figures such as academic and campaigner [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], who described the app as a “…fantastic new resource for young women interested in technology”.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, John.

==Awards and recognition==
Stemettes was named as European Digital Impact Organisation of the Year in October 2014 &lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalimpactaward.com/2014/11/01/2014-european-digital-impact-organisation 2014 European Digital Impact Organisation],[http://dlii.org/ Digital Leadership Institute].

      <comment>The use of [sic] here is bizarre, and implies that the usage is incorrect when it is not.  Anyone who doesn't know the meanings of the verb "to bear" can look it up in a dictionary.  And why would it be marked with a [sic] in Mormon usage, but not in the reference to Quaker usage?</comment>

{{Evidence law}}
In [[law]] and in [[religion]], '''testimony''' is a solemn attestation as to the truth of a matter.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary}}
The words "testimony" and "testify" both derive from the [[Latin]] word ''testis'', referring to the notion of a disinterested [[Third-party source|third-party]] witness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=testify|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=testify |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=testimony|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=testimony |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==

In the [[law]], testimony is a form of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] that is obtained from a [[witness]] who makes a solemn statement or declaration of fact. Testimony may be oral or written, and it is usually made by [[oath]] or [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] under penalty of [[perjury]]. To be admissible in court and for maximum reliability and validity, written testimony is usually witnessed by one or more persons who swear or affirm its authenticity also under penalty of perjury. Unless a witness is testifying as an [[expert witness]], testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is generally limited to those opinions or inferences that are rationally based on the perceptions of the witness and are helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony. 

Legitimate expert witnesses with a genuine understanding of legal process and the inherent dangers of false or misleading testimony refrain from making statements of fact. They also recognize that they are in fact not witnesses to an alleged crime or other event in any way, shape or form. Their expertise is in the examination of evidence or relevant facts in the case. They should make no firm judgement or claim or accusation about any aspect of the case outside their narrow range of expertise. They also should not allege any fact they can't immediately and credibly prove scientifically.
 
For example, a hair sample from a crime scene entered as evidence by the prosecution should be described by an expert witness as "consistent with" a sample collected from the defendant, rather than being described as a "match". A wide range of factors make it physically impossible to prove for certain that two hair or tissue samples came from a common source.

Having not actually witnessed the defendant at the scene, the expert witness can not state for a fact that the sample is a match to the defendant, particularly when the samples were collected at different times and different places by different collectors using different collection methods. Ultimately, the testimony of expert witnesses is regarded as supportive of evidence rather than evidence in and of itself, and a good defense attorney will point out that the expert witness is not in fact a witness to anything, but rather an observer.

When a witness is asked a question, the opposing attorney can raise an [[Objection (law)|objection]], which is a legal move to disallow or prevent an improper question to others, preferably before the witness answers, and mentioning one of the standard reasons, including:
* argumentative
* asked and answered
* [[best evidence rule]]
* calls for speculation
* calls for a conclusion
* [[compound question]] or narrative
* [[hearsay]]
* inflammatory
* incompetent witness (e.g., child, mental or physical impairment, intoxicated)
* irrelevant, immaterial (the words "irrelevant" and "immaterial" have the same meaning under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Historically, irrelevant evidence referred to evidence that has no probative value, i.e., does not tend to prove any fact. Immaterial refers to evidence that is probative, but not as to any fact material to the case. See Black's Law Dictionary, 7th Ed.).
* lack of foundation
* [[leading question]]
* [[privilege (evidence)|privilege]]
* vague
* [[ultimate issue (law)|ultimate issue testimony]]
There may also be an objection to the answer, including:
* non-responsive

Up until the mid-20th century, in much of the [[United States]], an attorney often had to follow an objection with an '''exception''' to preserve the issue for appeal. If an attorney failed to "take an exception" immediately after the court's ruling on the objection, he waived his client's right to appeal the issue. Exceptions have since been abolished, due to the widespread recognition that forcing lawyers to take them was a waste of time.

When a party uses the testimony of a witness to show proof, the opposing party often attempts to [[Witness impeachment|impeach]] the witness. This may be done using [[cross-examination]], calling into question the witness's [[Competence (law)|competence]], or by attacking the [[Character evidence|character]] or [[Habit evidence|habit]] of the witness. So, for example, if a witness testifies that he remembers seeing a person at 2:00 pm on a Tuesday and his habit is to be at his desk job on Tuesday, then the opposing party would try to impeach his testimony related to that event.

==Religion==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fasting]] --&gt;
[[Christians]] in general, especially within the [[Evangelical]] tradition, use the term "to testify" or "to give one's testimony" to mean "to tell the story of how one became a Christian". Commonly it may refer to a specific event in a Christian's life in which they believe God did something deemed particularly worth sharing. Christians often give their testimony at their own [[baptism]] or at [[evangelistic]] events. Many Christians have also published their testimonies on the internet.

===Types===
Many [[Holiness movement|holiness]] churches devote a portion of their mid-week service to allow members to give a personal testimony about their faith and experiences in living the Christian life.

In the [[Religious Society of Friends]], the word ''testimony'' is used to refer to the ways in which [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] ''testify'' or ''bear witness'' to their beliefs in their everyday lives. In this context, the word ''testimony'' refers not to the underlying belief, but the committed action which arises out of their beliefs, which ''testifies'' to their beliefs. Common areas which modern [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] are said to testify are [[peace testimony|testimony towards peace]], [[testimony of simplicity|testimony to simplicity]], [[testimony of integrity|testimony to truth and integrity]], [[testimony of equality|testimony to equality]].

In some [[religion]]s (most notably [[Mormonism]] and [[Islam]]) many adherents testify as a profession of their [[faith]], often to a congregation of believers. In [[Mormonism]], testifying is also referred to as "bearing one's testimony," and often involves the sharing of personal experience—ranging from a simple anecdote to an account of [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)#Personal revelation|personal revelation]]—followed by a statement of belief that has been confirmed by this experience. Within [[Mormon]] [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|culture]], the word "testimony"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://lds.org/study/topics/testimony?lang=eng |contribution= Testimony |title= Gospel Study: Study by Topic |work= LDS.org |publisher= [[LDS Church]] |date= |accessdate= 2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become synonymous with "belief." Although testimony and belief are often used interchangeably, they are inherently different. Most Mormons believe that when faith is acted upon, individuals can receive a spiritual witness which solidifies belief into testimony. Mormons are taught that if the exercise of faith brings forth good works, they can know their religious principles are true. An individual who no longer believes in the religion is referred to as having "lost their testimony."

==Literature==
[[File:Bataan Death March Testimonies.jpg|thumb|[[Bataan Death March|Bataan Death March Testimonies]]]]
Some published [[oral history|oral]] or written [[autobiography|autobiographical]] [[narrative]]s are considered "testimonial [[literature]]" particularly when they present [[evidence (law)|evidence]] or [[first-person narrative|first person]] accounts of [[human rights]] abuses, [[violence]] and [[war]], and living under conditions of social [[oppression]]. This usage of the term comes originally from [[Latin America]] and the Spanish term ''"testimonio"'' when it emerged from human rights [[tribunal]]s,  [[truth commissions]], and other [[international human rights instruments]] in countries such as [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. One of the most famous, though controversial, of these works to be translated into English is ''[[I, Rigoberta Menchú]]''. The autobiographies of [[Frederick Douglass]] can be considered among the earliest significant English-language works in this [[genre]].

==Philosophy==
In [[philosophy]], a testimony is known as statements that are based on personal experience or personal knowledge. A statement is accepted on the basis of person's testimony if his or her asserting it renders it acceptable. We can also, rationally accept a claim on the basis of another person's testimony unless at least one of the following is found to be true:
# The claim is implausible;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6861">'''''The Other Canon Foundation''''' is a center and network for research of [[heterodox economics]] founded by [[Erik Reinert]]. The name refers to the founders' message of there being another economic canon, alternative to the ruling [[neoclassical economics]]. Their suggestions, they claim, are valid for and can be applicated in the first, second and third world.&lt;ref name="othercanon1"&gt;http://www.othercanon.org/papers/organisation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Other Canon was founded in 2000 by Erik Reinert and 10 co-founders with different backgrounds in economics and social sciences. The founders also have distinct backgrounds coming from North America, Latin America, Asia, Eastern and Western Europe. Notable names among them are [[Wolfgang Drechsler]], [[Carlota Perez]] and [[Geoffrey Hodgson]]. In addition to the executive chairman Erik Reinert and the earlier mentioned Drechsler, the current executive board also employs [[Rainer Kattel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.othercanon.org/board/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories and influences ==
The ideological foundation of The Other Canon is not defined in a left-right perspective, claiming both sides have fallen into the same traps failing to explain and develop valid theories for today's economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.othercanon.org/uploads/The%20other%20Canon%2011%2099.doc#32;other Canon 11 99.doc ''The Other Canon - Reconstructing the Theory of Uneven Economic Development'']&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the group is the [[Theory of Uneven Development]], which aims to explain how and why the international economic landscape (of rich and poor nations) is as it is today. History of Economic Policy is used as an important tool in this process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.othercanon.org/documenting/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Other Canon is highly eclectic and gathers ideas from many authors of various epochs. [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Gunnar Myrdal]], [[Gustav von Schmoller]], [[Werner Sombart]], [[Nicholas Kaldor]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Adam Smith]] (for considerations of the primary sector) are among the theorists to have influenced The Other Canon.

In accordance with Schumpeter, The Other Canon emphasizes the role of "man the producer" over "man the consumer" and intends to seek the reasons for growth and innovation rather than seeing it as something innate to capital and a simple result of adding it to human labour. They argue that the state is needed to stimulate entrepreneurship to maximise growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.othercanon.org/uploads/State%20paper.doc#32;paper.doc Erik Reinert. ''The Role of the State in Economic Growth'']&lt;/ref&gt;
The importance of role of the state is also underlined in development economics. In his book ''[[How Rich Countries Got Rich ... and Why Poor Countries Stay Poor]]'' (2007), Reinert criticises liberal economists for ignoring empirical evidence when they promote free-trade as the solution to third world countries. He claims poor countries should, and should be allowed to, use protectionism to build up their own industries until they can compete internationally and that the state should be involved in this process.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Reinert. How Rich Countries Got Rich ... and Why Poor Countries Stay Poor (2007), London: Constable.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences to and criticism of the mainstream economics ==
Much of The Others Canon's criticism of the mainstream economics regards the focus on equilibrium and the static, as well as what the neoclassical models takes as given (perfect information, perfect foresight, constant [[returns to scale]] and no diversity/likeness of economic activity). Conforming with Schumpeterian theory The Other Canon emphasises the constant change in the economy and that entrepreneurs and capitalists all the time create temporary monopolies based on advantages of knowledge and/or uncertain assumptions about the future. The fact that mainstream economics sees innovation and novelty, and hence growth (of which capitalism is absolutely dependent), as exogenous phenomena does not fall lightly with The Other Canon who sees these factors as pivotal to the economy and something that is maximised through stimulation in the form of state policy.
The Other Canon claims reintroducing increasing and diminishing (decreasing) returns to scale can help us understand the economic development and why neo-classical economy has failed to explain the uneven development of nations. Reinerts claims poor country's concentrating their production on industries with diminishing returns to scale will lead them to become more inefficient the more they invest while the opposite thing will happen to the rich countries with their primarily increasing returns to scale industries. This, he argues, is why following [[David Ricardo|Ricardian Economics]], mainly his theory of [[comparative advantage]], will, instead of leading to the factor price equalisation neo-liberals profess, in fact usher poor countries into "specialising in being poor and inefficient".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.othercanon.org/uploads/SUM%20paper%20diminishing%20returns.doc#32;paper Reinert, Erik S. 'Diminishing Returns and Economic Sustainability; The Dilemma of Resource-based Economies under a Free Trade Regime.'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]], however, takes use of increasing returns to scale in his [[New Trade Theory]] to explain the success of the industrialised countries, but leaves out diminishing returns to scale explaining the misery of the [[Third World]].
The view of the economy as largely independent from society and the financial sector not being distinct from the real economy are also disputed by The Other Canon claiming that the economy is indeed embedded into society and that conflicts between the financial sector are normal and hence must be regulated.&lt;ref name="othercanon1"/&gt;

== Publishing ==
Since 2009, The Other Canon has its own book publishing series with Anthem Press in London,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anthempress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; called TAOCS - The Anthem Other Canon Series. So far, publications include 
*a new biography of [[Joseph Alois Schumpeter]] by Schumpeter Society&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iss-evec.de/&lt;/ref&gt; chairman [[Esben Sloth Andersen]]
*a [[Festschrift]] for [[Carlota Perez]], on ''Techno-Economic Paradigms'', edited by [[Wolfgang Drechsler]] and others
*a re-edition of the complete English works of [[Ragnar Nurkse]] and a volume on Nurkse edited by [[Rainer Kattel]] and others
*a new edition of [[Bengt-Åke Lundvall]]'s work on National Innovation Systems
and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4176">The '''Secret of the Way Things Are''' (also called the '''Sapiential Work Scroll''') is considered a [[Wisdom literature|wisdom scroll]] among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. It is authored by a spiritual expert, directed towards a beginner. The author addresses how to deal with business and money issues in a godly manner, public affairs, leadership, marriage, children, and family, and how to live life righteously among secular society. The scrolls were found in [[Qumran]] caves one and four, and date approximately from the first century BCE and early first century CE.

==Description== 
Parts of six copies were discovered, indicating popularity and importance, especially to the supposed sect at Qumran. All of the Sapiential manuscripts are in [[Hebrew]], which is deemed the original language of the text (Harrington 2000: 825). The actual ancient title is unknown, but the frequent use of ''raz nihyeh'', translating to "the mystery of existence," "approaching mystery," or "the way things are" gave reason to title the work "The Secret of the Way Things are" (Davies, Brooke, and Callaway 2002: 140). A well-accepted theory is that the Sapiential Work was a pre-Qumranic text. In other words, it was not written for an isolated sect, but it ''was'' directed toward a specific audience (Elgvin 1996: 129). Many scholars assume the text to either have existed before the formation of the sect, or to have been a precursor to sect involvement (Harrington 2000: 826).

==Motifs==
Although the text itself is not considered [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]], and does not reflect the developed philosophical dualism of the [[War Rule|War Scroll]] or the [[Community Rule]] (1Qs), the text does reflect [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]s of the [[end time]]s, judgment, and a predestined division of good and evil. The overall ideas and form of the text are comparable to [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], Jesus' instructions and parables in the [[New Testament]] gospels, the [[book of James]], and especially the [[book of Daniel]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Parallels==
Although there is no literal dependence between Daniel and the Sapiential Works, it is likely that they emerged from the same, or similar, scribal circles. Many phrases and ideas from Daniel pertaining to wisdom, revelation, and the elect recur in "The Secret of the Way Things Are." Similarly, both books reflect scribal activity with "a quest for divine communication," and "neither are concerned with the sacrificial cult of the Temple" (Elgvin 1996 : 131). The Work is also analogous to New Testament scripture, with recurring similarities found in Proverbs and the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. Although the terminology is not consistently parallel, the ideas and themes are comparable. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Women==
An unusual aspect of this particular text is that it addresses women, which is very uncommon for an ancient Jewish text. 4Q413 appears to give advice to a woman, presumably the wife of the beginner being instructed (Harrington 2000: 826). This particular section uses feminine verbal forms, rather than the singular forms used throughout the rest of the instruction (Harrington 1996: 57).

==History==

The business was established in 2006 by Jeff Fairhall and Joe Whinney in the [[Fremont, Seattle|Fremont]] neighborhood of Seattle. The business is located in a [[Fremont Trolley Barn|former brewery building and trolleycar depot]] at 3400 Phinney Avenue.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Jeff Fairhall, the founder of Seattle's Essential Baking Company, invested in the establishment of Theo Chocolate with Joe Whinney.&lt;ref name=richman&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Jeff-Fairhall-1958-2007-Entrepreneur-pioneered-1250121.php |title=Jeff Fairhall, 1958-2007: Entrepreneur pioneered healthful food to go - seattlepi.com |first=Dan |last=Richman |work=seattlepi.com |date=19 September 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairhallobit"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2003894838_fairhallobit21m.html |title=Local News &amp;#124; Jeff Fairhall, owner of Essential Baking Co., dies at 49 |first=Susan |last=Gilmore |work=seattletimes.com |date=September 21, 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was in his early 20s, Whinney volunteered with a small conservation foundation in Southern [[Belize]] that was looking at the way that communities cultivated their crops. He developed a passion for the [[Theobroma cacao]] plant and wanted to get into the business while supporting the farmers, and contacted 10 bean processors. One responded. While providing this business with organic materials and customers, Whinney was able to start saving up to found a chocolate business of his own.&lt;ref name=Fair/&gt;

The business struggled to find a good supply of organic cocoa beans and came to a halt in 2002. After finding an interested investor in [[Seattle, Washington]], the decision was made to build the Theo Chocolate factory, named after the Theobroma cacao tree.&lt;ref name= Fair /&gt;

From 2004 to 2006 Fairhall sold all of his other business interests, retaining only Theo Chocolate. He published more than 30 advertisements in ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' about various religious ideas, revelations, and conspiracy theories. He also mentioned his use of [[Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushrooms]].&lt;ref name=richman/&gt; Fairhall died of brain cancer in 2007.&lt;ref name=richman/&gt;

In April 2018, Etienne Patout, a former Kellogg's executive, became the company's CEO.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.confectionerynews.com/Article/2018/04/13/Theo-Chocolate-names-former-Kellogg-exec-as-CEO&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Jewish Congress''' ('''WJC''') was founded in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], in August 1936 as an international federation of [[Jews|Jewish]] communities and organizations. According to its mission statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about|title=World Jewish Congress - About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; the World Jewish Congress' main purpose is to act as "the diplomatic arm of the Jewish people." Membership in the WJC is open to all representative Jewish groups or communities, irrespective of the social, political or economic ideology of the community's host country. The World Jewish Congress headquarters are in [[New York City]], US, and the organization maintains international offices in [[Brussels, Belgium]]; [[Jerusalem, Israel]]; [[Paris, France]]; [[Moscow, Russia]]; [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]; and [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. The WJC has [[List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council|special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council]].

== Organization and related bodies ==
The WJC is made up of five regional branches: WJC [[North America]], the Latin American Jewish Congress, the [[European Jewish Congress]], the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress, and the WJC Israel. Besides that, Jewish umbrella organizations in 100 countries are directly affiliated to the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about|title= World Jewish Congress - About Us|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its highest decision-making body is the Plenary Assembly, which meets every four years and elects the lay leadership (Executive Committee) of the WJC. In between plenary assemblies, meetings of the WJC Governing Board are normally held once a year. Affiliated Jewish organizations send delegates to these two WJC bodies; their number depends on the size of the Jewish communities they represent.

A special meeting of the Plenary Assembly, attended by over 400 delegates and observers from over 70 countries, was held in Buenos Aires in March 2015. The last regular plenary assembly was held In New York in April 2017, and prior to that in Budapest in May 2013, with 600 delegates and observers in attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/hungarian-prime-minister-to-address-world-jewish-congress-in-budapest.premium-1.519110|title=Hungarian Prime Minister to Address World Jewish Congress in Budapest|first=Judy|last=Maltz|date=3 May 2013|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the WJC's major programs is concerned with the plight of [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]]. The WJC is also involved in [[Religious pluralism|inter-faith dialogue]] with Christian and Muslim groups.

==History==
The World Jewish Congress was established in Geneva, [[Switzerland]] in August, 1936, in reaction to the rise of Nazism and the growing wave of European anti-Semitism. Since its foundation, it has been a permanent body with offices around the world. The main aims of the organization were "to mobilize the Jewish people and the democratic forces against the Nazi onslaught", to "fight for equal political and economic rights everywhere, and particularly for the Jewish minorities in Central and Eastern Europe", to support the establishment of a "Jewish National Home in Palestine" and to create "a worldwide Jewish representative body based on the concept of the unity of the Jewish people, democratically organized and able to act on matters of common concern".&lt;ref name="Garai"&gt;George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936-1976, Geneva 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/holocaust/0131_World_Jewish_Congress.html|title=World Jewish Collection – An Introduction by Nolan Altman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursor organizations (1917-1936)===
The WJC's precursor organizations were the [[American Jewish Congress]] and the ''Comité des Délégations Juives'' (Committee of Jewish Delegations). The latter was established in March 1919 to represent Jewish communities at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], and advocated for Jewish minority rights in various countries, including the negotiation of rights for Jews in Turkey in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (1920) and special agreements with smaller eastern European states. Headed by Russian Zionist [[Leo Motzkin]], the ''Comité des Délégations Juives'' was composed of delegations from Palestine, the United States, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, East Galicia, Romania, Transylvania, Bukovina, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece, and funded mainly by the [[World Zionist Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Unity in Dispersion: A History of the World Jewish Congress, World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 26-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631187288_chunk_g97806311872888_ss1-198|author=Blackwell Reference Online|title=Comité des Délégations Juives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanjewisharchives.org/aja/FindingAids/ms0361/ |title= A Collection Overview to the World Jewish Congress Records. 1918-1982.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first impetus for the creation of the WJC came from the [[American Jewish Congress]]. In December 1917, the AJC adopted a resolution calling for the "convening of a World Jewish Congress", "as soon as peace is declared among the warring nations" in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, Motzkin visited the United States and addressed the AJC Executive Committee, "pleading for a World Conference of Jews to discuss the conditions of Jews in various lands and to devise ways and means for effective protection of Jewish rights."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; Conferences co-organized by Motzkin and the AJC leaders [[Julian Mack]] and [[Stephen Wise]] took place in 1926 in London and in 1927 in Zurich, Switzerland. The latter was attended by 65 Jews from 13 countries, representing 43 Jewish organizations, though the main Jewish groups in Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, as well as the [[American Jewish Committee]], declined the invitation to attend.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Preparatory World Jewish Conference was held in Geneva in August 1932. A preparatory committee was headed by Zionist [[Nahum Goldmann]], who was one of the leading advocates of the establishment of an international Jewish representative body.&lt;ref name="Garai, pg. 10 and 20"&gt;Garai, pg. 10 and 20&lt;/ref&gt; Goldmann defined the purpose of the World Jewish Congress as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is to establish the permanent address of the Jewish people; amidst the fragmentation and atomization of Jewish life and of the Jewish community; it is to establish a real, legitimate, collective representation of Jewry which will be entitled to speak in the name of the 16 million Jews to the nations and governments of the world, as well as to the Jews themselves.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conference approved plans to set up the new organization in 1934, with headquarters in New York and European offices in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1932"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1932/08/18/2795280/geneva-conference-approves-call-for-world-jewish-congress-in-summer-of-1934|author=JTA|title=Geneva Conference Approves Call for World Jewish Congress in Summer of 1934, 18 August 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="americanjewisharchives.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanjewisharchives.org/aja/FindingAids/ms0361/|title= A Collection Overview to the World Jewish Congress Records. 1918-1982.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a manifesto, delegates called upon the Jewish people to unite as the only effective means of averting danger. The Jews, the declaration said, had to rely on their own power with the assistance of such enlightened sections of the world which had not yet been saturated with poisonous anti-Semitism. It added: "The World Jewish Congress does not aim at weakening any existing organizations, but rather to support and stimulate them."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1932"/&gt; The new organization would be based on the "concept of the Jewish people as a national entity, and authorized and obligated to deal with all problems affecting Jewish life."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1933, following the rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and his NSDAP in Germany, [[American Jewish Congress]] President Bernard Deutsch called on US Jewish organizations to support the establishment of a World Jewish Congress "to prove the sincerity of their stand" in favor of the embattled Jews of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1933/07/02/2801209/world-jewish-congress-nearerdeutsch-american-delegates-soon-sail-to-confer|author=JTA|title=World Jewish Congress Nearer—Deutsch; American Delegates Soon Sail to Confer, 2 July 1933}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation (1936)===
After two more preparatory conferences in 1933 and 1934, the First Plenary Assembly, held in Geneva in August 1936, established the World Jewish Congress as a permanent and democratic organization. Elections for delegates to that assembly had to be according to democratic principles, namely secret, direct, and based on proportional representation. The 52 American delegates, for instance, were chosen at an Electoral Convention which met in Washington, DC, on 13/14 June 1936 and which was attended by 1,000 representatives from 99 communities in 32 US states.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Jewish Congress's expressed goal was Jewish unity and the strengthening of Jewish political influence in order to assure the survival of the Jewish people, which involved the creation of a Jewish state.&lt;ref name="Garai, pg. 10 and 20"/&gt; 230 delegates representing 32 countries gathered for the first WJC assembly. Addressing a press conference in Geneva, [[Stephen S. Wise]] assailed German Jews for opposing the WJC. He said: "I must make clear that the congress is not a parliament nor an attempt at a parliament. It is nothing more than an assembly of representatives of those Jewries which choose to associate themselves in defense of Jewish rights. The congress will not be wholly representative until all Jews choose to be represented by it."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1936/08/09/2835383/world-jewish-congress-set-to-open-tonight-8-point-program-mapped|title=World Jewish Congress Set to Open Tonight; 8 Point Program Mapped|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nahum Goldmann.jpg|thumb|[[Nahum Goldmann]], co-founder and president of the World Jewish Congress from 1949 to 1977]]
Although the delegates elected the US federal judge and erstwhile president of the American Jewish Congress [[Julian Mack]] as honorary president of the WJC, Wise was appointed as chairman of the WJC Executive and thus ''de facto'' leader of the congress. [[Nahum Goldmann]] was named as chair of the Administrative Committee.&lt;ref name="Garai, pg. 10 and 20"/&gt; The new WJC Executive immediately drew up a declaration asking the British government not to halt immigration into Palestine and presented it to British diplomats in Bern, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1936/08/17/2835437/world-congress-leaders-to-see-british-envoy-on-palestine-today|author=JTA|title=World Congress Leaders to See British Envoy on Palestine Today, 16 August 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC chose Paris as its headquarters and also opened a liaison office to the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva, first headed by the Swiss international lawyer and WJC Legal Advisor [[Paul Guggenheim]] and later by [[Gerhart Riegner]], who initially served as Guggenheim's secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhart Riegner - Never Despair: Sixty Years in the Service of the Jewish People and of Human Rights, published by Ivan R. Dee, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In its fight against growing anti-Semitism in Europe, the WJC pursued a two-pronged approach: the political and legal sphere (mainly the lobbying of the [[League of Nations]] and public statements) on the one hand, and an attempt to organize a boycott of products from countries such as Nazi Germany on the other. Given the weakness of the [[League of Nations]] vis-à-vis Germany and the successful efforts by the Nazi regime to stave off an economic boycott of German products, both approaches proved not very effective.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p.83-110&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the November 1938 pogroms against Jews in Germany called [[Kristallnacht]] in which at least 91 Jews were killed and many synagogues and Jewish shops destroyed, the WJC issued a statement: "Though the Congress deplores the fatal shooting of an official of the German Embassy in Paris by a young Polish Jew of seventeen, it is obliged to protest energetically against the violent attacks in the German press against the whole of Judaism because of this act and, especially, to protest against the reprisals taken against the German Jews after the crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roizen.com/ron/grynszpan.htm|first=Ron|last=Roizen |title=Herschel Grynszpan: the Fate of A Forgotten Assassin, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Vol. 1, No.2., 1986, pp. 217-228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, the WJC headquarters moved from Paris to Geneva to facilitate communications with Jewish communities in Europe. In the summer of 1940, by which time most of Europe had fallen under [[Nazi]] occupation, the World Jewish Congress's headquarters were moved to New York to share office space with the American Jewish Congress, and a special WJC office was set up in London. The British Section of the WJC was tasked with acting as the European representative of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p.122-123&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the personnel who worked in the WJC's European offices immigrated to the United States when the WJC moved its headquarters there. At the New York office in the 1940s, the major departments were: Political Department, Institute of Jewish Affairs (research and legal work), Relief and Rescue, Department for Culture and Education (or Culture Department), and Organization Department. In 1940, the WJC opened a representative office in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&lt;ref name="americanjewisharchives.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2587504540/comit-des-delegations-juives.html|first=Nathan|last=Feinberg|title=Comité des Délégations Juives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WJC efforts during the Holocaust and its aftermath===
The WJC's initial priorities included safeguarding Jewish minority rights, combating anti-Semitism in Europe, and providing emergency relief to Jews fleeing Nazi persecution. The WJC also concentrated on security for Jewish refugees and victims of the war. In 1939, the World Jewish Congress set up a relief committee for Jewish war refugees (RELICO) and cooperated with the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] to protect Jews in Nazi-occupied countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205816.pdf|title=Relief Committee for the Warstricken Jewish Population (RELICO)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nahum Goldmann, Stephen Wise, Henri Torres at World Jewish Congress conference in New York, June 1942.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|left|Left to right: [[Nahum Goldmann]], [[Stephen Wise]], and French lawyer [[Henri Torres|Henry Torrès]] (speaking) at a World Jewish Congress conference in New York City, 7 June 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1942/06/08/2857896/immediate-restoration-of-jewish-rights-in-europe-after-allied-victory-demanded|title=Immediate Restoration of Jewish Rights in Europe After Allied Victory Demanded|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] Under the auspices of the WJC, 18 committees were set up in the United States composed of exiled representatives of the different European Jewish communities under Nazi rule. The committees were modeled on the governments-in-exile, and their task was to provide moral and material support for Jews in the respective countries, and to prepare a program of Jewish postwar demands. All representative committees together formed the Advisory Council on European Jewish Affairs, which came into being at a conference in New York City in June 1942.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 128-129&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC also lobbied Allied governments on behalf of Jewish refugees, and urged US Jewish organizations to work towards waiving immigration quotas for Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution. In 1940, General [[Charles de Gaulle]], the leader of the French government in exile, pledged to the WJC that all measures taken by the [[Vichy regime]] against the Jews would be repudiated upon France's liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1941 and early 1942, Western diplomats and journalists received scattered information about Nazi massacres of many thousands of Jews in German-occupied Poland and Russia. However, the news was difficult to confirm. In June 1942, [[Ignacy Schwarzbart]], one of two Jewish representatives on the Polish National Council of the Polish government-in-exile, held a press conference with WJC officials in London, where it was stated that an estimated one million Jews had already been murdered by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jtnews.net/index.php?/viewpoints/item/9254/C26 |first=Rafael |last=Medoff |title=How America first learned of the Holocaust|date=2012-06-20|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Riegner Telegram====
{{Main|Riegner Telegram}}

On 8 August 1942, the WJC's Geneva representative [[Gerhart Riegner]] sent a telegram to the US vice-consul in Geneva in which he informed the Allies for the first time about the Nazis planned [[Final Solution]] to exterminate all Jews in the German-occupied territories.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/filmmore/reference/primary/newsusdept.html U.S. State Department receives information from Switzerland regarding the Nazi plan to murder the Jews of Europe]: The American Experience&lt;/ref&gt; Riegner had received his information from the German industrialist [[Eduard Schulte]].

His telegram read as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Received alarming report about plan being discussed and considered in ''Führer'' headquarters to exterminate at one fell swoop all Jews in German-controlled countries comprising three and a half to four million after deportation and concentration in the east thus solving Jewish question once and for all stop campaign planned for autumn methods being discussed including hydrocyanic acid stop&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:World Jewish Congress War Emergency Conference Atlantic City 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Louise Waterman Wise]], Jewish activist and wife of WJC President [[Stephen Samuel Wise|Stephen S. Wise]], addressing the World Jewish Congress War Emergency Conference in Atlantic City, November 1944]]
It was only several weeks later, on 28 August 1942, that WJC President [[Stephen S. Wise]] received Riegner's alarming message.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Medoff, [http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/06/11/how-america-first-learned-of-the-holocaust "How America First Learnede of the Holocaust"] The Algemeiner (June 11, 2012). Retrieved June 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Riegner Telegram|telegram]] was met with disbelief despite preexisting evidence for mass executions. The US State Department considered it "a wild rumor, fueled by Jewish anxieties", while the British Foreign Office refused to forward the telegram for the time being and called for the allegations to be investigated first. It was only on 25 November 1942 that the WJC was allowed to release the news to the world.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July 1942, 20,000 people participated in a WJC-organized "Stop Hitler Now" demonstration at New York's Madison Square Garden. Nine months later, on 1 March 1943, an estimated 22,000 people crowded into the same hall and a further 15,000 stood outside at a WJC rally addressed by Wise, [[Chaim Weizmann]], New York Mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/peopleevents/pandeAMEX101.html |title=The American Experience.America and the Holocaust.People &amp; Events &amp;#124; Rabbi Stephen Wise (1874-1949) |publisher=PBS |date=1942-08-28 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the US government did not heed calls to rescue European Jews. Early in 1944, US Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] stated in front of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] that "certain officials in our State Department" had failed while it would have been commanded by duty to "prevent the extermination of the Jews in German-controlled Europe".

====Rescue efforts====
Throughout the war, the WJC lobbied the Allied governments to grant visas to Jewish refugees from Europe and to ensure the restoration of Jewish minority rights in areas liberated by the Allied forces.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the US State Department's opposition, the WJC obtained permission from the [[US Treasury Department]], headed by [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]], to transmit funds to Europe for the rescue and assistance of persecuted Jews. According to a report by Riegner, these funds helped to bring 1,350 Jewish children from the occupied countries to Switzerland and 70 to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at the [[Bermuda Conference|Bermuda Refugee Conference]] in 1943, both the United States and Britain refused to relax their immigration policies, not even for British Mandatory Palestine. In reaction, the WJC published a comment which said: "The truth is that what stands in the way of aid to the Jews in Europe by the United Nations is not that such a program is dangerous, but simple lack of will to go to any trouble on their behalf."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Only in January 1944, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered the setting up of the [[War Refugee Board]], whose purpose was to "rescue victims of enemy oppression who are in imminent danger of death".&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Jewish Congress also tried - mostly in vain - to convince the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) to assert its authority more forcefully vis-à-vis the Germans, and urged it to secure the status of civilian prisoners of war under the [[Third Geneva Convention]] on prisoners of war for those Jews that were confined to ghettos and Nazi concentration camps, which would have entitled the ICRC to provide care to them. However, the ICRC stuck to the view that it was "in no position to bring pressure to bear upon governments", and that the success of its work "depended on discreet and friendly successions."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 168-169&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holocaust era president of WJC, [[Stephen Wise]], opposed the [[Bergson Group]]'s rescue activism.&lt;ref&gt;The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust, 1941-1945 (Pantheon Books, 1984) {{ISBN|978-0-394-42813-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Deafening Silence: American Jewish Leaders and the Holocaust (New York: Shapolsky Publishers, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Later president [[Nachum Goldman]] told the State Department (per department protocol) that [[Hillel Kook]] (aka [[Peter Bergson]]) is an adventurer and does not represent "organized Jewry". He pleaded to either deport or draft Hillel Kook in order to stop his activism&lt;ref&gt;A Race Against Death: Peter Bergson, America, and the Holocaust, with David S. Wyman (The New Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Letter to State Department====
[[File:A. Leon Kubowitzki.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|[[Aryeh Leon Kubowitzki]]]]

On 9 August 1944, Leon Kubowitzki (later Aryeh Leon Kubovy), the head of the WJC's Rescue Department, relayed a message from Ernest Frischer of the Czechoslovak State Council to the US State Department urging the destruction of the gas chambers and the bombing of railways lines leading to the [[Auschwitz]] death camp. US Undersecretary of War John J. McCloy rejected the suggestion five days later, writing to Kubowitzki:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After a study it became apparent that such an operation could be executed only by the diversion of considerable air support essential to the success of our forces now engaged in decisive operations elsewhere and would in any case be of such doubtful efficacy that it would not warrant the use of our resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/filmmore/reference/primary/bombworld.html|title=The World Jewish Congress in New York asks the War Department to bomb the crematoria at Auschwitz, August 9, 1944. The War Department turns down the request (August 14, 1944).|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 1944, at the War Emergency Conference held in [[Atlantic City]], USA, the WJC elaborated a program for the post-war period, which included calls for reparations from Germany to Jews and the use of heirless Jewish property for Jewish rehabilitation. Also at that conference, [[Stephen S. Wise]] was elected president of the World Jewish Congress. Delegates decided to embark on a $10,000,000 fund-raising effort for relief and increased political activity throughout the world. The news agency JTA also reported the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The closing session of the conference also adopted a resolution recommending that the Congress establish a Department of Community Service which would be charged with aiding in the reconstruction of the spiritual and cultural life of Jews in liberated countries. Another resolution extended the gratitude of the gathering to the Vatican and to the Governments of Spain, Sweden and Switzerland for the protection they offered under difficult conditions to the persecuted Jews in German-dominated Europe. At the same time, it expressed regret at the fact that 'deplorably little has been done to have Axis civilians under the power of the United Nations exchanged for Jews in ghettos, internment, concentration and labor camps.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1944/12/03/2865512/world-jewish-congress-10000000-drive-no-challenge-to-other-groups-leaders-say|World Jewish Congress $10,000,000 Drive No Challenge to Other Groups, Leaders Say], Publisher:JTA, Date: 1944-12-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Meeting of WJC representative with SS leader Heinrich Himmler====
In February 1945, the head of the Swedish office of the WJC, Hilel Storch, established contact through an intermediary with SS chief [[Heinrich Himmler]].&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 190-191&lt;/ref&gt; In April, [[Norbert Masur]] of the Swedish Section of the WJC secretly met with Himmler at Harzfeld, around 70 kilometers north of Berlin. Masur had been promised safe conduct by Himmler. Through negotiations with the Nazi leader and the subsequent talks with the head of the Swedish Red Cross, [[Folke Bernadotte]], the WJC was allowed to save 4,500 inmates from the women's concentration camp at Ravensbrück. Approximately half of these women, who had been deported to Germany from over forty countries, were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Fox, [http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje38/text18p.htm 'A Jew Talks to Himmler'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110174719/http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje38/text18p.htm |date=2012-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-war efforts====
At the end of the war, the WJC undertook efforts to rebuild Jewish communities in Europe, pushed for indemnification and reparation claims against Germany, provided assistance to displaced persons and survivors of the Holocaust, and advocated for the punishment of Nazi leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The World Jewish Congress notably took part in the formulation of the principles governing the [[Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal]] and furnished evidence against Nazi leaders to the US prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, pp. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/nuremberg/documents/index.php?documentdate=1945-06-12&amp;documentid=C106-16-5&amp;studycollectionid=&amp;pagenumber=1y|title=Truman Library: Minutes, Meeting of World Jewish Congress with Robert H.

[[File:1948 World Jewish Congress Montreux - 2.jpg|thumb|Stephen Wise addresses World Jewish Congress Plenary Assembly in Montreux, [[Switzerland]], August 1948]]
On 19 August 1945, a conference of representatives of European Jews was organized in Paris, France by the WJC, whose leadership (Wise, Goldmann, Kubowitzki) traveled there from the US. Delegates from Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland attended the gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1945/07/23/2867727/jews-of-western-europe-to-meet-in-paris-delegates-from-seven-countries-expected|title=Jews of Western Europe to Meet in Paris; Delegates from Seven Countries Expected|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 1945, [[Pope Pius XII]] received WJC Secretary General Leon Kubowitzki in audience, who recounted to the pope the "great losses" suffered by the Jews during the war and expressed gratitude for what the church had done to help "our persecuted people." Kubowitzki suggested a papal encyclical on the Catholic Church's attitude toward the Jews and a condemnation of anti-Semitism. "We will consider it," Pius XII reportedly replied, adding: "certainly, most favorably, with all our love." The WJC also urged the Vatican to assist in the recovery of Jewish children saved by Catholics during the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Marrus, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1252/is_1_133/ai_n26741974/pg_2 "The missing: the Holocaust, the Church &amp; Jewish orphans"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC also supported the foundation of the [[United Nations]] Organization in 1945. In 1947, the organization became one of the first NGOs to be granted [[consultative status]] with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about|title=About Us|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, an estimated 30,000 people attended the opening of the Latin American Conference of the World Jewish Congress at [[Luna Park, Buenos Aires]], Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1947/06/30/3010696/80000-at-opening-of-latinamerican-parley-of-world-jewish-congress-in-buenos-aires|title=30,000 at Opening of Latin American Parley of World Jewish Congress in Buenos Aires, JTA, 30 June 1947|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WJC and the creation of the State of Israel===
Although its principal purpose was to defend the rights of Jews in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]], the WJC always actively supported the aims of [[Zionism]], i.e. creation of a [[Jewish National Home]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The [[Yishuv]], the Jewish community in British Mandatory Palestine, was represented at the First Plenary Assembly of the WJC in 1936, which affirmed in a resolution "the determination of the Jewish people to live in peaceful cooperation with their Arab neighbors on the basis of mutual respect for the rights of each."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, in a memorandum to the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]] on Palestine drafted by WJC Political Secretary Alexander L. Easterman, the WJC declared that "the only hope of reviving the life and culture of the Jewish people lies in the establishment of a fully self-governing Jewish Homeland, recognised as such throughout the world; that is, a Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

WJC officials lobbied UN member states in favor of the adoption of [[UN General Assembly]] Resolution 181 of 1947, which called for the creation of a Jewish and an Arab state in Palestine. On 15 May 1948, the day of Israel's proclamation of independence, the WJC Executive pledged "world Jewry's solidarity" with the fledgling Jewish state. In Montreux, Switzerland, delegates from 34 countries attended the Second Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress, held from 27 June to 6 July 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, pp. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiations with Germany on reparations and compensation===
In 1949, the World Jewish Congress called on the newly established [[Federal Republic of Germany]] to acknowledge responsibility and liability of the German people for the wrongs inflicted on the Jewish people by the Nazi regime. In 1950, the WJC opened an office in Frankfurt to function as a "listening post" on developments in Germany. In representations to the United States, Britain and France, the WJC detailed Jewish moral and material claims on Germany. In 1951, [[Nahum Goldmann]], at the request of the Israeli government, established the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany ([[Claims Conference]]).&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, in a declaration approved by the parliament, West German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] recognized Germany's duty to make moral and material restitution to the Jewish people and signaled its readiness to engage in negotiations with Jewish representatives and the State of Israel. "Unspeakable crimes have been committed in the name of the German people, calling for moral and material indemnity [ ... ] The Federal Government are prepared, jointly with representatives of Jewry and the State of Israel [ ... ] to bring about a solution of the material indemnity problem, thus easing the way to the spiritual settlement of infinite suffering," Adenauer said.&lt;ref name="History of the Claims Conference"&gt;[http://www.claimscon.org/?url=history History of the Claims Conference] Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 1952, WJC and Claims Conference head [[Nahum Goldmann]] and the West German federal government signed an agreement embodied in two protocols. Protocol No. 1 called for the enactment of laws that would compensate Nazi victims directly for indemnification and restitution claims arising from Nazi persecution. Under Protocol No. 2, the West German government provided the Claims Conference with 450 million deutschmarks for the relief, rehabilitation and resettlement of Jewish victims of Nazi persecution. Similar agreements were also signed with the [[Israel|State of Israel]].

Subsequent to these agreements, the Claims Conference continued to negotiate with the German government for amendments to the various legislative commitments and monitored the implementation of the various compensation and restitution laws. According to the Claims Conference, more than 278,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors received lifetime pensions under the German Federal Indemnification Laws. Germany expended a total of US$60 billion in satisfaction of Jewish claims.&lt;ref name="History of the Claims Conference"/&gt;

In 1952, the World Jewish Congress called on the Austrian government to intensify efforts for the restitution of heirless Jewish property. Austrian Chancellor [[Leopold Figl]] subsequently pledged to remedy Jewish grievances.&lt;ref name="Garai, p. 34"&gt;Garai, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Third Plenary Assembly in Geneva (4 to 11 August 1953), [[Nahum Goldmann]] was elected president of the World Jewish Congress, having previously served as acting president.&lt;ref name="Garai, p. 34"/&gt;

===WJC efforts on behalf of Soviet Jewry===
Although the [[Soviet Union]] initially supported the creation of the [[State of Israel]], during the 1950s the Jewish state emerged as part of the Western camp, and Zionism raised fears of internal dissent and opposition among the Communist leadership.

During the later part of the Cold War, Soviet Jews were suspected of being traitors, Western sympathizers, or security liabilities. The Communist leadership closed down various Jewish organizations and declared Zionism an ideological enemy. Synagogues were often placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informers. As a result of the persecution, both state-sponsored and unofficial, anti-Semitism became deeply ingrained in the society and remained a fact for years. The Soviet media, when depicting political events, sometimes used the term 'fascism' to characterize Israeli nationalism. Jews often suffered hardships, epitomized by often not being allowed to enlist in universities, work in certain professions, or participate in government. Many Jews felt compelled to hide their identities by changing their names.

[[File:World Jewish Congress - Third Plenary Assembly - Geneva 1953.jpg|thumb|Third Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress, Geneva, Switzerland, 4–11 August 1953]]
In 1953, the World Jewish Congress condemned the indictment in Moscow of Jewish doctors as alleged conspirators against the Soviet Union leadership, the so-called [[Doctors' plot]], and called a leadership meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, which was canceled at the last minute due to the death of Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]]. The new Soviet leadership declared that the case against the doctors had been fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;Garai&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, WJC leaders delivered a memorandum to Soviet leaders [[Nikolai Bulganin]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] during their visit to London, and a year later the World Jewish Congress Executive launched a worldwide call to attention regarding the plight of Jews in the Soviet Union and other Communist countries. This resulted in a growing international campaign for their cultural and religious rights and for the reunion of families separated by the Cold War. After a lapse of seven years, the organization also re-established contact with several Jewish communities in Communist Eastern Europe. In 1957, the Jewish community of Hungary re-affiliated with the WJC.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the WJC convoked the International Conference on Soviet Jewry in Paris, which was chaired by Goldmann. In 1971, the WJC co-sponsored the First World Conference of Jewish Communities on Soviet Jewry in Brussels, Belgium. Successor events were held in Brussels and Zurich in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, pp. 36-52&lt;/ref&gt;

At the second Brussels conference, Jewish leaders called on the Soviet Union to implement the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] on human rights, respect its own constitution and laws and "recognize and respect the right of Jews in the USSR to be united with their brethren in the Land of Israel, the Jewish historic homeland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1976/02/20/2974589/brussels-ii-ends-with-call-on-ussr-to-implement-helsinki-declaration-recognize-rights-of-jews-to-be-reunited-with-brethren-in-israel|title=Brussels II Ends with Call on USSR to Implement Helsinki Declaration, Recognize Rights of Jews to Be, JTA, 20 February 1976|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the motto, 'Let my people go!, the Soviet Jewry movement caught the attention of statesmen and public figures throughout the West, who considered the Soviet Union's policy toward Jews to be in violation of basic human and civil rights such as freedom of immigration, freedom of religion, and the freedom to study one's own language, culture and heritage. "You have no choice but to release Soviet Jewry," US President [[Ronald Reagan]] told Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] during the latter's first state visit to the US in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sovietjewry.org/history.php |title=Soviet Jewry Movement Marks Anniversaries |publisher=Sovietjewry.org |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Edgar Bronfman suggested that "American Jews should abandon their strongest weapon, the Jackson–Vanik amendment, as a sign of goodwill that challenges the Soviets to respond in kind."

After [Mikhail Gorbachev]'s ascension in 1985, Bronfman's New York Times message began to resonate with the public. In early 1985, Bronfman secured an invitation to the Kremlin and on September 8–11, visited Moscow, becoming the first World Jewish Congress President to be formally received in Moscow by Soviet Officials. Carrying a note from Shimon Peres, Bronfman met with Gorbachev, and initiated talks of a Soviet Jewish airlift. It is said that Peres' note called on the Soviet Union to resume diplomatic relations with Israel.

In a Washington Post profile a few months after the September trip, Bronfman laid out what he thought had been accomplished during his September meetings. He said, "There's going to be a buildup of pressure through the business community. The Russians know the Soviet Jewry issue is tied to trade ... My guess is that over a period of time, five to ten years, some of our goals will be achieved." Author Gal Beckerman says in his When They Come For Us We'll Be Gone, "Bronfman had a business man's understanding of the Soviet Jewish issue. It was all a matter of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration."

On 25 March 1987, WJC leaders [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.|Edgar M. Bronfman]], [[Israel Singer]], [[Sol Kanee]] and Elan Steinberg, as well as the head of the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations]], [[Morris B. Abram]], arrived in Moscow to discuss the matter with Soviet government ministers, though officials swiftly denied that the USSR had agreed to an increase in Jewish emigration and had invited an Israeli delegation to visit Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-03/news/mn-2416_1_emigration|title=Moscow Denies Shift on Jews or Israel Policy|first=From Times Wire|last=Services|date=3 April 1987|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the visits by WJC officials to Moscow were widely seen as helpful in securing the exit permits for prominent Jews in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="jewishpost.com"&gt;Gad Nahson, [http://www.jewishpost.com/archives/news/edgar-m-bronfman-the-making-of-a-jew.html EDGAR M. BRONFMAN "THE MAKING OF A JEW"], Jewish Post, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Soviet Jewish organizations were granted permission by the authorities to join the World Jewish Congress,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/04/world/soviet-jews-to-join-world-congress.html "Soviet Jews to Join World Congress"], New York Times, 4 January 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later in Jerusalem, several directly elected delegates from the Soviet Union were officially represented for the first time at a World Jewish Congress Plenary Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1991/05/07/2874728/soviet-jews-fill-empty-chair-at-wjc-assembly-in-jerusalem "Soviet Jews Fill ‘empty Chair’ at Wjc Assembly in Jerusalem"], JTA, 7 May 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Securing the rights of Jews in North Africa and the Middle East===
In the aftermath of World War II and the establishment of the State of Israel, the World Jewish Congress was actively involved in assisting Jews in Arab and other Muslim countries, who had come under increasing pressure. In January 1948, WJC President Stephen Wise, appealed to US Secretary of State George Marshall: "Between 800,000 and a million Jews in the Middle East and North Africa, exclusive of Palestine, are in 'the greatest danger of destruction' at the hands of Muslims being incited to holy war over the Partition of Palestine ... Acts of violence already perpetrated, together with those contemplated, being clearly aimed at the total destruction of the Jews, constitute genocide, which under the resolutions of the General Assembly is a crime against humanity." The United States, however, did not take any follow-up action to investigate these pleadings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/jewref.html|title=Jewish Virtual Library-Jewish Refugees from Arab Countries|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Jewish Congress North African Conference, Algiers, June 1952.jpg|thumb|left|World Jewish Congress conference on the situation of Jews in North Africa, Algiers, 1952]]The WJC also submitted a memorandum on the problem to the UN Economic and Social Council, asking for urgent action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zionism-israel.com/hdoc/Arab_League_Law_Jews.htm|title=Draft Arab League Law Regarding Jews-1947|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorandum in particular mentioned an [[Arab League]] document which planned to strip Jewish citizens of their rights and belongings as part of a calculated plan. However, when the WJC brought the Arab League document before the ECOSOC, its president Charles H. Malik, a representative of Lebanon to the UN, refused to bring it to the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpolicycenter.org/112/the-forgotten-jewish-refugees-from-arab-states|title=Robert Ivker, The Forgotten Jewish Refugees From Arab States, 2008|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, the WJC conducted negotiations with a number of Arab governments, notably in North Africa, and pleaded with them to allow their Jewish populations to leave their native countries. With the advance of Arab nationalism, especially during the 1950s, these efforts were increasingly complicated. In 1954, a WJC delegation visited Morocco, then still under French colonial rule.

The WJC leadership also kept in close touch with the leaders of the Moroccan independence movement, including the exiled sultan of Morocco, Mohammed V, who insisted that an autonomous Morocco would guarantee the freedom and equality of all its citizens, including access of non-Muslims to public administration.&lt;ref&gt;Jews in the new North African states, Report submitted to the Fourth Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress by the directors of the Political and International Affairs Departments, A. L. Easterman and Dr. M.L. Perlzweig, in: World Jewry, 1959, p.12-13 and p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; When Morocco became independent from France in 1956, WJC Political Director Alex Easterman immediately began negotiations with Prime Minister [[Mbarek Bekkay]] and other government officials, pressing them to grant Jews the right to leave.

Whilst in 1957 an agreement was reached to allow for the emigration of all 8,000 Jews from Mazagan that were held in a refugee camp near [[Casablanca]],&lt;ref name="Gerhart M. Riegner 1961, p. 19"&gt;Gerhart M. Riegner, Jews in North Africa, in: World Jewry, 1961, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; a 1959 WJC report concluded that in spite of repeated assurances by the new government that Jewish rights would be safeguarded, "internal political conflicts have obstructed a solution" to the problem that Moroccan Jews willing to leave the country were denied passports by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Jews in the new North African states, Report submitted to the Fourth Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress by the directors of the Political and International Affairs Departments, A. L. Easterman and Dr. M.L.

Riegner 1961, p. 19"/&gt; However, both King [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]] and his successor, [[Hassan II]] of Morocco continued to emphasize that Jews enjoyed equal rights in their country.&lt;ref name="Gerhart M. Riegner 1961, p. 19"/&gt;

===1950s-1980s===
Delegates from 43 countries attended the Fourth WJC Plenary Assembly held in Stockholm in 1959.

In 1960, the WJC convoked a special conference in Brussels following a series of anti-Semitic incidents in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Congress in Action – Chronicle of forty years, in: George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936-1976, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1966, the speaker of the West German parliament, [[Eugen Gerstenmaier]], delivered an address titled, 'Germans and Jews – A Problem Unresolved' to the Fifth Plenary Assembly in Brussels, Belgium, becoming the first senior German politician to address a WJC conference, which caused some controversy within the WJC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19660802&amp;id=cNsjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1ycEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3126,329372|title=Milwaukee Journal, 2 August 1966, p.3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some delegates from Israel boycotted the session with Gerstenmaier in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1966/08/02/3085139/mapam-and-her-ut-to-boycott-wjc-symposium-on-germans-and-jews|title=Mapam and Herut to Boycott WJC Symposium on ‘Germans and Jews’ - JTA, 2 August 1966|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the American Section of the WJC was set up to broaden the organization's constituency in the country with the biggest Jewish community worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Congress in Action – Chronicle of forty years, in: George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936-1976, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] affiliated with the World Jewish Congress. The British Section of the WJC, which had previously represented UK Jewry, was dissolved.

To emphasize its solidarity with the State of Israel, the WJC held its Sixth Plenary Assembly in 1975 for the first time in Jerusalem, and with one exception, all plenary assemblies have since been held there. The delegates also adopted new statutes and a new structure for the organization, and the WJC entered into a cooperation agreement with the [[World Zionist Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Congress in Action – Chronicle of forty years, in: George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936-1976, p. 56-58&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition to UN resolution condemning Zionism as racism====
The World Jewish Congress was vocal in efforts to repeal [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]], which was adopted on November 10, 1975 and held "that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;''Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism'', Gil Troy, Oxford University Press, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-19-992030-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC Executive characterized the resolution as an "attempt to defame Zionism by equating it with imperialism, colonialism, racism, and apartheid, […] amounting to incitement to racism and racial hatred." All communities and organizations affiliated to the Congress were urged to take immediate action to mobilize public opinion against the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Activities of the World Jewish Congress, February 1975-October 1977, Report of the Secretary-General to the General Council of the World Jewish Congress at its meeting in Washington, October 30 – November 3, 1977, Geneva, October 1977, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Israel made revocation of Resolution 3379 a condition of its participation in the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|Madrid Peace Conference]] of 1991. Resolution 3379 was revoked in 1991 by UN General Assembly Resolution 4686.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the WJC also campaigned for an end to the [[Arab boycott of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1975/10/14/2973350/wjc-committee-on-arab-boycott-will-focus-on-international-pacts "WJC Committee on Arab Boycott Will Focus on International Pacts"], JTA, 14 October 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

====Leadership changes====
At the WJC Plenary in 1975, longtime WJC leader [[Nahum Goldmann]] (then 80) stood again for WJC president. Several Israeli delegates, notably from the [[Herut]] movement, but also former Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]], opposed Goldmann's re-election for his criticism of Israel's policies, notably with respect to the peace process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1975/01/08/2970955/herut-seeking-to-prevent-reelection-of-goldmann-as-wjc-president|title=Herut Seeking to Prevent Re-election of Goldmann As WJC President - JTA, 8 January 1975|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1975/02/10/2970825/goldmann-reelected-wjc-president-despite-bitter-herut-opposition|title=Goldmann Re-elected Wjc President Despite Bitter Herut Opposition - JTA, 10 February 1975|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, when Klutznick was named US secretary of commerce by President [[Jimmy Carter]], the Canadian-American businessman [[Edgar Bronfman Sr.]] took over as acting head of the organization. Bronfman was formally elected WJC president by the Seventh Plenary Assembly, held in Jerusalem in January 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/01/world/bronfman-heads-jewish-congress.html?scp=2&amp;sq=edgar+bronfman&amp;st=nyt "Bronfman Heads Jewish Congress"], New York Times, 1 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Edgar M. Bronfman=====
Under the leadership of Bronfman, the new Secretary General [[Israel Singer]] (who took over from [[Gerhart Riegner]] in 1983), and Executive Director Elan Steinberg, the WJC adopted a more aggressive style. Steinberg characterized the change as follows: "For a long time, the World Jewish Congress was meant to be the greatest secret of Jewish life, because the nature of diplomacy after the war was quiet diplomacy. This is a newer, American-style leadership — less timid, more forceful, unashamedly Jewish."&lt;ref name="jewishpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishledger.com/2012/04/elan-steinberg-advocated-for-holocaust-survivors-around-the-world "Elan Steinberg advocated for Holocaust survivors around the world"], Jewish Ledger, 10 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  
Bronfman led the World Jewish Congress in becoming the preeminent Jewish organization, as they broadened the organization's base by bringing in new member communities in Europe. Through campaigns to free Soviet Jewry, the exposure of the Nazi past of Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, and the campaign to compensate victims of the Holocaust, Bronfman became well known internationally in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jewish Philanthropist Edgar Bronfman Passes Away at 84 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Edgar-Bronfman-passes-away-at-84-335767 |accessdate=April 29, 2014|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 1982, WJC President Edgar Bronfman became the first leader ever of a Jewish organization to address the United Nations General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1982/05/24/2993642/wjc-to-be-the-only-jewish-ngo-to-address-un-assemblys-special-session-on-disarmament "WJC to Be the Only Jewish NGO to Address UN Assembly’s Special Session on Disarmament"], JTA, 24 May 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy over Catholic convent's presence at Auschwitz====
In 1985, [[Carmelites|Carmelite nuns]] opened a convent near the site of the former Nazi death camp [[Auschwitz]] I. WJC President Edgar Bronfman called for the removal of the convent. In public statements, other Jewish leaders, including former WJC Secretary General [[Gerhart Riegner]], also called for the removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1986/01/13/3003376/plan-to-build-convent-on-site-of-auschwitz-death-camp-sparks-anger-among-european-jewish-communities|title=Plan to Build Convent on Site of Auschwitz Death Camp Sparks Anger Among European Jewish Communities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the Catholic Church agreed to those requests and said the convent would be removed within two years.

However, the Carmelites stayed put, and a year later erected a large cross from a 1979 mass with the Pope near their site. The World Jewish Congress Executive strongly urged the Vatican to take action against the convent's presence and said [[Pope John Paul II]] should "exercise his authority" to order the prompt removal of convent and cross. The WJC Executive said the pontiff's action was necessary to implement the agreement major European Catholic cardinals, including the cardinal of Kraków, Franciszek Macharski, had signed with Jewish leaders on 22 February 1987 in Geneva. Edgar Bronfman declared: "It is not only a matter of the Auschwitz convent, but the broader implications of historical revisionism in which the uniqueness of the Holocaust and the murder of the Jewish people is being suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1989/05/11/2870284/wjc-urges-pope-to-use-authority-to-remove-convent-from-auschwitz|title=Wjc Urges Pope to Use Authority to Remove Convent from Auschwitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later, the Carmelites were ordered by Rome to move. The WJC praised the Vatican for taking action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1989/09/20/2871143/vatican-praised-for-offer-to-help-relocate-the-convent-at-auschwitz|title=Vatican Praised for Offer to Help Relocate the Convent at Auschwitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the nuns remained on the site until 1993, leaving the large cross behind.

====Diplomatic contacts with Communist countries====

During the mid-1980s, the World Jewish Congress also entered into diplomatic talks with several Central and Eastern European countries, notably Communist East Germany, whose leadership the WJC urged to recognize its obligations to Jewish victims of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/27-5-16.shtml "THE GDR OFFERS "SYMBOLIC" COMPENSATION TO JEWISH VICTIMS OF NAZISM"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095417/http://osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/27-5-16.shtml |date=2016-03-10 }}, Radio Free Europe, 20 October 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1990, GDR Prime Minister [[Hans Modrow]] sent a letter to WJC President Edgar Bronfman in which he recognized on behalf of the East German government the GDR's responsibility for German crimes committed against the Jewish people under the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;Holocauste: L'Est avoue - Libération, 9 February 1990, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, Modrow said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The German Democratic Republic stands unalterably by its duty to do everything against racism, Nazism, anti-Semitism, and hatred among peoples, so that, in the future, war and fascism will never again start from German soil, but only peace and understanding among people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1990_682891/e-germany-agrees-to-pay-reparations-for-crimes-aga.html|title=E. Germany agrees to pay reparations for crimes against Jews, Houston Chronicle, 9 February 1990|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A few weeks later, the first freely elected parliament of the GDR, the ''[[Volkskammer]]'', passed a resolution which recognized the GDR's responsibility for the Holocaust and asked "Jews around the world for forgiveness". The GDR pledged to compensate for material damages to Jews and to safeguard Jewish traditions. The resolution became part of the [[German reunification]] treaty and continues to be part of German law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compass-infodienst.de/Konrad_Weiss__Antisemitismus_und_Israelfeindschaft_in_der_DDR.1452.0.html#referenz_15|title=04.12.2017 - Nr. 1756|website=www.compass-infodienst.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the World Jewish Congress held a meeting of its Executive Committee in Budapest, Hungary, the first WJC gathering in Communist Eastern Europe since the end of World War II. The Hungarian government had accepted that there would to be no restrictions to the attendance of Israeli delegates or the subjects of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/07/world/a-jewish-parley-in-budapest.html "A JEWISH PARLEY IN BUDAPEST"], New York Times, 7 May 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waldheim affair====
In 1986, the World Jewish Congress alleged that Austrian presidential candidate [[Kurt Waldheim]], a former secretary general of the [[United Nations]], had lied about his service as an officer in the mounted corps of the Nazi Party "[[Sturmabteilung]]" (SA), and his time as German ordnance officer in Thessaloniki, Greece, from 1942 to 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/world/files-show-kurt-waldheim-served-under-war-criminal.html?scp=1&amp;sq=waldheim+nazi+world+jewish+congress&amp;st=nyt |title=FILES SHOW KURT WALDHEIM SERVED UNDER WAR CRIMINAL |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date=4 March 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldheim called the allegations "pure lies and malicious acts". In a telex to Bronfman, he said that his past had been "deliberately misinterpreted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/world/waldheim-says-reports-on-past-are-unfounded.html?scp=5&amp;sq=waldheim+nazi+world+jewish+congress&amp;st=nyt |title=WALDHEIM SAYS HIS PAST WAS MISREPRESENTED |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date=6 March 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he admitted that he had known about German reprisals against partisans: "Yes, I knew. I was horrified. But what could I do? I had either to continue to serve or be executed." He said that he had never fired a shot or even seen a partisan. His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had "remained confined to a desk".

Former Austrian Jewish chancellor [[Bruno Kreisky]] called the World Jewish Congress's actions an "extraordinary infamy" adding that in election, Austrians "won't allow the Jews abroad to order us about and tell us who should be our President."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/04/world/around-the-world-ex-chancellor-voices-criticism-of-waldheim.html "EX-CHANCELLOR VOICES CRITICISM OF WALDHEIM"], [[New York Times]], 4 April 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of the ongoing international controversy, the Austrian government decided to appoint an international committee of historians to examine Waldheim's life between 1938 and 1945. Their report found no evidence of any personal involvement of Waldheim in those crimes. At the same time, although he had stated that he was unaware of any crimes taking place, the historians cited evidence that Waldheim must have known about war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Wiesenthal "The Waldheim Case" in ''Contemporary Jewish Writing in Austria'' edited by Dagmar Lorenz. pp 81-95, University of Nebraska press&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his term as president (1986–1992), Waldheim and his wife Elisabeth were officially deemed "[[personae non gratae]]" by the United States. They could visit only Arab countries and the [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2351006420070623?pageNumber=2 "Waldheim, ex-UN leader and Nazi, buried in Austria"] Reuters, 23 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/jun2007/wald-j21.shtml|title=Kurt Waldheim (1918-2007)|first=Dietmar|last=Henning|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, they were put on a watch list of persons banned from entering the United States and remained on the list even after the publication of the International Committee of Historians' report on his military past in the [[Wehrmacht]].

On May 5, 1987, Bronfman spoke to the World Jewish Congress saying Waldheim was "part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine". Waldheim subsequently filed a lawsuit against Bronfman, but dropped the suit shortly after due to a lack of evidence in his favor.

===Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments===
In 1992, the World Jewish Congress established the World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO), an umbrella body of Jewish organizations and including the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]]. Its purpose is to pursue the restitution of Jewish property in Europe, outside Germany (which is dealt with by the [[Claims Conference]]). According to its website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wjro.org.il/Web/AboutUs/Mission/Default.aspx|title=World Jewish Restitution Organization – Our Mission|publisher=|access-date=2012-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610231419/http://wjro.org.il/Web/AboutUs/Mission/Default.aspx|archive-date=2012-06-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the WRJO's mission is to consult and negotiate "with national and local governments to conclude agreements and ensure legislation concerning the restitution of property to the Jewish people", to conduct "research on Jewish property in national and local archives and to establish a central data bank in which information on Jewish communal property will be recorded and assembled, and to allocate "funds for the preservation of Jewish cultural and educational projects in that country. To date, such funds have been establishes in Poland, Romania and Hungary." Current World Jewish Congress President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] is chairman of the WRJO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wjro.org.il/Web/AboutUs/Council/Default.aspx|title=World Jewish Restitution Organization – Council Representatives|publisher=|access-date=2012-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630164329/http://wjro.org.il/Web/AboutUs/Council/Default.aspx|archive-date=2012-06-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Swiss bank settlement====
{{See also|World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks|Bergier Commission}}
In the late 1990s, as President of the WJC, Edgar Bronfman championed the cause of restitution from Switzerland for Holocaust survivors. Bronfman began an initiative that led to the $1.25 billion settlement from Swiss banks, aiming to resolve claims "that the Swiss hoarded bank accounts opened by Jews who were murdered by the Nazis".

In total, the WJC, the [[Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany]], the World Jewish Restitution Organization, and the [[International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims]], founded in 1998, have secured millions of dollars for the victims and survivors of the Holocaust in payments from Germany, [[World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss Banks|Swiss banks]], Insurances and other parties totaling $20 billion.&lt;ref name=buncombe&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=597158 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305083349/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=597158 |date=March 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/838311.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edgar M Bronfman 1989.jpg|thumb|[[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.|Edgar M. Bronfman]]]]
In 1995, the WJC initiated negotiations on behalf of various Jewish organizations with Swiss banks and the government of [[Switzerland]] over so-called dormant [[World War II]]-era bank accounts of [[Holocaust]] victims. The WJC entered a [[class-action lawsuit]] in Brooklyn, NY alleging that Holocaust victims and their families faced improper barriers to accessing WWII-era Swiss bank accounts because of requirements such as death certificates (typically non-existent for Holocaust victims), and that some Swiss banks made deliberate efforts to retain the account balances indefinitely. The claims also included the value of art works purported to have been stolen, "damages" to persons denied admission to Switzerland on the strength of refugee applications, and the value or cost of labor purported to have been performed by persons being maintained at Swiss government expense in displaced-person camps during the Holocaust, along with interest on such claims from the time of loss. The WJC marshaled the support of US government officials including New York Senator Alfonse D'Amato, who held hearings of the Senate Banking Committee on the topic and claimed that "hundreds of millions of dollars" of WWII-era Jewish assets remained in Swiss banks. At the behest of US President [[Bill Clinton]], Undersecretary of Commerce [[Stuart Eizenstat]] testified at these hearings that Swiss banks knowingly purchased looted gold from the Nazis during WWII. Eizenstat was later named special envoy of the US government for Holocaust issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://banking.senate.gov/97_05hrg/051597/witness/eizenst.htm Hearings before the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301040526/http://banking.senate.gov/97_05hrg/051597/witness/eizenst.htm |date=2007-03-01 }}, May 15, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The report relied exclusively on US government archives. It contained no new historical information on Nazi victims' deposits into Swiss banks, and criticized the decisions of US officials who negotiated settlements with Switzerland after the war as being too lenient.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart E. Eizenstat, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, Special Envoy of the Department of State on Property Restitution in Central and Eastern Europe,[http://www.ushmm.org/assets/state/index.html "U.S. and Allied Efforts To Recover and Restore Gold and Other Assets Stolen or Hidden by Germany During World War II"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101094622/http://www.ushmm.org/assets/state/index.html |date=2007-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nazis/etc/cron.html|title=A Chronology of Events Surrounding the Lost Assets of Victims of Nazi Germany|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audits ordered by the Swiss government of dormant accounts between 1962 and 1995 showed a total of US $32 million (in 1995 terms) in unclaimed war-era accounts. However, during the negotiations, the Swiss banks agreed to commission another audit of wartime accounts, headed by former US [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Paul Volcker]]. The Volcker Commission report concluded that the 1999 book value of all dormant accounts possibly belonging to victims of Nazi persecution that were unclaimed, closed by the Nazis or closed by unknown persons was CHF 95 million. Of this total, CHF 24 million were "probably" related to victims of Nazi persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crt-ii.org/ICEP/ICEP_Report_ToC.pdf "Report on Dormant Accounts of Victims of Nazi Persecution in Swiss Banks"], Annex 4; and Part I paragraph 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nazis/etc/cron.html|title="A Chronology of Events Surrounding the Lost Assets of Victims of Nazi Germany"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission recommended that for settlement purposes, the book values should be modified back to 1945 values (by adding back fees paid and subtracting interest) and then be multiplied by 10 to reflect average long-term investment rates in Switzerland.
On 12 August 1998, several major Swiss banks agreed to pay Holocaust survivors and their relatives more than US$1.25 billion over the following three years. As part of the settlement, the plaintiffs agreed to drop a lawsuit against the Government-owned Swiss National Bank in US courts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Nazi gold====
In 1997, a study commissioned by the World Jewish Congress concluded that Nazi Germany had looted at least US $8.5 billion in gold between 1933 and 1945 from Jews and other victims. The study estimated that a third of the gold had come from individuals and private businesses rather than central banks and that over US $2 billion of privately owned gold eventually ended up in Swiss banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/07/world/a-price-tag-of-billions-in-nazi-gold.html|title=A Price Tag Of Billions In Nazi Gold|first=David E.|last=Sanger|date=7 October 1997|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland rejected the WJC accusations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/08/world/world-news-briefs-swiss-reject-finding-of-3-billion-gold-debt.html?scp=10&amp;sq=world+jewish+congress+nazi+gold&amp;st=nyt "Swiss Reject Finding Of $3 Billion Gold Debt"], [[New York Times]], 8 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In response to inquiries from the World Jewish Congress, the US [[Federal Reserve Bank]] admitted in 1997 that personal gold seized by the Nazis was melted into gold bars after the war and then shipped as gold bullion to the central banks of four European countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/7177/u-s-admits-to-melting-gold-of-nazi-victims "U.S. admits to melting gold of Nazi victims"], New York Jewish Week, 5 December 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Sweden also opened an investigation into assertions by the World Jewish Congress that looted Nazi gold from World War II had been deposited in Swedish government bank vaults.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/21/world/sweden-to-investigate-assertions-of-nazi-gold.html?scp=1&amp;sq=world+jewish+congress+nazi+gold&amp;st=nyt "Sweden to Investigate Assertions of Nazi Gold"], [[New York Times]], 21 December 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

====Agreements with other European countries on Holocaust-era property restitution and compensation====
During the 1990s and 2000s, at the behest of the World Jewish Congress a total of 17 European countries established special committees to look into their role during [[World War II]]. Many set up funds to compensate Jewish and other victims of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/video/17/70_25_wjc_anniversary_video WJC anniversary video] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825093042/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/video/17/70_25_wjc_anniversary_video |date=2012-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, French Prime Minister [[Alain Juppé]] created a commission to investigate the seizures of Jewish property by the occupying Nazi forces and the French collaborators during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nazis/etc/cron.html "A Chronology of Events Surrounding the Lost Assets of Victims of Nazi Germany"] PBS Frontline&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000/2001, the World Jewish Congress helped to negotiate a compensation agreement with the German government and industry under which a €5 billion fund was set up to compensate World War II slave and forced laborers, mainly living Central and Eastern Europe, who had hitherto not received any compensation payments for the suffering under Nazi rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,135530,00.html "NS-Zwangsarbeiter: Erste Zahlungen ab Juni"], Spiegel Online, 23 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restitution of looted art====
In 1998, the WJC released a list of 2,000 people who allegedly took part in the Nazis' massive looting of art. It named people from 11 countries, including museum curators, gallery owners, art experts and other intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/1998-11-10/world/9811_10_nazi.art_1_nazi-art-french-museums-jewish-collections?_s=PM:WORLD "France publishes catalogue of looted Nazi art"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919114417/http://articles.cnn.com/1998-11-10/world/9811_10_nazi.art_1_nazi-art-french-museums-jewish-collections?_s=PM:WORLD |date=2010-09-19 }}, [[CNN]], 10 November 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, in Washington DC, delegates from 44 countries agreed to set up a central registry on art looted by the Nazis which could be established on the internet.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/STYLE/arts/03/02/holocaust.art.reut "Manhattan museum plans to issue Holocaust looted-art study"], [[CNN]], 2 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald S. Lauder]], then chairman of the WJC Art Recovery Commission, estimated that 110,000 pieces of art worth between US $10 and 30 billion were still missing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/227675.stm "Europe Nazi loot to return to Holocaust victims"], [[BBC News]], 4 December 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the World Jewish Congress criticized museums for waiting for artworks to be claimed by Holocaust victims instead of publicly announcing that they have suspect items.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"/&gt; In the wake of the WJC accusations, a number of countries commissioned investigations into Nazi-looted art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1060451.stm "Canada probes Nazi loot"], [[BBC News]], 8 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with Poland===
The WJC has evinced a great interest in Poland, both before the war, when the country was home to some 3.25 million Jews (10 percent of that country's total population, forming the largest Jewish community in Europe); and in the post-war period, when the Jewish community was reconstituted. In second half of the 1930s, in the face of a marked rise in antisemitism, the WJC attempted to intervene on behalf of [[Polish Jewry]]. In December 1936, for example, [[Nahum Goldmann]] visited Poland and conferred with the Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Jozef Beck]], but this ''demarche'' did little to abate the situation. In order to counter the drastic affects of the ban on kosher slaughter ([[Shechita]]), the WJC Economic Department prepared a study on the legislation and proposed various relief measures that could be instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Unity in Dispersion, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The WJC also intervened to ensure that Polish Jews deported from Germany at the end of October 1938 and stranded in Zbaszyn would be allowed to resettle elsewhere in Poland.

After the war, when a wave of [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–1946|anti-Jewish violence swept the country]], the WJC prevailed upon the Polish government to remove all obstacles faced by Jews who sought to leave the country and for the most part Jews were able to emigrate unhindered until about 1950. Most left without visas or exit permits thanks to a decree of [[Marian Spychalski|Gen. Spychalski]].&lt;ref name="D-H"&gt;Devorah Hakohen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCw6v0TFhdMC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22Poland+opened+its+gates+to+Jewish+emigration.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vZPlTILoE8uUnAey5NGjDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Poland%20opened%20its%20gates%20to%20Jewish%20emigration.%22&amp;f=false  ''Immigrants in turmoil: mass immigration to Israel and its repercussions...''] Syracuse University Press, 2003 - 325 pages.

VI, Spring 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the Polish government and the WJC worked to have Auschwitz placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list as site of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Klein, The Battle for Auschwitz: Catholic-Jewish Relations Under Strain (London, Vallentine Mitchell, 2001), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The organization repeatedly pressed Poland to ensure that in Auschwitz and other Nazi German death camp sites, the memory of the Jews who had been the main victims, would not be subsumed in collective memory. As such, at the end of the 1980s, the organization was deeply involved in the struggle to have the Carmelite convent that had been established on its ground removed. Rabbi [[David Rosen (rabbi)|David Rosen]] of the Anti-Defamation League noted at the time: "To some extent the WJC did determine the tune. Their style created the atmosphere in which no public Jewish organization could not get involved. Had the WJC not got involved, those issues might not have developed in the way they did."&lt;ref&gt;Emma Klein, The Battle for Auschwitz:P Catholic-Jewish Relations Under Strain (London, Vallentine Mitchell, 2001), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC has consistently lobbied the Polish government to enact legislation that would ensure the restitution of private property seized during the Nazi occupation and later during the Communist regime. In April 1996, during a discussion about the restitution of Jewish communal property that had been seized during the Holocaust, WJC Secretary General [[Israel Singer]], allegedly stated that "More than three million Jews died in Poland, and the Polish people are not going to be the heirs of the Polish Jews. We are never going to allow this. ( ... ) They're gonna hear from us until Poland freezes over again." If Poland did not satisfy Jewish claims it would be "publicly attacked and humiliated" in the international forum, Singer said according to a Reuters report.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish group threatens Poland over restitution, Reuters, 19 April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, President Lauder declared that by prevaricating on the restitution issue Poland was "telling many elderly prewar landowners, including Holocaust survivors, that they have no foreseeable hope of even a small measure of justice for the assets that were seized from them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/27993 |title=EJP &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Jewish leader discusses restitution of stolen property with Polish PM |publisher=Ejpress.org |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pursuit of a more nuanced approach to the history of Polish-Jewish relations that includes Jewish recognition of Polish losses suffered during World War II, the WJC's Research Institute published two monographs which explored the attempts to revive [[Polish Jewry]] and the ways in which Poles and Jews have confronted their common history.&lt;ref&gt;Policy Study No. 14 "Polish Jews: A Postscript to the 'Final Chapter'?" (Jerusalem, 1998) and Policy Study No. 22 "The Struggle for Memory in Poland: Auschwitz, Jedwabne and Beyond" (Jerusalem, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Israel Council on Foreign Relations, which operates under the auspices of the World Jewish Congress, together with the Polish Institute for International Affairs, held two successive conferences (one in Warsaw in 2009 and the other in Jerusalem in 2010) to discuss bilateral relations and international issues of mutual concern. At the second gathering the 20th anniversary of the re-establishment of relations between the two countries was marked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Thoughts-on-May-3.|title=Patrycja Sasnal (editor), "Polish-Israeli Foreign Policy Conference: Twenty Years of Bilateral Relations, Jerusalem, 19-20 September, 2010 - Post Conference Reports" PISM (November 2010); Laurence Weinbaum, Thoughts on May 3 - Jerusalem Post, 2 May 2009. |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key policies and activities of the World Jewish Congress==
===Support for Israel===
[[File:Tony Blair - Jerusalem - June 2011.jpg|thumb|left|International Quartet for the Middle East envoy [[Tony Blair]] briefs delegates at the World Jewish Congress Governing Board in Jerusalem on the peace process, June 2011]]
The mission statement of the World Jewish Congress says that the organization seeks "to enhance solidarity among Jewish communities throughout the world and, recognizing the centrality of the State of Israel to contemporary Jewish identity, to strengthen the bonds of Jewish communities and Jews in the Diaspora with Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/889d69aea1ad8f09311d85d33e42e71ed41ef626.pdf+|title=World Jewish Congress|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fighting the delegitimization of Israel====
The WJC recently started to focus its main activity on countering the [[delegitimization of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cbn.com/jerusalemdateline/archive/2010/09/02/exclusive-ron-lauder-on-the-deligitimization-of-israel.aspx%20|title=VIDEO: Ron Lauder on the 'Delegitimization of Israel', CBN News, 2 September 2010|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413111541/http://blogs.cbn.com/jerusalemdateline/archive/2010/09/02/exclusive-ron-lauder-on-the-deligitimization-of-israel.aspx|archive-date=2011-04-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC lobbies international organizations, notably the United Nations, to ensure that governments "apply the same standards to Israel when judging its actions compared with those of other countries."&lt;ref name="WJC &amp; Supporting Israel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/6|title=WJC &amp; Supporting Israel|accessdate=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122333/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/6|archive-date=2012-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WJC states on its website that "Israel should not be singled out for criticism by countries which do not themselves adhere to the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law" and that "Israel needs to be treated fairly in international organizations, especially in [[United Nations]] bodies such as the [[UN Human Rights Council]]."&lt;ref name="WJC &amp; Supporting Israel"/&gt;

In early 2009, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder wrote to UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, [[Navi Pillay]], ahead of the [[Durban Review Conference]], asking that the clauses stigmatizing Israel in the 2001 Durban Declaration and Program of Action be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/27/idUS145074+27-Mar-2009+PRN20090327%20%20|title=Durban Review Conference: World Jewish Congress Calls for Repeal of 2001 Clauses - WJC Press Release, 27 March 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauder also denounced the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] for issuing what he called a "profoundly unbalanced and biased report" into Israel's raid of the [[Gaza flotilla]] in May 2010. "We note that [the council] has lost its moral compass, where terrorism is deemed activism, and self-defense is called disproportionate violence. If the UNHRC wants to regain the integrity of its original purpose, it cannot submit to being manipulated into justifying and covering up terrorism," the WJC president declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/9595/wjc_condemns_un_human_rights_council_probe_on_flotilla_raid+|title=WJC condemns UN Human Rights Council probe on flotilla raid|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the World Jewish Congress, together with several Israeli government ministries, convened a consultation entitled 'Building Partnerships and Synergies in Countering the Assault on Israel's Legitimacy' in Jerusalem. It was attended by over 100 professional Jewish leaders from 60 different organizations. The conference identified the need for a collaborative effort on behalf of world Jewry and the State of Israel to advance the protection of Israel's rights and "halt the political and economic assault" against it. Israel's Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], the Minister for Strategic Affairs, [[Moshe Yaalon]], [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] Chairman [[Natan Sharansky]], former Canadian Justice Minister and current member of Parliament [[Irwin Cotler]], Italian lawmaker [[Fiamma Nirenstein]] and international Jewish leaders participated in the consultation, which led to the establishment of the 'Global Coalition for Israel' and the formation of task forces to implement the conclusions reached.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/events/showEvent/id/11 Strategic Consultation - "Building Partnerships and Synergies in Countering the Assault on Israel’s Legitimacy" - WJC website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208142425/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/events/showEvent/id/11 |date=2011-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], the WJC in September 2011 published a policy book entitled 'The Rights of Israel as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/news/israel_rights_pdf/Israel_Rights.pdf|title=Israel's Rights as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602123855/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/news/israel_rights_pdf/Israel_Rights.pdf|archive-date=2012-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book features academic articles by international legal and political experts across the political spectrum, including [[Alan Dershowitz]], [[Ruth Lapidoth]], Stanley Urman, [[Shlomo Avineri]], [[Martin Gilbert]], [[Dan Diker]] and others. The authors outline Israel's historical and legal rights, the plight of the Jewish refugees from Arab countries, and refute all the major claims made against Israel by local and international actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/10701/wjc_analysis_israel_s_rights_as_a_nation_state_in_international_diplomacy_|title=WJC ANALYSIS - Israel's rights as a nation-state in international diplomacy|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, United Nations Secretary General [[António Guterres]] became the first UN chief ever to address a World Jewish Congress gathering and also addressed the issue of bias against Israel. Speaking in New York to the delegates of the WJC Plenary Assembly, Guterres promised to stand up against anti-Israel bias at the world organization and said the Jewish state "must be treated like any other member state." He also stressed that Israel had an "undeniable right to exist and to live in peace and security with its neighbors," and that "the modern form of anti-Semitism is the denial of the existence of the State of Israel." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/un-chief-vows-to-stand-up-against-anti-israel-bias-anti-semitism/|title=UN chief vows to stand up against anti-Israel bias, anti-Semitism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Support for peace process and opposition to Palestinian unilateralism====
The World Jewish Congress has endorsed a [[two-state solution]] to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and is opposed to unilateral actions by either side. It states on its website that "a negotiated settlement between Israel and the Palestinians based on a two-state solution is the only legitimate and just way to provide for a lasting peace. The nascent Palestinian state should respect the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. A Palestinian state can only be founded if it respects Israel's right to exist in security. Initiatives that help to enable the Palestinians to advance economically and socially should also be supported as a means of stabilizing the peace process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/6%20|title=Supporting Israel - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520175356/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/6%20|archive-date=2013-05-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the 2011 UN Security Council vote that would have resulted in the success of the Palestinian unilateral bid for statehood, the WJC worked to underscore what it perceived as a dangerous move for Israel, for the sustainability of a future Palestinian state and for peace in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/10709/ronald_s_lauder_on_the_dangers_of_the_palestinian_statehood_motion|title=Ronald S. Lauder on the dangers of the Palestinian statehood motion|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the World Jewish Congress, together with the [[International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians]], assembled in New York to lobby the international community against allowing the Palestinian Authority's unilateral move to become a full member of the United Nations and bypass negotiations with Israel. At a dinner hosted by WJC President Lauder, the delegation of Jewish parliamentarians engaged in an open discussion with UN ambassadors from key countries including Germany, France, Poland and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icjp.net/events/icjp_steering_committee_meetings_in_new_york_and_washington_d_c_7_8_september_2011/5|title=ICJP - Events|website=www.icjp.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronald Lauder, writing in the German newspaper Die Welt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article12470166/Warum-Israel-Mitglied-der-Nato-werden-muss.html|title=Verteidigungsbündnis: Warum Israel Mitglied der Nato werden muss|first=Ronald S.|last=Lauder|date=7 February 2011|publisher=|via=www.welt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; called for Israel to be admitted into the Western alliance [[NATO]]: "Israel needs real guarantees for its security. European NATO member states – including Turkey – must admit the state of Israel into the Western alliance," the WJC president wrote. He referred to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and said they were reminders of how "unpredictable" developments in the Middle East were. Israeli NATO membership "would send a strong signal to other countries not to take on Israel", Lauder argued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/world-jewish-congress/44854/call-israel-join-nato Call for Israel to join NATO - Jewish Chronicle, 8 February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Lauder reacted "with dismay" at a suggestion by Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore to impose a European Union-wide import ban on products made in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Gilmore said were "illegal" and made peace between Israel and the Palestinians "impossible". Lauder said: "Such boycott calls are cynical and hypocritical. Minister Gilmore is taking aim at the only liberal democracy in the Middle East while keeping quiet about those who really wreak havoc in the region: the Assads, Ahmadinejads and their allies Hezbollah and Hamas." He added that "the West Bank territories are legally disputed and not illegally occupied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/11814/world_jewish_congress_dismayed_at_irish_call_for_eu_ban_on_israeli_goods_from_west_bank|title=World Jewish Congress dismayed at Irish call for EU ban on Israeli goods from West Bank|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, on the third anniversary of Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu#June 2009 peace address; "Bar-Ilan Speech"|Benjamin Netanyahu's speech at Bar-Ilan University]], Lauder published a full-page ad in the [[Wall Street Journal]] and other newspapers in which he called on Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] to return to the negotiating table. "Accept the offer to talk, President Abbas. It takes two sides to make peace," Lauder wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4242587,00.html|title=World Jewish Congress urges Abbas to resume talks|date=17 June 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holocaust legacy issues===
The World Jewish Congress continues to focus on Holocaust legacy issues, including the restitution of Jewish assets seized during and after World War II.

====Holocaust remembrance====
Preserving the memory of the [[Shoah]] is a key issue in the WJC's public efforts. In January 2011, WJC President Lauder accompanied German President [[Christian Wulff]] and a number of Holocaust survivors to [[Auschwitz]]. Lauder declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Auschwitz is the largest Jewish cemetery in the world. Auschwitz is where the systematic annihilation of European Jewry was refined and perfected. It is where four gas chambers and four crematoria annihilated more than a million Jews. It is the place where the notorious SS ''Doctor'' Josef Mengele conducted cruel medical experiments on people. It is also the place where thousands upon thousands of Poles, Roma and Sinti and Soviet prisoners of war were brutally murdered alongside the Jewish victims. We owe it to all of them, and to the survivors, to make sure that today's anti-Semites and hatemongers – those who want to destroy the Jewish people and its only refugee, the Jewish nation state Israel – will not get another go at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whjo.info/international-news/82-intl-holocaust-remembrance-day-ronald-lauder-in-auschwitz-for-ceremonies|title=Ronald Lauder in Auschwitz for Ceremonies, 27 January 2011|date=|accessdate=2012-07-02}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On January 28, 2017, WJC President Lauder defended a statement made by President [[Donald Trump]] on the occasion of [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day]] that had generated controversy for failing to mention that the victims of the Holocaust were Jewish. In response to [[Anti-Defamation League]] director [[Jonathan Greenblatt]]'s criticism of the statement, Lauder dismissed concern for remembering the Jewish identities of the victims of the Holocaust as "manufactured controversies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/lauder-criticizes-adls-negative-reaction-to-trump-statement-on-holocaust-remembrance-day-1-6-2017|title=Lauder criticizes ADL reaction to Trump statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day, 28 January 2017|date=|accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restitution of Jewish assets====
Since the end of World War II, the WJC has pressed governments and private enterprises to return seized or looted Jewish assets to their rightful owners. It was instrumental in concluding agreements with a number of European countries.

''See above:'' [[World Jewish Congress#Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments|Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments]]

In its policy guidelines the WJC states that negotiations on Holocaust-era assets are "conducted in the framework of the World Jewish Restitution Organization in coordination with the Israeli government and with the support of the US government and the European Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/holocaust.html|title=WJC and the Holocaust|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization emphasizes that "the distribution of any compensation monies should not be handled by the WJC. The WJC does not seek any form of commission or gratification payments from Holocaust-era compensation or restitution agreements." WJC leaders have in particular urged the Polish government to come up with a restitution law for looted private properties, but Warsaw in March 2011 announced that this was impossible due to the current economic situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4042812,00.html
| title = Poland slammed for halting restitution plans - YNet|date=2011-03-16|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fighting Holocaust denial, revisionism and glorification of the Nazis====
On repeated occasions, the WJC has urged countries to ensure that Holocaust denial is publicly condemned and fought. WJC officials have been critical of a rise of marches in a number of European countries including Hungary and Serbia by WWII Nazi veterans, far-right extremists and neo-Nazis who publicly glorify the Hitler regime and espouse anti-Semitic ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/20367|title=Serbian police ban neo-Nazi group planned rally - European Jewish Press|date=2007-09-27|accessdate=2012-07-02|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130112200558/http://www.ejpress.org/article/20367|archive-date=2013-01-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2007/12/03/world-jewish-congress-asks-pm-to-rein-in-the-far-right/|title=World Jewish Congress asks PM to rein in the far right - Budapest Times|date=2007-12-03|accessdate=2012-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602154248/http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2007/12/03/world-jewish-congress-asks-pm-to-rein-in-the-far-right/|archive-date=2013-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bernie Ecclestone 2012 Bahrain.jpg|thumb|[[Bernie Ecclestone]]]]
In July 2009, [[Bernie Ecclestone]] faced calls from WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] to resign as [[Formula One]] chief after he had praised [[Adolf Hitler]] in a newspaper interview and said that Hitler "got things done." Lauder said someone with Ecclestone's views should not be allowed to run such an important and popular racing series. He urged Formula One teams, drivers and host countries to suspend their cooperation with him. In reaction, Ecclestone told the news agency Associated Press that "I think the people who are saying that haven't got the power to say these things." Asked if the WJC was influential, Ecclestone said: "It's a pity they didn't sort the banks out" and "They have a lot of influence everywhere." After a public outcry, Ecclestone apologized for his remarks and said he had "been an idiot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nascar/story/11923197|title=F1 boss Ecclestone faces criticism over Hitler comments - CBSSports.com|date=2009-07-04|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/sports/jews-call-on-bernie-ecclestone-to-resign-over-hitler-remarks_100214406.html|title=Jews call on Bernie Ecclestone to resign over Hitler remarks - ThaiIndian.com|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/racing/f1/news/story?id=4308574 |title=Ecclestone: Outrage 'probably my fault' - Associated Press|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC also criticized the US internet retailer Amazon.com for selling 'I love Hitler' T-shirts and similar merchandise praising senior Nazi officials. The items were later removed from the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetretailer.com/2008/04/25/amazon-removes-i-love-hitler-t-shirts-following-protests |title=Amazon removes `I love Hitler` T-shirts following protests - Internet Retailer|date=2008-04-25|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the WJC attacked the German Federal Constitutional Court for a ruling which acquitted a Holocaust denier. WJC Vice-President [[Charlotte Knobloch]] called the verdict "quirky" and said that it cast a damning light on the legal proceedings. She accused the highest German court of disposing of Germany's law that makes the denial of the Shoah a crime "through the backdoor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jspace.com/news/articles/german-courts-find-holocaust-deniers-innocent-in-two-cases/7675|title=German Courts Find Holocaust Deniers Innocent in Two Cases - JSpace, 23 February 2012|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206042227/http://www.jspace.com/news/articles/german-courts-find-holocaust-deniers-innocent-in-two-cases/7675|archive-date=2013-12-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an interview with Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] on German public television in which he repeatedly called Israel "an artificial state" that had been built on the "lie of the Holocaust", Knobloch called on the German government to publicly condemn the Iranian leader's statements and to isolate Iran diplomatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/11506/following_ahmadinejad_s_latest_holocaust_denial_wjc_urges_germany_to_scale_back_iran_relations|title=Following Ahmadinejad's latest Holocaust denial, WJC urges Germany to scale back Iran relations|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standing alone amongst all major Jewish organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/361599/on-holocaust-statement-trump-ally-ron-lauder-stands-alone/|title=On Holocaust Statement, Trump Ally Ron Lauder Stands Alone|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder backed Donald Trump's decision to omit any mention of Jews in his 2017 Holocaust commemoration statement. Lauder contended that other Jewish groups were "play[ing] politics" and engaging in "manufactured outrages" that distracted from "real" instances of anti-Semitic threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/lauder-criticizes-adls-negative-reaction-to-trump-statement-on-holocaust-remembrance-day-1-6-2017|title=Lauder criticizes ADL reaction to Trump statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WJC also publicly backed [[David M.

====Prosecution of Nazi war criminals====
The World Jewish Congress has repeatedly called for the prosecution of presumed Nazi war criminals. WJC President Ronald S. Lauder said in 2011: "There must never be impunity or closure for those who were involved in mass murder and genocide, irrespective of their age". The WJC would persist in its efforts to bring the "few old men out there who have the blood of innocent Shoah victims on their hands" before courts of law, to be tried and held accountable for their actions.&lt;ref name="worldjewishcongress.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/10240/ronald_lauder_hails_demjanjuk_conviction_by_german_court|title=Ronald Lauder hails Demjanjuk conviction by German court - WJC website|date=2011-05-12|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, WJC officials called for the extradition Ukrainian-born [[John Demjanjuk]] from the United States to Germany, where he was wanted on charges of aiding to kill at least 27,900 Jews at the Sobibor death camp during World War II. Demjanjuk's trial and conviction by a Munich court in May 2011 was hailed by the organization. It declared: "Belatedly, justice has now been done, and the family members of those who were brutally murdered in Sobibor will certainly welcome this verdict."&lt;ref name="worldjewishcongress.org"/&gt;

In December 2010, Lauder publicly urged Serbia to extradite [[Peter Egner]] to the United States where he was wanted to stand trial for serving in a Nazi unit during World War II that murdered 17,000 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.680news.com/news/world/article/159963--world-jewish-congress-urges-us-to-extradite-alleged-world-war-ii-nazi-to-serbia-for-trial|title=World Jewish Congress urges US to extradite alleged World War II Nazi to Serbia for trial - Associated Press|date=2010-12-21|accessdate=2012-07-02}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Egner died in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2011/01/31/17101636.html|title=(no title)|website=Toronto Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighting anti-Semitism===
[[File:WJC meeting with Argentine President Cristina Kirchner.jpg|thumb|[[Eduardo Elsztain]] and [[Ronald S. Lauder]] with Argentine President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] in Buenos Aires, June 2008]]One of the principal activities of the World Jewish Congress has been to fight [[anti-Semitism]] in all its forms. Its stated policy on this issue is: "Governments and international organizations need to provide adequate resources for the fight against hatred, notably by providing security to Jewish communities and by improving education. Laws against anti-Semitism and other forms of racism need to be adopted and enforced properly in every country. All forms and expressions of [[neo-Nazism]], xenophobia and intolerance are unacceptable and have to be condemned, and the full force of the law needs to be applied to those who are a danger to democracy liberty and Jewish communities. Marches by extremist, anti-Semitic groups should be banned where national laws provide for such a possibility. Governments and political leaders should condemn such events and work together with local Jewish communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/1|title=WJC &amp; Combating Anti-Semitism|accessdate=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602120831/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/1|archive-date=2012-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an opinion article entitled "Sweden's Shame", WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] attacked the Swedish government, church officials and media for "fanning the flames" of hatred against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sweden-s-shame|title=Sweden's Shame by Ronald S. Lauder - Project Syndicate|first=Ronald S.|last=Lauder|date=12 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Lauder condemned as "despicable" remarks made by the Norwegian sociologist [[Johan Galtung]] who had "revived anti-Semitic canards such as Jewish control of the media" and suggested that Israel's Mossad could have been behind the 2011 "massacres in Norway committed by Anders Breivik" in which 77 people died. Lauder declared: "There is a growing tendency to blame the Jews for all evil that happens under the sun. It is a scandal that a leading academics such as Galtung does not shy away from citing notorious forgeries such as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to support his bigoted arguments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eju.org/news/world/ronald-lauder-condemns-norwegian-scholar-anti-semitic-statements |title=Ronald Lauder condemns Norwegian scholar anti-Semitic statements - EJU News, 3 May 2012 |access-date=2012-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518075946/http://www.eju.org/news/world/ronald-lauder-condemns-norwegian-scholar-anti-semitic-statements |archive-date=2012-05-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the WJC president criticized Austrian politicians for failing to publicly denounce the leader of the third-largest political party in the country, the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, who had posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his [[Facebook]] page. "Clearly, and not for the first time, the FPÖ leader is trying to whip up anti-Semitic sentiment. His repeated denials are not credible because his words and actions speak for themselves," Ronald Lauder said in a statement, adding: "This scandal shows that anti-Jewish resentment is still widespread, and unscrupulous politicians are allowed to exploit it for electioneering purposes. That is mind-boggling, and it could have negative repercussions for Austrian Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/bre87m0nl-us-austria-rightists-antisemitism/|title=Austrian rightist chief accused of anti-Semitism over cartoon - Reuters, 23 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] was chosen as a location for the 14th Plenary Assembly because of concerns over the rise of anti-Semitism in that country. Péter Feldmájer, president of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Hungary, stated this was "a symbol of solidarity with our Jewish community, which has been faced with growing anti-Semitism in recent years".&lt;ref name=Budapest1 /&gt; In his speech at the opening dinner, in the presence of Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]], WJC President Ronald S. Lauder lambasted a series of recent anti-Semitic and racist incidents in Hungary. He particularly mentioned Zsolt Bayer, who had penned a newspaper column referring to Roma as "cowardly, repulsive, noxious animals" that are "unfit to live among people" and "shouldn't be allowed to exist." Lauder said "such words are reminiscent of the darkest era in European history" and concluded that "Hungary's international reputation has suffered in recent years" not because it was being "smeared by the foreign press" but rather due to extremists in the Jobbik party. "Jobbik is dragging the good name of Hungary through the mud," Lauder said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/prime-minister-viktor-orban-downplays-rising-anti-semitism-in-hungary-a-898319.html|title=Missing the Point: Hungarian Leader Whitewashes Anti-Semitism|first=James|last=Kirchick|date=6 May 2013|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the WJC assembly in Budapest, about 700 Jobbik supporters held a demonstration in downtown Budapest where they railed against "Zionists" who had "subjugated" the "indigenous people" of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22413301|title=Anti-Jewish rally in Hungary capital|date=4 May 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech to WJC delegates, Orbán condemned the rise in anti-Semitism in Hungary and in Europe more widely. He called it a danger that "threatens even us Christians" and voiced determination to stamp it out. The WJC said in reaction that Orbán had not confronted the true nature of the problem. "We regret that Mr. Orbán did not address any recent anti-Semitic or racist incidents in the country, nor did he provide sufficient reassurance that a clear line has been drawn between his government and the far-right fringe," a WJC spokesman said afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/176038/hungary-premier-viktor-orban-fails-to-take-on-far/?p=all|title=Hungary Premier Viktor Orban Fails To Take on Far Right in Speech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hatred on the internet====
The World Jewish Congress has also urged internet companies, including social media giants such as Google, to act against Holocaust denial, hate speech and anti-Jewish incitement on their platforms. A survey published by the WJC in 2017 revealed that "More than 382,000 anti-Semitic posts were uploaded to social media in 2016, an average of one post every 83 seconds",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/fast-forward/367015/study-anti-semitic-content-posted-on-social-media-every-83-seconds/|title=Anti-Semitic Content Posted On Social Media Every 83 Seconds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which WJC CEO [[R. Robert Singer]] said revealed "how alarming the situation really is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/an-anti-semitic-post-is-uploaded-to-social-media-every-83-seconds-wjc-research-finds-3-5-2017|title=An anti-Semitic post is uploaded to social media every 83 seconds, WJC research finds|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the organization had urged the German branch of [[YouTube]] of tolerating clips of neo-Nazi rock bands on its platform that were illegal in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/world-jewish-congress-slams-youtube-over-neo-nazi-153503664.html|title=World Jewish Congress slams YouTube over neo-Nazi videos|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an opinion piece for the [[Los Angeles Times]], Singer also accused the internet retailer [[Amazon.com]] of offering books that glorify the Holocaust. The WJC CEO wrote that Amazon customers "can buy a plethora of Holocaust-denying literature, swastika pendants and other Nazi memorabilia. While books are clearly different from doormats or flags, they still violate Amazon's guidelines, not to mention common decency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-singer-amazon-antisemitism-holocaust-denial-20170302-story.html|title=Why is Amazon selling Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism?|date=2 March 2017|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialogue with other religions===
The WJC believes that the three Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) can cooperate "to respond to the challenges posed by developments in modern society, especially to discuss and promote shared values."&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/4|title=WJC &amp; Promoting Inter-Faith Dialogue|accessdate=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607094601/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/4|archive-date=2012-06-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jewish-Christian dialogue====
Inter-religious dialogue between Jews and Christians started in the 1940s, notably with the establishment of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]] in Switzerland in 1947. The WJC has managed to establish good relations with the Catholic Church, especially since the [[Second Vatican Council]] and the Declaration ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' in 1965. Progress, however, is slow with regard to the Orthodox and Protestant Churches, which according to the WJC is mainly due to the decentralized nature of these churches and certain political issues related to the Middle East conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/4|title=WJC &amp; Promoting Inter-Faith Dialogue - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607094601/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/4|archive-date=2012-06-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1945, WJC leaders have been received by Catholic pontiffs a number of times. [[Pope Pius XII]] received WJC Secretary General A. Leon Kubowitzki in private audience in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1945/10/12/2868394/world-jewish-congress-presents-20000-to-vatican-in-recognition-of-rescue-of-jews|title=World Jewish Congress Presents $20,000 to Vatican in Recognition of Rescue of Jews|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Paul VI]] met WJC President [[Nahum Goldmann]] in 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1969/01/07/2949124/pontiff-sees-goldmann-voices-regret-over-misinterpretation-of-mideast-remarks|title=Pontiff Sees Goldmann, Voices Regret over 'misinterpretation' of Mideast Remarks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and WJC Secretary General [[Gerhart Riegner]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1975/01/13/2971001/pope-restates-churchs-rejection-of-every-form-of-antisemitism|title=Pope Restates Church’s Rejection of ‘every Form of Anti-semitism’ - JTA, 13 January 1975|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[Philip Klutznick]] met with [[Pope John Paul II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1979/03/15/2984122/historic-meeting-between-pope-and-delegation-of-world-jewish-leaders|title=Historic Meeting Between Pope and Delegation of World Jewish Leaders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Klutznick's successor [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.]] was received by John Paul II in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1992/11/13/2877772/pope-condemns-antisemitism-in-meeting-with-wjc-leader|title=Pope Condemns Anti-semitism in Meeting with WJC Leader - JTA, 13 November 1992|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/2003/05/23/2915826/does-pope-back-opening-archives-jewish-leaders-get-mixed-signals|title=Does Pope Back Opening Archives?

On his election as new Catholic pontiff, [[Ronald Lauder]] called Cardinal [[Jorge Mario Bergoglio]] "an experienced man, someone who is known for his open-mindedness ... a man of dialogue, a man who is able to build bridges with other faiths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=7959|title=World Jewish Congress head praises Pope Francis – Israel Hayom|website=www.israelhayom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was instrumental in the creation inter-faith bodies such as the International Jewish Committee of Inter-religious Consultations (IJCIC), and it has actively participated in the [[International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee]] (ILC). The WJC also contributed to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the State of Israel and the Holy See in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1993/11/18/2879808/vatican-israel-near-accord-on-diplomatic-relations|title=Vatican, Israel Near Accord on Diplomatic Relations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, the WJC persuaded Pope John II to come out in favor of the removal of a convent of Carmelite nuns which had opened near the site of the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz.

The role of the Vatican during the Holocaust remains a controversial issue and has repeatedly flared up. The [[beatification]] and possible [[canonization]] of [[Pope Pius XII]] was criticized by WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]], who said that all Vatican archives on the period should be made accessible to scholars. "There are strong concerns about [[Pope Pius XII]]'s political role during World War II which should not be ignored," Lauder declared in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clericalwhispers.blogspot.be/2009/12/wjc-chides-vatican-on-pius-xii.html|title=WJC chides Vatican on Pius XII|website=clericalwhispers.blogspot.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Lauder and the WJC were highly critical of the Vatican's decision to revoke the excommunication of [[Bishop Richard Williamson]], a senior member of the dissident Catholic group [[Society of St. Pius X]]. Williamson, in an interview with Swedish television, had denied the existence of gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps. Lauder said: "The Vatican was badly advised to revoke the excommunication of the four bishops ... Therefore, we call on Pope Benedict XVI to urgently address these concerns and to ensure that the achievements of four decades of Catholic-Jewish dialogue are not being damaged by a small minority of people who want to divide rather than unite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3667289,00.html|title=YNetNews: WJC head: Holocaust denial must be censured|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauder later praised Benedict XVI for writing a personal letter to Catholic bishops in which the Pope explained himself. "The Pope has found clear and unequivocal words regarding Bishop Williamson's Holocaust denial, and he deserves praise for admitting that mistakes were made within the Vatican in the handling of this affair," the WJC president was quoted as saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=12347|title=World Jewish Congress President praises Pope - Catholic News, 13 March 2009|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717125915/http://cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=12347|archive-date=2012-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Ronald S. Lauder]] was also critical of the continued use of the [[Good Friday Prayer for the Jews]] in church liturgy. In an op-ed for the Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', the WJC president wrote: "When the Pope allows the use of the Good Friday Prayer of the old Tridentine liturgy, which calls for Jews to acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Savior of all men, some of us are deeply hurt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/8806/op_ed_ronald_lauder_calls_on_pope_benedict_xvi_to_clarify_vatican_s_stance_on_pius_xii|title=Op-Ed: Ronald Lauder calls on Pope Benedict XVI to clarify Vatican's stance on Pius XII|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dialogue with Islam====
[[File:Interreligious-Meeting - Mustafa Ceric - Herman Van-Rompuy-Marc-Schneier - Abdujalil Sajid - Brussels 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Bosnia's Grand Mufti [[Mustafa Ceric]], European Council President [[Herman Van Rompuy]], WJC Vice-President Rabbi [[Marc Schneier]], and British Imam Abdujalil Sajid in Brussels, December 2010]]

The World Jewish Congress considers dialogue with representatives of moderate [[Islam]] as "one of the most important and challenging issues at this time. The increasing gap of understanding between so-called Western liberal democracies and the Islamic world is extremely dangerous," according to the WJC website.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

In 2008, WJC leaders met with King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] at an inter-faith conference in the Spanish capital Madrid. Later that year, WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] also called on the Saudi monarch in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/main/showNews/id/8419?print=true|title=WJC leaders meet with Saudi king in New York|accessdate=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520210723/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/main/showNews/id/8419?print=true|archive-date=2013-05-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, WJC Vice-President [[Marc Schneier]] was received by King Hamad of Bahrain at the royal palace in Manama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/11100/wjc_vice_president_schneier_deeply_honored_to_be_first_rabbi_hosted_by_king_hamad_of_bahrain|title=WJC Vice President Schneier 'deeply honored' to be first rabbi hosted by King Hamad of Bahrain|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Jewish Congress also co-hosted a gathering of European Muslim and Jewish leaders in Brussels in December 2010, which included meetings with senior European Union officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3996576,00.html|title=UK Imam prays for Carmel Fire victims|date=9 December 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that occasion, WJC Vice-President Marc Schneier declared: "We have hopefully kick-started a movement that will spread across Europe. The recipe really is quite simple: our two communities must focus more on what unites us than what separates us. We also must restrain the radicals within our own ranks and make sure they don't gain the upper hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/47697|title=Brussels gathering calls for closer cooperation between Muslims and Jews in Europe - European Jewish Press, 6 December 2010|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-05|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112173423/www.ejpress.org/article/47697|archive-date=2013-01-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in London in 2010, Schneier praised leaders of the [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo, considered the oldest center of Islamic scholarship in the world, for opening up inter-religious dialogue to the Jews. He declared: "This is a landmark decision, and Al-Azhar deserves praise for it. Coming from the leading center of Islamic thinking in the world, it will be enormously helpful for all moderate forces within Islam. [ ... ] Leaders from both sides should now seize the opportunity and take Jewish-Muslim relations to the next level. Both communities have a lot more in common, and to give to the other side, than many people think."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=42714|title=.:Middle East Online::Al-Azhar invites Jews to inter-faith talks :.|website=www.middle-east-online.com|access-date=2012-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206142712/http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=42714|archive-date=2017-12-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralistic Israel===
In August 2018, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder called on "Israel's government to listen to the voices of protest and outrage" and uphold the country's democratic and egalitarian principles against the threat of dominance by restrictive Orthodox influence, from what he called 'a radical minority'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/opinion/israel-ronald-lauder-nation-state-law.html Israel, This Is Not Who We Are], [[New York Times]], opinion by WJC President Ronald S.

===Opposing Iran===
Since the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution in 1979]], and in particular following the terrorist attacks [[1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires|against the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in February 1992]] and the [[1994 AMIA bombing|AMIA Jewish center in Buenos Aires in July 1994]], in which over 100 people were killed and which Iran's leadership was accused of having masterminded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1995/01/04/2882946/six-months-after-bombing-argentina-recalls-ambassador|title=Six Months After Bombing, Argentina Recalls Ambassador|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the World Jewish Congress has been vocal in denouncing what it calls the "Iranian threat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/5|title=WJC &amp; the Iranian Threat - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624065358/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/5|archive-date=2012-06-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, then WJC President [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.]] was reportedly instrumental in blocking a planned deal by the [[DuPont]]-owned US oil firm [[Conoco]] with Iran. Bronfman was a member of the DuPont board of directors. The deal would have been the first major investment by an oil company in Iran since 1979, when the United States broke off trade with the country after the seizure of the US Embassy in Teheran by Islamic militants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-15/business/fi-43080_1_clinton-administration-officials Clinton Kills Pending Iran-Conoco Oil Deal : Policy: Order will bar development in Mideast nation and reassert hard-line stance taken since '79 hostage crisis - ''Los Angeles Times'', 15 March 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, the WJC publicly welcomed a decision by US President [[Bill Clinton]] to impose a trade embargo on Iran. "We applaud President Clinton's decisive blow against terrorism," declared WJC Executive Director Elan Steinberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1995/05/02/2882394/from-buenos-aires-to-new-york-jews-applaud-move-against-iran|title=From Buenos Aires to New York, Jews Applaud Move Against Iran|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, after prosecutors in Argentina asked a judge to order the arrest of a former Iranian President [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and other members of his government in connection with the [[1994 AMIA bombing|AMIA bombing]], Bronfman said that "Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism", adding that "the entire international community has a moral responsibility to ensure that Iran is held accountable for its terrorist actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/8300/edgar_m_bronfman_iran_is_a_sponsor_of_terrorism_|title=Edgar M.

The WJC lobbied for the issuing of [[Interpol notice|Red Notices]] by [[Interpol]] against the Iranian suspects in the bombing case, which were approved by the Interpol General Assembly in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/world-jewish-congress-says-interpol-has-proven-the-646645.html?cat=17|title=Yahoo|website=Yahoo|access-date=2012-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207202921/http://voices.yahoo.com/world-jewish-congress-says-interpol-has-proven-the-646645.html?cat=17|archive-date=2013-12-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 18th anniversary of the AMIA bombing in July 2012, WJC President Lauder declared: "The Iranian regime has blood on its hands, not only by suppressing dissent at home but also by sponsoring terrorism world-wide. What the world saw 18 years ago in Buenos Aires it can still see today, be it in Syria, in Lebanon or in other places."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/70170/iran-has-blood-its-hands-over-1994-argentina-blast Iran has 'blood on its hands' over 1994 Argentina blast – ''Jewish Chronicle'', 17 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 resolution on Iran, the WJC expressed support for international condemnation of current Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s repeated calls for the abolition of the State of Israel and his statements questioning the Holocaust. The organization resolved "to make the four-fold threat (the nuclear threat; the threat of genocidal incitement; international state sponsored terrorism; and the systematic and widespread violations of the human and civil rights of the Iranian people) that the current Iranian regime poses to international peace and stability, a high strategic priority of the WJC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/fd1f7613f1eb2952cd96fba32ecc307cd45d672b.pdf+|title=World Jewish Congress|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the WJC launched the ''Iran Update'', "a comprehensive weekly publication disseminated via the internet to most members of the US Congress and government, United Nations missions, foreign diplomats, European Union officials, and Israeli policymakers, in addition to Jewish communities worldwide." The publication focused on exposing Iran's ongoing pursuit of a nuclear capability, domestic Iranian politics, Iranian foreign policy in the Middle East and internationally, Israeli policy vis-à-vis Iran and the efforts of worldwide Jewish communities in combating Iranian Holocaust-denial and nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/d1eede45968612158044b79bf6a95e1c5fc2a85b.pdf+|title=World Jewish Congress|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the WJC's and other international organizations' calls, representatives of many Western countries either did not show up or walked out of the conference chamber when Iranian President Ahmadinejad attacked Israel in his speech to the Durban Review Conference in Geneva in April 2009 and to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] meeting in New York in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/wjc-world-must-boycott-ahmadinejad-speech-at-un-1.7905|title=WJC: World Must Boycott Ahmadinejad Speech at UN|first=Shlomo|last=Shamir|date=14 September 2009|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/iran|title=UN Chamber Mostly Empty for Ahmadinejad Speech - WJC website, September 2009|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724082049/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/iran|archive-date=2012-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The WJC has repeatedly run campaigns accusing Iran of deceiving the international community and calling Ahmadinejad "the world's foremost hatemonger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/9013/stoppt_irans_diktator_+|title=Stoppt Irans Diktator!|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] criticized a visit by Swiss Foreign Minister [[Micheline Calmy-Rey]] to Tehran, where she met with Ahmadinejad mainly to help a Swiss company secure a multibillion-dollar contract to buy natural gas from Iran. Lauder told a press conference in Bern: "Maybe that money that Switzerland is paying to Iran will some day be used to either buy weapons to kill Israelis, or buy weapons to kill Americans, or buy missiles to be able to deliver nuclear weapons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-04-29-3972860867_x.htm+|title=Latest World &amp; National News &amp; Headlines - USATODAY.com|website=www.usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauder also led diplomatic efforts to persuade European businesses to withdraw from Iran. In January 2010, he warmly welcomed the announcement by [[Siemens]] CEO [[Peter Löscher]] that his company would not seek new business in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2010/01/27/siemens_to_stop_doing_business_in_iran/|title=Siemens to stop doing business in Iran|first=George|last=Frey|date=27 January 2010|publisher=|via=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC has repeatedly urged the international community to do more to bring to justice the masterminds of the terrorist attacks against Israel's embassy and AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in the 1990s, which Argentinean prosecutors have said were carried out at the instigation of senior Iranian officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/56827|title=20 years after Buenos Aires bombing attack, World Jewish Congress urges to do more to root out Iran-sponsored international terror - European Jewish Press, 16 March 2012|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112153852/www.ejpress.org/article/56827|archive-date=2013-01-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Olympic news outlet ''Around the Rings''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=37563 |title=Calls to Ban Iran from Olympics; Olympic Obituaries |publisher=Aroundtherings.com |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that World Jewish Congress president [[Ronald S. Lauder]] had issued a statement urging IOC officials to ban Iran from participating in the Olympic Games, citing Iranian athletes' refusal to compete against Israeli athletes. "It is high time that a strong signal is sent to Iran that unless this long-standing boycott is lifted, Iranian athletes will not be allowed to enter major international events such as next year's Olympic Games in London", Lauder said. The WJC reiterated its position when in May 2012 Iranian President Ahmadinejad announced plans to attend the London Olympics.  Ahmadinejad has "no business" attending the London Olympic Games this summer, the ''Jewish Chronicle'' quoted a World Jewish Congress spokesman as saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/67809/irans-ahmadinejad-wants-come-london-olympics|title=Iran's Ahmadinejad wants to come to the London Olympics|publisher=Jewish Chronicle|date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish refugees from Arab countries===
The issue of [[Jewish refugees from Arab lands]] continues to be on the World Jewish Congress agenda today. The WJC website states that "The plight of Jews who fled from, or still live in, Arab lands and their specific concerns are not well-known and need to be raised with governments and international organizations. Where illegal seizure of assets took place, these should be returned to their former owners, or adequate compensation should be paid. Jews remaining in Arab lands, as well as other religious minorities, should be granted religious freedom and allowed to practice their faith according to their traditions. Jewish communal sites in Arab countries must be preserved and respected." The WJC believes that the plight of the Jewish refugees from Arab lands has been neglected for decades by the international community, including governments and international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/2|title=WJC &amp; Jews From Arab Lands|publisher=|access-date=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122939/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/2|archive-date=2012-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the WJC co-hosted two conferences on the issue, together with the Israeli government. They were held in Jerusalem and at the [[United Nations]] headquarters in New York, respectively. The aim was to raise the profile of the issue and enlist international support. In a speech to the New York symposium, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder urged the world to recognize the suffering of Jewish refugees. "Now is the time to set the historical, diplomatic and legal record straight. Lasting peace can only be built on historical facts - both the issues of the Jewish refugees and the Palestinian refugees must be addressed." Lauder said that "only addressing the historical facts" could help to bring about peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/12336/peace_only_possible_if_plight_of_jewish_refugees_from_arab_countries_is_addressed_lauder_tells_un|title=Peace only possible if plight of Jewish refugees from Arab countries is addressed, Lauder tells UN|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Jerusalem conference, a joint declaration was adopted calling on the United Nations to place the issue of Jewish refugees on its agenda and that of its affiliated forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/d0a520a41e671e66473c81cbbc5bc792c553fb93.pdf|title=Jerusalem Declaration on Justice for Jews from Arab Countries|publisher=|access-date=2012-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024065533/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/d0a520a41e671e66473c81cbbc5bc792c553fb93.pdf|archive-date=2012-10-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian critics derided the move to raise this issue now as a "manipulative strategy". It was "part of a public relations campaign that is both cynical and hypocritical", PLO Executive member [[Hanan Ashrawi]] told the newspaper [[USA Today]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/10/11/jewish-refugees-from-war-of-independence-seek-justice/1621037/|title=Jewish refugees want 'justice' like Palestinians, some say it's a ploy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the conferences, Israel's Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] instructed Israeli diplomats around the world to raise the matter in all official government meetings and with parliamentarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=289051|title=Diaspora - Jewish people world news - The Jerusalem Post|website=www.jpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to figures provided by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, approximately 850,000 Jews from Arab states across the Middle East left their native countries following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 due to state-sponsored persecution. Most of them were forced to abandon their property and possessions, the ministry said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=284548|title=PM: Israel must bring justice to Jewish Refugees - Jerusalem Post, 10 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other issues===
In August 2008, World Jewish Congress and Venezuelan Jewish community leaders met in Caracas with Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez Frias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/3716|title=Venezuela Analysis: Venezuela's Chavez Meets with President of World Jewish Congress|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting stirred some controversy in the Jewish world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/comment/4668/shame-those-our-leaders-who-back-chavez|title=Jewish Chronicle - Isi Leibler: Shame on those of our leaders who back Chavez|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of Chávez' public support for Iranian leader [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] and his strong criticism of Israel. However, then WJC Secretary-General Michael Schneider defended the meeting with Chávez and said the WJC acted only on behalf of, and with the backing of, the Venezuelan Jewish community.

Following the exclusion of Israeli tennis player [[Shahar Peer]] from an [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] tournament in Dubai in February 2009, the WJC called for the "suspension of all sporting events in the [United Arab Emirates] until Israeli participants are admitted." The response of the women's and men's tours to the exclusion of Peer had been "faint-hearted," and they should have canceled the event immediately, WJC President Lauder was quoted by the news agency [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] as saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/9061/israel_player_ram_to_get_dubai_visa_congressman_says|title=Israel Player Ram to Get Dubai Visa, Congressman Says|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, the World Jewish Congress criticized the president of the [[International Olympic Committee]], [[Jacques Rogge]], for not agreeing to hold one minute's silence at the opening ceremony in remembrance of the [[Munich Massacre|eleven Israeli sportsmen killed by Palestinian terrorists during the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972]]. Ronald Lauder said Rogge's stance was "unfeeling" and "completely out of touch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/22/sport/olympics-munich-silence/index.html|title=Olympics head rejects silence for Israeli victims - CNN|first=By Richard Allen Greene,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "Forty years after the saddest moment in Olympic history - when eleven Israeli athletes and sports officials and a German police officer were killed by Palestinian terrorists - it would have been an excellent opportunity to show to everyone that the sports world stands united against terrorism ... Nobody wants to 'politicize' the Olympic Games, as the IOC seems to suggest, but Baron Rogge and his colleagues on the IOC Executive have utterly failed - or refused - to grasp the importance of such a symbolic act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/jewish-group-slams-olympics-for-refusing-munich-massacre-minute-of-silence-1.452910|title=Haaretz.Com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundraising and finances==
The WJC raises its funds mainly through the World Jewish Congress American Section, which is a non-profit body registered in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/donate_support|title=Donate Today - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2013-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829021554/https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/donate_support|archive-date=2013-08-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies, internal conflicts and allegations of financial irregularities (2004-2007)===
A series of allegations about the organization's accounting practices and "unusual" money transfers, was raised in 2004 by [[Isi Leibler]], then a vice-president of the WJC. It led to an investigation of the finances of the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref name=buncombe/&gt; A comprehensive audit of the WJC's accounts in Switzerland from 1995–2004, conducted by the accounting firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], reportedly found that "over the years $3.8 million 'disappeared' from the bank accounts"&lt;ref name=barkat&gt;{{cite web|last=Barkat |first=Amiram |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/828961.html |title=Where was Edgar Bronfman? | work=Haaretz  |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there were "significant un-reconciled cash withdrawals where there is no documentation of the usage of the funds."&lt;ref name=popperwjcaudit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/wjc-audit-4-million-unaccounted-for/ |title=WJC Audit: $3 Million Unaccounted For – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2006-11-03 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, an investigation by the Office of the NY State Attorney General into the matter found no evidence of criminal conduct on the part of the WJC.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Strom, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/us/16jewish.html World Jewish Congress Dismisses Leader]", [[The New York Times]], March 16, 2007. Retrieved June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the report of Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]] noted that the WJC had implemented all of his recommendations to improve financial oversight and management.

Spitzer's office identified financial mismanagement and breaches of fiduciary duty, but found no criminal wrongdoing and concluded that any misconduct "did not compromise the core mission" of the organization or result in "identifiable losses of charitable assets."&lt;ref name=edenpopper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/ny-probe-of-charity-cites-mismanagement/ |title=N.Y. Probe of Charity Cites Mismanagement – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2006-02-03 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also highlighted several initiatives the WJC had taken since 2004 to improve financial management, including "the creation of an audit committee and the position of chief financial officer, the computerization of all financial records, the creation of an employee handbook outlining official procedures and policies, the implementation of travel and reimbursement procedures, and the creation of a new fund-raising entity (the WJC Foundation)."&lt;ref&gt;Ami Eden and Nathanial Popper, "[http://forward.com/articles/1583/ny-probe-of-charity-cites-mismanagement NY Probe of Charity Cites Mismanagement]," [[The Jewish Daily Forward]], February 3, 2006. Retrieved June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite vigorously defending [[Israel Singer]] during the Attorney General's inquiry, in March 2007 Bronfman abruptly announced his firing. He accused Singer of "'help[ing] himself to cash from the WJC office, my cash."&lt;ref name=barkat2&gt;{{cite web|last=Barkat |first=Amiram |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/841279.html |title=Members of the Tribe / The end of a beautiful friendship - Haaretz Daily Newspaper &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, internal WJC documents seemed to suggest that a friction had developed between Singer and Bronfman over Singer's position on various internal WJC political matters, including the perception that he was insufficiently advocating the candidacy of Edgar Bronfman's son [[Matthew Bronfman|Matthew]] to the presidency of the WJC.&lt;ref name=popperduo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/ugly-allegations-fly-as-fabled-wjc-duo-splits/ |title=Ugly Allegations Fly as Fabled WJC Duo Splits – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2007-03-23 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
