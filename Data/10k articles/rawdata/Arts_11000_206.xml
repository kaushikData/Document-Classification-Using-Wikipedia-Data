The '''Basilica of the Holy Blood''' ({{lang-nl|Heilig-Bloedbasiliek}}, {{lang-fr|Basilique du Saint-Sang}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[basilica]] in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]]. The church houses a venerated relic of the [[Blood of Christ|Holy Blood]] allegedly collected by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and brought from the [[Holy Land]] by [[Thierry of Alsace]], [[Count of Flanders]]. Built between 1134 and 1157 as the [[chapel]] of the [[Count of Flanders]], it was promoted to a [[minor basilica]] in 1923.

The basilica in Burg square consists of a lower and upper chapel. The lower chapel, dedicated to [[St. Basil the Great]], is a dark [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] structure that remains virtually unchanged. The venerated relic is in the upper chapel, which was rebuilt in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style in the 16th century and renovated in the 19th century in [[Gothic Revival]] style.

== History ==
In 1134, Thierry of Alsace decided to build a private double chapel next to the ''{{lang|nl|Oud Steen}}'', the first residence of the Counts of Flanders, transformed today into the [[town hall]] of Bruges. Thierry went on crusade a second time in 1147 during the [[Second Crusade]]. According to the tradition, Thierry of Alsace returned to his capital Bruges on April 7, 1150, with the relic of the [[Blood of Christ|Precious Blood]]. During the first half of the 13th century, the name of the upper chapel was changed to the Chapel of the Holy Blood.&lt;ref name="gids"/&gt;

The chapel of Saint Basil is one of the best preserved churches in Romanesque style of [[West-Flanders]].&lt;ref name="gids" /&gt; Built from 1134 to 1149, the chapel is dedicated to [[St. Basil the Great]] of whom a relic was brought back by Count [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert II]] from [[Caesarea Mazaca]] in [[Cappadocia]], [[Asia Minor]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]).

The chapel consists of two side naves and a central nave continued by the choir, which in turn is ended by a semi-circular [[apse]]. In the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] above the entrance linking the chapel and the annex is a 12th-century representation of the baptism of Saint Basil. In the right nave, the ''seated Madonna and Child'' (''[[Sedes Sapientiae]]'') is a wooden polychrome sculpture of the early 14th century. Carried each year during the procession, two venerated wooden statues, made around 1900 and representing ''Jesus on the Cold Stone'' and the ''Pieta'' are displayed.

At the left of the choir, the chapel of Saint Yves was added in 1504 and houses the relics of Saint Basil and of Blessed [[Charles the Good]], Count of Flanders. The black marble retable is allegedly executed from designs by [[Lancelot Blondeel]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

== Chapel of the Holy Blood ==

Originally built in Romanesque style like the St Basil chapel, the upper chapel was transformed in Gothic Style at the end of the 15th century and again in 1823. Only the curved arches giving access to the side chapel of the Holy Cross remain from the original Romanesque chapel.

The monumental staircase, commonly named ''{{lang|nl|De Steegheere}}'', which leads to the upper chapel, was built in from 1529 to 1533 in late Gothic and Renaissance style according to the drawings of Flemish painter and architect [[Lancelot Blondeel|William Aerts]],&lt;ref name="gids" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weale|first=W. H. James|year=1908|title=Lancelot Blondeel-I|journal=[[The Burlington Magazine|The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs]]|volume=14|issue=68|pages=96–101|issn=0007-6287}}&lt;/ref&gt; ornamented on the outside with sculpted statues. The aftermath of the French Revolution left the staircase badly damaged and it was decided in 1832 to move it {{convert|4|m}} backwards and to rebuild it after removing the remaining ruins of the ''Oud Steen''.&lt;ref name="gids" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is considered to be the first artistic renovation carried out by the recently created [[Belgium|Belgian State]].&lt;/ref&gt; The gilded bronze statues represent Archduchess [[Isabelle of Burgundy]], [[Mary of Burgundy]], Thierry of Alsace and [[Philip of Alsace]] and, in the medallions, the Archdukes of Austria [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert VII]] and [[Maximilian III of Austria|Maximilian III]], [[Margaret of York]] and [[Sibylla of Anjou]], wife of Thierry and daughter of King [[Fulk of Jerusalem]].

During the 19th century, successive renovation campaigns gave to the chapel its final [[Gothic Revival]] aspect, with its characteristic mural decorations. The stained-glass windows in the choir date from 1845&lt;ref&gt;The original stained-glass windows were removed after the [[French Revolution]]. Some of the original ones ended up in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;/ref&gt; and represent the sovereigns who reigned over the County of Flanders from [[Philip the Bold]], [[duke of Burgundy]], till Archduchess [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], [[Holy Roman emperor|Holy Roman empress]].

The following architects and artists took part in these [[neo-Gothic]] renovations of the Chapel of the Holy Blood:&lt;ref name="gids" /&gt;
* [[Jean-Baptiste Bethune (architect)|Jean-Baptiste Bethune]]
* [[Louis Delacenserie]]
* [[Thomas Harper King]]
* [[William Curtis Brangwyn]], father of [[Frank Brangwyn]]

The pulpit in the form of a globe dates was made in 1728 by [[Henry Pulinckx]], inspired by its evangelical purpose : "''Go into all the world and preach the gospel''" {{bibleverse||Mark|16:15|NIV|}}.

The large wall-painting behind the high altar was realized in 1905. In the upper part, the ''Mystery of the Cross'' depicts Christ shedding his blood, with, in the background, the towns of Bethlehem, where Christ was born, and Jerusalem where he died. The lower part depicts the transport of the relic from Jerusalem to Bruges: on the left, Thierry of Alsace receives the relic from [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]], King of Jerusalem ; on the right, kneeling besides Countess [[Sibylla of Anjou]], he hands over the relic to the chaplain.

The high altar used today for the Eucharist is decorated with a relief in alabaster from the beginning of the 17th century depicting the Last Supper. Typical attributes of a basilica, the [[tintinnabulum]], the small processional bell, and the [[Umbraculum]], the sunscreen in the form of a parasol in yellow and red silk, are displayed next to the high altar.

[[Laurent Delvaux]] completed in 1751 the white marble altar in Baroque style for the relic side chapel. The two adoring angels were made by [[Peter Pepers]]. The relic is kept in a magnificent silver tabernacle made by local silversmith François Ryelandt (1709–1774), representing the "[[Lamb of Christ]]". To the right of the altar, the painting of [[Jacob van Oost]] depicts the descent from the Cross.  The relic is shown to the public every Friday and every day two weeks before Ascension Day.

== Relic of the Precious Blood ==
[[File:The Blood Relic.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Relic of the [[Blood of Christ|Holy Blood]], [[Bruges]].]]

The basilica is best known as the repository of a venerated [[phial]] said to contain a cloth with blood of [[Jesus Christ]], brought to the city by Thierry of Alsace after the 12th century [[Second Crusade]].&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vinc" /&gt;

Although the Bible never mentions Christ's blood being preserved, one of the [[apocryphal gospels]] asserts that [[Joseph of Arimathea]] preserved the [[Precious Blood]] after he had washed the dead body of Christ. The daily making present of the [[Blood of Christ]] during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] was central in the religious life of the [[Middle Age]] in Europe. If genuine, a relic of the Blood of Jesus would be of utmost significance, a uniquely important witness to Jesus’ Passion and a perpetual reminder of the historical character of the Christian Gospel.&lt;ref name="Vinc" /&gt;

Popular legend asserts that the phial was taken to Bruges during the [[Second Crusade]] of [[Common Era|CE]] 1147–1149, by Thierry of Alsace, who returned from Jerusalem with the relic of the [[Blood of Christ|Holy Blood]] presented to him by his brother-in-law [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]], as the reward of his great services.&lt;ref name="Nick"&gt;{{cite book | last = Nickell | first = Joe | title = Relics of the Christ | chapter=Blood of Jesus|publisher = University Press of Kentucky | location = Lexington | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-8131-2425-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A9sj9XmdmekC&amp;pg=PA169|pages=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, recent research found no evidences of the presence of the relic in Bruges before the 1250s.&lt;ref name="Vinc"/&gt; In all likelihood, the relic originated from the 1204 [[sack of Constantinople]] by the army of the [[Counts of Flanders|Count of Flanders]], [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin IX]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref name="Vinc"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vincent | first = Nicholas | title = The Holy Blood: King Henry III and the Westminster Blood relic | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-521-57128-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H8F28cKVdwAC&amp;pg=PA73|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since, the phial has played no small part in the religious life of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy| wstitle=Bruges| title =Bruges| first = Cyril| last = J.| authorlink = | accessdate =2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Clement V]] issued a [[papal bull]] in 1310 granting [[indulgences]] to pilgrims who visited the chapel to view the relic.

Recent investigations have showed that the phial, made of rock crystal and dating back to the 11th or 12th century,&lt;ref name="Nick"/&gt; was a Byzantine perfume bottle made in the area of [[Constantinople]]. It was never opened since its arrival in Bruges. Its neck is wound with gold thread and its stopper is sealed with red wax. The phial is encased in a glass-fronted gold cylinder closed at each end by [[coronets]] decorated with angels. The date "''MCCCLXXXVIII die III maii''" (May 3, 1388) is engraved on the frame.&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt;

== Procession of the Holy Blood ==
{{main article|Procession of the Holy Blood}}

The reliquary used during the procession is displayed in the Basilica Museum. The shrine was made in 1617 in Bruges by [[goldsmith]] [[Jan Crabbe]] from some {{convert|30|kg|lb}} of gold and silver and more than 100 precious stones. It consists of a gem-encrusted hexagonal case topped by golden statues representing Jesus-Christ, The [[Virgin Mary]], [[Saint Donatian|St. Donatian]] and [[St. Basil the Great]].

==Jeu du Saint Sang==
''Jeu du Saint Sang'' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[passion play]], performed in [[Bruges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotelara.com/belgium/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905073629/http://www.hotelara.com/belgium/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-05 |title=Belgium travel guide |publisher=Hotelara |date= |accessdate=2013-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in 1938, and translated into French by [[Émile Schwartz]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Boon, ''Sanguis Christi, Le jeu du Saint Sang de Bruges'', in three acts and a prologue, French translation Émile Schwartz, éd. Renouveau « La Source », Bruxelles, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In the 2008 movie ''[[In Bruges]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0780536|Memorable quotes for [[In Bruges]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Ken pays a visit to the relic of the Holy Blood.  However, the privately owned Church of Jerusalem ({{lang-nl|Jerusalemkerk}})—built in the 15th century according to the plans of the [[Holy Sepulcher]] in Jerusalem—was used instead of the Basilica.

'''Cesare Biseo''' (April 18, 1843 – January 25, 1909) was an [[Italy|Italian]] painter known mainly for his [[Orientalism|orientalist]] themes.

==Biography==

He was born in Rome to a family originally from [[Brescia]]. He trained under his father. He initially worked in decorative paintings of houses. Biseo was invited by the [[Khedive|Viceroy of Egypt]] to [[Alexandria, Egypt]], to decorate his palace. This trip gave him subjects for future works as painter. He returned to the Muslim world; for example, in the company of [[Stefano Ussi]] and [[Edmondo De Amicis]]. They were part of the first embassy to [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140124142556/https://it-it.facebook.com/events/281123258565516/ Gli Orientalisti] exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; With De Amicis, Biseo published a book on observations in ''Morocco'' and ''Costantinople'', edited by the brothers Treves of [[Milan]]. In the 1887 Mostra di Venezia, he exhibited watercolors titled: ''Ricordi de Cairo''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz0bAAAAYAAJ  ''Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti.''], by [[Angelo de Gubernatis]]. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chasse''', '''châsse''' or  '''box reliquary''' is a shape commonly used in medieval metalwork for [[reliquaries]] and other containers.  To the modern eye the form resembles a house, though a tomb or church was more the intention,&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;Distelberger, 21&lt;/ref&gt; with an oblong base, straight sides and two sloping top faces meeting at a central ridge, often marked by a raised strip and decoration.  From the sides there are therefore triangular "gable" areas.  The casket usually stands on straight stumpy feet, and there is a hinged opening to allow access, either one of the panels, but not on the front face, or the wooden bottom; there is usually a lock.&lt;ref&gt;Distelberger, 19. See also Sotheby's&lt;/ref&gt;  The shape possibly developed from a similar shape of [[sarcophagus]] that goes back to [[Etruscan art]], or from [[Early Medieval]] [[Insular art]], where there are a number of reliquaries or [[cumdach]]s ("book-shrines") with similar shapes, like the [[Monymusk Reliquary]], although in these typically there are four sloping panels above, so no "gables"; a 13th-century example of this type is the chasse of [[Saint Exupère]] (see gallery of images, below). The word derives, via the French ''châsse'', from the Latin ''capsa'', meaning "box".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Chasse"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the term==
In English the word may or may not be italicised, and if it is may use the French [[circumflex]]: ''châsse''.  Regardless of the form used, the term in English is normally only used of "house"-shaped boxes, usually enamelled ones, whereas in French it is a general term for reliquaries with a box, "shrine" or casket form, of any shape, and tends to be used especially for larger examples.  The chasse shape was also used for most of the much larger, and far grander, reliquary shrines made by goldsmiths for cathedrals and great monasteries, like the [[Reliquary Shrine of Saint Eleutherius]]  in the [[cathedral of Tournai]], but these featured elaborate three-dimensional decoration, with gold or silver-gilt the predominant impression. These are less often described as chasses in English, though they are likely to be so termed in French, where the term ''châsse'' mostly refers to large [[sarcophagus]]-sized reliquaries. In larger chasses the shape may be more complex, as in the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]] in [[Cologne]], which has "side-roofs" like an aisled church.

==Development==
The development of the [[champlevé]] enamel technique made enamel decoration far easier and so cheaper than the previous fiddly [[cloisonné]] process, and enabled much larger surfaces to be covered in a single firing. The enamel chasse was developed to exploit these new possibilities.  By the 12th century, the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] chasse had become popular as a relatively cheap form for reliquaries, especially for the [[vitreous enamel|enamelled]] caskets made in [[Limoges]] and Spain, which were exported all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Osbourne, 332-333&lt;/ref&gt;  Limoges was on one of the main [[pilgrimage|pilgrim]] routes [[Way of St. James|to Santiago de Compostela]], which probably helped distribution.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;Hermitage&lt;/ref&gt; These were made round a wooden core, usually consisting of seven pieces of [[oak]] which were primed and painted,&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt; to which fairly thin sheets of [[copper]] decorated in champlevé enamel and [[gilding]] were nailed with pins with rounded gilt heads.  The flat panels were fired before the box was assembled around the wooden core, using "assembling marks" on the wood and the rear of the metal plates.  In the late 14th century a new all-metal method of construction was developed, with chasses "fitted together by an ingenious system of slots, lugs, and [[dovetail]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Stohlman, 390&lt;/ref&gt;  There were sometimes gems, usually in fact made of glass,&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt; set on the faces, and especially into the roof-ridge, which often has finials and a row of keyhole shaped openings.  

Though still luxury products, enamel chasses were cheap compared to a custom-made object from a goldsmith, and the effect impressive and colourful.  The solidity of the boxes, and the difficulty of recovering the relatively low value of the gold used, has meant a high survival rate compared to other types of medieval metalwork, at least for religious chasses; over 700 medieval Limoges chasses survive, often in very good condition.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;  In the earlier examples only the figures and decorative roundels were enamelled, but in the 13th century this was usually reversed, with an enamelled background, generally dominated by blue, and figures just engraved and gilded.  A group from the end of the 12th century with some sixty survivals have enamelled figures and "vermiculated" gilded backgrounds "incised in a pattern of densely interwoven vine scrolls and tendrils".&lt;ref&gt;Distelberger, 21 (quoted); Osbourne, 333&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, as in the examples illustrated, the heads alone were modelled in relief, but sometimes whole figures, usually by hammering from behind into a mould.  After several decades they were being produced by workshops in large numbers, using standard patterns, and could be afforded by relatively small parish churches.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A; Osbourne, 332-333&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Reliquary Thomas Becket MNMA Cl23296.jpg|thumb|left|Chasse with [[Thomas Becket]]'s murder below, and burial above.]]

The shape was used for other purposes, and secular designs were made, although far fewer of these have survived.  The enamel workshops modified their style slightly to reflect the coming of [[Gothic art|the Gothic]], and were still producing chasses in the 14th century and beyond, although quality had by now fallen somewhat, and the best quality enamel work was now in the new ''[[basse-taille]]'' technique.&lt;ref&gt;Osbourne, 333&lt;/ref&gt;  Production was already in decline, but the industry never recovered from the [[Siege of Limoges|sack of Limoges in 1370]] by the English under [[Edward, the Black Prince]]. Limoges had been part of the [[Plantaganet]] "[[Angevin Empire]]" since 1150, but the city had annoyed the Black Prince by surrendering to the French earlier, and 3,000 of the ciizens are said to have been killed in the sack.

==Subjects==
Many enamel chasses had static subjects including angels, standing saints and ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'', but narrative subjects were also popular, including the story of the Three [[Biblical Magi]], usually in two scenes, the ''[[Journey of the Magi]]'' above and ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' on the main face, the latter featuring on some 26 Limoges chasses.  Their three bodies had been "rediscovered" near [[Milan]] in 1158, and were translated to the magnificent [[Shrine of the Three Kings]] in [[Cologne Cathedral]] in 1164;&lt;ref&gt;Distelberger, 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that fragments of the old stone Milan shrine were treated as relics, explaining the demand for Magi reliquaries.&lt;ref&gt;Gaulthier, 101&lt;/ref&gt;  

The murder of [[Thomas Becket]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in 1170, was rapidly followed by his [[canonisation]] in 1173, and became a very common subject on chasses, with 52 surviving, usually showing his burial above and murder below, as in the [[Becket Casket]] in the [[V&amp;A Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;"V&amp;A plaque", with latest count; Binski, 225, with a catalogue entry on one in the [[Burrell Collection]] in [[Glasgow]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Becket's body was carefully preserved, but pieces of his clothes and other possessions were treated as relics, and were deliberately widely distributed by [[Canterbury]] to promote his cult from the 1170s until about 1220.&lt;ref&gt;"V&amp;A plaque"&lt;/ref&gt;  The otherwise obscure [[Valerie of Limoges|Saint Valerie]] came from [[Limoges]], and has 22 surviving chasses showing her life, reflecting her popularity in the region; the lives of [[Saint Stephen]], dedicatee of [[Limoges Cathedral]] and [[Saint Martial]], its first bishop, are also represented on chasses.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Figures of saints on chasses often lack identifying [[emblem|attributes]], enabling purchasers to identify them with whatever saints they chose, or needed to match their relics.&lt;ref&gt;Distelberger, 22&lt;/ref&gt; The most elaborate designs usually only appear on the front and sides; the rear faces, usually not visible, are typically more simply decorated with geometric patterns or beasts in roundels rather than figure compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Distelberger, 21. See also Sotheby's&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Colossal Statue of Shapur I.jpg|thumb|300px|The Colossal Statue of Shapur I]]
The '''Colossal Statue of Shapur I''', a statue of [[Shapur I]] (AD 240&amp;ndash;272), the second king of the [[Sassanid Empire]], stands in the so-called [[Shapur cave]], a huge [[limestone]] cave located about 6&amp;nbsp;km from the ancient city of [[Bishapur]] in the south of [[Iran]]. The statue is about 35&amp;nbsp;m from the cave entrance, on the fourth of five terraces, lying approximately 3.4&amp;nbsp;m below the level of the cave entrance. Its height of about 6.7&amp;nbsp;m and breadth across the shoulders of more than 2&amp;nbsp;m make it one of the most impressive sculptures from the Sassanian period.

== Characteristic features of the colossal statue ==
[[File:Fallen statue in the cave at Shahpoor.jpg|thumb|300px|Fallen statue of Shapur I, 1817]]
[[File:Shapour the Great (Shapour I) 241 AD – 272 AD.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A reconstruction by [[George Rawlinson]], 1876]]
The monumental sculpture is chiseled from a huge [[stalagmite]] grown in situ, but it no longer stands exactly in its original position. After its fall (probably caused by an earthquake), the sculpture was raised onto two concrete pillars, which are located near the original feet. The head and the body of the sculpture have remained quite well preserved while parts of its arms and almost all of both legs are missing.

The colossal statue is rich in detail. It is chiseled on every side with the same amount of extraordinary care and attention. The king wears a crenellated [[Crown (headgear)|crown]]. A large piece of the front crenellation is missing, while the crenellations of both sides and the rear are well preserved. At the lower end of the crown, there is a wide [[diadem]]. The two bands of the diadem fall heavily down the back to the waist and widen from top to bottom. Around twenty horizontal, parallel furrows cross on these bands. The head of the sculpture has been carved out in all its particulars symmetrically. The hairstyle of the colossal statue shows a high degree of sculptural definition. The mass of hair on the left side of the sculpture has remained intact while the ends of strands of hair on the right side are broken off. Of the left arm of the sculpture, only half remains. The missing left hand of the sculpture must have once rested on the [[sword]] handle. The right arm is broken off just below the axilla. A small part of the right underarm is still attached. The right hand is strongly weathered and rests on the waist.

The clothing of the colossal statue consists of three pieces: an undervest, an upper garment and wide trousers. The upper garment of the sculpture fits tightly to the body and appears to be made of a sheer fabric. Through its skin-tight fit, the shoulders, the upper arms and the chest of the king have been emphasized. The sculpted ornaments on the upper garment are quite remarkable insofar as they resemble flames flickering downward. These are varyingly long, shaped in several different ways and irregularly arranged. At the waist, the upper garment is held together tightly by a belt while a second belt, which is hanging loosely around the hips, functions to fasten on the sword scabbard.

Only small parts of the legs of the sculpture have remained. The small remaining piece of the left thigh supports a conclusion that the ruler was wearing fluted trousers. The fact that the trousers of Shapur I originally reached the ground is evident from the traces of folds encircling the original feet of the sculpture at irregular intervals. It stands to reason that the sculptor designed the length of the trousers not only for aesthetical reasons but also to increase the sculpture's stability. The long trousers would have functioned to enlarge contact area with the ground and to spread the stress of the colossal statue, which weighs several tonnes.
 
The two feet of the sculpture are slightly spread. The left foot is lying a little ahead of the right foot. The original shoes of the colossal statue now have a contrasting conservation status. The right shoe is largely destroyed. The left shoe is virtually intact and has a round toe cap. The broad shoelaces, pleated lengthways, meander in an S-shape onto the ground.

On the colossal statue of Shapur I, there are three pieces of jewellery: a necklace, earrings made of large [[pearl]]s and an armlet on the right wrist.

== Identification of the statue ==
In the Sassanian period, the crowns' details were subject to stringent regulations and varied from one king to another. Each Sassanian king possessed his own crown, designed at the time of his accession to power.
Because of the shape of the crown (diadem, the crenellated part and [[korymbos]]) and on the basis of [[Art history|art historical]] considerations, the colossal statue can be clearly identified as Shapur I, the second Sassanian king.

== Reconstruction of the crown ==
Shapur I is not always shown wearing a crenellated crown, but he is never represented with a crenellated crown without a korymbos. A korymbos, or globular-shaped structure, sat originally on the top of the crown of the sculpture standing in the cave. The presence of a borehole on the vertex indicates that the korymbos could not have been of stone, but consisted of metal. The korymbos of the colossal statue was originally 1.5 m high and 1 m wide. After research and experimentation at the University of Basel, it was found that a korymbos of metal of a suitable size would have weighed more than a tonne even with a very low wall thickness.

== Hairstyle as an important criterion for dating the statue ==
Below the diadem, the hair springs thickly up. There are four rows of strands that are very clearly distinguishable from each other and lying in waves on top of each other, on both sides of the face. The wave patterns of the individual strands are almost identical, but at their tips, the heavily stylized, nearly spherical curls differ. The end of the top strand is rolled up on each side of the head like a snail. The underlying strands have differing forms of braided knots at their ends. The wavy strands billow out on each side across the shoulders with the curl of the lowest and shortest strand lying on the shoulder.

This kind of [[hairstyle]] can be only seen on those rock reliefs of Shapur I that were carved after 260 AD and is, therefore, the most important criterion for the precise dating of the colossal statue of Shapur I. Due to the details of the hairstyle, G. Reza Garosi succeeded to date the colossal statue exactly in the second half of the sixties of third century AD.

== Sculptor ==
The anonymous sculptor of the colossal statue of Shapur I must be considered one of the greatest sculptors in the [[ancient Near East]]. It is certain that he succeeded in finishing the colossal statue. According to post-Sassanian reports, the sculpture, which weighed several tonnes, stood on its own feet at least until the 14th century AD. An adept sculptor was not the only master for creating this sculpture – a skilled [[metalsmith]] was also involved in this work. The metalsmith was responsible for making the korymbos of metal and had to fix it firmly onto the crown of the colossal statue. The addition of a metal korymbos was indeed an innovation and is not known from any other statue in the ancient Near East. In the Sassanian era, no other statues with similar dimensions have been discovered. Thus, the colossal statue of Shapur I must be considered as an absolute exception in the history of Sassanian sculptural art.

== State of research ==
Although the colossal statue of Shapur I is known in Europe since at least 1811, it was not dealt detailed till recently. It was mentioned, for example, by [[Roman Ghirshman]], [[Kurt Erdmann]] and [[Georgina Herrmann]]. The first comprehensive research about the cave and the colossal statue of Shapur I was done by G. Reza Garosi.

'''A designer''' is a person who makes [[design]]s for objects. A [[fashion designer]] designs clothing, a [[web designer]] designs web pages, and an [[automobile design]]er designs automobiles. In each case, the designer works with the help of a technician or [[engineer]] who understands deeper level concepts of [[manufacturing]] and engineering, and the designer themself is largely confined to work at a surface level.   

More formally, a designer is an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] that "specifies the structural properties of a design [[Object (philosophy)|object]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P. and Wand, Y. (2009). A proposal for a formal definition of the design concept. In Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., editors, Design Requirements Workshop (LNBIP 14), pp. 103–136. Springer-Verlag, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, anyone who creates tangible or intangible objects, products, processes, laws, games, graphics, services, and experiences is referred to as a designer.

==Overview==
Classically, the main area of design was only [[architecture]], which was understood as the major arts. The design of [[clothing]], [[furniture]], and other common artifacts were left mostly to tradition or artisans specializing in hand making them.

Design is a part of the [[Visual communication|communication arts]], [[design]] is something you plan to create, it communicates to the viewer or user a visual and emotional message to change or guide  through an emotional connection with a product or service enhancing their experience of the product or [[brand]]

With the increasing complexity in [[industrial design]] of today’s society, and due to the needs of [[mass production]] where more time is usually associated with more cost, the production methods became more complex and with them, the way designs and their production is created. The classical areas are now subdivided into smaller and more specialized domains of design (landscape design, urban design, exterior design, interior design, industrial design, furniture design, cloth design, and much more) according to the product designed or perhaps its means of production. Despite the variety of specializations within the design industry, all of them are very closely connected in terms of the need of professionals having a eye for design and being inspired by each other.

When designers speak of [[graphic design]] they speak of it in terms of simplifying complexity so users do not feel overwhelmed when faced with complex systems. More information can lead to a better, simpler solution to whatever problem the designer is trying to solve. Using [[research methodology]] to solve problems is one of the most important aspects of design, it enables the designer to properly assess the clients and audience needs. Part of a designer's job is to get to know the audience they intend on canvassing and what will be the placement of any produced material created.

The education, experience, and genetic blocks that form the base of a competent designer is normally similar no matter the area of specialization, only in a later stages of training and work will designer diverge to a specialized field. The methods of teaching or the program and theories followed vary according to schools and field of study.
Today, a design team, no matter the scale of the equipment, is usually composed by a master designer (the head of the team) that will have the responsibility to take decisions about the way the creative process should evolve, and a number of technical designers (the hands of the team) specialized in diverse areas according to the product proposed, depending on the type of design [[industrial design]] vs [[graphic design]] for example. For more complex products, the team will also be composed of professionals from other areas like engineers, advertising specialists, and others as required.
The relationships established between team members will vary according to proposed product, the processes of production, the equipment available, or the theories followed during the idea development, but normally they are not too restrictive, giving an opportunity to everyone in the team to take a part in the creation process or at least to express an idea.

'''Fine press''' [[printing]] and [[publishing]] comprises historical and contemporary printers and publishers publishing [[book]]s and other printed matter of exceptional intrinsic quality and artistic taste, including both commercial and [[private press]]es.  Their dedication to fine printing distinguishes them from other [[small press]]es.  Fine press publications are often published in [[limited edition]]s, that are swiftly bought up by [[Book collecting|book collectors]] and libraries.

==History of fine press==

As part of the [[Art Nouveau]] movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Englishman [[William Morris]] wanted to hearken back to a golden age of printing, printmaking, and publishing.  One of the books they published was the [[Kelmscott Chaucer]].  Soon, fine presses began to spring up in the United States as well.  The most prominent was the [[Roycroft Press]].  Los Angeles was a center of the fine press movement, particularly centered on the Ward Ritchie press

'''Frederic Lloyd''', [[OBE]] (1 July 1918 – 27 July 1995), was an English theatre manager.  Most notably, Lloyd was the General Manager of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] from 1951 until its closure in 1982.

==Biography==
Lloyd was born into an ecclesiastical family near [[Oxford]], England.  During the [[Second World War]] he worked with the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, the precursor of the [[Arts Council]].&lt;ref name=Times&gt;''[[The Times]]'' obituary, 23 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 he was a director of the [[Festival of Britain]],&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and in September of that year he was appointed General Manager of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and of the [[Savoy Theatre]], in succession to Alfred Nightingale.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, Appendix, p. v&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to his D'Oyly Carte duties, Lloyd was a member of the council of management of the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] and played an important part in saving the orchestra's tour of [[Americas|America]] in 1963 at a critical time in the RPO's fortunes.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1961 to 1982, Lloyd was also secretary of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust.  In 1966 he was elected President of the Theatrical Managers' Association.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 23 December 1966, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

With D'Oyly Carte's closure, Lloyd retired from theatre management, although he continued to sit on numerous committees.  He was chairman of the governors of the [[Royal Academy of Music]], 1980-83, and trustee and chairman of the general committee of the [[Garrick Club]], 1976-84.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;  He wrote articles on [[Elgar]] and [[Beethoven]], and he collaborated with [[Robin Wilson (mathematician)|Robin Wilson]] on an official history of the D'Oyly Carte Company in 1984.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

On his retirement, he moved from his London home in [[St John's Wood]] to the village of [[Strathpeffer]], Scotland, near [[Inverness]], where he became a lay-preacher at his local church.  His wife Valerie died in 1991.  They had two sons.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

Lloyd died in Inverness at age 77.&lt;ref&gt;obituary: ''The Independent'' (London), 9 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4026">The '''Friends of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra''' is a non-profit cultural and educational organization based in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]].  It was founded in 1975 by Lola May Thompson and Patricia Whitacre with the mission of supporting the activities of the [[Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra]] and incorporated in 1984.  It is one of the longest continuously operating auxiliary organizations for any professional American [[orchestra]].  
 

==Activities and awards==
The Friends of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra sponsors fundraising events, audience development events, classes in [[music appreciation]], and biannual group tours of major musical centers in [[Europe]].  It has won several awards from national arts organizations, the first one the 1996 "Outstanding Benefit of the Year" award from the [[League of American Orchestras]] for a fund-raising event organized by past presidents Kay Bendel and Betty Reichert in an airplane [[hangar]] in the downtown St. Paul airport. In 2003, the Friends of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra won a Silver Ribbon from the same organization for the classes in music appreciation that it offers to the public under the supervision of the [[musicologist]] [[Daniel E. Freeman]].

With funding from the Patricia Whitacre Memorial Fund, the Friends of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra inaugurated a Youth Chamber Music Competition in February 2012. The competition coordinator is Annette Conklin. The first winner of the competition was the Quartet Tzigane. In 2013, the competition was divided into two levels of competition based on the age of the participants, and in 2018, a Creative Category was initiated.

The '''Glenmasan manuscript''' is a 15th-century Scottish vellum manuscript in the [[National Library of Scotland]], Edinburgh, where it is catalogued as [[Advocates Library|Adv.]] MS 72.2.3. It was previously held in the [[Advocates Library]], Edinburgh, where it was classified as MS 53. The compilation contains [[Scottish Gaelic]] literary texts dealing with matter of the [[Ulster Cycle]], such as the ''[[Táin Bó Flidhais]]'' and ''Oided mac nUisnig'' (the latter a version of ''[[Longes mac n-Uislenn]]'').

==Date and provenance==

The manuscript takes its name from an entry on the front leaf, which appears to state that the original compilation was completed at [[Glen Massan|Glenmasan]] (Glen Masáin, on the [[Cowal]] peninsula in the parish of [[Dunoon]], Argyll) in the year 1238. Based on the alternation of the spelling ''ao'' and ''ai'' for the same diphthong, [[Donald MacKinnon (Scottish Celtic scholar)|Donald MacKinnon]] assigns a date no later than the end of the 15th century and suggests that the manuscript may well have been a first-hand copy of this early 13th-century exemplar. The presence of older linguistic features in the texts points to even earlier strata of writing. MacKinnon therefore proposes the scenario that an early Irish manuscript may have reached Argyll before ''c''. 1238, that about this time, a reworked version was produced, and that the surviving manuscript represents a transcript of the latter made sometime before 1500. A late, anonymous hand on folio 19 wrote ''Leabhar Echdra ata ann so ar a scriobha le Eoin M'Tavis'', "This is a book of adventures written by John M'Tavish", a name which recurs a few times elsewhere in the manuscript and fits the Argyll provenance of the text. He may have been the principal scribe, although there is no way of verifying this claim.

==History==

The earliest history of the manuscript is unknown, although later evidence suggests that it may never have circulated outside of Argyll. Marginal notes rather than external documentation shed some light on its earliest known stages. At the bottom of folio 9 occurs the name of one 'Robert Campbell at [[Glensluan]]' (Argyll), who has been identified as a forester in [[Cowal]] (Argyll) and a poet, who composed an ode to congratulate [[Edward Lhuyd]] on his ''[[Archæologia Britannica]]'' (1707, printed there). William Campbell, Robert's probable great-nephew and minister of [[Kilchrenan]] (since 1745) and [[Dalavich]], is named on folio 15 as having been the one-time owner of the book and so may have acquired it through his grand-uncle. Another explicitly named owner (before 1782) is James McIntyre of [[Glenoe]].

The manuscript appeared in a brighter light in the late 18th century, when the Committee of the [[Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland]] requested proof that the ''[[Ossian]]'' published by [[James Macpherson]] was a translation from genuinely ancient [[Scottish Gaelic]] poetry.&lt;ref name="ftn0"&gt;MacKinnon, "The Glenmasan manuscript." p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Rev. John MacKinnon of [[Glendaruel]] claimed to have received the manuscript from local countrymen, who told him that it was originally kept in the Kilbride Collection. The lawyer [[William Bannatyne, Lord Bannatyne|Lord Bannatyne]] acquired the MS from him and passed it on to the Highland Society. MacKinnon suggests that were it not for the controversy over MacPherson, the manuscript might never have come to light.

A transcript was first made by [[Ewen MacLachlan]] (1773–1822) in his ''Leabhar Caol ''("Narrow Book"). His work was superseded by Donald MacKinnon, who published a diplomatic edition with facing translation in the first four volumes of ''The Celtic Review'' (1904–1908).

==Features==

The manuscript contains 27 leaves in large [[Quarto (text)|quarto]] format, including the two forming the cover. The pages are written in double columns of 38, sometimes 39 lines each. The binding is anomalous at the beginning: the folio which now comes 3rd should have been the 5th, while a gap exists between the 4th and 5th leaf, possibly between the 5th and 3rd and possibly also between the 3rd and 6th folios.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, "Glenmasan." p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''God Defend New Zealand'''" ({{Lang-mi|"'''Aotearoa'''"|lit=New Zealand|italic=no}}) is one of two [[national anthems of New Zealand]], the other being "[[God Save the Queen]]". Legally the two have equal status, but "God Defend New Zealand" is more commonly used. Originally written as a poem, it was set to music as part of a competition in 1876. Over the years its popularity increased, and it was eventually named the second national anthem in 1977. It has English and Māori lyrics, with slightly different meanings. Since the late 1990s, the usual practice when performed in public is to perform the first verse of the national anthem twice, first in Māori and then in English.

With the permission of Queen [[Elizabeth II]], it was gazetted as the country's second national anthem on 21 November 1977, on equal standing with "God Save the Queen".&lt;ref name=Gazette1977&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mch.govt.nz/files/NZ%20Gazette%20Nov%201977%20%28D-0419235%29.PDF |title=Announcement of the adoption of national anthems for New Zealand |date=21 November 1977 |work=Supplement to the New Zealand Gazette of Thursday, 17 November 1977 |accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative official arrangement for massed singing by [[Maxwell Fernie]] was announced by the [[New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs|Minister of Internal Affairs]], [[Allan Highet]] on 31 May 1979.&lt;ref name="Fernie"&gt;{{cite web|title=National anthems: Musical score for God Defend New Zealand|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/nz-identity-heritage/national-anthems/musical-score-god-defend-new-zealand|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods' original score was written in the key of [[A-flat major]] (concert pitch) and was better suited for solo and choral singing; Fernie's arrangement changed the key down a [[semitone]] to [[G major]].

Until the 1990s, only the first verse of the English version was commonly sung. A public debate emerged after only the first Māori verse was sung at the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] match against England, and it then became conventional to sing both the Māori and English first verses one after the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/video/new-zealands-national-anthems |title= New Zealand's national anthems |publisher= Ministry of Culture and Heritage |accessdate= 31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meaning of "Pacific's triple star"'''

There is some discussion, with no official explanation, of the meaning of "Pacific's triple star". Unofficial explanations range from New Zealand's three biggest islands ([[North Island|North]], [[South Island|South]], and [[Stewart Island]]),&lt;ref name=MCH_history-god-defend/&gt; to the three stars on the flag of [[Te Kooti]] (a Māori political and religious leader of the 19th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Folksong.org.nz |title=E Ihowa atua: "Triple Star" |url=http://folksong.org.nz/e_ihowa_atua/index.html#500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Milne |first1=Jonathan |title=Our anthem 'God Defend New Zealand' is a radically subversive challenge to tradition |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-newspapers/central-north-island/sport/sport-region-6459/107108169/Our-anthem-God-Defend-New-Zealand-is-a-radically-subversive-challenge-to-tradition |accessdate=19 September 2018 |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=16 September 2018 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Note on "whakarangona"'''

The original 1878 Māori version uses "whakarangona" (to be heard), the passive form of the verb "whakarongo" (to hear). An alternate passive form of the verb, "whakarongona", first appeared as one of several errors in the Māori version when "God Defend New Zealand" was published as the national hymn in 1940. The latter form of the verb has appeared in many versions of the anthem since this time, although the Ministry of Culture and Heritage continues to use "whakarangona".&lt;ref name=MCH-anthems&gt;{{cite web |title=National anthems: God Defend New Zealand/Aotearoa |url= http://www.mch.govt.nz/nz-identity-heritage/national-anthems/god-defend-new-zealandaotearoa |date=25 March 2015 |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Both the lyrics and melody of "God Defend New Zealand" have been criticised in some quarters as being dull and irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Swarbrick" /&gt; Many of the words and concepts have been perceived as antiquated or obscure: for example, [[thou|"thy", "thee"]], "[[wikt:rampart|ramparts]]", "[[wikt:assail|assail]]", and "{{sic|nation's|expected=nations'}} [[vanguard|van]]".&lt;ref name="Swarbrick" /&gt; It was perceived as being difficult to sing at the original pitch.&lt;ref name="Fernie" /&gt;

[[File:Demotte Shahname 002.jpg|thumb|[[Bahram V|Bahram Gur]] killing a wolf, [[Harvard University Art Museum]]]]
The '''Great Mongol ''Shahnameh''''', also known as the '''Demotte ''Shahnameh''''' or '''Great Ilkhanid ''Shahnama''''',&lt;ref&gt;"Great Ilkhanid ''Shahnama''", used [http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/art/169542 by the Fogg Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; is an illustrated manuscript of the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' (also rendered "Shahnama"), the [[national epic]] of [[Greater Iran]]. It is the oldest surviving illustrated manuscript of the ''Shahnameh'', probably dating to the 1330s, and in its original form, which has not been recorded, was probably planned to consist of about 280 folios with 190 illustrations, bound in two volumes, although it is thought it was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;Carboni and Adamjee; Blair &amp; Bloom, 28&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the largest early book in the tradition of the [[Persian miniature]],&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, 155; it is slightly larger than the copies of the ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]'' or ''Compendium of Chronicles'' of a few decades earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; in which it is "the most magnificent manuscript of the fourteenth century",&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 28&lt;/ref&gt; "supremely ambitious, almost awe-inspiring",&lt;ref&gt;Sims, 277&lt;/ref&gt; and "has received almost universal acclaim for the emotional intensity, eclectic style, artistic mastery and grandeur of its illustrations".&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Demotte_Shahname_003.jpg|thumb|right|Mourning the dead Iskandar ([[Alexander the Great]]), [[Freer Gallery of Art]]]]

It was produced in the context of the [[Ilkhanate|Il-khanid]] court ruling Persia as part of the [[Mongol Empire]], about a century after their conquest, and just as the dynasty was about to collapse.  It remained in Persia until the early 20th century, when it was broken up in Europe by the dealer [[George Joseph Demotte|George Demotte]], and now exists as 57 individual pages, many significantly tampered with, in a number of collections around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miniatures==
Like other Persian manuscripts, it uses paper. Excluding blank margins, the pages are 41 by 29&amp;nbsp;cm, with the text in six columns of 31 lines where not interrupted by the miniatures. These mostly take the full width of the page, and are placed at various heights within it. None are full page. Some miniatures use irregular "stepped" shapes to suit the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 28–30&lt;/ref&gt;  Given the history of the manuscript (see below), the usual system of numbering by folios cannot be applied.

The style, technique and artistic quality of the miniatures are highly variable; it has been suggested that different artists were responsible for them, but attempts to assign the miniatures to different hands have not achieved consensus.  There seems to be experimentation in several respects.  Some miniatures are paintings in ink lines and coloured washes, others use opaque watercolour, in a range of palettes. Some [[pigment]]s have not lasted well. The miniatures have elements derived from both Chinese and (less often) Western traditions; for example the mourners of Iskandar draw from Christian depictions of the ''[[Lamentation of Christ]]'', and reminiscences of several other standard scenes from the [[Life of Christ in art]] appear in other miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, 162–165; Blair &amp; Bloom, 30; Canby, 34&lt;/ref&gt;  Even costumes are highly variable: 37 styles of hat have been found, and 8 of [[lapel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Iskandar (Alexander the Great) at the Talking Tree.jpg|thumb|Iskandar ([[Alexander the Great]]) at the Talking Tree, which foretells his death. Freer]]

From the vast range of potential moments to illustrate in the ''Shahnameh'', and even allowing for the limited proportion that have survived, the illustrations show unusual choices. The [[Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great#In the Shahnameh|story of Iskandar]], a Persianized version of [[Alexander the Great]], is very heavily illustrated, while the longer story of [[Rustam]] much less so.&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 30&lt;/ref&gt;  Themes given emphasis by the choices of what to illustrate include "the enthronement of minor kings, dynastic legitimacy, and the role of women as kingmakers", as well as scenes of murder and mourning.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 34; Titley, 22; Grove, 202&lt;/ref&gt;  These choices are usually taken as reflecting contemporary political events,&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 30; Canby, 34&lt;/ref&gt; including "tensions between the Il-khanid dynasty and Persian subjects",&lt;ref&gt;Iranica&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Black Death]], which was ravaging Persia in these years. They have been described as "often doom-laden".&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Borrowings from [[Chinese art]], in the shape of gnarled trees, round-topped wave-like rocks and tightly curling strips of cloud, dominate the landscapes and skies.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 22–24; Canby, 34&lt;/ref&gt;  In many images, large main figures dominate the composition in a way unusual in Persian miniatures, though common in the West. In Chinese art, there were large main figures, but these were not combined with [[landscape painting]], as they are here.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, 165&lt;/ref&gt;  The display of emotion by figures is also unusual;&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 216–217; Iranica&lt;/ref&gt; the convention for depicting grief is borrowed from Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, 165&lt;/ref&gt;  Kings often have halos.

As regards their shape, 29 are horizontal rectangles, 8 vertical ones, and 12 squares, giving a total of 49 rectangular images. Stepped images total nine, with 5 symmetrical and four not (so 58 in total).&lt;ref&gt;Sims, 275&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The ''Shahnameh'', an epic poem of about 60,000 couplets, was completed in 1010 by [[Ferdowsi]]. It covers the pre-Islamic history of Persia, beginning in pure legend, but by the final Sassanid kings giving a reasonable accurate historical account, mixed in with romantic stories.  It represented an assertion of Persian national identity,&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, 154&lt;/ref&gt; begun during the [[Iranian Intermezzo]] after the Arab [[Abbasid Caliphate]] had lost effective control of Persia.  By the time it was finished the [[Turkic migration|Turkic]] [[Ghaznavid]]s had taken over.  

The [[Mongol Empire]] had begun to conquer Persia in 1219, and completed it in the 1250s, founding the sub-dynasty and state known as the Ilkhanate, which as well as Persia included modern [[Iraq]] and parts of [[Afghanistan]], [[Turkey]] and several other countries (especially parts of the former [[Soviet Union]]).&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 17&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mongols initially mostly continued a nomadic lifestyle and lived separately from their Persian subjects, but increasingly settled in Persian cities and developed an understanding of [[Persianate]] culture, as well as converting to [[Islam]], which happened rapidly, at least among the elite, after the newly-converted [[Ghazan]] reached the throne in 1295.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, 135&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Mongols remained largely culturally distinct at the time the Great Mongol ''Shahnameh'' was created.
[[File:The death of the hero Rustam and his horse Rakhsh.jpg|thumb|The death of the hero [[Rustam]] and his horse [[Rakhsh]]; as he dies Rustam shoots his treacherous brother through the tree he hides behind, [[British Museum]]]]

Tiles with verses from the Shahnameh have been found in a Mongol palace, dating from about 1280. It is clear from literary references that there was a pre-Islamic tradition of illustrating stories later included in the ''Shahnameh'' in wall-paintings and probably other media,&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 22; Canby, 30&lt;/ref&gt; and some Islamic ceramics may well show such scenes.  But there are no survivals, or mentions, of illustrated books of the ''Shahnameh'' before the 14th century, and the ten surviving manuscripts from between 1300 and 1350 all appear to have been produced for Mongols.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, 150; The [[Florence Shahnameh]], the oldest text-only manuscript  to survive, dates to 1217&lt;/ref&gt;  Possibly a relative unfamiliarity with the [[Persian language]] and the text may have encouraged adding pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 30&lt;/ref&gt; 

These include three "small" ''Shahnameh''s, perhaps the earliest, whose small size (text and image area of 250 x 170 mm in a typical example) may have suited nomadic owners, and four manuscripts for the semi-independent [[Injuid]] rulers of [[Shiraz]] and [[Isfahan]] in the south-west.  This latter group, probably all later than the Great Mongol ''Shahnameh'', are influenced by it, though much less complex in style.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed at length by Sims; Grove; Canby, 34–38; Titley, 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

The books had a political purpose, which is reflected in the choice of incidents to illustrate: "in such works, the hitherto stubbornly alien rulers of Iran were expressing a new and public commitment to the religion and cultural heritage of the very lands that they themselves had devastated some two generations previously—and doing so with an urgency that suggested they were making up for lost time."&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, 137&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first decade of the 13th century the Persian Jewish [[vizier]], [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rašīd-al-Dīn]] was commissioned by Ghazan to continue a history of the Mongols, which he completed in 1307, and the next khan [[Öljaitü]] ordered a world history, the ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]'', the earliest manuscript of which also dates to 1307.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 31; Blair &amp; Bloom, 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;  Rašīd-al-Dīn set up a [[scriptorium]] in the Tabriz suburb of [[Rab'-e Rashidi]], where the book was researched, scribed, illustrated and bound.  The intention was to produce two illustrated manuscript copies each year, one in Persian and one in Arabic, for distribution around the empire; parts of three of these survive, as well as parts of other books from the workshop.  They are illustrated in a fairly consistent style, which the Great Mongol ''Shahnameh'' builds on and significantly develops.&lt;ref&gt;Grove (fullest); Canby, 31–32; Blair &amp; Bloom, 26–28; Titley, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;  After Rašīd-al-Dīn was executed in 1318 the workshop declined or ceased, but his son [[Ghiyas al-Din ibn Rashid al-Din|Ḡīāṯ-al-Dīn Moḥammad]] revived it when he rose in the court in the 1330s, and the Great Mongol ''Shahnameh'' is assumed to have been created there.&lt;ref&gt;Grove; Canby, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Any [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] with details of when the work was produced and who commissioned it, which many Persian manuscripts have, has been lost. The work has always been located to [[Tabriz]] in the late [[Ilkhanate|Il-khanid]] period, and was clearly a massive project commissioned by someone important in the court, probably with the ruler as the ultimate recipient, either through a gift or a delegated commission.  Recent studies of the manuscript have been dominated by the conclusions reached at a seminar at Harvard in 1975, published in 1980 by [[Oleg Grabar]] and [[Sheila Blair]] (see Further reading below).&lt;ref&gt;Sims, 276&lt;/ref&gt;

This proposed a short period of creation, with the start of work very precisely dated to "between November 1335 and May 1336",&lt;ref&gt;Sims, 276&lt;/ref&gt; and a commission by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rašīd-al-Dīn]]’s son [[Ghiyas al-Din ibn Rashid al-Din|Ḡīāṯ-al-Dīn Moḥammad]], with work on the manuscript probably brought to an end by his murder in May 1336.  Both these points have been generally accepted, though the lack of evidence for either has been noted, and in particular some scholars favour a period of creation stretching over a much longer period.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, 277 (see also David Morgan, p. 429-430, in the same volume); Blair &amp; Bloom, 28; Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;  The main alternative initial patron proposed has been the last of the main line of Ilkhanid rulers, [[Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan|Abu Sa'id]],&lt;ref&gt;Ekhtiar, Maryam, Sheila R. Canby, Navina Haidar, and Priscilla P. Soucek, ed., ''Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in The Metropolitan Museum of Art'', 2011, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, no. 57, pp. 89, 96–97, ill. p. 96, [http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/448938?sortBy=Relevance&amp;amp;high=on&amp;amp;ao=on&amp;amp;ft=Great+Ilkhanid+Shahnameh&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;rpp=20&amp;amp;pos=1 online at MMA, in "Catalogue entry"]&lt;/ref&gt; who died in 1335, as did his sons, all apparently of the plague, so precipitating the splitting of the Ilkhanate into small states.  If this was the case, Ḡīāṯ-al-Dīn Moḥammad might very well have still been responsible for fulfilling the commission.

The miniaturist [[Dust Muhammad]] wrote a history of Persian painting in about 1544,&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 22&lt;/ref&gt; over 200 years later, in which he refers to an important royal ''Shahnameh'', which he describes as "square" in format,&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 33&lt;/ref&gt; which the Great Mongol ''Shahnameh'' is not. Nevertheless, many scholars have thought he was describing the Great Mongol ''Shahnameh''.  Dust Muhammad traced the style of painting used in his day to a painter called Ahman Musa,&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; and described the ''Shahnameh'' as produced by a pupil of his, called Shamsuddin, for [[Shaikh Awais Jalayir]], a ruler of the [[Jalayirid]] dynasty reigning 1356–74.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 33&lt;/ref&gt;  If the period of creation was in fact protracted, this account might refer to the later stages of work.

The manuscript seems to have remained in Tabriz until the early 16th century, if not later,&lt;ref&gt;Blair &amp; Bloom, 28&lt;/ref&gt; and then at some point entered the main library of the shahs, where it was photographed in the late 19th century, still bound.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 33; Iranica:"The manuscript is thought to have belonged to the Qajar royal library, for it was photographed while still bound ... by Antoin Sevrugin, court photographer to the rulers Nāṣer-al-Dīn Shah (1264-1313/1848-96) and Moẓaffar-al-Dīn Shah (1313-24/1896-1907 ...). Moḥammad-ʿAlī Shah (1324-27/1907-09) and members of his household are said to have been selling manuscripts from the dynastic collection as early as 1908, in order to meet personal expenses."&lt;/ref&gt; It was once kept in [[Golestan Palace]] but it first appeared in Europe with [[George Joseph Demotte|Georges Demotte]], a [[Belgians|Belgian]] art dealer active from 1900–23 in Paris: "Demotte is said to have acquired the manuscript in Paris in about 1910; he bought it from Shemavan Malayan, brother-in-law of the well-known dealer [[Hagop Kevorkian]], who had brought it from [[Tehran]]".&lt;ref&gt;Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;

Demotte failed to raise the price he wanted for the whole manuscript from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and other potential buyers. He then separated the miniatures and sold them, after various physical interventions to increase the sale value, and without properly recording the original form of the book.  Pages were pulled apart to give two sides with miniatures, and to disguise this and the resulting damage, calligraphers were hired to add new text, often from the wrong part of the work, as Demotte did not expect his new clientele of wealthy collectors to be able to read Persian.&lt;ref&gt;Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;  This has left the subject of some miniatures still uncertain, as the surrounding text does not match them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/451082 "Nushirvan Eating Food Brought by the Sons of Mahbud", Folio from a Shahnama (Book of Kings)], Metropolitan Museum of Art; see commentary&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have been very critical of the "infamous" Demotte,&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 216&lt;/ref&gt; and it irked many that the manuscript he treated so brutally carried his name, so the new name of "Great Mongol ''Shahnameh''" was promoted, and has generally won acceptance.

Currently, 57 miniatures from this manuscript have been identified in museums around the world,&lt;ref&gt;Carboni and Adamjee; but Blair &amp; Bloom and Iranica say 58; apparently one was destroyed in 1937, see Sims, 274, in note&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Freer Gallery of Art]], which has the largest group at 17 pages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/edan/object.php?q=fsg_S1986.102a-d Freer/Smithsonian page]; technically some are Freer Gallery, others Sackler Gallery&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Louvre]] (2), [[British Museum]], Metropolitan Museum of Art (2), and museums in [[Dublin]] (7), [[Berlin]], [[Boston]] (2), [[Cleveland]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1943.658.b ''Bahram Gur Slays a Dragon''], [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Detroit]], [[Montreal]], and other cities, as well as private collections including the [[Khalili Collection]].

'''''Head of a Clown''''' (in French: '''''Tête de Clown''''') is a painting by Luxembourg artist [[Joseph Kutter]] from about 1937.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063622/LUX_280_005.html |title=Tête de Clown, Joseph Kutter |website=europeana.eu |language=fr |access-date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The 62.7 x 45.8&amp;nbsp;cm. picture is part of the collection of the [[National Museum of History and Art]] in Luxembourg.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt;

==Analysis==
One of the most famous artists of Luxembourg in the first half of the 20th century was [[expressionist]] Joseph Kutter. From 1927, he is one of the significant names of the Luxembourg [[Secession (art)|Secession]].
Human figures are central to his work and through them he expresses humanity and himself. He's able to combine different artistic influences of his time. Clowns appear in his works in 1935, as a result of their participation in the variety show in Luxembourg. Initially, his characters have a cheerful character , but after 1936–1937, he began to paint a series of clowns expressing worry and suffering. This was due to the painter's serious illness.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |language=fr |url=http://www.mnha.lu/en/Guided-tours/Joseph-Kutter-331 |title=Joseph Kutter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of '''Israeli printmaking''' can be found in the [[Hebrew]]-[[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] [[printing|print]] from the second half of the 19th century. The field includes the use of various print techniques such as [[woodcut]], [[etching]], [[Lithography]] and more. At the same time, the development of the artistic print in the Land of Israel and later in the State of [[Israel]] cannot be translated into a continuum of development, but rather a tradition of mutual influences along with expressions of disconnect and disregard caused by various artistic influences and by the development of technological means. 

==The beginning of printing in Palestine== 
[[file:Olitzky 02.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|''Seder Avodat Hakodes'' title page, woodcut, printed by [[Israel Back]].]]
The beginning of the modern printing industry in Israel can be found in the second half of the 19th century, when a number of printing houses were established in [[Jerusalem]]. These printing houses dealt with the printing of texts in which various artistic images were incorporated. The first [[Hebrew]] printing house was established by [[Israel Back]] (Baal Koreh [Hebrew term for Torah Reader]) in [[Safed]] in 1841 and transferred to Jerusalem in 1841. Back worked with presses and tools for casting letters he brought with him from Europe. The first press was a wooden table-shaped press, a heavy metal plate laid on the paper undergoing the printing operation.&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph Olitzky, The Art of Printing, (Hadera: Museum of Printing Art and Hadera Paper, 1973), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842, Israel Back received the printing presses nicknamed "Massat Moshe and Yehudit" (he: משאת משה ויהודית) from [[Moses Montefiore]]. Its area of print was 85 cm long and 57&amp;nbsp;cm wide.&lt;ref&gt;This press, known as the "Moses and Yehudit", was sold with the closure of the printing house by the son of Israel Beck to the "Zuckerman Printing Press" (see, Joseph Olitzky, The Art of Printing, p. 37, 53-54). From a more recent perspective, the press was transferred to the Levin-Epstein Press. Today the press is located at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya&lt;/ref&gt; The first book printed by Back in Jerusalem was "Seder Avodat Hakodes" (he: סדר עבודת הקודש) by [[Chaim Yosef David Azulai]].[3] His title page is decorated with a hybrid model created using a [[wood engraving]] technique. In the center of the description is an image of a two-column gate in the [[Ionic order]], bearing a decorative [[frieze]] with an [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaf. Around the gate, Beck created an ornamental frame with vegetal patterns.&lt;ref&gt;See Yona Fischer, ed., Art and Craft in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum,1979), p. 188-189.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Christian printing houses such as the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Armenian]] St. James Printing House, founded in 1833; the [[Custody of the Holy Land|Franciscan]] printing house, which began in 1846 under the direction of [[Sebastian Pratschner]]; the printing house of [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate]], which was founded in 1853 and another printing house, established in 1885 at the [[Schneller Orphanage]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gil Gordon, "'The best one in the Black Art: The Print-shop of Schneller's German Protestant Mission in Palestine in the late Ottoman Period'," Cathedra 138 (2010):  83-110. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The main concern of printing houses was the printing of texts using [[Letterpress printing]]. However, in the process of printing, various illustrations were sometimes included. These illustrations were created using woodcut, wood engraving or metal engraving techniques and were limited by the size the print. Most of the decorations were assigned to the title page of the book. This page usually consisted of a decorative frame created from a print or image of the [[Holy Land]]. In addition, the printing houses created a variety of printed items such as decorated certificates, "Mizrachs" [ornamental or sacred pictures hung on the east wall of a house or synagogue in the direction of Jerusalem], etc. The printing houses themselves created some of the printing blocks, while others were commissioned by independent trainers. [[Abraham Leib Monzon]], for example, created some of the printing blocks for his printing house, while others were created by artists like [[Meir Rozin]]. On the "Shiviti" plate, for example, created by [[Shimon Israel Shane]], three printing blocks (printing plates) that contain descriptions of the [[Western Wall]], [[Rachel's Tomb]] and the tombs of the kings of the House of David, with hand-painted and hand-stamped seals, were added.&lt;ref&gt;See Yona Fischer, ed., Art and Craft in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum,1979), p. 49-51.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, these illustrations were reused for various printed materials and even passed between different printing houses.&lt;ref&gt;See Yona Fischer, ed., Art and Craft in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum,1979), p.184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of the technique of lithograph printing was at the ''Salomon Printing House'' (he: דפוס סלומון), founded by [[Yoel Moshe Salomon]] and [[Michal HaCohen]], who learned the technique in [[Königsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Inspiration and Implementation: The Story of the Salomon (Zoref) Family (Jerusalem: The Ari Synagogue, 2011), p. 10- 11.&lt;/ref&gt; During their studies there HaCohen and Solomon printed a pamphlet entitled "Altar Stones," in which they detailed the process of creating a lithographic print.&lt;ref&gt;See Shoshana Halevi, The Beginning of Hebrew Printing in Eretz Israel, on the website Daat (http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/mahanaim/halevi-1.htm) (first published in Mahanayim, 1966), p. 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt; Their decision to import the technique to Israel probably stemmed from their desire to serve as an alternative to the printing house of Back, which for 20 years had held a monopoly in the field of Jewish printmaking. One of the first works printed by the new printing house was "Shoshanta" (1862), the name for a local version of a decorative ornament drawn from European traditions. Along with the descriptions, there were also photographs of places such as the [[Tomb of Absalom]], [[Tower of David]], the Western Wall, etc. 

Another printing press that was known for its artistic works was ''A.L. Monsohn Printing House'' (he: דפוס א.ל. מונזון), which began operations in 1892. The printing house began operating with a hand press and in 1894 brought an automatic machine from Europe that could produce about 1,000 pages per hour.[10] A major part of the work of this printing press was the use of the [[lithograph]] printing technique. Among other things, it created prints of up to half a sheet (50x70 cm),&lt;ref&gt;See: A.L. Monsohn Lithographic Press,1892-1992, (Jerusalem: The Ari Synagogue, 2009), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; from the works of artists such as Rozin, Moshe Ben Yitzhak Mizrachi, and others, who also began to make use of photographs created using the lithographic technique,&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., 100 Years of Printing in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs were converted to lithographs in a process that included the use of the technique of etching and transfer paper ([[Decalcomania]]).

While the people of the '[[Old Yishuv]]' perceived art as a religious art that served the [[liturgy]], at the beginning of the 20th century, art became more prevalent in modern Hebrew culture. Expressions of Judaism also began to gain national significance, following the expansion of the [[Zionist movement]] in Europe. The artists who came from Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, already experienced artists with a standing in the print industry, contributed most to the development of this medium in the Eretz Israel. Another central milestone in the development of this concept is the establishment of the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Bezalel Academy of Arts and Crafts]] in Jerusalem in 1906.

===Hermann Struck and his successors===

The most prominent Jewish artist in the European printing industry was [[Hermann Struck]], who was associated with many Expressionist artists, was even a member of the [[Vienna Secession|Sezessionstil]] in Berlin, and exhibited consistently until 1913. Along with landscapes, Struck created portraits and genre descriptions of Jewish life, particularly in Eastern Europe. He did this in a variety of print techniques such as lithograph and etching. Over the years he published several files of prints as a book, but Struck's most famous and successful book was ''Die Kunst des Radierens'' (The Art of Etching), published in Berlin in 1908 by [[Paul Kasirer]]. The book described the process of printing etchings, interspersed with illustrations by Struck. Because of the popularity of the book, which appealed to both artists and to the public as a whole, it was printed in four additional editions between 1912 and 1923. The book established Struck's fame as a leading artist in the print industry.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

[[Jacob Steinhardt]] and [[Joseph Budko]], who studied print with Struck, also dealt often with themes from the [[Shtetl]], not only as an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] depiction, as Struck did, but also as a spiritual expression. Part of the change stemmed from the influence of expressionism on these artists. For Steinhardt, for example, this effect was expressed in a theatrical atmosphere rich in pathos and grotesque expressions.&lt;ref&gt;See One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1907 and 1935, Steinhardt created about 250 etchings, but in Palestine he began to work in the [[wood cut]] ,combining [[Wood engraving]] parts, both because of his inability to produce these etchings and as an expression of the influence of the light in Palestine, which he expresses in the contrasting blacks and whites characteristic of this medium.&lt;ref&gt;See: Amishai-Meisels, Ziva, Jacob Steinhardt: Etchings and Lithographs, (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1981), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with their independent works, the two also created [[Illustration]]s in various print techniques for various Hebrew publications that were published in Europe at the time. Among these are the woodcuts that Steinhardt created for the [[Book of Jonah]] (1924) and the [[Passover]] [[Haggadah]] (Berlin: Ferdinand Auster, 1923), accompanied by a calligraphic text created by [[Franzisca Baruch]], and the lithographs created by Budko for [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]]’s And the Crooked Shall Be Made Straight (1919), as well as his prints for the 50th edition (Berlin: Hovevei Ha-Shir Ha-Ivrit, 1923) of the writings of [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}

===1906–1930: Bezalel and the art of printing===
[[File:A.0064-2 size.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bezalel Jerusalem, Lithographical Establishment, Photograph by [[Ya'acov Ben-Dov]]. Jerusalem Print Workshop collection]]
With the establishment of the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Bezalel Academy of Arts and Crafts]], [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]], one of the leading illustrators in Europe, arrived in Jerusalem. His artistic style derived from the European "[[Jugendstil]]" and his work expressed the main Zionist national outlook at the time. Lilien was also in the habit of taking photographs from which he would create his drawings and prints. Despite the fact that he lived only a short time in Jerusalem, his style influenced Bezalel's main style of design.

In 1909, a lithography department was opened at Bezalel, headed by [[Avraham Gershowitz]] (Gershuni). This department printed a limited number of artistic works, mainly by artists such as [[Shmuel Ben-David]] and [[Jacob Stark|Ya’akov (Jacob) Stark]]. However, the print quality was poor and was not suitable for producing large editions, mainly due to the technical equipment. [[Boris Schatz]] himself testified in 1917 that the school had equipment to "make experimental leaves," but that "we do not have a printing machine."&lt;ref&gt;Boris Schatz, "A Proposal to Strengthen and Distribute Craftsmanship in Jerusalem and Eretz-Israel in General," in Shilo-Cohen, Nurit, Schatz's Bezalel, (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1982), p.178.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the artistic endeavors, the department also did commercial work such as printing textbooks and other materials, such as lottery cards designed by Shmuel Haruvi.&lt;ref&gt;See: One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p. 13-15; Also: Gideon Ofrat, "Comment on the Beginning of Lithography in Eretz Israel," on the website "Gideon Ofrat’s Warehouse" ( https://gideonofrat.wordpress.com/), 7 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the lithographic work at Bezalel included realistic prints of portraits and genre descriptions, as well as a few commercial works.

In 1919 [[Israel Hirshfeld]], a student of Bezalel (1915–1917), was sent to Vienna in order to learn professionally the art of lithograph printing. Throughout his stay there, he exchanged letters with Bezalel teachers like [[Abel Penn]], Schatz, and others who asked him to purchase a press and lithographic equipment for Bezalel, despite the fact that they did not send money to him.&lt;ref&gt;His letters are in the custody of his daughters in Jerusalem. Copies of them are in the Information Center for Israeli Art. A small notebook with documentation of his studies in Vienna was donated by his daughters to the Jerusalem Print Workshop.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 Penn himself went to Vienna and purchased a press and accompanying equipment.[17]See Yigal Zalmona, The Art of Abel Pann- From Montparnasse to the Land of the Bible, (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2003), p. XIV-XV.&lt;/ref&gt; On this press, Penn printed the series of illustrations for the Bible he created. There is however some disagreement with regard to the printing technique of these works. While Penn declared he used lithographic printing, others declared that it was a type of offset, claiming that Jerusalem presses were unsuitable for use as a basis for lithographic printing.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, "Comment on the Beginnings of Offset Printing in Eretz Israel," retrieved from Gideon Ofrat’s Storeroom, http://gideonofrat.wordpress.com/, 7 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside Bezalel, in 1923 [[Ze'ev Raban]] and [[Meir Gur Arie]] established a company called "Industrial Art Studio" (he: בית עבודה לעבודות אינדוסטריאליות), within which "Graphica Press" was created, and which printed posters of a limited size and various prints in the Jugendstil style.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, "Lilien and the Tradition of the Jugendstil in ‘Bezalel’", in: On the Land: Eretz-Israel Art: Pirkei Avot, pp. 211-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Another artist who worked in the field independently was [[Jacob Eisenberg]], who printed etchings in a workshop he set up in his home in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), pp. 14-15, in particular pp. 208-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, the influence of modernist art was evident among some Bezalel students who continued their studies in Europe or were exposed to contemporary art. These were works that established an artistic opposition to the school that expressed the spirit of the period of the Tower of David. Artists such as [[Nachum Gutman]], [[Israel Paldi]] and others created expressive etchings and, particularly, woodcuts. Among these works is a series of prints called "The God Seekers" (1923; he: מבקשי אלוהים), created by [[Reuven Rubin]], and the series of prints "Jaffa" (1925) by Israel Paldi. Late recognition was given to the series "Gray Tura" (1924; he: טורא אפורה) created by [[Arieh Allweil]] in Europe, which was displayed in Israel only in the 1990s.

==1930–1950: From the Consolidation of the Nation to the consolidation of Self==
[[File:Taamon 1940's.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Miron Sima]], [[Yehuda Wolpert]], [[Isidore Aschheim]], [[Jacob Pines]], [[Yossi Stern]] and [[Mordecai Ardon]] at Cafe Ta'mon, Jerusalem, 1940s]]
In the 1930s, the printing industry began to take on greater importance in the field of Eretz Israeli art. The development of the field was closely linked to the [[Fifth Aliyah]], in which many artists came to Eretz Israel and Jerusalem. These artists, persecuted by their countries of origin in Germany and Austria, sought to continue the spirit of European modernism in general and the heritage of German art movements such as Bauhaus and Expressionism in particular.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, The New Bezalel: The Bezalel Academy of Art and Design (Jerusalem, 1987), p. 26; also: Yigal Zalmona, 100 Years of Israeli Art, Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2015), p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the art of the time reflected in many ways the construction of Zionist national consciousness. An example of this can be found in stamps issued by the [[Jewish National Fund]], quoting images drawn from artists such as Struck, Lilien, Budko, Steinhardt, and others, who reflected the worldview of the creators of the artistic print, and whose images could at that time easily pass from private to nationalistic art.&lt;ref&gt;See: We Shall not Forget You, Exile (Jerusalem, Jewish National Fund, 1945).&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening of the Tel Aviv Museum, in 1934, was accompanied by the dedication of one of the two halls of [[Tel Aviv Museum]] to works in the various print fields.&lt;ref&gt;See: "Etchings Exhibitions," Doar Hayom [Post Office Today], 28 January 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of the growing importance of the field can be found in an article published on 20 October 1935, in [[Haaretz]], entitled "The Question of Hebrew Graphics"&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, The New Bezalel: The Bezalel Academy of Art and Design (Jerusalem, 1987), p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; and the printing of a [[Dictionary]] of Graphic Arts published by [[Mordecai Narkis]] in 1937 by the [[Bialik Institute]] and the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language|Hebrew Language Committee]]. The publication of the dictionary reflected the activities of The [[Bezalel National Museum]] in the 1920s and 1930s and the need to create uniform and clear terms for the various print terms. The dictionary of Narkis, dedicated to Hermann Struck on the occasion of his 60th birthday, was based on the German language, whose terms are "most common among the graphic artists living in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Narkis, Dictionary of Graphic Terms, (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute Publishing, 1937, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of these documents reveals that the term "graphics" included both the artistic print and the graphic design field. This mixture would remain a guiding principle in the school of "New Bezalel School for Arts and Crafts" which was opened in 1935 in Jerusalem. The curriculum of the school aspired to raise the artistic level of design in Israel, while providing practical opportunities for students to earn a living. This practical approach demonstrated the fact that Hebrew industry (and, to some extent, the Hebrew city) also began to serve as another legitimate expression of Zionist activity. Therefore, the school, whose first director was Budko, did not open an art track, but rather a track for practical graphics, which was headed by [[Rudi Deutsch]] (Dayan). The department dealt mainly with lithograph printing, which was the most popular commercial technique at the time.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, The New Bezalel: The Bezalel Academy of Art and Design (Jerusalem, 1987), p. 72-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacob Steinhardt]], who immigrated to Eretz Israel in 1933 opened, in what had been the home of Boris Schatz, a painting and printing studio that was a kind of opposition to the "New Bezalel", which was directed by Yosef Budko. After Budko's death in 1940, Steinhardt joined Bezalel's staff and became director of the school's graphics department. During this period, the importance of classical printing techniques, lithography, woodcutting, and engraving as a commercial printing technique became less important, eclipsed by offset printing. However, these techniques were revived through art classes at the school.

During the 1940s a small community of artists, who engaged in graphic techniques, including artistic prints of various kinds, was established around the "New Bezalel." A comprehensive view of their works shows the strong influence of German culture on everything connected to the cultural tradition (Bildung). In the prints of these artists, such as [[Miron Sima]], [[Isidor Aschheim]], and Jakob Eisenscher, as well as in the works of artists who worked independently of this group, such as [[Arieh Allweil]], [[Paul Conrad Henich]], [[Abraham Goldberg]], [[Leo Roth]] and others, we see an attempt to combine European style with characteristics of the local Eretz Israeli reality and Zionist motifs and themes. This was often accompanied by the adoption of biographical-psychological features, which were largely missing in the works of historic Bezalel's artists.

==1950–1970: The print in the State of Israel==
[[File:Pins - Woodcuts for Heinrich von Kleist’s Michael Kohlhaas 07.jpg|thumb|right|250px|From Woodcuts for Heinrich von Kleist’s Michael Kohlhaas (1953 / 2003} by [[Jacob Pins]]. Woodcut, Printed by the Jerusalem Print Workshop]]

The establishment of the State of [[Israel]] in 1948 does not constitute a significant historical point in the history of [[Israeli art]], apart from several expressions of nationalism and the development of iconography around the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. However, the opening of [[Mandatory Palestine]] to Jewish immigration led to a large population that began to be educated according to the tradition of the young field of the Israeli print, led in these years by Jacob Steinhardt in the new Bezalel. Many of the youngsters who came to Eretz Israel after the Holocaust either under the auspices of Youth Aliyah, or with their families, such as [[Jacob Pins]], [[Avraham Ofek]], [[Avigdor Arikha]], [[Yehuda Bacon]], [[Moshe Hoffman]], among others, became prominent Israeli artists in the 1950s and 1960s.

Apart from the technique of the woodcut, that could be studied at Bezalel, there were not many places that trained artists in the various print techniques. In [[Ein Hod]] and Jerusalem, [[Rudi Lehman]] taught the art of the wood cut and sculpture. A large group of artists were influenced by his approach to art, that combined animal images in a "primitive" style with a modernist ethos of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel C p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; This group included artists such as [[Shoshana Heimann]], [[Raya Bar Ado]]n and others.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Some training in the technique of lithograph printing was provided by Cohen, who operated the Hebrew University Press in Jerusalem. Most of the artists printed their works in his studio, or with local artists, such as [[David Ben Shaul]], who had specialized in lithograph printing in Paris. Upon his return to Israel in 1963, he brought a lithographic press and printed works for various artists in his studio in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;See: Arik Kilmanik, "Setting Up a Print Workshop", in: The Printer’s Imprint: Twenty Years of the Jerusalem Print Workshop (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1994), p. 9; also: "A Conversation with Arik Kilmanik", in: Prints from the Collection of the Jerusalem Print Workshop (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 1984), p. 4 (no page numbers).&lt;/ref&gt;

Basing themselves on the local tradition and ethos of Paris as the capital of world art,&lt;ref&gt;See: Benjamin Tammuz, "They Returned from Paris," Ha'aretz, 17 December 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; many artists continued to travel to pursue art studies in France and Europe, unaware of the change in the world art scene and the development of the United States as an art center.&lt;ref&gt;While in the United States offset printing in the 1950s and 1960s became the main printing technique, the use of this technique in industry began only in the late 1950s. According to Eric Kilmanik, one of the first to engage in non- industrial printing was the daughter or granddaughter of Martin Buber, who set up an offset printing workshop in her home, where Kilmanik created a poster for a folk dance evening at the Bezalel Student Union.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aryeh Rothman]], for example, went to study at the [[Académie Julian]] in 1959, and later studied in Paris at the [[Johnny Friedlaender]] engraving workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Angel, "The Engravings of Johnny Friedlander," Maariv, 28 May 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tuvia Beeri]] studied at the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] (1963–1961), and continued his specialization in Friedlaender's engraving workshop. [[Milka Cizik]], however, went to study in [[East Germany]] (1965–1961), where she studied various printing techniques at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]].

The French and German influences led to the adoption of modernist techniques,&lt;ref&gt;Newer techniques, which would come to be identified with postmodernism, began to enter the industry in Israel in the late 1950s. In Israel, for example, a silk printing was used. See: "Institute for the Preparation of Professional Study Materials is Established,"Sha’arim, 24 December 1956; And also: "The World of Printing," Davar, 24 September 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; such as Aryeh Rothman's use of the photographic technique of [[Heliograveur]]&lt;ref&gt;The Heliograveur is a form of photogravure that dates back to the 19th century and is used to reproduce photographs.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "invention" by others of various artistic techniques (in the spirit of late [[Surrealism]]). [[Miron Sima]], for example, added to his woodcuts, such as "The Bride", textures printed from fabrics and chains, which sought to enrich the texture of the print, and to deepen its realism. In addition, the shortage of materials available in Israel led many artists to use other techniques that were available to them, such as [[Linocut]], as a substitute for [[wood cut]]. Even Rudi Lehmann, despite his strong connection to artistic tradition, experimented with the use of new materials. He was one of the first artists to create woodcuts on [[plywood]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel C p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic print field to which these students were exposed upon their return to Israel was very limited. Not only were there no places to print editions of artistic prints, it was also considered a secondary art. In the 1960 album ''Graphic Art in Israel'', [[Eugen Kolb]] wrote that "exhibitions of graphics only are considered (unfairly!) for less important exhibits."&lt;ref&gt;Zvi Zohar and Eugen Kolb, The Israeli Graphic, (Ha-Kibbutz Artzi, Merhavia: Sifriat Poalim, 1960), p. 9. Another textual review of the Israeli print and drawing artists appeared in the book The Art of Israel (Jerusalem: Massada, 1963) by Benjamin Tammuz.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisheva Cohen]], curator of the Department of Prints and Drawings at the [[Bezalel National Museum]] and at the [[Israel Museum]], had to publish the booklet T''he Print: What Is It?'' (1965),&lt;ref&gt;What is a Print? (Jerusalem:The Israel Museum,1965).&lt;/ref&gt; in order to expose the field to visitors to the museum. Therefore, it is no wonder that in the annual general exhibition of the ''Israel Painters and Sculptors Association'' of 1963, for example, only 7 artistic prints were displayed out of 375 works.&lt;ref&gt;Among the exhibitors were Hedwig Grossman (1), Hanna Pfizer (1), Jacob Pins (2), Arieh Rothman (2) and Shoshana Resnick (1). See: General Exhibition of Israeli Artists 1963 (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Also at the exhibition ''Tazpit'' 1964, which was perceived as more artistic at the time, Tuvia Beeri was the only artist among more than 30 artists who exhibited prints.&lt;ref&gt;See: Tatspit [Observation Point] (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1964). Tazpit - an acronym for an Israeli painting and sculpture exhibition - was an exhibition organized by a group of artists who wanted to create an exhibition of  young art that was free of institutional pressures. In this exhibition, artists who chose to work in the area of prints in those years, such as Yigal Tumarkin and Uri Lifshitz, participated, but the exhibition chose to present works in a more avant-garde style: On the subject of this exhibition, see: Galia BarOr and Hayuta Bahat: Paintings (Ein Harod: Museum of Art, 2013), pp. 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at the same time the print was perceived in various circles as an expression of "good taste." An example of this can be found in the publications of [[Moshe Spitzer]], who commissioned illustrations for publications by Tarshish Publishing House that were done using various print techniques. Among these works are [[Avigdor Luisada]]'s woodcuts for [[Yitzhak Shenhar]]’s ''Between Star and Grass'' (1942) and the engravings of [[Avigdor Arikha]] for ''A Stray Dog'' (1958) and the woodcuts created by [[Jacob Pines]] for the book [[Michael Kohlhaas]] (1953).&lt;ref&gt;However, the latter two were not printed directly from the printing board, but were transferred to print using a photographic method, which was more suitable for larger editions. See: Ada Vardi, Spitzer: Chapters and Tarshish (Tel Aviv: Tarshish Publishing, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the printing workshop of the Artists House Tel Aviv opened under the auspices of the Israel Painters and Sculptors Association and was managed by Tuvia Beeri. The workshop gave artists for the first time a place of work to create works using engraving techniques. At the same time, Beeri opened another workshop at the [[Avni Institute of Art and Design|Avni Institute]].

==1970-1990: Between avant-garde and institutionalization ==

During the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]], the printing industry underwent a period of unprecedented development in Israel. A variety of print workshops made it possible for artists to create works using various techniques in this medium. A number of artists began to work in prints and in preparing printing plates for other artists in their studio. Moshe Givati established a printing workshop in Haifa that dealt mainly with screen printing technique.&lt;ref&gt;Between 1970 and 1971, Givati worked at a silk-printing workshop at his studio in Haifa, where he created works in the wake of Yitzhak Danziger's "Nesher Quarry" project. In addition, he printed works for artists such as Michael Gross, Shmuel Katz, Zvi Mairovitch and others. From 1974 to 1982 he lived in New York, where he made a living by working in real estate, alongside his work as an artist in a workshop he opened with Arieh Moscovitch.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Ben Shaul|David (Dedi) Ben Shaul]], printed using lithograph technique, and [[Avishai Eyal]], who worked primarily in the medium of etching, set up a separate studio in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Eyal was mainly engaged in experimental printing and in printing prints in small editions. See: Sanford Sivits Shaiman, Prints from the Avishay Ayal Etching workshop 1972-1975 (Haifa: University of Haifa, 1990); Gideon Ophrat, 100 Years of Print Art in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the establishment of the large workshops made the independent activities of these artists somewhat redundant.  Itche Mambush founded another workshop in the 1960s in Ein Hod, directed by [[Ora Lahav Shaltiel]]. In 1972 [[Jacob Harel]] founded a commercial print workshop that would become Har-el Printers and Publishers. In 1974 the [[Jerusalem Print Workshop]] was established in Jerusalem. The workshop was established as a public benefit company and was initially associated with the [[Jerusalem Artists Association]]. In 1975, the [[Israel Museum]] set up another public print workshop - the Burston Graphics Center - in [[Hutzot Hayotzer]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Meira Perry-Lehman, Curator, Israeli prints from the Burston Gallery, (Jerusalem:The Israel Museum, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several other printing houses published in the field of  artistic printing.&lt;ref&gt;See: Rachel Angel, "The Register - in Seventy Languages," Maariv, 16 January 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the rising popularity of the medium could be found in the activity of the Israeli Graphotek, which in [[1978]] had not yet opened its doors to the public, but had already collected about 1300 works by 105 different artists.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Angel, "The Israeli Graphotec," Maariv, 2 March 1979&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[1990s]], Graphotek had already collected about 4,000 works by about 200 artists and was accessible to the public in six centers around the country.&lt;ref&gt;See: The Graphotec Notebook, Alima File (Jerusalem: The Information Center for Israeli Art, The Israel Museum).&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1975 list, [[Adam Baruch]] described the growing popularity of artistic prints during those years in Israel and around the world. Baruch distinguished between the reproduction of old works to the medium of the print, and works of art that made critical use of the various techniques of the medium.&lt;ref&gt;See: Adam Baruch, "The Israeli Print (Cut)" Musag [Concept], Issue No. 5, (October 1975), p 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, attempts were made to mount systematic displays of prints. In 1978, the exhibition "30 Israeli Artists: Artistic Prints" was presented at [[Tel Aviv University]],&lt;ref&gt;See: Talia Rappaport, "50 years of prints," Davar, 23 June 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 1980s, attempts were made to establish a triennale for graphics at the Haifa Museum of Art. 

Many artists adopted the medium as another technique in their work, a technique of a more commercial nature. Usually prints were produced in editions of between 30 to 150 copies.&lt;ref&gt;The number of copies of the edition is dependent on technique. Silk prints or lithographs were printed in large editions. In some cases, about 250-300 copies were printed.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the works were intended for the international market, especially for the United States. In addition, various albums were also produced that combined 5-10 works by a single artist&lt;ref&gt;Igael Tumarkin , for example, who has created over 300 different prints, published several bound albums, including "Paraphrases on the Polyhedron" (1972), " Self Portrait 1975 " (1975) and " Battle of the Blind Men and the Sow- Heinrich von Kleist "(1979).&lt;/ref&gt; or by a group of artists.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Print Workshop , for example, printed in 1977 an album entitled "Jerusalem", with the prints of five artists ( Michael Gross ,Liliane Klapisch , Moshe Kupferman , Ivan Schwebel and Menashe Kadishman ), in an edition of 200 copies.&lt;/ref&gt; This commercial development led several galleries to continuously produce series of prints for artists, which were printed in the various workshops. The major ones included the Bineth Gallery in Tel Aviv&lt;ref&gt;Produced prints for artists such as Lillian Clapisch , Fima and others&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Engel Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;Produced prints for artists such as Moshe Castel and Anna Ticho and others&lt;/ref&gt; in Jerusalem. The popularity of the print also led to the printing of signed and numbered posters by artists or the production of prints based on the works of deceased artists, by inscribing their signature on the plate.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gad Ullman, "Gray Market Prints: Original Prints, Reproduction, and Everything in-between", Studio, Art Magazine, Issue No. 12 (June 1990), pp 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Unlike most of the artists who worked in the field, in the 1970s and 1980s, a group of artists continued their avant-garde activities concerning everything related to the examination of the artistic object, including in the medium of print. Artists such as [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Michael Gitlin]], [[Benni Efrat]], and others emphasized the plastic nature of the paper by using various artistic means such as repetition and seriality, or by emphasizing the print plate as an object, or by folding and distorting the paper. [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]], for example, made use of plates printed on entire sheets of paper in [[1980]], leaving him with negatives. In the works of [[Menashe Kadishman]] (1983), the artist reconstructed his sculptural activities and converted them into the print media, creating a confrontation between nature and culture.&lt;ref&gt;See: Mordechai Omer, Tikkun (Tel Aviv: The Genia Schreiber University Art Gallery,1998), p 182. Also: Gideon Ofrat, 100 Years of Printmaking in Israel , Jerusalem Print Workshop, Jerusalem, 2015 , pp. 187-186.&lt;/ref&gt; A unique preoccupation with the surface of the print is also found in the works of [[Joyce Schmidt]], who created prints using techniques of stress. Her paper-making business led her to make use of the paper produced by the business. 

From a technical point of view, the flourishing of lithography technique particularly stands out during this period. The main development of the technique in Israel during this period can be credited to the work of the Burston Graphic Center, which in its first year trained artists in this technique. [[Alima]], who studied this technique at Burston, imported this printing technique to the print workshop at the Artists House in Tel Aviv and the College of Visual Arts in Beersheva. In her independent work she combined the technique of lithography with other techniques such as screen printing and etching. To a great extent, this technique died out in the early 1990s, with the closure of the Burston Center. 

In contrast to the lithography and etching techniques, the screen printing technique (or "silkscreen printing" as it was called at the time) was perceived as a secondary technique, mainly because it lacked any artistic tradition. Art in Israel began using industrial techniques in the late 1950s, but until the 1970s it was not widely used in art. As early as 1949, [[Ellie Gross]] (Yaari) lectured on serigraphy (screen printing) in the exhibition "What is Graphics?" In the Jerusalem Artists House. However, an early example of artistic use of the medium can be found in the book The Jerusalem Hills and all the Anguish (1967) by Malachi Beit-Arie published by Tarshish. The book was accompanied by screen prints created by Myriam Bat-Yosef and printed in a commercial printing press - "Herut Herut Printing Press".&lt;ref&gt;Ada Vardi, Spitzer: Chapters and Tarshish (Tel Aviv: Tarshish Publishing, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant development in the use of art technique can be attributed to [[Zvi Tolkovsky]], who returned from art studies in the United States and learned the technique there. At the end of the sixties,Tolkovsky returned to Israel and, in 1969-1969, a workshop for printing and screen printing at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]].&lt;ref&gt;It should be noted that despite the influence of American art, the photograph was not perceived at the time as an independent artistic object, but mainly used as documentation of artistic activity.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkovsky also taught at the Artists House in Tel Aviv, where screen printing was used as part of a variety of techniques such as calligraphy. An expression of the ambivalent status of the screen print can be found in the work of [[Moshe Gershuni]], who was commissioned to create a series of print works at the Jerusalem Print Workshop in 1984.  Gershuni testified that he had a distaste for the print medium, "especially for screen printing, which in my opinion represented the most extreme form of graphic art."&lt;ref&gt;Larry Abramson,, "A Conversation with Gershuni, " in Gershuni in the Jerusalem Print Workshop (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 1984, unnumbered pages.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his works in this technique, including "Avinu Malkeinu" [Our Father,Our King] (1984), "Justice and Charity" (1984), and others, enjoyed both artistic and commercial success. 

However, the bulk of the prints were done using various etching techniques. These works were figurative in character and expressive in language. The works of artists such as [[Raanan Levy]], [[Ofer Lellouche]], [[Tamara Rickman]], David Ben-Shaul, were drawings, created using traditional techniques as etching and aquatint. In addition, there were also artists who incorporated new techniques in their works, such as [[Uri Lifschitz]], who combined in works such as "Mr. Rabinovich" (1968), etching with photographic etching. [[Yigal Tumarkin]], for example, in the print "Pieta, Pierre Paolo Pasolini," (1979). 

combined several print plates made using the technique of photographic etching, on which he combined drawing and dry etching.  The plates were combined in a collage, cut and twisted to give them an expressive character and to create negative spaces in the composition. Artists such as [[Ivan Schwebel]], [[Asaph Ben Menachem]] and [[Avraham Eilat]], used this expressionism as an expression of symbolism or metaphysical content. In the famous series "[[Kaddish]]" (1984), for example, Moshe Gershuni created a tangle of symbols and images that expressed a complex position toward Judaism and the Jewish God.  
===1990-2010=== 
[[File:Abramson T.2339.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rose of Jericho (2003) by [[Larry Abramson]]. Soft-ground and spit-bite. Printed by the Jerusalem Print Workshop]]
In the early 1990s, "new media art" began to develop, using visual images created by "technical reproduction"&lt;ref&gt;Digital media accompanied by a theoretical study which adopted the essay of Walter Benjamin "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction " (1936-1938) as a fundamental theoretical text.&lt;/ref&gt; without the need to use a manual process of creating print plates and manual printing. The use of computer graphics and digital media, which developed during this period, completely replaced manual design. The use of these methods also led to the perception of the art print industry as archaic. This led to the closure and reduction of many print workshops during the 2000s. Among other things, the workshops of the Faculty of Arts - Hamidrasha at Beit Berl College were closed, and Bezalel's work was greatly reduced. 

The activities of professional workshops were also reduced, and they stopped producing works in large editions and went on to print works in editions of only 12-18 copies. The Burston Center workshop was closed in 1990 after management problems, while the Printmaking Workshop of Tel Aviv Artists House converted its services from printing whole editions to making available the possibility of independent activity and instruction in the use of various techniques. Most of institutionalized artistic activity took place at the Gottesman Etching Center, which was established at Kibbutz Cabri in 1993, at the Har-El Printers &amp; Publishers print workshop in Tel Aviv-Jaffa and at the Jerusalem Print Workshop, which experienced a period of prosperity as a result of the workshop's activity, when it moved to a new business and artistic model in the mid-1980s. 

The shrinking of the field led most of the major artists who worked in the print industry, such as [[Ofer Lellouche]], [[Larry Abramson]], [[Sharon Poliakine]], [[Asaf Ben Zvi]], [[Hila Lulu Lin]] and others, to perceive the medium as secondary in their work. However, artists such as [[Orit Hofshi]], Asaph Ben-Menahem and others have made it the primary medium in their work. 

An area that began to develop during this period is the production of "artists’ books" - books that combined text - mostly poems - with prints created specifically for this book. Such books replaced folders of prints that artists had previously published as a portfolio. The books were printed in limited editions and numbered in etching or screen printing techniques. As early as the 1980s, the Jerusalem Print Workshop began printing such books. Among the best known are Thirteen Etchings for Poems by [[Haim Nachman Bialik]] (1987) by Moshe Gershuni, and in 1989 the workshop created a series of 9 artists’ books in an edition of 40 copies each.&lt;ref&gt;See: Etchings of Songs: Nine Files of Etchings and Poems , on the Jerusalem Print Workshop site.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of producing such books, most of the works were printed for renowned artists.&lt;ref&gt;The works of the artist include Kaddish (Jaffa: Har-El Printers and Publishers, 1997) by Moshe Gershuni , Death Fugue by Paul Celan (Jaffa: Har-El Printers and Publishers, 1995)) by Yigal Tumarkin (and other works he created in this workshop), the folder of prints of Ofer Lellouche from the Gottesman Etching Center, and "TheTrue Rose of Jericho" (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2003) by Larry Abramson .&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Israeli museums continued to purchase prints, exhibitions in major galleries in Tel Aviv-Jaffa or museum exhibitions of Israeli prints were unusual, and even the inclusion of prints in group thematic exhibitions was very small. In 1994, the Israel Museum mounted the exhibition,The Printer's Imprint: Twenty Years with the Jerusalem Print Workshop, Jerusalem, marking the 20th anniversary of the Jerusalem Print Workshop. Among the other museum exhibitions are Portfolios from the Gottesman Etching Center, Kibbutz Cabri (2006) at the Israel Museum, Etchings (2006) at the Negev Museum of Art and Print Time, Works from the Jerusalem Workshop and the Gottesman Center (2013) at the Open Museum, Tefen.

== History ==
Otto Josten founded the company as a watch-repair business in Owatonna in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Jostens looks into expanding operations in Owatonna| url = http://www.southernminn.com/owatonna_peoples_press/news/article_f7fecb83-2a09-584b-8b56-2529d2bfd81c.html|date = 18 April 2014|accessdate = 18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jostens (then called "Josten's" — the apostrophe was later dropped) began manufacturing emblems and awards for nearby schools and in 1906, the year of incorporation, Josten added class rings to his product line, to be sold to schools throughout the Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/jostens-inc-history/|title=History of Jostens, Inc. – FundingUniverse|website=www.fundinguniverse.com|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 14, 2015, [[Jarden]] announced that it would acquire Jostens for $1.5 billion, stating that it planned to take advantage of synergies with its other properties (particularly [[Rawlings (company)|Rawlings]] and [[Yankee Candle]]), and "turn it into a true consumer-product business, as opposed to it historically being run like a printing asset".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Picker| first = Leslie| title = Jarden Reaches Deal to Buy Jostens for $1.5 Billion| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2015-10-25| date = 2015-10-14| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/business/dealbook/jarden-reaches-deal-to-buy-jostens-for-1-5-billion.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg-jardenjostens&gt;{{cite news|title=Jarden to Buy Yearbook Maker Jostens for About $1.5 Billion|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-14/jarden-to-acquire-yearbook-maker-jostens-for-about-1-5-billion|accessdate=14 December 2015|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After being acquired by Jarden in 2015, Jarden merged with Newell Rubbermaid in 2016 to form [[Newell Brands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/213690/newell-nwl-closes-jarden-merger-creates-newell-brands|title=Newell (NWL) Closes Jarden Merger, Creates Newell Brands|last=Research|first=Zacks Investment|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Newell Brands sold Jostens to Platinum Equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Newell Brands Announces Agreements to Sell Pure Fishing to Sycamore Partners and Jostens to Platinum Equity| accessdate = 2018-11-25| url = http://ir.newellbrands.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Newell-Brands-Announces-Agreements-to-Sell-Pure-Fishing-to-Sycamore-Partners-and-Jostens-to-Platinum-Equity/default.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3517">'''Komafest''' (Norwegian: Coma party) was an [[urban art]] and [[graffiti]] event organized in [[Vardø]], Norway. Tens of mostly abandoned buildings were decorated by international artists in the period 5–21 July 2012, culminating in a grand opening and a guided town tour attended by hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnmarken.no/lokale_nyheter/article6159982.ece] Finnmarken: Fiskerens gudinne ble til kunst&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was curated by noted Norwegian urban artist "[[Pøbel]]". Participating artists were [[Steve Powers (artist)|Stephen Powers]] (United States), "[[Vhils]]" ([[Portugal]]), "[[ROA (artist)|Roa]]" (Belgium), Atle Østrem (Norway), "Ethos" ([[Brazil]]), "E. B. Itso", "Husk mit navn" (both Denmark), "Horfe", Ken Sortais, "Remed" (all France) and Conor Harrington (Ireland).

==Background==

Vardø is Norway's north-easternmost town. Traditionally a vibrant fishing community, the town's population halved between the 1960s and 2000s. As per 2012, depopulation had balanced out and Vardø had 2,122 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssb.no/emner/02/02/folkendrhist/tabeller/tab/2002.html] Statistics Norway (''Statistisk sentralbyrå'')&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the population decline, Vardø was left with many empty buildings in various stages of disrepair. "Pøbel" wanted to organize a larger scale continuation of the "Getto spedalsk" ("Ghetto leperous") project, where he and collaborator "[[DOLK (artist)|Dolk]]" painted abandoned buildings in at the [[Lofoten islands]].

After securing the cooperation of local developers in spring 2012, the project started getting permission from individual property owners to decorate buildings. The name "Komafest" plays on the notion of the houses being roused from their sleep by the activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnmarken.no/lokale_nyheter/article6124905.ece] Finnmarken: Tar street art til verdens ende&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Moving bus Vardø komafest.jpg|thumb|right|Vardø mayor Lasse Haughom ([[Progress Party (Norway)|FRP)]] beside the moving-bus installation]] --&gt;

==The festival==

Although substantial financing had been secured from, among others, the Northern Norway Artists' Centre, much of the daily activity relied on volunteer work and free use of privately owned heavy equipment, including lifts and cranes. "Pøbel" himself insisted the festival was as much about the locals and the town as it was the art, saying he hoped that the festival would be a catalyst for renovation and increased enthusiasm for local history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/troms_og_finnmark/1.8241059] NRK: I denne byen har Pøbel frie tøyler&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, the 100-year-old municipal cinema, closed for over 20 years and used as a warehouse, was cleared and used to host a lecture by author Tristan Manco and screen street art films.

After the opening weekend, the festival secured financing, equipment and political permission to realise the long-planned idea of planting an old bus next to the underwater tunnel that leads to Vardø. The bus was previously used to transport families and their belongings out of Vardø during the era of mass de-population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnmarken.no/kulturliv/article6164378.ece] Finnmarken: Setter punktum for Vardøs fraflytting&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes called the '''fall of the limes'''.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Wells, Peter S., ''How Ancient Europeans Saw the World'', Princeton: PUP, 2012. p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of a series of informative archaeological finds and the re-evaluation of literary sources, the ''Limesfall'' no longer appears to have been a simple historical event, but a multi-layered, complex phenomenon whose historical linkages have not yet been fully understood. Because written sources are largely absent or of dubious reliability, research often relies on archaeological findings, which can be interpreted differently.

In the past, the monocausal assumption was that the Romans had been forced by armed events and external aggressors in the context of the so-called [[Alamanni]]c Storm to withdraw from the area east of the Rhine and north of the Danube. Archaeological finds, however, suggest that this process was the result of years of development during the so-called [[Imperial Crisis of the 3rd century]] with a decline of the border provinces; and even civil wars within the Empire seem to have played a role. All this finally led in 259/260 to the ''de facto'' abandonment of the so-called [[Agri Decumates]] territory and the withdrawal of the Roman military border to the Rhine and the Danube.&lt;ref name="nuber450"&gt;Hans Ulrich Nuber: ''Staatskrise im 3.

The '''Lothair Crystal''' (also known as the '''Lothar Crystal''' or the '''Susanna Crystal''') is an [[engraved gem]] from [[Lotharingia]] in North-West Europe, showing scenes of the [[Bible|biblical]] story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], dating from 855-869.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_lothar,_or_susanna_crystal.aspx |title=Lothair Crystal |author=British Museum |date= |work=[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]] |accessdate=4 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120100557/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_lothar,_or_susanna_crystal.aspx |archivedate=20 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lothair Crystal is an object in the collection of the [[British Museum]].

==Description==
The original element of the work is a circular disc of clear [[quartz]] ("rock crystal"), measuring {{convert|11.5|cm|in}} in diameter.  This is engraved in [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] with eight scenes depicting the story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]] and the Elders, related in the [[Book of Daniel]] (but regarded as part of the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] by Protestants).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men and Centuries of European Civilization|author1=Brown, Louise Fargo|author2=Carson, George Barr|page=127b|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=978-0-8369-2100-7|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susanna is first shown being falsely accused and condemned for adultery by the elders. [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] intervenes to question the elders, uncovers their false witness and engineers their execution by stoning. In the final scene, Susanna is declared to be innocent. The scenes are accompanied by brief [[titulus (inscription)|inscriptions]] in [[Latin language|Latin]] drawn from the [[Vulgate|Vulgate Bible]].&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BM catalogue" /&gt;

The engravings on the crystal are executed in the energetic and distinctive early mediæval Rheims style which originated in [[manuscript]] drawings such as those in the [[Utrecht Psalter]].&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; The crystal is surrounded by a 15th-century gilt-copper mount with a foliage border,&lt;ref name="BM catalogue" /&gt; which was once attributed to [[Saint Eligius]] (c. 588 – 660), the [[patron saint]] of [[goldsmith]]s.&lt;ref name="Oxford-Western Art" /&gt;

==Dating==
The crystal is inscribed ''LOTHARIVS REX FRANCORVM IVSSIT'' ("Lothair, King of the [[Franks]], caused [this to be made]"&lt;ref name="ahotw_episode"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lothair Crystal|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/4jY66b8hQumUbeudll4R_w|work=A History of the World|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), apparently [[Lothair II]], or "Lothar" in German.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; The elder Lothair styled himself ''[[imperator]]'' (emperor), whereas the younger man only called himself ''rex'' (king), as does the owner of the crystal; it is therefore probable that it was created in Lothair II's time, probably around the middle of the 9th century, making it a late example of [[Carolingian art]].&lt;ref name="BM catalogue" /&gt;

==History==
Nothing is known of the history of the Lothair Crystal prior to the 10th century. Around this time, it was pawned between a [[count]] and a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Rheims]] in exchange for a horse. The canon then denied possession of the crystal.&lt;ref name="francis"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Treasures of the British Museum|year=1971|publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]]|isbn=0-500-20119-6|editor=[[Frank Francis|Francis, Sir Frank]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later discovered to be in his possession when the canon was smoked out of the cathedral when it was set alight.  In [[penance]], he founded [[Waulsort Abbey]] (in modern [[Belgium]]), where the crystal was held until the 18th century. During part of this period, it was utilised by the abbots to fasten their [[cope]]s during mass.

In 1793, [[French Revolution|revolutionary French]] forces sacked Waulsort and threw the crystal into the [[Meuse]] river, reputedly cracking it in the process.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; In the 19th century it was stolen and stripped of its jewels.&lt;ref name="francis" /&gt;  It reappeared in the hands of a Belgian dealer, who claimed it had been retrieved from the river bed and sold it to a French collector for twelve [[franc]]s. It passed to the British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician [[Ralph Bernal]], who paid [[Pound sterling|£]]10 for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=William Morris and the Middle Ages: a collection of essays, together with a catalogue of works exhibited at the Whitworth Art Gallery, 28 September-8 December 1984|pages=65–66|author1=Banham, Joanna|author2=Harris, Jennifer|isbn=978-0-7190-1721-6|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855 it was acquired by [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]] on behalf of the British Museum in an auction of Bernal's collection at [[Christie's]] for £267.&lt;ref name="BM catalogue"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=59031&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=lothair+crystal&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1|title=The Lothair Crystal|author=British Museum|work=British Museum catalogue|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Franks, Augustus Wollaston."

The Lothair Crystal was Object 53 in the 2010 [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]'', chosen and presented by the Director of the British Museum, [[Neil MacGregor]].

==Interpretation==
[[File:Lothair Crystal detail.gif|thumb|300px|Enhanced image of the engraving.]]
The crystal is one of a small number of Carolingian engraved gems created for the circles around the court, although its form does not closely resemble any of the others.  A gem with Lothair's portrait that was probably his personal seal was set a hundred years after his death into the processional [[Cross of Lothair]] in [[Aachen Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, Peter, ''Ars Sacra, 800-1200'', Yale University Press, 1995 (2nd edn.) {{ISBN|978-0300060485}}; [http://farm1.static.flickr.com/92/214980020_e621f556a1.jpg Image]&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of interpretations have been advanced for the crystal's function as well as its meaning and significance to the Lotharingian court; its meaning is unclear and it has been the subject of ongoing controversy among scholars.&lt;ref name="Ness"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early medieval art|last=Nees|first=Lawrence|pages=239–41|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-19-284243-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject matter of the crystal suggests that it was meant to be shown at court as a symbol of the king's role in the dispensation of justice.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; Its design may be an allusion to the breastplate of justice worn by the [[Kohen Gadol]] (the Jewish High Priest).&lt;ref name="Oxford-Western Art"&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Kemp, Martin|title=The Oxford history of Western art|publisher=Oxford University Press US|page=94|year=2000|isbn=978-0-19-860012-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this interpretation, the crystal may have been an attempt to show visually the ruler's responsibility to provide justice, using a biblical parallel to exhort him to uphold the ideal of wise rule exemplified by the just kings of the Old Testament. Alternatively, the subject of the crystal symbolises an idealised relationship between Church and state, with Susanna representing the Church being protected from her enemies by the just decisions of the ruler.&lt;ref name="Ness" /&gt;

[[Valerie Flint]] has argued that the crystal is related to the acrimonious divorce of Lothair and his wife Theutberga, whom he accused of committing [[incest]] and practicing [[abortion]]. It depicts the vindication of a wife falsely accused of a sexual crime, and the type of rock crystal from which it is made was used by the [[Franks]] as an amulet. Flint suggests that the crystal was designed in 865, when Lothar had a temporary reconciliation with his wife, to serve both as a reproach to the king for his conduct and as a charm to protect the royal couple against evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rider|first=Caroline|title=Magic and impotence in the Middle Ages|page=35|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-19-928222-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Northeaster''''' is one of several paintings on marine subjects by the late-19th-century American painter [[Winslow Homer]]. Like ''[[The Fog Warning]]'' and ''[[Breezing Up]]'', he created it during his time in [[Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Winslow_Homer.aspx |title=Winslow Homer |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Biography |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|The Gale Group Inc.]] |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on display in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.

==Background and description==
After extensive travel, Homer settled in [[Prouts Neck]], Maine. He had a studio built for him, which was completed in 1884, and painted marine subjects, including the hard lives of the fishermen and their families. He increasingly chose to depict the sea itself, and was especially attracted to stormy seas. During this period he painted a wide array of seascapes such as ''The Gulf Stream'' (1899), ''Moonlight&amp;nbsp;– Wood's Island Light'' (1886), ''Northeaster'' (1895) and ''Early Morning After a Storm at Sea'' (1902). Many of his paintings depict the battlefront of the sea and the shore, and the waves crashing onto the rocky shore. It has been said that they "are among the strongest expressions in all art of the power and dangerous beauty of the sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www1.umassd.edu/specialprograms/mawh/librarydocs/2goodrichessay.pdf |author=Goodrich, Lloyd |title=Winslow Homer |publisher=George Braziller, Inc. |year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Northeaster'' shows the waves while the [[Northeaster]] blows. Northeasters are storms along the upper East Coast of the United States that derive their name from the direction of the wind as it rotates onto land. The painting dates from 1895, but Homer reworked it by 1901.&lt;ref name=Met&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/11130 |title=Northeaster |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoover Giese |first=Lucretia |date=2005 |title=Meeting the New Century: Winslow Homer's Drawing after Northeaster |journal=Visual Resources |volume=21 |pages=347-362 |doi=10.1080/01973760500298146 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233201256_Meeting_the_New_Century_Winslow_Homer's_Drawing_after_Northeaster |via=[[ResearchGate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
''Northeaster'' was at [[Knoedler|M. Knoedler and Company]] of New York in 1895 and then in 1895–96 with [[Thomas B. Clarke]], also in New York. It was then returned to Homer in Maine. In 1900 it was again with Knoedler. From 1901 to 1910 it was owned by George A. Hearn, also of New York, who gave it to the Metropolitan Museum.&lt;ref name=Met/&gt;

&lt;!--... Attention:  THIS IS AN OUTLINE

        part of the set of 740+ outlines listed at
             [[Portal:Contents/Outlines]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to dance:

[[Dance]] &amp;ndash; human movement either used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]] or presented in a [[social environment|social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting. [[Choreography]] is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]] and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]]. A great many dances and dance styles are performed to [[dance music]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==What ''type'' of thing is dance?==
Dance (also called "dancing") can be described as all of the following:

* an activity or [[Human behavior|behavior]]
** one of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; a creative endeavor or discipline.
*** one of the [[performing arts]] &amp;ndash; art performed for an audience and existing in time rather than as a permanent object.
** [[Hobby]] &amp;ndash; regular activity or interest that is undertaken for pleasure, typically done during one's leisure time.
** [[Physical exercise|Exercise]] &amp;ndash; bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.
** [[Recreation]] &amp;ndash; leisure time activity
* [[motion (physics)|Motion]] &amp;ndash; change in position over time.

== Types of dance ==

Type of dance &amp;ndash; a particular dance or dance style.  There are many varieties of dance.  Dance categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, [[tango (dance)|tango]] is traditionally a ''partner dance''. While it is mostly ''social dance'', its [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] form may be ''competitive dance'', as in [[DanceSport]]. At the same time it is enjoyed as ''performance dance'', whereby it may well be a ''solo dance''.

The '''grain''' or '''pibiones''' [[Weaving|weaving technique]] is most commonly found in the central and eastern areas of [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]]. This is a particular type of stitched relief, created from the countless grains that make up the design. These are made by twisting the [[yarn]] around a [[Sewing needle|needle]] which is arranged in a horizontal position on the [[loom]]; the needle is then pulled away, thereby creating a raised effect (grains).

These '''grains''' are fastened by the weft threads and are fixed in position by one or more strokes of the beater. ''Operated entirely by hand'', including the slay mechanism, i.e. the working phase effected by a complicated mechanism moved by the hands and feet which tightens the weft yarns one against the other once they have passed over the [[pin]].

The Pibiones technique was used in antiquity only for the best hand-woven bed covers “sa faona” and for household articles such as [[curtain]]s, [[fabrics]], cushions and tablecloths.

'''Polycount''' is a website and community of professional &amp; hobbyist artists that specialize in creating [[3D art]] for [[video games]].

== History ==
Founded on April 1, 1998 by Andrew Risch and Ted Shockey, the site was originally named Q2PMP (Quake2 Player Model Pack), featuring user created [[Quake 2]] plug-in characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mejia|first=Ozzie|title=Community Spotlight: Polycount|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/75305/community-spotlight-polycount#|publisher=Shacknews|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present ==
Polycount is widely known for its community forum, but also features a wiki for resources for 3D artists, and a front-page news section covering contests, interviews and spotlighting resident artists. Polycount was a large part of the Mann Co.

'''Professional wrestling''' (often shortened to '''pro wrestling''' or simply '''wrestling''') is a form of [[entertainment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-to-watch-pro-wrestling-responsibly-2015-9|title= Everything you think you know about professional wrestling is wrong|last= Weller|first= Chris|date= September 13, 2015|publisher= Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/news/wwes-xavier-woods-defends-the-art-of-pro-wrestling-20160422|title= WWE's Xavier Woods Defends the 'Art' of Pro Wrestling|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which combines [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletics]] with [[Performing arts|theatrical performance]].&lt;ref name="Barthes" /&gt; It takes the form of events, held by [[Professional wrestling promotion|touring companies]], which [[Mock combat|mimic]] a [[Championship#Title match system|title-match]] [[combat sport]].

Much of these derive from the influence of [[List of martial arts|various international]] [[martial arts]]. An additional aspect of combat with [[improvised weapon]]ry is sometimes included to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/902658-wwe-the-50-best-props-in-wrestling-history|title=WWE: The 50 Best Props in Wrestling History|last=Massey|first=Daniel|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/895919-the-top-10-best-illegal-weapons-in-pro-wrestling-history#slide0|title=The Top 10 Best Illegal Weapons in Pro Wrestling History|last=Clark|first=Tom|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The matches have predetermined outcomes&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
to heighten [[entertainment]] value&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|last= Grabianowski|first= Ed|url= https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling1.htm|title= How Pro Wrestling Works|publisher= Entertainment.howstuffworks.com|date= January 13, 2006|accessdate= September 9, 2018 | quote = Pro wrestling is more or less open about the fact that the stories and plots are predetermined.

&lt;/ref&gt;
and all combative maneuvers are [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|executed with the full cooperation of those involved]] and carefully performed in specific manners intended to lessen the chance of actual injury.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
These facts were once kept [[Trade secret|highly secret]], but are now a widely accepted [[open secret]]. By and large, the true nature of the performance is not discussed by the performing company in official media - in order to sustain and promote the willing [[suspension of disbelief]] for the audience by maintaining an aura of [[verisimilitude (fiction)|verisimilitude]]. Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media (i.e. interviews) will often directly acknowledge the dramatic and "fixed" nature of the spectacle.

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
{{main|History of professional wrestling}}
Originating as a popular form of entertainment in 19th-century Europe&lt;ref name="FILA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=100246&amp;lang=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011195312/http://fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=100246&amp;lang=en|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 October 2011|title=Roots and history of Olympic wrestling|last=Anon|work=International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|publisher=FILA|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later as a [[sideshow]] exhibition in [[North America]]n [[traveling carnival]]s and [[vaudeville]] [[music hall|halls]], professional wrestling grew into a standalone genre of entertainment with many diverse variations in cultures around the globe, and is now a billion dollar entertainment industry. Since the 1980s, local forms have greatly declined in Europe,&lt;!---OLD SCHOOL EUROPEAN PRO WRESTLING STILL EXISTS IN THE uK AND TO A LESSER EXTENT FRANCE AND GERMANY ---&gt; wrestling from North America has experienced several different periods of prominent cultural popularity during its century and a half of existence and has been exported back to Europe to fill the cultural gap left by the aforementioned decline of local versions. The advent of television gave professional wrestling a new outlet, and wrestling (along with [[boxing]]) was instrumental in making [[pay-per-view]] a viable method of [[Digital distribution|content delivery]].

Show wrestling has become especially prominent in [[Central America|Central]]/North America, Japan and Europe ([[Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom|especially the United Kingdom]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2007/10/22/encuesta-de-mitofsky-revela-que-la-lucha-no-es-el-segundo-deporte-mas-popular-en-mexico/|title=Encuesta De Mitofsky Revela Que La Lucha No Es El Segundo Deporte Mas Popular En Mexico|author=Yoav|date=October 22, 2007|accessdate=September 5, 2009|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804090134/http://superluchas.net/2007/10/22/encuesta-de-mitofsky-revela-que-la-lucha-no-es-el-segundo-deporte-mas-popular-en-mexico/|archivedate=August 4, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brazil]], there was a very popular wrestling television program from the 1960s to the early 1980s called ''[[Telecatch]]''. High-profile figures in the sport have become celebrities or [[cultural icon]]s in their native or adopted home countries.

Although professional wrestling started out as small acts in [[sideshow]]s, traveling [[circus]]es and [[traveling carnival|carnivals]], today it is a billion-dollar industry. Revenue is drawn from ticket sales, network television broadcasts, [[pay-per-view]] broadcasts, branded merchandise and home video. Pro wrestling was instrumental in making pay-per-view a viable method of content delivery.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Annual shows such as [[WrestleMania]], [[TNA Bound for Glory|Bound for Glory]] and formerly [[Starrcade]] are among the highest-selling pay-per-view programming each year. In modern day, internet programming has been utilized by a number of companies to air web shows, internet pay per views (IPPVs) or on-demand content, helping to generate internet-related revenue earnings from the evolving [[World Wide Web]].

Home video sales dominate the [[Billboard charts]] Recreational Sports DVD sales, with wrestling holding anywhere from 3 to 9 of the top 10 spots every week.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard Recreational Sports Weekly Top 10 -- [http://www.letstalkwrestling.com/search/label/Billboard%20Recrational%20Sports%20DVD%20charts Billboard Sports Weekly DVD Sales] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107004140/http://www.letstalkwrestling.com/search/label/Billboard%20Recrational%20Sports%20DVD%20charts |date=2015-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its persistent cultural presence and to its novelty within the performing arts, wrestling constitutes [[#Study and analysis of professional wrestling|a recurring topic in both academia and the media]]. Several documentaries have been produced looking at professional wrestling, most notably, ''[[Beyond the Mat]]'' directed by Barry W. Blaustein, and ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows|Wrestling with Shadows]]'' featuring wrestler [[Bret Hart]] and directed by Paul Jay. There have also been many fictional depictions of wrestling; the 2008 film ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]'' received several [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations and began a career revival for star [[Mickey Rourke]].

Currently, the largest professional wrestling company worldwide is the United States-based [[WWE]], which bought out many smaller regional companies in the late 20th century, as well as its primary US competitors [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in early 2001. Other prominent professional wrestling companies worldwide include the US-based [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|Impact Wrestling]], formerly known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), and [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH); [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] and [[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide]] in Mexico; and the Japanese [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]], [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] leagues.

{{main|Kayfabe|Shoot (professional wrestling)}}
When talking about professional wrestling, there are two levels: the "in-show" happenings that are presented through the shows, and happenings which are outside the scope of performance (in other words, are [[real life]]) but have implications on the performance, such as performer contracts, legitimate injuries, etc. Because actual events are often co-opted by writers for incorporation into storylines for the performers, the lines are often blurred and become confused.

Special care must be taken when talking about people who perform under their own name. The actions of the character should be considered fictional events, wholly separate from the life of the performer. This is similar to other entertainers who perform with a persona that shares their own name (such as [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Kurt Angle (character)|his fictional persona]]).

Some wrestlers would incorporate elements of their real-life personalities into their characters, even if they and their in-ring persona have different names.

=== Kayfabe ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
Historians are unsure at what point wrestling changed from competitive catch wrestling into worked entertainment. Those who participated felt that maintenance of a constant and complete illusion for all who were not involved was necessary to keep audience interest. For decades, wrestlers lived their public lives as though they were their characters.

The practice of keeping the illusion, and the various methods used to do so, came to be known as "[[kayfabe]]" within wrestling circles, or "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|working]] the [[Confidence trick|marks]]". An entire lexicon of slang jargon and euphemism developed to allow performers to communicate without outsiders' knowledge of what was being said.

Occasionally a performer will deviate from the intended sequence of events. This is known as a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]]. Sometimes shoot-like elements are included in wrestling stories to blur the line between performance and reality. These are known as "worked shoots". However, the vast majority of events in professional wrestling are preplanned and improvised within accepted boundaries.

Gradually, the predetermined nature of professional wrestling became an open secret, as prominent figures in the wrestling business (including World Wrestling Entertainment owner Vince McMahon) began to publicly admit that wrestling was entertainment, not competition. This public reveal has garnered mixed reactions from the wrestling community, as some feel that exposure ruins the experience to the spectators as does [[Exposure (magic)|exposure]] in [[Magic (illusion)|illusionism]]. Despite the public admission of the theatrical nature of professional wrestling, many U.S. states still [[Regulation of sport|regulate]] professional wrestling as they do other professional competitive sports. For example, New York State still regulates "professional wrestling" through the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] (SAC).
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dos.ny.gov/athletic/] The New York State Athletic Commission (SAC), March 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aspects of performing art ===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
Professional wrestling shows can be considered a form of [[theater in the round]], with the ring, ringside area, and entryway comprising a [[stage (theatre)|stage]]. However, there is a much more limited concept of a [[fourth wall]] than in most theatric performances. The audience is recognized and acknowledged by the performers as [[spectator sport|spectators]] to the sporting event being portrayed, and are encouraged to interact as such. This leads to a high level of audience participation; in fact, their reactions can dictate how the performance unfolds.&lt;ref name="Barthes" /&gt; Often, individual matches will be part of a longer story line conflict between "[[Face (professional wrestling)|babyfaces]]" (often shortened to just "faces") and "[[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]]". "Faces" (the "good guys") are those whose actions are intended to encourage the audience to cheer, while "heels" (the "bad guys") act to draw the spectators' ire.&lt;ref name="HSW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm |title=How Pro Wrestling Works |last=Grabianowski |first=Ed |work=HowStuffWorks, Inc. |publisher=[[Discovery Communications]] |accessdate=2014-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LDla2zy5?url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm |archivedate=2013-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
There is no governing authority for professional wrestling rules, although there is a general standard which has developed. Each [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] has their own variation, but all are similar enough to avoid confusion most of the time. Any rule described here is simply a standard, and may or may not correspond exactly with any given promotion's ruleset.

Due to the staged nature of wrestling, these are not actual "rules"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling2.htm|title=How Pro Wrestling Works|date=2006-01-13|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense that they would be considered in similar articles about actual sports like [[freestyle wrestling]]. Instead, the "rules" in this article are implemented and supposedly enforced for the sake of [[suspension of disbelief]] (known as [[kayfabe]] in the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|jargon of the business]]).

=== General structure ===
Matches are held between two or more sides ("corners"). Each corner may consist of one wrestler, or a team of two or more. Most team matches are governed by tag team rules (see below). Other matches are free-for-alls, with multiple combatants but no teams. In all variants, there can be only one winning team or wrestler.

The standard method of scoring is the "fall", which is accomplished by:
* [[Pin (professional wrestling)|Pinning]] the opponent's shoulders to the mat, typically for three seconds (though other times have been used)
* Forcing the opponent to [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submit]]
* [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|Disqualification]] of the opponent
* The opponent remaining outside the ring for too long ([[#Countout|countout]])
* [[Knockout|Knocking out]] or otherwise incapacitating the opponent
These are each explained in greater detail below. Typically, pinfalls and submissions must occur within the ring area, however there are times where it may be stipulated otherwise.

Most wrestling matches last for a set number of falls, with the first side to achieve the majority number of pinfalls, submissions, or countouts being the winner. Historically, matches were wrestled to 3 falls ("best 2 out of 3") or 5 falls ("best 3 out of 5"). The standard for modern matches is one fall. However, even though it is now standard, many announcers will explicitly state this (e.g. "The following contest is set for one fall with a 20-minute time limit.") These matches are given a time limit; if not enough falls are scored by the end of the time limit, the match is declared a draw. Modern matches are generally given a 10- to 30-minute time limit for standard matches; title matches can go for up to one hour. British wrestling matches held under [[Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules]] are 2 out of 3 falls.

An alternative is a match set for a prescribed length of time, with a running tally of falls. The entrant with the most falls at the end of the time limit is declared the winner. This is usually for 20, 30 or 60 minutes, and is commonly called an [[Iron Man match]]. This type of match can be modified so that fewer types of falls are allowed.

In matches with multiple competitors, an elimination system may be used. Any wrestler who has a fall scored against them is forced out of the match, and the match continues until only one remains. However, it is much more common when more than two wrestlers are involved to simply go one fall, with the one scoring the fall, regardless of who they scored it against, being the winner. In championship matches, this means that, unlike one-on-one matches (where the champion can simply disqualify himself or get himself counted out to retain the title via the '''Champion&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Advantage'''), the champion does ''not'' have to be pinned or involved in the decision to lose the championship. However, [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] champions often find advantages, not in Champion's Advantage, but in the use of weapons and outside interference, as these poly-sided matches tend to involve [[hardcore wrestling|no holds barred]] rules.

[[File:Professional wrestling ladder match.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A WWE [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], 2009]]
Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the [[ladder match]]. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize).  Another common specialty match is known as the [[battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]]. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple objective is to throw the opponent over the top rope and out of the ring with both feet on the floor to eliminate that opponent. The last wrestler standing is declared the winner. A variant on this type of match is the WWE's [[Royal Rumble]] where two wrestlers enter the ring to start the match and other wrestlers follow in 90 second intervals (previously 2 minutes) until 30-40 wrestlers have entered the ring. All other rules stay the same. For more match types, see [[Professional wrestling match types]].

Every match must be assigned a rule keeper known as a [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]], who is the final arbitrator. In multi-man [[lucha libre]] matches, two referees are used, one inside the ring and one outside.

Due to the [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|legitimate]] role that referees play in wrestling of serving as liaison between the bookers backstage and the wrestlers in the ring (the role of being a final arbitrator is merely [[kayfabe]]), the referee is present, even in matches that do not at first glance appear to require a referee (such as a ladder match, as it is no holds barred, and the criteria for victory could theoretically be assessed from afar). Although their actions are also frequently scripted for dramatic effect, referees are subject to certain general rules and requirements to maintain the theatrical appearance of unbiased authority. The most basic rule is that an action must be seen by a referee to be declared for a fall or disqualification. This allows for [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] characters to gain a scripted advantage by distracting or disabling the referee to perform some ostensibly illegal maneuver on their opponent. Most referees are unnamed and essentially anonymous, though some wrestling promotions have let their officials reveal their names.

Special [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|guest referee]]s may be used from time to time; by virtue of their celebrity status, they are often scripted to dispense with the appearance of neutrality and use their influence to unfairly influence the outcome of the match for added dramatic impact. Face special referees will often fight back against hostile heel wrestlers, particularly if the special referee is either a wrestler himself or a famous martial artist (such as [[Tito Ortiz]] at the main event at [[Hard Justice (2005)|TNA Hard Justice 2005]]).

For heel special referees, common ways of assisting the heel wrestler to obtain victory include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Counting fast whenever the face wrestler is being pinned, while counting slow, faking a wrist or eye injury, or even refusing to count at all, when the heel wrestler is being pinned.
* Allowing heel wrestlers to use blatantly illegal tactics that most normal referees would instantly disqualify for, while not extending these relaxed rules to face wrestlers.
* Disqualifying the face wrestler for unfair reasons, such as an accidental attack on the referee or a maneuver that appears to be an illegal attack.
* Feigning unconsciousness far longer than they would normally otherwise be out, or using convenient distractions to look away from the wrestlers for a prolonged period of time. This allows for greater opportunities for run-ins or use of illegal weapons and tactics, or can be used as an excuse to avoid counting a pinfall or calling a submission in the face's favor. The referee often instantly up the moment the heel wrestler seems to have an advantage, usually the moment the heel goes for the pinfall or applies a submission finisher.
* Actually assisting in attacking the face wrestler.

Matches are held within a [[wrestling ring]], an elevated square [[canvas]] mat with posts on each corner. A cloth apron hangs over the edges of the ring. Three horizontal ropes or cables surround the ring, suspended with turnbuckles which are connected to the posts. For safety, the ropes are padded at the turnbuckles and cushioned mats surround the floor outside the ring. Guardrails or a similar barrier enclose this area from the audience. Wrestlers are generally expected to stay within the confines of the ring, though matches sometimes end up outside the ring, and even in the audience, to add excitement.

=== Tag rules ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
{{main|Tag team}}
[[Image:Jeff-Hardy-Dropkick,-RLA-Melb-10.11.2007 filtered.jpg|thumb|250px|A tag team match in progress: [[Jeff Hardy]] kicks [[Umaga (wrestler)|Umaga]], while their respective partners, [[Triple H]] and [[Randy Orton]], encourage them and reach for the tags]]
In some team matches, only one entrant from each team may be designated as the "legal" or "active" wrestler at any given moment. Two wrestlers must make physical contact (typically palm-to-palm) to transfer this legal status. This is known as a "tag", with the participants "tagging out" and "tagging in". Typically the wrestler who is tagging out has a 5-second count to leave the ring, whereas the one tagging in can enter the ring at any time, resulting in heels legally double-teaming a face.

The non-legal wrestlers must remain outside the ring or other legal area at all times (and avoid purposeful contact with the opposing wrestlers) or face reprimand from the referee. In most promotions, the wrestler to be tagged in must be touching the turnbuckle on his corner, or a cloth strap attached to the turnbuckle.

Some multi-wrestler matches allow for a set number of legal wrestlers, and a legal wrestler may tag out to any other wrestler, regardless of team. In these matches, the tag need not be a mutual effort, and this results in active wrestlers being tagged out against their will, or non-legal wrestlers forced to enter the battle.

Sometimes, poly-sided matches that pit every man for himself will incorporate tagging rules. Outside of kayfabe, this is done to give wrestlers a break from the action (as these matches tend to go on for long periods of time), and to make the action in the ring easier to choreograph. One of the most mainstream examples of this is the Four-Corner match, the most common type of match in the [[WWE]] before it was replaced with its equivalent Fatal Four-Way; four wrestlers, each for himself, fight in a match, but only two wrestlers can be in the match at any given time. The other two are positioned in the corner, and tags can be made between any two wrestlers.

In a Texas Tornado Tag Team match, all the competitors are legal in the match, and tagging in and out is not necessary. All matches fought under [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore rules]] (such as no disqualification, no holds barred, [[ladder match]], etc.) are all contested under ''[[de facto]]'' Texas Tornado rules, since the lack of ability of a referee to issue a disqualification renders any tagging requirements moot.

Regardless of rules of tagging, a wrestler cannot pin his or her own tag team partner, even if it is technically possible from the rules of the match (e.g. Texas Tornado rules, or a three-way tag team match). This is called the "Outlaw Rule" because the first team to attempt to use that (in an attempt to unfairly retain their tag team titles) was the [[New Age Outlaws]].

=== Decisions ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}

==== Pinfall ====
{{main|Pin (professional wrestling)}}
[[File:Big John defeats Sensuelle Rosé.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An example of pinfall]]
To score by pinfall, a wrestler must pin both his opponent's shoulders against the mat while the referee slaps the mat three times (referred to as a "three count"). This is the most common form of defeat. The pinned wrestler must also be on his back and, if s/he is lying on his stomach, it usually does not count. A count may be started at any time that a wrestler's shoulders are down (both shoulders touching the mat), back-first and any part of the opponent's body is lying over the wrestler. This often results in pins that can easily be kicked out of, if the defensive wrestler is even slightly conscious. For example, an attacking wrestler who is half-conscious may simply drape an arm over an opponent, or a cocky wrestler may place his foot gently on the opponent's body, prompting a three-count from the referee.

Illegal pinning methods include using the ropes for leverage and hooking the opponent's clothing, which are therefore popular cheating methods for [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], unless certain stipulations make such an advantage legal. Such pins as these are rarely seen by the referee and are subsequently often used by heels and on occasion by cheating faces to win matches. Even if it is noticed, it is rare for such an attempt to result in a disqualification (see below) and instead it simply results in nullification of the pin attempt, so the heel wrestler rarely has anything to lose for trying it anyway.

Occasionally, there are instances where a pinfall is made where both wrestlers' shoulders were on the mat for the three-count. This situation will most likely lead to a draw, and in some cases a continuation of the match or a future match to determine the winner.

==== Submission ====
To score by submission, the wrestler must make his opponent give up, usually, but not necessarily, by putting him in a submission hold (e.g. figure four leg-lock, arm-lock, sleeper-hold).

[[File:John Cena performs STF against Mark Henry.jpg|thumb|250px|[[John Cena]] performs his [[Professional wrestling holds#STF|STF]] submission hold against [[Mark Henry]]]]
A wrestler may voluntarily submit by verbally informing the referee (usually used in moves such as the Mexican Surfboard, where all four limbs are incapacitated, making tapping impossible). Also, since [[Ken Shamrock]] popularized it in 1997, a wrestler can indicate a voluntary submission by "[[Submission (combat sports)|tapping out]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grabianowski| first=Ed|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling2.htm|title=Rules of professional wrestling|publisher=Entertainment.howstuffworks.com|date=2006-01-13| accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, tapping a free hand against the mat or against an opponent. Occasionally, a wrestler will reach for a rope (see rope breaks below), only to put his hand back on the mat so he can crawl towards the rope some more; this is NOT a submission, and the referee decides what his intent is. Submission was initially a large factor in professional wrestling, but following the decline of the submission-oriented [[Catch wrestling|catch-as-catch-can]] style from mainstream professional wrestling, the submission largely faded. Despite this, some wrestlers, such as [[Chris Jericho]], [[Ric Flair]], [[Bret Hart]], [[Kurt Angle]], [[Ken Shamrock]], [[Dean Malenko]], [[Chris Benoit]], and [[Tazz]], became famous for winning matches via submission. A wrestler with a signature submission technique is portrayed as better at applying the hold, making it more painful or more difficult to get out of than others who use it, or can be falsely credited as inventing the hold (such as when Tazz popularized the [[kata ha jime]] judo choke in pro wrestling as the "Tazzmission").

Since all contact between the wrestlers must cease if any part of the body is touching, or underneath, the ropes, many wrestlers will attempt to break submission holds by deliberately grabbing the bottom ropes. This is called a "rope break", and it is one of the most common ways to break a submission hold. Most holds leave an arm or leg free, so that the person can tap out if he wants. Instead, he uses these free limbs to either grab one of the ring ropes (the bottom one is the most common, as it is nearest the wrestlers, though other ropes sometimes are used for standing holds such as [[Chris Masters]]' Master Lock) or drape his foot across, or underneath one. Once this has been accomplished, and the accomplishment is witnessed by the referee, the referee will demand that the offending wrestler break the hold, and start counting to five if the wrestler does not. If the referee reaches the count of five, and the wrestler still does not break the hold, he is disqualified.

If a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] decides that his client wrestler should tap out, but cannot convince the wrestler himself to do so, he may "throw in the towel" (by literally taking a gym towel and hurling it into the ring where the referee can see it). This is the same as a submission, as in [[kayfabe]] the manager is considered the wrestlers [[Law of agency|agent]] and therefore authorized to make formal decisions (such as forfeiting a match) on the client's behalf.

==== Knockout ====
Passing out in a submission hold constitutes a loss by [[knockout]]. To determine if a wrestler has passed out in WWE, the referee usually picks up and drops his hand. If it drops to the mat or floor three consecutive times without the wrestler having the strength to hold it up, the wrestler is considered to have passed out. At one point this was largely ignored. However, the rule is now much more commonly observed for safety reasons. If the wrestler has passed out, the opponent then scores by submission.

A wrestler can also win by knockout if he does not resort to submission holds, but stills pummels his opponent to the point that he is completely out cold. To check for a knockout in this manner a referee would wave his hand in front of the wrestlers' face and, if the wrestler does not react in any way, the referee would award the victory to the other wrestler.

==== Countout ====
A countout (alternatively "count-out" or "count out") happens when a wrestler is out of the ring long enough for the referee to count to ten (twenty in some promotions) and thus disqualified. The count is broken and restarted when a wrestler in the ring exits the ring. Playing into this, some wrestlers would "milk" the count by sliding in the ring and immediately sliding back out. As he was technically inside the ring for a split second before exiting again, it is sufficient to restart the count. This is often referred to by commentators as "breaking the count". Heels often use this tactic in order to buy themselves more time to catch their breath, or to attempt to frustrate their [[face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] opponents.

If all the active wrestlers in a match are down inside the ring at the same time, the referee would begin a count (usually ten seconds, twenty in Japan). If nobody rises to their feet by the end of the count, the match is ruled a draw. Any participant who stands up in time would end the count for everyone else, while in a Last Man Standing match this form of a countout is the only way that the match can end, so the referee would count when one or more wrestlers are down and one wrestler standing up before the 10-count does not stop the count for another wrestler who is still down.

In some promotions (and most major modern ones), Championships cannot change hands via a countout, unless the on-screen authority declares it for at least one match, although in others, championships may change hands via countout. Heels are known to take advantage of this and will intentionally get counted out when facing difficult opponents, especially when defending championships.

==== Disqualification ====
Disqualification (sometimes abbreviated as "DQ") occurs when a wrestler violates the match's rules, thus losing automatically. Although a countout can technically be considered a disqualification (as it is, for all intents and purposes, an automatic loss suffered as a result of violating a match rule), the two concepts are often distinct in wrestling. A no disqualification match can still end by countout (although this is rare). Typically, a match must be declared a "no holds barred" match, a "street fight" or some other term, in order for both disqualifications and countouts to be waived.

Disqualification from a match is called for a number of reasons:
* Performing any illegal holds or maneuvers, such as refusing to break a hold when an opponent is in the ropes, hair-pulling, choking or biting an opponent, or repeatedly punching with a closed fist. These violations are usually subject to a referee-administered five count and will result in disqualification if the wrestler does not cease the offending behavior in time. Note that the ban on closed fists does not apply if the attacker is in middair when the punch connects, like with [[Jerry Lawler]]'s diving fist drop or [[Roman Reigns]]' [[Superman Punch]].
* Attacking an opponent's eye, such as raking it, poking it, [[Eye-gouging|gouging it]], punching it or other severe attacks to the eye.
* Any outside interference involving a person not involved in the match striking or holding a wrestler. Sometimes (depending on the promotion and uniqueness of the situation), if a heel attempts to interfere but is ejected from the ring by a wrestler or referee before this occurs, there may not be a disqualification. In this disqualification method, the wrestler being attacked by the foreign member is awarded the win. Sometimes, however, this can work in heels' favor. In February 2009, [[Shawn Michaels]], who was under the [[kayfabe]] employment of [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]], interfered in a match and super kicked JBL in front of the referee to get his employer the win via "outside interference".
* Striking an opponent with a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|foreign object]] (an object not permitted by the rules of the match; see [[hardcore wrestling]]) (sometimes the win decision can be reversed if the referee spots the weapon before pin attempt or after the match because they tried to strike when referee is either distracted or knocked out).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wgcsIi1RBI World Champion Bully Ray vs. Samoa Joe - Oct 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using any kind of "banned" move (see below for details).
* A direct [[Groin attack|low blow to the groin]] (unless the rules of the match specifically allow this).
* Intentionally laying hands on the referee.
* Pulling an opponent's mask off during a match (this is illegal in Mexico, and sometimes in Japan).
* Throwing an opponent over the top rope during a match (this move is still illegal in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], however, in cases like the [[Royal Rumble]] match, this will be allowed in order to eliminate a wrestler from the match.)
* In a mixed tag team match, a man hitting a woman(intergender), or a normal sized wrestler attacking an opposing midget wrestler(tag team matches involving teams with one normal-sized and one midget wrestler).

In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use his own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and ''immediately'' disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are [[Groin attack|low blows]], [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|weapon usage]], interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with his own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although ''dusty finishes'' (named after, and made famous by, [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term "ref bump". While the referee remains "unconscious", wrestlers are free to violate rules until he is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked him out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped into a referee at a slower speed, knocking the ref down for short amount of time; during that interim period, one wrestler may pin his opponent for a three-count and would have won the match but for the referee being down (sometimes, another referee will sprint to the ring from backstage to attempt to make the count, but by then, the other wrestler has had enough time to kick out on his own accord).

If all participants in a match continue to breach the referee's instructions, the match may end in a double disqualification, where both wrestlers or teams (in a [[tag team]] match) have been disqualified. The match is essentially nullified, and called a draw or in some cases a restart or the same match being held at a pay-per-view or next night's show.  Sometimes, however, if this happens in a match to determine the challenger for a heel champion's title, the champion is forced to face both opponents simultaneously for the title.  Usually, the double disqualification is caused by the heel wrestler's associates in a match between two face wrestlers to determine his opponent.

==== Forfeit ====
Although extremely rare, a match can end in a forfeit if the opponent either does not show up for the match, or shows up but refuses to compete. Although a championship usually cannot change hands except by pinfall or submission, a forfeit victory is enough to crown a new champion. The most famous example of this happened on the December 8, 1997 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw is War]]'', when [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] handed the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] to [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] after refusing to defend the title.

Forfeit victories are extremely rare in wrestling. When a pay-per-view match is booked and one wrestler is unable to make it for one reason or another, it is usually customary to insert a last minute replacement rather than award a wrestler a victory by forfeit. Forfeit victories are almost always reserved for when the story the promotion is telling specifically requires such an ending. In addition to the aforementioned moment between Steve Austin and The Rock, other instance of this happening was in March 2009, when Triple H decided not to show up for a handicap match against [[Cody Rhodes]] and [[Ted Dibiase Jr.]], instead opting to attack Randy Orton in his own home.

Despite being, statistically, an extremely rare occurrence, [[The Godfather (wrestler)#Intercontinental Champion (1998–2000)|Charles Wright]] is one wrestler who is famous for turning forfeit victories into his own gimmick. During the late 1990s, Wright called himself "The Godfather" and portrayed the gimmick of a pimp. He would often bring multiple women, who he referred to as "hoes," to the ring with him, and would offer the sexual services of these women to his opponents in exchange for them forfeiting their matches against him.

==== Draw ====
A professional wrestling match can end in a draw. A draw occurs if both opponents are simultaneously disqualified (as via [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] or if the referee loses complete control of the match and both opponents attack each other with no regard to being in a match, like Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker at 2002 Unforgiven), neither opponent is able to answer a ten-count, or both opponents simultaneously win the match. The latter can occur if, for example, one opponent's shoulders touch the mat while maintaining a submission hold against another opponent. If the opponent in the hold begins to [[Submission (combat sports)|tap out]] at the same time a referee counts to three for pinning the opponent delivering the hold, both opponents have legally achieved scoring conditions simultaneously. Traditionally, a championship may not change hands in the event of a draw (though it may become vacant), though some promotions such as [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] have endorsed rules where the champion may lose a title by disqualification. A variant of the draw is the time-limit draw, where the match does not have a winner by a specified time period (a one-hour draw, which was once common, is known in wrestling circles as a "Broadway").

Also if two wrestlers have been given a disqualification by either the referee or the chairman, this is a no contest and if there is a title on the line the champion keeps the championship.

==== No contest ====
A wrestling match may be declared a no contest if the winning conditions are unable to occur. This can be due to excessive interference, loss of referee's control over the match, one or more participants sustaining debilitating injury not caused by the opponent, or the inability of a scheduled match to even begin. A no contest is a state separate and distinct from a draw &amp;mdash; a draw indicates winning conditions were met. Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably in practice, this usage is technically incorrect.

== Dramatic elements ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
While each wrestling match is ostensibly a competition of athletics and strategy, the goal of each match from a business standpoint is to excite and entertain the audience. Although the competition is staged, dramatic emphasis can be utilized to draw out the most intense reaction from the audience. Heightened interest results in higher attendance rates, increased ticket sales, higher ratings on television broadcasts (which result in greater ad revenue), higher [[pay-per-view]] buyrates, and sales of branded merchandise and recorded video footage. All of these contribute to the profit of the promotion company.

=== Character/gimmick ===
[[Image:El Hijo De Santo vs Blue Demon Jr.jpg|thumb|[[Blue Demon, Jr.]] wrestles [[El Hijo del Santo]]]]
In Latin America and English-speaking countries, most wrestlers (and other on-stage performers) portray [[Persona|character]] roles, sometimes with personalities wildly different from their own. These personalities are a [[gimmick]] intended to heighten interest in a wrestler without regard to athletic ability. Some can be unrealistic and [[cartoon]]-like (such as [[Doink the Clown]]), while others carry more verisimilitude (such as [[Chris Jericho]], [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], [[John Cena]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]], and [[CM Punk]]). In [[lucha libre]], many characters wear masks, adopting a [[secret identity]] akin to a [[superhero]], a near-sacred tradition.&lt;ref name="SS1"&gt;{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=Lords of the Ring| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/04/lord-of-rings.html |publisher=SleuthSayers| location=Orlando| date=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual wrestler may sometimes use his real name, or a minor variation of it, for much of his career, such as [[Bret Hart]], [[John Cena]] and [[Randy Orton]]. Others can keep one ring name for their entire career (cases in point include [[Shawn Michaels]], [[CM Punk]] and [[Ricky Steamboat]]), or may change from time to time to better suit the demands of the audience or company. Sometimes a character is owned and trademarked by the company, forcing the wrestler to find a new one when he leaves (although a simple typeset change, such as changing [[Rhyno]] to '''Rhino''', can usually get around this), and sometimes a character is owned by the wrestler. Sometimes, a wrestler may change his legal name to obtain ownership of his ring name (examples include [[Test (wrestler)|Andrew Martin]] and [[The Ultimate Warrior|Warrior]]). Many wrestlers (such as [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and [[The Undertaker]]) are strongly identified with their character, even responding to the name in public or between friends. It's actually considered proper decorum for fellow wrestlers to refer to each other by their stage names/characters rather than their birth/legal names, unless otherwise introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Storm, Lance (August 9, 2010). [http://www.stormwrestling.com/080910.html "Q&amp;A Commentary"]. ''Storm Wrestling''.&lt;/ref&gt; A professional wrestling character's popularity can grow to the point that it makes appearances in other media (see [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[El Santo]]) or even give the performer enough visibility to enter [[politics]] ([[Antonio Inoki]] and [[Jesse Ventura]], among others).

Typically, matches are staged between a [[protagonist]] (historically an audience favorite, known as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], or "the good guy") and an [[antagonist]] (historically a villain with arrogance, a tendency to break rules, or other unlikable qualities, called a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]). In recent years, however, [[antihero]]es have also become prominent in professional wrestling. There is also a less common role of a "tweener", who is neither fully face nor fully heel yet able to play either role effectively (case in point, [[Samoa Joe]] during his first run in [[Impact Wrestling|TNA Wrestling]] from June 2005 to November 2006).

At times a character may "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]]", altering their face/heel alignment. This may be an abrupt, surprising event, or it may slowly build up over time. It almost always is accomplished with a markable change in behavior on the part of the character. Some turns become defining points in a wrestler's career, as was the case when [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|Hulk Hogan turned heel]] after being a top face for over a decade. Others may have no noticeable effect on the character's status. If a character repeatedly switches between being a face and heel, this lessens the effect of such turns, and may result in apathy from the audience. [[Vince McMahon]] is a good example of having more heel and face turns than anyone in WWE history.

As with personae in general, a character's face or heel alignment may change with time, or remain constant over its lifetime (the most famous example of the latter is [[Ricky Steamboat]], a [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r who remained a babyface throughout his entire career). Sometimes a character's heel turn will become so popular that eventually the audience response will alter the character's heel-face cycle to the point where the heel persona will, in practice, become a face persona, and what was previously the face persona, will turn into the heel persona, such as when [[Dwayne Johnson]] first began using "The Rock" persona as a heel character, as opposed to his original "Rocky Maivia" babyface persona.  Another legendary example is [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], who was originally booked as a heel, with such mannerisms as drinking on the job, using [[profanity]], breaking company property, and even [[Brian Pillman#World Wrestling Federation (1996–1997)|breaking into people's private homes]].  However, much to WWF's surprise, the fans got such a charge out of Austin's antics that he effectively became one of the greatest antiheroes in the history of the business. He, along with the stable of [[D-Generation X]], is generally credited with ushering in [[the Attitude Era]] of WWF programming.

=== Story ===
[[File:Broken Hardys Expedition of Gold.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Matt Hardy]] and [[Jeff Hardy]] as Broken Hardys]]
While true [[Exhibition game|exhibition match]]es are not uncommon, most matches tell a story analogous to a scene in a play or film, or an episode of a serial drama: The face will sometimes win (triumph) or sometimes lose (tragedy). Longer [[story arc]]s can result from multiple matches over the course of time. Since most promotions have a championship title, competition for the championship is a common impetus for stories. Also, anything from a character's own hair to his job with the promotion can be [[Gambling|wager]]ed in a match.

Some matches are designed to further a story of only one participant. It could be intended to portray him or her as a strong unstoppable force, a lucky underdog, a sore loser, or any other characterization. Sometimes non-wrestling [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s are shown to enhance a character's image without the need for matches.

Other stories result from a natural rivalry between two or more characters. Outside of performance, these are referred to as [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]]. A feud can exist between any number of participants and can last for a few days up to multiple decades. The feud between [[Ric Flair]] and [[Ricky Steamboat]] lasted from the late 1970s into the early 1990s and allegedly spanned over two thousand matches (although most of those matches were mere [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]]es). The career-spanning history between characters [[Mike Awesome]] and [[Masato Tanaka]] is another example of a long-running feud, as is the case of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] vs. [[Vince McMahon]], one of the most lucrative feuds in the World Wrestling Federation during 1998 and 1999.

In theory, the longer a feud is built up, the more audience interest (aka [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]]) will exist. The [[Card (sports)|main event]] of a wrestling show is generally the one with the most heat behind it. Commonly, a heel will hold the upper hand over a face until a final showdown, heightening dramatic tension as the face's fans desire to see him win.

Throughout the history of professional wrestling, many other elements and forms of media have been utilized in professional wrestling storytelling: pre- and post-match interviews, "backstage" skits, positions of authority and [[Work (professional wrestling)|worked]] behind-the-scenes feuds, division rankings (typically the #1-contendership spot), contracts, lotteries, news stories on websites, and in recent years [[social media]].

Also, anything that can be used as an element of drama can exist in professional wrestling stories: [[Romance (love)|romantic relationship]]s (including love triangles and marriage), racism, classism, nepotism, favoritism, corporate corruption, family bonds, personal histories, grudges, theft, cheating, assault, betrayal, bribery, seduction, stalking, confidence tricks, extortion, blackmail, substance abuse, self-doubt, self-sacrifice; even kidnapping, sexual fetishism,&lt;!--Gene Snitsky's foot fetish--&gt; necrophilia,&lt;!--Katie Vick--&gt; misogyny, rape and death have been portrayed in wrestling. Some promotions have included supernatural elements such as magic, curses, the [[undead]] and [[Satanism|Satanic]] imagery (most notably [[the Undertaker]] and his [[Ministry of Darkness]], a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] that regularly performed evil rituals and [[human sacrifice]] in Satanic-like worship of a hidden power figure). Celebrities would also be involved in storylines.

Commentators have become important in communicating the relevance of the characters' actions to the story at hand, filling in past details and pointing out subtle actions that may otherwise go unnoticed.

==== Promos ====
{{main|Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo}}
A main part of the story-telling part of wrestling is a promo, short for promotional interview. Promos are performed, or "cut", in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|wrestling jargon]], for a variety of reasons, including to heighten interest in a wrestler, or to hype an upcoming match.

Since the crowd is often too loud or the venue too large for promos to be heard naturally, wrestlers will use amplification when speaking in the ring. Unlike most Hollywood acting, large and highly visible handheld microphones are typically used and wrestlers often speak directly to the audience.

=== Championships ===
{{main|Championship (professional wrestling)}}
Professional wrestling mimics the structure of [[Champion|title match]] [[combat sport]]s. Participants compete for a [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championship]] and must defend it after winning it. These titles are represented physically by a [[Championship belt|title belt]] that can be worn by the champion. In the case of team wrestling, there is a title belt for each member of the team.

Almost all [[professional wrestling promotion]]s have one major title, and some have more. Championships are designated by divisions of weight, height, gender, wrestling style and other qualifications.

Typically, each promotion only recognizes the "legitimacy" of their own titles, although [[cross-promotion]] does happen. When one promotion absorbs or purchases another, the titles from the defunct promotion may continue to be defended in the new promotion or be decommissioned.

[[wikt:behind the scenes|Behind the scenes]], the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|bookers]] in a company will place the title on the most accomplished performer, or those the bookers believe will generate [[Fandom|fan]] interest in terms of event attendance and television viewership. Lower ranked titles may also be used on the performers who show potential, thus allowing them greater exposure to the audience. However other circumstances may also determine the use of a championship. A combination of a championship's lineage, the caliber of performers as champion, and the frequency and manner of title changes, dictates the audience's perception of the title's quality, significance and reputation.

A wrestler's championship accomplishments can be central to their career, becoming a measure of their performance ability and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Draw|drawing]] power. In general, a wrestler with multiple title reigns or an extended title reign is indicative of a wrestler's ability to maintain audience interest or a wrestler's ability to perform in the ring. As such, the most accomplished or decorated wrestlers tend to be revered as legends despite the predetermined nature of title reigns. American wrestler [[Ric Flair]] has had multiple [[World heavyweight championship (professional wrestling)|world heavyweight championship]] reigns spanning over three decades. Japanese wrestler [[Último Dragón]] once held and defended a record 10 titles simultaneously.

=== Non-standard matches ===
Often a match will take place under additional rules, usually serving as a special attraction or a climactic point in a feud or storyline. Sometimes this will be the culmination of an entire feud, ending it for the immediate future (known as a blowoff match).

Perhaps the most well-known non-standard match is the [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|cage match]], in which the ring is surrounded by a fence or similar metal structure, with the express intention of preventing escape or outside interference—and with the added bonus of the cage being a potentially brutal weapon or platform for launching attacks. The WWE has another provision where a standard cage match can end with one wrestler or wrestling team escaping the cage through the door or over the top.

Another example is the WWE's Royal Rumble match, which involves thirty participants in a random and unknown order. The Rumble match is itself a spectacle in that it is a once-yearly event with multiple participants, including individuals who might not interact otherwise. It also serves as a catalyst for the company's ongoing feuds, as well as a springboard for new storylines.

=== Ring entrance ===
[[Image:Triple H Entrance Sequence Melbourne 10.11.2007.jpg|thumb|450px|[[Triple H]] performing his ring entrance pose, mounting the second rope and displaying his physique, under strobe lights]]
While the wrestling matches themselves are the primary focus of professional wrestling, a key dramatic element of the business can be entrances of the wrestlers to the arena and ring. It is typical for a wrestler to get their biggest crowd reaction (or "pop") for their ring entrance, rather than for anything they do in the wrestling match itself, especially if former main event stars are returning to a promotion after a long absence.

All notable wrestlers now enter the ring accompanied by music, and regularly add other elements to their entrance. The music played during the ring entrance will usually mirror the wrestler's personality. Many wrestlers, particularly in America, have music and lyrics specially written for their ring entrance. While invented long before, the practice of including music with the entrance gained rapid popularity during the 1980s, largely as a result of the huge success of [[Hulk Hogan]] and the WWF, and their [[1980s professional wrestling boom|Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]. When a match is won, the victor's theme music is usually also played in celebration.

Because wrestling is predetermined, a wrestler's entrance music will play as they enter the arena, even if they are, in [[kayfabe]], not supposed to be there. For example, in 2012 through 2014, [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]] was a trio of wrestlers who were (in kayfabe) not at the time under contract with WWE (hence their gimmick of entering the ring through the crowd), but they still had entrance music which was played whenever they entered the arena, despite the fact that they were kayfabe invaders.

With the introduction of the Titantron entrance screen in 1997, WWF/WWE wrestlers also had entrance videos made that would play along with their entrance music.

Other dramatic elements of a ring entrance can include:
* [[Pyrotechnics]]
* Additional visual graphics or staging props to complement the entrance video/routine or further emphasize the character. For instance, [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]'s entrance graphics employ heavy use of fire-themed visuals, [[The Undertaker]]'s entrance features dark lighting, fire, fog and dry ice, and lightning-themed effects, [[John Morrison (wrestler)|John Morrison]]'s entrance would feature use of multicolored psychedelic style patterns, [[The Miz]] has in the past incorporated inflatable lettering spelling out the word "AWESOME" into his entrance, and [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] frequently used an inflatable entrance tunnel during his [[WWE]] tenure. [[Goldust]] has been known to use on-screen visual effects in his entrance to simulate the presentation of a feature film (i.e. widescreen, production company credits), as to emphasize his Hollywood-themed film aficionado character. [[Brodus Clay]] entered with disco ball lighting effects to emphasize his "Funkasaurus" character.
* A distinct sound or opening note in the music (used to elicit a [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian]] response from the crowd). For example, the glass shattering in [[WWF The Music, Vol. 3|Steve Austin's entrance theme]], [[The Undertaker]]'s signature [[Funeral toll|bell toll]], or the sound of bells and a cow's moo in JBL's theme.
* Darkening of the arena, often accompanied by [[Stage lighting|mood lighting]] or [[strobe light]]ing, such as in The Undertaker's, [[Triple H]]'s, or [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]'s entrances. Certain colors of lighting have been associated with specific wrestlers; for instance, blue lighting for [[The Undertaker]], green lighting for Triple H, [[D-Generation X]], and [[Shane McMahon]], red and orange lighting for [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], multicolored lighting for [[John Morrison (wrestler)|John Morrison]], gold lighting for [[Dustin Rhodes|Goldust]], pink lighting for [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]], and so forth.
* Costumes that evoke "otherworldly" or "fictional" themes. With examples such as Big Van Vader's bio-mechanical themed headdress which spewed steam, Pyro's fire shooting outfit, Shockmaster's bejeweled space helmet, and Ricky Steamboat's dragon costume, to name a few.
* Entering in a manner in keeping with their character traits, such as a fast, highly energetic entrance, or a slow, stoic entrance. For example, The Ultimate Warrior would run at high speed down the entrance ramp and into the ring while [[Randy Orton]] would slowly and darkly walk to the ring. The Undertaker has adopted one of the most notable entrances, taking around 4 to 5 minutes, darkening the whole arena, and performing a slow, intimidating walk. Like sound effects, some entrance mannerisms often become signature to individual wrestlers. For example, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]'s entrance often involves him standing on the second turnbuckle, raising his hands in the air for few seconds, and then doing the same thing for the other three turnbuckles, a mannerism which has become just as much a signature part of Austin's entrance as the glass-shattering sound effect.
* Driving a vehicle into the arena. For example, [[Eddie Guerrero]] would arrive into the arena in a lowrider, The Undertaker (in his "American Bad Ass" biker gimmick), [[Chuck Palumbo]], [[Lisa Marie Varon|Tara]], and the [[Disciples of Apocalypse]] on motorcycles, [[The Mexicools]] on riding lawn mowers, JBL in his limousine, [[Alberto Del Rio]] arriving into the arena in various luxury cars, Steve Austin driving an [[all-terrain vehicle]], and perhaps most recently [[Camacho (wrestler)|Camacho]] and [[Hunico]] entering on a lowrider bicycle.
* Acting out a trademark behavior, such as posing to display their [[Bodybuilding|muscularity]], mounting the ring ropes, or sitting in the corner.
* Talking to the crowd using a distinctive [[patter]]. For instance, chanting or rapping along with the music (i.e. [[Road Dogg]], [[Ron Killings|R-Truth]]). Another example is [[Vickie Guerrero]] entering to no music, but announcing her arrival with the words "Excuse me!"
* Many [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] with narcissistic gimmicks ([[Lex Luger]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Cody Rhodes]], [[Paul Orndorff]], etc.) would admire themselves with a mirror on their way to the ring.
* Coming through the audience, such as [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman's]] beer drinking and can smashing entrance, or [[Diamond Dallas Page]]'s exit through the crowd, or most recently, The Shield walking through the arena.
* Accompaniment by a [[Cornerman|ringside crew]] or personal security, an example of which would be [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]]
* Entering the arena by a lift in the stage, such as [[Kurt Angle]], [[David Heath (wrestler)|Gangrel]] and [[Rey Mysterio]]
* If a wrestler is a current champion, he will attempt to visually draw attention to his championship belt by either holding it high over his head or (if the belt is worn around the waist) moving his hands across it or pointing to it.
Another method of entry involves descending from the ceiling with a [[Zip-line]] or [[Abseiling|rappel line]] and stunt harness. This has been done by Shawn Michaels at [[WrestleMania XII]], by Sting many times in WCW and TNA, and has gained major controversy over its role in the death of wrestler [[Owen Hart]] at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]].

Special ring entrances are also developed for big occasions, most notably the [[WrestleMania]] event. For example, WrestleMania III and VI both saw all wrestlers enter the arena on motorized miniature wrestling rings. Live bands are sometimes hired to perform live entrance music at special events. [[John Cena]] and [[Triple H]] are particularly notable in recent years for their highly theatrical entrances at WrestleMania.

[[File:Evan Mathis and Dwayne Johnson.JPG|thumb|240px|Philadelphia Eagles' [[Evan Mathis]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson]]]]

=== Women's wrestling ===
{{see also|Women in WWE|Impact Knockouts}}
[[File:Cholita wrestling bolivia3 Joel Alvarez.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Fighting Cholitas]] in Bolivia]]
The women's division of professional wrestling has maintained a recognized world champion since 1937, when [[Mildred Burke]] won the original World Women's title. She then formed the World Women's Wrestling Association in the early 1950s and recognized herself as the first champion, although the championship would be vacated upon her retirement in 1956. The NWA however, ceased to acknowledge Burke as ''their'' Women's World champion in 1954, and instead acknowledged [[June Byers]] as champion after a controversial finish to a high-profile match between Burke and Byers that year. Upon Byers' retirement in 1964, [[The Fabulous Moolah]], who won a junior heavyweight version of the [[NWA World Women's Championship]] (the predecessor to the [[WWE Women's Championship]]) in a tournament back in 1958, was recognized by most NWA promoters as champion by default.

=== Intergender wrestling ===
For most of its history, men and women would rarely compete against each other in professional wrestling, as it was deemed to be unfair and unchivalrous. [[Andy Kaufman]] used this to gain notoriety when he created an Intergender Championship and declared it open to any female challenger. This led to a long (worked) feud with [[Jerry Lawler]].

In the 1980s, mixed tag team matches began to take place, with a male and female on each team and a rule stating that each wrestler could only attack the opponent of the same gender. If a tag was made, the other team had to automatically switch their legal wrestler as well. Despite these restrictions, many mixed tag matches do feature some physical interaction between participants of different genders. For example, a heel may take a cheap shot at the female wrestler of the opposing team to draw a negative crowd reaction. In lucha libre, cheap-shots and male-female attacks are not uncommon.&lt;ref name="SS1" /&gt;

[[Intergender wrestling|Intergender]] singles bouts were first fought on a national level in the 1990s. This began with [[Luna Vachon]], who faced men in ECW and WWF. Later, [[Chyna]] became the first female to hold a belt that was not exclusive to women when she won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]].  While it is a rare feat in WWE, in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]], [[ODB (wrestler)|ODB]] participates in singles intergender matches.  Also, ODB's kayfabe husband and tag team partner [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]] held the Knockouts tag team titles for a record 478 days before it was stripped by [[Brooke Hogan]] because Young was a male.

=== Midget wrestling ===
{{further|Midget wrestling}}
Midget wrestling can be traced to professional wrestling's carnival and vaudeville origins. In recent years, the popularity and prevalence of midgets in wrestling has greatly decreased due to wrestling companies depriving midget divisions of storyline or feud. However, WWE has made a few attempts to enter this market with their "minis" in the 1990s and the "junior's league" as recent as 2006. It is still a popular form of entertainment in Mexican wrestling, mostly as a "sideshow".

Some wrestlers may have their own specific "mini me", like [[Mascarita Sagrada]], Alebrije has Quije, etc. There are also cases in which midgets can become valets for a wrestler, and even get physically involved in matches, like [[KeMonito|Alushe]], who often accompanies [[Tinieblas]], or [[KeMonito]], who is portrayed as Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's mascot and is also a valet for Mistico. [[Dave Finlay]] was often aided in his matches by a midget known mainly as [[Hornswoggle]] while in WWE, who hid under the ring and gave a [[Shillelagh (club)|shillelagh]] to Finlay to use on his opponent. Finlay also occasionally threw him at his opponent(s). Hornswoggle has also been given a run with the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship]] and feuded with [[D-Generation X|D-X]] in 2009.

== Styles and characteristics in different countries ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
[[File:ALL JAPAN プロレス LOVE in Taiwan.jpg|thumb|250px|A match of All Japan Pro Wrestling in Taiwan, 2009]]
The U.S., Japan and Mexico are three countries where there is a huge market and high popularity for professional wrestling. But the styles of professional wrestling are different, given their independent development for a long period.

Professional wrestling in the U.S. tends to have a heavy focus on story building and the establishment of characters (and their personalities). There is a story for each match, and even a longer story for successive matches. The stories usually contain characters like [[face (professional wrestling)|faces]] and [[heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], and less often [[antihero]]es and tweeners. It is a "triumph" if the face wins, while it is a "tragedy" if the heel wins. The characters usually have strong and sharp personalities, with examples like [[Doink the Clown]], whose personality is melodramatic, slapstick and fantastical. The opposition between faces and heels is very intense in the story, and the heels may even attack the faces during TV interviews. The relationship between different characters can also be very complex.

[[File:Lucha libre — Arena México por Carlos Adampol 001.jpg|thumb|left|Mexican wrestler [[Andrade Cien Almas|La Sombra]] taking down opponent with a wrestling move]]
Although professional wrestling in Mexico ([[Lucha libre]]) also has stories and characters, they are less emphasized. Wrestlers in Mexico are traditionally more agile and perform more [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|aerial maneuvers]] than [[History of professional wrestling in the United States|professional wrestlers in the U.S.]] who, more often, rely on power moves and strikes to subdue their opponents.&lt;ref name="SS1" /&gt; The difference in styles is due to the independent evolution of the sport in Mexico beginning in the 1930s and the fact that wrestlers in the [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight]] division ({{Lang-es|italics=yes|peso semicompleto}}) are often the most popular wrestlers in Mexican lucha libre. Wrestlers often execute high flying moves characteristic of lucha libre by utilizing the [[wrestling ring]]'s ropes to catapult themselves towards their opponents, using intricate combinations in rapid-fire succession, and applying complex submission holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2006/06/17/1638198.html|title=CANOE - SLAM! Sports - Wrestling - Lucha Libre 101|publisher=Slam.canoe.ca|accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucha libre is also known for its [[tag team]] wrestling matches, in which the teams are often made up of three members, instead of two as is common in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stas|last=Bekman|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/sports/pro-wrestling/8-6-Lucha-Libre-confuses-me-what-are-the-rules.html|title=8.6. Lucha Libre confuses me, what are the rules?|publisher=Stason.org|accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of Japanese professional wrestling ([[puroresu]]) is again different. With its origins in traditional American style of wrestling and still being under the same genre, it has become an entity in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Sports/Wrestling/Professional/Puroresu/desc.html|title=Open Directory category description|publisher=Open Directory|year=1995|accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the similarity to its American counterpart in that the outcome of the matches remains predetermined, the phenomena are different in the form of the [[sport psychology|psychology]] and presentation of the sport. In most of the largest promotions, such as [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]], [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]], it is treated as a [[Contact sport#Full-contact sport|full contact]] [[combat sport]] as it mixes hard hitting [[martial arts]] strikes with [[Shoot wrestling#Shoot-style|shoot style]] [[Submission (combat sports)|submission holds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresu.com/intro.html|title=Puroresu Dojo Introduction|publisher=Puroresu.com|year= 1995|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the U.S. it is rather more regarded as an entertainment show. Wrestlers incorporate kicks and strikes from [[martial arts]] disciplines, and a strong emphasis is placed on [[submission wrestling]], and unlike the use of involved storylines in the U.S., they are not as intricate in Japan, more emphasis is placed on the concept of "fighting spirit", meaning the wrestlers display of physical and mental stamina are valued a lot more than theatrics. Many of Japan's wrestlers including top stars such as [[Shinya Hashimoto]], [[Riki Chōshū]] and [[Keiji Mutoh]] came from a legitimate martial arts background and many Japanese wrestlers in the 1990s began to pursue careers in mixed martial arts organizations such as Pancrase and Shooto which at the time retained the original look of puroresu but were actual competitions. Other companies, such as Michinoku Pro Wrestling and [[Dragon Gate]], wrestle in a style similar to Mexican companies like AAA and CMLL. This is known as "Lucharesu".

== Culture ==
[[File:Frank-gotch.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Frank Gotch]], 20th century professional wrestler]]
Professional wrestling has developed its own cultures, both internal and external.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Those involved in producing professional wrestling have developed a kind of global [[Secret society|fraternity]], with familial bonds, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|shared language]] and passed-down traditions. New performers are expected to "pay their dues" for a few years by working in lower-profile promotions and working as ring crew before working their way upward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grabianowski|first=Ed|title=Wrestling School|work=How Professional Wrestling Works| publisher=HowStuffWorks.com|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling5.htm|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Derek|title=Discovery: Accidental Perfection|publisher=The Wrestling Oratory|date=2007-08-11|url=http://oratory.rajah.com/index.php?archive=3281|quote="Dragon Gate is a unique promotion as they still follow many of wrestling's biggest traditions, one being that veterans get theirs first because rookies need to "pay their dues" like they did."|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411141859/http://oratory.rajah.com/index.php?archive=3281|archivedate=2008-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permanent rosters of most promotions develop a backstage [[pecking order]], with veterans mediating conflicts and mentoring younger wrestlers.&lt;ref name="Unions"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gadd|first=Mitchell|title=Unions|work=Reading Between the Ropes|publisher=WrestleZone.com|date=2006-07-13|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/column.php?articleid=154797119|accessdate=2008-03-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412003958/http://www.wrestlezone.com/column.php?articleid=154797119|archivedate=2008-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many decades (and still to a lesser extent today) performers were expected to keep the illusions of wrestling's legitimacy alive even while not performing, essentially acting in character any time they were in public.&lt;ref name="Kreit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kreit|first=Alex|title=Professional Wrestling and Its Fans: A Sociological Study of the Sport of Pro-Wrestling|work=Solie's Vintage Wrestling|publisher=Jump City Productions|year=1998|url=http://www.solie.org/articles/pwandfans.html|accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some veterans speak of a "sickness" among wrestling performers, an inexplicable pull to remain active in the wrestling world despite the devastating effects the job can have on one's life and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Kamchen|first=Richard|title=Retro review: Piper's tale scrappy as he is|work=SLAM!

Fans of professional wrestling have their own subculture, comparable to [[fandom|those of science fiction, video games, or comic books]]. Those who are interested in the backstage occurrences, future storylines and reasonings behind company decisions read newsletters written by journalists with inside ties to the wrestling industry.&lt;ref name="Kreit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipscomb"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipscomb|first=William|title=The Operational Aesthetic in the Performance of Professional Wrestling|publisher=Department of Communications Studies, Louisiana State University|date=May 2005|url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-01252005-152153/unrestricted/Lipscomb__III_dis.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324222906/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-01252005-152153/unrestricted/Lipscomb__III_dis.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "rags" or "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dirt sheet|dirt sheet]]s" have expanded into the Internet, where their information can be dispensed on an up-to-the-minute basis. Some have expanded into [[radio]] shows.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Some fans enjoy a pastime of collecting tapes of wrestling shows from specific companies, of certain wrestlers, or of specific genres. The internet has given fans exposure to worldwide variations of wrestling they would be unable to see otherwise.&lt;ref name="Bollom"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bollom|first=Brandon W.|title=Professional Wrestling Migration: Puroresu in America|date=2004-05-07|url=http://www.burninghammer.com/academic/puroresu.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409100045/http://www.burninghammer.com/academic/puroresu.pdf|archive-date=2008-04-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, many companies have been founded which deal primarily in wrestling footage. When the WWE purchased both WCW and ECW in 2001, they also obtained the entire past video libraries of both productions and have released many past matches online and on home video.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Like some other sports, [[Fantasy sport|fantasy league]]s have developed around professional wrestling. Some take this concept further by creating [[Fantasy wrestling|E-fed]]s (electronic federations), where a user can create their own fictional wrestling character, and [[role-playing]] storylines with other users, leading to scheduled "shows" where match results are determined by the organizers, usually based on a combination of the characters' statistics and the players' roleplaying aptitude, sometimes with audience voting.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Professional wrestling in mainstream culture ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
From the first established world championship, the top professional wrestlers have garnered fame within mainstream society. Each successive generation has produced a number of wrestlers who extend their careers into the realms of music, acting, writing, business, politics or public speaking, and are known to those who are unfamiliar with wrestling in general. Conversely, celebrities from other sports or general pop culture also become involved with wrestling for brief periods of time. A prime example of this is [[1980s professional wrestling boom|The Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]] of the 1980s, which combined wrestling with [[MTV]].

[[File:US Navy 050519-N-7130B-003 Professional wrestling champion and actor Bill Goldberg takes a moment to pose with the photographers of Operations Department^rsquo,s OP Division during his tour of USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76).jpg|thumb|[[Bill Goldberg]] during his tour of [[USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76)|USS ''Ronald Reagan'']]]]
Professional wrestling is often portrayed within other works using parody, and its general elements have become familiar [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s and [[Internet meme|meme]]s in American culture.

Some terminology originating in professional wrestling has found its way into the common vernacular. Phrases such as "body slam", "sleeper hold" and "tag team" are used by those who do not follow professional wrestling. The term "smackdown", popularized by [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' in the 1990s, has been included in [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionaries since 2007.

Many television shows and films have been produced which portray in-character professional wrestlers as protagonists, such as ''[[Ready to Rumble]]'', ''[[¡Mucha Lucha!]]'', ''[[Nacho Libre]]'', and the Santo film series. At least two stage plays set in the world of pro wrestling have been produced: ''The Baron'' is a comedy that retells the life of an actual performer known as [[James Raschke|Baron von Raschke]]. ''From Parts Unknown...'' is an award-nominated Canadian drama about the rise and fall of a fictional wrestler. The 2009 ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[W.T.F. (South Park)|W.T.F.]]" played on the soap operatic elements of professional wrestling. One of the lead characters on the Disney Channel series ''[[Kim Possible]]'' was a huge fan of pro wrestling and actually featured it on an episode (with two former WWE wrestlers voicing the two fictitious wrestlers featured in the episode). The 2008 film ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]'', about a washed-up professional wrestler, garnered several Oscar nominations.

The 1950 [[film noir]] [[Night and the City]], directed by [[Jules Dassin]] and starring [[Richard Widmark]] and [[Gene Tierney]], told the story of a promoter in [[London]] trying to make it big, and featured a match involving real professional wrestler [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]].

=== Study and analysis of professional wrestling ===
With its growing popularity, professional wrestling has attracted attention as a subject of serious [[Academia|academic]] study and [[Journalism|journalistic]] criticism.

But this was not always the case; in the early 20th century, once it became apparent that the "sport" was worked, pro wrestling was looked down on as a cheap entertainment for the uneducated working class&lt;ref name="Kreit"/&gt;—an attitude that still exists to varying degrees today.&lt;ref name="Lipscomb"/&gt; The French theorist [[Roland Barthes]] was among the first to propose that wrestling was worthy of deeper analysis, in his essay "The World of Wrestling" from his book ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', first published in 1957.&lt;ref name="Barthes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=The World Of Wrestling|work=Mythologies|year=1957|url= http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/illustex/Barthes-wrestling.htm|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kreit"/&gt; Barthes argued that it should be looked at not as a scamming of the ignorant, but as [[spectacle]]; a mode of theatric performance for a willing, if bloodthirsty, audience. Wrestling is described as performed art which demands an immediate reading of the juxtaposed meanings. The logical conclusion is given least importance over the theatrical performers of the wrestlers and the referee. According to Barthes the function of a wrestler is not to win: it is to go exactly through the motions which are expected of him and to give the audience a theatrical spectacle. This work is considered a foundation of all later study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lagorio|first=Christine|title=Wrestling With The Margins|work= Education Supplement 2005|publisher=The Village Voice|date=2005-01-04|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/0502,lagorio,59937,12.html|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Documentary film|Documentary]] [[Film director|filmmakers]] have studied the lives of wrestlers and the effects the profession has on them and their families. The 1999 theatrical documentary ''[[Beyond the Mat]]'' focused on [[Terry Funk]], a wrestler nearing [[retirement]]; [[Mick Foley]], a wrestler within his prime; [[Jake Roberts]], a former star fallen from grace; and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#School|a school of wrestling student]] trying to break into the business. The 2005 release ''[[Lipstick and Dynamite, Piss and Vinegar: The First Ladies of Wrestling]]'' chronicled the development of women's wrestling throughout the 20th century. Pro wrestling has been featured several times on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]''. MTV's documentary series ''[[True Life]]'' featured two episodes titled "I'm a Professional Wrestler" and "I Want to Be a Professional Wrestler". Other documentaries have been produced by [[TLC (TV channel)|The Learning Channel]] (''The Secret World of Professional Wrestling'') and [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] (''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]''). [[Bloodstained Memoirs]] explored the careers of several pro wrestlers, including [[Chris Jericho]], [[Rob Van Dam]] and [[Roddy Piper]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

A '''resistant reading''' is a reading of a text which moves beyond the dominant cultural beliefs to challenge prevailing views. It means to read a text as it was not meant to be read; in fact reading the text against itself.

==Textual example==
By way of illustration, consider [[Andrew Marvell]]'s poem [[To His Coy Mistress]].

A resistant reading may develop from an alternative reading, pointing out how the [[representation (arts)|representation]] of [[gender]] in the poem furthers the notion of gender as [[binary opposition]]s, the male is active and powerful, the female is passive and marginalized. As such, it will be read by readers who share [[feminist]] views of the world as [[gender inequality]] and discrimination against women. For example, Marvell's representation of [[heterosexuality]] in the poem may be read as being exploitative, based as it is on the persona psychologically terrorizing the woman. Marvell depicts his persona as attempting to have the woman submit as a result of the fear he seeks to instill within her; Marvell's vivid and confronting [[image]]ry is most significant and not accidental:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound / My echoing song: then worms shall try / That long preserved [[virginity]]...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Importance==
Resistant reading is an important element of our critical and interpretive repertoire. It is worth considering whether [[diegesis|diegetic]] border crossing always strengthens the potential for resistant reading (as might seem intuitively likely, given that readers are moving in and out of the story), or whether on some occasions it might trigger the reverse effect.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Literacy Research,  Spring 2003  by Mackey, Margaret&lt;/ref&gt;

The aims of the '''Royal Society of Miniature Painters, Sculptors and Gravers'''  are ''to esteem, protect and practice the traditional 16th Century art of miniature painting emphasising the infinite patience needed for its fine techniques.'' Its patron is [[Charles, Prince of Wales]].

The Society of Miniature Painters was founded in May 1896 by [[Alyn Williams]], (1865-25th July, 1941), in which year it had its inaugural exhibition in the [[Modern Gallery, London|Modern Gallery]], 175 New Bond Street, London, and is devoted exclusively to contemporary [[portrait miniature|miniature paintings]]. 

[[King Edward VII]] granted the society a [[Royal Charter]] on 30 May 1904, and it became the Royal Miniature Society or RMS. To highlight the Society's growing importance the President's Jewel was commissioned in 1920. This is a large, elaborate silver chain of office designed and made by Alfred Lyndhurst Pocock, (1881-1962), which is still worn by the current president at formal functions. In 1926 the Society's scope was extended to include sculptors and [[Engraving|graver]]s and its name was changed by the Royal Command of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. The Society's Gold Memorial Bowl Award was established in 1985 and is one of the highest accolades for miniature art in the world. Since its foundation the Society has had eight different Presidents (Alyn Williams was president twice, 1896-1898, 1908-1941), including Sir [[William Blake Richmond]] (1842-1921) and [[Raymond Lister]] (1919-2001). The RMS's annual exhibition of around 650 works is held each October at the [[Mall Galleries]] in London. When the Society was founded the maximum size for a miniature was 12 by 10 inches - today the permitted size, including the frame, is 6 by 4.5 inches (15 x 11.5cm). Elizabeth R Meek, MBE (born 1953), who held the post of president between 2004-2013 and is now the Society's Honorary President, describes working in miniature as the most demanding of all painting genre. She names some of the qualities required as: "Concentration, stillness of mind and body and a dogged perseverance for perfection - the perfect miniature needs to be devoid of errors."

The Society's 122st Annual Exhibition will be held between 28 November and 9 December 2018 at the Mall Galleries, The Mall, London, SW1. There will be around 600 works on view, and while the traditional subject matter of portraiture continues unabated, there will be a very broad range of subject matter, including landscapes, still lifes and wildlife.

The '''Sheffield Repertory Theatre''' was a [[theatre company]] in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]].

Herbert Prince, a railway clerk, founded the amateur dramatics society in 1919,&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;Frank Long "Sheffield" in Colin Chambers ''Twentieth Century Theatre'', London: Continuum, 2002, p.687&lt;/ref&gt; a first meeting is recorded at the Oxford Street Settlement in Shipton Street that year, which became the Sheffield Repertory Theatre in 1923. A meeting in October 1923 formed an Executive Committee for a professional Company, consisting of Wilfred Vickers, W.C. Landon, C.V. McNally, A. Ballard, H.W. d. Harkcom and [[Herbert M. Prentice]]. The subscription was 3 [[shilling]]s and [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]].

At the first Annual Meeting in January 1924, the aims were formulated:
#To promote and encourage interest in the Drama and kindred Arts.
#To produce Plays
#To arrange lectures, recitals, play-readings and discussions
#To promote social intercourse amongst the members
#To form a library of dramatuc literature for the use of members
#The establishment of a permanent Repertory Theatre in Sheffield

Their first performances took place at the Little Theatre in Shipton Street. Later the Company hired the South Street Schoolroom in Eldon Street. In 1928 the Company gained a permanent venue,&lt;ref name="Long"/&gt; and moved to the former Temperance Hall, in Townhead Street. The seating of this new Repertory Theatre was 319 in the saloon (Stalls) and 222 in the Balcony.

With the outbreak of war in 1939, the theatre was closed, along with nearly all British theatres by a government fearful of German bombing and consequent mass loss of life in such public buildings. This closure led to a most bizarre period. In order to resolve the financial crisis the Company arranged to reform in Southport, a de-restricted area, and carry on the business there. Despite the government allowing the theatre in Sheffield to re-open by 1940, a binding contract had already been signed in Southport. It thus proved impractical to operate in both towns and the decision was taken that the Company should remain in Southport. Over 240 productions took place in the [[Lancashire]] resort by a Yorkshire repertory during the war. The building in Townhead Street was eventually hired out for storage.

At the end of the war, the Company was able to return to its natural home, although it owed a debt to Southport for its survival. The theatre was in a dishevelled condition, following its utilitarian usage during the war, but the Company, helped by willing volunteers successfully renovated the auditorium in 1945, allowing it to re-open to the theatre-going public, with the appropriately titled play, ''The Peaceful Inn''.

By 1951, the theatre was a cultural and financial success. Most patrons bought season tickets, and so would attend every new performance. Sheffield was one of the few regional theatres to adopt a fortnightly cycle of plays. This was generally accepted to provide a much higher quality of performance; most repertory changed weekly. Plays running the gamut from Shakespeare to interpretations of the latest 'West End Smash' would alternate throughout the year. The festive season saw not a '[[Pantomime|Panto]]' but a play designed to appeal to children, that would nonetheless cultivate their minds.

By 1953 the theatre was struggling to cope with its success. The building failed to meet increasing health and safety demands. The management took the decision to completely rebuild it. Stripped back to its bare walls, the interior was entirely renewed as a sleek 'Fifties' auditorium replaced the stippled decor of the out-dated theatre. The Company had become so successful in the ensuing eight years since the war, that £20,000 could be invested in the internal rebuild of the premises.

In March 1954, the theatre re-opened and its success continued unabated, under the leadership of Geoffrey Ost, who had been the director since 1938, a service broken only by his wartime call-up. In 1959 Ost was awarded an honorary Doctorate at the University (a Scholarship still exists under his name). The future acting stars who were members of the Company include [[Peter Sallis]], [[Patrick McGoohan]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Paul Eddington]], [[Keith Barron]] and Sir [[Nigel Hawthorne]]. Actors such as Sir [[Alec Guinness]] and [[Patrick Macnee]] also performed in individually contracted productions and Sir [[Donald Wolfit]] was an assistant stage manager there. However Sheffield Rep. was really all about the local community - it only survived and prospered because many local people gave their labour and support on a voluntary or semi-professional basis, although plenty of local paid work was also provided.

The company was identified as a significant repertory company in the UK by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] during the 1960s, and a trust was formed to oversee the construction of a new building.&lt;ref name="Hartnoll"&gt;Phyllis Hartnoll (ed) ''The Oxford Companion to the Theatre'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Crucible Theatre]] replaced the old theatre in 1971 financed by the Arts Council, Sheffield City Council and public donations.&lt;ref name="Hartnoll"/&gt; Geoffrey Ost was still there, noted as 'General Advisor'.

[[File:Exhibition Suiseki and Shangshi Prague 2011 2257.jpg|thumb|Suiseki and its wooden base at "Exhibition Suiseki and Shangshi" in Prague, 2011]]

{{nihongo|'''Suiseki'''|水石}} are small naturally occurring or shaped [[rock (geology)|rocks]] which are traditionally appreciated.  They are similar to [[Chinese scholar's rocks]].&lt;ref name="cousins244"&gt;Cousins, Craig. (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=7w-arIGpmfEC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=  ''Bonsai Master Class,'' p. 244].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chinese scholar's rocks influenced the development of ''suiseki'' in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Brokaw, Charles. (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=T51TNiU9460C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=  ''The Temple Mount Code,'' p. 73].&lt;/ref&gt;  The history of ''suiseki'' in Japan begins during the reign of [[Empress Suiko]].  The small objects were brought to Japan as gifts from the Chinese Imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;Corvello, Vincent T. and Yūji Yoshimura. (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=o-87ZrlXIzAC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq= ''The Japanese Art of Stone Appreciation: Suiseki and Its Use With Bonsai,'' p. 17].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Suiseki'' are usually presented in two different ways:

*The stone is provided with a wooden base (Daiza).
*The stone is placed in a waterproof tray or bowl of ceramic (suiban) or bronze (Doban).

These stones are not just any stones which can be found in nature; they must be expressive stones and have a special shape, color and texture to be categorized as ''suiseki''. There is a distinction between landscape and object stones. The former reflect landscapes such as mountains, lakes or rivers, while other stones have object shapes that resemble animals or sculptures.

The stones are of natural origin and are found in rivers, oceans and karst areas. They are not allowed to be reshaped. An exception is the cutting of stones to have a flat base, so they can be placed stably on a Daiza, suiban or Doban, to be displayed properly. This diminishes their value, in the eyes of purists.

==Evaluation==
The evaluation of ''suiseki'' recognizes subtlety of color, shape, markings and surface.  According to {{nihongo|Hideo Marushima|丸島秀夫|Marushima Hideo|1934-&amp;nbsp;}} in {{nihongo| ''The History of Suiseki in Japan''|日本愛石史|Nihon aisekishi|}},
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not a silly thing at all to enjoy a stone in a tray. I see the whole world in a tiny stone. Some objects in this world are huge, and others are small, and they come in all shapes, but they are not that different when you look at their essence.&lt;ref&gt;Rivera, Felix G. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vgr2MAYajMIC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=  ''Suiseki: The Japanese Art of Miniature Landscape Stones,'' p. 40], citing {{nihongo|''The History of Suiseki in Japan''|日本愛石史|Nihon aisekishi}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Popular types of ''suiseki'' suggest a mountain, a waterfall, an island, a thatched hut or an animal.&lt;ref name="cousins244"/&gt;

'''''Synth''''' is an [[Action game|action]] [[real-time strategy]] [[video game]] by Canadian developer [[Rhys Paul Hovey]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]. ''Synth'' is an abstract and procedurally generated [[3D computer graphics|3D]] game, in which the graphics have an algorithmic [[C++]] representation.

==Gameplay==
''Synth'' is a [[strategy video game|strategic]] [[action game]], in which the player must find an exit in a [[procedural generation|procedurally generated]] landscape. The player is equipped with a laser, bombs, and a device that acts as a vacuum or blower. The overall goal is to reach the highest level possible.&lt;ref name="gamasutra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=23130|title=Interview: The Secrets of SYNTH, 'Weirdest Video Game Ever Created'|date=April 14, 2009|work=Gamasutra|author=Ciolek, Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Synth'' uses C++ algorithms to generate the level's structure and graphics. Levels are [[Random seed|seeded]] from four-letter words: for example, "BGNI" is the first level.&lt;ref name="gamasutra"/&gt; As the game does not need to store pre-rendered textures and model data, only small [[filesize]]s are required.&lt;ref name="rps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/03/30/synth-maths-in-action/|title=SYNTH: Maths in Action|work=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|author=Meer, Alec|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Synth''{{'}}s [[drum and bass]] [[synthesizer]] soundtrack dynamically changes during the game. The sounds were pre-composed by Hovey, but the player's controls are mapped to a loop-sequence [[remixer]].&lt;ref name="gamasutra"/&gt;

==Development==
[[Image:Synth video game screenshot B.png|250px|right]]
Hovey cites the artwork of [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]] (who produced the covers for several [[Psygnosis]] titles), other [[Amiga]] graphics, and [[Pink Floyd]] as influences for ''Synth'' imagery.&lt;ref name="gamasutra"/&gt;

''Synth'' is currently only available as a [[game demo]]. Once a full version is ready, Hovey intends to acquire a digital distribution deal.&lt;ref name="gamasutra"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Todd Ciolek, an editor with [[Gamasutra]] made reference to the games experimental design: "Rhys Paul Hovey’s SYNTH is an experimental game in many ways".&lt;ref name="gamasutra"/&gt; [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] drew comparisons with the visuals of [[Darwinia (video game)|Darwinia]] and the procedural nature of [[.kkrieger]]. The graphics were described as fascinating: "a bizarre, mesmerizing cross between the deeply archaic and the thoroughly high-tech."&lt;ref name="rps"/&gt; [[ModDB]] reviewed version 0.909 and praised the game's concept, describing the visuals as "crazy 3D [[Geometry Wars]] on acid". Criticisms included the poor [[frame rate]], incomplete [[Windows Vista editions#64-bit versions|Vista 64-bit]] support and lack of a windowed mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://www.moddb.com/games/synthtm/features/modcast-s02-e11|title=Modcast|website=ModDB|date=2009-02-02|accessdate=2009-08-05|time=16:15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, SYNTH:Electropix 64 bit version 1.505, won 1st place in the Intel corporation's "Level up" 2010 game demo contest, in the "Best game for a desktop" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2010/11/30/congratulations-to-the-winners-in-the-professional-category-of-level-up-2010/|title=Congratulations to the winners in the professional category of Level Up 2010!|work=Intel Software Network|author=Lowry, Kelly|date=November 30, 2010|accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hovey used the user name Paul Richard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://software.intel.com/file/30831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3509">'''The Bear''' is a [[fairy tale]] collected by [[Andrew Lang]] in ''[[The Grey Fairy Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Grey Fairy Book'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/donkeyskin/stories/bear.html "The Bear"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Aarne-Thompson classification system]] type 510B, unnatural love.  Others of this type include [[Cap O' Rushes]], [[Catskin]], [[Little Cat Skin]], [[Allerleirauh]], [[The King who Wished to Marry His Daughter]], [[The She-Bear]], [[Tattercoats]], [[Mossycoat]], [[The Princess That Wore A Rabbit-Skin Dress]], and [[Donkeyskin]], or the legend of [[Saint Dymphna]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/donkeyskin/other.html Tales Similar to Donkeyskin]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Maria Tatar, p 213, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A king loved his daughter so much that he kept her in her rooms for fear harm would come to her.  She complained to her nurse; unbeknownst to her, the nurse was a witch. She told her to get a wheelbarrow and a bearskin from the king. The king gave them to her, the nurse enchanted them, and when the princess put on the skin, it disguised her, and when she got into the wheelbarrow, it took her wherever she wanted to go. She had it take her to a forest.

A prince hunted her, but when she called to him to call off his dogs, he was so astounded that he asked her to come home with him. She agreed and went in the wheelbarrow. His mother was surprised, and more when the bear began to do housework as well as any servant. One day, the prince had to go to a ball given by a neighbouring prince. The bear wanted to go, and he kicked it.  When he left, she implored his mother for leave to just go and watch. With it, she went to her wheelbarrow and used the wand to turn her bearskin into a ballgown of moon-beams. At the ball, the prince fell in love with her, but she fled, so she would be back in time to hide herself. She was pleased when he told his mother of her, because she had fooled him, and laughed under the table.  The second ball, she went in a gown of sunlight, and his attempts to follow her carriage did not succeed.

The [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] time, the prince succeeded in getting a ring on her finger.  When he went home, he declared he would search for her.  First, he wanted some soup, and for the bear to have nothing to do with it, because every time he mentioned his love, the bear muttered and laughed.  The bear put the ring in the soup.  The prince asked her to take off the skin, and she became a [[attractiveness|beautiful]] young woman.  She told the prince and his mother how her father had kept her imprisoned, and the prince married her.

==Commentary==
This is an unusual variant of this tale as commonly, the heroine flees the threat of enforced marriage to her own father, as in Allerleirauh, The She-Bear, Donkeyskin, and The King who Wished to Marry His Daughter,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; or the legend of [[Saint Dymphna]]. Other tales where the heroine has another motive include [[Catskin]], where she flees being married off to the first man, Cap O' Rushes where her father interpreted her words to mean she did not love him, and [[The Child who came from an Egg]], whose (apparent) father had been conquered by another army.

{{nihongo|'''Tomoko Matsunashi'''|松梨 智子|Matsunashi Tomoko}} is a Japanese [[film director]] and [[actress]]. She was described in 2007 as one of the female Japanese directors who "have brought some needed originality and talent to contemporary Japanese cinema."&lt;ref name="redsiglo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redsiglo21.com/eiga9/japanesecinemanews.html|title=JAPANESE CINEMA NEWS 2007 - 18/11/07|publisher=[redsiglo21.com]|accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Tomoko Matsunashi was born in [[Hiroshima]], Japan on April 14, 1971.&lt;ref name="synoptique"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.synoptique.ca/core/en/articles/rist_matsunashi|title=The Way of the (Female) Director|publisher=[www.synoptique.ca]|accessdate=2009-09-12|last=Rist|first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; She says she was interested in the theatre and wanted to be an actor from the time she was in elementary school. She attended [[Waseda University]] and although she studied business, she became part of an independent theatre group while at school.&lt;ref name="offscreen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offscreen.com/biblio/phile/essays/tomoko_matsunashi/|title=Tomoko Matsunashi: The Way of the Interview |publisher=[Offscreen]|accessdate=2009-09-12|last=Rist|first=Peter|date=August 31, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also became interested in film at that time and after graduation appeared as an actress in a film directed by one of the group's members which won the audience award at the Pia Film Festival. When the director left the group, Matsunashi decided to make her own films though she had no formal training in cinema.&lt;ref name="offscreen"/&gt; Her first film, the 1995 short, ''To Be or Not to Be'', which she wrote, directed and acted in, won an Encouragement Prize in the Off Theater Competition at the 1996 [[Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yubarifanta.com/index_pc.php?ct=archive.php&amp;langue=21002|title=Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival Archive '96|publisher=[yubarifanta.com]|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matsunashi appeared as an actress in the March 1996 release ''Tokiwa: The Manga Apartment'' directed by [[Jun Ichikawa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117933/|title=Tokiwa-so no seishun|publisher=[IMDb]|accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also in one of director [[Noboru Iguchi]]'s early movies, ''Kurushime-san'', which was first released in 1997. Iguchi's film won the Encouragement Prize at the 1998 [[Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinema.intercritique.com/movie.cgi?mid=12586|script-title=ja:クルシメさん (1997/日)|accessdate=2009-09-09|publisher=CinemaScape]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/betty/boop/kurushimesan.htm|script-title=ja:クルシメさん|accessdate=2009-09-09|publisher=[www.ne.jp/asahi]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 she was the companion and co-star of [[Katsuyuki Hirano]] in the second of his trilogy of bike-ride documentary movies ''Encyclopedia of a Drifter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1998/dv001350.htm|script-title=ja:流れ者図鑑|publisher=[JMDB]|accessdate=2009-09-06|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0794318/|title=Nagaremono zukan (1998)|publisher=[IMdB]|accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third movie in his trilogy, ''Shiro - The White'' from 1999, involved a hazardous solo trip to northern [[Hokkaido]] in a winter blizzard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105054724/http://www.cinema-r.com/program/backNumber/b20060415_04.html|archivedate=2007-11-05|url=http://www.cinema-r.com/program/backNumber/b20060415_04.html|script-title=ja:由美香|publisher=[www.cinema-r.com]|accessdate=2009-09-06|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matsunashi also continued directing and another of her early films, ''Bitch Matilda'' (1998), garnered her a nomination for the New Director's Award from the [[Directors Guild of Japan]].&lt;ref name="synoptique"/&gt; Her next film, ''SABU, Goodbye to their Youth'' from 2000, was a mixture of science fiction and politics and was an early attempt by Matsunashi at a comic portrayal of young men from a woman's perspective. The film was shown theatrically in Osaka and Tokyo and at the [[TromaDance]] Film Festival in 2002.&lt;ref name="synoptique"/&gt;&lt;ref name="offscreen"/&gt; Matsunashi's next feature (from 2002) was ''Replicant Joe'', with another science fiction-fantasy theme where the title character becomes a robot with a rocket-launcher arm and a small woolen penis.&lt;ref name="synoptique"/&gt;

International recognition came to Matsunashi with her 2005 film ''The Way of the Director''&lt;ref name="redsiglo"/&gt; which was shown at the [[Fantasia Festival]] in [[Montreal]] in July 2005 and at the Camera Japan festival in [[Rotterdam]] in June 2006.&lt;ref name="offscreen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camerajapan.nl/2006/schedules_03.html|title=Camera Japan|publisher=[www.camerajapan.nl]|accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matsunashi has said that all her films "are based on my own previous experiences with my ex-boyfriends" and ''The Way of the Director'' is centered around two characters Saito and Kitagawa who both aspire to be directors. Saito makes a name for herself in independent films but Kitagawa is persuaded by a friend to become a porn director though he still dreams of going legitimate. Meeting Saito again after ten years, Kitagawa gets the idea of filming a trek to northern Hokkaido in winter with Saito. When things go wrong and Saito dies, Kitagawa eats her flesh to survive but eventually succumbs as well. A friend rescues his film footage and Kitagawa finally becomes a mainstream director.&lt;ref name="offscreen"/&gt;

In November 2007, Matsunashi announced the shooting of her next film, ''Happy Darts'', and asked Japanese darts fans to collaborate in its making.&lt;ref name="redsiglo"/&gt; The comedy, released theatrically in Japan in November 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1148169/|title=Happy Darts |publisher=[IMDb]|accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=331626|script-title=ja:Ｈａｐｐｙダーツ|publisher=[AllCinema]|accessdate=2010-07-07|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerns an office lady whose humdrum life is changed when she attempts to win a national darts competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nipponcinema.com/blog/are-you-ready-for-a-darts-training-montage-here-comes-happy-darts/|title=Are you ready for a darts training montage?

'''Vgo''', or '''Ugo''', for "Hugues", was a [[stonemason]] active in [[Provence]] during the twelfth century. He left his signature on several [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] religious edifices in Provence and mainly in [[Tricastin]]:

* [[Vaison Cathedral]]
* Notre Dame d'[[Aubune]]
* St Blaise de [[Bauzon]]
* St Sepulchre Chapel in [[Beaumont-du-Ventoux|Beaumont]]
* Crypt of [[Apt Cathedral]]

He is not to be confused with [[Master Hugo]], an English artist of the same century.

The '''Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition''' or '''shaft tomb culture''' refers to a set of interlocked cultural traits found in the western [[Mexican states]] of [[Jalisco]], [[Nayarit]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Colima]] to its south, roughly dating to the period between 300 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 400 [[Common Era|CE]], although there is not wide agreement on this end-date.  Nearly all of the artifacts associated with this shaft tomb tradition have been discovered by looters and are without [[provenance]], making dating problematic.&lt;ref&gt;The International Council of Museum estimates that 90% of the clay figurines come from illegal excavations [http://icom.museum/redlist/LatinAmerica/english/page04.htm ICOM] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506134137/http://icom.museum/redlist/LatinAmerica/english/page04.htm |date=2008-05-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first major undisturbed shaft tomb associated with the tradition was not discovered until 1993, at Huitzilapa, Jalisco.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page] as well as Danien, p. 23.  There is some evidence (Meighan &amp; Nicholson, p. 42) that many tombs were looted in ancient times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally regarded as of [[Purépecha culture|Purépecha]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;Judy Sund, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_4_82/ai_69411773/pg_13 p. 13].&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary with the [[Aztec]]s, it became apparent in the middle of the 20th century, as a result of further research, that the artifacts and tombs were instead over 1000 years older.  Until recently, the looted artifacts were all that was known of the people and culture or cultures that created the shaft tombs.  So little was known, in fact, that a major 1998 exhibition highlighting these artifacts was subtitled: "Art and Archaeology of the Unknown Past".&lt;ref&gt;See Townsend, Richard (1998) ''Ancient West Mexico: Art and Archaeology of the Unknown Past'', Thames &amp; Hudson. &lt;br&gt; Also, in the fourth edition of his ''Mexico: from the Olmecs to the Aztecs'', [[Michael Coe]] talks about "our abysmal ignorance of the prehistory of the area", p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now thought that, although shaft tombs are widely diffused across the area, the region was not a unified [[cultural area]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' says, for example, that "At no time in the pre-Hispanic era did any political or cultural entity impose itself on the whole region, even though certain cultural patterns (such as the building of shaft-and-chamber tombs) have in fact been widely diffused", Michelet p. 328.  Beekman (2000, p.  393) makes the same argument.&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeologists, however, still struggle with identifying and naming the ancient western Mexico cultures of this period.

==Description==
[[File:Ancient Western Mexico Archaeological Sites.svg|350px|thumb|Western Mexico archaeological sites. The orange circles show archaeological sites. The larger green circles highlight the most important sites. Note that the sites form what has been called the "shaft tomb arc" which extends from northwest Nayarit through the central Jalisco highlands and down to Colima.]]

The shaft tomb tradition is thought to have developed around 300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page] and most other sources give the 300 BCE date.  For example, Dominique Michelet in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' says "it probably started earlier" than 200 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Some shaft tombs predate the tradition by more than 1000 years – for example, the shaft tomb at [[El Opeño]] in [[Michoacán]] has been dated to 1500 BCE but is linked to Central, rather than Western, Mexico.  Like much else concerning the tradition, its origins are not well understood, although the valleys around [[Tequila, Jalisco]], which include the archaeological sites of Huitzilapa and Teuchitlan, constitute its "undisputed core".&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (2000) p. 388 &amp; 394.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tradition lasted until at least 300 CE although there is not wide agreement on the end date.&lt;ref&gt;The proposed end date of the shaft tomb tradition varies considerably.  Williams as well as the [[De Young Museum]] give a date of 300 CE.  The International Council of Museums, on the other hand, provides a date of 500 CE, while the Smithsonian and ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' give 600 CE.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western Mexico [[shaft tomb]]s are characterized by a vertical or nearly vertical shaft, dug 3 to 20 metres down into what is often underlying volcanic [[tuff]].  The base of the shaft opens into one or two (occasionally more) horizontal chambers, perhaps 4 by 4 metres (varying considerably), with a low ceiling.  The shaft tombs were often associated with an overlying building.

Multiple burials are found in each chamber and evidence indicates that the tombs were used for families or lineages over time.&lt;ref&gt;Coe et al., p. 102.&lt;br&gt; Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page].&lt;/ref&gt;  The labor involved in the creation of the shaft tombs along with the number and quality of the grave goods indicate that the tombs were used exclusively by the society's [[elite]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (2000) p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrate that the shaft tomb cultures were highly stratified at this early date.

The sites of El Opeño and [[La Campana (archaeological site)|La Campana]] in [[Colima]] feature some shaft tombs, and are often associated with the [[Capacha]] culture.

==Ceramic figurines and tableaus==
[[File:Shaft tomb tree tableau 2.jpg|300px|thumb|A Nayarit tableau showing a multi-layered tree with birds.  It has been proposed that the birds represent souls who have not yet descended into the underworld,&lt;ref&gt;AMNH, [http://anthro.amnh.org/anthropology/research/mca_objects.cfm?case_number=3], which further cites Butterwick, Kristi (2004) ''Heritage of Power: Ancient Sculpture from West Mexico'', Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; while the central tree may represent the [[Mesoamerican world tree]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/cofa/a_ah/dir/precol/west_mexico.htm Kappelman]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Grave goods]] within these tombs include hollow ceramic figures, [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] and [[shell jewelry]], semi-precious stones, pottery (which often contained food), and other household implements such as spindle whorls and [[metate]]s (see [https://www.flickr.com/photos/petwerewolf/85154232/ this Flickr photo] for a reconstruction).  More unusual items include [[conch shell]] trumpets covered with stucco and other appliques.  Unlike those of other Mesoamerican cultures such as the [[Olmec]] and the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], shaft tomb artifacts carry little to no iconography and so are seemingly bereft of symbolic or religious meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias (1957) p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Shaft tomb culture marriage pair Met.jpg|250px|thumb|right|An ancestor pair from Nayarit, 100 BCE - 200 CE, executed in the Ixtlán del Río style.]]

The plentiful ceramic figurines have attracted the most attention, and are among the most dramatic and interesting produced in [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Christensen.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, these ceramics were apparently the primary outlet for artistic expression for the shaft tomb cultures and there is little to no record of associated monumental architecture, [[stela]]e, or other public art.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the vast majority of these ceramics are without [[provenance]], analysis has largely focused on the ceramics' styles and subjects.

===Styles===
The major stylistic groups include:

*[[Ixtlán del Rio (archaeological site)|Ixtlan del Rio]].  These abstract figurines have flat, squarish bodies with highly stylized faces complete with nose rings and multiple earrings.  Seated figurines have thin rope-like limbs while the standing figurines have short stocky limbs.  One of the first styles to be described, noted ethnographer, and caricaturist [[Miguel Covarrubias]] stated that it "reaches the limits of absurd, brutal caricature, a peculiar aesthetic concept that relishes the creation of haunting subhuman monstrosities".&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, p. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historian [[George Kubler]] finds that "the square bodies, grimacing mouths, and staring eyes convey a disturbing expression which is only in part resolved by the animation and plastic energy of the turgid forms".&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinesco style reclining female - Nayarit Mexico - 300 BCE-300 CE.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A Chinesco-style figurine (Type C), showing the archetypal puffy, slit-like eyes and short tapered legs.]]

*"Chinesca" or "Chinesco" figurines were named by art dealers after their supposed Chinese-like appearance. An early type, Chinesco is identified with Nayarit&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kubler, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and up to five major subgroups have been identified, although there is considerable overlap.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson state that the Chinesco types "merge in a rather complex fashion", p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  Type A figurines, the so-called "[[:Image:Chinesca Nayarit.jpg|classic Chinesco]]",&lt;ref&gt;Kan. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; are realistically rendered.  One prominent curator, Michael Kan, finds that "their calm, subtle exterior suggests rather than demonstrates emotion".&lt;ref&gt;Kan, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  These Type A figures are so similar to one another that it has been suggested that they were the production of a single "school".&lt;ref&gt;Kan, p. 17, who references Peter Furst (1966) "Shaft Tombs, Shell Trumpets and Shamanism", Ph. D. dissertation, UCLA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Types B through E are more abstract, characterized by puffy, slit-like eyes blended into the face, and broad rectangular or triangular heads.  These figures are often shown seated or reclining, with shortened bulbous legs quickly tapering to a point.&lt;ref&gt;Kan. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Ameca style, associated with Jalisco, is characterized by an elongated face and a high forehead which is often capped by braids or turban-like headgear. The [[aquiline nose]] is also elongated and the large eyes are wide and staring, with pronounced rims created by adding separate strips of clay ("fillets") around the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, p. 91.  These "fillets" are often referred to as appliqués.&lt;/ref&gt;  The wide mouth is closed or slightly opened and the large hands have carefully delineated nails.  Kubler detects both an early "sheep-faced" style that seem "eroded or melted in the continuous passages of modelling that unite rather than divide the parts of the body" and a later style which are "more animated and more incisively articulated".&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Colima shaft tomb dog (T Aleto).jpg|300px|thumb|A fat, and perhaps fattened, dog from Colima &lt;ref&gt;In discussing ceramic types, Kubler, p. 195, refers to the "fattened and edible dogs of Colima".&lt;/ref&gt;]]
*Colima ceramics can be identified by their smooth, round forms and their warm brown-red [[slip (ceramics)|slip]].&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art [http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/05/cam/ho_1979.206.478.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;  Colima is particularly known for its wide range of animal, especially dog, figurines.  Human subjects within the Colima style are more "mannered and less exuberant" than other shaft tomb figurines.&lt;ref&gt;Kan, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other styles include El Arenal, San Sebastián, and Zacatecas.  Although there is general agreement on style names and characteristics, it is not unanimous.  Moreover, these styles often overlap to one degree or another, and many figurines defy categorization.

===Subject matter===
Common subjects of shaft tomb tradition ceramics are:

*Ceramic tableaus showing several or even several dozen people engaged in various seemingly typical activities.  Concentrated in highland Nayarit and adjoining Jalisco, these tableaus present rich [[ethnography|ethnographic]] insight into [[funeral|funerary]] practices, the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], architecture (most importantly perishable architecture), and perhaps even religious thought during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|late Formative period]].&lt;ref&gt;See Taylor for discussion of the religious insight offered by these tableaus.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tableaus are almost photographic in their detail and have even been associated with architecture ruins in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Foster et al., p. 47 as well as Wiegand, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Shaft tomb culture village scene.jpg|300px|thumb|A characteristic circular ceramic tableau showing more than a dozen musicians and dancers]]
*Ceramic dogs are widely known from looted tombs in Colima.  Dogs were generally believed in [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures to represent soul guides of the dead&lt;ref&gt;Among many others, see Coe et al., pp. 103–104, or Kubler, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; and several dog ceramics wear human masks.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=colima%20dog%20mask&amp;w=all these photos] from Flickr for an example of a mask-wearing Colima dog.  Another is part of the Stafford Collection at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (see ''Sculpture of Ancient West Mexico, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima'').&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, it should also be noted that dogs were often the major source of animal protein in ancient Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1994), p. 45 and many others.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ancestor (or marriage) pairs of female and male figurines are common among shaft tomb tradition grave goods.  These figurines, perhaps representing ancestors,&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art, [http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Heritage_of_Power/Heritage_of_Power_more.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;  may be joined or separate and often are executed in the [[Ixtlán del Río]] style.
*Many shaft tomb figurines, spanning various Western Mexico styles and locations, wear a horn set high on the forehead.  Several theories have been advanced for these horns: that they show that the figure is a [[shaman]], that they are abstract [[conch|conch shells]] (a not uncommon shaft tomb relic)&lt;ref&gt;The Las Cebollas tomb contained 125 conch shells (Meighan &amp; Nicholson, p. 39).  Beekman (2000) lists conch shell trumpets, along with dogs and horned figures, as three examples of "common symbolic threads" of the shaft tomb tradition.&lt;/ref&gt; and as such, are an emblem of rulership, or are a [[phallic symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;Danien.&lt;/ref&gt;  These theories are not mutually exclusive.

===Uses===
While these ceramics were obviously recovered as [[grave goods]], there is a question of whether they were specifically created for a mortuary rite, or whether they were used prior to burial, perhaps by the deceased.  While some ceramics do show signs of wear, it is as yet unclear whether this was the exception or the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==

===Western Mexico cultures===
Considerable effort has been made connecting the shaft tomb tradition to the [[Teuchitlán tradition]], a complex society that occupies much the same geography as the shaft tomb tradition.

Unlike the typical [[Mesoamerican pyramids]] and rectangular central plazas, the Teuchitlán tradition is marked by central circular plazas and unique conical pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;Weigand, p. 402.  Weigand contends that the structures of the Teuchitlán tradition's ceremonial architecture "are unique in the Mesoamerican architectural repertoire and indeed are not found anywhere else in the world".&lt;/ref&gt;  This circular architectural style is seemingly mirrored in the many circular shaft tomb tableau scenes.  Known primarily from this architecture, the Teuchitlán tradition rises at roughly the same time as the shaft tomb tradition, 300 BCE, but lasts until 900 CE, many centuries after the end of the shaft tomb tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (2000) abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Teuchitlán tradition appears to be an outgrowth and elaboration of the shaft tomb tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (1996), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesoamerican cultures===
Because western Mexico is on the very periphery of [[Mesoamerica]], it has long been considered outside the Mesoamerican mainstream and the cultures at this time appear to be particularly insulated from many mainstream Mesoamerican influences.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, no [[Olmec]]-influenced artifacts have been recovered from shaft tombs, nor are any [[Mesoamerican calendars]] or [[Mesoamerican writing systems|writing systems]] in evidence,&lt;ref&gt;Michelet, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; although some Mesoamerican cultural markers, particularly the Mesoamerican ballgame, are present.

[[File:Ameca style figurine from Jalisco (Zeetz Jones).jpg|right|230px|thumb|An Ameca-style figurine from Jalisco. The horn is a not-uncommon feature of many tradition figurines.  The ball would appear to link the subject to the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].]]

Despite this, the inhabitants of this area lived much like their Mesoamerican counterparts elsewhere.  The usual trio of beans, squash, and [[maize]] was supplemented with chiles, [[manioc]] and other tubers, various grains, and with animal protein from domestic dogs, turkeys, and ducks, and from hunting.  They lived in thatched roof [[wattle-and-daub]] houses, grew cotton and tobacco, and conducted some long-distance trade in obsidian and other goods.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaft tombs themselves are not encountered elsewhere in Mesoamerica and their nearest counterparts come from northwestern South America.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 50. Meighan and Nicholson state that one other example of a shaft tomb complex, dating from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Postclassic]], 1000 years later, is found in [[Mixteca Alta]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===South American shaft tombs===
Shaft tombs also appear in northwestern South America in a somewhat later timeframe than western Mexico (e.g. 200-300 CE in northern Peru, later in other areas).  To Dorothy Hosler, Professor of Archaeology and Ancient Technology at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], "The physical similarities between the northern South American and West Mexican tomb types are unmistakable."&lt;ref&gt;Hosler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cB-PLQpbk-4C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=shaft+tomb+mexico&amp;sig=_5fJCLp_oYNekzKLGzlRPGcezWw#PPA16,M1 p. 16].&lt;/ref&gt; while art historian George Kubler finds that the western Mexican chambers "resemble the shafted tombs of the upper Cauca river in Colombia".&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others  disagree that the similarity of form demonstrates cultural linkages—Karen Olsen Bruhns states that "this sort of contact . . . seems mainly in the (muddled) eye of the synthesizer".&lt;ref&gt;Bruhns, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other linkages between Western Mexico and northwestern South America have been proposed, in particular the development of metallurgy.&lt;ref&gt;Hosler's essay focuses on this linkage.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica]].

[[File:Western Mexico Shaft tomb house 3.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A ceramic house showing the distinctive roof associated not only with the shaft tomb cultures but the subsequent [[Teuchitlan tradition]] as well.  It has been proposed that these models show the house of the living above and attached to the house of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==History of scholarly research==
The first major work to discuss artifacts associated with the shaft tomb tradition was [[Carl Sofus Lumholtz|Carl Lumholtz]]'s 1902 work, ''Unknown Mexico''.  Along with illustrations of several of the grave goods, the Norwegian explorer described a looted shaft tomb he had visited in 1896.  He also visited and described the ruins of [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]], the seat of [[Purépecha Empire]] some 150 miles (250&amp;nbsp;km) to the east, and was one of the first to incorrectly use the term "Tarascan" (Purépecha) to describe the shaft tomb artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 33.  Crossley.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, artist [[Diego Rivera]] began accumulating many Western Mexico artifacts for his private collection, a personal interest that sparked a wider public interest in West Mexican grave goods.&lt;ref&gt;Sund, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was in the late 1930s that one of the most prominent of Western Mexico archaeologists, [[Isabel Truesdell Kelly]], began her investigations.  In the period from 1944 until 1985, Kelly would eventually publish over a dozen scholarly papers on her work in this region.  In 1948, she was the first to hypothesize the existence of the "shaft tomb arc", the geographic distribution of shaft tomb sites over western Mexico (see map above).&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Salvador Toscano challenged the attribution of shaft tomb artifacts to the Purépechans,&lt;ref&gt;See Sund, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_4_82/ai_69411773/pg_32 p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt; a challenge that was echoed in 1957 by [[Miguel Covarrubias]] who firmly declared that [[Purépecha culture]] appeared only "after the 10th century".&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, pp. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Toscano's and Covarrubias's views were later upheld by radiocarbon dating of plundered shaft tombs' charcoal and other organic remains salvaged in the 1960s by Diego Delgado and Peter Furst.  As the result of these excavations and his ethnological investigations of the modern-day indigenous [[Huichol people|Huichol]] and [[Cora people]]s of Nayarit, Furst proposed that the artifacts were not only mere representations of ancient peoples, but also contained deeper significance.  The model houses, for example, showed the living dwelling in context with the dead – a miniature [[cosmogram]] – and the horned warriors (as discussed above) were shaman battling mystical forces.&lt;ref&gt;See Coe, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Hasso von Winning published an exhaustive classification of Western Mexico shaft tomb artifacts (including, for example, the Chinesco A through D types mentioned above), a classification still largely in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Among others, see Meighan and Nicholson, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1993 discovery of an unlooted shaft tomb at Huitzilapa is the latest major milestone, providing "the most detailed information to date on the funerary customs" associated with shaft tomb tradition.&lt;ref&gt;López Mestas C. and Jorge Ramos de la Vega, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''X-Rated Ambition: The Traci Lords Story''''' is a 2003 British [[documentary film]] directed by Simon Kerslake. It follows American actress [[Traci Lords]]' career in the [[Pornography|adult film industry]] when she, at the age of only 15, became one of the biggest pornstars. The documentary features interviews with many of her co-workers from that time including porn agent [[Jim South]], photographer [[Suze Randall]] and pornstars [[Tom Byron]], [[Ginger Lynn]], [[Peter North (actor)|Peter North]], [[Ron Jeremy]], [[Amber Lynn]] and [[Nina Hartley]].

==Plot==
In 1984, a young girl named Kristie Elizabeth Nussman walked into the office of the porn agent Jim South searching for a job. She became known as Traci Lords, one of the most sought-after pornstars of the 1980s. However, nobody knew that Nussman was actually Nora Kuzma, a fifteen-year-old runaway who by the time she was eighteen had already appeared in dozens of X-rated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldofwonder.net/productions/x-rated-ambition-traci-lords/|title=Traci Lords: X-Rated Ambition|date=12 April 2004|website=[[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]]|access-date=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Zaide''''' (originally, ''Das Serail'') is an unfinished [[Opera in German|German-language opera]], [[Köchel catalogue|K.]]&amp;nbsp;344, written by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] in 1780. [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]], in 1778, was in the process of setting up an opera company for the purpose of performing [[Opera in German|German opera]]. One condition required of the composer to join this company was that he should write a comic opera. At [[Salzburg]] in 1779 Mozart began work on a new opera (now known as ''Zaide'' although Mozart did not give it such a title). It contains spoken dialogue, which also classifies it as a ''[[Singspiel]]'' (literally, "singing play"). Only the arias and ensembles from the first two acts were composed. Missing are an overture and third act.

It was popular at the time for operas to depict the rescue of enslaved Westerners from Muslim courts, since Muslim pirates were preying on Mediterranean shipping, particularly to obtain slaves for various purposes. This story portrays Zaide's effort to save her beloved, Gomatz.

Mozart was composing for a German [[libretto]] by [[Johann Andreas Schachtner]], set in [[Turkey]], which was the scene of his next, completed rescue Singspiel (''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]''). He  soon abandoned ''Zaide'', to work on ''[[Idomeneo]]'', and never returned to the project. The work was lost until after his death, when [[Constanze Mozart]], his wife, found it in his scattered manuscripts in 1799. The fragments would not be published until 1838, and its first performance was held in [[Frankfurt]] on January 27, 1866, the 110th anniversary of Mozart's birth. ''Zaide'' has since been said to be the foundations of a masterpiece, and received critical acclaim. The tender soprano air, "Ruhe sanft, mein holdes Leben" is the only number that might be called moderately familiar.

The title ''Zaide'' was supplied by the Mozart researcher [[Johann Anton André]], who first published the score, including his own completion of it, in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfsymphony.org/Watch-Listen-Learn/Read-Program-Notes/Program-Notes/MOZART-Three-Arias-from-Zaide,-K-344-336b.aspx San Francisco Symphony]. Retrieved 2 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  André's father [[Johann André]] had set the same text to music, before Mozart commenced his singspiel.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Howard. [http://utahopera.org/backstage/2014/04/the-singspiel-and-mozart/ "The Singspiel and Mozart"]. Retrieved 2 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern companion pieces to'' Zaide'' have been written by both [[Luciano Berio]] and [[Chaya Czernowin]].

In modern performances, Mozart's [[Symphony No. 32 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 32]], K.&amp;nbsp;318, which was composed around the same time as ''Zaide'' and later used as an overture to [[Francesco Bianchi (composer)|Francesco Bianchi]]'s ''[[La villanella rapita]]'' (1784), is often given as an overture to ''Zaide''. Completions of the opera may use a pastiche of Mozart's concert arias or, more popularly, music from ''[[Thamos, King of Egypt]]'', also from the same period of Mozart's career.

==Style==
''Zaide'' can neither be described as [[opera buffa]] or [[opera seria]]; it contained elements of both forms, and parallels may be drawn to both genre in Mozart's work. ''Zaide'' is also notable as being one of only two dramatic pieces by Mozart to contain [[melodrama]] (the other being ''[[Thamos, King of Egypt]]''). Most of the spoken dialogue to ''Zaide'' has been lost, though there have been various attempts in modern times to write new dialogue to substitute for Schachtner's lost words.

==Performance history==
In 1995, [[La Monnaie|le Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie]] in Brussels presented ''Zaide'' in a production helmed by modern choreographer [[Lucinda Childs]] in her directing debut. In honor of the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth, a production of ''Zaide'' directed by [[Peter Sellars]] debuted at the [[Vienna Festival|Wiener Festwochen]] in 2006; it was later presented at the [[Mostly Mozart Festival]] in New York and the [[Barbican Centre]] in London. Sellars took the remaining fragments of ''Zaide'' and added excerpts from the composer's incidental music to the play ''Thamos, King of Egypt'', which, like ''Zaide'', was written when Mozart was 23. Taking off from the opera's theme of slavery, he set it in a contemporary sweatshop and cast it with African-American and Asian singers. The production featured the [[Concerto Köln]] under the direction of [[Louis Langrée]], sets by [[George Tsypin]], lighting by [[James F. Ingalls]], and costumes by Gabriel Berry. A revival, with the [[Camerata Salzburg]] in the pit, was presented at the [[Aix-en-Provence Festival]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Dermoncourt, Bertrand (30 June 2008).

==Synopsis==
Zaide falls in love with Gomatz, a slave, which strikes up jealousy and rage in the [[Sultan]], who happens to also admire her. After capture she chooses a free life with Gomatz rather than a good life with the Sultan. Allazim encourages the sultan to consider Gomatz as a man, not as a slave. The final surviving quartet suggests Zaide and Gomatz are sentenced to punishment or execution. This is where Mozart's manuscript breaks off.

There are similarities with [[Voltaire]]'s play ''[[Zaïre (play)|Zaïre]]'' (''Zara'') in which Zaïre, a Christian slave who had been captured as a baby falls in love with Osman, the Sultan of [[Jerusalem]]. Osman wrongly believes Zaïre and another Christian slave Nerestan (Gomatz in Mozart's opera) are lovers and kills Zaïre in a jealous rage and then kills himself. The elderly Lusignan, a prisoner of the Sultan (paralleled in the character Allazim) recognizes Zara and Nerestan as his children as she escorts him to safety. From the surviving arias we can deduce a few differences between Voltaire's play and Mozart's opera. By Act II of the opera Zaide, Gomatz, and possibly Allazim actually escape, only to be captured once more. In the opera there is no evidence that Mozart intended to cast Zaide, Gomatz and Allazim as a reunited family. Indeed, the original ending of Voltaire's play may have been too serious for contemporary tastes and may have been a reason for Mozart's leaving the project incomplete.

'''''Lo Zuccone''''' ({{IPA-it|lo dzukˈkoːne}}; Italian: literally, ''pumpkin''; figuratively ''bald-head'') is the popular name given to a [[marble]] [[statue]] by [[Donatello]].
