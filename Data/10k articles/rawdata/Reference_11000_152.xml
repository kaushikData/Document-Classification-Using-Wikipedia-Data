'''''American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh''''' 760 F. Supp. 796 (N.D. Cal. 1991),&lt;ref&gt;American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh, 760 F. Supp. 796 (N.D. Cal. 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; formerly ''American Baptist Churches v Meese'',  is a settlement reached on January 31, 1991 that resulted from a class action lawsuit against the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS), the [[Executive Office for Immigration Review]] (EOIR), and the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. (DOS). The suit was filed in 1985 by a coalition of religious organizations, refugee legal assistance organizations, and numerous human rights organizations, including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] (CCR), and the [[National Lawyers Guild]].(NLG)  Although the case originally stated two different groups of plaintiffs, various religious organizations involved in the Sanctuary movement and Central American refugees, after changes were made to criminal laws formerly used to prosecute these religious organizations, the focus of the suit was centered more specifically to claims of discrimination against Central American refugees in asylum seeking processes. This, they argued, was in direct violation of the tenets of the [[Refugee Act|Refugee Act of 1980]], which sought to create uniform criteria by which to review cases in which individuals fleeing political persecution and humanitarian crises would become eligible for asylum.  After five years, the settlement secured temporary protected status (TPS) for many Salvadoran and Guatemalan immigrants, providing them with among other things, [[Trial de novo|de novo]] asylum interviews, stays from deportation and work authorization.

== Initial Plaintiffs ==

=== Central American migrants  ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sanctuary-March-24-Article.jpg|thumb|A news article published on March 24, 1982 by the [[National Catholic Reporter]] covering the simultaneous announcements by religious organizations in Tucson and Berkeley (depicted) that they would provide Salvadoran migrants with sanctuary. March 24, 1982 was chosen to make the announcement as it was the second anniversary of the assassination of Archbishop [[Óscar Romero|Oscar Romero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event would mark the beginning of the Sanctuary movement in the United States. ]] --&gt;
In 1985, when the suit was originally filed,  there was and had been for some time, considerable violence in Central America.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, Charles D. Land, power, and poverty: agrarian transformation and political conflict in Central America. Unwin Hyman, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; For both Guatemala and El Salvador, this meant two civil wars that together, reached an estimated 275,000 deaths; 200,000 in Guatemala,&lt;ref&gt;Historical Clarification Commission. "Guatemala: Memory of silence." Guatemala City: Historical Clarification Commission (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and 75,000 in El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;From Madness to Hope: The 12-year war in El Salvador, Report of the U.N. Truth Commission on El Salvador, 1 April 1993
http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/salvador/informes/truth.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although this spanned thirty six years for Guatemala, with the beginning of the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] in 1960, the period of the greatest violence for Guatemala began in the 1980s, under the leadership of figures like [[Efraín Ríos Montt|Efrain Rios Montt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period was also one of intense violence in El Salvador, with the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] officially beginning in 1980 and ending in 1992. Both countries, experiencing stark poverty and political repression, similarly experienced the use of militarily trained “death squads”, forced disappearances, the formation of guerrilla resistance movements, and massacres such as [[El Mozote massacre|El Mozote]] in El Salvador and the [[Ixil people|genocide of indigenous Mayans]] in Guatemala. Under these conditions, there was a spike in migration from Central America to the United States, notably from El Salvador and Guatemala, which had not previously experienced large-scale migration to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious organizations involved in the Sanctuary Movement ===
It was in this context, coupled with the absence of protections afforded to refugees by asylum, that religious organizations began not only to provide services for migrants already living in the United States, but also, helping to transport refugees still in Central America to the United States through Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Villarruel, Kathleen L. "Underground Railroad and the Sanctuary Movement: A Comparison of History, Litigation, and Values, The." S. Cal. L. Rev. 60 (1986): 1429.&lt;/ref&gt; Defending these actions by contending that the individuals they had assisted were indeed, refugees, albeit unlawfully denied those protections, some in the movement were nonetheless prosecuted for their actions by the INS. This would lead to the beginning of the settlement, with various religious, legal, and community activist, organizations filing against the INS for the violation of rights of the religious organizations and the migrants themselves.

== Important Context and Evidence Against INS ==

=== Disproportionate Approval Rates and Discrimination ===
Despite the violence in Central America, there were not many approved cases for asylum in the United States for either Guatemalan or Salvadoran migrants. The INS Fiscal Year statistics for 1984 report for example, a 3 percent approval rate for Salvadoran migrants and a one percent of less approval rate for Guatemalan migrants the same year.&lt;ref&gt;BANNAN, ROSEMARY S.. 1986. “THE WORLD AS SANCTUARY”. Review of This Holy Ground: Church Sanctuary and Central American Refugees. Crosscurrents 36 (1). Wiley: 110–12. https://www.jstor.org/stable/24458920.&lt;/ref&gt; This was in stark contrast to a much higher rates of around thirty percent or higher. This would become a particularly important issue in the suit, addressing among other issues, what they believed was a systemic discrimination against Central American applicants.

=== Refugee Act of 1980 ===
Directly related to the issue of discrimination was the recent passage of the [[Refugee Act|Refugee Act of 1980]], an amendment to the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]] and the [[Migration and Refugee Assistance Act]] that was introduced to the Senate by Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] and signed by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. Among other goals, the stated purpose of the amendment was to address the needs of people who had faced persecution in their origin countries, and to provide them with assistance and opportunities to facilitate resettlement when needed and possible. In doing so, there was a great focus on humanitarian efforts to absorb refugees already present in the United States, whereas much of the focus before hand had been with concentrating refugee policy outside of the United States. Building on this precedent, and in some ways, testing its strength, the settlement would use the arguments made in the Refugee Act to argue that the INS had violated the goals of providing vulnerable communities that fit the definition of refugee with the protections of asylum.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Blum, Carolyn Patty. "Settlement of American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh: Landmark Victory for Central American Asylum-Seekers, The." Int'l J. Refugee L. 3 (1991): 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Orantes-Hernandez v Smith'' ===
Within the issue of low rates of granted asylum was also recent history of abuses against Salvadoran migrants by INS, as addressed in the case of ''Orantes-Hernandez v Smith''. Among these abuses was the detention of Salvadoran migrants without informing them of their [[Right of asylum|rights to apply for asylum]], as well as pressuring them to sign papers for their [[Voluntary departure (United States)|voluntary departure]], many times when the migrants did not understand what they were signing. Other instances also involved excessive force, providing false information, and threatening detainees who refused to sign with punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Orantes-Hernandez v. Smith, 541 F. Supp. 351 (C.D. Cal. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; This became important evidence to the arguments of discrimination, strengthening the case of the plaintiffs against the existing failures of INS.

== Settlement ==
After five years, a settlement was finally reached between the plaintiffs and for the most part, INS. Reasons for this were likely that litigation over the five years had been very expensive and that continuing on to a trial would have been even more expensive. The plaintiffs had also collected a substantial amount of evidence, and had what seemed to a very strong case against INS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ultimately, the plaintiffs were able to secure ''de novo'' adjudication for many Guatemalan and Salvadoran migrants, who while they waited for new interviews, were also granted a stay from deportation and work authorization. Those who did not meet the period of arrival or had committed an aggravated felony however, were barred from receiving asylum and settlement benefits.

=== Eligible for settlement benefits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh (ABC) Settlement Agreement

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Guatemalan Migrants
* Had to have entered into the United States on  or before October 1, 1990.
* Had to register on or before December 1, 1991. 
* Had to apply on or before January 3, 1995.
Salvadoran Migrants
* Had to have entered into the United States on  or before September 19, 1990.
* Had to register on or before October 31, 1991.
* Had to apply on or before February 16, 1996.

=== Settlement Benefits ===

==== [[Trial de novo|De novo]] asylum interviews ====
Previous decisions made about migrants who were eligible for the agreement benefits were disregarded, and if a denial for asylum was recommended to the [[Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs]] (BHRHA), INS would have to put forth specific reasons as to why.

==== Stays from deportation ====
Most applicants would be protected from deportation with exception of individuals who had committed a crime of [[moral turpitude]], which carried a sentence of at least 6 months, posed a national security risk, or was deemed a threat to public safety.

==== Work authorization ====
All applicants who met the requirements, as far as eligibility to receive settlement benefits, were eligible for work authorization as one of those benefits.

[[Image:Warpedtourpass.jpg|thumb|203px|Warped Tour 2006 All Access Pass]]
A '''backstage pass''' is an employee pass which allows its bearer access to employees-only areas at a performance venue. They are most commonly associated with [[rock music]] groups.

Such passes are usually a laminated paper worn on a lanyard, or on chain link or key chain holder at the belt, or a simpler "stick-on" applied to one's clothing. Plastic or paper wristbands may also be used.  However, some elaborately designed backstage passes have been used by [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] Productions/Winterland, Beaver Productions and many other regional and local promoters.  To deter counterfeiting, passes often include holograms or color-shifting properties.

At any one concert or event there are about 200 to 400 backstage passes available. Again, mainly these are for the performers, stage crews, roadies, security guards,
performer's agents. Sometimes relatives or close friends of performers, stage crew, promoters, etc. 
will get backstage passes to concerts. 

Some venues (including the [[House of Blues]] venues and Irving Plaza in New York) require their own passes to be worn, even by laminate holders for the tour.  Large music festivals, such as [[Ozzfest]] and the [[Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival]] also usually issue their own passes.

Backstage passes sometimes become [[memorabilia]] sold to die-hard fans, especially when the pass is signed by a performer.

In media, the term "Backstage Pass" may be used to signify the presence of expanded coverage of certain musical groups.

==Types of passes==
There are a number of different types of backstage passes:

*All Access passes allow the bearer unlimited access to the performance venue. Such passes are generally restricted to the performers, their crew and management, and management of the venue.
*Stage Crew passes are used by those who set up the stage. If used by local, temporary help, such passes are usually valid only during this part of day, and not for during or after the show.
*Other employee passes for people who work specific jobs in support of the act, such as catering, security, and merchandising personnel.
*Passes for media, such as press reporters and photographers.
*Limited Access passes are usually intended for specially selected fans that get to "meet and greet" the performers, and can also be used for guests of the band in order to give them VIP status. Sometimes these passes will actually have VIP printed on them. These passes are often issued for afterparties.
*Backstage passes are also given out by the band and band's manager to selected fans who want to hang out with the band. These passes are commonly associated with [[groupies]], and are frequently issued for afterparties.

Otto Printing (in Kentucky) and PERRi Entertainment (in Reno, NV) helped establish the industry and were two of the largest manufactures and designers of passes up until 2003. When PERRi folded, the current leading printer of backstage passes emerged: [http://www.accesseventsolutions.com ACCESS Event Solutions.] Reno has become the largest source for backstage pass printing. Otto is still printing passes and is the oldest printer of backstage passes.  While currently Reno and Otto Printing produce the largest amount of back stage passes, there are many companies looking to surpass them in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idcreator.com/back-stage-passes|date=June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some ways to get backstage passes. One way is to get employed for the venue. 
Some backstage passes are given as prizes by official fan clubs. Sometimes local radio stations and/or local music shops will obtain one or a few from the concert promoters or their agents and will give away as a type of promotional prize.

[[image:British Poultry Standard.png|thumb|right|The front cover of the 6th Edition of the British Poultry Standards.]]

The '''''British Poultry Standard''''' is the oldest [[animal fancy|poultry fancy]] [[breed standard]] in the world. It is published by the [[Poultry Club of Great Britain]] and is the official reference standard used by judges at poultry shows within the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.

==History==

The standard was first published in 1865 by the original Poultry Club of Great Britain,&lt;ref name=1sted/&gt; a club which existed for only three years.&lt;ref name=pcgb/&gt; It was entitled ''The standard of excellence in Exhibition Poultry'' and was edited by [[William Bernhardt Tegetmeier]].&lt;ref name=1sted/&gt; It was the first publication of its kind. The compilation of the standard was then taken over by the second, current [[Poultry Club of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=pcgb/&gt; The number of editions of the standard that have been published is uncertain, as each successive publisher that has been used by the Poultry Club of Great Britain has started again with a first edition.&lt;ref name=pcgb/&gt; The current edition, published in 2008 by [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]], is the sixth in the current numbering.&lt;ref name=roberts/&gt;

==Use==
{{main|List of breeds in the British Poultry Standards}}
The standard is the official reference for use by judges at poultry shows in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. It contains breed standards of more than 150 breeds of [[chicken]]s, [[Domestic duck|ducks]], [[Domestic goose|geese]] and [[Domestic turkey|turkeys]]; [[domestic pigeon|pigeons]] are not included.

'''Christopher Hills''' (April 9, 1926 – January 31, 1997) was an English-born author, philosopher, and scientist, popularly described as the "Father of Spirulina"&lt;ref&gt;''San Jose Mercury News'' obituary, February 2, 1997:- "Spirulina Czar"&lt;/ref&gt; for popularizing [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] [[cyanobacteria]] as a food supplement. He also wrote 30 books on consciousness, [[meditation]], [[yoga]] and spiritual evolution, [[divining]], [[world government]], [[aquaculture]], and personal health.

Hills was variously headlined by the press as a "Western Guru Scientist",&lt;ref&gt;Western Guru Scientist – ''Holistic Health &amp; Medicine'' magazine, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; "Natural Foods Pioneer",&lt;ref&gt;Natural Foods Pioneer – ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Feb 10, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; "Evolutionary Revolutionary"&lt;ref&gt;"Evolutionary Revolutionary" – ''Monterey Peninsula Herald'', Jan 29, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and a "Modern Merlin".&lt;ref&gt;Modern Merlin, Hills Seeks Answers in the Mountains – ''Oakland Tribune'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

As a successful commodities trader and art patron in Jamaica, he retired from business at an early age to follow a spiritual quest that took him around the world as a speaker, author, entrepreneur and pioneer of algae as one of the most efficient sources of food and fuel for humanity.

==Early biography==
Born in Grimsby, England to a family of fishermen, Hills grew up sailing the bleak and turbulent [[North Sea]]. In 1940 he enrolled as a cadet in nautical school and joined the [[British Merchant Navy]] during [[World War II]]. At sea, Hills had several life and death experiences that formed his views on [[karma]], divinity and destiny. On one occasion a rogue wave swept him off the deck hundreds of yards (metres) away from the vessel, but another wave picked him up and threw him back onto the ship,&lt;ref&gt;''The Movie of Life'' – Early Morning Meditations series, volume MM3&lt;/ref&gt; cutting open his forehead but saving him from freezing to death. As German [[U-boat]]s sank 2,828 merchant ships, he watched tanker crew colleagues incinerated in the flaming oil-slicked Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Thirty thousand men of the British Merchant Navy were killed. ''Battle of Wits'', p. 280, {{ISBN|0-684-85932-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war, as navigating officer for an [[Esso]] oil tanker, Hills found himself docked in [[Curaçao]], where he set up shop as a [[commodities trader]] with branch offices in [[Venezuela]] and [[Aruba]].

Encountering problems with South American contract law when a client reneged on a deal, Hills moved to [[Jamaica]], where business was conducted under the [[British judicial system]]. There with the help of plantocrat philanthropist Percy Junor&lt;ref&gt;"Indisputably one of Jamaica's most successful self-made men" - ''Sunday Gleaner'', March 8, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; he founded commodity companies specializing in sugar, bananas, insurance, telegraph communications and agricultural spices pimento, [[nutmeg]]s and [[ginger]]. Financing for the first export corporation came from British businessman Andrew Hay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/18/nyregion/andrew-mackenzie-hay-73-trade-expert.html| work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Andrew Mackenzie Hay, 73, Trade Expert | date=18 May 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then husband of best-selling motivational author [[Louise Hay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/magazine/04Hay-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0| work=[[The New York Times]] | title=The Queen of the New Age | date=4 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who in the 1950s was a high-fashion model and Hills family friend.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2007/04/23/hlouise123.xml Louise Hay Interview] www.telegraph.co.uk, 23 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 Christopher Hills married a young English woman, Norah Bremner, deputy headmistress of [[Wolmer's School]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Her father, Bernard E. Bremner B.E.M.,&lt;ref&gt;"32 Years in Civil Defence" Mr. Bremner a leading figure in civil defence since 1930 awarded the  [[British Empire Medal]], ''Eastern Daily Press'', pg 5, Oct 11, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; was the Magistrate, Chief of Customs, and Mayor&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. and Mrs. B.E.

The family frequently sailed to England for events such as the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] and Mayor Bremner's presenting Her Majesty Queen [[Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] with Freedom of the Borough,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/queen-elizabeth-the-queen-mother-signing-a-declaration-of-news-photo/3366713| work=[[Getty Images]] | title=Kings Lynn Ceremony | date=26 July 1954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which encompassed the royal family's home at nearby [[Sandringham, Norfolk|Sandringham]].

==Jamaica business leader==
From 1949 to 1967, Christopher and Norah Hills became influential forces in Jamaica's commerce, art, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Music Awards, Christopher Hills Challenge Cup - ''The Daily Gleaner'', July 4, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jamaica Governor with Kapo and Christopher Hills.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.10|Governor of Jamaica Sir [[Hugh Foot]] opening a 1957 Hills Galleries exhibition showing works by Mallica "Kapo" Reynolds with Christopher Hills]]
Believing that Jamaica's strength lay in its agriculture, Christopher Hills co-founded the Jamaica Agriculture &amp; Industrial Party (AIP)&lt;ref&gt;"Statistics Support Call for Third Party" - ''Daily Gleaner'', September 13, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative to the two major political parties: [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP) and [[People's National Party]] (PNP), both of which he felt were too busy warring with each other to look out for the middle class and the country people who were the backbone of Jamaica's rural economy. Despite competing vigorously in the polls, the Hills couple were nevertheless close friends with JLP leader Sir [[Alexander Bustamante]] and [[Norman Manley]], head of the PNP, who both served as [[Jamaican Prime Minister]]s. Norman Manley in fact had been best man at the Hills' wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Given in Marriage by Mr. N. W. Manley K.C. - ''Daily Gleaner'', July 31, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 Christopher and Norah Hills founded Hills Galleries Ltd, which, in cooperation with the Prime Minister's wife [[Edna Manley]],&lt;ref&gt;"She changed Jamaica for the better" - ''Globe and Mail'', June. 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Edna Manley: The Mother of Modern Jamaican Art" - ''Woman's Art Journal'', Vol. 7, No. 2 (Autumn 1986 - Winter 1987) pp. 36-40&lt;/ref&gt; became a nexus of the [[Jamaican art]] movement. The Gallery &amp; Antiques showroom&lt;ref&gt;Hills Galleries - ''Daily Gleaner'' March 3, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; at 101 Harbour Street, Kingston was built on the site of [[Simon Bolivar]]'s Jamaica residence where, in 1815, the revolutionary wrote his famous letter [[Carta de Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://faculty.smu.edu/bakewell/BAKEWELL/texts/jamaica-letter.html| work=The Colonial Press Inc. | title=The Selected Writings of Simón Bolívar | date=1951 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Hills Galleries supplied and exhibited local celebrity artists [[Ian Fleming]] and [[Noël Coward]], enjoyed the patronage of British royals&lt;ref&gt;"Queen Mother and Lady Fermoy visit Jamaica" - ''Daily Gleaner'', February 22, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lady Morley opens Hills Galleries exhibition" - ''Daily Gleaner'', November 21, 1962, p 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Of Beauty and Majesty", Princess Margaret's visit - ''Daily Gleaner'', February 24, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; and such high-profile clients as [[Sadruddin Aga Khan]], [[Winthrop Rockefeller]],&lt;ref&gt;Knodler Gallery New York - "Jamaican Paintings Join Top Bracket" - ''Daily Gleaner'', July 15, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;"Hills Dine with Elizabeth Taylor, Eddie Fisher" - ''[[Sunday Gleaner]]'', March 31, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Elizabeth Taylor buys three Gaston Tabois paintings from Hills Galleries: "Village Street", "Rock River", "Rio Cobre Dam" - ''Daily Gleaner'', March 26, 1960, p 18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lady Bird Johnson]], [[Grace Kelly]] and [[Errol Flynn]].

Christopher Hills opened a Hills Galleries branch on Jamaica's north coast at [[Montego Bay]], mooring his yacht, the ''Robanne''&lt;ref&gt;"Artists sail to Round Hill exhibit aboard Christopher Hills' yacht the 40-ton Robanne" - ''Daily Gleaner'', April 17, 1956, p 12&lt;/ref&gt; at Round Hill, a popular resort for foreign leaders and industrialists vacationing in the Caribbean. It was there he met then Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and CBS president [[William S. Paley]], who in 1956, sponsored a Hills Galleries exhibition of Jamaican art at Barbizon Plaza&lt;ref&gt;New York Socialites Appreciate Jamaica's "Intuitive Art" - ''Sunday Gleaner'', March 3, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art &amp; Artists - ''New York Times'', March 2, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; in New York City, which awoke U.S. art collectors to Jamaica's dynamic sphere of artistic talent. The exhibition was described by the Daily Gleaner as "Epochal in the establishment of a market for West Indian art."&lt;ref&gt;A World of Glory to Record. Review by George Campbell - ''Daily Gleaner'', March 26, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; The Hills family spent weekends and holidays at [[Port Antonio]] visiting friends and clients including their neighbor, novelist [[Robin Moore]] at Blue Lagoon.&lt;ref&gt;"Robin Moore's Big Marlin Bet" Telepathy experiment, ''Supersenonics - The Science of Radiational Paraphysics'', 0-916438-18-X (1975) p 593&lt;/ref&gt; There Hills met [[Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza]] who asked Hills to curate part of his art collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/28/nyregion/baron-thyssen-bornemisza-industrialist-who-built-fabled-art-collection-dies-81.html | work=The New York Times | title=Industrialist Who Built Fabled Art Collection, Dies at 81 | date=28 April 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For five years many classic works of the baron's international art acquisitions decorated the walls of the Hills' home. Von Thyssen also granted Hills' children access to his private island at San San near Port Antonio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.jamentrust.org | work=Jamaica Environment Trust | title=Pellew Island | date=5 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Hills had just returned from sailing the ''Robanne'' to Havana when he met [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] who had given a speech honoring a visit to Jamaica by [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]]. At the gallery Stevenson fell in love with Hills' George III period Sheraton bow-fronted desk,&lt;ref&gt;"Jamaican Mementoes" - ''Daily Gleaner'', September 18, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; immediately purchasing it for his own office in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Adlai Stevenson paid $328.00 with [[Northern Trust]] Company personal check No.5162 ($2,884 in today's dollars)&lt;/ref&gt; Over dinner, Hills shared his observations of simmering revolution in Cuba, while he and Stevenson compared their concepts of justice, democracy, conflict and dictatorships — a conversation that inspired Hills to publish his ideas for uplifting the world's underprivileged masses in his landmark volume ''Rise of the Phoenix''.&lt;ref&gt;''Rise of the Phoenix - Universal Government by Nature's Laws'', 0-916438-04-X (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rastafari movement==

Hills also became an advocate for Jamaica's [[Rastafari movement]], who were being oppressed in the late fifties.&lt;ref&gt;"Rasta Spirit Knows no Boundaries" - ''Daily Gleaner'', June 22, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; He gave Rastafarians jobs as [[woodcarver]]s, free paints to poor artists, such as the now-famed Ras Dizzy and bailed them out of [[Spanish Town Prison]] while encouraging rasta brethren to sustain themselves through art and music. Christopher and Norah Hills were personally thanked for their years of support for struggling rastas by [[Mortimo Planno]], the Rasta teacher of [[Bob Marley]] and one of the few Rastafarian elders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/mortimer-planno-6102816.html | work=[[The Independent]] | title=Revered Rastafarian leader | date=25 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to have met with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]].

Hills also "reasoned" [[Mohandas Gandhi|Gandhian]] non-violence with [[Leonard Howell]], the original "Gong"&lt;ref&gt;Bob Marley named his record label [[Tuff Gong]] after Leonard "The Gong" Howell&lt;/ref&gt; activist who founded Pinnacle, a Rastafarian community farm at [[Sligoville]], a few miles from Hills' home. In 1958 Pinnacle was raided in a brutal crackdown by the authorities, ostensibly for growing [[marijuana]], but in fact Rastafarianism at that time was regarded by The Crown as a threat to social harmony. Hills interceded with the Prime Minister but, with an election coming, law &amp; order politics prevailed and many sustainable farming families had to leave the land. For his support, Hills was given the moniker "The First White Rasta". Unlike his skeptical friends and business colleagues, he saw Rastafarian spirituality as a righteous way of life, indeed growing out his hair and beard in solidarity and also in keeping with his emerging interest in the [[sadhu]]s and enlightened sages of India who had much in common with the vegetarian mystical Rastafarians.&lt;ref&gt;"Back to Africa" movement, Christopher Hills' speech at Addis Ababa - ''Kingston Gleaner'' July 22, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual awakening==
By 1960 Christopher Hills had accumulated a large [[Supernatural|metaphysical]] library on frequent trips to [[Samuel Weiser Books]] in New York, while writing his own books, ''Kingdom of Desire'', ''Power of the Doctrine'' and ''The Power of Increased Perception''. At 30 he retired from business&lt;ref&gt;"The Business of Art" - ''Business Sketch Magazine'', July 1961&lt;/ref&gt; and began to research multiple spiritual paths and the physics of what [[Einstein]] called [[Unified field theory]]. Prolific research papers and lectures came out of Hills' laboratory in the [[Blue Mountains (Jamaica)]] on subjects such as [[bioenergetics]], [[hypnosis]], tele-thought, [[biophysics]], effects of solar radiation on living organisms, resonant systems of [[ionosphere]], and capacitor effects of human body on static electricity and electron discharge of the nervous system. In 1960 he began a 30-year project to document the effects of sound and color on human consciousness and states of health.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuclear Evolution: Discovery of the Rainbow Body'' (2nd ed.), {{ISBN|0-916438-12-0}}, pp. 108, 190, 431&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global outreach ==

With Norah Hills running the galleries, Hills set forth on a two-year journey travelling in Asia, Europe, Pakistan and India, meeting with members of the [[United Nations|UN]] and calling on politicians, scientists and religious leaders. [[UNESCO]] hired him to shoot 1,000 photographs of their projects in faraway countries, which appeared in an exhibit at [[United Nations headquarters]].

Hills' global odyssey's itinerary grew out of publishing his views on [[conflict resolution]] and alternative government in a manifesto, ''Framework for Unity'', that was circulated to The Commission for Research in the Creative Faculties of Man, a network he had founded of thinkers around the world which, in 1961, included Prof. Oliver Reiser, [[Humphry Osmond]], Dr. [[Andrija Puharich]], [[David Ben-Gurion]], and Lady [[Isobel Cripps]], among its 500 members.

After teaming up with his good friend and noted lawyer [[Luis Kutner]] (co-founder of [[Amnesty International]]), Hills decided to search the world for a spot to establish a Center where a dedicated community could live and test his ''World Constitution for Self-Government by Nature's Laws'', which he published in a book with an introduction by [[Bertrand Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christ Yoga of Peace'' - Centre Publications, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

== Friendship with Nehru ==

Working his way on a speaking tour through Europe in the direction of India, Hills decided to make a precarious expedition to the remote Himalayan [[Hunza Valley]]&lt;ref&gt;"Hunza – Dreamland of the Hillside Farmer". ''Sunday Gleaner'', Feb. 3, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; where he had long been curious about the diet and extraordinary longevity of the [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]], [[Balti people|Balti]] and [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] hill tribes. In Pakistan, Hills was the guest of Professors Duranni and Walid Uddin at [[Peshawar's College of Engineering]]. Visiting Sufi holy men and Islamic scholars in [[Karachi]], he met [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] to discuss possible Indo-Pakistan cooperation in [[algae]] cultivation in the climatically suitable Gujrat-Sind border region, which is where Bhutto and his ancestors were from. Later, when Bhutto was overthrown in a military coup, Hills orchestrated urgent appeals to General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] for clemency, but, like many westerners protesting Bhutto's imprisonment, was ignored, and Bhutto was hanged.

In the 1950s Hills became known to Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]&lt;ref&gt;"The Nehru I Knew" – ''Sunday Gleaner'', full page, May 31, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; through his friend the Deputy leader of India's Congress Party, Surendra Mohan Ghose, a Bengali revolutionary and relative of [[Sri Aurobindo]]. Hills invited Ghose to Jamaica,&lt;ref&gt;S.M. Ghose, Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference – ''Daily Gleaner'', Nov 7, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; to speak at the 1961 [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference]], and together they formed a partnership to promote World Union and global famine relief through [[algae aquaculture]].&lt;ref&gt;''Food from Sunlight - Planetary Survival for Hungry People'', 0-916438-13-9 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; S.M. Ghose&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Leader to announce World Centre project" – ''Daily Gleaner'', November 4, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the founders of [[Auroville]], an experimental sustainable-living International Village in [[Tamil Nadu]]. In 1962 Ghose took Hills to [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] for a personal audience with Aurobindo's successor, spiritual head of the ashram, [[Mirra Alfassa]], known as "The Mother". Later Ghose arranged for Christopher Hills' son, John Hills, to give the keynote address at the World Parliament of Youth in [[Puducherry]] in 1971.
[[File:Christopher Hills Nehru Delhi.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.90| Christopher Hills with Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] at [[Teen Murti Bhavan]], New Delhi]]

In 1959 Hills had lobbied Nehru to approve a government in exile for the [[Dalai Lama]] fleeing persecution in [[Tibet]] and to grant full refugee status to exiled Tibetans. He had become connected to the Tibetans through his study of [[Buddhism]] and in 1960 provided funding for the [[Young Lama's Home School]]&lt;ref&gt;Cave in the Snow: A Western Woman's Quest for Enlightenment, [[Vicki Mackenzie]], 1999, {{ISBN|1-58234-045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dalhousie, Himachal Pradesh]] founded by his English friend [[Freda Bedi]], one of Gandhi's handpicked [[satyagrahi]]s&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rawlinson, "The Book of Enlightened Masters". Open Court, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8126-9310-8}}, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; who became Gelongma Karma Kechog Palmo,&lt;ref&gt;The Revolutionary Life of Freda Bedi, [[Vicki Mackenzie]], 2017, {{ISBN|9781611804256}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first Western woman to take ordination in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/saving-private-anushka/16096162#sthash.qqXeW0Rc.dpuf | work=Mid-Day Magazine | title=Remembering Freda | date=27 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freda Bedi is the mother of film and television star [[Kabir Bedi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001934/?ref_=nv_sr_1| work=IMDb | title=Internationally acclaimed Indian actor | date=1971–2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Hills contributed to Freda Bedi's building of the Karma Drubgyu Thargay Ling nunnery at [[Tilokpur]] in the [[Kangra Valley]] and helped organize her journey to the West with the [[16th Gyalwa Karmapa]], Rangjung Rigpe Dorje in 1974.

When Hills arrived in India, he found Nehru besieged by [[Sino-Indian border dispute|border disputes with China]] and discussion inevitably turned to Hills' theories of [[conflict resolution]] and how to avoid war.&lt;ref&gt;''Creative Conflict - The Secret of Heart-to-Heart Communication'', 0-916438-36-8 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Their connection also evolved out of the fact that India was experiencing famine in some states. With dependence on wheat shipments from the United States, Hills helped lobby President [[Lyndon Johnson]] for an increase in wheat aid, which was granted. But when Hills mentioned his research with algae as a food source, then Nehru became interested and offered to support cultivation in India. (PDF will be posted)

While in New Delhi, Hills spent time with the prime minister at [[Teen Murti Bhavan]], enjoying Jawaharlal Nehru's rose gardens and meeting his daughter [[Indira Gandhi]]. Hills was the guest of Indian industrialist [[G.D. Birla]], where on his first day in India, he had met [[Swami Shantananda]], an enlightened sage and a remarkably politically connected guru with whom Hills would travel throughout India for two years, much like a roaming [[sanyassin]]. On one of his "pilgrimages", Hills was taken by Shantanananda and Nehru's Parliamentary Secretary [[S.D. Upadhyaya]] to [[Brindavan]] for a private audience with India's highest female [[yogini]] [[Sri Anandamayi Ma]], from whom he felt a "genuine sublime holiness" and received one of the most significant blessings in his life.&lt;ref&gt;''The One I Love'', {{ISBN|0-916438-51-1}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Patna]], [[Bihar]], Hills, along with Dr [[Raynor Johnson]], were the only Europeans to attend the 1961 Science &amp; Spirituality Conference, where seeds were sown for Hills' decade of cooperation with hundreds of Indian scientists and yogis, many of whom eventually journeyed to visit Hills' centers in the West and who comprised many of the delegates for a 1970 Yoga conference Hills staged in New Delhi.

In 1963, the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] and [[Gandhi Peace Foundation]] sponsored another conference in Patna, hosted by Dr. [[Rajendra Prasad]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s longtime right-hand disciple and first [[President of India]]. Prasad was supposed to speak at the conference but became ill, and Hills' guru Shantananda was leading prayers for him every day at the Sadaqat Ashram in Patna. Prasad requested to meet Hills, whose goals for World Union he had heard about from Nehru. Hills considered Prasad the most spiritual of the founders of Independent India, and their meeting was a profound encounter in which Prasad gave his blessing for Hills' global endeavors, but then the president lost consciousness, tightly holding onto Hills' hand.&lt;ref&gt;''The President's Last Words – The One I Love'', {{ISBN|0-916438-51-1}}, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently Prasad never recovered, and at the time, there was a controversy that the man who, through [[satyagraha]], had resisted multiple British governments and Viceroys and been jailed by them for so many years, had said his last words to an Englishman.

== Microalgae International ==
In earlier travels from Jamaica to Japan, Hills had formed an [[aquaculture]] research company with his friend and colleague, biologist Dr Hiroshi Nakamura, Dean of [[Tokyo Women's University]]. Dr Nakamura was a noted scientist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=dr+hiroshi+nakamura&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gL-Se-olT7&amp;sig=eqhGViSlNxrXr4kafgW76OL0s3E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8RrUTsXIFOKoiALq74C5Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=dr%20hiroshi%20nakamura&amp;f=false | work=Yoga Journal | title=SPIRULINA - Food From The Sun's Light | page= 44 |date= May–June 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a colleague of Emperor [[Hirohito]] (himself a marine biologist) who asked Nakamura to research alternative food sources for Japan after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had devastated food supplies. The goal of Hills and Nakmura's organization Microalgae International Union, was to develop strains of algae as a way of harnessing the sun's energy for [[biofuel]]s and human nutrition and as a solution to World Hunger.&lt;ref&gt;''Spirulina - Food for a Hungry World'', 0-916438-47-3 - Micro Algae International Union, pp. 5, 69, 85&lt;/ref&gt; Presented with M.I.U.'s [[feasibility studies]], Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru endorsed Hills' proposal for bringing the cultivation of protein-rich [[Chlorella]] algae to the villages of India.&lt;ref&gt;''Food from Sunlight'', 0-916438-13-9, pp. 103–109&lt;/ref&gt;

With India's Home Minister, [[Gulzari Lal Nanda]], Hills had co-founded the Institute of Psychic and Spiritual Research in New Delhi. A devout Gandhian, Nanda feared social upheaval and possible communal violence if poor and hungry villagers started migrating to India's cities so he threw his support behind Hills' plan for developing rural economies via small footprint aquaculture that could help villages become sustainable. A detailed plan for a pilot project in the [[Rann of Kutch]] was approved by the Indian government. However, the initiative became mired in bureaucracy when Nehru died in 1964. Nanda became acting prime minister but only until the new Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] was nominated to succeed Nehru. Shastri continued working with Hills and had his staff prepare a budget request for Parliament to fund the [[chlorella]] algae project. However, because it competed with traditional agricultural interests, the aquaculture project became victim to political jockeying as well as an outbreak of war with Pakistan. With Shastri's mysterious death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/43-years-on-mystery-shrouds-postmortem-of-shastri/497076/ | work=Indian Express | title=Mystery of Prime Minister Shastri's Death | date=2 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Tashkent Declaration|1966 India-Pakistan peace conference]] in [[Tashkent]], the project lost its key sponsor.

Nevertheless, the networks Hills had established with the founders of modern India proved valuable when his son, John Hills, was introduced by Nanda and S.M. Ghose to Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], who helped the younger Hills&lt;ref&gt;"Young British Yogi Plans World Meet", ''Hindustan Times'', Sept 17, 1970, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; garner support among India's Congress party and religious leaders for India's largest conference of Western scientists and Indian yogis.&lt;ref&gt;"World Conference on Scientific Yoga" – ''Times of India'', Nov. 30, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

== Centre House, London ==

[[File:BKS Iyengar Centre House.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.70|Members of Centre House community with Hatha Yoga teacher Malcolm Strutt and Yoga Master [[B.K.S. Iyengar]]]]
Three years after [[History of Jamaica#Independent Jamaica|Jamaica's 1962 declaration of Independence]] from Britain, the Hills family moved to London, at the suggestion of two of his mentors, Bertrand Russell and [[Sir George Trevelyan, 4th Baronet]]. They helped Hills find and purchase a six-story Edwardian building in London's leafy [[Kensington]]. There Christopher Hills and others, including Kevin Kingsland, founded Centre House, a self-discovery and human-potential community&lt;ref&gt;"The Superman Project", ''News of the World'', Dec 5, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; known as a nucleus of yoga and spirituality in the emerging [[New Age]] movement throughout the late sixties and seventies. Seekers came from all over the world to study with visiting gurus, such as [[Swami Satchidananda]], [[Muktananda]], [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], [[Sangharakshita]] and [[John G. Bennett]] as well as Sanskrit scholar Dr. Rammurti Mishra,&lt;ref&gt;Rammurti S. Mishra - ''Yoga Sutras: The Textbook of Yoga Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christmas Humphreys]], Tibetan [[lama]]s, chief [[Druids]], [[homeopathic]]  doctors and scientists studying meditation, telepathy and [[neuroplasticity]] in Hills' Yoga Science laboratory. It was here Christopher Hills wrote his magnum opus, ''Nuclear Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;''Nuclear Evolution: Discovery of the Rainbow Body'' (2nd ed.), {{ISBN|0-916438-12-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; - recognized as a definitive treatise on the [[chakra]]s as they relate to the human [[endocrine system]], light frequencies and human personality. [[Yoga Journal]] described the book as, "Synthesizing a vast amount of information ranging from the structure of [[DNA]] to the [[metaphysics]] of consciousness" and also as, "A giant step forward in integrating science with religion in a meaningful way."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yoga Journal]] '' magazine - The Rainbow Body, March 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Centre House was an experiment in group consciousness where the majority of residents were well-educated students, teachers and scientists interested in the convergence of [[science and spirituality]]. For a while the large basement kitchen was a [[macrobiotic]] restaurant, first run by [[Craig Sams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Days In The Life: Voices from the English Underground 1961-1971 | first = Jonathon | last = Green | author-link = Jonathon Green | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=am6TOJ9tNscC&amp;lpg=PT190&amp;vq=february%2014&amp;dq=days%20in%20the%20life&amp;pg=PT190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | date = 1988 | publisher = Heinemann | isbn = 978-1-448-10444-4 | quote = "I remember Christopher Hills, who ran the Centre House, calling down one day, 'Can you please not smoke marijuana - we can smell it on the third floor.'

Kevin Kingsland went on to found the [[Centre for Human Communication]] in Devon and Grael Associates (a [[The Community Company|Community Company]])..

== World Conference on Scientific Yoga, New Delhi ==

In December 1970 Christopher Hills, his son John, and Kevin Kingsland organized the world's first World Conference on Scientific Yoga (WCSY)&lt;ref&gt;"World Yoga Conference" – ''Times of India'', Nov. 30, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; in New Delhi, bringing 50 Western scientists together with 800 of India's leading swamis, yogis and lamas to discuss their research and establish a network for the creation of a World Yoga University.
[[File:John Hills with Dhirendra Bramachari and Amrit Desai.jpg|right|thumb|250px|John Hills discusses the World Conference on Scientific Yoga program with [[Dhirendra Brahmachari]] and [[Amrit Desai]] in New Delhi]]

The conference generated some controversy&lt;ref&gt;"Masters of Emotions – Yogis Wind Up Parley By Losing Tempers", ''Los Angeles Times'', Dec 24, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; when Indian politics intersected with religion,&lt;ref&gt;"Yogis Act Unyogalike", ''The Daily Herald'', Dec 24, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the concept of ''Christ Yoga'', a book Hills had written linking Christ's teachings to those of [[Buddha]] and the [[Vedas]]. But the conclave nevertheless emerged as a milestone in the soon-to-be-booming migration of Indian yogis to the West. John Hills,&lt;ref&gt;"Young British Yogi Plans World Meet", ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', Sept 17, 1970, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; helped by his father's prior relationship with Nehru, worked with India's Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] and the Nehrus' yoga master [[Dhirendra Brahmachari]] to steer a fractious committee of MPs, ministers and often competitive spiritual leaders from disparate religions and castes into creating a uniquely diverse and widely hailed program of events.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, Dec 27, 1970 – "World Conference on Scientific Yoga"&lt;/ref&gt; Presenters from the West included [[transpersonal psychology]] pioneer Dr. [[Stanislav Grof]] and Dr. [[Sidney Jourard]] who compared their research in lively sessions with Indian scholars, scientists, philosophers and yogis such as [[B.K.S.

The actor [[James Coburn]], a yoga and martial arts practitioner, described the World Conference on Scientific Yoga as "Very rewarding for me, definitely worth the time and money getting here."&lt;ref&gt;"Yogi Film Moghul" – ''[[Times of India]]'', Dec 23, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the conference, Dhirendra Brahmachari presided over the wedding of organizer Kevin Kingsland and yoga teacher Venika Mehra. James Coburn also attended. Kevin and Venika Kingsland went on to establish various Centres for Human Communication in the UK, USA and India, teaching yoga, human communication and promoting community consciousness.

Post-conference, the select delegates' presentations were published in ''CHAKRA'' magazine, founded with the help of [[Tantra]] scholar Ajit Mookerjee and Indian art patron Virendra Kumar and edited by John Hills whose first venture in publishing was mentored by [[Baburao Patel]] M.P., editor of ''[[Filmindia]]'' and ''[[Mother India (magazine)|Mother India]]'' magazines.&lt;ref&gt;"Editor's Welcome" - ''CHAKRA Magazine'', Vol 1, March–May, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was deemed a success and Christopher Hills was elected by a majority of the delegates to establish a World Yoga University somewhere on the planet. A mission that would take him from the United Kingdom to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Yoga University Seeks Site" - ''San Mateo Times'', March 4, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

== University of the Trees ==

As the spiritual axis shifted to America, Christopher Hills visited his friend [[Laura Huxley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/dec/17/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries | work=[[The Guardian]], | title=Laura Huxley Obituary | date=17 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who urged him to move to the United States where he settled in [[Boulder Creek, California]], and became a U.S. citizen. There, amidst the ancient [[redwoods]], he founded in 1973,&lt;ref name="LA Times Obit"/&gt; an accredited college, University of the Trees, an alternative education and research center for the social sciences to study the laws of nature and their relation to [[human consciousness]].&lt;ref name="LA Times Obit"/&gt; Students lived on campus and studied subjects as diverse as [[Radionics]] and [[dowsing]] (Hills was a well-known diviner&lt;ref&gt;"Incredible Feat" – ''[[National Enquirer]]'', June 22, 1976, p. 14 (Diviner finds stolen loot for Santa Cruz Police)&lt;/ref&gt;), meditation, [[hatha yoga]], [[the Vedas]], and early forms of social networking he called "Group Consciousness".

The campus housed University of the Trees Press which published Christopher Hills' writings and the research of a number of resident students who obtained degrees at the university and wrote books on light &amp; color frequencies and the science of [[Radionics]]. A small workshop produced [[pendulums for dowsing]] and a line of [[negative ion generators]]. With the buildup of the vitamin business surrounding discoveries that spirulina had significant weight loss benefits University of the Trees became one of the largest employers in the [[San Lorenzo Valley]]&lt;ref&gt;"From Counterculture to Mainstream" – ''Santa Cruz Sentinel'' (Cover), Aug 19, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; and leased more than 10 buildings in Boulder Creek for housing students and warehousing for Light Force,&lt;ref&gt;"Spirulina – Miracle Pill or Mind Pill? " – ''[[The Press Democrat]]'', September 24, 1981, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; a burgeoning nutritional products brand based on spirulina.

From this base in California, Hills extended his hospitality to a pantheon of visiting scientists, writers, philosophers and scholars such as [[Alan Watts]], [[Edgar Mitchell]], [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Thelma Moss]], [[Hiroshi Motoyama]], [[Haridas Chaudhuri]], Sri Lanka president Ranasinghe Premadasa, [[Menninger Foundation]]'s [[Swami Rama]], Dr. [[Evarts G. Loomis]], [[Viktoras Kulvinskas]], [[Max Lüscher]], [[Marcia Moore]], Bernard Jensen and countless others in the fields of human potential, holistic health, aquaculture, religion, quantum physics and [[alternative medicine]].

== Supersensonics ==

Within the campus, Hills founded an experimental laboratory, managed by physicist Dr. Robert Massy,&lt;ref&gt;"Revealing Look Into World Of Luminous Revelations" - ''The Times, San Mateo'', September 22, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; to develop his theories on the Electro Vibratory Body – documenting what Hills' colleague Stanford University's [[William A. Tiller]] Ph.D,&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117924009/ | title=''What the #$*! Do We Know!?'' (Film review) |author=Robert Koehler |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=June 2, 2004 |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls "subtle energies" or "psychoenergetics". Shortly before he died [[radionics]] pioneer [[George de la Warr]] donated a substantial portion of his research files, library and instruments to Christopher Hills. In 1975 Hills wrote the book ''Supersensonics — the Science of Radiational Paraphysics'', widely considered "The Bible of dowsing"&lt;ref&gt;''Supersenonics - The Science of Radiational Paraphysics'', 0-916438-18-X (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The book sheds new light on divining, telepathy, [[The I Ching]], [[Egypt's Pyramids]], [[Biblical miracles]] and discusses the value of low level extrasensory phenomena vs higher levels of insight, wisdom and consciousness. ''[[New Age Journal]]'' magazine called ''Supersensonics'' "A short course in miracles for scientist and seeker alike."&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Age Journal]]'', July/August, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

== International philanthropy ==

With the [[Cold War]] in full swing liberation from the evils of totalitarianism was a constant theme in Hills writings. He lobbied hard against the [[KGB]]'s persecution of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the internal exile with police surveillance of [[Andrei Sakharov]] and the denial of an exit visa for [[Natan Sharansky]]'s emigration to Israel.[[File:Afghan Award to Christopher Hills.jpg|right|thumb|220px| Award presented to Christopher Hills for his humanitarian services during the [[Afghan-Soviet war]]]] Christopher Hills' lifelong crusade against dictatorships and Man's inhumanity was manifested in the book ''Rise of the Phoenix'' while his passionate beliefs against deficit spending were set forth in a book on the global economy — ''The Golden Egg''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Egg'' - 0-916438-32-5 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; A recurring theme throughout all Christopher Hills' approaches to world, local and family problems was a process he developed called "Creative Conflict" — the same principles of solving differences between individuals, political parties and even nations that Hills had debated with Adlai Stevenson, Nehru and Luis Kutner.

Throughout the seventies and eighties Hills focused on international affairs, particularly the emergence of democracy in the Soviet Republics, eventually traveling to Russia to meet with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] where he joined the [[Soviet Peace Committee]]. U.S. Presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] bestowed awards on Hills for his commitment to democratic freedom and his humanitarian support for victims of oppression.

The Christopher Hills Foundation donated more than $9 million worth of spirulina products to charitable organizations in the U.S. and abroad. When the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet Union had occupied Afghanistan]], Hills learned from his friends in Peshawar that Afghan freedom fighter [[Ahmad Shah Masoud]]'s mujahadeen troops as well as Tajik and [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribals were starving because supply routes had been cut by Russian forces. Hills donated and shipped $300,000 worth of spirulina, which was packed in by mules with help from Senator [[Charlie Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] to sustain the Afghans.&lt;ref&gt;Hills received a Humanitarian Award from the Afghan National Islamic Council, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Sri Lanka president [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]], struggling to find a formula to end the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], traveled to Boulder Creek to meet with Hills and learn more about his conflict resolution concepts. The two men shared a spiritual connection and established a close friendship. Premadasa then brought the Ceylon conflict closer to a democratic solution than any other Sri Lankan president had. However, the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] hierarchy had split and in 1993 a faction assassinated Premadasa in a suicide bombing that killed 23 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-03/news/mn-30648_1_tamil-rebels | work= Los Angeles Times| title=Assassination Clues Point to Tamil Rebels | date=3 May 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spirulina: food from sunlight==

Hills and Nakamura had a vision of feeding the world from lakes, seas and backyard aquaculture and in 1975 they authored a book, ''Food from Sunlight'' which published all their proprietary research as open source for the world to use in the cause against global famine and malnutrition. Their company, Microalgae International, invested in research and technology to find a super food for solving World Hunger. Early research focused on [[chlorella]] but its cellular structure was too small to be collected without expensive centrifuges. However, in 1967, while Dr Nakamura was living at Centre House, they discovered that women at [[Lake Chad]] were harvesting an algae in baskets to make dihé, a highly nutritious sun-baked biscuit. After studying the lakes of Africa, Hills and Dr Nakamura developed seed culture for a strain of 70% protein algae called [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] that they had collected from Lake Aranguachi in [[Ethiopia]]. Later, in 1981, Dr Hills made an expedition to Lake Chiltu at the invitation of Mr. Wollie Chekal, Minister of Trade for the Ethiopian Revolutionary Government and brought back a new set of spirulina samples to his California laboratory for hybridizing an optimal strain for commercial cultivation.

For millennia spirulina had been a food staple for natives of Lake Chad and also for the [[Aztecs]] but Hills funded much of the early experimentation needed for its successful modern day mass cultivation, described in Dr Nakamura's book ''Spirulina: Food for a Hungry World''.&lt;ref&gt;''Spirulina - Food for a Hungry World'', 0-916438-47-3&lt;/ref&gt;

To manufacture spirulina nutritional products Hills started the Light Force company in Santa Cruz, California, which was one of the early models for [[multi-level marketing]]. Customers began reporting weight loss and health benefits from spirulina and the success story was featured in ''[[The National Enquirer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Doctors Praise Safe Diet Pill" – ''National Enquirer'' (Cover), June 2, 1981, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Sales skyrocketed into the millions of dollars propelling Light Force to 50,000 distributors worldwide. To grow that much spirulina Hills formed joint ventures with Koor Foods in [[Eilat]], [[Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;Hills-Koor Red Sea Negev Algae Partnership - How to Feed the Hungry, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan Aqua in [[Taipei]] and Sosa Texcoco at [[Lake Texcoco]] in [[Mexico]]. Hills also had an association with Cyanotech on the [[Big Island of Hawaii]] which grew a very pure Pacifica brand of spirulina. By 1995 more than 5000 tons of spirulina a year were being imported for Light Force products. To encourage domestic research and production Hills purchased a 150-acre farm and built raceway ponds filled from the land's own natural geothermal aquifer in [[Desert Hot Springs, California]]. Professor Nakamura's student and protégé Dr Kotaro Kawaguchi relocated from Japan as chief research scientist and working with Sebastian Thomas, an algae cultivation expert from India, they refined desert-grown spirulina into consumable powder using the world's first {{convert|90000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} [[Solar dryer|solar heated dryer]].

While a staff of 40 ran the Southern California "Green Gold Farms," harvesting its own U.S.-grown spirulina for Light Force, Hills built a {{convert|13000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home/laboratory on a mountain in the redwoods of Boulder Creek, California, dedicated to researching [[neutraceuticals]] and as a gathering place for scientists, innovators and spiritual "map makers". Three years after moving to the new home Norah Hills died from [[Alzheimers]] eliciting an outpouring of affection from the many who had seen her as the "divine mother" and a significant force in all that Christopher Hills had achieved.

== Santa Cruz sanctuary ==

At the property he built a [[Hollywood]] quality video production studio to produce films on Enlightenment and, through new media, to inspire people to celebrate what he called the "Divine Goddess".&lt;ref&gt;''The Visionary State'' - 0-811848-35-3 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The studio is run today by his second wife, artist/producer [[Penny Slinger|Penny Slinger Hills]].

In 1996, after three decades of globetrotting, Hills visited [[Vietnam]] to invest in a naturally carbonated underground spring water venture. He contracted an obscure virus which caused a deterioration of his health. Light Force and the research company Biogenics were sold to Royal Body Care which continued to market the products.

Christopher Hills died at home January 31, 1997&lt;ref name="LA Times Obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-02-10/news/mn-27264_1_christopher-hills| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| title=Christopher Hills; Natural Foods Pioneer, Microbiologist | date=Feb 10, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving his wife Penny Slinger Hills, two sons, John Hills and Anthony Hills and four grandchildren. He believed that "Algae biomass was God's way of providing an inexhaustible source of energy from the sun". Today millions of health conscious people enjoy the health benefits of spirulina in myriad products worldwide. Recent innovations have moved algae to the front burner as researchers recognize its efficiency as a carbon sequestration mechanism and alternative biofuel.

Hills' legacy of bio-innovation and commitment to hunger relief is being carried forward by the Christopher Hills Foundation.

Rank comparison chart of naval forces of [[Commonwealth of Nations]] states.

Most of the 52 commonwealth nations have their beginnings in British Empire and have shared naval traditions. By comparison Mozambique is a former Portuguese colony. Even after some had achieved a degree of independent government from the UK, their naval protection was still British; the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] did not exist separately until 1941.

'''''Consumerist''''' (previously '''The Consumerist''') was a [[non-profit]] consumer affairs website owned by Consumer Media LLC, a subsidiary of ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', with content created by a team of full-time reporters and editors. The site's focus was on [[consumerism]] and consumers' experiences and issues with [[company|companies]] and [[corporation]]s, concentrating mostly on U.S. consumers. As an early proponent of crowdsourced journalism, some content was based on [[consumer generated media|reader-submitted tips and complaints]]. The majority of the site's articles consisted of original content and reporting by the site's staff. On October 30, 2017, ''Consumer Reports'' shut down ''Consumerist'', stating that coverage of consumer issues would now be found on the main Consumer Reports website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://consumerist.com/2017/10/30/please-pardon-the-interruption/ An important message from Consumer Reports]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Gawker Media]] established the site in December 2005,&lt;ref name="gelf"&gt;{{cite web | author=Carl Bialik | title=An Interview With the Consumerist | url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/archives/an_interview_with_the_consumerist.php | work=Gelf Magazine | date=December 25, 2005 | accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Joel Johnson as editor.&lt;ref name="nytwhat"&gt;{{cite news | author=Dan Mitchell | title=What's Online: Shoppers of the World, Unite | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/31/technology/shoppers-of-the-world-unite.html | work=The New York Times | date=31 December 2005 | accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson had previously edited [[Gizmodo]] for Gawker.  ''Consumerist'' was an idea from Gawker Media owner [[Nick Denton]] and managing editor Lockhart Steele; according to Johnson, "they knew they wanted a shopping blog—but not a shopping blog—and that they wanted to address the issues that consumers really find the most frustrating on a daily basis."

The idea of the site was based on a similar Hungarian blog called Tékozló Homár ("Wasteful Lobster" in Hungarian), which was initiated by Nick Denton's Hungarian friend, László Szily. "Tékozló Homár" is part of the Hungarian leading portal [[Index.hu|Index]].&lt;ref&gt;http://adowntownreporter.blogspot.hu/2007/04/q-with-ben-popken-editor-consumerist.html Q &amp; A with Ben Popken, Editor, The Consumerist (April 18, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In creating ''Consumerist'', Denton established its slogan and initial focus on readers' complaints, "consumer-oriented news nuggets, funny pictures and shopping tips&amp;nbsp;— all with the same [[wikt:snarky|snarky]] tone that characterizes Gawker properties like [[Wonkette]] and [[Gawker Media|Defamer]].".&lt;ref name="nytwhat"/&gt; Gawker hired [[Ben Popken]] to take over as site lead in February, 2006.  Johnson left Gawker in July 2006, citing a "disagreement about [his] role within the company."&lt;ref&gt;[http://joeljohnson.com/archives/2006/07/second-annual-g.html Second Annual Gawker Media Bug Out] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003022148/http://joeljohnson.com/archives/2006/07/second-annual-g.html |date=2009-10-03 }}, a July 21, 2006 joeljohnson.com blog entry&lt;/ref&gt;

Gawker put the site up for sale in November 2008, at the same time it announced the closure of one of its other blogs,'' [[Valleywag]]. Consumerist'' was purchased by Consumers Union, the publishers of ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', in December 2008.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/business/31consumer.html | work=The New York Times | title=Consumers Union to Buy Gawker Blog Consumerist | first=Stephanie | last=Clifford | date=31 December 2012| accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's two editors, site lead Ben Popken and senior editor Meghann Marco, were retained through the sale. Following the acquisition, Marco and Popken shared the title of Co-Executive Editor, and contributors Chris Walters and Carey Greenberg-Berger, who had been laid off by Gawker, were reinstated.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Due to potential [[conflict of interest]] concerns, ''Consumerist'' does not run display ads for outside advertisers; while owned by Gawker, all display ads linked to other Gawker sites, although the ''Consumerist'' sold text ads through the [[Google]] [[AdWords]] program. As such, the site was considered a [[loss leader]], whose primary business role was to help drive traffic to other revenue-producing Gawker sites. As an ad-free publication, ''Consumerist'' "has some freedom" to take on major national advertisers such as Comcast.&lt;ref name="philly"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.philly.com/2014-10-27/business/55451117_1_comcast-headquarters-comcast-executives-comcast-corp  | title=Watchdog in S. Phila. doesn't shrink from Comcast | date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Consumer Reports'' laid off Managing Editor Ben Popken in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Ben Popken | title=Goodbye to Consumerist.com | url=http://benpopkenwrites.com/post/12969722714/goodbye-to-consumerist-com | work=benpopkenwrites | date= | accessdate=24 February 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926003207/http://benpopkenwrites.com/post/12969722714/goodbye-to-consumerist-com | archivedate=26 September 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The departure was announced in a final blog post by Popken on Consumerist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://con.st/10024901 Ben Popken Says Farewell To Consumerist.com]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other editors have since joined the site, including Deputy Editor Chris Morran, Senior Editor Mary Beth Quirk, Assistant Editor Laura Northrup, Content Editor Kate Cox, and Special Projects Editor Ashlee Kieler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://consumerist.com/about-us-2/ | title=About Us | accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Consumerist'''s traffic remained steady throughout most of its existence. At the time it was acquired from Gawker, it had monthly traffic of approximately 10 million pageviews, and had similar levels as of 2014.&lt;ref name="philly"/&gt;

On August 30, 2017, ''The Wall Street Journal'' announced that it had appointed Meg Marco as its Editor, Digital Content Strategy, citing her history at ''Consumerist'', which it called "the innovative digital arm of Consumer Reports."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dowjones.com/press-room/wsj-appoints-meg-marco-editor-digital-content-strategy/|title=WSJ appoints Meg Marco Editor, Digital Content Strategy|date=2017-08-30|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2017 it was announced that no further posts to Consumerist.com would be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consumerist.com/2017/10/30/please-pardon-the-interruption/|title=An important message from Consumer Reports|date=2017-10-30|work=Consumerist|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
;"Friday Flickr Finds"
Usually the first post of every Friday consisting of reader submitted photos.

;"Great Moments In Commercial History"
A popular past feature was known as "Great Moments In Commercial History", which focused on strange and entertaining local commercials. Past feature "moments" have included [[Moo and Oink]] grocery stores ([[Chicago, Illinois]]) and Mr. Appliance ([[Eugene, Oregon]]).

;"Christmas Creep"
This feature publicized photos or stories of retail stores advertising Christmas sales, displaying Christmas decorations, or playing Christmas music far before the traditional holiday season, and often appeared between September and early November.

;"Above and Beyond"
In a post introducing "Above and Beyond", Creator Carey Greenberg-Berger said: "Occasionally, corporations do something right. Not all the time. Not most of the time. Occasionally. When they do, we want to give credit where credit is due."&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumerist.com/consumer/above-and-beyond/introducing-above-and-beyond-237647.php "Introducing Above And Beyond"], ''The Consumerist'', 18 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

;"Worst Company In America"
''Consumerist'' ran an annual "Worst Company In America" contest with the winner determined by a series of reader polls. The single-elimination tournament was similar in format to college basketball's [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|March Madness]] being held simultaneously. Companies that have advanced to the final four are included in the table below. The winning company was sent a "Golden [[feces|Poo]]" trophy. In recent years, silver and bronze poos have been sent to the other finalists.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This tournament was last held in 2014.

===Vincent Ferrari and AOL===
On June 13, 2006, [[Vincent Ferrari]] posted an audio file of himself speaking with an [[AOL]] representative, allegedly named John, as Ferrari tried to cancel his AOL account. The AOL representative initially resisted Ferrari's request by attempting to keep the discussion focused on Ferrari's reasons for wanting to cancel. Vincent asked the customer representative several times to close the account until the conversation became confrontational, at which point Ferrari adamantly stated, "Cancel the account!", repeatedly until John complied with his request. After recording this call, Ferrari both posted it to his blog and submitted it to ''Consumerist'' tip line. The AOL representative whom Vincent spoke to was fired from his job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-06-04-n80.html Vincent Ferrari, One of the New Influencers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from blogoscoped.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.callcentermagazine.com/blog/archives/2006/06/aol_customer_re.html ICMI/Call Center Magazine Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from callcentermagazine.com&lt;/ref&gt; ''Consumerist'' called the story "[t]he best story we ever posted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumerist.com/consumer/aol/the-best-thing-we-have-ever-posted-reader-tries-to-cancel-aol-180392.php The Best Thing We Have Ever Posted: Reader Tries To Cancel AOL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from consumerist.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "The Grocery Shrink Ray"{{anchor|grocery shrink ray}} ===
&lt;!-- This Anchor tag served to provide a permanent target for incoming section links. Please do not move it out of the section heading, even though it disrupted edit summary generation (you can manually fix the edit summary before saving your changes). Please do not modify it, even if you modify the section title. See [[Template:Anchor]] for details. (This text: [[Template:Anchor comment]]) --&gt;
The "grocery shrink ray" is a term Meghann Marco coined to describe the trend for groceries to be reduced in size while being sold at the same price point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grocery Shrink Ray |url=http://consumerist.com/tag/grocery-shrink-ray/ |work=Consumerist |publisher=Gawker Media |accessdate=2008-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714020538/http://consumerist.com/tag/grocery-shrink-ray/ |archivedate=2008-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers perform these reductions to reduce their own costs but do not pass any savings on to the customer. Installments of these articles usually included user submitted photographs of the product in question on the shelf, being sold along with a newer and slightly smaller version of the same product.  Local and national media outlets such as [[WTVT-TV]] FOX 13 in Florida, and [[National Public Radio]] have interviewed Popken regarding the trend and his attempts to inform the public at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Popken |first=Ben |title=Ben Popken on TV talking bout Shrinking Packages |url=http://consumerist.com/tag/media-whoring/?i=5018351&amp;t=ben-popken-on-tv-talking-bout-shrinking-packages |work=Consumerist |publisher=Gawker Media |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grocery Items: Same Price, Smaller Size |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92426936 |work=All Things Considered |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=2008-07-10 |accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facebook terms of service===
On February 15, 2009, ''Consumerist'' broke the news of a [[terms of service]] clause that gave [[Facebook]] the right to "Do anything they want with your content. Forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facebook's New Terms Of Service: "We Can Do Anything We Want With Your Content. Forever." |url=http://consumerist.com/5150175/facebooks-new-terms-of-service-we-can-do-anything-we-want-with-your-content-forever |work=Consumerist |publisher=Consumer Media LLC |accessdate=2009-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008202953/http://consumerist.com/5150175/facebooks-new-terms-of-service-we-can-do-anything-we-want-with-your-content-forever |archive-date=2009-10-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Zuckerberg]], CEO of Facebook, Inc., later claimed that a paragraph was accidentally left out saying that the license to your content was exclusive to one's privacy settings and that the license expired when an account was closed. This event instigated much media coverage over the controversy of the terms of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook Privacy Fallout Goes Nuclear|url=http://consumerist.com/5155538/facebook-privacy-fallout-goes-nuclear |work=Consumerist |publisher=Consumer Media LLC |accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closure ==
On October 30, 2017, ''Consumerist'' announced it was shutting down, and that coverage would be handled by Consumer Reports in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An important message from Consumer Reports|url=https://consumerist.com/2017/10/30/please-pardon-the-interruption/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crowds and Power''''' ({{lang-de|Masse und Macht}}) is a 1960 book by [[Elias Canetti]], dealing with the dynamics of [[crowd]]s and "packs" and the question of how and why crowds obey [[power (social and political)|power]] of rulers. Canetti draws a parallel between ruling and paranoia. Also, the memoirs of [[Daniel Paul Schreber]] are analyzed with an implicit critique of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Gustave Le Bon]].

The book was translated from German into English by Carol Stewart in 1962 and published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]].

It is notable for its unusual tone; although wide-ranging in its erudition, it is not scholarly or academic in a conventional way. Rather, it reads like a manual written by someone outside the human race explaining to [[alterity|another]] outsider in concise and highly metaphoric language how people form mobs and manipulate power. Unlike much non-fiction writing, it is highly poetic and seething with anger.

On asking questions:
"On the questioner the effect is a feeling of enhanced power. He enjoys this and consequentially asks more and more questions; every answer he receives is an act of [[submission]]. Personal freedom consists largely in having a defense against questions. The most blatant tyranny is the one which asks the most blatant questions."&lt;ref&gt;''Crowds and Power,'' p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

This work remains important for the insights it provided into the [[Revolutions of 1989|Eastern European upheaval]] which can be understood within the framework Canetti puts forth.&lt;ref&gt;''Kiss (2004)'', p.730&lt;/ref&gt; Showing the growth of crowds and their power against even the power of the state.

A '''document''' is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of [[thought]]. The word originates from the Latin ''documentum'', which denotes a "teaching" or "lesson": the verb ''doceō'' denotes "to teach". In the past, the word was usually used to denote a written proof useful as evidence of a truth or fact. In the [[computer age]], "document" usually denotes a primarily textual [[computer file]], including its structure and format, e.g. fonts, colors, and [[Computer-generated imagery|images]]. Contemporarily, "document" is not defined by its [[transmission medium]], e.g., paper, given the existence of [[electronic document]]s. "Documentation" is distinct because it has more denotations than "document". Documents are also distinguished from "[[Realia (library science)|realia]]", which are three-dimensional objects that would otherwise satisfy the definition of "document" because they memorialize or represent thought; documents are considered more as 2 dimensional representations. While documents are able to have large varieties of customization, all documents are able to be shared freely, and have the right to do so, creativity can be represented by documents, also. History, events, examples, opinion, etc. all can be expressed in documents. 

==Abstract definitions==
The concept of "document" has been defined by [[Suzanne Briet]] as "any concrete or symbolic indication, preserved or recorded, for reconstructing or for proving a phenomenon, whether physical or mental."&lt;ref&gt;Briet. 1951. 7. Quoted in Buckland, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

An often cited article concludes that "the evolving notion of ''document''" among Jonathan Priest, [[Paul Otlet|Otlet]], Briet, [[Walter Schürmeyer|Schürmeyer]], and the other [[documentalist]]s increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document rather than traditional physical forms of documents. The shift to digital technology would seem to make this distinction even more important. [[David M. Levy|Levy's]] thoughtful analyses have shown that an emphasis on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents (e.g., Levy, 1994&lt;ref&gt;Levy, D. M. "Fixed or Fluid? Document Stability and New Media." 1994. In ''European Conference on Hypertext Technology 1994 Proceedings'', pp. 24–31. New York: Association for Computing Machinery. Retrieved 18 October 2011 from 
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.119.8813&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;). A conventional document, such as a mail message or a technical report, exists physically in digital technology as a string of bits, as does everything else in a digital environment. As an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence by those who study it.

"Document" is defined in [[library and information science]] and [[documentation science]] as a fundamental, abstract idea: the word denotes everything that may be represented or memorialized in order to serve as evidence. The classic example provided by [[Suzanne Briet]] is an [[antelope]]: "An antelope running wild on the plains of Africa should not be considered a document[;] she rules. But if it were to be captured, taken to a zoo and made an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence being used by those who study it. Indeed, scholarly articles written about the antelope are secondary documents, since the antelope itself is the primary document."&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, M. "What Is a Digital Document?" 1998. In ''Document Numérique'' Paris. 2(2). [http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/digdoc.html].&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion has been interpreted as an early expression of [[actor–network theory]].

==Kinds==
Documents are sometimes classified as [[Classified information|secret]], [[Privacy|private]], or public. They may also be described as [[Draft document|drafts]] or [[Proofreading|proofs]]. When a document is [[Copying|copied]], the source is denominated the "[[Originality|original]]".

Standards are accepted for specific applications in various fields, e.g.:
* Academia: [[manuscript]], [[thesis]], [[Academic publishing|paper]], and [[Academic journal|journal]]
* Business: [[invoice]], [[Financial quote|quote]], [[RFP]], [[Proposal (business)|proposal]], [[contract]], [[packing slip]], [[Ship's manifest|manifest]], [[report]] (detailed and summary), [[spread sheet]], [[MSDS]], [[waybill]], [[bill of lading]] (BOL), [[financial statement]], [[nondisclosure agreement]] (NDA), mutual nondisclosure agreement (MNDA), and user guide
* [[Government]], [[law]], and [[politics]]: [[Patent application|application]], [[brief (law)|brief]], [[certificate (disambiguation)#Official document|certificate]], [[Commission (document)|commission]], [[Constitutional documents|constitutional document]], [[Form (document)|form]], [[gazette]], [[identity document]], [[license]], [[summons]], and [[white paper]]
* Media: [[mock-up]] and [[screenplay|script]]

Such standard documents can be drafted based on a [[Template (word processing)|template]].

==Drafting==
The [[page layout]] of a document is the manner in which information is graphically arranged in the space of the document, e.g., on a page. If the appearance of the document is of concern, page layout is generally the responsibility of a [[graphic design]]er. [[Typography]] concerns the design of letter and symbol forms and their physical arrangement in the document (see [[typesetting]]). [[Information design]] concerns the effective communication of [[information]], especially in industrial documents and public [[sign]]s. Simple textual documents may not require visual design and may be drafted only by an [[author]], [[Data entry clerk|clerk]], or [[transcriber]]. [[Form (document)|Forms]] may require a visual design for their initial fields, but not to complete the forms.

==History==
[[File:LL Zamenhof birth certificate.jpg|thumb|A birth certificate from 1859]]
Traditionally, the medium of a document was [[paper]] and the information was applied to it in [[ink]], either by hand writing (to make a [[manuscript]]) or by mechanical process (e.g., a [[printing press]] or [[laser printer]]). Today, some short documents also may consist of sheets of paper [[Staple (fastener)|stapled]] together.

Historically, documents were inscribed with [[ink]] on [[papyrus]] (starting in ancient [[Egypt]]) or [[parchment]]; scratched as [[runes]] or carved on stone using a sharp tool, e.g., the [[Tablets of Stone]] described in the [[Bible]]; stamped or incised in [[clay]] and then baked to make [[clay tablet]]s, e.g., in the [[Sumer]]ian and other [[Mesopotamia]]n civilizations. The [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] was often rolled into a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]] or cut into sheets and [[Bookbinding|bound]] into a [[codex]] (book).

Contemporary electronic means of memorializing and displaying documents include:
* [[Computer display|Monitor]] of a [[desktop computer]], [[laptop]], [[tablet computer|tablet PC]], et cetera; optionally with a [[computer printer|printer]] to produce a [[hard copy]];
* [[Personal digital assistant]] (PDA);
* Dedicated [[e-book device]];
* [[Electronic paper]], typically, using the [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF);
* [[Information appliance]];
* [[Digital audio player]]; and
* [[Radio]] and [[television]] [[Telecommunications Service Provider|service provider]].

Digital documents usually require a specific [[file format]] in order to be presentable in a specific medium.

== In law ==
Documents in all forms frequently serve as material [[evidence]] in criminal and civil proceedings. The [[forensic]] analysis of such a document is within the scope of [[questioned document examination]]. For the purpose of cataloging and managing the large number of documents that may be produced during [[litigation]], [[Bates numbering]] is often applied to all documents in the lawsuit so that each document has a unique, arbitrary, identification number.

A '''domain hack''' is a [[domain name]] that suggests a word, phrase, or name when [[concatenating]] two or more adjacent levels of that domain.&lt;ref name="domainhacks"&gt;[http://xona.com/2004/11/03.html Domain Hacks &amp; Email Hacks] (original domain hack article)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dynadot.com/community/blog/2012/12/domain-hacks-fun.html|title=Domain Hacks = Fun Domain Name Opportunities|work=Dynadot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://morganlinton.com/startup-domain-faq-should-i-use-a-domain-hack|title=Startup Domain FAQ – Should I Use A Domain Hack?|work=morganlinton.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, {{mono|&lt;nowiki&gt;"bir.ds"&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} and {{mono|&lt;nowiki&gt;"examp.le"&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, using the fictitious country-code domains ''.ds'' and ''.le'', suggest the words ''birds'' and ''example'' respectively. In this context, the word ''[[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hack]]'' denotes a clever trick (as in [[Computer programming|programming]]), not an exploit or break-in (as in [[Computer security|security]]).

Domain hacks offer the ability to produce short domain names. This makes them potentially valuable as redirectors, [[pastebin]]s, base domains from which to delegate [[subdomains]] and [[URL shortening]] services.

==History==
On November 23, 1992, {{mono|inter.net}} was registered.&lt;ref&gt;Whois domain search [http://reports.internic.net/cgi/whois?whois_nic=inter.net&amp;type=domain inter.net WHOIS record]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, several [[hostname]]s ending in "pla.net" were active. The concept of spelling out a phrase with the parts of a [[hostname]] to form a domain hack became well established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linuxmafia.com/pub/humour/coolhosts.html |title=List of coolest hostnames and domain hacks circa 1995 |publisher=Linuxmafia.com |date= |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday, May 3, 2002, {{mono|icio.us}} was registered to create {{mono|[[Delicious (website)|del.icio.us]]}}. Delicious would later gain control of the delicio.us domain, which had been [[Domain parking|park]]ed since April 24, 2002, the day the .us ccTLD ([[country code top-level domain]]) was opened to second-level registrations.

[[Who.is]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Who.is|title=WHOIS Search, Domain Name, Website, and IP Tools|work=who.is}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[whois]] lookup service, indicating the registered ownership information of a domain. It was established June 12, 2002 and registered to an address in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]].

On January 14, 2004, the [[Christmas Island Internet Administration]] revoked [[.cx]] domain registration for [[shock site]] [[goatse.cx]], a domain which used "se.cx" to form the word "sex".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cocca.cx/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3 Council of Country Code Administrators - Acceptable Use Policy .cx - Christmas Island]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021013937/http://cocca.cx/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3 |date=October 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The domain was originally registered in 1999. Similar names had been used for parody sites such as oralse.cx or analse.cx; in some cases, [[.cz]] ([[Czech Republic]]) or [[.kz]] ([[Kazakhstan]]) are substituted for [[.cx]].

The term ''domain hack'' was coined by [[Matthew Doucette]] on November 3, 2004 to mean "an unconventional domain name that uses parts other than the SLD (second level domain) or third level domain to create the title of the domain name."&lt;ref&gt;[http://xona.com/domainhacks/info.html Domain Hacks Information] (original domain hack search)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yahoo!]] acquired {{mono|[[blo.gs]]}}&lt;ref&gt;Winstead, Jim. [http://blo.gs/for-sale.php blo.gs: sold] June 14, 2005.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309092950/http://blo.gs/for-sale.php |date=March 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on June 14, 2005, and {{mono|del.icio.us}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903074705/http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html|title=y.ah.oo!|last=Schachter|first=Joshua|website=delicious blog|date=December 9, 2005|archivedate=September 3, 2011|accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on December 9, 2005.

On September 11, 2007, [[name server]]s for [[.me]] were delegated by [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] to the Government of [[Montenegro]], with a two-year transition period for existing [[.yu]] names to be transferred to [[.me]]. One of the first steps taken in deploying [[.me]] online was to create [[.me|.its.me]] as a domain space for personal sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnxpert.com/2007/11/08/montenegro-me-tld-to-attract-interest-for-domain-hacks |title=Montenegro .me tld to attract interest for domain hacks |publisher=Dnxpert.com |date=November 8, 2007 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many potential domain hacks, such as ''love.me'' and ''buy.me'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nic.me/news.php?news=102|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825105659/http://www.nic.me/news.php?news=102|title=Going Once, Going Twice – Top .ME Names Up For Bid|website=Domain.ME|date=September 22, 2008|archivedate=August 25, 2009|accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; were held back by the registry as premium names for later auction. One .me domain hack example is {{mono|please.do.not.disturb.me}}.

On December 15, 2009 [[Google]] launched its own [[URL shortener]] under the domain {{mono|goo.gl}} using the ccTLD of [[Greenland]]. [[YouTube]] subsequently launched {{mono|youtu.be}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube-global.blogspot.dk/2009/12/make-way-for-youtube-links.html|title=Make Way for youtu.be Links|website=Youtube Official Blog|archivedate=December 21, 2009|accessdate=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the ccTLD of [[Belgium]].  In 2015 Google used the domain hack abc.xyz for their newly launched [[Alphabet Inc.]].

In March 2010, [[National Public Radio]] launched its own URL shortener under the domain {{mono|n.pr}} using the ccTLD of [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Carvin, Daniel Jacobson and Jon Foreman |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/inside/2010/03/you_say_npr_but_on_twitter_we.html |title=You Say NPR, But On Twitter We Say n.pr |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The n.pr domain is currently used to link to an NPR story page by its ID and is one of the shortest possible domain hacks.

In late 2010, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] launched a URL shortener at the domain {{mono|itun.es}}, using the ccTLD of [[Spain]], in a similar move to Google's goo.gl. Unlike goo.gl, which is public and can be used for any web address, itun.es is used only for [[iTunes Ping]] URL shortening.

Spotify also uses the [[URL Shortener]] {{mono|spoti.fi}}, using the ccTLD of [[Finland]], to link to artist, partners, playlists, albums and songs.

Flickr uses {{mono|flic.kr}} with .kr being the ccTLD of [[South Korea]].

==International names==
In most cases, registration of these short domain names relies on the use of [[country code top-level domain]]s (ccTLDs), each of which has a unique two-letter identifier.

For example, {{mono|[[blo.gs]]}} makes use of the ccTLD [[.gs]] ([[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]) to spell "blogs", {{mono|fa.st}} makes use of the ccTLD [[.st]] ([[São Tomé and Príncipe]]) to spell "fast", {{mono|every.one}} uses the [[.one (domain)|.one]] [[Generic_top-level domain|gTLD]] to spell "everyone", {{mono|[[Instagr.am]]}} makes use of the ccTLD [[.am]] ([[Armenia]]) to spell the name of photo-sharing service "Instagram", {{mono|helpmelearn.it}} makes use of the ccTLD [[.it]] ([[Italy]]) to spell "help me learn it", {{mono|sexyi.am}} uses ccTLD [[.am]] ([[Armenia]]) and {{mono|darkvir.us}} uses ccTLD [[.us]] ([[United States]]) and sharing it for subdomains with free hosting, {{mono|[[television|tel.ly]]}} uses ccTLD [[.ly]] ([[Libya]]) to spell "telly" (a popular British colloquial term for television), and some of [[Imageboard#Danbooru-style boards|Danbooru-style imageboards]] that end their name with '-booru' [[suffix]] may use the ccTLD [[.ru]] ([[Russia]]) to spell their own name.&lt;!-- Derpibooru (derpiboo.ru) was one of the cases, but it is slowly abandoning the .ru domain in the protest against Russian authority's blocking of the website. --&gt;

The [[subdomain|third-level domains]] {{mono|[[Delicious (website)|del.icio.us]]}}, {{mono|[[Daniel J. Bernstein|cr.yp.to]]}} and {{mono|e.xplo.it}} make use of the [[second-level domain|SLDs]] {{mono|icio.us}}, {{mono|yp.to}} and {{mono|xplo.it}} from the ccTLDs [[.us]] ([[United States]]), [[.to]] ([[Tonga]]) and [[.it]] ([[Italy]]) to spell "delicious", "crypto" and "exploit" respectively.

In some cases, an entire ccTLD has been re-purposed in its international marketing, such as [[.am]] ([[Armenia]]), [[.fm]] ([[Federated States of Micronesia]]), [[.cd]] ([[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), [[.dj]] ([[Djibouti]]), and [[.tv]] ([[Tuvalu]]) for sites delivering various forms of audiovisual content.

[[Libya|Libya's]] ccTLD ([[.ly]]) has been used for English words that end with suffix "ly", such as sil.ly. Popular URL shortening services bit.ly, brief.ly, name.ly and ow.ly use this hack. In 2010, Libyan registry suspended an adult oriented [[.ly]] link shortener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2370354,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | first=Leslie | last=Horn | title=Libya Seizes URL Shortener Vb.ly | date=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|ccTLD#Unconventional usage}}

==Other languages==
In [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]] the domain [[.ag#Hacks|.ag]] for [[Antigua and Barbuda]] is used by [[corporation]]s in the legal form of [[Aktiengesellschaft]] (commonly abbreviated as AG).

The [[American Samoa]] domain [[.as]] is popular in the handful of countries where A/S is the legal suffix for [[corporation]]s.

Some organisations situated in [[Switzerland]] use TLDs to specifically refer to their [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] (such as the [[Belgium|Belgian]] TLD [[.be]] for the [[Canton of Berne]]).

In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], "[[.biz|biz]]" means "we", and can be used for emphasis at the end of "we are" sentences.

[[Family name]]s in many [[Slavic languages]] written in internationalized variant end with ''ch'' (i.e. -ich, -vich, -vych, -ovich). This ''ch'' comes from Slavic "ć", "č", "ч", or "ћ". Therefore, the Swiss [[.ch]] [[ccTLD]] is an option. Another use case of .ch is for English words that end in ''ch'', e.g. tech, punch, search, crunch, rich. Examples of such domains are {{mono|codesear.ch}}, {{mono|freshte.ch}}, and {{mono|swit.ch}}.

Since the introduction of [[.eu]] domains (''eu'' meaning "I" in Romanian, Galician and Portuguese), these domains have become popular in Romania, with people registering their names with the .eu extension.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], « là » or « lá » mean "there". As the [[.la]] domain ([[Laos]]) is available for second-level registration worldwide, this can be an easy way to get a short, catchy name such as "go there". In Italy some TLDs are identical to Italian Provinces' identifier, such as .to ([[Turin]]) or .tv ([[Treviso]]) and are thus extensively used for web domains in the area. The [[Canada|Canadian]] domain [[.ca]] is also trivial to use as « cá » or « cà »  ("here"), respectively in Portuguese and [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], or « ça » ("that"), in [[French language|French]]; local Canadian presence is required.

[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] domains sometimes use the Moroccan top level domain [[.ma]] (meaning "today"). The [[Moldova]]n domain, [[.md]], is used by doctors and medical companies, such as doctors.md, after a legal fight to allow such usage outside of Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Norbut|first1=Mike|title=New company makes push for ".md" domain|url=http://www.amednews.com/article/20050117/business/301179991/7/|accessdate=May 21, 2015|work=American Medical News|date=January 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fad amongst French-speakers was to register their names in the [[Niue]] TLD [[.nu]], which in [[French language|French]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] means "nude" or "naked"; however, {{As of|2007|lc=on}}, Niue authorities have revoked many of these domain names. The handful that remain are joke domains without actual nudity. French speakers often use the [[Jersey]] TLD [[.je]], since "je" means "I" in French. In addition, [[.je]] is used in the Netherlands, as it can mean both "you" or "your", and "small", since the addition of -je to most nouns produces a diminutive form (e.g. huis.je, or the defunct iPhone app feest.je (feestje meaning "party").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oosterveer|first1=Danny|title=Feest.je gooit handdoek in de ring|url=http://www.marketingfacts.nl/berichten/feest.je-gooit-handdoek-in-de-ring|accessdate=May 21, 2015|work=marketingfacts.nl|date=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, Dutch, Swedish, and Danish speakers sometimes use .nu, because it means "now" in these languages. The TLD is still used by many Swedish sites, as prior to 2003 it was impossible for individuals (and difficult for organizations) to register arbitrary domains under the [[.se]] TLD.

In [[Russian language|Russian]], ''net'' (as ''нет'', or ''nyet'' transliterated character for character) means ''no'', so there are many domains in the format ''something.net'' (e.g. redaktora.net meaning ''no editor''). There is a plenty of words ending with ''ga'' («га»), including some highly popular (''книга'' meaning ''book'', ''дорога'' meaning ''road''). Domain .ga of Gabon is free for registration which catalyzed speed of these domains' registration. 

In [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]], ''to'' means "it", so there are many domains using [[Tonga]]'s [[.to]] in the format "do-something.to" (e.g., zrobie.to, meaning "I will do it" in the [[Polish language]] or prestahujeme.to meaning "We will move it" as Slovak moving service). Notably, Czech file sharing service uloz.to was founded in 2007, and its name "ulož to" means "save it".

In [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], ''si'' is a dative form of the reciprocal personal pronoun and a second person form of the verb ''to be''. As [[.si]] is a Slovenian [[ccTLD]], domain hacks are abundant. Additionally, the domain is attractive to speakers of [[Romance languages]], because it is a conjunction, pronoun or an affirmative interjection in many. [[ARNES]] limits the use of the domain to residents and entities of Slovenia.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''ar'' is the ending of the infinitive of many verbs, so hacks with Argentina's TLD [[.ar]] are common (e.g. educ.ar, meaning "to educate").

One of the earliest commercial [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s in [[Finland]] used the domain sci[[.fi]] &amp;mdash; a reference to [[science fiction]].

In [[Latin]], many second-declension nouns in the nominative singular case end in the suffix -us, which is echoed in the TLD .us. So it is possible to create Latin-word domain names, such as obscur.us, which resembles the Latin word obscurus, which means dark, obscure, or unknown.

Some registries allow [[Emoji]] in domains, permitting the creation of [[Emoji domain|emoji domains]]. Many browsers display these domains as [[punycode]] for security reasons.

With the rise of [[Proposed top-level domain|new TLDs]], some companies have registered entire [[TLD]]s in order to create a hack for their name. Most prominent is [[.gle]], created for [[Google]] to be used as goo.gle.

==Other variations==

Other variations of domain name hacking include [[ambigram]] names, which when rotated 180° look exactly the same.

'''''Epistulae ad Atticum''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Letters to [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]]") is a collection of letters from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] politician and orator [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] to his close friend [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]]. The letters in this collection, together with Cicero's other letters, are considered the most reliable sources of information for the period leading up to the fall of the [[Roman Republic]]. The letters to Atticus are special among Cicero's works in that they provide a candid view into his personal character — containing confession, frank self-revelation, and a record of his moods from day to day, without alteration. Traditionally spanning 16 books, the collection features letters from 68 to 44&amp;nbsp;BCE. A notable absence of early references to these particular letters suggest that they may not have been published until the middle of the first century CE, significantly later than Cicero's other letters and quite some time after the deaths of both Cicero (43&amp;nbsp;BCE) and Atticus (32&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Shackleton Bailey |editor-first=D. R. |editor-link=D. R. Shackleton Bailey |date=April 1999 |title=Letters to Atticus |volume=I |url=http://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL007/1999/volume.xml |publisher=Harvard University Press |access-date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Cicero}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A manuscript containing the collection, along with ''[[Epistulae ad Quintum Fratrem]]'', and ''[[Epistulae ad Brutum]]'', was rediscovered in 1345 in [[Verona]] by [[Petrarch]].  Both the original and Petrarch's copy are lost, though a copy made for [[Coluccio Salutati]] is preserved in the [[Laurentian Library]] in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cicero: Selected Letters |last=Abbott |first=Frank Frost |author-link=Frank Frost Abbott |date=1909 |publisher=Ginn and Co. |location=Boston |at=§68 |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0076%3Atext%3Dintro%3Achapter%3D7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1332">In [[mathematics]], '''&lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;-induction''' ('''epsilon-induction''') is a variant of [[transfinite induction]] that can be used in [[axiomatic set theory|set theory]] to prove that all [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] satisfy a given property ''P''[''x''].  If the truth of the property for ''x'' follows from its truth [[for all]] elements of ''x'', for every set ''x'', then the property is true of all sets.  In symbols:

: ''&lt;math&gt;\forall x \Big(\forall y (y \in x \rightarrow P[y]) \rightarrow P[x]\Big) \rightarrow \forall x \, P[x]&lt;/math&gt;''

This principle, sometimes called the '''axiom of induction''' (in set theory), is equivalent to the [[axiom of regularity]] given the other [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] axioms.  &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;-induction is a special case of [[well-founded relation#Induction and recursion|well-founded induction]]. The Axiom of Foundation (regularity) implies epsilon-induction.

The name is most often pronounced "epsilon-induction", because the set membership symbol &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; historically developed from the Greek letter &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;.

==History==
The company was incorporated in December 1922 as Trade and Travel Publications Ltd.&lt;ref name=coho&gt;[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk Companies House Webcheck] Company number 186564&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South American Handbook ===
{{main|South American Handbook}}
In 1924 the company published the South American Handbook, a new edition of a guide for business travellers first published in 1921 by the [[Federation of British Industry]] and entitled the ''Anglo-South American Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, ''Koebel, William Henry''&lt;/ref&gt;

The handbook remained the company's only guidebook for the next 65 years.  Over the years the handbook expanded its coverage to include all the countries of South America, Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean.  It continued to include data for businessmen, but by the 1970s was increasingly aimed at leisure travellers, particularly backpackers following the [[Gringo Trail]].  In 1989 the 65th edition was almost 1400 pages long.

In 1990 the handbook was split.  The ''Mexico &amp; Central America Handbook'' and the ''Caribbean Islands Handbook'' were published as separate volumes, and during the 1990s the company started developing a new travel guide series using the South American Handbook title as the flagship.

=== Footprint imprint ===
Trade and Travel Publications changed its name to Footprint Handbooks Ltd in August 1996.&lt;ref name=coho/&gt;  By 1997 there were over a dozen guides in the series.

The series grew quickly and in 2004, Footprint launched its first thematic guide: ''Surfing Europe''. This was followed by further thematic guides such as ''Diving the World'', ''Snowboarding the World'', ''Body and Soul escapes'', ''Travel with Kids'' and ''European City Breaks''. In 2013 a brand new series, ''Footprint Dream Trip'', was launched.

==Official History==
The official history of the company, is included in the majority of Footprint’s publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footprinttravelguides.com/c/1441/footprint-story/ The Footprint Story]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gault et Millau''' {{IPA-fr|ɡo e mijo|}} is a French [[restaurant guide]]. It was founded by two restaurant critics, [[Henri Gault]] and [[Christian Millau]] in 1965.

==Points system==
Gault Millau rates on a scale of 1 to 20, with 20 being the highest. Restaurants given below 10 points are rarely listed. The points are awarded based on the quality of the food, with comments about service, price or the atmosphere of the restaurant given separately. Based on this rating, high-ranking restaurants may display one to five [[toque (French)|toque]]s.  Gault Millau does not accept payment for listing restaurants.

Under its original authors and for many years after they left, Gault Millau never awarded a score of 20 points, under the argument that perfection is beyond the limitations of a normal human being. In 2004, two restaurants, both of chef [[Marc Veyrat]], the Maison de Marc Veyrat (or L'Auberge de l'Eridan) in [[Veyrier-du-Lac]] near [[Annecy]] and [[La Ferme de Mon Père]] ("My Father's Farm") in [[Megève]], received this score. To some, this reflects a fall of standards in the guide after it changed from employing a permanent editorial  and tasting staff to using local agents.

==Differences with Michelin==
There has been discussion about which guide is more important, the [[Michelin Guide]] or the Gault Millau. In the 1970s the Michelin's continued conservative support of traditional [[haute cuisine]] was challenged by the support of [[nouvelle cuisine]] by the Gault-Millau.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Hughes, Keith A. Reader&gt; Encyclopedia of Contemporary French Culture - 1998 Page 467 "Michelin was long associated with the rich traditional style of la haute cuisine, to which the polemical embracing of nouvelle cuisine by the Guide Gault-Millau (founded in 1972) represented something of a riposte."&lt;/ref&gt;  Michelin is more popular and therefore more influential, while Gault Millau has been considered more purist due to the main system being based purely on the quality of the food. Gault Millau also has guides for various other countries, including [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] &amp; [[Luxembourg]], [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], and [[Poland]].

'''Heed Their Rising Voices''' is a 1960 newspaper advertisement published in the ''[[New York Times]]''.  It was published on March 29, 1960 and paid for by the "Committee to Defend Martin Luther King and the Struggle for Freedom in the South".  The purpose of the advertisement was to draw attention and support towards [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] A recent felony charge of perjury was leveled against him and could have resulted in a lengthy imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State of Alabama v.

'''Internet Domain Name Index''' (IDNX) is a [[price index]] for Internet [[domain name]]s that tracks changes in the value of domains at the [[aggregate data|aggregate level]]. The index builds on the premise that domain names are comparable to [[real estate development#Land development|developable land]]. Domains are seen as "locations" on the Internet where companies or individuals can set up a business or just a personal homepage. This core analogy warrants the transfer of theoretical and empirical frameworks from academic real estate research to Internet domains as "virtual land".&lt;ref&gt;Lindenthal, Thies. 2011. ''On Rushes and Riches: The "Wild West" Era for Internet Domain Names Is Over as Efficient Markets for This "Virtual Land" Have Emerged'', http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/08/24/on-rushes-and-riches-the-wild-west-era-for-internet-domain-names-is-over-as-efficient-markets-for-this-virtual-land-have-emerged/
&lt;/ref&gt;

The period covered by IDNX reaches back to January 2006. Internet domain name prices exhibit a strong correlation to the IT{{Clarify|date=December 2012}} stocks as measured by the NASDAQ index. When the IT industry is doing well, prices of domain names tend to rise. In periods of falling stock prices, domains prices usually fall as well. This co-movement shows that domain names are not an asset class on their own, but that the "real" and the "virtual" economy are closely linked.&lt;ref&gt;* Booton, Jennifer. 2011. ''Could Domain Names Predict the Next Recession?'', Fox Business, http://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/2011/07/13/could-domain-names-predict-next-recession/&lt;/ref&gt;

IDNX is estimated in two steps. First, a [[hedonic regression#hedonic repeat sales regression|hedonic repeat sales regression]] gives 12 annual price indices, all starting at different months of the year. By looking at repeat sales of similar domains, the inherent quality of the domains is controlled for. In a second step, these staggered annual indices are converted to a monthly index using a frequency conversion technique &lt;ref&gt;S. Bokhari and D. Geltner. 2010. ''Estimating Real Estate Price Movements for High Frequency Tradable Indexes in a Scarce Data Environment'', Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; developed by David Geltner and Sheharyar Bokhari (both from [[MIT]]). First estimating indexes at the annual frequency and later converting them to monthly numbers reduces the volatility in index estimates without imposing an explicit time-structure.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenthal, Thies. 2011. ''Valuable Words: Pricing Internet Domain Names'', Working Paper, 2011, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1885465&lt;/ref&gt;

The empirical estimations are based on a large data set of more than 200,000 (as of October 2011) real domain transactions facilitated by the domain market place [[Sedo]].

IDNX was launched in July 2011 by [[Thies Lindenthal]].&lt;ref&gt;Th. Lindenthal holds a PhD in Real Estate Finance from [[Maastricht University]], The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Journeys of Frodo: An Atlas of J. R. R. Tolkien's'' The Lord of the Rings''' by [[Barbara Strachey]] is an [[Atlas (cartography)|atlas]] based on the [[fictional realm]] of [[Middle-earth]], which traces the journeys undertaken by the [[Fictional character|characters]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings|epic]].

The book comprises 51 two-colour [[map]]s (a general map of Middle-earth and 50 numbered maps) at various scales, all based on the original ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' maps drawn by [[Christopher Tolkien]] from his father's sketches. Each map is on a right-hand page in [[landscape format]] and depicts physical features in black and contour lines in red. Routes taken by characters on roads and paths are shown in dashed black and red; routes off-road are in red only. Arrows show the direction of travel and dates are listed in red. Scales along the top and left of each map show the distance east/west (mainly east) and north/south (mainly south) from [[Bag End]]. At the bottom of each map is a scale showing miles to the inch and an indication of the [[lunar phase]] or phases visible at the dates given.

Each numbered map is accompanied by a description on the facing left-hand page, in which Strachey describes the portion of the route indicated, often justifying her topographical decisions with quotes from the book. In some cases she points out discrepancies in the topographical descriptions, occasionally for instance altering the course of a road or a river on the grounds that it would otherwise be inconsistent with Tolkien's other descriptions of the terrain.

Christopher Tolkien refers to ''Journeys of Frodo'' a number of times in ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]'', often agreeing with Strachey's conclusions, and sometimes disagreeing.

'''Life Beyond Tourism'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifebeyondtourism.org&lt;/ref&gt;  (in short LBT) is a [[nonprofit]] worldwide portal free of banners, based in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The portal dates back to 2008 and stems from an orientation by the [[Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation]]. The portal is an international platform for exchange of experiences and good practices in the framework of a [[tourism]] based on values and not only on services and consumerism.

==History==

The portal originates from an orientation of the [[Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation]]. In 20 years of activity, the Foundation elaborated a new concept of the [[cultural heritage]] as an instrument of understanding among cultures. According to this orientation, [[cultural heritage]] is not only to be safeguarded and enhanced, but also to be “used and enjoyed” to foster intercultural dialogue.
In September 2008 the [[Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation]] announced the establishment of the association Life Beyond Tourism for Intercultural Dialogue. Soon after, a Declaration of Intents &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifebeyondtourism.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/imported/Declaration%20of%20Intents%20with%20Signatories(1).pdf |title=Declaration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215190757/http://www.lifebeyondtourism.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/imported/Declaration%20of%20Intents%20with%20Signatories%281%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was signed (March 2008) by 59 experts of the Foundation from 20 different countries. In February 2011 the association developed the Life Beyond Tourism Non-Profit Portal. 
According to the LBT Manifesto &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifebeyondtourism.org/en/488-2/|title=Manifesto}}&lt;/ref&gt; “the tourist is a potential harbinger of knowledge and of intercultural dialogue” and therefore “the tourist destination is a workshop of knowledge, providing all visitors with an opportunity for cultural growth”
The Province of Florence welcomed the LBT orientation and decided to promote it. Many other cultural institutions and public administrations in Central Europe and Eurasia also joined the initiative.

===Main features===
Life Beyond Tourism gathers the cultural expressions representing a given region to provide a good picture of its “cultural personality” resulting from the interaction between its [[cultural heritage]] and ongoing developments.  The aim of the portal is to convey a territory’s specific features and to emphasize the way in which tangible and intangible heritage is combined to human and environmental levels.  
The portal is addressed to all cultural institutions, companies, professional and individuals who share the philosophy of the portal. In particular there are some typologies of members:
* cultural institutions, academies, foundations, associations, local authorities that operates in the field of cultural heritage;
* enterprises and companies rooted in the territory
* individuals that share the values of the LBT Manifesto and are willing to understand the cultural personality of a given territory
The portal is non-profit: the profits of memberships are reinvested into for cultural and development initiatives in the territory itself.
The supporters of Life Beyond Tourism promote a tourism of high cultural quality with a special focus on intercultural dialogue.

===Patronage and members===
Many organizations granted their patronage to Life Beyond Tourism. Among them: [[ICCROM]], [[ICOMOS]] Italia, the [[Council of Europe]], the Società Italiana per la Protezione dei Beni Culturali (CIPBC), the Borsa Mediterranea del Turismo Archeologico, the Associazione Città e Siti Italiani Patrimonio Mondiale [[UNESCO]]. Among the Italian local authorities: The Region of [[Tuscany]],  the Province of [[Florence]], the Municipality of Florence, many municipalities in Tuscany ([[Castelfiorentino]], [[Forte dei Marmi]], [[Montecatini Terme|Montecatini]], [[Reggello]], San Piero a Sieve, [[Scarperia]].

'''''Lucky Ducky''''' is a 1948 American [[animated cartoon]] from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It was directed by [[Tex Avery]], animated by Walt Clinton (here credited as Walter Clinton), Preston Blair, Louie Schmitt, and Grant Simmons, and musical direction by [[Scott Bradley (composer)|Scott Bradley]].

This short was originally in development as a ''[[George and Junior]]'' entry, but was ultimately produced with two random dog characters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Adamson|Adamson, Joe]], ''Tex Avery: King of Cartoons'', 1975, De Capo Press&lt;/ref&gt; This is the last MGM cartoon in [[black and white]], and this is the only gag in [[black and white]].

== Plot synopsis ==
The foreword of the cartoon tells:

''Dedicated''&lt;br /&gt;
''to those duck hunters''&lt;br /&gt;
''who leave at dawn''&lt;br /&gt;
''with loaded gun...''&lt;br /&gt;
''and come home late loaded...''

Many ducks are swimming and flying around a pond. They are also doing a [[conga line]] around two dogs who are hunting, waiting in their boat. Nearby at a tree, a sign reads "''No Hunting Before 6:AM''.  As the clock finally strikes six, all the ducks fly away before the two dogs have the chance to shoot one.  Then the dogs spot a mother duck having her nest with an egg in it strapped to herself.  The dogs miss the shot but the strap breaks, dropping the egg onto the boat and hatching.  Just then, it starts dancing and taking off the egg shell, and jumps into the water. The two dogs point their guns into the water, but no shooting is heard.  The dogs lift their guns, revealing that the duckling had tied the point of their guns together in a knot. The duckling laughs and jumps back into the water. The duckling goes under the boat and pulls out a drill, and puts a hole in the boat. The dogs notice the leaking, and the small dog covers the hole with his hands. Water starts coming out of his ears and the big dog covers the small dog's ears with his hands. Suddenly, water starts coming out of the big dog's ears, and the small dog stops the water by using the big dog's nose like a faucet. The small dog uncovers the hole, and the duckling honks his nose, laughs, and dives back in. The small dog points his gun into the hole, but the duckling snaps it shut with a clip. The small dog pulls up his gun, and the big dog lets go of the clip, and the gun explodes in the small dog's face. The duckling then lifts the boat and hits it against the water. The duckling laughs and swims away.

The small dog then heads to the motor, but the engine won't start. The big dog lifts the anchor and uses the small dog's head to start the boat.   As the dogs chase the duckling at super-sonic speed, the boat's rudder blades cut the water in half, then the land in half, sinking a tree.  Continuing the chase in the boat on dry land, the blades proceed to turn a log, two trees and a rock mountain into a bridge, staircase and ladder, and [[Mount Rushmore]], respectively.  The duckling and the boat go into a hole in a tree, and goes through another tree that has a hole. The duckling passes between two trees with the big tree suddenly lifting the small tree before the boat can do something to it.  After crossing a mudpit and squeezing between two other trees, the chase temporarily ends with the boat and everybody crashing into a rock and getting flattened.   Now chasing the duckling on foot, they stop upon a "Stop School Crossing" sign with an actual schoolhouse crossing the road.  Chasing the duckling into a forest, everything suddenly turns [[black and white]], the trio having passed a sign indicating "[[Technicolor]] Ends Here".  Going back into the color portion of the forest, the duckling stops at the edge of a cliff and spots the big dog coming towards him, prompting the duckling to pull out a bottle of "Quick Grow" and instantly turning a small plant into a tree which the big dog crashes into.  The big dog then grabs an ax, and then puts it down to spit on his hands. The little dog comes back, and the big dog blindly uses him instead of the ax.  The big dog notices this, and puts the little dog down. Then the little dog spits out a little pile of logs.

Back at the pond, the big dog is sniffing out the scent of the duckling who dumps pepper into the big dog's nose and places a pie in his hands.  The big dog's sneeze blows the pie out of his hands and all over the small dog, the whipped cream and cherry filling looking like an outfit of [[Santa Claus]].

The duckling jumps into a hole in a log. The big dog then reaches his hand into the log, but the duckling makes a slingshot, slinging the big dog's hand into his head. The big dog then points his gun towards the hole, but the duckling pulls out a frightening mask, shrinking the gun.  The big dog grabs the little dog's gun, but it doesn't shoot.  The big dog pulls out the bullet and hands it to the little dog.  The little dog gets shot in the face, leaving him in [[blackface]].  The little dog hands the big dog the bullet, and then the big dog gets left in blackface.

Next, the duckling leaves its footprints in the ground. The dogs' guns point to where the duckling is: in three different paths. The small dog then gets out a [[duck call]] and blows, but the duckling answers back with a smaller duck call.  The chase on water resumes by the dogs in their repaired boat.  The duckling suddenly stops and the dogs are about to shoot, but the duckling pulls out a STOP sign and points to the clock which now has a sign showing "NO SHOOTING AFTER 5:00 PM".  The whistle blows and the ducks come back, swimming, flying and doing another conga line.  Meanwhile, on the boat, the duckling has now joined the conga line as the camera irises out on him.

{{italictitle}}
'''''Ma'aseh Toviyyah''''' or '''''Ma'aseh Tobiyyah''''' ("Work of Tobias") was an encyclopedic scientific reference book written by [[Tobias Cohn]]. It was published in [[Venice, Italy]], in 1707, and reprinted there in 1715, 1728, 1769, and 1850. 

The work is divided into eight parts: (1) [[theology]]; (2) [[astronomy]]; (3) [[medicine]]; (4) [[hygiene]]; (5) [[syphilis|Syphilitic maladies]]; (6) [[botany]]; (7) [[cosmography]]; and (8) an essay on the [[Classical element|four elements]]. The most important is the third part, which contains an illustration showing a human body and a house side by side and comparing the members of the former to the parts of the latter (see illustration).

In part 2 are found an [[astrolabe]] and illustrations of astronomical and [[mathematical instruments]]. Inserted between parts 6 and 7 is [[Turkish language|Turkish]]-[[Latin]]-[[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[dictionary]]; and prefixed to the work is a poem by [[Solomon Conegliano]].

The '''Merseburg charms''' or '''Merseburg incantations''' ({{lang-de|die Merseburger Zaubersprüche}}) are two [[Middle Ages|medieval]] magic spells, charms or [[incantation]]s, written in [[Old High German]]. They are the only known examples of [[Germanic paganism|Germanic pagan belief]] preserved in the language. They were discovered in 1841 by [[Georg Waitz]],&lt;ref name=Jeep&gt;Jeep, John.  'Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia'.  Routledge; 2001.  pp.112-113. {{ISBN|0-8240-7644-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; who found them in a theological manuscript from [[Fulda]], written in the 9th or 10th century,&lt;ref name=Calvin&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Calvin |first=Thomas|title=An Anthology of German Literature|publisher=D. C. Heath &amp; co|oclc=6128632|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there remains some speculation about the date of the charms themselves. The manuscript (Cod. 136 f. 85a) is stored in the library of the [[cathedral chapter]] of [[Bishopric of Merseburg|Merseburg]], hence the name.

==History==
{{further|galdr}}
The Merseburg Incantations are the only known surviving instance of ostensibly pre-Christian, [[Germanic paganism|pagan]], [[Old High German literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Priest, George Madison|title=A Brief History of German Literature|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1909|page=11|asin=B0008AOAGC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Henry &amp; Weeks, Raymond, Editors,'Romanic Review Quarterly Journal, Volume VII, P.123. Columbia University Press, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

The incantations were recorded in the 10th century by a cleric, possibly in the abbey of [[Fulda]], on a blank page of a liturgical book, which later passed to the library at [[Merseburg]]. The incantations have thus been transmitted in [[Caroline minuscule]] on the flyleaf of a Latin [[sacramentary]].

The spells became famous in modern times through the appreciation of the [[Grimm brothers]], who wrote as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Lying between [[Leipzig]], [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Jena]], the extensive library of the Cathedral Chapter of Merseburg has often been visited and made use of by scholars. All have passed over a [[codex]] which, if they chanced to take it up, appeared to offer only well-known church items, but which now, valued according to its entire content, offers a treasure such that the most famous libraries have nothing to compare with it...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The spells were published later by the Brothers Grimm in ''On two newly-discovered poems from the German Heroic Period'' (1842).

The manuscript of the Merseburg Incantations was on display until November 2004 as part of the exhibition "Between Cathedral and World - 1000 years of the Chapter of Merseburg," at Merseburg cathedral. They were previously exhibited in 1939.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==The texts==
Each charm is divided into two parts: a preamble telling the story of a mythological event; and the actual spell in the form of a magic analogy (''just as it was before... so shall it also be now...''). In their verse form, the spells are of a transitional type; the lines show not only traditional [[alliteration]] but also the end-rhymes introduced in the [[Christian]] verse of the 9th century.

===First Merseburg Charm===
[[File:Idise by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|300px|"Idise" (1905) by [[Emil Doepler]].]]
The first spell is a "Lösesegen" (blessing of release), describing how a number of "[[Idisen]]"&lt;ref name=Calvin/&gt; freed from their shackles warriors caught during battle. The last two lines contain the magic words "Leap forth from the fetters, escape from the foes" that are intended to release the warriors.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Second Merseburg Charm===
[[File:Wodan Heilt Balders Pferd by Emil Doepler.jpg|300px|thumb|"Wodan Heals Balder's Horse" (1905) by Emil Doepler.]]
Phol  is with [[Woden|Wodan]]  when Baldur's horse dislocates its foot while riding through the forest (''holza''). Wodan intones the incantation: "Bone to bone, blood to blood, limb to limb, as if they were mended".

Figures that can be clearly identified within [[Continental Germanic mythology]] are "Uuôdan" ([[Wodan]]) and "Frîia" ([[Frija]]). Depictions found on [[Migration Period]] Germanic [[bracteates]] are often viewed as Wodan (Odin) healing a horse.&lt;ref name=LINDOW&gt;[[John Lindow|Lindow, John]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KlT7tv3eMSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs]'' (2001) Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-515382-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing [[Norse mythology]], Wodan is well-attested as the cognate of [[Odin]]. Frija the cognate of [[Frigg]],&lt;ref name=LINDOW/&gt; also identified with [[Freyja]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeep's translation gives "Freya". Benjamin Thorpe (Northern Mythology, 1851, p. 23) actually read the manuscript as having ''Frua'' rather than ''Friia'', ''Frua'' being the cognate of Norse [[Freyja]].&lt;/ref&gt;
''Balder'' is Norse [[Baldr]]. Phol is the masculine form of ''Uolla'', but the context makes clear that it is another name of Balder.&lt;ref name=Calvin/&gt;
''Uolla'' has been linked to [[Fulla]],  a minor goddess and a handmaid of Frigg.&lt;ref name=LINDOW/&gt; Sunna (the sun)  in Norse mythology is [[Sól (sun)|Sól]], though her sister [[Sinthgunt]] is otherwise unattested.&lt;ref name=BOSTOCK32&gt;Bostock, John Knight. (1976) ''A Handbook on Old High German Literature'', page 32. [[Oxford University Press]] {{ISBN|0-19-815392-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallels==
The First Merseburg Charm (loosening charm)'s similarity to the anecdote in [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Hist. Eccles.]]'',  IV, 22 ({{ws |"[[s:Ecclesiastical History of the English People/Book 4#12|"How a certain captive's chains fell off when masses were sung for him"]]'}}) has been noted by [[Jacob Grimm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Grimm|1884|loc=volume 3 (English)|p=1231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Christianized example, it is the singing of the mass, rather than the chanting of the charm, that effects the release of a comrade (in this case a brother). The unshackled man is asked "whether he had any spells about him, as are spoken of in fabulous stories",&lt;ref&gt;translation based on L.C. Jane (1903); A. M. Sellar (1907) (wikisource version)&lt;/ref&gt; which curiously has been translated as "loosening rune (about him)" ({{lang-oe|álýsendlícan rune}}) in the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] translation of Bede, as has been pointed out by [[Sophus Bugge]].  Bugge makes this reference in his edition of the [[Eddaic poems|Eddaic poem]] ''[[Grógaldr]]'' (1867), in an attempt to justify his emending the phrase "Leifnir's fire (?)" ({{lang-on|leifnis  elda}}) into  "loosening charm" ({{lang-on|leysigaldr}}) in the context of one of the magic charms that [[Gróa]] is teaching to her son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bugge|first=Sophus|title=Sæmundar Edda hins Fróda: Norroen Fornkvaedi|publisher=P. T. Mallings|year=1867|page=340|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VsAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA340}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this is an aggressive emendation of the original text, and its validity as well as any suggestion to its ties to the Merseburg charm is subject to skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Murdoch|first=Brian|title=But Did They Work? Interpreting the Old High German Merseburg Charms in their Medieval Context|journal=Neuphilologische Mitteilungen|volume=89|year=1988|pages=358–369|format=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AShZAAAAMAAJ}}, p.365, footnote. Quote: "The existence of the term "leysigaldr" in Old Norse is seductive, but does not constitute proof of the existence of these outside the realm of fiction, or that it can be applied to the Merseburg charm. "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;In the original text of ''Grógaldr'', the text that Bugge emended to ''leysigaldr'' actually reads ''leifnis eldr". This is discussed by Rydberg as "Leifner's or Leifin's fire", and connected by him to [[Dietrich von Bern]]'s fire-breath that can release the heroes from their chains ({{cite book|ref=harv|last=Rydobrg|first=Viktor|others=Rasmus Björn Anderson (translator|title=Teutonic mythology|volume=1|place=|publisher=S. Sonnenschein &amp; Co.|year=1907 |format=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqeLSMiYvD4C&amp;pg=PA61|page=61}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many analogous magic incantations to the Second Merseburg Charm (horse-healing spell), have been noted. Some paralleling is discernible in other Old German spells, but analogues are particularly abundant in [[folklore|folkloric]] spells from Scandinavian countries (often preserved in so-called "[[Cyprianus|black books]]".). Similar charms have been noted in Gaelic, Lettish and Finnish suggesting that the formula is of ancient Indo-European origin.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Some commentators trace the connection back to writings in [[#Ancient India|ancient India]].

===Other Old German spells===
Other spells recorded in Old High German or [[Old Saxon]]/Old Low German noted for similarity, such as the group of ''wurmsegen'' spells for casting out the "Nesso" worm causing the affliction.&lt;ref name=grimm-dm-ch38/&gt; There are several manuscript recensions of this spell, and [[Jacob Grimm]] scrutinizes in particular the so-called "Contra vermes" variant,&lt;ref name=braune-worms/&gt; in [[Old Saxon|Low German]]&lt;ref name=murdoch/&gt; from the [[codex|Cod.]] Vidob. theol. 259&lt;ref name=grimm-dm-ch38/&gt; (now [[Österreichische Nationalbibliothek|ÖNB]] Cod. 751&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last= Fath|first=Jacob|title=Wegweiser zur deutschen Litteraturgeschichte|place=|publisher=|year=1884|format=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DL1BAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA7|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The text is a mixture of Latin and German:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{space|5}}'''Contra vermes''' (against worms&lt;ref name=murdoch/&gt;)
&lt;poem&gt;
Gang ût, nesso, {{space|5}} mit nigun nessiklînon,
ût fana themo margę an that bên, {{space|5}} fan themo bêne an that flêsg,
ût fana themo flêsgke an thia hûd, {{space|5}} ût fan thera hûd an thesa strâla.
{{space|15}}Drohtin, uuerthe so!&lt;ref name=braune-worms&gt;{{Harv|Braune|1979|p=90}} (Repr. 1994) For additional ms. details, see Wikisource version:{{ws |"[[:de:s:Contra vermes]]"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Grimm explains, the spell tells the ''nesso'' worm and its nine young ones to begone, away from the marrow to bone, bone to flesh, flesh to [[wikt:hide|hide]] (skin), and into the ''strâla'' or arrow, which is the implement into which the pest or pathogen is to be coaxed.&lt;ref name=grimm-dm-ch38/&gt; It closes with the invocation: "Lord (''Drohtin''), let it be".&lt;ref name=murdoch&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Murdoch|first=Brian|title=German Literature of the Early Middle Ages|place=|publisher=Camden House|year=2004 |format=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqeLSMiYvD4C&amp;pg=PA61|page=61|isbn=9781571132406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grimm insists that this charm, like the ''De hoc quod Spurihalz dicunt'' charm ([[Middle High German|MHG]]: ''spurhalz''; {{lang-de|[[wikt:lahm|lahm]]}} "lame") that immediately precedes it in the manuscript, is "about lame horses again." And the "transitions from marrow to bone (or sinews), to flesh and hide, resemble phrases in the sprain-spells," i.e. the Merseburg horse-charm types.

===Scandinavia===

[[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''Deutsche Mythologie'', chapter 38, listed examples of what he saw as survivals of the Merseburg charm in popular traditions of his time: from Norway a prayer to Jesus for a horse's leg injury, and two spells from Sweden, one invoking Odin (for a horse suffering from a [[wikt:fit#Etymology 4|fit]] or [[Strangles|equine distemper]]&lt;ref name=thorpe023/&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Fortunately {{Harv|Thorpe|1851|loc=vol.1|pp=23–4}} provides an English translation side by side with the Swedish charm, and clarifies that the condition, in Swedish ''floget'' or the 'flog' is "horse distemper". Grimm says it corresponds to German: ''anflug'' or a "fit" in English, but it is hard to find any sources precisely defining this.&lt;/ref&gt;) and another invoking [[Frigg|Frygg]] for a sheep's ailment.&lt;ref name=grimm-dm-ch38/&gt; He also quoted one Dutch charm for fixing a horse's foot, and a Scottish one for the treatment of human sprains that was still practiced in his time in the 19th century (See [[#Scotland]] below).

====Norway====
Grimm provided in his appendix another Norwegian horse spell,&lt;ref name=grimm-dm-ch38/&gt; which has been translated and examined as a parallel by [[Benjamin Thorpe|Thorpe]].&lt;ref name=thorpe023/&gt; Grimm had recopied the spell from a tome by Hans Hammond, ''Nordiska Missions-historie'' (Copenhagen 1787), pp.&amp;nbsp;119–120, the spell being transcribed by [[Thomas von Westen]] c. 1714.&lt;ref name=bang&gt;{{Harv|Bang|1901–2|loc=chapter 1, Spell #4|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to be the same spell in English as given as a parallel by a modern commentator, though he apparently misattributes it to the 19th century.&lt;ref name="GRIFFITHS-174"/&gt; The texts and translations will be presented side-by-side below:

The number of Norwegian analogues is quite large, though many are just variations on the theme.  Bishop [[Anton Christian Bang]] compiled a volume culled from Norwegian [[Cyprianus|black books]] of charms and other sources, and classified the horse-mending spells under the opening chapter "Odin og Folebenet", strongly suggesting a relationship with the second Merseburg incantation.&lt;ref&gt;Bang's ''Norse hexeformulaer'' collection lacks commentary, but {{Harv|Bang|1884}} makes clear he subscribes to the parallelism view espoused by Grimm and Bugge.&lt;/ref&gt; Bang here gives a group of 34 spells, mostly recorded in the 18th–19th century though two are assigned to the 17th (c. 1668 and 1670),&lt;ref name=bang/&gt; and 31 of the charms&lt;ref name=fet/&gt; are for treating horses with an injured leg. The name for the horse's trauma, which occurs in the titles, is {{lang-no|vred}} in most of the rhymes, with smatterings of ''raina'' and ''bridge'' (''sic.''), but they all are essentially synonymous with ''brigde,'' glossed as the "dislocation of the limb" &lt;ref group="n"&gt;''brigde'' {{lang-da|Forvridning af Lemmer}} (dislocation of the limbs)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ivar Aasen|Aasen]]'s dictionary.&lt;ref name=fet&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Fet|first=Jostein|title=Magiske Fromlar frå Hornindalen|journal=Mal og Minne|volume=2|year=2010|format=|url=|pages=134–155}} ([http://web.novus.no/MOM/MOM_2010-2.pdf pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Aasen|first=Ivar Andreas|title=Ordbog over det norske folkesprog|publisher=Trykt hos C. C. Werner|year=1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=agRAAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Bishop Bang's collection, the following is a list of specific formulas discussed as parallels in scholarly literature:
* No. 2, "Jesus og St. Peter over Bjergene red.." (c. 1668. From [[Lister og Mandal Amt]], or the modern-day [[Vest-Agder]]. Ms. preserved at the Danish [[Rigsarkivet]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masser|1972|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No. 6, Jesus red sig tile Hede.." (c. 1714. [[Veøy|Veø]], [[Romsdal]]). Same as Grimm's LII quoted above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Grimm|1844}}, repr. {{Harv|Grimm|1865|loc=vol.2|pp=1–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="n"&gt;Grimm#LVII and Bang's no.4 have spelling differences, but both cite Hammond as source, and the identity is mentioned in {{Harv|Bang|1884|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No, 20, "Jeus rei sin Faale over en Bru.." (c. 1830. [[:en:Skåbu|Skåbu]], [[Oppland]]. However Wadstein's paper does not focus the study on the base text version, but the variant Ms. B which has the "Faale" spelling)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Wadstein|1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No. 22, "Vor Herre rei.." (c. 1847. [[Valle, Norway|Valle]], [[Sætersdal]]. Recorded by [[Jørgen Moe]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bang|1884|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;No. 7 and a text similar to No. 21 are used as parallels in the [[Norwegian Wikipedia]] article, [[:no:Merseburgerformelen]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Bang's Group 3 (#24~28), and Group 4(#29~34) are apparently modified texts--&gt;

It might be pointed out that none of the charms in Bang's chapter "Odin og Folebenet" actually invokes [[Odin]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;although a couple of charms (No. 40, No. 127) amongst some 1550 in Bang's volume do name the pagan god)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the charms have been Christianized and that the presence of [[Baldur]] has been substituted by "The Lord" or Jesus is expressed by Bang in another treatise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last= Bang|first=Anton Christia|author-link=Anton Christian Bang|title=Gjengangere fra hedenskabet og katholicismen blandt vort folk efter reformationen|place=Oslo|publisher=Mallingske|year=1884|format=|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=ja&amp;lr=&amp;id=Ec4VAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA167|pages=167-}}&lt;/ref&gt; crediting communications with [[Sophus Bugge|Bugge]] and the work of Grimm in the matter. Jacob Grimm had already pointed out the Christ-Balder identification in interpreting the Merseburg charm; Grimm seized on the idea that in the Norse language, "White Christ (''hvíta Kristr'')" was a common epithet, just as Balder was known as the "white [[Æsir]]-god" &lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Stanley|1975|p=78}}, citing Grimm's ''DM'' 1st ed., Anhang, p.cxlviii and, {{Harv|Grimm|1844}} p.21-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strikingly similar "horse cure" incantation is a 20th-century sample that hails the name of the ancient 11th-century Norwegian king [[Olaf II of Norway]]. The specimen was collected in [[Møre og Romsdal|Møre]], Norway, where it was presented as for use in healing a bone fracture:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Sweden====
Several Swedish analogues were given by [[Sophus Bugge]] and by [[Viktor Rydberg]] in writings published around the same time (1889). The following 17th-century spell was noted as a parallel to the Merseburg horse charm by both of them:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Rydberg|first=Viktor|title=Undersökningar i Germanisk Mythologi|volume=2|publisher=A. Bonnier|year=1889|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnMoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA238|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bugge-studier287&gt;''Studier over de nordiske Gude- and Helte-sagns Oprindelse'' {{Harv|Bugge|1889|loc=pp.287, 549- (addendum to p.284ff)}}; Germ. tr. by Brenner, {{Harv|Bugge|1889b|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also translated ''led vid led'' as "sinew to sinew", but Brenner has ''Glied'' (joint)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example (from Kungelf's Dombok, 1629) was originally printed by Arcadius:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Kock|first=Axel|title=Var Balder äfven en tysk gud ?|journal=Svenska landsmål och svenskt folkliv|volume=6|year=1887|pages=cl (xlvii-cl)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Kj7UJlnbFgC&amp;pg=PR150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rydberg239&gt;{{Harvnb|Rydberg|1889|loc=volume 2|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A spell beginning "S(anc)te Pär och wår Herre de wandrade på en wäg (from [[Sunnerbo]] hundred, [[Småland]] 1746) was given originally by [[Johan Nordlander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Nordlander|first=J.|title=Trollformler ock signerier (Smärre Meddelanden Nr. 2)|journal=Svenska landsmål och svenskt folkliv|volume=2|year=1883|page= xlvii|url=//books.google.com/books?id=5NMsAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very salient example, though contemporary to Bugge's time, is one that invokes Odin's name:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Ebermann|1903|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

A Danish parallel noted by [[Adalbert Kuhn|A.

===Scotland===
Grimm also exemplified a Scottish charm (for people, not horses) as a salient remnant of the Merseburg type of charm.&lt;ref name=grimm-dm-ch38/&gt; This healing spell for humans was practiced in the [[Shetlands]]&lt;ref name=chambers/&gt;&lt;ref name=StatAccScot/&gt; (which has strong Scandinavian ties and where the [[Norn language]] used to be spoken). The practice involved tying a "wresting thread" of black wool with nine knots around the sprained leg of a person, and in an inaudible voice pronouncing the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:The Lord rade and the foal slade; 
:he lighted and he righted,
:set joint to joint,  
:bone to bone, 
:and sinew to sinew

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Alexander Macbain]] (who also supplies a presumably reconstructed Gaelic "Chaidh Criosd a mach/Air maduinn mhoich" to the first couplet of "The Lord rade" charm above&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Macbain1892b|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;) also records a version of a horse spell which was chanted while "at the same time tying a worsted thread on the injured limb."&lt;ref name=macbain-gaelsp&gt;{{Harvnb|Macbain|1892a|p=119}}, {{Harvnb|Macbain|1892b|pp=223–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Christ went forth

Broken across.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Macbain goes on to quote another Gaelic horse spell, one beginning "Chaidh Brìde mach.." from ''[[Norman Macleod (Caraid nan Gaidheal)|Cuairtear nan Gleann]]'' (July, 1842) that invokes [[Brigit of Kildare|St. Bride]] as a "he" rather than "she", plus additional examples suffering from corrupted text.

===Ancient India===
There have been repeated suggestions that healing formula of the Second Merseburg Charm may well have deep Indo-European roots. A parallel has been drawn between this charm and an example in [[Vedic literature]], an incantation from the 2nd millennium BCE found in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', hymn IV, 12:&lt;ref name=kuhna-058&gt;{{Harvnb|Kuhn|1864|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Cebrián|first=Reyes Bertolín|title=Singing the Dead: A Model for Epic Evolution|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2006|pages=17–18|format=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cj_phoTY8oYC&amp;pg=PA17}}, quote: "..The parallels of the Merserburger Charm in Vedic literature..," is followed by the text of the ''Atharvaveda'' 4,12 and translation by {{Harv|Whitney|1905}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Wilhelm|first=Friedrich|title=The German Response to Indian Culture|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=81|number=4-2|year=1961|page=395|doi=10.2307/595685|jstor=595685}}, "one of the " Merseburger Zauberspruche " (Merseburg Spells) which has its parallel in the Atharvaveda"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Eichner|first=Heiner|title=Kurze indo-germanische Betrachtungen über die atharvavedische Parallele zum Zweiten Merseburger Zauberspruch (mit Neubehandlung von AVS.

[[File:Brazil-16-map.jpg|thumb|250px|"Terra Brasilis" by [[Pedro Reinel]] and [[Lopo Homem]], Miller Atlas, in the [[French National Library]] in Paris]]

The '''Miller Atlas''', also known as '''Lopo Homem-Reineis Atlas''', is a richly illustrated [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[atlas]] dated from 1519, including a dozen charts. It is a joint work of the cartographers [[Lopo Homem]], [[Pedro Reinel]] and [[Jorge Reinel]], and illustrated by miniaturist António de Holanda. 

The regions represented are the North Atlantic Ocean, Northern Europe, the Azores Archipelago, Madagascar, the Indian Ocean, Indonesia, China Sea, the Moluccas, Brazil and the Mediterranean Sea. It was acquired in 1897 for the [[National Library of France]] by the librarian Bénigne Emmanuel Clement Miller, hence the name Miller Atlas. 

It stands out for details of the map 'Terra Brasilis', less than twenty years after the landing of [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]. It is thought to have been an offering from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] to [[Francis I of France]]. The charts included and its authoring raised great controversy among scholars, particularly a world map closed to the Pacific Ocean, which has been interpreted as an attempt to dissuade the circumnavigation that [[Ferdinand Magellan]] then prepared in Seville, in the court of [[Charles I of Spain]].

Its title page bears a later inscription with the arms of [[Catherine de Medici]] with the text, ''"Hec est universi orbis ad hanc usqz diem cogniti / tabula quam ego Lupus homo Cosmographus / in clarissima Ulisipone civitate Anno domini nostri / Millessimo quigentessimo decimo nono jussu / Emanuelis incliti lusitanie Regis collatis pluribs / aliis tam vetustorum qz recentiorum tabulis mag / na industria et dilligenti labore depinxi."''&lt;ref name=BNF&gt;{{cite web|last=Bibliothèque nationale de France|first=Gallica|title=Atlas nautique du Monde, dit atlas Miller ; 2-5.

The '''Project Management Body of Knowledge'''  is a set of standard terminology and guidelines (a [[body of knowledge]]) for [[project management]]. The body of knowledge evolves over time and is presented in ''A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge'' (the ''Guide to the PMBOK'' or the Guide), a book whose sixth edition was released in 2017. The Guide is a document resulting from work overseen by the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI), which offers the [[Certified Associate in Project Management|CAPM]] and [[Project Management Professional|PMP]] certifications.

Much of ''the PMBOK Guide'' is unique to project management e.g. [[critical path method]] and [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS). ''The PMBOK Guide'' also overlaps with [[general management]] regarding planning, organising, staffing, executing and controlling the operations of an organisation. Other management disciplines which overlap with the PMBOK Guide include [[financial forecasting]], [[organisational behaviour]], [[management science]], [[budgeting]] and other planning methods.

==History==

Earlier versions of the ''PMBOK Guide'' were recognized as standards by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) which assigns standards in the United States (ANSI/PMI 99-001-2008) and the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE 1490-2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=6086683 |title=IEEE Guide--Adoption of the Project Management Institute (PMI(R)) Standard A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide)--Fourth Edition |author=IEEE |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of the ''PMBOK Guide'' is reflected in editions of the Guide.  The Guide was first published by the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) in 1996. That document was to some extent based on earlier work that began with a [[white paper]] published in 1983 called the "Ethics, Standards, and Accreditation Committee Final Report." The second edition was published in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, copyright page, edition 2 {{ISBN|1-880410-12-5}}, and edition 3 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-930699-45-8}}, and edition 4 2008 {{ISBN|1-933890-51-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the ''PMBOK Guide — Third Edition'' was published with major changes from the previous editions. The ''Fourth edition'' was published in 2008. The Fifth Edition'' was released in 2013.

The latest English-language version of ''The PMBOK Guide — The Sixth Edition was released in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/project-management-pmp/update] Project Management Institute], retrieved 11 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;''

== Purpose ==
''The PMBOK Guide'' is intended to be a "subset of the project management body of knowledge that is generally recognized as a good practice. 'Generally recognized' means the knowledge and practices described are applicable to most projects most of the time and there is a consensus about their value and usefulness. 'Good practice' means there is a general agreement that the application of the knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques can enhance the chance of success over many projects."&lt;ref name=PMBOK2012/&gt; This means that sometimes the "latest" project management trends, often promoted by consultants, may not be part of the latest version of ''The PMBOK Guide''.

However, the 6th Edition of the PMBOK Guide now includes an "Agile Practice Guide"

== Contents ==
''The PMBOK Guide'' is process-based, meaning it describes work as being accomplished by processes. This approach is consistent with other management standards such as [[ISO 9000]] and the [[Software Engineering Institute]]'s [[CMMI]]. Processes overlap and interact throughout a project or its various phases.

* Inputs (documents, plans, designs, etc.)
* Tools and Techniques (mechanisms applied to inputs)
* Outputs (documents, plans, designs, etc.)

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge — Sixth Edition provides guidelines for managing individual projects and defines project management related concepts. It also describes the project management life cycle and its related processes, as well as the project life cycle.&lt;ref name="PMBOK2012"&gt;Project Management Institute, '''A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge''' – Fifth Edition, Project Management Institute Inc., 2013, Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the first time it includes an "Agile Practice Guide".

The PMBOK as described in the Guide recognizes 49 processes that fall into five basic process groups and ten knowledge areas that are typical of most projects, most of the time.

=== Process groups ===
The five ''process groups'' are:
# '''Initiating''': processes performed to define a new project or a new phase of an existing project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase.
# '''Planning''': Those processes required to establish the scope of the project, refine the objectives, and define the course of action required to attain the objectives that the project was undertaken to achieve.
# '''Executing''': Those processes performed to complete the work defined in the project management plan to satisfy the project specifications
# '''Monitoring and Controlling''': Those processes required to track, review, and regulate the progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the plan are required; and initiate the corresponding changes.
# '''Closing''': Those processes performed to finalize all activities across all Process Groups to formally close the project or phase.

=== Knowledge areas ===
The ten ''knowledge areas'', each of which contains some or all of the project management processes, are:

# [[Project Integration Management]] : the processes and activities needed to identify, define, combine, unify, and coordinate the various processes and project management activities within the [[project management process groups]].
# Project [[Scope (project management)|Scope]] management : the processes required to ensure that the project includes all the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully.
# [[Project Schedule Management]] : the processes required to manage the timely completion of the project. Until the 6th edition of the PMBOK Guide this was called "Project Time Management"
# [[Project cost management|Project Cost Management]] : the processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding, managing, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved budget.
# Project [[Quality Management]] : the processes and activities of the performing organization that determine quality policies, objectives, and responsibilities so that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken.
# Project [[Resource Management]] : the processes that organize, manage, and lead the project team. Until the 6th edition of the PMBOK Guide this was called "Project Human Resource Management"
# Project [[Communications Management]] : the processes that are required to ensure timely and appropriate planning, collection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management, control, monitoring, and the ultimate disposition of project information.
# [[Project Risk Management]] : the processes of conducting risk management planning, identification, analysis, response planning, and controlling risk on a project.
# [[Project Procurement Management]] : the processes necessary to purchase or acquire products, services, or results needed from outside the project team.  Processes in this area include Procurement Planning, Solicitation Planning, Solicitation, Source Selection, Contract Administration, and Contract Closeout.
# Project [[Stakeholder management|Stakeholder Management]] : the processes required to identify all people or organizations impacted by the project, analyzing stakeholder expectations and impact on the project, and developing appropriate management strategies for effectively engaging stakeholders in project decisions and execution.

Each of the ten knowledge areas contains the processes that need to be accomplished within its discipline in order to achieve effective project management.  Each of these processes also falls into one of the five process groups, creating a matrix structure such that every process can be related to one knowledge area and one process group.

== Extensions ==
While the ''PMBOK Guide'' is meant to offer a general guide to manage most projects most of the time, there are currently three official extensions: 
* ''Software Extension to the PMBOK Guide'' 
* ''Construction Extension to the PMBOK Guide'' 
* ''Government Extension to the PMBOK Guide''

==Criticism and alternatives==
The PMBOK is a widely accepted standard in project management, however there are alternatives to the PMBOK standard, and PMBOK does have its critics.  One thrust of critique has come from the [[critical chain]] developers and followers (e.g. [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] and [[Lawrence P. Leach]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] . {{ISBN|0884271536}} and Lawrence P. Leach. (Artech House Professional Development Library). {{ISBN|1580530745}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to [[critical path method]] adherents. The PMBOK Guide section on Project Time Management does indicate Critical Chain as an alternative method to Critical Path. 

A second strand of criticism originates in [[Lean Construction]]. This approach emphasises the lack of two way communication in the PMBOK model and offers an alternative which emphasises a [[language/action perspective]] and [[continual improvement]] in the planning process.&lt;ref&gt;Koskela, L. &amp; Howell, G. (2002) 'The underlying theory of project management is obsolete', Proceedings of the PMI Research Conference 2002, 293-302. [https://usir.salford.ac.uk/9400/1/2002_The_underlying_theory_of_project_management_is_obsolete.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''retention schedule''' is a listing of organizational information types, or series of information in a manner which facilitates the understanding and application of the identified and approved [[retention period]], and other information retention aspects.

==Purpose==
Retention schedules are an important aspect of [[records management]]. Many organizations are subject to rules and regulations (at the local, state or federal level) that govern for how long they are required to keep records before they can safely dispose of them. Holding onto records for longer than required can expose the organization to unnecessary liability, since such records are [[electronic discovery|discoverable]] during lawsuits.

==Basic information==
*  Record/series title (name)
*  Description of information within record/series
*  Approved retention period
*  Appropriate security requirements
*  Appropriate destruction method

==Further items for schedule consideration==
*  Location of retention
*  Date record type/series approved
*  Responsible group/office/person(s) of record
*  Remarks related to record/series
*  Series number applied to a specific record/series

==See also==
* [[Records management]]
* [[Information governance]]

'''''Road to Rio''''' is a 1947 American semi-[[musical film|musical]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Norman Z. McLeod]] and starring [[Bing Crosby]], [[Bob Hope]], and [[Dorothy Lamour]].&lt;ref name="IMDb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Road to Rio |publisher=''Internet Movie Database'' |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039776/ |accessdate=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written by Edmund Beloin and [[Jack Rose (screenwriter)|Jack Rose]], the film is about two inept [[vaudevillians]] who stow away on a [[Brazil|Brazilian]]-bound ocean liner and foil a plot by a sinister [[hypnotist]] to marry off her niece to a greedy fortune hunter. ''Road to Rio'' was the fifth of the "''[[Road to …]]''" series.

==Plot==
Scat Sweeney and Hot Lips Barton, two out-of-work musicians, travel the United States trying to find work and stay away from girls.  After running from state to state, each time running because of a girl, they try their luck in [[Louisiana]].

They stow away on board a [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]]-bound ship, after accidentally starting some fires at a circus. They then get mixed up with the distraught Lucia, who first thanks them, then unexpectedly turns them over to the ship's captain. Unbeknownst to both of them, Lucia is being hypnotized by her crooked guardian, Catherine Vail.  Vail plans to marry Lucia to her brother so she can control her and a set of "papers."

After a series of misadventures, including sneaking off the boat, recruiting a few local musicians, and the boys trying to escape with Lucia only to have Vail hypnotize her again and slap them both, Vail decides to do away with the boys permanently.  She hypnotizes both of them and tries to get them to kill each other in a [[duel]], but it fails.  Scat and Hot Lips finally figure things out and the boys head for the ceremony in order to stop the wedding and to help catch the crooks. Upon finding the "papers", which Scat reads, when Hot Lips asks what they are about, Scat tears them up and looks into the camera, saying, "The world must ''never'' know."

Later on, Scat is dismayed to see that Lucia loves Hot Lips and not him, but upon peeking through a keyhole, he sees Hot Lips hypnotizing her.

Hope's frequent sidekick [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]] has a cameo as the leader of a cavalry charging to the rescue of Bing and Bob, as the film cuts away to the galloping horses periodically. All is resolved before he can arrive, leading Colonna to point out:

==Production and reception==
Filmed from January to March 1947, the film was financed by Bing, Bob Hope, and Paramount. It produced $4.5 million in rental income in its initial release period in the United States and was placed sixth in the top-grossing films of 1947.  The critics liked it, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' saying in its review of February 19, 1948, inter alia: "With Bing Crosby and Bob Hope on the tramp again in “Road to Rio,” recklessly scattering jokes and rescuing perennial girl friend Dorothy Lamour from dangerous hypnotic trances, there’s fun to be had at the Paramount. Maybe this is not the funniest picture ever made; maybe it is not even quite as rewarding as some of those earlier journeys, but there are patches in this crazy quilt that are as good and, perhaps, even better than anything the boys have done before. They are traversing more of a rollercoaster highway than usual this time and so there are some tedious uphill pulls when the huffing and puffing is excessive and the results negligible. However, when they reach the top “Road to Rio” is irresistible... All that matters really is that “Road to Rio” is fairly well loaded with laughs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B04E4DF1F38E33BBC4152DFB4668383659EDE|website=The New York Times|accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewed it at a [[tradeshow]] and liked it too. "This celluloid [[Film promotion|junket]] along the Road to Rio should find smooth riding to sturdy [[box-office]]. The pattern established by other Paramount “Road” pictures is solidly followed by Daniel Dare’s production to keep the laughs spilling and the paying customers satisfied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Variety|date=November 12, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
[[File:A-629 Road to Rio.jpg|thumb|''Road to Rio'' (Decca Records 1948)]]
*"Apalachicola, Fla" ([[Jimmy Van Heusen]] / [[Johnny Burke (lyricist)|Johnny Burke]]) including a few lines from [[Old Folks at Home|Swanee River]] and [[Carry Me Back to Old Virginny]], sung by Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.

*"Batuque No Morro" (Russo do Pandeiro / Sá Róris): sung by chorus, with parody lines by Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.

Another song "For What?" by Burke and Van Heusen was written for the film but dropped from the released print.

Bing Crosby recorded four of the songs for [[Decca Records]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Bing Crosby Discography|url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/crosby1bDecca.html|website=A Bing Crosby Discography|accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these were also issued on a 78 rpm album titled "[[Selections from Road to Rio]]". “But Beautiful” and "You Don't Have to Know the Language" made fleeting appearances in the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitburn|first1=Joel|title=Pop Memories 1890-1954|date=1986|publisher=Record Research Inc|location=Wisconsin, USA|isbn=0-89820-083-0|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby's songs were also included in the [[Bing's Hollywood vols.1-15#But Beautiful|Bing's Hollywood]] series.

==Copyright==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:RoadToRio 1947.jpg|thumb|Lobby card]]
The film's [[copyright]] was renewed in a timely manner by an associate of the film's owner. Originally registered for copyright as LP1171 with a declared publication date of August 25, 1947, the continuation of copyright was contingent upon renewal between the 27th and 28th anniversaries of that date. Renewal occurred July 25, 1975, number R610335. The film opened February 19, 1948, so the renewal is still timely even if that later date were considered publication date.

The copyright is now scheduled to run until 95 years after the publication date (2042). The renewal form names as authors Hope Enterprises and Bing Crosby Enterprises, which were partners when the film was produced. As it turned out, the copyright (which never expired, and thus the film never entered the public domain) was reassigned to [[Columbia Pictures Television]] (CPT) — Columbia and [[LBS Communications]] (which formed the joint venture [[Colex Enterprises]]) assumed the rights to this film from Hope Enterprises, and re-released the film to television in the 1980s.

Today, CPT and what is now [[FremantleMedia]] hold ancillary rights, with FremantleMedia holding the video license. Any DVD release from a company not licensed by FremantleMedia violates the copyright, which continues to credit CPT as the copyright holder, as evidenced by recent video releases by [[BCI Eclipse]], and now, as of the present, [[Shout! Factory]] (under Fremantle's license).

The film was preserved by the [[UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6018">The '''Roupell case''' (1862) was a notorious English legal dispute that centred on legal documents alleged to have been [[forgery|forged]] by [[William Roupell]] and excited great public interest.

==Background==
William Roupell was the [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] son of Richard Palmer Roupell who possessed extensive properties in London and the [[Home Counties]]. By 1853, William, who spent unwisely seeking to establish himself in fashionable society, was already in debt and launched a sequence of deceptions and forgeries, dishonestly to obtain much of his father's property. In particular, he forged a [[deed]] conveying Norbiton Estate to himself and then sold it to Mr Waite. Further, he destroyed his father's [[will (law)|will]], which had left much of his property to William's brother Richard, and forged a will leaving it to William's mother, with himself as [[executor]].&lt;ref name="harrisA"&gt;Harris (2001) ''pp''36-40&lt;/ref&gt; His father died in 1856 and in 1857 William was elected [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Lambeth (UK Parliament constituency)|Lambeth]].&lt;ref name="harrisB"&gt;Harris (2001) ''p.''41&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1862, William was no longer able to service the [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]] that he had taken out on the misappropriated property and on 30 March destroyed some of his papers and fled to Spain. In August, his brother Richard visited him in Spain and William returned to England. He was recognised and arrested for [[fraud]] and forgery.&lt;ref name="harrisC"&gt;Harris (2001) ''pp''61-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard sued Waite for possession of Norbiton Estate, contending that he would have inherited it under his father's valid, but destroyed, will. The trial began at [[Guildford]] on 18 August 1862.&lt;ref name="harrisD"&gt;Harris (2001) ''p.''63&lt;/ref&gt;

Shee opened Richard's case by presenting the background of the Roupell family property, William's financial difficulties and the alleged facts of the frauds and forgeries. Shee argued that the will must be a forgery as, purporting to be witnessed by William, William could not have been present to witness its execution on the said date. Shee called William who admitted the frauds and forgeries and his own [[perjury]] in the grant of [[probate]] of his father's estate. It was to have been Waite's defence that William was colluding with his brother Richard, possibly in return for some compensation, but the defence was never heard as the case settled, dividing the value of the estate between Waite and Richard Roupell.&lt;ref name="harrisE"&gt;Harris (2001) ''pp''64-76&lt;/ref&gt;

==''R v. Roupell (William)''==
On 24 September 1862, William appeared at the [[Old Bailey]] and pleaded guilty to the forgery. The judge, Mr Justice Byles, emphasising the seriousness of the offences, sentenced William to [[life imprisonment|penal servitude for life]].&lt;ref name="harrisF"&gt;Harris (2001) ''pp''81-85&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Roupell (Richard) v. Hays''==
In 1863, Richard again attempted to regain property in Great Warley, Essex by proving that mortgages on the property were invalid, having been obtained through forgery. William, still in custody but not in prison dress, again gave evidence of his own wrongdoing and various witnesses attested to Richard Palmer's careful business habits and his handwriting and signature.  [[forensic document examination|Forensic document examiner]] [[Charles Chabot]] gave [[expert witness|expert evidence]] that the signature was not Richard Palmer's.

The judge, [[William Channell|Mr Baron Channell]], warned the jury as to the unreliability of William's testimony and put to them four questions:
#Was the deed of gift in question signed by Richard Palmer in the presence of two witnesses?
#If not, did Richard Palmer, sign and seal the deed, despite the absence of witnesses?
#Was the will bequeathing property to Richard Palmer's wife genuine?
#If not, was Richard the rightful heir?

The [[jury]]&lt;ref&gt;Civil trials in the UK took place with a jury as finders of fact until the 1930s.&lt;/ref&gt; retired, ''[[The Times]]'' observing that they jury had a pile of shorthand notes about a foot in height that would overwhelm them and that the jury would probably be confused anyway. The jury returned after three hours, finding that the deed had not been signed in the presence of witnesses but unable to agree whether Richard Palmer had signed the deed at all. Further, the jury agreed that the will was a forgery but were unable to agree on the proof of Richard's rightful inheritance. Even after several hours' further deliberation, the jury were unable to agree.&lt;ref name="harrisG"&gt;Harris (2001) ''pp''87-100&lt;/ref&gt;

Though a retrial was mooted, the issue ultimately settled out of court. William was released on [[parole]] in September 1876. Richard spent the rest of his life attempting, largely unsuccessfully, to recover some of his lost fortune&lt;ref name="harris101"&gt;Harris (2001) ''p.''101&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Science Museum Group''' ('''SMG''')&lt;ref name=SMGabout /&gt; is a collection of British museums, comprising:

* The [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] in [[South Kensington]], London
* The [[Science and Industry Museum]] in [[Manchester]]
* The [[National Railway Museum]] in [[York]]
* The [[National Railway Museum Shildon]] in [[County Durham]] ("Locomotion")
* The [[National Science and Media Museum]] (formerly the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television) in [[Bradford]], and
* The [[Science Museum at Wroughton]] in [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]].

The chairman of the group is [[Dame Mary Archer]] who was appointed by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] for the four-year term from 2015 from 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prime Minister appoints Dame Mary Archer as new Chairman of the Science Museum Group|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-appoints-dame-mary-archer-as-new-chairman-of-the-science-museum-group|publisher=British Government|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dame Mary Archer was reappointed as Chairman 2019–2022 in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prime Minister Reappoints Chairman to the Board of the Science Museum Group|url=https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about-us/press-office/prime-minister-reappoints-chairman-board-science-museum-group|publisher=Science Museum Group|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "National Museum of Science and Industry" had been in use as the Science Museum's subtitle since the early 1920s. The Board of Trustees of the Science Museum is the corporate body of SMG and was established under the [[National Heritage Act]] (1983) for the purpose of general management of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SMG Board of Trustees|url=https://group.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about-us/board-of-trustees/ |publisher=Science Museum Group|accessdate=14-09-2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1 April 2012 the group was known as the '''National Museum of Science and Industry''' ('''NMSI''').&lt;ref name=AR2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ONS /&gt;

The [[National Railway Museum]] was established as a result of the transfer of the British Transport Commission’s railway collection to the Board of Trustees of the Science Museum. The [[National Science and Media Museum]], formerly the National Media Museum, was established by the Science Museum in 1983. The Science Museum was run directly by [[UK government|HM Government]] until 1984, when the Board of Trustees was established and NMSI was then adopted as a corporate title for the entire organisation.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/nmsipages/nmsiaccounts08-09.asp National Museum of Science and Industry: Annual Report and Accounts 2008–09]'', NMSI, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point NMSI no longer operated as part of a central government department; instead, it now had the status of a [[non-departmental public body]], operating within the public sector but separately from its associated sponsoring government department, the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]. The Science Museum Group operates as a charity; it also has a wholly owned subsidiary trading company, ''NMSI Trading Limited'', which was established in 1988.

From January 2012 the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester)|Science and Industry Museum]] in Manchester became part of the Science Museum Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Manchester's MOSI and London's Science Museum to merge |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-16010873 |work=BBC News |date=2 December 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Manchester's Museum of Science and Industry to become part of national Science Museum |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1466860_manchesters-museum-of-science-and-industry-to-become-part-of-national-science-museum |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2017 Locomotion, The National Railway Museum at Shildon, became part of the Science Museum Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=National Railway Museum Shildon Set to transfer to Science Museum Group |url=https://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/20092017-national-railway-museum-shildon-set-to-transfer-to-science-museum-group |journal=Museums Association |date=20-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were concerns that some of the Science Museum Group's museums would close under the 2013 Spending Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/02062013-vaizey-calls-for-bis-to-help-fund-smg|title=Vaizey calls for BIS to help fund Science Museum Group – Museums Association|author=|date=|website=www.museumsassociation.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26564">'''Social network analysis software''' ('''SNA software''') is [[software]] which facilitates [[quantitative analysis of behavior|quantitative]] or [[qualitative research|qualitative analysis]] of [[social network]]s, by describing features of a network either through numerical or [[Graph drawing|visual representation]].

==Overview==
Networks can consist of anything from families,&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Padgett, "Robust Action and the Rise of the Medici, 1400–1434" [[American Journal of Sociology]], 1993 [http://stevereads.com/papers_to_read/Robust%20Action%20and%20the%20Rise%20of%20the%20Medici,%201400-1434.pdf]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[project team]]s, [[classroom]]s, [[sports team]]s, [[legislature]]s, [[Nation states|nation-states]], [[disease vector]]s, membership on [[Social networking service|networking websites]] like Twitter or Facebook, or even the Internet.  Networks can consist of direct linkages between nodes or indirect linkages based upon shared attributes, shared attendance at events, or common affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman &amp; Faust, Social Network Analysis Methods and Applications&lt;/ref&gt;  Network features can be at the level of individual [[node (graph theory)|node]]s, [[dyad (sociology)|dyad]]s, [[triad (relationship)|triad]]s, ties and/or edges, or the entire network.  For example, node-level features can include network phenomena such as [[betweenness centrality|betweenness]] and [[centrality]], or individual attributes such as age, sex, or income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Hanneman |url=http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/ |title=Introduction to Social Network Methods: Table of Contents |publisher=Faculty.ucr.edu |date=1998-10-20 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SNA software generates these features from raw network data formatted in an edgelist, adjacency list, or [[adjacency matrix]] (also called sociomatrix), often combined with (individual/node-level) attribute data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/C1_Social_Network_Data.html |title=Introduction to Social Network Methods: Chapter 1: Social Network Data |publisher=Faculty.ucr.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the majority of network analysis software uses a plain text ASCII data format, some software packages contain the capability to utilize relational databases to import and/or store network features.

== Features ==
Visual representations of social networks are important to understand network data and convey the result of the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume1/Freeman.html|title=JoSS: Journal of Social Structure|date=|publisher=Cmu.edu|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Visualization often also facilitates qualitative interpretation of network data.   With respect to visualization, network analysis tools are used to change the layout, colors, size and other properties of the network representation.

Some SNA software can perform [[predictive analytics|predictive analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Only connect: Felix Grant looks at the application of data analysis software to social networks", ''Scientific Computing World'' June 2010: pp 9–10.[http://www.scientific-computing.com/features/feature.php?feature_id=277]&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes using network phenomena such as a tie to predict individual level outcomes (often called peer influence or contagion modeling), using individual-level phenomena to predict network outcomes such as the formation of a tie/edge (often called homophily models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.analytictech.com/mgt780/topics/homophily.htm |title=Homophily |publisher=Analytictech.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or particular type of triad, or using network phenomena to predict other network phenomena, such as using a triad formation at time 0 to predict tie formation at time 1.

== Types of Software ==
Network analysis software generally consists of either packages based on [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs), or packages built for scripting/programming languages.

=== GUI Packages ===
In general, the GUI packages are easier to learn, while scripting tools are more powerful and extensible.  Widely used, often open-sourced and well-documented GUI packages include [https://github.com/qualintitative/egoweb EgoWeb 2.0] (open source), [[NetMiner]], [http://www.analytictech.com/archive/ucinet.htm UCINet], [http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/ Pajek] (freeware), GUESS, ORA, [[Cytoscape]], [[Gephi]], [http://nodexlgraphgallery.org NodeXL], [http://socnetv.org Social Network Visualizer] (SocNetV, free software), [[Meerkat (SNA)]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amii.ca/projects/#/meerkat/ Projects - Amii - Meerkat]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[muxViz]] (open source).

Private GUI packages directed at business customers include: [https://arcadeanalytics.com Arcade Analytics], Idiro SNA Plus, [http://www.Keyhubs.com Keyhubs], KeyLines, KXEN, [https://web.archive.org/web/20171008191531/https://www.keynetiq.com/ Keynetiq], Linkurious, [http://www.mynetworkmap.com MyNetworkmap],  [http://www.organalytix.com OrgAnalytix], Orgnet, and [http://www.Polinode.com Polinode].

=== Scripting/Programming Tools ===
Commonly used and well-documented scripting tools used for network analysis include: [[NetMiner]] with Python scripting engine, the statnet suite of packages for the [[R (programming language)|R statistical programming language]], [[igraph]], which has packages for R and Python, [[muxViz]] (based on [[R (programming language)|R statistical programming language]] and [[GNU Octave]]) for the analysis and the visualization of multilayer networks,&lt;ref&gt;"MuxViz: a tool for multilayer analysis and visualization of networks", Journal of Complex Networks Vol. 3, 159.[http://comnet.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/10/12/comnet.cnu038.abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[NetworkX]] library for Python, and the SNAP package for large-scale network analysis in C++ and Python.  Though difficult to learn, some of these open source packages are growing much faster in terms of functionality and features than privately maintained software, and extensive documentation and tutorials are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sna.stanford.edu/rlabs.php |title=Social Network Analysis in R |publisher=Sna.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the tools above contain visualization capabilities.

The '''Staatsarchiv Ludwigsburg''' ('''Ludwigsburg State Archives'''), located in [[Ludwigsburg, Germany]], is a public [[institutional repository]] for roughly 680 state authorities within the [[Stuttgart (region)|District of Stuttgart]], Germany.&lt;ref name="Wright 2004" /&gt;

== Holdings ==
The historical holdings come from the [[North Württemberg]] [[:de:Regierungsbezirk Nordwürttemberg|(de)]] area.  Notable holdings, unveiled through the process of [[denazification]], include documents related to the [[holocaust]] (more than 500,000).

The archives also house the files of the [[Police Headquarters Stuttgart]] [[:de:Polizeipräsidium Stuttgart|(de)]], the decorative folders and role books of the [[Staatstheater Stuttgart]] and all birth records of the Landesfrauenklinik Stuttgart (Stuttgart Women's State Hospital); the documents of the [[Teutonic Order]], official books of the convent [[Ellwangen]] and documents of [[Ulm]], [[Esslingen am Neckar]], [[Heilbronn]], and other former [[Free imperial city|free imperial cities]].  The collections also include personnel files of the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] (the German National Railway) and the [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] (the German Federal Railway) from the [[Reichsbahndirektion/Bundesbahndirektion Stuttgart]] [[:de:Reichsbahndirektion Stuttgart|(de)]] (Federal Railway Directorate).

== Facilities ==
The Ludwigsburg State Archives relocated, in 1995, from a castle to the Arsenal Barracks and Armory located in the center of [[Ludwigsburg]].
# The Arsenal Barracks (Arsenalkaserne) houses the public areas – including a reading room, an auditorium, an exhibition room, library, and an administration office
# The Armory (Zeughaus) houses the [[Library stack|stacks]], which comprise more than {{convert|40,000|m|ft}} of archives
Both buildings were mechanically and structurally re-purposed to meet the safekeeping requirements of modern archives.  The buildings are connected by an underground corridor, through which a transport system delivers documents to researchers in the reading room.

== Governmental oversight ==

As part of the [[Baden-Württemberg]] administrative reorganization of 2005, Staatsarchiv Ludwigsburg has been a department of the newly created [[Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg]] [[:de:Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg|(de)]] (Baden-Württemberg State Archives), which was inaugurated January 1, 2005. Staatsarchiv Ludwigsburg is one of eight constituent departments of [[Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg]] [[:de:Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg|(de)]].  Six of the eight departments have an archival mission and two have a service mission.

Archive departments:
: Department 1: [[Staatsarchiv Freiburg]] [[:de:Staatsarchiv Freiburg (Deutschland)|(de)]]
: Department 2: [[Generallandesarchiv Karlsruhe]] [[:de:Generallandesarchiv Karlsruhe|(de)]]
: Department 3: Staatsarchiv Ludwigsburg with the branch, [[Hohenlohe-Zentralarchiv Neuenstein]] [[:de:Hohenlohe-Zentralarchiv Neuenstein|(de)]]
: Department 4: [[Staatsarchiv Sigmaringen]] [[:de:Staatsarchiv Sigmaringen|(de)]]
: Department 5: [[Hauptstaatsarchiv Stuttgart]] [[:de:Hauptstaatsarchiv Stuttgart|(de)]]

Service departments

[[File:Sunday-Times-Fast-Track-100-Logo.jpg|frame|right|Sunday Times Fast Track 100 Logo]]

The '''Sunday Times Fast Track 100''' is a list published annually in December in partnership with [[The Sunday Times]] newspaper in the UK. It ranks Britain's fastest growing privately held companies by sales growth over the last 3 years. The list is produced by Fast Track, an Oxford based research company, and sponsored by the [[Virgin Group]].

The seventeenth Sunday Times Virgin Fast Track 100 was published on 8 December 2013.

== Limitations ==
The Fast Track 100 is generally promoted as the definitive guide to the fastest growing privately held companies in the UK. [[Richard Branson]] is quoted as saying ''"Fast Track has become the definitive barometer of growth companies"'' However a number of limitations exists which mean that the list may not contain information on many fast growing companies.  Most important of these is the reliance on historical data.  Because Fast Track only deals in publicly available information generally from published accounts, the league table refers to data that is sometimes as much as 10 months out of date.

On the other hand, this method ensures objectivity and has led to the early identification of a number of household names, including [[Carphone Warehouse]], [[British Home Stores]] and [[Travelex]].

== Entry criteria ==
For entry to the 2013 Fast Track 100 companies were required to be:

* Unquoted
* Registered in the UK
* Non-subsidiary, independent
* 10 or more employees
* Annualised sales of at least £250,000 in 2009/10
* Annualised sales of at least £5m in 2012/13
* An increase in sales from penultimate to latest year, and a forecast of further sales growth
* Not a technology company

== Other Fast Track lists ==
Fast Track 100 is one of 7 business lists of private companies produced by Fast Track and published in the Sunday Times:
* Fast Track 100 - Fastest growth in sales
* [[Tech Track 100]] - Fastest growth in sales for 'tech' companies
* International Track 200 - Fastest growth in overseas sales
* [[Profit Track 100]] - Fastest growth in profits
* [[Buyout Track 100]] - Fastest growth in private equity-backed companies
* [[Top Track 100]]- Biggest private companies based on sales
* [[Top Track 250]] - Leading mid-market private companies

'''Tower Gateway''' is a [[Docklands Light Railway]] (DLR) station in the [[City of London]] and is located near the [[Tower of London]] and [[Tower Bridge]]. It adjoins the tracks to [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street station]] and is located on the site of a former station called [[Minories railway station|Minories]]. Tower Gateway is within [[List of stations in London fare zone 1|London fare zone 1]].

It is a short walk from both [[Tower Hill tube station|Tower Hill Underground station]] and Fenchurch Street. Access at street level from the [[Minories]] is via escalator, stairs or lift at the western end of the station. A pedestrian crossing connects the station with Tower Hill station, its closest London Underground connection. A narrow secondary staircase entrance at the eastern end of the platform, improved considerably in the early 2000s, descends to [[Mansell Street]]. It serves the eastern edge of the City of London financial district and development around [[St Katharine Docks]].

==History==
It was opened in 1987 as the western terminus of the initial DLR system and the station closest to central London.

The underground extension to [[Bank–Monument station|Bank]], which opened in 1991, diverges from the original route between Tower Gateway and [[Shadwell DLR station|Shadwell]], the next station to the east. It dives down a steep ramp not far from the eastern end of the platforms, from which it is clearly visible. Tower Gateway is the terminus for the less busy service to [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]]. Journeys to other branches of the DLR normally require a change.

In keeping with the DLR's original basic lightweight philosophy, Tower Gateway is a simple elevated terminus.  As built it had two tracks and a cross-over. When the extension to Bank opened, its importance was substantially reduced. Before reconstruction it had a fairly narrow central platform, and a single track leading from the main route to a set of points immediately prior to the platforms.

Further major alterations began on 30 June 2008. The station reopened on 2 March 2009, rebuilt as a single-track terminus to enable three-car trains with a platform on each side of the train, one for arriving passengers and the other for departures (the [[Spanish solution]]).

==Future==
A Transport Supporting Paper released by the office of the Mayor of London envisages the closure of Tower Gateway DLR station and the branch serving it, with a replacement interchange being provided via new platforms at Tower Hill station. The reasoning is given that currently, 90 per cent of DLR City passengers use Bank station, but only 75 per cent of services go there; this would increase service to Bank from 23tph to 30tph, thereby unlocking more capacity on the Bank branch.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections==
[[London Buses]] services serves the station, key routes [[London Buses route 42|42]] and [[London Buses route 78|78]], local routes [[London Buses route 100|100]] and [[London Buses route RV1|RV1]] and night route [[London Buses route N551|N551]] serve the station.&lt;ref&gt;https://tfl.gov.uk/bus/stop/HUBTOG/tower-gateway&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Trictionary''''' (1982) is a 400-page trilingual English/Spanish/Chinese translation wordbook. It covers about 3,000 words in each language. The book was compiled by anonymous volunteers, mostly younger students from New York City whose native language was English, Spanish or Chinese. The compilation was done, as ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reports (10 May 1982) "by the spare-time energy of some 150 young people from the neighborhood" aged between 10 and 15, two afternoons a week over three years.&lt;ref name=ny&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1982/05/10/1982_05_10_031_TNY_CARDS_000335067 |title=The Talk of the Town: "Triple Play" |work=[[The New Yorker]] |author=Alastair Reid |date=May 10, 1982 |page=31 |accessdate=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was sponsored by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and work was done at the [[Chatham Square]] branch of the [[New York Public Library]]. The original idea was developed by Jane Shapiro, a teacher of English as a Second Language at Junior High School 65, helped by Mary Scherbatoskoy of ARTS (Art Resources for Teachers and Students).

[[Tom McArthur (author)|Tom McArthur]], in his 1986 book ''Worlds of Reference'',&lt;ref name=mcarthur&gt;{{cite book |title=Worlds of Reference: lexicography, learning and language from the clay tablet to the computer |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |author=[[Tom McArthur (linguist)|Tom McArthur]] |year=1986 |pages=181-183 |isbn=978-0-521-31403-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; thought of the project as a future model for reference work creation: group collaboration, volunteer work and no single or named author. "I am considering something much more radically interesting: turning students on occasion into once-in-a-lifetime [[Samuel Johnson]]s and [[Noah Webster]]s." &lt;ref name=mcarthur/&gt; McArthur's observation was prescient, the project is now seen as an early model of [[social information processing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2009/02/wikipedia_before_wikipedia.html |title=Wikipedia before Wikipedia |work=if:book |publisher=The Institute of the Book |author=Dan Visel |date=February 12, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216154124/http://futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2009/02/wikipedia_before_wikipedia.html |archivedate=2009-02-16 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trust on first use''' ('''TOFU'''), or '''trust upon first use''' ('''TUFU'''), is a [[computer security model|security model]] used by client software which needs to establish a trust relationship with an unknown or not-yet-trusted endpoint. In a TOFU model, the client will try to look up the identifier, usually some kind of [[Public-key cryptography|public key]], in its local trust database. If no identifier exists yet for the endpoint, the client software will either prompt the user to determine if the client should trust the identifier or it will simply trust the identifier which was given and record the trust relationship into its trust database. If a different identifier is received in subsequent connections to the endpoint the client software will consider it to be untrusted.

The TOFU approach can be used when connecting to arbitrary or unknown endpoints which do not have a [[trusted third party]] such as a [[certificate authority]]. For example, the [[Secure Shell|SSH]] protocol is designed to issue a prompt the first time the client connects to an unknown or not-yet-trusted endpoint. Other implementations of TOFU can be found in [[HTTP Public Key Pinning]] in which browsers will always accept the first public key returned by the server and with [[HTTP Strict Transport Security]] in which browsers will obey the redirection rule for the duration of 'age' directive.

==Model strengths and weaknesses==
The single largest strength of any TOFU-style model is that a human being must initially validate every interaction. A common application of this model is the use of ssh-rpc 'bot' users between computers, whereby public keys are distributed to a set of computers for automated access from centralized hosts. The TOFU aspect of this application forces a sysadmin (or other trusted user) to validate the remote server's identity upon first connection.

The largest weakness of any TOFU-style model is that a human being must initially validate every interaction, &lt;!--- this is doubled? ---&gt; which does not scale infinitely, and can quickly scale beyond the capabilities of any group of people using and managing computers with a need for trusted and secure protocols. People tend to approve without verification, not to mention the increased surface area for human error.

A compromise between security and scalability of use has been proposed by Daniel Gultsch the developer of the XMPP client [[Conversations (software)|Conversations]]. It is call [[Blind Trust Before Verification]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gultsch.de/trust.html|author=Daniel Gultsch|title=Blind Trust Before Verification|date=November 20, 2016|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it consists in not checking the key on first contact but to check after the user made a manual check and the key changed.

==First known use of the term==
The first known formal use of the term TOFU or TUFU was by CMU researchers Dan Wendlandt, David Andersen, and Adrian Perrig in their research paper "Perspectives: Improving SSH-Style Host Authentication With Multi-Path Probing" published in 2008 at the Usenix Annual Technical Conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix08/tech/full_papers/wendlandt/wendlandt_html/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moxie Marlinspike]] mentioned Perspectives and the term TOFU the [[DEF CON]] 18 proceedings, with reference to comments made by [[Dan Kaminsky]], during the panel discussion "An Open Letter, A Call to Action". An audience suggestion was raised implying the superiority of the [[Secure Shell|SSH]] [[Public key infrastructure]] (PKI) model, over the [[SSL/TLS]] PKI model - whereby Moxie replied:

{{quote|'''Anonymous''': "...so, if we dislike the certificate model in the (tls) PKI, but we like, say, the SSH PKI, which seems to work fairly well, basically the fundamental thing is: if I give my data to someone, I trust them with the data.  So I should be remembering their certificate. If someone else comes in with a different certificate, signed by a different authority, I still don't trust them.  And if we did it that way, then that would solve a lot of the problems- it would solve the problems of rogue CAs, to some extent, it wouldn't help you with the initial bootstrapping but the initial bootstrapping would use the initial model, and then for continued interaction with the site you would use the ssh model which would allow you continued strength beyond what we have now.  So the model we have now can be continued to be re-used, for only the initial acceptance.  So why don't we do this?"

'''Dan''': "So, I'm a former SSH developer, and let me walk very quickly, every time there's an error in the ssh key generation, the user is asked, 'please type yes to trusting this new key', or, 'please go into your known hosts file and delete that value', and every last time they do it, because it's ''always'' the fault of a server misconfiguration.  The SSH model is cool, ''it don't scale".

'''Moxie''': "'''And I would just add, what you're talking about is called 'Trust on First Use', or 'tofu'''', and there's a project that I'm involved in called perspectives, that tries to leverage that to be less confusing than the pure SSH model, and I think it's a really great project and you should check it out if you're interested in alternatives to the CA system."
}}

==Related work on the subject==
* Work toward creating visual representations of server certificate 'fingerprint' hashes has been implemented into [[OpenSSH]] in the form of [[ASCII Art]].  The intention is for users to visually recognize a 'graphical' image, instead of a long string of letters and numbers.  The original research paper was written by [[Adrian Perring]] and [[Dawn Song]], at the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] Computer Science Department.
* The originator of the 'TUFU' acronym was describing the inspiration for the '[[Perspectives Firefox Plug In]]', which was designed to strengthen the [[SSL/TLS]] PKI model by contacting network notaries whenever your browser connects an [[HTTPS]] website

==Prior work==
The topics of trust, validation, [[non-repudiation]] are fundamental to all work in the field of [[cryptography]] and [[digital security]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3180">In the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), a '''vanity domain''' is a domain name whose purpose is to express the individuality of the person on whose behalf it is registered.  This contrasts with domain names which resolve to an organisation (e.g. a company) or a service that organisation offers.  Vanity domains may be compared with [[Vanity plate|vanity car registration plates]], which similarly identify their owner as an individual and not just someone relying on another organisation's services.

A [[subdomain]] of an ISP's domain that is aliased to an individual user account is a vanity domain. Other definitions include:
* the [[Free On-line Dictionary of Computing]] defines it as "A domain you register for the sole purpose of having your own domain so you can have an easily remembered URL and e-mail address",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foldoc.org/vanity+domain |title=Vanity domain |date=11 September 1997 |work=Free On-line Dictionary of Computing |accessdate=11 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* while the [[Jargon File]] defines it as "An Internet domain, particularly in the .com or .org top-level domains, apparently created for no reason other than boosting the creator's ego."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/V/vanity-domain.html |title=Vanity domain |author= |date= |work= |publisher=CATB.org |accessdate=16 September 2010}} vanity domain&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Sun [[Sun Java System Messaging Server|iPlanet Messaging Server]] uses &lt;code&gt;msgVanityDomain&lt;/code&gt; to set up a domain name for e-mail use which is not fully hosted.
These uses apply primarily to regular domain names registered at the highest allowed level rather than subdomains (although, technically speaking, a second-level domain is actually a subdomain of its top-level domain).

Because vanity domains are operated for or on behalf of individuals, they typically will not offer the full complement of services an organisational domain name (or rather, the [[Host (network)|host]] that it points to) would be expected to honour; for example, the DNS record may contain only an MX record identifying a [[mail server]] accepting [[e-mail]] for that domain (which may itself be an [[e-mail forwarding]] server) and an A record identifying a [[shared web hosting service]] only offering [[HTTP]] (which may itself be a [[URL redirection]] service).

As well as being easily remembered, vanity domains (especially when registered at the highest level allowed by the [[domain name registrar|registrar]]) offer the advantage of [[personal mobility]]; they continue to be associated with a person even when that person switches service providers.

== Use of top-level domains ==
A [[top-level domain]] can become part of a vanity URL. Taking advantage of countries that do not ask for proof of residence to register their [[country code top-level domain|country-specific TLDs (Top Level Domains)]] can allow a user to incorporate the two or three letters following the dot, using them to help spell out the desired name, word or phrase.

[[File:A Brawl with Finnish Contrabandists by Vasili Khudiakov.jpg|thumb|325px|Finnish Smugglers]]
'''Vasily Grigorievich Khudyakov''' (Russian: Василий Григорьевич Худяков; 24 December 1825, Akshuat, [[Ulyanovsk Oblast]] - 26 July 1871, [[Saint Petersburg]]) was a Russian history, portrait and [[Genre art|genre]] painter.

==Biography ==
He began his studies at the [[Stroganov Moscow State University of Arts and Industry]], then spent almost two years at the [[Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]] (MSPSA). His mentor there was Professor {{ill|Fyodor Zav'yalov|ru|Завьялов, Фёдор Семёнович}}, who invited him to be an assistant for decorative work that was being done in the entrance hall of [[Kremlin Palace]].&lt;ref name="T"&gt;[http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/collection/_show/author/_id/384 Brief biography] @ the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his paintings were shown at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], where they received a silver medal.&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.artsait.ru/art/h/hudykov/main.htm Brief biography] @ Russian Paintings.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1848, he went to Saint Petersburg and audited classes at the Academy. In his rush to be named a "Free Artist", he accepted a silver medal and passed up the opportunity to compete for a gold one.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; After that, he mostly painted portraits on commission. In 1851, upon completing one of Dean [[Avraam Melnikov]], he was named an "Academician". 

Among other notable works at this time were "Finnish Smugglers", one of the first two works purchased by [[Pavel Tretyakov]] for his gallery,&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; and "Persecution of Christians in the East", purchased by Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] as a gift to King [[Otto of Greece]].

In 1856, he visited France and Italy; staying in Paris, Rome and Naples for about four years while continuing to execute commissions for members of the Russian nobility. On the basis of these works, he was named a Professor by the Academy in 1860. After returning, he became a teacher at the MSPSA. In 1862, he moved to Saint Petersburg, where he continued to exhibit frequently.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; He died of [[cholera]] in 1871.

[[File:Lateranspalast 1.jpg|thumb|255px|right|The San Giovanni in Laterano square with the Lateran Palace (left) and the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano (right).]]
The '''Vatican Historical Museum''' ({{lang-it|Museo storico vaticano}}) is one of the sections of the [[Vatican Museums]]. It was founded in 1973 at the behest of [[Pope Paul VI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guida ai musei e alla Città del Vaticano. Ediz. inglese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yONbB1g9zcC|accessdate=9 May 2013|year=1986|publisher=Edizioni Musei Vaticani|isbn=978-88-86921-11-4|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was initially hosted in environments under the Square Garden. In 1987 it was moved to the main floor of the [[Lateran Palace|Apostolic Palace of the Lateran]] and opened in March 1991.

The Vatican Historical Museum has a unique collection of [[portraits]] of the Popes from the sixteenth century to date, the memorable items of the [[Papal Military Corps]] of the 16–17th centuries and old religious paraphernalia related to rituals of the papacy. Also on display on the lower floor are the ''[[Popemobile|papamobili]]'' (Popemobiles); carriages and motorcars of Popes and Cardinals, including the first cars used by Popes.&lt;ref name=Storico&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.060608.it/en/cultura-e-svago/beni-culturali/musei/museo-storico-vaticano-san-giovanni.html|title= Museo Storico Vaticano (San Giovanni)|accessdate=9 May 013|publisher=060608.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
The Lateran Palace, which is next to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]] to its left within the courtyard of the church with a common entry gate, is a large apartment complex of the Pope. [[Domenico Fontana]] was the architect of this palace which was built to his design in 1586. Right at the entrance the staircase is a massive and impressive structure with the ceiling decorated with frescoes. It had been refurbished by [[Pope Paul IV]] into ten halls; each of these halls had frescoes of the Mannerist Age. The hall known as the Conciliation, and was provided with allegories related to the papacy of [[Sixtus V]]. The other halls were named Constantine, Hall of [[Apostles]], Emperors Room, Popes Room and so forth. The fresco decorations were on themes of the [[History of Rome]], episodes of the Bible related to [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]], [[David]], [[Solomon]], [[Samuel]] and others, and also related to the [[Gospel]]. Several colourful tapestries and Goblins added to the aesthetic elegance of the halls. Before the History Museum decided to relocate here to a more luxurious locale, none of the rooms had been allowed to be used for any general public purpose. Since 1991, these rooms have been exclusively used as exhibition or display rooms for the exhibits moved from the [[Vatican Museums]].&lt;ref name=Storico/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palace&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lazio-directory.org/palazzolaterano.htm|title=Lateran Palace Historical Museum and the Vatican|language=Italian|accessdate=9 May 2013|publisher= Lazio-Directory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==
The museum has been arranged into two wings. The principal wing is the museum of all artistic and historic importance starting with the paintings of the history of the Papal States, portraits of Popes till date, memorabilia of the Papal Military Corps including the navy, documents related to ceremonial orders of Popes, the Papal household items, and various ceremonial regalia and religious vessels and insignia not in use.&lt;ref name=Palace/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wings&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museionline.info/tipologia/item/museo-storico-vaticano.html|title=Museo Storico Vaticano|language=Italian|accessdate=9 May 2013|publisher= Museionline.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wing is an annex wing on the ground floor where the ''[[Popemobile|papamobili]]'' are on display; these consist of decorated carriages, saddles, sedans, wagons and the first cars used by the Popes.&lt;ref name=Palace/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wings/&gt;

The '''WikiLeaks Party''' was a micro political party in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/parties_and_representatives/party_registration/registered_parties/Wikileaks.htm |title=The Wikileaks Party |publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |date=2011-01-10 |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theaustralian"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jared| last=Owens| title=Julian Assange wants full control of Wikileaks Party, says party figure |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/julian-assange-wants-full-control-of-Wikileaks-party-says-party-figure/story-fn59niix-1226854795684|publisher=The Australian | date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite news|last=Khazan|first=Olga|title=Julian Assange wants to start a Wikileaks party and run for office|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/12/assange-Wikileaks-party-australia|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was created in part to support [[Julian Assange]]'s failed bid for a Senate seat in Australia in the 2013 election, where they won 0.66% of the national vote.&lt;ref name=WP /&gt; The WikiLeaks Party national council consisted of: [[Julian Assange]], Matt Watt, Gail Malone, John Shipton, Omar Todd and [[Gerry Georgatos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Wikileaksparty.org.au/about/national-council/ |title=Wikileaks Party National Council |publisher=Wikileaksparty.org.au |date= |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

Julian Assange's decision to run for the [[Australian Senate]] was announced via the WikiLeaks Twitter account in March 2012.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|title=Julian Assange to run for Senate|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-03-17/julian-assange-to-run-for-senate/3895958|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent to form a WikiLeaks Party was announced by Assange in late 2012,&lt;ref name=WP /&gt;&lt;ref name=TA&gt;{{cite news|last=Dorling|first=Philip|title=Assange looks to contest Senate election|url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/political-news/assange-looks-to-contest-senate-election-20121212-2ba43.html|publisher=The Age National Times|accessdate=7 March 2013|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Assange stated that the party was to be a vehicle for his candidacy for a seat in the Australian Senate in the 2013 election.&lt;ref name=WP /&gt;&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite web|title=Assange to run for Australian Senate, start Wikileaks party|url=http://rt.com/news/juilan-assange-Wikileaks-senate-900|publisher=rt.com|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 2013 the WikiLeaks Party submitted its registrations to the Australian Electoral Commission. The party had over 1300 fee-paying members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Polls positive for Wikileaks, as party registers|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/polls-positive-for-Wikileaks-as-party-registers-20130422-2iaqu.html|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application was accepted and the party was registered as a political party on 2 July 2013.&lt;ref name=Registration&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikileaks Party registered for election|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/Wikileaks-party-registered-for-election/story-fn3dxiwe-1226673288053|publisher=The Australian|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was involved in [[Glenn Druery]]'s [[Minor Party Alliance]] around the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], but left after deciding not to preference as per Druery's advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dylan Welch |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-31/promoting-people-power-or-gaming-the-system-meet/5357614 |title=Promoting people power or gaming the system?

===Julian Assange===
{{Main article|Julian Assange}}
Assange is a native of Australia.&lt;ref name=WP /&gt; Since July 2012 Assange has lived in the [[Embassy of Ecuador, London]], having been granted [[political asylum]] by Ecuador in an attempt to avoid arrest by UK authorities.&lt;ref name=Boston&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikileaks founder seeks asylum at Ecuador embassy |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/latinamerica/articles/2012/06/19/Wikileaks_founder_seeks_asylum_at_ecuador_embassy/ |publisher=boston.com |accessdate=7 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701034145/http://www.boston.com/news/world/latinamerica/articles/2012/06/19/Wikileaks_founder_seeks_asylum_at_ecuador_embassy/ |archivedate=1 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange is unable to leave the Embassy without being arrested by the [[Police Forces of the United Kingdom]] acting on an [[extradition]] order placed on him to travel to [[Sweden]] to answer [[Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority|allegations of rape and sexual molestation]] of two Swedish women. Assange fought the extradition order in the UK Court system from December 2010, however, subsequently both the UK [[High Court of Justice]] and the UK [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] ruled that the extradition order had been lawfully made and duly dismissed Assange's request for an appeal against the extradition warrant.&lt;ref name="Assange Extradition"&gt;{{cite news|title=Julian Assange loses extradition appeal at Supreme Court|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18260914|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 May 2012|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK Supreme Court"&gt;{{cite web|title=Julian Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority|url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/news/julian-assange-v-swedish-prosecution-authority.html|publisher=UK Supreme Court|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Statesman"&gt;{{cite web|title=The legal mythology of the extradition of Julian Assange|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2012/09/assange-and-legal-myths|publisher=New Statesman|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 election ===

The party fielded candidates for the Australian Senate in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikileaks expands bid for senate seats – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-06/Wikileaks-expands-bid-for-senate-seats/4613746|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two polling experts rated the WikiLeaks Party's electoral chances as ''highly unlikely''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/assange-will-struggle-to-win-senate-seat-poll-20130416-2hxlc.html#ixzz2cblDxWAC |title=Assange will struggle to win Senate seat: poll |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=2013-04-16 |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christine Milne]], leader of the [[Australian Greens]], was positive about the emergence of the WikiLeaks Party as part of a move away from Australia's two-party system. However, the Greens said they had no intention of stepping aside for Assange in the Victoria Senate election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AAP|title=Greens leader welcomes Wikileaks Party|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/latest/a/-/latest/16610680/greens-leader-welcomes-Wikileaks-party/|work=Yahoo! 7 News|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Socialist Equality Party (Australia)|Socialist Equality Party]] reaffirmed its intention to defend Assange against persecution but refused to endorse the WikiLeaks Party, stating that this position represents the "interests of the working class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=Patrick|title=Why the SEP does not endorse the Wikileaks Party|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2013/05/20/wiki-m20.html|work=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|publisher=International Committee of the Fourth International|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Anne Twomey, an expert on [[Australian constitutional law]] at the [[University of Sydney]], suggested that if Assange were elected, this could be found invalid in the event of a legal challenge if a court ruled that his relationship with Ecuador breached the prohibition against the election of people "under any [acknowledgement] of allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power".&lt;ref name=Twomey&gt;{{cite web|last=Twomey|first=Anne|title=Senator Assange?|url=http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/cru/2013/04/senator_assange.html|work=Constitutional Critique|publisher=Constitutional Reform Unit, Sydney Law School|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's campaign was thrown into turmoil just weeks before the election when members objected strongly to the party's voting preferences - see [[single transferable vote]]. In New South Wales, a fascist group was placed above the [[Australian Greens|Greens]], while in Western Australia the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] was placed above Greens Senator [[Scott Ludlam]], a strong supporter of WikiLeaks and Assange. The WikiLeaks Party blamed an unspecified "admin error" and announced an independent review would be held after the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=August 21, 2013 |url=http://www.Wikileaksparty.org.au/the-Wikileaks-party-announces-independent-review/ |title=The Wikileaks Party Announces Independent Review |publisher=Wikileaksparty.org.au |date=2013-08-21 |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When National Council members complained, CEO John Shipton attempted to subvert them and create a new power base. [[Leslie Cannold]], Assange's running mate in Victoria, resigned along with many volunteers and members of the National Council.

The party published a short, inconclusive review by a party member five months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Wikileaksparty.org.au/downloads/Wikileaks%20Party%20Independent%20Review.pdf |title=Wikileaks Party Independent Review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former member Gary Lord responded with a comprehensive 20-page report fully examining the party's failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jaraparilla|title=My Wikileaks Party Inquiry|url=http://jaraparilla.blogspot.com.au/2014/03/my-Wikileaks-party-inquiry.html|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assange failed in his bid for a Senate seat. It is difficult to separate out his personal vote under the single transferable vote system. The party received 33,683 votes in Victoria from electors who voted the WikiLeaks ticket, with Assange at its head, and Assange received an additional 8,016 first preference votes from electors who numbered the candidates individually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://results.aec.gov.au/17496/Website/SenateStateFirstPrefs-17496-VIC.htm Election 2013: First preferences by candidate for Victoria,] Australian Electoral Commission. Accessed 17 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The party as a whole received 1.24%, the 7th highest primary vote in Victoria, and reached the 26th round of ballot before being eliminated without the opportunity to receive preference flows.  The party received 88,100 votes or 0.66% nationally but only contested seats in three States. [[Gerry Georgatos]] came closest to winning a Senate seat for the WikiLeaks Party, reaching the 19th round with only seven rounds to go before being eliminated, also before any opportunity to receive preference flows. He fell about 3,000 primary votes short of being elected, but given that the party received only 9,767 primary votes in Western Australia, this was a large gap.&lt;ref name="AEC 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=First Preferences by Group – Victoria|url=http://vtr.aec.gov.au/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-17496-NAT.htm|work=Election 2013: Virtual Tally Room|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=7 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012010411/http://vtr.aec.gov.au/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-17496-NAT.htm|archivedate=12 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Party platform===
The WikiLeaks Party subscribes to a libertarian ideology. Specific policies for the 2013 election included: introduction of a national shield law to protect a reporter's right not to reveal a source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protect your sources: Australia's Wikileaks Party calls for journalism shield law – RT News|url=http://rt.com/news/Wikileaks-journalist-protect-law-193/|publisher=RT News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and; "promoting free information and protection for whistle-blowers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearlman |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/10258915/Wikileaks-Party-in-chaos-as-Assange-running-mate-quits.html |title=Wikileaks Party in chaos as Assange running mate quits – |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=2013-08-22 |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEO John Shipton stated that "The party stands for what Julian espouses — transparency and [[accountability]] in government and of course human rights."&lt;ref name=NA&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikileaks founder Julian Assange now a step closer to a Senate run|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-news/Wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-now-a-step-closer-to-a-senate-run/story-fncynjr2-1226577310265|publisher=news.com.au|accessdate=7 March 2013|date=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange himself has said the WikiLeaks Party would combine "a small, centralised leadership with maximum grassroots involvement," and that the party would advance WikiLeaks' objectives of promoting openness in government and politics, and that it would combat intrusions on individual privacy.&lt;ref name=WP /&gt;&lt;ref name=TA /&gt;&lt;ref name=TC&gt;{{cite web|last=Creagh|first=Sunanda|title='Wikileaks Party will attract the support of many women': Assange|url=http://theconversation.edu.au/Wikileaks-party-will-attract-the-support-of-many-women-assange-12246|publisher=The Conversation|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SC&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikileaks Party will attract female voters: Assange|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1738052/Wikileaks-Party-will-attract-female-voters-Assange|publisher=World News Australia|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice of Russia stated that Shipton in an interview "praised Russian diplomatic skills and Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Shipton and the WikiLeaks Party believe that the Russian President and Foreign Ministry are forces for peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://voiceofrussia.com/2014_02_05/The-US-and-its-allies-a-horror-show-that-must-stop-John-Shipton-9806/ |title=The US and its allies: a horror show that must stop – John Shipton |publisher=The Voice of Russia |date=2013-12-26 |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assange has been reported as saying that he envisions the WikiLeaks Party as bound together by unswerving commitment to the core principles of [[civic courage]] nourished by understanding and truthfulness and the free flow of information, and one that will practise in politics what WikiLeaks has done in the field of information.&lt;ref name=TC2&gt;{{cite web|last=Keane|first=John|title=Lunch and dinner with Julian Assange, in prison|url=https://theconversation.edu.au/lunch-and-dinner-with-julian-assange-in-prison-12234|publisher=The Conversation|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution of the WikiLeaks Party lists objectives, including: the protection of human rights and freedoms; transparency of governmental and [[corporate action]], policy and information; recognition of the need for [[Social inequality|equality]] between generations; and support of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] [[self-determination]].&lt;ref name=TC2 /&gt; The WikiLeaks Political party has criticised the Telstra Group's relationship with the FBI and US Department of Justice.&lt;ref name="EPR"&gt;{{cite news |author=Butler, Philip |url=http://everything-pr.com/Wikileaks-party-wants-answers/244074/#.UfgaEY0RqAg |work=Everything PR |title=Wikileaks Party Wants Answers from Telstra Group on Tempora-like Snooping | date=14 July 2013 | accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sbs.com.au/podcasts/Podcasts/radionews/episode/277466/Is-the-US-listening-to-your-calls | publisher = SBS | title = Is the US listening to your calls? | accessdate = 30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syria visit==
In December 2013 a delegation from the party, including its chairman John Shipton, visited Syria and met with President [[Bashar al-Assad]] with the goals of demonstrating "solidarity with the Syrian people and their nation" and improving the party's understanding of the country's civil war. In a statement issued shortly before the visit, the WikiLeaks Party stated that it opposed outside intervention in the war, supported a negotiated peace process, and described reports of the [[Ghouta chemical attack]] by forces loyal to al-Assad in August 2013 as being "unsubstantiated" and comparable to the concerns which were raised over the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction program prior to the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikileaks under fire after delegation travels to Syria to meet Bashar al-Assad|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-31/Wikileaks-meets-assad-in-syria/5180036|accessdate=31 December 2013|newspaper=ABC News|date=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Gail|title=Notes from Damascus|url=http://www.Wikileaksparty.org.au/notes-from-damascus/|publisher=Wikileaks Party|accessdate=31 December 2013|date=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting with President al-Assad was attended by National Council members John Shipton, Gail Malone and by former National Council member Jamal Daoud.&lt;ref name="theaustralian"/&gt;

The meeting with Assad was criticized by the Australian Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and many WikiLeaks supporters. Shipton stated that the meeting with al-Assad was "just a matter of good manners", and that the delegation had also met with members of the Syrian opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKenny|first=Leesha|title=Wikileaks Party defends its 'cup of tea' with Bashar al-Assad|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/Wikileaks-party-defends-its-cup-of-tea-with-bashar-alassad-20131231-304ne.html|accessdate=1 January 2014|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 January 2014|author2=Wroe, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; These meetings with the opposition have not been verified.

==2014 election==

The WikiLeaks Party contested the April 5 re-run of the disqualified 2013 Senate election (Western Australia component). The prior year's lead Senate Candidate Gerry Georgatos recommended to the National Council that he step down for Julian Assange to take the lead Senate position for Western Australia and hopefully get elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-04/Wikileaks-julian-assange-wa-senate-recount-aec/5068548 |title=Julian Assange to contest any fresh WA Senate vote, Wikileaks Party says, calling out AEC 'discrimination' |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2013-11-04 |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in February the National Council learned that Julian Assange would be ineligible to contest. Gerry Georgatos rejected continuing on as the endorsed candidate and asked that the membership be surveyed as to their preferred candidate. More than 500 WikiLeaks members completed the survey and Gerry Georgatos was endorsed as the lead candidate with West TV producer Tibor Meszaros at number 2 and journalist Lucy Nicol at number 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/schapelle-corby-conspiracy-theorist-to-stand-for-Wikileaks-party-in-wa-senate-byelection-20140312-34lsj.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Schapelle Corby conspiracy theorist to stand for Wikileaks Party in WA Senate byelection}}&lt;/ref&gt; But one hour before the close of nominations Gerry Georgatos withdrew for "unforeseen personal reasons" and Tibor Meszaros was consequently elevated to lead candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/schapelle-corby-conspiracy-theorist-withdraws-as-Wikileaks-candidate-in-wa-senate-election-20140314-34q4o.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Schapelle Corby conspiracy theorist withdraws as Wikileaks candidate in WA Senate election}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-14/Wikileaks-candidate-replacing-assange-in-wa-senate-withdraws/5319994 |title=WA Wikileaks candidate pulls out of Senate race |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2014-03-14 |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, the AEC draw for the ballot of 33 parties (77 candidates) drew The WikiLeaks Party first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-14/record-number-of-candidates-for-wa-senate-election/5321802 |title=Record number of candidates for WA Senate election |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2014-03-14 |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deregistration==
The WikiLeaks Party was deregistered by the Australian Electoral Commission on 23 July 2015, under s.137(4) of the ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918|Electoral Act]]'': failure to respond to notice under s.137(1).&lt;ref name=dereg&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wikileaks Party|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Deregistered_parties/Wikileaks.htm|website=aec.gov.au|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
