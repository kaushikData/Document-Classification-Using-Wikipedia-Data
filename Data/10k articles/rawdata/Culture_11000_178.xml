'''420''', '''4:20''', or '''4/20'''  (pronounced '''four-twenty''') is slang in [[cannabis culture]] for the consumption of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], especially smoking cannabis around the time 4:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. (or 16:20 in [[24-hour notation]]) and smoking cannabis in celebration on the date April 20 (which is 4/20 in [[Date and time notation in the United States|U.S. form]]).&lt;ref name=UCSC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2007/April/24/local/stories/08local.htm  |title=Thousands at UCSC burn one to mark cannabis holiday |first=Matt |last=King |date=April 24, 2007 |work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070426081319/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2007/April/24/local/stories/08local.htm |archivedate = April 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, cannabis aficionados were using "420" as a code for smoking and using it as a sign-off on flyers for concerts where the drug would be plentiful.

==International day for cannabis-related protests and events==
[[File:Vancouver Canada 2012 April 20 crowd.jpg|thumb||Vancouver, April 20, 2012]]

On that day many marijuana users protest in [[civil disobedience]] by gathering in public to light up at 4:20&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marijuana's big day is here: '420' celebrations ready to roll|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/04/19/marijuanas-big-day-here-420-celebrations-ready-roll/100663642/|publisher=USA TODAY|accessdate=April 22, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As marijuana continues to be decriminalized and legalized around the world, [[Steve DeAngelo]], cannabis activist and founder of California's [[Harborside Health Center]], notes that "even if our activist work were complete, 420 morphs from a statement of conscience to a celebration of acceptance, a celebration of victory, a celebration of our amazing connection with this plant" and that he thinks that "it will always be worthy of celebration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does 4/20 Still Matter?|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/does-420-still-matter-w477104|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual 420 pot rally will be more celebration than protest: Organizers|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2016/04/17/annual-420-pot-rally-will-be-more-celebration-than-protest-organizers|publisher=Toronto Sun|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

==Other impacts==
===Traffic safety===
Using 25 years of U.S. national data, one study found a 12% increase in the risk of [[Traffic collision|fatal motor vehicle crash]] between 4:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. and midnight on April 20 compared to identical time intervals on control days. Among the subgroup of drivers less than 21 years of age, risks were 38% higher on April 20 than on control days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staples|first1=John A.|last2=Redelmeier|first2=Donald A.|title=The April 20 Cannabis Celebration and Fatal Traffic Crashes in the United States|journal=[[JAMA Internal Medicine]]|date=2018|volume=178|issue=4|pages=569|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2017.8298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stolen signs===
Signs bearing the number ''420'' have been frequently stolen. In Colorado, the [[Colorado Department of Transportation]] replaced the Mile Marker 420 sign on [[I-70]] east of Denver with one reading 419.99 in an attempt to stop the thievery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/11/colorado-changes-sign-thieves/4435753/|title=State alters 420 MM sign to thwart thieves |work=[[USA TODAY]] |accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the sign post should appear just east of Flagler, Colorado, travelling east from exit 419 one now only sees mile post 419, and then 2 miles farther sees mile post 421 (as noted after July 2017). The [[Idaho Department of Transportation]] (ITD) replaced the Mile Marker 420 sign on U.S. Highway 95, just south of [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]], with Mile Marker 419.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktvb.com/story/news/local/idaho/2015/08/18/idaho-replaces-mile-marker-420-with-4199-to-thwart-stoners/31928433/|title=Idaho replaces mile marker 420 with 419.9 to thwart stoners|work=[[KTVB]]|accessdate=August 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820184544/http://www.ktvb.com/story/news/local/idaho/2015/08/18/idaho-replaces-mile-marker-420-with-4199-to-thwart-stoners/31928433/|archive-date=August 20, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Goodhue County, Minnesota]], officials have changed "420&amp;nbsp;St" street signs to "42x&amp;nbsp;St".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postbulletin.com/news/local/after-deadline-county-finds-fix-for-missing-signs/article_b88939fb-3c91-5523-b41e-a3b6c2dff8e4.html|title=County finds fix for missing 420 signs|work=[[Post-Bulletin]]|accessdate=July 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430012124/http://www.postbulletin.com/news/local/after-deadline-county-finds-fix-for-missing-signs/article_b88939fb-3c91-5523-b41e-a3b6c2dff8e4.html|archive-date=April 30, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
In 2003, [[California Senate Bill 420]] was introduced to regulate medical marijuana use, in deliberate reference to the status of 420 in marijuana culture. An unsuccessful 2010 bill to legalize [[cannabis in Guam]] was called Bill 420.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Only one shows up for pot bill |url=http://mvguam.com/local/news/13221-only-one-shows-up-for-pot-bill.html |title=Only one shows up for pot bill |publisher=Mvguam.com |date=July 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715182329/http://mvguam.com/local/news/13221-only-one-shows-up-for-pot-bill.html |archivedate=July 15, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dial-code of the Czech Republic===

He would later use the number as one of the dollar amounts in the "Face the Devil" bonus round of his 2017 reboot of the classic [[United States|American]] TV [[game show]] ''[[The Joker's Wild]]''.

===Honors===
Following the success of Washington D.C.'s [[Initiative 71]] to legalize cannabis in 2014, Mayor [[Muriel Bowser]] granted [[Vehicle registration plates of Washington, D.C.|license plate]] number ''420'' to the campaign's leader, [[Adam Eidinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D.C. mayor offers pot activist Tag 420 for his efforts|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/03/13/d-c-mayor-offers-special-420-license-plate-to-pot-activist/|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Mão e a Luva''''' (''The Hand and the Glove'') is a [[romance novel]] written by [[Brazil]]ian author [[Machado de Assis]] (1839–1908) and published in 1874. The [[book]] is a [[psychology|psychological]] analysis of [[society]] and of ''false [[naivety]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.machadodeassis.net/hiperTx_romances/obras/amaoealuva.htm |title=A Mão e a Luva |publisher=machadodeassis.net |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710054951/http://www.machadodeassis.net/hiperTx_romances/obras/amaoealuva.htm |archivedate=10 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story ==
The story revolves around Guiomar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundovestibular.com.br/articles/435/1/A-MAO-E-A-LUVA---Machado-De-Assis-Resumo/Paacutegina1.html|title=A Mão e a Luva – Machado de Assis, Resumo|publisher=Mundo Vestibular|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 17-year-old girl, goddaughter to a [[baron]]ess. Guiomar wishes to raise her [[social position]] and is sought after by three men: Jorge, Estêvão and Luís Alves. Estêvão loves her crazily, purely and innocently – she is his first love. Jorge, nephew to the baroness and her obvious favorite, sees Guiomar as a path to ''social climbing'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Freud e Machado de Assis, uma Interseção entre Psicanálise e Literatura|page=63|last=Freitas|first=Luís Alberto Pinheiro de|publisher=Mauad|place=Rio de Janeiro|edition=2|year=2001|isbn=978-85-7478-056-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has "a lustful kind of love", as described by the author. Luís Alves is a middle-term: his intentions are of an ambitious nature, but throughout the book he gradually becomes fond of Guiomar.

Jorge, with the support of the baroness and her British maid, Mrs. Oswald, requests Guiomar's hand in marriage. On the following day, Luís Alves asks as well. The baroness leaves the decision in Guiomar's hands, and, between the two admirers, she chooses Jorge, but the baroness knows she actually wants to marry Luís Alves. She actually marries Luís Alves and the end of the book justifies the title.

The Arabic periodical '''''al-Bayān''''' (English: "announcement" or "declaration") was published once or twice a month from 1 March 1897 until 16 August 1898. It was edited in [[Cairo]] by [[Ibrahim al-Yaziji|Ibrahīm Al-Yāziǧī]] (1847–1906)&lt;ref&gt;Père Paul Soueid: Ibrahim Al-Yazigi, L'Homme et son Œuvre, Beirut 1969, pp.8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bišāra Zalzal (1851–1905) and was the successor of the medical journal ''[[At-Tabib (magazine)|aṭ-Ṭabīb]]'' (1884–1885). Since 1898, Al-Yāziǧī, a linguist and journalist from Lebanon, particularly built up his reputation as the chief editor of the journal [[Ad-Diya|''aḍ-Ḍiyāʾ'']] (1898-1906).&lt;ref&gt;Père Paul Soueid: Ibrahim Al-Yazigi, L'Homme et son Œuvre, Beirut 1969, pp.106-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from scientific articles, al-Bayān focuses on cultural and anthropological topics such as language and education.&lt;ref&gt;al-Bayān, 1st volume, 1st issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Intelligence demonstrated by machines}}
{{Artificial intelligence}}
&lt;!-- DEFINITIONS --&gt;
'''Artificial intelligence''' ('''AI'''), sometimes called '''[[machine]] intelligence''', is [[intelligence]] demonstrated by [[machine]]s, in contrast to the '''[[natural]] intelligence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; displayed by humans and other animals.  In [[computer science]]  AI research is defined as the study of "[[intelligent agent]]s": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.&lt;ref name="Definition of AI"/&gt; Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other [[human mind]]s, such as "learning" and "problem solving".{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|p=2}}

The scope of AI is disputed: as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring "intelligence" are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the [[AI effect]], leading to the quip in Tesler's Theorem, "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~maloof/cosc270.f17/cosc270-intro-handout.pdf|title=Artificial Intelligence: An Introduction, p. 37|last=Maloof|first=Mark|date=|website=georgetown.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[optical character recognition]] is frequently excluded from "artificial intelligence", having become a routine technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Schank |first=Roger C.  |title=Where's the AI |magazine=AI magazine |volume=12 |issue=4 |year=1991|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully [[natural language understanding|understanding human speech]],{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009}} competing at the highest level in [[strategic game]] systems (such as [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]]),&lt;ref name="bbc-alphago"/&gt; [[autonomous car|autonomously operating cars]], and intelligent routing in [[content delivery network]]s and [[military simulations]].

&lt;!-- SUMMARIZING HISTORY --&gt;
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,&lt;ref name="Optimism of early AI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AI in the 80s"/&gt; followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "[[AI winter]]"),&lt;ref name="First AI winter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Second AI winter"/&gt; followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.&lt;ref name="AI in the 80s"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AI in 2000s"/&gt; For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.&lt;ref name="Fragmentation of AI"/&gt; These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "[[robotics]]" or "machine learning"),&lt;ref name="Problems of AI"/&gt; the use of particular tools ("logic" or [[artificial neural network]]s), or deep philosophical differences.&lt;ref name="Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neats vs. scruffies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic"/&gt; Subfields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).&lt;ref name="Fragmentation of AI"/&gt;

&lt;!-- SUMMARIZING PROBLEMS, APPROACHES, TOOLS --&gt;
The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include [[automated reasoning|reasoning]], [[knowledge representation]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]], [[machine learning|learning]], [[natural language processing]], [[machine perception|perception]] and the ability to move and manipulate objects.&lt;ref name="Problems of AI"/&gt; [[artificial general intelligence|General intelligence]] is among the field's long-term goals.&lt;ref name="General intelligence"/&gt; Approaches include [[#Statistical|statistical methods]], [[#Sub-symbolic|computational intelligence]], and [[#Symbolic|traditional symbolic AI]]. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of [[#Search and optimization|search and mathematical optimization]], [[artificial neural network]]s, and [[#Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning|methods based on statistics, probability and economics]].

&lt;!-- PRE-20TH CENTURY. MAYBE TO BE KEPT SHORT. --&gt;
Thought-capable [[artificial being]]s appeared as [[storytelling device]]s in antiquity,&lt;ref name="AI in myth"/&gt; and have been common in fiction, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' or [[Karel Čapek]]'s ''[[R.U.R.

&lt;!-- MAJOR INTELLECTUAL PRECURSORS: LOGIC, THEORY OF COMPUTATION, CYBERNETICS, INFORMATION THEORY, EARLY NEURAL NETS --&gt;
The study of mechanical or [[formal reasoning|"formal" reasoning]] began with [[philosopher]]s and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to  [[Alan Turing]]'s [[theory of computation]], which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name="Formal reasoning"/&gt; Along with concurrent discoveries in [[Neuroscience|neurobiology]], [[information theory]] and [[cybernetic]]s, this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain. Turing proposed that "if a human could not distinguish between responses from a machine and a human, the machine could be considered “intelligent".&lt;ref&gt;"Artificial Intelligence."

&lt;!-- THE "GOLDEN YEARS" 1956-1974 --&gt;
The field of AI research was born at [[Dartmouth workshop|a workshop]] at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="Dartmouth conference"/&gt; Attendees [[Allen Newell]] ([[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]]), [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] ([[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]]), [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]), [[Marvin Minsky]] ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]) and [[Arthur Samuel]] ([[IBM]]) became the founders and leaders of AI research.&lt;ref name="Hegemony of the Dartmouth conference attendees"/&gt; They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing":{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18|quote=it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish}} computers were learning [[draughts|checkers]] strategies (c. 1954)&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer J.

Simon|Herbert Simon]] predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". [[Marvin Minsky]] agreed, writing, "within a generation&amp;nbsp;... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved".&lt;ref name="Optimism of early AI"/&gt;

&lt;!-- FIRST AI WINTER --&gt;
They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of [[Sir James Lighthill]]{{sfn|Lighthill|1973}} and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an "[[AI winter]]",&lt;ref name="First AI winter"/&gt; a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.

&lt;!-- BOOM OF THE 1980s, SECOND AI WINTER --&gt;
In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of [[expert system]]s,&lt;ref name="Expert systems"/&gt; a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's [[fifth generation computer]] project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research.&lt;ref name="AI in the 80s"/&gt; However, beginning with the collapse of the [[Lisp Machine]] market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting hiatus began.&lt;ref name="Second AI winter"/&gt;

&lt;!-- FORMAL METHODS RISING IN THE 90s --&gt;
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used for logistics, [[data mining]], [[medical diagnosis]] and other areas.&lt;ref name="AI widely used"/&gt; The success was due to increasing computational power (see [[Moore's law]]), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields (such as [[statistics]], [[economics]] and [[mathematical optimization|mathematics]]), and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards.&lt;ref name="Formal methods in AI"/&gt; [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]] became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, [[Garry Kasparov]], on 11 May 1997.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=480–483}}

== Basics ==
&lt;!-- This section is for explaining, to non-specialists, core concepts that are helpful for understanding AI; feel free to greatly expand or even draw out into its own "Introduction to AI" article, similar to [[Introduction to Quantum Mechanics]] --&gt;

A typical AI perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.&lt;ref name="Definition of AI"/&gt; An AI's intended [[utility function|goal function]] can be simple ("1 if the AI wins a game of [[Go (game)|Go]], 0 otherwise") or complex ("Do actions mathematically similar to the actions that got you rewards in the past"). Goals can be explicitly defined, or can be induced. If the AI is programmed for "[[reinforcement learning]]", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior and punishing others.{{efn|The act of doling out rewards can itself be formalized or automated into a "[[reward function]]".}} Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a "[[fitness function]]" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems; this is similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food, or how dogs can be bred via [[artificial selection]] to possess desired traits.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 5}} Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead reason by analogy; these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are somehow implicit in their training data.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 7}} Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose "goal" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenbaum, M., Markovitch, S., &amp; Rusakov, D. (2004). Selective sampling for nearest neighbor classifiers. Machine learning, 54(2), 125–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

AI often revolves around the use of [[algorithms]]. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.{{efn|Terminology varies; see [[algorithm characterizations]].}} A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following recipe for optimal play at [[tic-tac-toe]]:{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 1}}

# If someone has a "threat" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square. Otherwise,
# if a move "forks" to create two threats at once, play that move. Otherwise,
# take the center square if it is free. Otherwise,
# if your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner. Otherwise,
# take an empty corner if one exists. Otherwise,
# take any empty square.

Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] (strategies, or "rules of thumb", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms. Some of the "learners" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, if given infinite data, time, and memory, learn to approximate any [[function (mathematics)|function]], including whatever combination of mathematical functions would best describe the entire world. These learners could therefore, in theory, derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching it against the data. In practice, it is almost never possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of "[[combinatorial explosion]]", where the amount of time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering broad swaths of possibilities that are unlikely to be fruitful.&lt;ref name="Intractability"/&gt;{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 3}} For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from [[Denver]] to [[New York City|New York]] in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through [[San Francisco]] or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding an pathfinding algorithm like [[A*]] can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The earliest (and easiest to understand) approach to AI was symbolism (such as formal logic): "If an otherwise healthy adult has a fever, then they may have [[influenza]]". A second, more general, approach is [[Bayesian inference]]: "If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way". The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as [[Support vector machine|SVM]] and [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|nearest-neighbor]]: "After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza". A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the [[artificial neural network]] approach uses artificial "[[neurons]]" that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to "reinforce" connections that seemed to be useful. These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://artificial-future.com/artificial-intelligence | title= Algorithm in Artificial Intelligence }}&lt;/ref&gt; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 4, Chapter 6}}&lt;!-- The influenza example is expanded from Domingos chapter 6; feel free to put in a better example if you have one --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Can neural network computers learn from experience, and if so, could they ever become what we would call 'smart'?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-neural-network-comput/|accessdate=24 March 2018|work=Scientific American|date=2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Overfitted Data.png|thumb|The blue line could be an example of [[overfitting]] a linear function due to random noise.]]
Learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious, such as "since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well". They can be nuanced, such as "X% of [[Family (biology)|families]] have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is an Y% chance that undiscovered [[black swans]] exist". Learners also work on the basis of "[[Occam's razor#Probability theory and statistics|Occam's razor]]": The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest. Therefore, to be successful, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better. Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as [[overfitting]]. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 6, Chapter 7}} Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by "learning the wrong lesson". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=286}} A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don't determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an "adversarial" image that the system misclassifies.{{efn|Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. Some systems are so brittle that changing a single adversarial pixel predictably induces misclassification.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Single pixel change fools AI programs|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41845878|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=BBC News|date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AI Has a Hallucination Problem That's Proving Tough to Fix|url=https://www.wired.com/story/ai-has-a-hallucination-problem-thats-proving-tough-to-fix/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=WIRED|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodfellow, Ian J., Jonathon Shlens, and Christian Szegedy.

Compared with humans, existing AI lacks several features of human "[[commonsense reasoning]]"; most notably, humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about "[[naïve physics]]" such as space, time, and physical interactions. This enables even young children to easily make inferences like "If I roll this pen off a table, it will fall on the floor". Humans also have a powerful mechanism of "[[folk psychology]]" that helps them to interpret natural-language sentences such as "The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence". (A generic AI has difficulty inferring whether the councilmen or the demonstrators are the ones alleged to be advocating violence.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cultivating Common Sense {{!}} DiscoverMagazine.com|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2017/april-2017/cultivating-common-sense|accessdate=24 March 2018|work=Discover Magazine|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Ernest|last2=Marcus|first2=Gary|title=Commonsense reasoning and commonsense knowledge in artificial intelligence|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=24 August 2015|volume=58|issue=9|pages=92–103|doi=10.1145/2701413|url=https://m.cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191169-commonsense-reasoning-and-commonsense-knowledge-in-artificial-intelligence/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winograd|first1=Terry|title=Understanding natural language|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=January 1972|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–191|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(72)90002-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of "common knowledge" means that AI often makes different mistakes than humans make, in ways that can seem incomprehensible.

== Problems ==
&lt;!--- This is linked to in the introduction to the article and to the "AI research" section --&gt;

The overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.&lt;ref name="Problems of AI"/&gt;

=== Reasoning, problem solving ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;&lt;!-- SOLVED PROBLEMS --&gt;
Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.&lt;ref name="Reasoning"/&gt; By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with [[uncertainty|uncertain]] or incomplete information, employing concepts from [[probability]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="Uncertain reasoning"/&gt;

These algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems, because they experienced a "combinatorial explosion": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.&lt;ref name="Intractability"/&gt;  In fact, even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgements.&lt;ref name="Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning"/&gt;

=== Knowledge representation ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
[[File:GFO taxonomy tree.png|right|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.]]
{{Main|Knowledge representation|Commonsense knowledge}}

[[Knowledge representation]]&lt;ref name="Knowledge representation"/&gt; and [[knowledge engineering]]&lt;ref name="Knowledge engineering"/&gt; are central to classical AI research. Some "expert systems" attempt to gather together explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain. In addition, some projects attempt to gather the "commonsense knowledge" known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;&lt;ref name="Representing categories and relations"/&gt; situations, events, states and time;&lt;ref name="Representing time"/&gt; causes and effects;&lt;ref name="Representing causation"/&gt; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);&lt;ref name="Representing knowledge about knowledge"/&gt; and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of "what exists" is an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The [[semantics]] of these are captured as [[description logic]] concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the [[Web Ontology Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=June 2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829120912/https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |archivedate=29 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most general ontologies are called [[upper ontology|upper ontologies]], which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge&lt;ref name="Ontology"/&gt; by acting as mediators between [[Domain ontology|domain ontologies]] that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). Such formal knowledge representations can be used in content-based indexing and retrieval,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smoliar|first1=Stephen W.|last2=Zhang|first2=HongJiang|title=Content based video indexing and retrieval|journal=IEEE multimedia|date=1994|volume=1.2|pages=62–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; scene interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neumann|first1=Bernd|last2=Möller|first2=Ralf|title=On scene interpretation with description logics|journal=Image and Vision Computing|date=January 2008|volume=26|issue=1|pages=82–101|doi=10.1016/j.imavis.2007.08.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; clinical decision support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuperman|first1=G.

Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:
;[[Default reasoning]] and the [[qualification problem]]: Many of the things people know take the form of "working assumptions". For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] identified this problem in 1969&lt;ref name="Qualification problem"/&gt; as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.&lt;ref name="Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic"/&gt;
;The breadth of commonsense knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of [[commonsense knowledge]] (e.g., [[Cyc]]) require enormous amounts of laborious [[ontology engineering|ontological engineering]]—they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.&lt;ref name="Breadth of commonsense knowledge"/&gt;
;The subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it "feels too exposed"{{sfn|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}} or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake.{{sfn|Gladwell|2005}} These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain.&lt;ref name="Intuition"/&gt; Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that [[situated artificial intelligence|situated AI]], [[computational intelligence]], or [[#Statistical|statistical AI]] will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Intuition"/&gt;

=== Planning ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
[[File:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A [[hierarchical control system]] is a form of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.]]

{{Main|Automated planning and scheduling}}

Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.&lt;ref name="Planning"/&gt; They need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the [[utility]] (or "value") of available choices.&lt;ref name="Information value theory"/&gt;

In classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions.&lt;ref name="Classical planning"/&gt; However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions, but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.&lt;ref name="Non-deterministic planning"/&gt;

[[Multi-agent planning]] uses the [[cooperation]] and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. [[Emergent behavior]] such as this is used by [[evolutionary algorithms]] and [[swarm intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Multi-agent planning"/&gt;

=== Learning ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
{{Main|Machine learning}}

Machine learning, a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Turing]] discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]".{{Harv|Turing|1950}} In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, [[Ray Solomonoff]] wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: "An Inductive Inference Machine".{{Harv|Solomonoff|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.&lt;ref&gt;This is a form of [[Tom M. Mitchell|Tom Mitchell]]'s widely quoted definition of machine learning: "A computer program is set to learn from an experience ''E'' with respect to some task ''T'' and some performance measure ''P'' if its performance on ''T'' as measured by ''P'' improves with experience ''E''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Machine learning"/&gt;

[[Unsupervised learning]] is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/unsupervised-learning|title=What is Unsupervised Learning?|last=|first=|date=|website=deepai.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Supervised learning]] includes both [[statistical classification|classification]] and numerical [[Regression analysis|regression]], which requires a human to label the input data first. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change.&lt;ref name="Machine learning"/&gt; Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as "function approximators" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, "spam" or "not spam". [[Computational learning theory]] can assess learners by [[computational complexity]], by [[sample complexity]] (how much data is required), or by other notions of [[optimization theory|optimization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=M. I.|last2=Mitchell|first2=T. M.|title=Machine learning: Trends, perspectives, and prospects|journal=Science|date=16 July 2015|volume=349|issue=6245|pages=255–260|doi=10.1126/science.aaa8415|bibcode=2015Sci...349..255J}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[reinforcement learning]]&lt;ref name="Reinforcement learning"/&gt; the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.

=== Natural language processing ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
[[File:ParseTree.svg|thumb| A [[parse tree]] represents the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a sentence according to some [[formal grammar]].]]
{{Main|Natural language processing}}

[[Natural language processing]]&lt;ref name="Natural language processing"/&gt; (NLP) gives machines the ability to read and [[natural language understanding|understand]] human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable [[natural-language user interface]]s and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include [[information retrieval]], [[text mining]], [[question answering]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis "Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201125047/http://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis |date=1 February 2016 }}, Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119–142, 2011
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[machine translation]].&lt;ref name="Applications of natural language processing"/&gt; Many current approaches use word co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text. "Keyword spotting" strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb; a search query for "dog" might only match documents with the literal word "dog" and miss a document with the word "poodle". "Lexical affinity" strategies use the occurrence of words such as "accident" to [[sentiment analysis|assess the sentiment]] of a document. Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, but continue to lack the semantic understanding required to classify isolated sentences well. Besides the usual difficulties with encoding semantic commonsense knowledge, existing semantic NLP sometimes scales too poorly to be viable in business applications. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of "narrative" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cambria|first1=Erik|last2=White|first2=Bebo|title=Jumping NLP Curves: A Review of Natural Language Processing Research [Review Article]|journal=IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine|date=May 2014|volume=9|issue=2|pages=48–57|doi=10.1109/MCI.2014.2307227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perception ===

{{Main|Machine perception|Computer vision|Speech recognition}}

[[File:Ääretuvastuse näide.png|thumb|[[Feature detection (computer vision)|Feature detection]] (pictured: [[edge detection]]) helps AI compose informative abstract structures out of raw data.]]

[[Machine perception]]&lt;ref name="Machine perception"/&gt; is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras (visible spectrum or infrared), microphones, wireless signals, and active [[lidar]], sonar, radar, and [[tactile sensor]]s) to deduce aspects of the world. Applications include [[speech recognition]],&lt;ref name="Speech recognition"/&gt; [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]], and [[object recognition]].&lt;ref name="Object recognition"/&gt; [[Computer vision]] is the ability to analyze visual input. Such input is usually ambiguous; a giant, fifty-meter-tall pedestrian far away may produce exactly the same pixels as a nearby normal-sized pedestrian, requiring the AI to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations, for example by using its "object model" to assess that fifty-meter pedestrians do not exist.&lt;ref name="Computer vision"/&gt;

=== Motion and manipulation ===
&lt;!-- This is linked to in the introduction --&gt;
{{Main|Robotics}}

AI is heavily used in [[robotics]].&lt;ref name="Robotics"/&gt; Advanced [[robotic arm]]s and other [[industrial robot]]s, widely used in modern factories, can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage.&lt;ref name="Configuration space"/&gt; A modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and [[robotic mapping|map]] its environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in [[endoscopy]]) the interior of a patient's breathing body, pose a greater challenge. [[Motion planning]] is the process of breaking down a movement task into "primitives" such as individual joint movements. Such movement often involves compliant motion, a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object.{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}&lt;ref name="Robotic mapping"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cadena|first1=Cesar|last2=Carlone|first2=Luca|last3=Carrillo|first3=Henry|last4=Latif|first4=Yasir|last5=Scaramuzza|first5=Davide|last6=Neira|first6=Jose|last7=Reid|first7=Ian|last8=Leonard|first8=John J.|title=Past, Present, and Future of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping: Toward the Robust-Perception Age|journal=IEEE Transactions on Robotics|date=December 2016|volume=32|issue=6|pages=1309–1332|doi=10.1109/TRO.2016.2624754}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moravec's paradox]] generalizes that low-level sensorimotor skills that humans take for granted are, counterintuitively, difficult to program into a robot; the paradox is named after [[Hans Moravec]], who stated in 1988 that "it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Hans | last = Moravec | year = 1988 | title = Mind Children | publisher = Harvard University Press | author-link =Hans Moravec| p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chan|first1=Szu Ping|title=This is what will happen when robots take over the world|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11994694/Heres-what-will-happen-when-robots-take-over-the-world.html|accessdate=23 April 2018|date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is attributed to the fact that, unlike checkers, physical dexterity has been a direct target of [[natural selection]] for millions of years.&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=IKEA furniture and the limits of AI|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21740735-humans-have-had-good-run-most-recent-breakthrough-robotics-it-clear|accessdate=24 April 2018|work=The Economist|date=2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long run, social skills and an understanding of human emotion and [[game theory]] would be valuable to a social agent. Being able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states would allow an agent to make better decisions. Some computer systems mimic human emotion and expressions to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate [[human–computer interaction]].&lt;ref name="Emotion and affective computing"/&gt; Similarly, some [[virtual assistant]]s are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Waddell|first1=Kaveh|title=Chatbots Have Entered the Uncanny Valley|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/uncanny-valley-digital-assistants/523806/|accessdate=24 April 2018|work=The Atlantic|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General intelligence ===

{{Main|Artificial general intelligence|AI-complete}}

Historically, projects such as the Cyc knowledge base (1984–) and the massive Japanese [[Fifth generation computer|Fifth Generation Computer Systems]] initiative (1982–1992) attempted to cover the breadth of human cognition. These early projects failed to escape the limitations of non-quantitative symbolic logic models and, in retrospect, greatly underestimated the difficulty of cross-domain AI. Nowadays, the vast majority of current AI researchers work instead on tractable "narrow AI" applications (such as medical diagnosis or automobile navigation).&lt;ref name="contemporary agi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pennachin|first1=C.|last2=Goertzel|first2=B.|title=Contemporary Approaches to Artificial General Intelligence|journal=Artificial General Intelligence.

The Pieces of the Puzzle Fall into Place}} Finally, a few "emergent" approaches look to simulating human intelligence extremely closely, and believe that [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] features like an [[artificial brain]] or simulated [[developmental robotics|child development]] may someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges.&lt;ref name="Brain simulation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goertzel|first1=Ben|last2=Lian|first2=Ruiting|last3=Arel|first3=Itamar|last4=de Garis|first4=Hugo|last5=Chen|first5=Shuo|title=A world survey of artificial brain projects, Part II: Biologically inspired cognitive architectures|journal=Neurocomputing|date=December 2010|volume=74|issue=1–3|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2010.08.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the problems in this article may also require general intelligence, if machines are to solve the problems as well as people do. For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like [[machine translation]], require that a machine read and write in both languages ([[#Natural language processing|NLP]]), follow the author's argument ([[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]), know what is being talked about ([[#Knowledge representation|knowledge]]), and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent ([[#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]). A problem like machine translation is considered "[[AI-complete]]", because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.

== Approaches ==
There is no established unifying theory or [[paradigm]] that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes: "Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about" {{Harv|Nilsson|1983|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying [[psychology]] or [[Neuroscience|neurobiology]]? Or is [[human biology]] as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to [[aeronautical engineering]]?&lt;ref name="Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general"/&gt;
Can intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as [[logic]] or [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]])? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?&lt;ref name="Neats vs. scruffies"/&gt;

=== Cybernetics and brain simulation ===
{{Main|Cybernetics|Computational neuroscience}}
In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between [[neurobiology]], [[information theory]], and [[cybernetics]]. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as [[W. Grey Walter]]'s [[turtle (robot)|turtles]] and the [[Johns Hopkins Beast]]. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Ratio Club]] in England.&lt;ref name="AI's immediate precursors"/&gt; By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.

=== Symbolic ===
{{Main|Symbolic AI}}
When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Stanford]] and [[MIT]], and as described below, each one developed its own style of research. [[John Haugeland]] named these symbolic approaches to AI "good old fashioned AI" or "[[GOFAI]]".&lt;ref name="GOFAI"/&gt; During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on [[cybernetics]] or [[artificial neural network]]s were abandoned or pushed into the background.&lt;ref&gt;The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of [[perceptron]]s by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] in 1969. See [[History of AI]], [[AI winter]], or [[Frank Rosenblatt]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with [[artificial general intelligence]] and considered this the goal of their field.

==== Cognitive simulation ====
Economist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as [[cognitive science]], [[operations research]] and [[management science]]. Their research team used the results of [[psychology|psychological]] experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] would eventually culminate in the development of the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] architecture in the middle 1980s.&lt;ref name="AI at CMU in the 60s"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soar"/&gt;

==== Logic-based ====
Unlike Simon and Newell, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem-solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.&lt;ref name="Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general"/&gt; His laboratory at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] ([[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|SAIL]]) focused on using formal [[logic]] to solve a wide variety of problems, including [[knowledge representation]], [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and [[machine learning|learning]].&lt;ref name="AI at Stanford in the 60s"/&gt; Logic was also the focus of the work at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language [[Prolog]] and the science of [[logic programming]].&lt;ref name="AI at Edinburgh and France in the 60s"/&gt;

==== Anti-logic or scruffy ====
Researchers at [[MIT]] (such as [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]])&lt;ref name="AI at MIT in the 60s"/&gt; found that solving difficult problems in [[computer vision|vision]] and [[natural language processing]] required ad-hoc solutions—they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like [[logic]]) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. [[Roger Schank]] described their "anti-logic" approaches as "[[Neats vs. scruffies|scruffy]]" (as opposed to the "[[neats vs. scruffies|neat]]" paradigms at [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] and Stanford).&lt;ref name="Neats vs. scruffies"/&gt; [[Commonsense knowledge bases]] (such as [[Doug Lenat]]'s [[Cyc]]) are an example of "scruffy" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.&lt;ref name="Cyc"/&gt;

====Knowledge-based====
When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build [[knowledge representation|knowledge]] into AI applications.&lt;ref name="Knowledge revolution"/&gt; This "knowledge revolution" led to the development and deployment of [[expert system]]s (introduced by [[Edward Feigenbaum]]), the first truly successful form of AI software.&lt;ref name="Expert systems"/&gt; Key component on system arhitecute for all expert systems is Knowledge base, which stores facts and rules that illustrates AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Frederick |first=Hayes-Roth |last2=William |first2=Murray |last3=Leonard |first3=Adelman |title=Expert systems |language=en |doi=10.1036/1097-8542.248550}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.

=== Sub-symbolic ===
By the 1980s, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially [[machine perception|perception]], [[robotics]], [[machine learning|learning]] and [[pattern recognition]]. A number of researchers began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches to specific AI problems.&lt;ref name="Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic"/&gt; Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.

==== Embodied intelligence ====
This includes [[embodied agent|embodied]], [[situated]], [[behavior-based AI|behavior-based]], and [[nouvelle AI]]. Researchers from the related field of [[robotics]], such as [[Rodney Brooks]], rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.&lt;ref name="Embodied AI"/&gt; Their work revived the non-symbolic viewpoint of the early [[cybernetic]]s researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of [[control theory]] in AI. This coincided with the development of the [[embodied mind thesis]] in the related field of [[cognitive science]]: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.

Within [[developmental robotics]], developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).{{sfn|Weng|McClelland|Pentland|Sporns|2001}}{{sfn|Lungarella|Metta|Pfeifer|Sandini|2003}}{{sfn|Asada|Hosoda|Kuniyoshi|Ishiguro|2009}}{{sfn|Oudeyer|2010}}

====Computational intelligence and soft computing====
Interest in [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and "[[connectionism]]" was revived by [[David Rumelhart]] and others in the middle of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Revival of connectionism"/&gt; [[Artificial neural network]]s are an example of [[soft computing]]—they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient. Other [[soft computing]] approaches to AI include [[fuzzy system]]s, [[evolutionary computation]] and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of [[computational intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Computational intelligence"/&gt;

=== Statistical learning ===
Much of traditional GOFAI got bogged down on ''ad hoc'' patches to symbolic computation that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. However, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMM), [[information theory]], and normative Bayesian [[decision theory]] to compare or to unify competing architectures. The shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like [[mathematics]], economics or [[operations research]]).{{efn|While such a "victory of the neats" may be a consequence of the field becoming more mature, [[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|AIMA]] states that in practice both [[neats and scruffies|neat and scruffy]] approaches continue to be necessary in AI research.}} Compared with GOFAI, new "statistical learning" techniques such as HMM and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as [[data mining]], without necessarily acquiring semantic understanding of the datasets. The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models; AI research was becoming more [[scientific method|scientific]]. Nowadays results of experiments are often rigorously measurable, and are sometimes (with difficulty) reproducible.&lt;ref name="Formal methods in AI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hutson|first1=Matthew|title=Artificial intelligence faces reproducibility crisis|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6377/725|accessdate=28 April 2018|work=[[Science Magazine|Science]]|date=16 February 2018|pages=725–726|language=en|doi=10.1126/science.359.6377.725|bibcode=2018Sci...359..725H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different statistical learning techniques have different limitations; for example, basic HMM cannot model the infinite possible combinations of natural language.{{sfn|Norvig|2012}} Critics note that the shift from GOFAI to statistical learning is often also a shift away from [[Explainable AI]]. In AGI research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into GOFAI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence.{{sfn|Langley|2011}}{{sfn|Katz|2012}}

=== Integrating the approaches ===
;Intelligent agent paradigm: An [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as [[firm]]s). The paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given "goal function". An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works—some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic [[artificial neural network]]s and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields—such as [[decision theory]] and economics—that also use concepts of abstract agents. Building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Intelligent agents"/&gt;

;[[Agent architecture]]s and [[cognitive architecture]]s: Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting [[intelligent agents]] in a [[multi-agent system]].&lt;ref name="Agent architectures"/&gt; A [[hierarchical control system]] provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling.&lt;ref name="Hierarchical control system"/&gt; Some cognitive architectures are custom-built to solve a narrow problem; others, such as [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]], are designed to mimic human cognition and to provide insight into general intelligence. Modern extensions of Soar are [[hybrid intelligent system]]s that include both symbolic and sub-symbolic components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laird|first1=John|title=Extending the Soar cognitive architecture|journal=Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications|date=2008|volume=171|page=224|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.77.2473&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lieto|first1=Antonio|last2=Bhatt|first2=Mehul|last3=Oltramari|first3=Alessandro|last4=Vernon|first4=David|title=The role of cognitive architectures in general artificial intelligence|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|date=May 2018|volume=48|pages=1–3|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in [[computer science]]. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.

=== Search and optimization ===

{{Main|Search algorithm|Mathematical optimization|Evolutionary computation}}

Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:&lt;ref name="Search"/&gt; [[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|Reasoning]] can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from [[premise]]s to [[Logical consequence|conclusions]], where each step is the application of an [[inference rule]].&lt;ref name="Logic as search"/&gt; [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning]] algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called [[means-ends analysis]].&lt;ref name="Planning as search"/&gt; [[Robotics]] algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use [[local search (optimization)|local searches]] in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]].&lt;ref name="Configuration space"/&gt; Many [[machine learning|learning]] algorithms use search algorithms based on [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].

Simple exhaustive searches&lt;ref name="Uninformed search"/&gt; are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the [[search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[Astronomically large|astronomical numbers]]. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use "[[heuristics]]" or "rules of thumb" that prioritize choices in favor of those that are more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices that are unlikely to lead to a goal (called "[[pruning (algorithm)|pruning]] the [[search tree]]"). [[Heuristics]] supply the program with a "best guess" for the path on which the solution lies.&lt;ref name="Informed search"/&gt; Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}

A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind [[hill climbing]]: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are [[simulated annealing]], [[beam search]] and [[random optimization]].&lt;ref name="Optimization search"/&gt;

[[File:ParticleSwarmArrowsAnimation.gif|thumb|A [[particle swarm optimization|particle swarm]] seeking the [[global minimum]]]]
[[Evolutionary computation]] uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, [[artificial selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic [[evolutionary algorithms]] include [[genetic algorithms]], [[gene expression programming]], and [[genetic programming]].&lt;ref name="Genetic programming"/&gt; Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via [[swarm intelligence]] algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are [[particle swarm optimization]] (inspired by bird [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]]) and [[ant colony optimization]] (inspired by [[ant trail]]s).&lt;ref name="Society based learning"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Merkle|author2=Martin Middendorf|editor1-last=Burke|editor1-first=Edmund K.|editor2-last=Kendall|editor2-first=Graham|title=Search Methodologies: Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support Techniques|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461469407|language=en|chapter=Swarm Intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logic ===

{{Main|Logic programming|Automated reasoning}}

[[Logic]]&lt;ref name="Logic"/&gt; is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the [[satplan]] algorithm uses logic for [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]]&lt;ref name="Satplan"/&gt; and [[inductive logic programming]] is a method for [[machine learning|learning]].&lt;ref name="Symbolic learning techniques"/&gt;

Several different forms of logic are used in AI research. [[Propositional logic]]&lt;ref name="Propositional logic"/&gt; involves [[truth function]]s such as "or" and "not". [[First-order logic]]&lt;ref name="First-order logic"/&gt; adds [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] and [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]], and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. [[Fuzzy set theory]] assigns a "degree of truth" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as "Alice is old" (or rich, or tall, or hungry) that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false. [[Fuzzy logic]] is successfully used in [[control system]]s to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as "if you are close to the destination station and moving fast, increase the train's brake pressure"; these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system. Fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases; many AI researchers question the validity of chaining fuzzy-logic inferences.{{efn|"There exist many different types of uncertainty, vagueness, and ignorance... [We] independently confirm the inadequacy of systems for reasoning about uncertainty that propagates numerical factors according to only to which connectives appear in assertions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elkin|first1=Charles|title=The paradoxical success of fuzzy logic|journal=IEEE expert|date=1994|volume=9|issue=4|pages=3–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Fuzzy logic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What is 'fuzzy logic'? Are there computers that are inherently fuzzy and do not apply the usual binary logic?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-fuzzy-logic-are-t/|accessdate=5 May 2018|work=Scientific American|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Default logic]]s, [[non-monotonic logic]]s and [[circumscription (logic)|circumscription]]&lt;ref name="Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic"/&gt; are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the [[qualification problem]]. Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of [[knowledge representation|knowledge]], such as: [[description logic]]s;&lt;ref name="Representing categories and relations"/&gt; [[situation calculus]], [[event calculus]] and [[fluent calculus]] (for representing events and time);&lt;ref name="Representing time"/&gt; [[Causality#Causal calculus|causal calculus]];&lt;ref name="Representing causation"/&gt; belief calculus;&lt;ref&gt;"The Belief Calculus and Uncertain Reasoning", Yen-Teh Hsia&lt;/ref&gt; and [[modal logic]]s.&lt;ref name="Representing knowledge about knowledge"/&gt;

Overall, qualitiative symbolic logic is brittle and scales poorly in the presence of [[noise (signal processing)|noise]] or other uncertainty. Exceptions to rules are numerous, and it is difficult for logical systems to function in the presence of contradictory rules.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=chapter 6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Logic and Probability|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/logic-probability/|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning ===

{{Main|Bayesian network|Hidden Markov model|Kalman filter|Particle filter|Decision theory|Utility theory}}
[[File:EM Clustering of Old Faithful data.gif|right|frame|[[Expectation-maximization]] clustering of [[Old Faithful]] eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption.]]

Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from [[probability]] theory and economics.&lt;ref name="Stochastic methods for uncertain reasoning"/&gt;

[[Bayesian network]]s&lt;ref name="Bayesian networks"/&gt; are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the [[Bayesian inference]] algorithm),&lt;ref name="Bayesian inference"/&gt; [[Machine learning|learning]] (using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]),{{efn|Expectation-maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown [[latent variables]]{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=210}}}}&lt;ref name="Bayesian learning"/&gt; [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] (using [[decision network]]s)&lt;ref name="Bayesian decision networks"/&gt; and [[machine perception|perception]] (using [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s).&lt;ref name="Stochastic temporal models"/&gt; Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping [[machine perception|perception]] systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., [[hidden Markov model]]s or [[Kalman filter]]s).&lt;ref name="Stochastic temporal models"/&gt; Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be [[conditionally independent]] of one another. Complicated graphs with diamonds or other "loops" (undirected [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]) can require a sophisticated method such as [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]], which spreads an ensemble of [[random walk]]ers throughout the Bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities. Bayesian networks are used on [[Xbox Live]] to rate and match players; wins and losses are "evidence" of how good a player is. [[AdSense]] uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=chapter 6}}

A key concept from the science of economics is "[[utility]]": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using [[decision theory]], [[decision analysis]],&lt;ref name="Decisions theory and analysis"/&gt; and [[applied information economics|information value theory]].&lt;ref name="Information value theory"/&gt; These tools include models such as [[Markov decision process]]es,&lt;ref name="Markov decision process"/&gt; dynamic [[decision network]]s,&lt;ref name="Stochastic temporal models"/&gt; [[game theory]] and [[mechanism design]].&lt;ref name="Game theory and mechanism design"/&gt;

=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===

{{Main|Classifier (mathematics)|Statistical classification|Machine learning}}

The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers ("if shiny then diamond") and controllers ("if shiny then pick up"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]] are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.&lt;ref name="Classifiers"/&gt;

A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and [[machine learning]] approaches. The [[decision tree learning|decision tree]]&lt;ref name="Decision tree"/&gt; is perhaps the most widely used machine learning algorithm.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=88}} Other widely used classifiers are the [[Artificial neural network|neural network]],&lt;ref name="Neural networks"/&gt;
[[k-nearest neighbor algorithm]],{{efn|The most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=187}}}}&lt;ref name="K-nearest neighbor algorithm"/&gt;
[[kernel methods]] such as the [[support vector machine]] (SVM),{{efn|SVM displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=188}}}}&lt;ref name="Kernel methods"/&gt;
[[Gaussian mixture model]],&lt;ref name="Gaussian mixture model"/&gt; and the extremely popular [[naive Bayes classifier]].{{efn|Naive Bayes is reportedly the "most widely used learner" at Google, due in part to its scalability.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=152}}}}&lt;ref name="Naive Bayes classifier"/&gt; Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, the dimensionality, and the level of noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as "naive Bayes" on most practical data sets.&lt;ref name="Classifier performance"/&gt;{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|loc=18.12: Learning from Examples: Summary}}

=== Artificial neural networks ===

{{Main|Artificial neural network|Connectionism}}
[[File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]

Neural networks, or neural nets, were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple "neuron" ''N'' accepts input from multiple other neurons, each of which, when activated (or "fired"), cast a weighted "vote" for or against whether neuron ''N'' should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed "[[Hebbian learning|fire together, wire together]]") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The net forms "concepts" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared{{efn|Each individual neuron is likely to participate in more than one concept.}} neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning "leg" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning "foot" that includes the sound for "foot". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural nets can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations. Neural networks' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car.{{efn|Steering for the 1995 "[[History of autonomous cars#1990s|No Hands Across America]]" required "only a few human assists".}}{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 4}} In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related [[mergers and acquisitions|M&amp;A]] in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Deep Learning Is Suddenly Changing Your Life|url=http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=Fortune|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google leads in the race to dominate artificial intelligence|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21732125-tech-giants-are-investing-billions-transformative-technology-google-leads-race|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=The Economist|date=2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of non-learning [[artificial neural network]]s&lt;ref name="Neural networks"/&gt; began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of [[Walter Pitts]] and [[Warren McCullouch]]. [[Frank Rosenblatt]] invented the [[perceptron]], a learning network with a single layer, similar to the old concept of [[linear regression]]. Early pioneers also include [[Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko]], [[Teuvo Kohonen]], [[Stephen Grossberg]], [[Kunihiko Fukushima]], Christoph von der Malsburg, David Willshaw, [[Shun-Ichi Amari]], [[Bernard Widrow]], [[John Hopfield]], [[Eduardo R. Caianiello]], and others.

The main categories of networks are acyclic or [[feedforward neural network]]s (where the signal passes in only one direction) and [[recurrent neural network]]s (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events). Among the most popular feedforward networks are [[perceptron]]s, [[multi-layer perceptron]]s and [[radial basis network]]s.&lt;ref name="Feedforward neural networks"/&gt; Neural networks can be applied to the problem of [[intelligent control]] (for robotics) or [[machine learning|learning]], using such techniques as [[Hebbian learning]] ("fire together, wire together"), [[GMDH]] or [[competitive learning]].&lt;ref name="Learning in neural networks"/&gt;

Today, neural networks are often trained by the [[backpropagation]] algorithm, which had been around since 1970 as the reverse mode of [[automatic differentiation]] published by [[Seppo Linnainmaa]],&lt;ref name="lin1970"&gt;[[Seppo Linnainmaa]] (1970). The representation of the cumulative rounding error of an algorithm as a Taylor expansion of the local rounding errors. Master's Thesis (in Finnish), Univ.

Optimization Stories, Documenta Matematica, Extra Volume ISMP (2012), 389–400.&lt;/ref&gt; and was introduced to neural networks by [[Paul Werbos]].&lt;ref name="WERBOS1974"&gt;[[Paul Werbos]], "Beyond Regression: New Tools for Prediction and Analysis in the Behavioral Sciences", ''PhD thesis, Harvard University'', 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="werbos1982"&gt;[[Paul Werbos]] (1982).

[[Hierarchical temporal memory]] is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the [[neocortex]].&lt;ref name="Hierarchical temporal memory"/&gt;

In short, most neural networks use some form of [[gradient descent]] on a hand-created neural topology. However, some research groups, such as [[Uber]], argue that simple [[neuroevolution]] to mutate new neural network topologies and weights may be competitive with sophisticated gradient descent approaches. One advantage of neuroevolution is that it may be less prone to get caught in "dead ends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Artificial intelligence can 'evolve' to solve problems|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/01/artificial-intelligence-can-evolve-solve-problems|accessdate=7 February 2018|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|date=10 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Deep feedforward neural networks ====

{{Main|Deep learning}}

[[Deep learning]] is any [[artificial neural network]] that can learn a long chain of causal links. For example, a feedforward network with six hidden layers can learn a seven-link causal chain (six hidden layers + output layer) and has a [[deep learning#Credit assignment|"credit assignment path"]] (CAP) depth of seven. Many deep learning systems need to be able to learn chains ten or more causal links in length.&lt;ref name="schmidhuber2015"/&gt; Deep learning has transformed many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including [[computer vision]], [[speech recognition]], [[natural language processing]] and others.&lt;ref name="goodfellow2016"&gt;Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville (2016).

In 2006, a publication by [[Geoffrey Hinton]] and Ruslan Salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre-training many-layered [[feedforward neural network]]s (FNNs) one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] [[restricted Boltzmann machine]], then using [[supervised learning|supervised]] [[backpropagation]] for fine-tuning.{{sfn|Hinton|2007}} Similar to shallow artificial neural networks, deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships.

Deep learning often uses [[convolutional neural network]]s (CNNs), whose origins can be traced back to the [[Neocognitron]] introduced by [[Kunihiko Fukushima]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="FUKU1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fukushima | first1 = K. | year = 1980 | title = Neocognitron: A self-organizing neural network model for a mechanism of pattern recognition unaffected by shift in position | url = | journal = Biological Cybernetics | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 193–202 | doi=10.1007/bf00344251 | pmid=7370364}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, [[Yann LeCun]] and colleagues applied [[backpropagation]] to such an architecture. In the early 2000s, in an industrial application CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US.&lt;ref name="lecun2016slides"&gt;[[Yann LeCun]] (2016).

Since 2011, fast implementations of CNNs on GPUs have
won many visual pattern recognition competitions.&lt;ref name="schmidhuber2015"/&gt;

==== Deep recurrent neural networks ====

{{Main|Recurrent neural networks}}

Early on, deep learning was also applied to sequence learning with [[recurrent neural networks]] (RNNs)&lt;ref name="Recurrent neural networks"/&gt; which are in theory Turing complete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyötyniemi|first1=Heikki|title=Turing machines are recurrent neural networks|journal=Proceedings of STeP '96/Publications of the Finnish Artificial Intelligence Society|pages=13–24|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. The depth of an RNN is unlimited and depends on the length of its input sequence; thus, an RNN is an example of deep learning.&lt;ref name="schmidhuber2015"/&gt; RNNs can be trained by [[gradient descent]]&lt;ref&gt;P.

The "imitation game" (an interpretation of the 1950 [[Turing test]] that assesses whether a computer can imitate a human) is nowadays considered too exploitable to be a meaningful benchmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoenick|first1=Carissa|last2=Clark|first2=Peter|last3=Tafjord|first3=Oyvind|last4=Turney|first4=Peter|last5=Etzioni|first5=Oren|title=Moving beyond the Turing Test with the Allen AI Science Challenge|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=23 August 2017|volume=60|issue=9|pages=60–64|doi=10.1145/3122814}}&lt;/ref&gt; A derivative of the Turing test is the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart ([[CAPTCHA]]). As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.{{sfn|O'Brien|Marakas|2011}}

Proposed "universal intelligence" tests aim to compare how well machines, humans, and even non-human animals perform on problem sets that are generic as possible. At an extreme, the test suite can contain every possible problem, weighted by [[Kolmogorov complexity]]; unfortunately, these problem sets tend to be dominated by impoverished pattern-matching exercises where a tuned AI can easily exceed human performance levels.&lt;ref name="Mathematical definitions of intelligence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hernández-Orallo|first1=José|last2=Dowe|first2=David L.|last3=Hernández-Lloreda|first3=M.Victoria|title=Universal psychometrics: Measuring cognitive abilities in the machine kingdom|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|date=March 2014|volume=27|pages=50–74|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2013.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Applications of artificial intelligence}}

AI is relevant to any intellectual task.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|p=1}} Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the [[AI effect]].{{sfn|''CNN''|2006}}

High-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] and [[self-driving cars]]), medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as [[Google search]]), online assistants (such as [[Siri]]), image recognition in photographs, spam filtering, predicting flight delays&lt;ref&gt;[https://ishti.org/2018/11/19/using-artificial-intelligence-to-predict-flight-delays/ Using AI to predict flight delays], Ishti.org.&lt;/ref&gt;, prediction of judicial decisions&lt;ref name="ecthr2016"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=N.

=== Healthcare ===
{{Main|Artificial intelligence in healthcare}}
[[File:Laproscopic Surgery Robot.jpg|thumb| A patient-side surgical arm of [[Da Vinci Surgical System]]]]AI is being applied to the high cost problem of dosage issues—where findings suggested that AI could save $16 billion.

Artificial intelligence is breaking into the healthcare industry by assisting doctors. According to Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Dina Bass | title=Microsoft Develops AI to Help Cancer Doctors Find the Right Treatments | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-20/microsoft-develops-ai-to-help-cancer-doctors-find-the-right-treatments | date=20 September 2016 | publisher=Bloomberg | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511103625/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-20/microsoft-develops-ai-to-help-cancer-doctors-find-the-right-treatments | archivedate=11 May 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer. In detail, there are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer. This negatively affects the doctors, because there are too many options to choose from, making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for the patients. Microsoft is working on a project to develop a machine called "Hanover". Its goal is to memorize all the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient. One project that is being worked on at the moment is fighting [[acute myeloid leukemia|myeloid leukemia]], a fatal cancer where the treatment has not improved in decades. Another study was reported to have found that artificial intelligence was as good as trained doctors in identifying skin cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38717928|title=Artificial intelligence 'as good as cancer doctors'|last=Gallagher|first=James|date=26 January 2017|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=26 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126133849/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38717928|archivedate=26 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study is using artificial intelligence to try and monitor multiple high-risk patients, and this is done by asking each patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Remote monitoring of high-risk patients using artificial intelligence|date=18 Oct 1994|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US5357427|editor-last=Langen|editor2-last=Katz|editor3-last=Dempsey|editor-first=Pauline A.|editor2-first=Jeffrey S.|editor3-first=Gayle|issue=US5357427 A|accessdate=27 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228090520/https://www.google.com/patents/US5357427|archivedate=28 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[CNN]], a recent study by surgeons at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington successfully demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot.

In the field of mental health care, artificial intelligence can be used to improve the diagnosis efficiency and helpfulness with patients. A study done in 2012 showed the use of an classification model that was built to shorten the 91-part Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) that is used to identify autism disorder through behavior &lt;ref&gt;Wall, D. P., Dally, R., Luyster, R., Jung, J.-Y., &amp; DeLuca, T. F. (2012). Use of Artificial Intelligence to Shorten the Behavioral Diagnosis of Autism. PLOS ONE, 7(8), e43855. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0043855&lt;/ref&gt;. Through their analysis of the data from the Autism Genomic Resource Exchange (AGRE), they were able to build a decision tree classifier that contained only 7 questions, and was able to identify autism with the 99.7% of the same accuracy as the 91-part ADI-R examination. Not only can artificial intelligence streamline the process, but an entirely artificially intelligent diagnosis system could potentially have a greater reach in clients and cater better to their needs. In fact, initial studies show that patients would be more comfortable with disclosing information to virtual humans rather than medical staff because virtual humans are able to spend more time with patients, are always friendly, and do not make the patient feel rushed &lt;ref&gt;Bickmore, T. W., Mitchell, S. E., Jack, B. W., Paasche-Orlow, M. K., Pfeifer, L. M., O’Donnel, J. (2010). Response to a relational agent by hospital patients with depressive symptoms | Interacting with Computers | Oxford Academic. (n.d.). &lt;/ref&gt;.  

In trauma cases, artificial intelligence has found it’s role in alternative or supplemental treatment methods. A great example is the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as a form of trauma therapy. While VR is not the artificial intelligence we often think of when we think of AI, many involve response learning techniques, movement and gesture recognition, and many techniques implemented in even some of the most complex artificial intelligence technologies. A study done by Albert Rizzo et. al (2011) highlights the uses of VR to prevent and treat combat-related PTSD symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, A., Parsons, T. D., Lange, B., Kenny, P., Buckwalter, J. G., Rothbaum, B., … Reger, G. (2011). Virtual Reality Goes to War: A Brief Review of the Future of Military Behavioral Healthcare. Journal of Clinical Psychology in Medical Settings, 18(2), 176–187. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10880-011-9247-2&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, Rizzo and company tested a sample of 20 individuals who measured above a 50 on a pre-treatment baseline score examination. Through an 11 week, 11-step treatment regimen using Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET), they were able to significantly reduce scores on the same two tests. Mean scores on the Beck Anxiety test went down from a mean score of about 19 to 12 post-treatment, and down to 7 after a 3 month follow up. Similarly, patient’s mean scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-Depression (PHQ-Depression) went from about 13, to 7.5 post treatment, and down to 5.5 after a 3 month follow up.

=== Automotive ===
{{Main|driverless cars}}
Advancements in AI have contributed to the growth of the automotive industry through the creation and evolution of self-driving vehicles. {{as of|2016}}, there are over 30 companies utilizing AI into the creation of [[driverless cars]]. A few companies involved with AI include [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]], [[Google]], and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].&lt;ref&gt;"33 Corporations Working On Autonomous Vehicles". CB Insights. N.p., 11 August 2016. 12 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many components contribute to the functioning of self-driving cars. These vehicles incorporate systems such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and mapping. Together, these systems, as well as high performance computers, are integrated into one complex vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;West, Darrell M. "Moving forward: Self-driving vehicles in China, Europe, Japan, Korea, and the United States". Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings. N.p., September 2016. 12 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent developments in autonomous automobiles have made the innovation of self-driving trucks possible, though they are still in the testing phase. The UK government has passed legislation to begin testing of self-driving truck platoons in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burgess|first1=Matt|title=The UK is about to Start Testing Self-Driving Truck Platoons|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-trial-self-driving-trucks-platoons-roads|website=WIRED|accessdate=20 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922055917/http://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-trial-self-driving-trucks-platoons-roads|archivedate=22 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-driving truck platoons are a fleet of self-driving trucks following the lead of one non-self-driving truck, so the truck platoons aren't entirely autonomous yet. Meanwhile, the Daimler, a German automobile corporation, is testing the Freightliner Inspiration which is a semi-autonomous truck that will only be used on the highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Alex|title=World's First Self-Driving Semi-Truck Hits the Road|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/worlds-first-self-driving-semi-truck-hits-road/|website=WIRED|accessdate=20 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028222802/https://www.wired.com/2015/05/worlds-first-self-driving-semi-truck-hits-road/|archivedate=28 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One main factor that influences the ability for a driver-less automobile to function is mapping. In general, the vehicle would be pre-programmed with a map of the area being driven. This map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings. However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, Matt. "Google's artificial intelligence breakthrough may have a huge impact on self-driving cars and much more". ''The Washington Post'' 25 February 2015. Infotrac Newsstand. 24 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Some self-driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brake pedals, so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions.&lt;ref&gt;"Programming safety into self-driving cars". National Science Foundation. N.p., 2 February 2015. 24 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor that is influencing the ability for a driver-less automobile is the safety of the passenger.  To make a driver-less automobile, engineers must program it to handle high-risk situations. These situations could include a head-on collision with pedestrians.  The car's main goal should be to make a decision that would avoid hitting the pedestrians and saving the passengers in the car.  But there is a possibility the car would need to make a decision that would put someone in danger. In other words, the car would need to decide to save the pedestrians or the passengers.&lt;ref&gt;ArXiv, E. T. (26 October 2015). Why Self-Driving Cars Must Be Programmed to Kill. Retrieved 17 November 2017, from https://www.technologyreview.com/s/542626/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/&lt;/ref&gt; The programming of the car in these situations is crucial to a successful driver-less automobile.

=== Finance and economics ===
[[Financial institution]]s have long used [[artificial neural network]] systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI in [[banking]] can be traced back to 1987 when [[Security Pacific National Bank]] in US set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the unauthorised use of debit cards. Programs like Kasisto and Moneystream are using AI in financial services.

Banks use artificial intelligence systems today to organize operations, maintain book-keeping, invest in stocks, and manage properties. AI can react to changes overnight or when business is not taking place.&lt;ref name="Eleanor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icas.com/ca-today-news/how-accountancy-and-finance-are-using-artificial-intelligence|title=Accounting, automation and AI|first=Eleanor|last=O'Neill,|website=www.icas.com|language=English|date=31 July 2016|access-date=18 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118165901/https://www.icas.com/ca-today-news/how-accountancy-and-finance-are-using-artificial-intelligence|archivedate=18 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2001, robots beat humans in a simulated [[stock trader|financial trading]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1481339.stm Robots Beat Humans in Trading Battle.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909001249/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1481339.stm |date=9 September 2009 }} BBC.com (8 August 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; AI has also reduced fraud and financial crimes by monitoring [[behavioral pattern]]s of users for any abnormal changes or anomalies.&lt;ref name="fsroundtable.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fsroundtable.org/cto-corner-artificial-intelligence-use-in-financial-services/|title=CTO Corner: Artificial Intelligence Use in Financial Services – Financial Services Roundtable|date=2 April 2015|newspaper=Financial Services Roundtable|language=en-US|access-date=18 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118165842/http://fsroundtable.org/cto-corner-artificial-intelligence-use-in-financial-services/|archivedate=18 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of AI machines in the market in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marwala |first1= Tshilidzi| last2=Hurwitz |first2= Evan |title=Artificial Intelligence and Economic Theory: Skynet in the Market |year=2017 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location=London |isbn=978-3-319-66104-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, AI based buying and selling platforms have changed the law of [[supply and demand]] in that it is now possible to easily estimate individualized demand and supply curves and thus individualized pricing. Furthermore, AI machines reduce [[information asymmetry]] in the market and thus making markets more efficient while reducing the volume of trades. Furthermore, AI in the markets limits the consequences of behavior in the markets again making markets more efficient. Other theories where AI has had impact include in [[rational choice]], [[rational expectations]], [[game theory]], [[Lewis turning point]], [[portfolio optimization]] and [[counterfactual thinking]].

=== Video games ===
{{Main|Artificial intelligence (video games)}}
In video games, artificial intelligence is routinely used to generate dynamic purposeful behavior in [[non-player character]]s (NPCs). In addition, well-understood AI techniques are routinely used for [[pathfinding]]. Some researchers consider NPC AI in games to be a "solved problem" for most production tasks. Games with more atypical AI include the AI director of ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' (2008) and the neuroevolutionary training of platoons in ''[[Supreme Commander 2]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21721890-games-help-them-understand-reality-why-ai-researchers-video-games|title=Why AI researchers like video games|website=The Economist|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005051028/https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21721890-games-help-them-understand-reality-why-ai-researchers-video-games|archivedate=5 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yannakakis, G.

== Philosophy and ethics ==
{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence|Ethics of artificial intelligence}}
There are three philosophical questions related to AI:
# Is [[artificial general intelligence]] possible? Can a machine solve any problem that a human being can solve using intelligence? Or are there hard limits to what a machine can accomplish?
# Are intelligent machines dangerous? How can we ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically?
# Can a machine have a [[mind]], [[consciousness]] and [[philosophy of mind|mental states]] in exactly the same sense that human beings do? Can a machine be [[Sentience|sentient]], and thus deserve certain rights? Can a machine [[intention]]ally cause harm?

=== The limits of artificial general intelligence ===
{{Main|Philosophy of AI|Turing test|Physical symbol systems hypothesis|Dreyfus' critique of AI|The Emperor's New Mind|AI effect}}

Can a machine be intelligent? Can it "think"?

;''[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence|Alan Turing's "polite convention"]]'': We need not decide if a machine can "think"; we need only decide if a machine can act as intelligently as a human being. This approach to the philosophical problems associated with artificial intelligence forms the basis of the [[Turing test]].&lt;ref name="Turing test"/&gt;

;''The [[Dartmouth Workshop|Dartmouth proposal]]'': "Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." This conjecture was printed in the proposal for the Dartmouth Conference of 1956, and represents the position of most working AI researchers.&lt;ref name="Dartmouth proposal"/&gt;

;''[[Physical symbol system|Newell and Simon's physical symbol system hypothesis]]'': "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action." Newell and Simon argue that intelligence consists of formal operations on symbols.&lt;ref name="Physical symbol system hypothesis"/&gt; [[Hubert Dreyfus]] argued that, on the contrary, human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a "feel" for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. (See [[Dreyfus' critique of AI]].)&lt;ref&gt;
Dreyfus criticized the [[necessary and sufficient|necessary]] condition of the [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis, which he called the "psychological assumption": "The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules." {{Harv|Dreyfus|1992|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreyfus' critique"/&gt;

;''Gödelian arguments'': [[Gödel]] himself,&lt;ref name="Gödel himself"/&gt; [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] (in 1961) and [[Roger Penrose]] (in a more detailed argument from 1989 onwards) made highly technical arguments that human mathematicians can consistently see the truth of their own "Gödel statements" and therefore have computational abilities beyond that of mechanical Turing machines.&lt;ref name="The mathematical objection"/&gt; However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that these "Gödelian arguments" fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Graham Oppy]]|title=Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#GdeArgAgaMec|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=20 January 2015|quote=These Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however, problematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stuart J. Russell]]|author2=[[Peter Norvig]]|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2010|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-604259-7|edition=3rd|chapter=26.1.2: Philosophical Foundations/Weak AI: Can Machines Act Intelligently?/The mathematical objection|quote=...even if we grant that computers have limitations on what they can prove, there is no evidence that humans are immune from those limitations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Colyvan. An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of Gödel's incompleteness results': "The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail."&lt;/ref&gt;

;''The [[artificial brain]] argument'': The brain can be simulated by machines and because brains are intelligent, simulated brains must also be intelligent; thus machines can be intelligent. [[Hans Moravec]], [[Ray Kurzweil]] and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original.&lt;ref name="Brain simulation"/&gt;

;''The [[AI effect]]'': Machines are ''already'' intelligent, but observers have failed to recognize it. When [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] beat [[Garry Kasparov]] in chess, the machine was acting intelligently. However, onlookers commonly discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not "real" intelligence after all; thus "real" intelligence is whatever intelligent behavior people can do that machines still cannot. This is known as the AI Effect: "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet."&lt;!--&lt;ref name="AI Effect"/&gt;--&gt;

=== Potential harm ===
Widespread use of artificial intelligence could have [[unintended consequences]] that are dangerous or undesirable. Scientists from the [[Future of Life Institute]], among others, described some short-term research goals to see how AI influences the economy, the laws and ethics that are involved with AI and how to minimize AI security risks. In the long-term, the scientists have proposed to continue optimizing function while minimizing possible security risks that come along with new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Russel, Stuart., Daniel Dewey, and Max Tegmark.

==== Existential risk ====
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}

Physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]], and [[SpaceX]] founder [[Elon Musk]] have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could evolve to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could "[[Global catastrophic risk|spell the end of the human race]]".

In his book ''[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|Superintelligence]]'', [[Nick Bostrom]] provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to mankind. He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit [[Instrumental convergence|convergent]] behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not reflect humanity's—one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible—it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.

Concern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some high-profile donations and investments. A group of prominent tech titans including [[Peter Thiel]], Amazon Web Services and Musk have committed $1billion to [[OpenAI]], a nonprofit company aimed at championing responsible AI development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-tech-titans-against-terminators-20151214-story.html|title=Tech titans like Elon Musk are spending $1 billion to save you from terminators|first=Washington|last=Post|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607121118/http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-tech-titans-against-terminators-20151214-story.html|archivedate=7 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly-capable AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The goal of the institute is to "grow wisdom with which we manage" the growing power of technology.

==== Devaluation of humanity ====
{{Main|Computer Power and Human Reason}}
[[Joseph Weizenbaum]] wrote that AI applications cannot, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as [[customer service]] or [[psychotherapy]]&lt;ref&gt;In the early 1970s, [[Kenneth Colby]] presented a version of Weizenbaum's [[ELIZA]] known as DOCTOR which he promoted as a serious therapeutic tool. {{Harv|Crevier|1993|pp=132–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; was deeply misguided. Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position is now known as [[computationalism]]). To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life.&lt;ref name="Weizenbaum's critique"/&gt;

==== Decrease in demand for human labor ====
{{Further|Technological unemployment#21st century}}
The relationship between automation and employment is complicated. While automation eliminates old jobs, it also creates new jobs through micro-economic and macro-economic effects.&lt;ref&gt;E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(3)]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; ''[[The Economist]]'' states that "the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution" is "worth taking seriously".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Automation and anxiety|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21700758-will-smarter-machines-cause-mass-unemployment-automation-and-anxiety|accessdate=13 January 2018|work=The Economist|date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective estimates of the risk vary widely; for example, Michael Osborne and [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] estimate 47% of U.S. jobs are at "high risk" of potential automation, while an OECD report classifies only 9% of U.S.&lt;!-- see report p. 33 table 4; 9% is both the OECD average and the US average --&gt; jobs as "high risk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lohr|first1=Steve|title=Robots Will Take Jobs, but Not as Fast as Some Fear, New Report Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/technology/robots-will-take-jobs-but-not-as-fast-as-some-fear-new-report-says.html|accessdate=13 January 2018|work=The New York Times|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1 January 2017|title=The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162516302244|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=114|pages=254–280|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019|issn=0040-1625|last1=Frey|first1=Carl Benedikt|last2=Osborne|first2=Michael A|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arntz, Melanie, Terry Gregory, and Ulrich Zierahn.

==== Autonomous weapons ====
{{See also|Lethal autonomous weapon}}
Currently, 50+ countries are researching battlefield robots, including the United States, China, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Many people concerned about risk from superintelligent AI also want to limit the use of artificial soldiers and drones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates Warn About Artificial Intelligence|url = http://observer.com/2015/08/stephen-hawking-elon-musk-and-bill-gates-warn-about-artificial-intelligence/|website = Observer|accessdate = 30 October 2015|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151030053323/http://observer.com/2015/08/stephen-hawking-elon-musk-and-bill-gates-warn-about-artificial-intelligence/|archivedate = 30 October 2015|df = dmy-all|date = 2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical machines ===
Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to prevent harm and minimize the risks; they may have the ability to use [[ethics|ethical reasoning]] to better choose their actions in the world. Research in this area includes [[machine ethics]], [[artificial moral agents]], and [[friendly AI]].

==== Artificial moral agents ====
Wendell Wallach introduced the concept of [[artificial moral agents]] (AMA) in his book ''Moral Machines''&lt;ref&gt;Wendell Wallach (2010). ''Moral Machines'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For Wallach, AMAs have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as "Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions"&lt;ref&gt;Wallach, pp 37–54.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Can (Ro)bots Really Be Moral".&lt;ref&gt;Wallach, pp 55–73.&lt;/ref&gt; For Wallach the question is not centered on the issue of ''whether'' machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the ''constraints'' which society may place on the development of AMAs.&lt;ref&gt;Wallach, Introduction chapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Machine ethics ====
{{Main|Machine ethics}}
The field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Michael Anderson and Susan Leigh Anderson (2011), Machine Ethics, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: "Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |title=Machine Ethics |work=aaai.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129044821/http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |archivedate=29 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition "Machine Ethics"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==== Malevolent and friendly AI ====
{{Main|Friendly AI}}
Political scientist [[Charles T. Rubin]] believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles T. Rubin |date=Spring 2003 |title=Artificial Intelligence and Human Nature &amp;#124;`The New Atlantis |volume=1 |pages=88–100 |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611115223/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |archivedate=11 June 2012 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence." Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no ''a priori'' reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.

One proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is '[[Friendly AI]]', and will then be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could really remain in place.

Leading AI researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] writes, "I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI, and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=artificial intelligence is a tool, not a threat|date=10 November 2014|url=http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112130954/http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|archivedate=12 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===
{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}
If an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be [[Sentience|sentient]]—will it have a [[mind]] which has [[consciousness|conscious experiences]]? This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].

[[David Chalmers]] identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the "hard" and "easy" problems of consciousness.&lt;ref name=Chalmers&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |title=Facing up to the problem of consciousness |last=Chalmers |first=David |authorlink=David Chalmers |journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] |volume= 2 |issue=3 |year=1995 |pages=200–219}} See also [http://consc.net/papers/facing.html this link]
&lt;/ref&gt; The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this ''feels'' or why it should feel like anything at all. Human [[information processing]] is easy to explain, however human [[subjective experience]] is difficult to explain.

For example, consider what happens when a person is shown a color swatch and identifies it, saying "it's red". The easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red. The hard problem is that people also know something else—they also know ''what red looks like''. (Consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks like.){{efn|This is based on [[Mary's Room]], a thought experiment first proposed by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] in 1982}} Everyone knows subjective experience exists, because they do it every day (e.g., all sighted people know what red looks like). The hard problem is explaining how the brain creates it, why it exists, and how it is different than knowledge and other aspects of the brain.

==== Computationalism and functionalism ====
{{Main|Computationalism|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}
Computationalism is the position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Horst|Horst, Steven]], (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ "The Computational Theory of Mind"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [[mind-body problem]]. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].

==== Strong AI hypothesis ====
{{Main|Chinese room}}
The philosophical position that John Searle has named [[strong AI hypothesis|"strong AI"]] states: "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."&lt;ref name="Searle's strong AI"/&gt; Searle counters this assertion with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which asks us to look ''inside'' the computer and try to find where the "mind" might be.&lt;ref name="Chinese room"/&gt;

==== Robot rights ====
{{Main|Robot rights}}
If a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also ''[[sentience|feel]]''? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? This issue, now known as "[[robot rights]]", is currently being considered by, for example, California's [[Institute for the Future]], although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.&lt;ref name="Robot rights"/&gt; Some critics of [[transhumanism]] argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with [[animal rights]] and human rights.&lt;ref Name="Evans 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last = Evans | first = Woody | authorlink = Woody Evans | title = Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds | work = Teknokultura | publisher = Universidad Complutense, Madrid | date = 2015 | url = http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/TEKN/article/view/49072/46310 | accessdate = 5 December 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161228094440/http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/TEKN/article/view/49072/46310 | archivedate = 28 December 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film ''[[Plug &amp; Pray]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|title=Content: Plug &amp; Pray Film – Artificial Intelligence – Robots -|author=maschafilm|work=plugandpray-film.de|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212040134/http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|archivedate=12 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superintelligence ===
{{Main|Superintelligence}}
Are there limits to how intelligent machines—or human-machine hybrids—can be? A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. ‘’Superintelligence’’ may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt;

==== Technological singularity ====
{{Main|Technological singularity|Moore's law}}
If research into [[artificial general intelligence|Strong AI]] produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to [[Intelligence explosion|recursive self-improvement]].&lt;ref name="recurse"/&gt; The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer [[Vernor Vinge]] named this scenario "[[technological singularity|singularity]]".&lt;ref name=Singularity/&gt; Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.&lt;ref name=Singularity/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt;

[[Ray Kurzweil]] has used [[Moore's law]] (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that [[desktop computer]]s will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029, and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045.&lt;ref name=Singularity/&gt;

==== Transhumanism ====
{{Main|Transhumanism}}
{{quote|You awake one morning to find your brain has another lobe functioning. Invisible, this auxiliary lobe answers your questions with information beyond the realm of your own memory, suggests plausible courses of action, and asks questions that help bring out relevant facts. You quickly come to rely on the new lobe so much that you stop wondering how it works. You just use it. This is the dream of artificial intelligence.|''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'', April 1985&lt;ref name="lemmon198504"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-04/1985_04_BYTE_10-04_Artificial_Intelligence#page/n125/mode/2up | title=Artificial Intelligence | work=BYTE | date=April 1985 | accessdate=14 February 2015 | author=Lemmons, Phil | page=125 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420115129/https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-04/1985_04_BYTE_10-04_Artificial_Intelligence#page/n125/mode/2up | archivedate=20 April 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Robot designer [[Hans Moravec]], cyberneticist [[Kevin Warwick]] and inventor [[Ray Kurzweil]] have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into [[cyborg]]s that are more capable and powerful than either.&lt;ref name="Transhumanism"/&gt; This idea, called [[transhumanism]], which has roots in [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Robert Ettinger]].

[[Edward Fredkin]] argues that "artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution", an idea first proposed by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s "[[Darwin among the Machines]]" (1863), and expanded upon by [[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] in his book of the same name in 1998.&lt;ref name="AI as evolution"/&gt;

== In fiction ==
{{Main|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}
[[File:Capek play.jpg|thumb|The word "robot" itself was coined by [[Karel Čapek]] in his 1921 play ''[[R.U.R.]]'', the title standing for "[[Rossum's Universal Robots]]"]]

Thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,&lt;ref name="AI in myth"/&gt;
and have been a persistent theme in [[science fiction]].

A common [[Trope (literature)|trope]] in these works began with [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as [[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|Arthur C. Clarke's]] and [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|Stanley Kubrick's]] ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (both 1968), with [[HAL 9000]], the murderous computer in charge of the ''[[Discovery One]]'' spaceship, as well as ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951) and Bishop from ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buttazzo|first1=G.|title=Artificial consciousness: Utopia or real possibility?|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/933500/?reload=true|journal=[[Computer (magazine)|Computer (IEEE)]]|date=July 2001|volume=34|issue=7|pages=24–30|doi=10.1109/2.933500|accessdate=29 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230092217/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/933500/?reload=true|archivedate=30 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Asimov]] introduce the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] in many books and stories, most notably the "Multivac" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name. Asimov's laws are often brought up during layman discussions of machine ethics;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Susan Leigh. "Asimov's "three laws of robotics" and machine metaethics." AI &amp; Society 22.4 (2008): 477–493.&lt;/ref&gt; while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCauley | first1 = Lee | year = 2007 | title = AI armageddon and the three laws of robotics | url = | journal = Ethics and Information Technology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 153–164 | doi=10.1007/s10676-007-9138-2| citeseerx = 10.1.1.85.8904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transhumanism]] (the merging of humans and machines) is explored in the [[manga]] ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and the science-fiction series ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. In the 1980s, artist [[Hajime Sorayama]]'s Sexy Robots series were painted and published in Japan depicting the actual organic human form with lifelike muscular metallic skins and later "the Gynoids" book followed that was used by or influenced movie makers including [[George Lucas]] and other creatives. Sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always unnatural product of the human mind, a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form.

Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental of question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have [[sentience|the ability to feel]], and thus to suffer. This appears in [[Karel Čapek]]'s "[[R.U.R.]]", the films "[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]" and "[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]",  as well as the novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', by [[Philip K. Dick]]. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galvan|first=Jill|date=1 January 1997|title=Entering the Posthuman Collective in Philip K. Dick's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"|journal=Science Fiction Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=413–429|jstor=4240644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

&lt;ref name="Definition of AI"&gt;
Definition of AI as the study of [[intelligent agents]]:
* {{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|loc=[http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/ci/ch1.pdf p. 1]}}, which provides the version that is used in this article. Note that they use the term "computational intelligence" as a synonym for artificial intelligence.
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003}} (who prefer the term "rational agent") and write "The whole-agent view is now widely accepted in the field" {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=55}}.
* {{Harvnb|Nilsson|1998}}
&lt;!--These textbooks are the most widely used in academic AI.--&gt;
* {{Harvnb|Legg|Hutter|2007}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Coining of the term AI"&gt;
Although there is some controversy on this point (see {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|p=50}}), [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|McCarthy]] states unequivocally "I came up with the term" in a c|net interview. {{Harv|Skillings|2006}} McCarthy first used the term in the proposal for the Dartmouth conference, which appeared in 1955. {{Harv|McCarthy|Minsky|Rochester|Shannon|1955}}

&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

&lt;ref name="McCorduck's thesis"&gt;
This is a central idea of [[Pamela McCorduck]]'s ''Machines Who Think''. She writes: "I like to think of artificial intelligence as the scientific apotheosis of a venerable cultural tradition." {{Harv|McCorduck|2004|p=34}} "Artificial intelligence in one form or another is an idea that has pervaded Western intellectual history, a dream in urgent need of being realized." {{Harv|McCorduck|2004|p=xviii}} "Our history is full of attempts—nutty, eerie, comical, earnest, legendary and real—to make artificial intelligences, to reproduce what is the essential us—bypassing the ordinary means. Back and forth between myth and reality, our imaginations supplying what our workshops couldn't, we have engaged for a long time in this odd form of self-reproduction." {{Harv|McCorduck|2004|p=3}} She traces the desire back to its [[Hellenistic]] roots and calls it the urge to "forge the Gods." {{Harv|McCorduck|2004|pp=340–400}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Fragmentation of AI"&gt;
Pamela {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=424}} writes of "the rough shattering of AI in subfields—vision, natural language, decision theory, genetic algorithms, robotics&amp;nbsp;... and these with own sub-subfield—that would hardly have anything to say to each other."

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Gödel himself"&gt;
{{Harvnb|Gödel|1951}}: in this lecture, [[Kurt Gödel]] uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist [[Diophantine equations]] for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a "certain fact".

&lt;ref name="Searle's strong AI"&gt;
This version is from {{Harvtxt|Searle|1999}}, and is also quoted in {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=435}}. Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states." {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=1}}. Strong AI is defined similarly by {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}: "The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis."
&lt;/ref&gt;

''Multiple'' tests of artificial-intelligence efficacy are needed because, "just as there is no single test of [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletic]] prowess, there cannot be one ultimate test of [[intelligence]]."

Another proposal has been to give machines the same standardized tests of science and other disciplines that schoolchildren take.  A so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence is an incapacity for reliable [[disambiguation]].

Cinematic exhibition of the '''[[B movie]]''', defined as a relatively low-cost genre film, has declined substantially from the early 1980s to the present. Spurred by the historic success of several big-budget movies with B-style themes beginning in the [[B movies (The exploitation boom)#New markets for the B|mid-1970s]], the [[major film studio|major Hollywood studios]] moved progressively into the production of A-grade films in genres that had long been low-budget territory. With the majors also adopting [[exploitation film|exploitation]]-derived methods of booking and marketing, B movies began to be squeezed out of the commercial arena. The advent of [[digital video|digital cinema]] in the new millennium appeared to open up new opportunities for the distribution of inexpensive genre movies.

==The B movie loses its place: 1980s==
Most of the B-movie production houses founded during the [[B movies (The exploitation boom)|exploitation era]] collapsed or were subsumed by larger companies as the field's financial situation changed in the early 1980s. Even a comparatively cheap, efficiently made genre picture intended for theatrical release began to cost millions of dollars, as the major movie studios steadily moved into the production of expensive genre movies, raising audience expectations for spectacular action sequences and realistic special effects. Intimations of the trend were evident as early as ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1969) and especially in the mega-schlock of ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' (1972), ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1973), and ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974). Their disaster plots and dialogue were B-grade at best; from an industry perspective, however, these were pictures firmly rooted in the tradition of star-stuffed extravaganzas like ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956) and ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film)|Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' (1956). ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973) and, though not effects-driven, [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973) were the first serious steps in Hollywood's transformation into an industry built around high-budget B-themed movies. But the tidal shift in the majors' focus owed largely to the enormous success of three films: [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[monster movie|creature feature]] ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) and Lucas's [[space opera]] ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) had each, in turn, become the highest-grossing film in motion picture history. ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', released in December 1978, had proved that a studio could spend $55 million on a movie about a children's comic book character and make a very handsome profit. Not an all-time record-breaker like ''Jaws'' and ''Star Wars'', it was merely the biggest box-office hit of 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=superman.htm ''Superman'' (1978)] part of ''Box Office Mojo'' website. Retrieved 12/29/06.&lt;/ref&gt; Blockbuster fantasy spectacles like the original, 1933 ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' had once been exceptional; in the new Hollywood, increasingly under the sway of multi-industrial conglomerates, they would rule.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Studio system#The eight majors in the post-system era|The eight majors in the post-system era]] for a record of the sales and mergers involving the eight major studios of the Golden Age.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:BloodSimplePoster.jpg|thumb|left|250px|"Too gory to be an art film, too arty to be an exploitation film, funny but not quite a comedy": 168 private investors kicked in for ''[[Blood Simple]]'''s $1.5 million budget.&lt;ref&gt;David Handelman ("The Brothers from Another Planet," ''Rolling Stone'', May 21, 1987), quoted in Russell (2001), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In the tradition of [[Anthony Mann]] and [[John Alton]], brothers [[Joel and Ethan Coen]] brought high style back to the B [[film noir|noir]] in 1984; their intense but ironic take on the genre was [[Joe Dante|Dante-esque]].]]
It had taken a decade and half, from 1961 to 1976, for the production cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 million—actually a decline if adjusted for inflation. In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980 (a constant-dollar increase of about 25 percent). Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased, the average expense of moviemaking would continue to soar.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), p. 42. Prince (2002) gives $9 million as the average production cost in 1980, and a total of $13 million after adding on costs for manufacturing exhibition prints and marketing (p. 20). See also p. 21, chart 1.2. The ''Box Office Mojo'' website gives $9.4 million as the 1980 production figure; see [http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/ Movie Box Office Results by Year, 1980–Present]. Retrieved 12/29/06.&lt;/ref&gt; With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters, it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit. [[Revival house]]s were now the almost-exclusive preserve of the double feature. One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio [[Monogram Pictures|Allied Artists]], which declared bankruptcy in April 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Lubasch (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, [[American International Pictures]] (AIP) had moved into the production of relatively expensive comedies and genre films like the very successful ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|Amityville Horror]]'' and the disastrous, $20 million ''[[Meteor (film)|Meteor]]'' in 1979. That same year, the studio was sold off to [[Filmways]], a company with a history in TV production, and was dissolved as a moviemaking concern by the end of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2000), pp. 323–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Capitalizing on the popularity of ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'', in 1960 [[Roger Corman]] had made ''Atlas'' for a total of $75,000.&lt;ref&gt;Per Corman in Di Franco (1979), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, [[Universal Studios|Universal]] released a movie in the same tradition: fantasy plus muscles. The lead role was to be played by an Austrian-born actor with a great reputation as a bodybuilder but entirely unproven as a major film star. Adjusting for inflation, the cost of ''Atlas'' was about $400,000 in 1982 dollars. Production cost on ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' was an estimated $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082198/business Business Data for ''Conan the Barbarian'' (1982)] part of ''IMDb.com.'' Retrieved 1/8/07.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hercules'' had opened in 600 theaters, an astonishing figure at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2000), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Conan'' opened in 1,395, making it one of more than twenty movies that year to open at over 900 theaters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=releasedate&amp;view=opening&amp;yr=1982&amp;p=.htm  1982 Yearly Box Office Results] part of ''Box Office Mojo'' website. Retrieved 12/29/06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the mounting financial pressures, distribution obstacles, and overall risk, a substantial number of genre movies from small studios and independent filmmakers were still reaching theaters. In September 1980, Corman released his most expensive movie to date: ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'', with screenplay by [[John Sayles]] and art direction by [[James Cameron]], cost his [[New World Pictures]] a grand total of $2 million. By comparison, the ''Star Wars'' sequel ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', which came out three-and-a-half months before the Corman epic, was originally budgeted at $18.5 million and wound up costing $33 million, triple the cost of ''Star Wars'' just three years before.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey-Kallis (2001), pp. 204–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Horror was the strongest low-budget genre of the time, particularly in the "[[slasher film|slasher]]" mode as with ''[[The Slumber Party Massacre]]'' (1982), directed by Amy Holden-Jones and written by feminist author [[Rita Mae Brown]]. The film was produced for New World on a budget of $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;Collum (2004), pp. 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 1983, Corman sold New World; New Horizons, later Concorde–New Horizons, became his primary company. In 1984, New Horizons released a critically applauded movie set amid the [[punk subculture|punk scene]] written and directed by [[Penelope Spheeris]]. Vincent Canby's admiring review ends with a definitive compliment: "''[[Suburbia (film)|Suburbia]]'' is a good genre film."&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1984). Note that [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086589/ IMDb.com's entry on the film] incorrectly states that it was released by New World. Note that in his [http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2006/great-directors/corman/ ''Senses of Cinema'' entry on Corman], Professor Wheeler Winston Dixon makes the following error: "Aimed strictly at the home video and direct-to-cable market, Corman's Concorde films included such titles as Penelope Spheeris' ''Suburbia'' (1984)." Aside from the fact that the Concorde name did not appear on the film, it received a widely reviewed theatrical release.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer-director [[Larry Cohen]] continued to twist genre conventions in pictures such as ''[[Q (film)|Q]]'' (aka ''Q: The Winged Serpent''; 1982): "the kind of movie that used to be indispensable to the market: an imaginative, popular, low-budget picture that makes the most of its limited resources, and in which people get on with the job instead of standing around talking about it."&lt;ref&gt;Petit (1999), p. 1172.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, [[New Line Cinema]] put out ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'', a [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] movie with an estimated $300,000 budget and an old-school exploitation gimmick: Odorama. In October that year, a gore-filled yet stylish horror movie made for less than $400,000 was premiered at a theater in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Cost per Bruce Campbell, cited in Warren (2001), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The writer, director, and co–executive producer of ''The Book of the Dead'', [[Sam Raimi]], was a week shy of his twenty-second birthday; star and co–executive producer [[Bruce Campbell]] was twenty-three. Retitled ''[[The Evil Dead]]'', it was picked up for distribution by New Line in 1983 and became a critical and commercial hit. Comparing it to ''Night of the Living Dead'', one reviewer said "it achieves a similarly claustrophobic intensity on a microscopic budget. It's a shoestring ''tour de force''."&lt;ref&gt;David Chute (''Los Angeles Herald-Examiner'', May 27, 1983), quoted in Warren (2001), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most successful B-movie companies of the 1980s was a survivor from the heyday of the exploitation era, [[Troma Entertainment|Troma Pictures]], founded in 1974. Troma's most characteristic productions, including ''[[Class of Nuke 'Em High]]'' (1986), ''[[Redneck Zombies]]'' (1986), and ''[[Surf Nazis Must Die]]'' (1987), take exploitation for an absurdist spin. Troma also built on another B-studio tradition: re-releasing the often embarrassing early films of actors turning into major stars. In 1986, the company acquired and distributed two unreleased films, ''Sizzle Beach U.S.A.'' (shot in 1974) and ''Shadows Run Black'' (shot in 1981), capitalizing on performances by [[Kevin Costner]], who had recently appeared in the popular ''[[Silverado (film)|Silverado]]'' (1985) and was set to headline ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;Harper (2004), pp. 156–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Troma's best-known production is ''[[The Toxic Avenger (film)|The Toxic Avenger]]'' (1985), whose hero, after plunging into a vat of [[toxic waste]] while attempting to escape a loathsome gang of tormentors, mutates into a hideous creature with enhanced physical strength and revenge on what's left of his mind. After the film's successful release, the character, affectionately known as Toxie, became the symbol of Troma and an icon of the 1980s B movie. One of the few successful B-studio startups of the decade was Rome-based [[Empire International Pictures|Empire Pictures]], whose first production, ''[[Ghoulies]]'', reached theaters in 1985. Despite other profitable ventures such as ''[[Re-Animator]]'' (1985), financial difficulties forced the company's American founder to sell it off in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow (1996), pp. 112–13; [http://www.cinematical.com/2005/10/03/interview-charles-band/ "Interview: Charles Band"] interview by Robert Newton, October 3, 2005; part of ''Cinematical'' website. Retrieved 1/4/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of the [[cable television]] industry in the 1980s helped support the low-budget film market, as many B movies quickly wound up as "filler" material for 24-hour cable channels or were made expressly for that purpose. The broadcast version of the [[midnight movie]] remained popular: the nationally syndicated ''Movie Macabre'' package starring [[Cassandra Peterson]]—aka Elvira, Mistress of the Dark—was essentially a brassier copy of ''[[Maila Nurmi|The Vampira Show]]'', presenting mostly low-budget horror films interspersed with Elvira's satiric commentary and abundant display of cleavage. The video rental market was also becoming central to B-film economics: Empire's financial model, for instance, relied on seeing a profit not from theatrical rentals, but only later, at the video store.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow (1996), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Concorde–New Horizon releases appeared only briefly in theaters, or not at all.

==B's in the arthouse: 1990s==
By 1990, the cost of the average U.S. film had passed $25 million.&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo.com"&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/ Movie Box Office Results by Year, 1980–Present] part of ''Box Office Mojo'' website. Retrieved 12/29/06.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the nine films released that year to gross more than $100 million at the U.S. box office, two would have been strictly B-movie material before the late 1970s: ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' and ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. Three more—the science-fiction thriller ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'', the action-filled detective thriller ''[[Die Hard 2]]'', and the year's biggest hit, the slapstick kiddie comedy ''[[Home Alone]]''—were also far closer to the traditional arena of the B's than to classic A-list subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1990&amp;p=.htm 1990 Yearly Box Office Results] part of ''Box Office Mojo'' website. Retrieved 12/29/06. Dick Tracy literally had been B-movie material—the character was featured in four low-budget RKO films in the mid- to late 1940s. For how espionage and crimebusting thrillers historically were "widely regarded as nothing more than B-movie fodder," see James Chapman, ''Licence to Thrill: A Cultural History of the James Bond Films'' (New York and Chichester, West Sussex: Columbia University Press, 2000), pp. 46–50.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing popularity of home video and access to unedited movies on cable and [[satellite television]] along with real estate pressures were making survival more difficult for the sort of small- or non-chain theaters that were the primary home of independently produced genre films. Drive-in screens were rapidly disappearing from the American landscape: between 1987 and 1990, the number in operation fell from 2,507 to 910.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drive-ins.com/exbgover.htm A Brief Overview] part of the ''Drive on In'' website.

Surviving B-movie operations adapted in different ways. Releases from Troma now frequently went [[direct-to-video|straight to video]]. As if in farewell, the company brought a title to the big screen in 1991 that summed up much of the preceding three-and-a-half decades of B movies: ''[[Chopper Chicks in Zombietown]]''. Empire's founder, [[Charles Band]], started a new production company, [[Full Moon Features|Full Moon]], specifically to address the direct-to-video market. New Line, in its first decade, had been almost exclusively a distributor of low-budget independent and foreign genre pictures. With the smash success of exploitation veteran [[Wes Craven]]'s original ''[[Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984), whose nearly $2 million cost it had directly backed, the company began moving steadily into higher-budget genre productions. In 1994, New Line was sold to the [[Turner Broadcasting System]]; it was soon being run as a midsized studio with a broad range of product alongside [[Warner Bros.]] within the [[Time Warner]] conglomerate. The following year, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] launched ''Roger Corman Presents'', a series of thirteen straight-to-cable movies produced by Concorde–New Horizons. A ''New York Times'' reviewer found that the initial installment qualified as "vintage Corman...spiked with everything from bared female breasts to a mind-blowing quote from [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[Death in Venice]]''."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as exhibition venues for B films vanished, the independent film movement was burgeoning; among the results were various crossovers between the low-budget genre movie and the "sophisticated" arthouse picture. Director [[Abel Ferrara]], who built a reputation with violent B movies such as ''[[The Driller Killer]]'' (1979) and ''[[Ms. 45]]'' (1981), made two works in the early nineties that marry exploitation-worthy depictions of sex, drugs, and general sleaze to complex examinations of honor and redemption: ''[[King of New York]]'' (1990) was backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of ''[[Bad Lieutenant]]'' (1992), $1.8 million, was financed totally independently.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone (1999), p. 16; [http://mondofausto.com/interview-abelferrara.htm "Abel Ferrara, Bad Lieutenant"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815203650/http://mondofausto.com/interview-abelferrara.htm |date=2007-08-15 }} part of the Mondo Video website. Retrieved 1/1/07. Online claims that ''King of New York'' was budgeted at $8 million do not appear to be well founded. No reliable figure has been located to date.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrara followed these two movies with ''[[Body Snatchers]]'' (1993), a major-studio remake of the sci-fi classic and an acknowledgment of his debt to the B's of an earlier generation. [[Larry Fessenden]]'s micro-budget monster movies, such as ''No Telling'' (1991) and ''Habit'' (1997), reframe classic genre subjects—[[Frankenstein]] and [[vampire|vampirism]], respectively—to explore issues of contemporary relevance—animal experimentation, ecological destruction, drug addiction, and fin-de-siècle urban romance. Written and directed by Jeremy Horton, ''[[100 Proof (film)|100 Proof]]'' (1997) is based on the true story of a killing spree that occurred in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], a decade earlier. Praising its authentic depiction of the impoverished milieu in which it is set, critics variously described its style as evoking a home movie or a reality-style TV police series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Holden, Stephen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/proof-film-review.html|title='100 Proof': Sullen Slice of Sullen Lives|work=The New York Times|date=1997-09-24|accessdate=2010-02-26}} {{cite web |author=Fox, Ken|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/100-proof/review/132519|title=''100 Proof'': Review|publisher=TVGuide.com|date=|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', capturing the way it crossed the line between genre and art film, called it a "diamond in the rough, or at least a shiny bit of jagged rhinestone."&lt;ref name=Leydon&gt;{{cite web |author=Leydon, Joe|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117432607.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0|title=''100 Proof''|work=Variety|date=1997-03-02|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Cronenberg]], one of the leading B-movie [[auteur]]s of the [[B movies (The exploitation boom)#Sleazeballs and slashers: 1970s|1970s]], had stepped up in financial grade with ''[[Scanners]]'' (1980), a $3.5 million production that ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' critic [[Richard Corliss]] associated with his earlier, low-budget films as well as [[George A. Romero]]'s ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978) and [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[The Fog]]'' (1980) as "hip parables of contemporary moral malaise."&lt;ref&gt;Corliss (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Cronenberg's crowning achievement in that vein would come a decade and a half later: Like that of ''Scanners'' in 1980, the budget of ''[[Crash (1996 film)|Crash]]'', $10 million, wasn't comfortably A-grade by 1996, but it was hardly B-level either. The film's imagery was another matter: "On its scandalizing surface, David Cronenberg's ''Crash'' suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick," is how [[Janet Maslin]]'s ''New York Times'' review begins. The review ends with an explanation of the film's rating: "''Crash'' has the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#X is replaced by NC-17|NC-17 rating]] (No one under 17 admitted) that it fully deserves. It includes frontal nudity, many sexual encounters and coolly grotesque situations linking sex and violence in graphic, sickening ways."&lt;ref&gt;Maslin (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Financed, like ''King of New York'', by a consortium of production companies, it was ultimately picked up for U.S. distribution by [[Fine Line Features]]. In more ways than one, this result resonated perfectly with the way the film scrambled definitions: Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line, recently merged into the Time Warner empire—specifically, it was the old exploitation distributor's arthouse division.

==The B movie in the digital age: 2000s==
By the turn of the millennium, the average production cost of an American feature had already spent three years above the $50 million mark.&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo.com"/&gt; In 2005, the top ten movies at the U.S. box office included three adaptations of children's fantasy novels (including [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|one extending]] and [[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (film)|another initiating a series]], as well as a [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|remake]] of a [[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory|1971 film]]), a [[Madagascar (2005 film)|child-targeted cartoon]], a [[Batman Begins|comic book adaptation]], a [[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|sci-fi series installment]], a [[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|sci-fi remake]], and a [[King Kong (2005 film)|''King Kong'' remake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2005&amp;p=.htm 2005 Yearly Box Office Results] part of ''Box Office Mojo'' website. Retrieved 1/2/07.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a slow year for Corman: he produced just one movie, which had no American theatrical release, true of most of the pictures he had been involved in recently. ''Bloodfist 2050'', directed by long-time B filmmaker and Corman collaborator [[Cirio H. Santiago]], went straight to DVD in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.firecracker-media.com/issue17/interview1701.shtml "Made in the Philippines: Cirio H. Santiago Interviewed"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607010419/http://www.firecracker-media.com/issue17/interview1701.shtml |date=2013-06-07 }} interview by Erika Franklin, ''Firecracker'' webzine, April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultrawide openings at many thousands of theaters were becoming the norm. In May 2007 alone, three fantasy blockbusters—''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' (third in a series based on an amusement-park ride), ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (third in a series based on a superhero comic book), and ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (third in a series of "family" cartoons)—each opened on over 10,000 screens.&lt;ref&gt;Halbfinger (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; As big-budget Hollywood movies further usurped the genre territories that were traditionally the domain of the B's, the ongoing viability of the familiar brand of B movie was in grave doubt. Critic [[A. O. Scott]] of the ''New York Times'' warned of the impending "extinction" of
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the cheesy, campy, guilty pleasures that used to bubble up with some regularity out of the B-picture ooze of cut-rate genre entertainment. Those cherished bad movies—full of jerry-built effects, abominable acting, ludicrous story lines—once flickered with zesty crudity in drive-ins and grind houses across the land. B-picture genres—science fiction and comic-book fantasy in particular, but also kiddie cartoons and horror pictures—now dominate the A-list, commanding the largest budgets and the most attention from the market-research and quality-control departments of the companies that manufacture them.... [F]or the most part, the schlock of the past has evolved into star-driven, heavily publicized, expensive mediocrities....&lt;ref&gt;Scott (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, recent industry trends suggest the reemergence of something that looks very like the traditional A-B split in major studio production, though with fewer "programmers" bridging the gap. According to a 2006 report by industry analyst Alfonso Marone, "The average budget for a Hollywood movie is currently around $60m, rising to $100m when the cost of marketing for domestic launch (USA only) is factored into the equation. However, we are now witnessing a polarisation of film budgets into two tiers: large productions ($120–150m) and niche features ($5–20m). The rationale is that the likelihood of success is maximised by coupling ultra-large budget and highly marketable features (e.g., ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]''), with multiple low-cost bets (e.g., ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]''). Fewer $30–70m releases are expected."&lt;ref name=Marone&gt;{{cite web|author=Marone, Alfonso |url=http://www.spectrumstrategy.com/Pages/GB/perspectives/Spectrum-The-Hollywood-movie-business.pdf |title=One More Ride on the Hollywood Roller-coaster |publisher=Spectrum Strategy Consultants |year=2006 |accessdate=2006-12-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203004153/http://www.spectrumstrategy.com/Pages/GB/perspectives/Spectrum-The-Hollywood-movie-business.pdf |archivedate=3 February 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Little Miss Sunshine'' was produced by [[Fox Searchlight]], the major studio's pseudo-[[independent film|indie]] subsidiary, for $8 million. With its quirky, "indie"-style comedy, the film hardly meets any conventional definition of a B movie beyond its relatively small budget, but the sorts of movies embraced by the term have shifted drastically before. Classic [[film noir]]'s combination of visual beauty and verbal wit, for instance, was hardly common coin in exploitation-era B filmmaking. Further expanding the field, [[20th Century-Fox|Fox]] launched a new subsidiary in 2006, [[Fox Atomic]], to concentrate on teen-oriented genre films (horror in particular, at first, then increasingly comedy, as well). The genre focus was similar to that of [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[Screen Gems]] division and the [[The Weinstein Company|Weinsteins]]' [[Dimension Films]], but the economic model was deliberately low-rent, at least by major studio standards. According to a ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' report, "Fox Atomic is staying at or below the $10 million mark for many of its movies. It's also encouraging filmmakers to shoot digitally—a cheaper process that results in a grittier, teen-friendly look. And forget about stars. Of Atomic's nine announced films, not one has a big-name."&lt;ref&gt;Zeitchik and Laporte (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, this was an updated version of a Golden Age big studio B unit targeting a market very similar to the one [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] and [[James H. Nicholson]]'s AIP helped define in the [[B movies (Transition in the 1950s)#AIP and Corman|1950s]]. Despite its low budgets and consequently low benchmarks for profitability, Fox Atomic's output was seen as unsuccessful by its parent company, which shut it down in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fleming, Michael|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002584.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title=Fox Folding Atomic Label|work=Variety|date=2009-04-19|accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a development hinted at by the ''Variety'' quotation above, technological advances are greatly facilitating the production of truly low-budget motion pictures. Although there have always been economical means with which to shoot movies, including [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] and [[16 mm film]], as well as [[video]] cameras recording onto [[analog signal|analog]] [[videotape]], these mediums could hardly rival the image quality of [[35 mm film]]. The development and widespread usage of [[digital video|digital cameras]] and [[postproduction]] methods allow even low-budget filmmakers to produce films with excellent (and not necessarily "grittier") image quality and precise editing effects—though technical excellence is no guarantee of aesthetic value or even cinematographic competence. As Marone observes, "the equipment budget (camera, support) required for shooting digital is approximately 1/10 that for film, significantly lowering the production budget for independent features." Comparing circumstances in 2006 to those just a couple of years earlier, he argues that the "quality of digital filmmaking has improved dramatically."&lt;ref name=Marone/&gt;

Independent filmmakers, whether working in a genre or arthouse mode, continue to find it difficult to gain access to distribution channels, though so-called digital end-to-end methods of distribution offer new opportunities. The so-called day-and-date strategy, in a which a film is released simultaneously in theaters as well as DVD and/or cable, may offer a way for the true low-budget B movie to regain some of the audience it has lost.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of how day-and-date is being used for independent and foreign arthouse films, see Dargis (2007), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar fashion, the popularity of Internet sites such as [[YouTube]] have opened up entirely new avenues for the presentation of motion pictures made on a shoestring. Abel Ferrara, envisioning his first digital film, says, "I want to do it on the Internet...and put it out in 10-minute increments. I know that watching films on computer is the future—it's a direct connection to the audience."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson (2007), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these developments have come together to create a boom in a relatively new form of low-budget genre picture. The fan film, typically an unauthorized production set in the imaginary universe of a popular genre movie or TV series, may be thought of as the most widespread present incarnation of the B movie. "Arguably the first fan film was ''[[Hardware Wars]]'', a short spoof from 1977 depicting toasters and egg-beaters fighting in space," according to journalist Curt Holman. "In the first decade of the new millenni[um], fan films have grown exponentially in quantity and improved significantly in quality and ambition...[t]hanks to digital cameras, affordable editing software and online distribution."&lt;ref name="Holman 2007, p. 12"&gt;Holman (2007), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, [[Lucasfilm]] created a yearly award ceremony for noncommercial fan films, arranging to screen them online via [[AtomFilms]] (purchased in 2006 by [[MTV Networks]]). ''Star Wars: Revelations'' (2005), a 40-minute drama directed by Shane Felux for a production cost of $20,000, has apparently been downloaded by millions.&lt;ref name="Holman 2007, p. 12"/&gt; Similar projects are designed as "episodes" set in the TV-based ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' universes. A parallel development in fan culture has been inspired in part by the direct-to-video market, whose products garner little notice and less respect in mainstream culture. According to scholar Linda Ruth Williams, the "new B-movie culture runs on the convoluted equation that cheap means bad which means good. Such products garner far more respect from fans because they manage to press the same buttons on one million dollars (or less) rather than one hundred million (or more)."&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2005), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, [[The Asylum]]—a production company founded in 1997—has specialized in low-budget pictures also inspired by the big-budget films that have largely usurped the B movie's place in the theatrical market. The company makes what one critic dubbed "[[mockbuster]]s", straight-to-video knockoffs of major studio action pictures: ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'', for instance, is transformed into The Asylum's ''[[Transmorphers]]''.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web |author=Potts, Rolf|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/magazine/07wwln-essay-t.html?_r=3&amp;ref=magazine&amp;oref=slogin|title=The New B Movie|work=New York Times Magazine|date=2007-10-07|accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another commercial relative of the fan film is the overt B-movie homage. [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]]'s ''[[grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' (2007) nods to a wide variety of exploitation styles popular from the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Criticizing the film, notwithstanding its "posture of cool," as yet another "blockbuster B-movie," Adario Strange places it in historical context: "Despite themselves, Tarantino and Rodriguez have the right idea. As the tools for filmmaking have become cheaper and more malleable, now is the time for rough, ugly, experimental films to shine again as they did in the '70s. The problem for these directors is that they are just too rich, too well-connected and too self-aware to produce films that are truly spit and chewing gum, bleeding-edge like Eric Nicholas' ''[[Alone With Her]]'', [[Vincent Gallo]]'s ''[[The Brown Bunny]]'' or [[Shane Carruth]]'s ''[[Primer (film)|Primer]]''—films most Americans will never see."&lt;ref&gt;Strange (2007), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The photos appearing in the magazine had various sources; some are obtained from companies that produce gay pornographic films (although most layouts depict individual men, rather than simulated "action" scenes). Photographers whose work appeared in ''Black Inches'' include Anneli Adolfsson, Ken Kavanagh, Brian Lantelme, and Abednego (formerly associated with Mansurf.com). The magazine also carried film reviews, erotic stories, cartoons, and advertisements.

==''Black Inches'' in gay culture==
D. J. Murphy's ''Sons Like Me'' starts with a reference to ''Black Inches'' in its first lines:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"What the hell is this, Travis?" My mom yelled as she held the ''Black Inches'' porno magazine in her hand.&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Murphy, ''Sons Like Me'' (Lincoln, Nebr.: iUniverse, 2002), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other novels that mention the magazine include John Weir's ''What I Did Wrong''&lt;ref&gt;See John Weir, ''What I Did Wrong'' (New York: Viking, 2006), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jim Norton's ''Happy Ending''.&lt;ref&gt;See Jim Norton, ''Happy Ending'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2007), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Black Inches'' featured every major gay black porn star in photo shoots and interviews, from [[Bobby Blake]] and [[Tyson Cane]] to [[Tiger Tyson]], J. C. Carter, and T-Malone. Bobby Blake writes of his relationship with the magazine, "''Black Inches'' was always very supportive of me. They reviewed every film I made, did photo-shoots, interviewed me, and gave me my own column."&lt;ref&gt;Bobby Blake (with John R. Gordon), ''My Life in Porn: The Bobby Blake Story'' (Philadelphia: The Running Press, 2008), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brandenburg stone''' is an inscribed stone slab found in [[Brandenburg, Kentucky|Brandenburg]], [[Kentucky]], [[United States]] in 1912, on the farm of Craig Crecelius. The stone contains a strip of linear markings that resemble letters of a script. Crecelius exhibited the stone several times, but was unable to find anyone who could identify the markings.

Jon Whitfield, who acquired the stone in 1965, claims that they are [[Coelbren y Beirdd|Coelbren]], a Welsh-language alphabet. Other writers have elaborated on these claims, arguing that this is evidence of pre-Columbian contact between the legendary Welsh prince [[Madoc]] and Native Americans. The consensus of Welsh scholars is that "Coelbren" is a fake script invented in the late eighteenth century by [[Iolo Morganwg]] in his book ''[[Barddas]]''.

==History==
In 1912, farmer Craig Crecelius found the stone artifact in a field near the Ohio River in Brandenburg, Kentucky. The [[oolite]] stone measures {{convert|29|in|cm|}} long by {{convert|15.5|in|cm|}} wide and varies in thickness from {{convert|1|to|3|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name=See /&gt; For more than 50 years, Crecelius displayed the stone at local fairs. At some point, the stone was shattered into three pieces.

In 1965, Crecelius abandoned his pursuit of the artifact's origin and transferred ownership to Jon Whitfield. Eight years later, archaeologists examined the stone and concluded that its markings were actually scratches resulting from a natural process. The stone was stored at the [[Meade County Public Library|Brandenburg library]] until 1995 when it was moved to the Falls of the Ohio Interpretive Center in Clarksville, Indiana.&lt;ref name=CCPL /&gt;

In 1999, the artifact was moved to the [[Falls of the Ohio State Park]] Interpretive Center for a year, and then to the [[Charlestown, Indiana]] public library. In January 2012 the artifact was returned to the [[Meade County Public Library|Meade county library]].&lt;ref name=DN-990723 /&gt;

==Claims of Welsh origin==
[[File:Peithynen - displaying Bardic Alphabet (coelbren y beirdd).jpg|thumb|One of Morganwg's "peithynen" frames containing his "bardic" alphabet]]
Whitfield sought evidence that the markings were Welsh in origin. In 1998, the stone was examined by authors Baram Blackett and Alan Wilson, who asserted that the inscription was medieval Welsh. Blackett and Wilson have also claimed to have found the grave of King Arthur and the Ark of the Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;"Historians Battle over Arthurian Intrigue", ''Evening Chronicle'', Newcastle, England, June 12, 2008, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; They translated the inscriptions into English from [[Coelbren (alphabet)|Coelbren]], the script described by Iolo Morganwg, and which modern scholars believe to have been invented by him.&lt;ref name=CCPL /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coelbren y Beirdd - The Bardic Alphabet|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/888/|publisher=National Museum of Wales|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117215438/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/888/|archivedate=2010-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cathryn|first=A Charnell-White|title=Bardic Circles: National, Regional and Personal Identity in the Bardic Vision of Iolo Morganwg|year=2007|publisher=University of Wales Press|isbn=978-0708320679|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone's inscription was translated to read: "Toward strength (to promote unity), divide the land we are spread over, purely (or justly) between offspring in wisdom."&lt;ref name=CCPL /&gt;&lt;ref name=DN-990723 /&gt; This was interpreted to mean that it was a boundary marker. [[Jefferson Community and Technical College|Jefferson Community College]] writer Lee Pennington has endorsed claims of the artifact's ancient Welsh origin. The claims have been widely circulated.&lt;ref name=See&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.meadecountymessenger.com/contentitem/215582/2035/archaeologists-gather-to-hear-story-of-brandenburg-stone | title=Archaeologists gather to hear story of Brandenburg Stone | publisher=Meade County Messenger | date=March 19, 2008 | accessdate=March 24, 2013 | author=See, Larry Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CCPL&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.clarkco.lib.in.us/history/brandenburgstone.htm | title=Brandenburg Stone | publisher=Clark County (Indiana) Public Library | accessdate=March 24, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430102435/http://www.clarkco.lib.in.us/history/brandenburgstone.htm | archivedate=April 30, 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DN-990723&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gPIaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4UcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4713,3166828&amp;dq=brandenburg-stone&amp;hl=en | title=Secretive Stone Gets New Home in Indiana | date=July 23, 1999 | agency=Daily News | accessdate=March 24, 2013 | location=Bowling Green, Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=DoCJUB42lokC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Brandenburg+stone#v=onepage&amp;q=Brandenburg%20stone&amp;f=false | title=Weird Kentucky: Your Travel Guide to Kentucky's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets | publisher=Sterling | author=Holland, Jeffrey Scott | year=2008 | pages=23 | isbn=978-1402754388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Callahan&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=553oiuqBxmkC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Brandenburg+stone%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Brandenburg%20stone%22&amp;f=false | title=Lest We Forget: The Melungeon Colony of Newman's Ridge | publisher=Overmountain Press | author=Callahan, Jim | year=2000 | pages=57 | isbn=978-1570721670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
More recently, the artifact has been a subject of several books as well an episode of the [[H2 (TV channel)|H2]] documentary ''[[America Unearthed]]''. Author [[Jason Colavito]] has argued against the stone's authenticity, asserting that it was forged in the 19th or early 20th century when several books promoting "Coelbren" were widely circulated in America.&lt;ref name=Colavito&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jasoncolavito.com/1/post/2013/02/following-up-on-the-brandenburg-stone.html | title=Following Up on the Brandenburg Stone | date=February 8, 2013 | accessdate=March 25, 2013 | author=Colavito, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Byron Bay''' is a beachside town located in the [[Northern Rivers|far-northeastern corner]] of the state of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It is located {{convert|772|km|mi|0}} north of [[Sydney]] and {{convert|165|km|mi|0}} south of [[Brisbane]]. [[Cape Byron]], a headland adjacent to the town, is the easternmost point of mainland Australia. At the [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]], the town had a permanent population of 9,246.&lt;ref name="abs"/&gt; The town is in turn the nucleus of [[Byron Shire]], which had 31,556 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Census 2016 AUS|id=LGA11350|name=Byron Shire |accessdate=1 October 2018|quick=on}}[[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016050101/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/# |date=16 October 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of Europeans in Byron Bay began in 1770, when Lieutenant [[James Cook]] found a safe anchorage and named [[Cape Byron]] after a fellow sailor [[John Byron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=Penny |editor1-first=Justine |editor1-last=Vaisutis |title=Lonely Planet: Australia |edition= 15|date=November 2009 |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |isbn= |page= 195 |chapter= New South Wales |quote= The Grandfather of the [...] poet Lord Byron was a renowned navigator in the 1760s, and Captain Cook named this spot after [...] him. (In the 1880s, when Europeans settled more permanently, streets were named for other English writers and philosophers. A star-struck clerk in Sydney thought the grandson was the one being honoured, and named the streets – and the town – after poets: [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first industry in Byron was cedar logging from the Australian red cedar (''[[Toona ciliata]]''). The timber industry is the origin of the word "shoot" in many local names – Possum Shoot, Coopers Shoot and Skinners Shoot – where the timber-cutters would "shoot" the logs down the hills to be dragged to waiting ships.&lt;ref name="early_settlement"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://byronbayhistoricalsociety.org.au/development-of-byron-bay/early-settlement/# |title=Byron Bay Historical Society: Early Settlement |access-date=27 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815012228/http://byronbayhistoricalsociety.org.au/development-of-byron-bay/early-settlement/# |archive-date=15 August 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Timber getting became insignificant after [[World War I]] and many former timber workers became farmers.

Gold mining of the beaches was the next industry to occur. Up to 20 mining leases set up on Tallow Beach to extract gold from the black sands around the 1870s.

Byron Bay has a history of primary industrial production ([[dairy]] factory,&lt;ref&gt;''Creamery Tramway at Byron Bay'' Longworth, Jim [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], October 1996, pp. 295–298.&lt;/ref&gt; [[abattoirs]], fishing, and [[whaling]] until 1963) and was a significant, but hazardous, sea port. The poet Brunton Stephens spoke of cattle grazing on the "mossy plains" of Cape Byron in a poem he penned in 1876.

The first [[jetty]] was built in 1886, and the railway was connected in 1894, and Cavvanbah became Byron Bay in 1894.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; Dairy farmers cleared more land and settled the area. In 1895, the [[Norco Co-operative]] was formed to provide cold storage and manage the dairy industry.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norco.com.au/publish/history/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012104655/http://www.norco.com.au/publish/history/index.php |archivedate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[paspalum]] improved production, and Byron Bay exported butter to the world. The Norco factory was the biggest in the southern hemisphere,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} expanding from dairy to [[bacon]] and other processed meat.

== Tourism ==
[[File:Byron Bay (Australia) main Beach from town.JPG|thumb|The main beach in 2006]]
[[File:Byron Bay Lighthouse.JPG|thumb|[[Cape Byron Light|Byron Bay Lighthouse]]]]

The town has several beaches which are popular for [[surfing]]. It is a resort popular with both domestic and international tourists, including [[backpacking (urban)|backpackers]], who travel along the Australian coast; the scenery also attracts skydivers. The area is also noted for its wildlife, with the [[whale watching]] industry a significant contributor to the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/byron-bay-area/byron-bay|title=Byron Bay|publisher=Visit NSW|accessdate=19 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208035053/http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/byron-bay-area/byron-bay#|archive-date=8 December 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[oceanway]] runs from the centre of town to the Cape Byron lighthouse. This allows visitors to walk and cycle to the lighthouse.

Temperate and tropical waters merge at Byron Bay, making it a popular area for [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkelling]]. Most diving is done at [[Julian Rocks]] which is part of the recently established [[Cape Byron Marine Park]] and only a few minutes boat ride from Main Beach.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Byron Bay also lies close to subtropical rainforests, and areas such as the [[Nightcap National Park]] with the [[Minyon Falls]] are all within easy reach of the town.

Byron Bay is now also a popular destination for [[Schoolies week]] during late November and early December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/byron-bay-schoolies-put-gold-coast-to-shame-20091130-jzb8.html|title=Byron Bay Schoolies 'put Gold Coast to shame'|date=30 November 2009|publisher=[[Brisbane Times]]|access-date=29 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203103359/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/byron-bay-schoolies-put-gold-coast-to-shame-20091130-jzb8.html#|archive-date=3 December 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
A bus station in Jonson Street is serviced by [[Greyhound Australia]], [[NSW TrainLink]] and [[Premier Transport Group|Premier Motor Services]] coach services from [[Sydney]] and [[Brisbane]].

The [[Byron Bay Railroad Company|Byron Bay Train]] service will operate as a shuttle between Byron Bay station in the Byron township and North Beach station. The privately run service operates on a 3 km section of the disused [[Murwillumbah railway line|Murwillimbah line]]. It is expected to open by Christmas 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadsheet.com.au/national/city-file/article/worlds-first-solar-powered-train-heads-byron-bay|title=The World’s First Solar-Powered Train Heads to Byron Bay|work=Broadsheet|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029121255/https://www.broadsheet.com.au/national/city-file/article/worlds-first-solar-powered-train-heads-byron-bay#|archive-date=29 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Byron Bay railway station]] was a stop on the [[Murwillumbah railway line|Casino to Murwillumbah railway line]] until 2004. It was served by trains from Sydney and for various periods also by services originating at Casino that connected with expresses running between Sydney and South Brisbane. A 3.4&amp;nbsp;km section of the Murwillumbah railway line is to be rehabilitated in 2016 for a two car self-propelled diesel train planned to run from the town centre to the Elements of Byron resort and nearby attractions.

An earlier local train service, known as the Byron Bay Tram conveyed passengers from about 1928 until about 1954 between the railway station and the "new jetty" where connections were made with passenger carrying ships of the North Coast Steam Navigation Company. Motive power was a Simplex petrol locomotive, locally known as the "Green Frog", and the passenger vehicles comprised former Newcastle B2 class steam tram trailer 74B and former Sydney C class electric tram C37. After the trams stopped running both the cars went to a heritage tramway in Parramatta Park where 74B was destroyed by fire. The Simplex was built in Bedford England and went into service in 1923 shunting freight to and from the "old" jetty adjacent to the township and then to "new" jetty to the north when it was completed in 1928. Later it hauled whales from the jetty to the rendering down works, livestock to the meat works, mineral sands and meat wagons to the station for onward movement and regularly shunted Norco and other railway sidings and between these duties ran the passenger tramway until the coastal passenger shipping service stopped. The Simplex locomotive was retired in 1984 when the meat works closed and is now stored in a shed near the Kendall Street level crossing under the care of volunteers and the Byron Bay Council.

== Education ==
Byron Bay schools include Byron Bay Public School, [[Byron Bay High School]], St Finbarr's Primary School, Byron Bay Community School, and [[Cape Byron Rudolf Steiner School]]. Among these are a number of early childhood facilities including Byron Bay Preschool and Periwinkle Preschool. In the fields of adult education there are Lexis English Centres (previously Global Village English Centres) and Byron Bay English Language School (BBELS) (both organisations providing English language tuition to international students), the Byron Region Community College, which is a registered training organisation and the SAE Institute Byron Bay which is a government-accredited, degree granting institution in the fields of audio engineering, digital film making, multimedia and animation.

== Sport and recreation ==
The Byron Bay Surf Club is the longest-standing current sports club; it has been one of Australia's leading surf clubs and has been in continuous operation for more than 105 years. The [[rugby league]] club the [[Byron Bay Red Devils]] and the [[Australian rules football]] team [[Byron Football Club|Byron Magpies]] are well known. Byron Bay FC has won the Football Far North Coast Premier league three times, most recently in 2013. Other clubs include Byron Bay Golf Club, Byron Bay Cricket Club, Byron Bay Rugby Union Club, Byron Bay Gliding Club, Byron Bay Hang Gliding / Paragliding Club and the Byron Bay Bowling Club.

A '''charro''' or '''charra outfit''' or '''suit''' (''traje de charro'', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]])&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/mariachi#ref878892|title=Mariachi|last=|first=|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a style of dress originating in [[Mexico]] and based on the clothing of a type of horseman, the [[charro]]. The style of clothing is often associated with [[mariachi]] and [[ranchera music]] performers, [[History of Mexico|Mexican history]], and celebration in festivals. The charro outfit is one that is associated with Mexico around the world. It is seen as a national emblem and a way to express personal pride in Mexican heritage. Charro outfits can be worn by men or women and have various levels of formality from work-wear to very expensive formal attire. The outfits consist of tight, decorated pants or a long skirt, short jackets, silk ties and are often worn with a wide-brimmed [[sombrero]] and other accessories as appropriate.

== History ==
The origins of the charro outfit may be traced back to [[Salamanca]] of the [[16th century]].&lt;ref name="Survives" /&gt; Spanish [[Conquistador|conquistadors]] brought this type of clothing with them to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22994922/|title=Just What Is a Charro?

The word ''charro'' was a derogatory term, originally meant to indicate their class status.{{Sfn|Márquez|2018|p=35-36}}

After the [[Mexican Revolution]], the imagery of the charro became important to Mexican culture.{{Sfn|Conway|2017|p=69}} Mexican president, [[Porfirio Díaz]], influenced [[mariachi]] performers to adopt the charro costume in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betz|first=Virginia Marie|date=1995|editor-last=Sands|editor-first=Kathleen Mullen|title=On the History of the Mexican Charro: A Review Essay|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40169936|journal=Journal of the Southwest|volume=37|issue=3|pages=512|registration=yes|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Magic"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://magazine.ucla.edu/features/the-magic-of-mariachi/|title=The Magic of Mariachi|last=Marquez|first=Letisia|date=1 October 2013|work=UCLA Magazine|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mariachi musicians would accompany [[ranchera]] singers starting in the 1930s and in the 1940s ranchera musicians adopted the charro suit.&lt;ref name="Magic" /&gt;{{Sfn|Conway|2017|p=71}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3454">A '''clock chime''' is a melody or a set of melodies played at intervals upon a set of bells to mark the passage of time.  It is also the name of such a set of bells when they are not part of a larger bell instrument such as a [[carillon|carillon]].  It is distinct from the striking of the hour by a single bell, although a clock that plays a clock chime normally plays the associated hour strike as well, while the hour bell may or may not have a part in the melodies.  The bells used to play clock chimes are most commonly located in [[bell tower|bell towers]] or [[grandfather clock|grandfather clocks]], but may be found in other places as well.  A variety of melodies exist, many associated with a particular location or bell tower that originated them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Compilation of Clock Chimes &amp; Sequences|url=http://www.nawcc.org/images/stories/2010/articles/2015/415/415_267_277.pdf |date=May 2015 |publisher=NAWCC Watch &amp; Clock Bulletin |accessdate=December 26, 2016 |author=Mallory, Steven R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==

The practice of using bells to mark time dates at least to the time of the early [[Christian church]], which used bells to mark the "canonical hours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bells: their history, legends, making, and uses |url=https://archive.org/stream/bellstheirhistor00cole/bellstheirhistor00cole_djvu.txt |date=1928 |publisher=Rand, McNally &amp; Company |accessdate=December 26, 2016 |author=Coleman, Satis Narrona}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An 8th-century Archbishop of York gave his priests instructions to sound church bells at certain times, and by the 10th century [[Saint Dunstan]] had written an extensive guide to bell-ringing to mark the canonical hours.&lt;ref name="bellsofengland"&gt;{{cite web |title=Church Bells of England |url=https://archive.org/stream/churchbellsofeng00walt#page/12/mode/2up |page=13 |date=1928 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=December 26, 2016 |author=Walters, Henry Beauchamp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry Beauchamp Walters' "Bells of England" features an entire chapter devoted to the regional variation in what bells were rung, how often, and what events they signaled throughout medieval England.

It is from these practices that clock chimes seem to have eventually emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Loudspeaker on the Tower|url=http://www.davidtinapple.com/illich/2000_loudsppu.pdf |date=2001 |accessdate=December 26, 2016 |author=Ilich, Ivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clock towers that chimed on the hour appeared in Italy by the 13th century,&lt;ref name="bellsofengland-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Church Bells of England |url=https://archive.org/stream/churchbellsofeng00walt#page/12/mode/2up |page=173 |date=1928 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=December 26, 2016 |author=Walters, Henry Beauchamp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were common enough by the 15th that in 1463 the Englishman John Baret willed funds to the sexton of St. Mary's Church so that he would "keep the clock, take heed to the chimes, [and] wind up the pegs and the plummets as often as need is". &lt;ref name="bellsofengland-3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Church Bells of England |url=https://archive.org/stream/churchbellsofeng00walt#page/12/mode/2up |page=111 |date=1928 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=December 26, 2016 |author=Walters, Henry Beauchamp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Council for Art Education, Inc. (CFAE)''' is an organization created by the [[Art &amp; Creative Materials Institute, Inc.]] (ACMI) in 1984 to promote March as [[Youth Art Month]], which was designed to promote [[art education]].  As of 2009, CFAE consisted of representatives of: ACMI, the [[National Art Education Association]], "The SHIP" (a group of [[manufacturers]] of [[art materials]]), and the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]].  The organization sponsors an annual competition called "School Flag Across the U.S....Flying High", where [[students]] are encouraged to design their own [[flags]], and the winning flag is flown in [[Washington, D.C.]] throughout Youth Art Month.  CFAE is currently [[headquartered]] in [[Hanson, Massachusetts]].

[[File:British Museum -Dunstable Swan Jewel -side cropped close.jpg|thumb|The Dunstable Swan Jewel, a [[livery badge]], about 1400. British Museum]]

The '''Dunstable Swan Jewel''' is a gold and [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] brooch in the form of a [[swan]] made in England or France in about 1400 and now in the [[British Museum]], where it is on display in Room 40.&lt;ref&gt;BM Highlights&lt;/ref&gt;  It was excavated in 1965 on the site of [[Dunstable Friary]], and is presumed to have been intended as a [[livery badge]] given by an important figure to his supporters; the most likely candidate is probably the future [[Henry V of England]], who was [[Prince of Wales]] from 1399.

The jewel is a rare medieval example of the then recently developed and fashionable white opaque enamel used in ''en [[ronde bosse]]'' to almost totally encase an underlying gold form. It is invariably compared to the [[white hart]] badges worn by King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and the angels surrounding the [[Virgin Mary]] in the painted ''[[Wilton Diptych]]'' of around the same date, where the chains hang freely down.

The jewel is formed as a standing or walking [[mute swan]] "gorged" with a gold collar in the form of a royal crown with six ''[[fleur-de-lys]]'' tines. There is a gold chain terminating in a ring attached to the crown, and the swan has a pin and catch on its right side for fastening the brooch to clothes or a hat. The swan is 3.2&amp;nbsp;cm high and 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm wide, and the length of the chain is 8.2&amp;nbsp;cm.  The swan's body is in white enamel, its eyes are of black enamel, which also once covered the legs and feet, where only traces now remain. Tiny fragments of pink or red enamel remain on the beak.&lt;ref&gt;Stratford says "pink"; Cherry (2010), 26, says "red".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Livery badges==
{{details|Livery badge}}
{{double image|left|The Wilton Diptych (left).jpg|200|The Wilton Diptych (Right).jpg|200|The ''[[Wilton Diptych]]'' (c. 1395–99), showing [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and the angels wearing Richard's [[livery badge]] of the [[White Hart]].}}
The jewel is a unique survival of the most expensive form of [[Heraldic badge|livery badge]], otherwise only known from inventories and representations in paintings.&lt;ref&gt;BM Highlights&lt;/ref&gt;  These were badges in various forms made for a leading figure bearing his [[personal device]], and given to others who would demonstrate by wearing them that they were in some way his employees, [[retainer (medieval)|retainer]]s, allies or supporters.  They were especially common in England in the age of "[[bastard feudalism]]" from the mid-fourteenth century until about the end of the fifteenth century, a period of intense factional conflict which saw the deposition of Richard II and the [[Wars of the Roses]].&lt;ref&gt;Steane, 132-134&lt;/ref&gt;

A lavish badge like the jewel would only have been worn by the person whose device was represented, members of his family or important supporters, and possibly servants who were in regular very close contact with him.  However the jewel lacks the ultimate luxury of being set with gems, for example ruby eyes, like the gems on the lion pendants worn by [[Sir John Donne]] and his wife in their portraits by [[Hans Memling]], now in the [[National Gallery, London]],&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lorne, 380&lt;/ref&gt; and several examples listed on the 1397 treasure roll of Richard II. In the ''Wilton Diptych'', Richard's own badge has pearls on the antler tips, which the angels' badges lack.  The white hart in the badge on the Treasury Roll, which the painted one may have copied, had pearls and sat on a grass bed made of emeralds,&lt;ref&gt;Stratford, [http://www.history.ac.uk/richardII/misc.html Miscellaneous gold objects]&lt;/ref&gt; and a hart badge of Richard's inventoried in the possession of Duke [[Philip the Good]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] in 1435 was set with 22 pearls, two [[spinel]]s, two [[sapphire]]s, a ruby and a huge diamond.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Marian in Alexander &amp; Binski, 524&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheaper forms of badge were more widely distributed, sometimes very freely indeed, rather as modern political campaign buttons and tee-shirts are, though as in some modern countries wearing the wrong badge in the wrong place could lead to personal danger.  In 1483 King [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] ordered 13,000 [[fustian]] (cloth) badges with his emblem of a [[boar]] for the investiture of his son [[Edward of Middleham, Prince of Wales|Edward]] as Prince of Wales,&lt;ref&gt;Cherry (2003), 204&lt;/ref&gt; a huge number given the population at the time.  Other grades of boar badges that have survived are in lead, silver,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/archaeology/excavations_techniques/treasure_gallery_07.shtml BBC article on silver boar badge], which it appears was originally [[silver-gilt]]&lt;/ref&gt; and gilded copper high relief, the last found at Richard's home of [[Middleham Castle]] in Yorkshire, and very likely worn by one of his household when he was [[Duke of Gloucester]].&lt;ref&gt;Cherry (2003), 204; no. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Museum also has a flat lead swan badge with low relief, typical of the cheap metal badges which were similar to the [[pilgrim badge]]s that were also common in the period.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry (2003), 203; no. 68a&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:White Boar Pendant Norbury Church.jpg|thumb|left|The white boar badge of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] as pendant to a [[Yorkist]] [[livery collar]] on the [[tomb monument]] of Sir [[Ralph Fitzherbert]] (died 1483) in [[Norbury, Derbyshire]].]]

In 1377, when the young Richard II's highly unpopular uncle, [[John of Gaunt]], was Regent, one of his more than 200 retainers, Sir John Swinton, unwisely rode through London wearing Gaunt's badge on a [[livery collar]] (an innovation of Gaunt's, probably the [[Collar of Esses]]).  The mob attacked him, pulling him off his horse and the badge off him, and he had to be rescued by the mayor from suffering serious harm.&lt;ref&gt;Given-Wilson, 124. Steane, 132 for Gaunt's retinue.  See Stratford, [http://www.history.ac.uk/richardII/richardII.html Richard II's life and reign] for a concise account of the upheavals of his reign.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over twenty years later, after Gaunt's son [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] had deposed Richard, one of Richard's servants was imprisoned by Henry for continuing to wear Richard's livery badge.  Many of the large number of badges of various liveries recovered from the Thames in London were perhaps discarded hurriedly by retainers who found themselves impoliticly dressed at various times.&lt;ref&gt;Steane, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently beginning relatively harmlessly under [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in a context of [[tournament]]s and courtly celebrations, by the reign of his grandson, Richard II, the badges had become seen as a social menace, and were "one of the most protracted controversies of Richard's reign",&lt;ref&gt;Given-Wilson, 123. See also Castor's "Introduction" for a wider survey of the retainer issue and its recent historiography.&lt;/ref&gt; as they were used to denote the small private armies of retainers kept by lords, largely for the purpose of enforcing their lord's will on the less powerful in his area.  Though they were surely a symptom rather than a cause of both local baronial bullying and the disputes between the king and his uncles and other lords, Parliament repeatedly tried to curb the use of livery badges.&lt;ref&gt;Given-Wilson, 126&lt;/ref&gt; The issuing of badges by lords was attacked in the Parliament of 1384, and in 1388 they made the startling request that "all liveries called badges [''signes''], as well of our lord the king as of other lords ... shall be abolished",&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 117&lt;/ref&gt; because "those who wear them are flown with such insolent arrogance that they do not shrink from practising with reckless effrontery various kinds of extortion in the surrounding countryside ... and it is certainly the boldness inspired by these badges that makes them unafraid to do these things".&lt;ref&gt;Given-Wilson, 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard offered to give up his own badges, to the delight of the [[House of Commons of England]], but the [[House of Lords]] refused to give up theirs, and the matter was put off.  In 1390 it was ordered that no one below the rank of [[banneret]] should issue badges, and no one below the rank of [[esquire]] wear them.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 117&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was apparently quiet for a few years, but from 1397 Richard issued increasingly large numbers of badges to retainers who misbehaved (his "[[Cheshire archers]]" being especially notorious), and in the Parliament of 1399, after his deposition, several of his leading supporters were forbidden from issuing "badges of signs" again, and a statute was passed allowing only the king (now Henry IV) to issue badges, and only to those ranking as esquires and above, who were only to wear them in his presence.&lt;ref&gt;Given-Wilson, 126. For the Cheshire retinue, Castor, 10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end it took a determined campaign by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] to largely stamp out the use of livery badges by others than the king, and reduce them to things normally worn only by household servants.

==The swan as a badge==
[[File:Britishmuseumdunstableswanjewelfront.jpg|thumb|Another view]]
The widespread use of the swan as a badge largely derives from the legend of the [[Swan Knight]], today most familiar from [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]''.  A group of [[Old French]]  ''[[chansons de geste]]'' called the [[Crusade cycle]] had associated the legend with the ancestors of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] (d. 1100), the hero of the [[First Crusade]].  Although Godfrey had no legitimate issue, his family had many descendants among the aristocracy of Europe, many of whom made use of the swan in their [[heraldry]] or as a para-heraldic [[emblem]].  In England these included the important de Bohun family, which used the so-called [[Bohun swan]] as its heraldic badge;  after the marriage in 1380 of [[Mary de Bohun]] (d. 1394) to the future King [[Henry IV of England]], the swan became adopted by the [[House of Lancaster]], who continued to use it for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;Stratford; Cherry (2003), 204&lt;/ref&gt; The swan with the crown and chain is especially associated with Lancastrian use; it echoes the crown and chain of Richard II's white hart,&lt;ref&gt;BM database&lt;/ref&gt; which he began to use as a livery badge from 1390.  As well as several of his own white hart badges, Richard's treasure roll of 1397 also includes a swan badge with a gold chain, perhaps presented by one of his enemies mentioned above: "Item, a gold swan enamelled white with a little gold chain hanging around the neck, weighing 2 oz., value, 46s. 8d".&lt;ref&gt;Stratford&lt;/ref&gt;  He declared to Parliament that he had exchanged liveries with his uncles as a sign of amity at various moments of reconciliation.

After Henry seized the throne in 1399, the use of the swan emblem was transferred to his son, the future Henry V, who was made Prince of Wales at his father's coronation, and whose tomb in [[Westminster Abbey]] includes swans. It was also used by his grandson [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]] before his death in the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471.  In 1459 Edward's  mother [[Margaret of Anjou]] insisted that he give swan livery badges to "all the gentlemen of [[Cheshire]]"; the type and number are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry (2003), 205; he mistakenly calls Edward "Henry"&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also used by other families; the swan was the crest of the [[Earl of Warwick|Beauchamp]] [[Earls of Warwick]], leading supporters of the Lancastrian faction under [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick]] (d. 1401). [[Eleanor de Bohun]], Mary's sister, had in 1376 also married into the [[Plantagenet]] royal family, in the person of [[King Edward III of England]]'s youngest son, [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester]] (d. 1397), another prominent Lancastrian supporter, and the swan badge was used by his [[Baron Stafford|Stafford]] descendants. Mary and Eleanor were co-heiresses to huge Bohun estates, and disputes over the settlement of these continued until late into the next century, when most of their descendants had been killed in the Wars of the Roses, perhaps encouraging the continued assertion of Bohun ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Stratford&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]], a descendant of the Beauchamps, Eleanor de Bohun and Thomas of Woodstock, and John of Gaunt, used the swan with crown and chain as his own badge.  He was certainly active in trying to get the Bohun lands, and may well have also plotted to seize the throne, for which he was executed in 1483 by Richard III.

[[File:Stafford flag.png|left|thumb|Standard of [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]], about 1475, features the [[Stafford knot]] and Bohun swan badges.]]

==Place and date of manufacture==
Another user of swan insignia around 1400 was [[John, Duke of Berry]], the [[House of Valois|Valois]] prince who commissioned two of the most spectacular medieval works featuring white enamel ''en ronde bosse'', the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]], also in the British Museum, and the ''[[Goldenes Rössl]]''.  He has been considered as a possible commissioner of the jewel, in which case it would almost certainly have been made in Paris, and might have made its way to England after being presented.&lt;ref&gt;By John Cherry in his original article on the jewel in 1969. See Platt, 183, and Steane, 131. However Cherry's later, briefer, references do not mention this theory.&lt;/ref&gt;  This might also have been the case if it was commissioned by an English person, especially a royal one.  However, there are records of London goldsmiths producing white enamel works for the court, and a reliquary with many figures in white ''ronde bosse'' enamel and now in the [[Louvre]] may have been made in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp;jsessionid=M2xWS5VZpY5tGtcbfMGvLGDcvgG9GHFWvLTKXyGRlGJ5f9nd2Qtd!-163527394?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226033&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226033&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500778&amp;baseIndex=0&amp;bmLocale=en ''Tableau of the Trinity''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615184256/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp%3Bjsessionid%3DM2xWS5VZpY5tGtcbfMGvLGDcvgG9GHFWvLTKXyGRlGJ5f9nd2Qtd%21-163527394?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226033&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226033&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500778&amp;baseIndex=0&amp;bmLocale=en |date=2011-06-15 }} in the [[Louvre]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other small jewels have survived in England which may have been made in London, either by native goldsmiths or the foreign ones known to have worked there.&lt;ref&gt;Stratford&lt;/ref&gt;

No more precise date for the jewel than "around 1400" is given by experts;&lt;ref&gt;BM Highlights and collection database, all three Cherry works etc.&lt;/ref&gt; this might have a wider range than many works as style is not much help in dating here.  Given the royal collar of the swan, the marriage of the future Henry IV to Mary de Bohun probably provides the earliest possible date.  A date ''after'' Henry IV seized the throne in 1399—when his son would have been using the badge—is perhaps more likely. The difficult technique of adding elements in further colours was not perfected until about 1400, in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Tait, 26&lt;/ref&gt; Fixing a ''[[terminus ante quem]]'' is more difficult, but white enamel ''en ronde bosse'' became less fashionable after about the 1430s.&lt;ref&gt;Tait, 26&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there was no Prince of Wales between 1413, when Henry V succeeded to the throne, and 1454.

==History==
[[Dunstable]], where the ancient roads of [[Watling Street]] and the [[Icknield Way]] cross some thirty miles north of London, was frequently visited by the medieval elite. Apart from travellers passing through, tournaments were held there at least until the 1340s, and Lancastrian armies used it as a base in 1459 and 1461.&lt;ref&gt;Platt, 183&lt;/ref&gt;  The jewel was found in an excavation of the friary, in what seemed to be a deposit of rubble dating from the destruction of the buildings after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;  It would appear to have been above ground until that point.  However, it must have been overlooked—the scrap value of the gold itself would have prevented it from being merely discarded.&lt;ref&gt;BM database&lt;/ref&gt;  After its excavation, the jewel was bought by the British Museum in 1966 for £5,000, of which £666 was a grant from the [[Art Fund]] (then NACF);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfund.org/artwork/3723/the-dunstable-swan-jewel Art Fund page]&lt;/ref&gt; other contributions were made by the [[Pilgrim Trust]] and the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]].&lt;ref&gt;BM database&lt;/ref&gt; It is on display in Room 40.

'''''Dzala ertobashia''''' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: ძალა ერთობაშია, {{small|pronounced}} {{IPAc-ka|dz|a|l|a|_|e|r|t|o|b|a|sh|i|a}}, "Strength is in Unity") is the official motto of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

[[Image:Greater coat of arms of Georgia.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of Georgia]]
It originally comes from a famous [[fable]] by [[Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani]] of the same name. According to this fable, once upon a time there lived a king with thirty sons. One day, when he was dying, he called his sons and asked them to bring arrows. Then king asked them to break the arrows one by one, and the sons did. The king then asked them to break the arrows all at once, and they could not. The king said: "Teach O my sons from this fact, that there is ''‘strength in unity.’'' If you are together, an enemy cannot do you wrong, but if you are divided, victory will be on their side."

The problem of unity is very real for the Georgian state, and thus was likely a factor in the decision to make the phrase the national motto.

Versions of this phrase are the [[national motto]]s of [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Haiti]], and also formerly in the historical [[South African Republic|Traansvaal]], apartheid-era [[South Africa]] (as ''[[Ex Unitate Vires]]''), and [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]. There is a popular legend in Bulgaria about [[Kubrat]], ruler of [[Great Bulgaria]], who also gave his sons the same advice by the same example.

'''''Economic Development and Cultural Change (EDCC)''''' publishes studies that use modern [[theoretical]] and [[empirical]] approaches to examine both the determinants and the effects of various dimensions of [[economic development]] and [[cultural change]]. It covers all aspects of the [[economics]] of [[developing country|developing countries]], including [[education reform]], [[immigration]], [[debt bondage]], [[ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[redistribution of wealth|land redistribution]], and [[economic development]] and [[culture|cultural change]]. ''EDCC''’s focus is on empirical papers with analytic underpinnings, concentrating on micro-level [[evidence]], that use appropriate data to test theoretical models and explore [[policy]] impacts related to [[economic development]].

The major founder of the journal was [[Bert F. Hoselitz]] who served as editor from 1952 until 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/950309/hoselitz.shtml Obituary: Bert Hoselitz, Economics]. ''The University of Chicago Chronicle'', 14:13; March 9, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The journal was established at the [[University of Chicago]]'s Center for Research on Economic Development and Cultural Change. The Center's board and the journal's founders took the view that [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary research]] would be required to understand issues of economic development.

'''Fis phenomenon''' is a phenomenon of child [[language acquisition]] that demonstrates that perception of [[phoneme]]s occurs earlier than the ability of the child to produce those phonemes.  It is also illustrative of a larger theme in child language acquisition: that skills in [[language comprehension|linguistic comprehension]] generally precede corresponding skills in [[language production|linguistic production]].

The name comes from an incident reported in 1960 by [[Jean Berko Gleason|J. Berko]] and [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|R. Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Psycholinguistic Research Methods | author = [[Jean Berko Gleason|J. Berko]] and [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|R.

However, when adults asked him, "Is this your ''fis''?" he rejected the statement. When he was asked, "Is this your fish?" he responded, "Yes, my fis."   This shows that although the child could not produce the phoneme {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, he could perceive it as being different from the phoneme {{IPA|/s/}}. 
In some cases, the sounds produced by the child are actually acoustically different, but not significantly enough for others to distinguish&lt;ref&gt;[[Victoria Fromkin|Fromkin]], V. (Ed.) (2000).

In [[architecture]],  a '''gargoyle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɑr|ɡ|ɔɪ|l}}) is a carved or formed [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesque]]&lt;ref name="Benton 1997" /&gt;{{rp|6–8}} with a spout designed to convey water from a roof and away from the side of a building, thereby preventing rainwater from running down [[masonry]] walls and eroding the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] between. Architects often used multiple gargoyles on a building to divide the flow of rainwater off the roof to minimize the potential damage from a rainstorm. A trough is cut in the back of the gargoyle and rainwater typically exits through the open mouth. Gargoyles are usually an elongated fantastical animal because the length of the gargoyle determines how far water is directed from the wall. When [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[flying buttress]]es were used, [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] were sometimes cut into the buttress to divert water over the aisle walls.&lt;ref name="Wonderopolis"&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is a Gargoyle? |url=https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/what-is-a-gargoyle |website=Wonderopolis |accessdate=19 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term originates from the [[French language|French]] ''gargouille,'' which in English is likely to mean "throat" or is otherwise known as the "gullet";&lt;ref name="Hargreaves 1990 p. 51" /&gt;&lt;ref name="American Heritage Dictionary" /&gt; cf. [[Latin]] ''gurgulio, gula, gargula'' ("gullet" or "throat") and similar words derived from the root ''gar,'' "to swallow", which represented the gurgling sound of water (e.g., [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''garganta,'' "throat"; ''gárgola,'' "gargoyle"). It is also connected to the French verb ''gargariser,'' which shares a Latin root with the verb "gargle"&lt;ref name="Benton 1997" /&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary" /&gt; and is likely imitative in origin.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 2015" /&gt; The [[Italian language|Italian]] word for gargoyle is ''doccione'' or ''gronda sporgente,''  an architecturally precise phrase which means "protruding gutter. (Italian also uses ''gargolla'' o ''garguglia'', when it has a grotesque shape)

When not constructed as a waterspout and only serving an ornamental or artistic function, the correct term for such a sculpture is a [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesque]], chimera, or [[Boss (architecture)|boss]]. There are also regional variations, such as the [[hunky punk]]. Just as with bosses and chimeras, gargoyles are said to frighten off and protect those that it guards, such as a church, from any evil or harmful spirits.

== Legend of the Gargouille ==
A French legend that sprang up around the name of [[Romanus of Rouen|St. Romanus]] ({{lang-fr|Romain}}; [[floruit|fl.]] {{Circa}} 631 – 641 AD), the former chancellor of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] king [[Clotaire II]] who was made [[bishop of Rouen]], relates how he delivered the country around Rouen from a monster called ''[[Gargouille]]'' or ''Goji''.&lt;ref name="Butler Thurston Attwater 1956 p. 183" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herbermann Pace Pallen Shahan 1913 p. 209" /&gt;  La Gargouille is said to have been the typical dragon with bat-like wings, a long neck, and the ability to breathe fire from its mouth.  Multiple versions of the story are given, either that St. Romanus subdued the creature with a crucifix, or he captured the creature with the help of the only volunteer, a condemned man. In each, the monster is led back to Rouen and burned, but its head and neck would not burn due to being tempered by its own fire breath. The head was then mounted on the walls of the newly built church to scare off evil spirits, and used for protection.&lt;ref name="Cipa 2009" /&gt; In commemoration of St. Romain, the Archbishops of Rouen were granted the right to set a prisoner free on the day that the [[reliquary]] of the saint was carried in procession (see details at [[Rouen]]).&lt;ref name="Hodder 1881 p. 46" /&gt;&lt;ref name="British Archaeological Association 1939 p. 361" /&gt;

== History ==
The term ''gargoyle'' is most often applied to [[medieval]] work, but throughout all ages, some means of water diversion, when not conveyed in gutters, was adopted. In [[Ancient Egypt]]ian architecture, gargoyles showed little variation, typically in the form of a lion's head.&lt;ref name="Clarke Engelbach 1930" /&gt; Similar lion-mouthed water spouts were also seen on [[Greek temple]]s, carved or modelled in the [[marble sculpture|marble]] or [[terracotta]] [[cymatium]] of the [[cornice (architecture)|cornice]].&lt;ref name="Dinsmoor Anderson 1950" /&gt; An excellent example of this are the 39 remaining lion-headed water spouts on the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]].  Originally, it had 102 gargoyles or spouts, but due to the heavy weight (they were crafted from marble), many snapped off and had to be replaced.&lt;ref name="Willemsen 1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swaddling 1980" /&gt;

Many medieval cathedrals included gargoyles and chimeras.&lt;ref name="Fudgé 2016 p. 91" /&gt; According to French architect and author [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], himself one of the great producers of gargoyles in the 19th century,&lt;ref name="Hourihane 2012 p. 642" /&gt; the earliest known medieval gargoyles appear on [[Laon Cathedral]] c. 1200–1220.&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2016 p. 248" /&gt; One of the more famous examples is the gargoyles of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. Although most have grotesque features, the term gargoyle has come to include all types of images. Some gargoyles were depicted as monks, or combinations of real animals and people, many of which were humorous. Unusual animal mixtures, or chimeras, did not act as rainspouts and are more properly called grotesques. They serve as ornamentation but are now popularly called gargoyles.

Both ornamented and unornamented water spouts projecting from roofs at parapet level were a common device used to shed rainwater from buildings until the early 18th century. From that time, more and more buildings used drainpipes to carry the water from the [[Rain gutter|guttering]] roof to the ground and only very few buildings using gargoyles were constructed.  This was because some people found them frightening, and sometimes heavy ones fell off, causing damage. In 1724, the London Building Act passed by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] made the use of downpipes compulsory on all new construction.&lt;ref name="Holy Horrors" /&gt;

== Catholic Church ==
The primary use of the gargoyle was to illustrate [[evil]] through the form of the gargoyle,{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} while another theory posits that grotesques in architecture were [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] devices.&lt;ref name="Tschen-Emmons 2015 p. 72" /&gt; In the 12th century, before the use of gargoyles as rainspouts, [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard of Clairvaux]] was famous for speaking out against gargoyles carved on the walls of his monastery's cloister:&lt;ref name="Di Renzo 1995 p. 1" /&gt;

{{quotation|What are these fantastic monsters doing in the cloisters before the eyes of the brothers as they read? What is the meaning of these unclean monkeys, these strange savage lions, and monsters? To what purpose are here placed these creatures, half beast, half man, or these spotted tigers? I see several bodies with one head and several heads with one body. Here is a quadruped with a serpent's head, there a fish with a quadruped's head, then again an animal half horse, half goat... Surely if we do not blush for such absurdities, we should at least regret what we have spent on them.&lt;ref name="Leclercq 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nathan 1961 p. 74" /&gt;
}}
According to Lester Burbank Bridaham, writing in ''Gargoylaes, Chimeres and the Grotesque in French Gothic Sculpture'', "There is much symbolism in the sculpture of the Gothic period; but we must be wary of reading in too much meaning."&lt;ref name="Bridaham 1930 p. xii" /&gt;
{{Clear}}

== Animal ==
The [[ancient Egypt]]ians, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] all used animal-shaped waterspouts.&lt;ref name="Benton 1997" /&gt;{{rp|11}} During the 12th Century, when gargoyles appeared in Europe, the Roman Catholic Church was growing stronger and converting many new people.  Most of the population at this time was illiterate, so images were very important to convey ideas.  Many early gargoyles depicted some version of a dragon, especially in France.  In addition to serving as spouts for water, the gaping mouths of these gargoyles evoked the fearsome destructiveness of these legendary beasts, reminding the laity of the need for the church's protection.&lt;ref name="Varner 2008" /&gt;

Human qualities were sometimes ascribed to specific animals—that is, the animals were [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]]. This was especially common for pagans, and using these ideas helped conversion to Catholicism. Some animals (such as the [[rhinoceros]] and the [[hippopotamus]]) were unknown in western Europe during the Middle Ages, so gargoyles of these species (such as the ones at [[Laon Cathedral]]) are modern gargoyles and therefore did not have symbolic meaning in Medieval times.&lt;ref name="Benton 1997" /&gt;{{rp|20}}

'''A generative theory of tonal music''' (GTTM) is a theory of music&lt;ref&gt;Lerdahl, Fred/Jackendoff, Ray (1983): ''A Generative Theory of Tonal Music'', Cambridge, Mass.: [[MIT Press]], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; conceived by American composer and music theorist [[Fred Lerdahl]] and American linguist [[Ray Jackendoff]] and presented in the 1983 book of the same title. It constitutes a "formal description of the musical intuitions of a listener who is experienced in a musical idiom"&lt;ref&gt;Lerdahl, Fred/Jackendoff, Ray (1983): ''A Generative Theory of Tonal Music'', Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of illuminating the unique human capacity for musical understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Lerdahl, Fred and Ray Jackendoff (1983). ''A generative theory of tonal music''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The collaboration between Lerdahl and Jackendoff was inspired by [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s 1973 [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] at Harvard University, wherein he called for researchers to uncover a musical grammar that could explain the human musical mind in a scientific manner comparable to [[Noam Chomsky]]'s revolutionary [[transformational grammar|transformational]] or [[generative grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1957). ''Syntactic Structures''. The Hague: Mouton; Chomsky, Noam (1965). ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Chomsky, Noam (1966). ''Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar''. The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the major methodologies of music analysis that preceded it, GTTM construes the mental procedures under which the listener constructs an unconscious understanding of music, and uses these tools to illuminate the structure of individual compositions. The theory has been influential, spurring further work by its authors and other researchers in the fields of [[music theory]], [[music cognition]] and [[cognitive musicology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackendoff, Ray (1987). ''Consciousness and the Computational Mind''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Temperley, David (2001). ''The Cognition of Basic Musical Structures''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Lerdahl, Fred (2001). ''Tonal Pitch Space''. New York: Oxford University Press; Lerdahl, F., &amp; R. Jackendoff (2006). The Capacity for Music: What Is It, and What's Special About It? ''Cognition'', 100.1, 33–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The theory==

GTTM focuses on four hierarchical systems that shape our musical intuitions. Each of these systems is expressed in a strict hierarchical structure where dominant regions contain smaller subordinate elements and equal elements exist contiguously within a particular and explicit hierarchical level. In GTTM any level can be small-scale or large-scale depending on the size of its elements.

===The structures===

====I. Grouping structure====

GTTM considers grouping analysis to be the most basic component of musical understanding. It expresses a hierarchical segmentation of the piece into motives, phrases, periods and still larger sections.

====II. Metrical structure====

Metrical structure expresses the intuition that the events of a piece are related to a regular alternation of strong and weak beats at a number of hierarchical levels. It is a crucial basis for all the structures and reductions of GTTM.

====III. Time-span reduction====

Time-span reductions (TSRs) are based on information gleaned from metrical and grouping structures. They establish [[tree structure]]-style hierarchical organizations uniting time-spans at all temporal levels of a work.&lt;ref&gt;Their function is double: they establish tree structure relations (time-span trees), and they provide rhythmic criteria to supplement pitch criteria that determine the structural importance of events (p. 119).&lt;/ref&gt;  The TSR analysis begins at the smallest levels, where metrical structure marks off the music into beats of equal length (or more precisely into attack points separated by uniform time-spans&lt;ref&gt;A time-span is a length of time spanning from one metrical event up to, but not including, the next event. (This is the minimal condition on time-spans.)&lt;/ref&gt;) and moves through all larger levels where grouping structure divides the music into motives, phrases, periods, theme groups and still greater divisions. It further specifies a “head” (or most structurally important event) for each time-span at all hierarchical levels of the analysis. A completed TSR analysis is often called a time-span tree.

====IV. Prolongational reduction====

Prolongational reduction (PR) provides our "psychological" awareness of tensing and relaxing patterns in a given piece with precise structural terms. In time-span reduction, the hierarchy of less and more important events is established according to rhythmic stability. In prolongational reduction, hierarchy is concerned with relative stability expressed in terms of continuity and progression, the movement toward tension or relaxation, and the degree of closure or non-closure.  A PR analysis also produces a tree-structure style hierarchical analysis, but this information is often conveyed in a visually condensed modified "slur" notation.

The need for prolongational reduction mainly arises from two limitations of time-span reductions. The first is that time-span reduction fails to express the sense of continuity produced by harmonic rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;Harmonic rhythm is the pattern of durations produced by changes in the harmony at the musical surface.&lt;/ref&gt; The second is that time-span reduction—even though it establishes that particular pitch-events are heard in relation to a particular beat, within a particular group—fails to say anything about how music flows across these segments.&lt;ref&gt;F. Lerdahl and R. Jackendoff (1983). ''The generative theory of tonal music''. p.122&lt;/ref&gt;

===More on TSR vs. PR===

It is helpful to note some basic differences between a time-span tree produced by TSR and a prolongational tree produced by PR. First, though the basic branching divisions produced by the two trees are often the same or similar at high structural levels, branching variations between the two trees are often observed as one travels further down towards the musical surface.

A second and equally important differentiation is that a prolongational tree carries three types of branching: strong prolongation (represented by an open node at the branching point), weak prolongation (represented by a filled node at the branching point) and progression (represented by simple branching, with no node). Time-span trees do not make this distinction. All time-span trees branches are simple branches without nodes. (Although time-span tree branches are often annotated with other helpful comments.)

==The rules==

Each of the four major hierarchical organizations (grouping structure, metrical structure, time-span reduction and prolongational reduction) is established through rules, which are divided into three categories:

#The well-formedness rules, which specify possible structural descriptions.
#The preference rules, which draw on possible structural descriptions eliciting those descriptions that correspond to experienced listeners’ hearings of any particular piece.
#The transformational rules, which provide a means of associating distorted structures with well-formed descriptions.

===I. Grouping structure rules===

====Grouping well-formedness rules (G~WFRs)====

#"Any contiguous sequence of pitch-events, drum beats, or the like can constitute a group, and only contiguous sequences can constitute a group."
#"A piece constitutes a group."
#"A group may contain smaller groups."
#"If a group G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; contains part of a group G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it must contain all of G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;."
#'If a group G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; contains a smaller group G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; must be exhaustively partitioned into smaller groups."

====Grouping preference rules (G~PRs)====

#"Avoid analyses with very small groups  – the smaller, the less preferable."
#(Proximity) Consider a sequence of four notes, n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – n&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the transition n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; may be heard as a group boundary if: a.(slur/rest) the interval of time from the end of n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than that from the end of n1 to the beginning of n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that from the end of n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to the beginning of n&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or if b.(attack/point) the interval of time between the attack point of n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than that between the attack points of n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that between the attack points of n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
#(Change) Consider a sequence of four notes, n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – n&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the transition n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; may be heard as a group boundary if marked by a. register, b. dynamics, c. articulation, d. length.
#(Intensification) "Where the effects pick out by a GPRs 2 and 3 are relatively more pronounced, a larger-level group may be placed."
#(Symmetry)  "Prefer grouping analyses that most closely approach the ideal subdivision of groups into two parts of equal length."
#(Parallelism) "Where two or more segments of music can be construed as parallel, they preferably form parallel parts of groups."
#(Time-span and prolongational stability) "Prefer a grouping structure that results in more stable time-span and/or prolongational reductions."

====Transformational grouping rules====

#Grouping overlap (p.&amp;nbsp;60).
#Grouping elision (p.&amp;nbsp;61).

===II. Metrical structure rules===

====Metrical well-formedness rules (M~WFRs)====

#"Every attack point must be associated with a beat at the smallest metrical level present at that point in the piece."
#"Every beat at a given level must also be a beat at all smaller levels present at that point in that piece."
#"At each metrical level, strong beats are spaced either two or three beats apart."
#"The tactus and immediately larger metrical levels must consist of beats equally spaced throughout the piece. At subtactus metrical levels, weak beats must be equally spaced between the surrounding strong beats."

====Metrical preference rules (M~PRs)====

#(Parallelism) "Where two or more groups or parts of groups can be construed as parallel, they preferably receive parallel metrical structure."
#(Strong beat early) "Weakly prefer a metrical structure in which the strongest beat in a group appears relatively early in the group."
#(Event) "Prefer a metrical structure in which beats of level L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; that coincide with the inception of pitch-events are strong beats of L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;."
#(Stress) "Prefer a metrical structure in which beats of level L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; that are stressed are strong beats of L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;."
#(Length) Prefer a metrical structure in which a relatively strong beat occurs at the inception of either relatively long: a. pitch-event; b. duration of a dynamic; c. slur; d. pattern of articulation; e. duration of a pitch in the relevant levels of the time-span reduction; f. duration of a harmony in the relevant levels of the time-span reduction (harmonic rhythm).
#(Bass) "Prefer a metrically stable bass."
#(Cadence) "Strongly prefer a metrical structure in which cadences are metrically stable; that is, strongly avoid violations of local preference rules within cadences."
#(Suspension) "Strongly prefer a metrical structure in which a suspension is on a stronger beat than its resolution."
#(Time-span interaction) "Prefer a metrical analysis that minimizes conflict in the time-span reduction."
#(Binary regularity) "Prefer metrical structures in which at each level every other beat is strong."

====Transformational metrical rule====

#Metrical deletion (p.&amp;nbsp;101).

===III. Time-span reduction rules===

Time-span reduction rules begin with two segmentation rules and proceed to the standard WFRs, PRs and TRs.

====Time-span segmentation rules====

#"Every group in a piece is a time-span in the time-span segmentation of the piece."
#"In underlying grouping structure: a. each beat B of the smallest metrical level determines a time-span T&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; extending from B up to but not including the next beat of the smallest level; b. each beat B of metrical level Li determines a regular time-span of all beats of level L&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt; from B up to but not including (i) the next beat B’ of level L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; or (ii) a group boundary, whichever comes sooner; and c. if a group boundary G intervenes between B and the preceding beat of the same level, B determines an augmented time-span T’&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the interval from G to the end of the regular time-span T&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;."

====Time-span reduction well-formedness rules (TSR~WFRs)====

#"For every time-span T there is an event e (or a sequence of events e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that is the head of T."
#"If T does not contain any other time-span (that is, if T is the smallest level of time-spans), there e is whatever event occurs in T."
#If T contains other time-spans, let T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be the (regular or augmented) time-spans immediately contained in T and let e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be their respective heads. Then the head is defined depending on: a. ordinary reduction; b. fusion; c. transformation; d. cadential retention (p.&amp;nbsp;159).
#"If a two-element cadence is directly subordinate to the head e of a time-span T, the final is directly subordinate to e and the penult is directly subordinate to the final."

====Time-span reduction preference rules (TSR~PRs)====

#(Metrical position) "Of the possible choices for head of time-span T, prefer that is in a relatively strong metrical position."
#(Local harmony) "Of the possible choices for head of time-span T, prefer that is: a. relatively intrinsically consonant, b. relatively closely related to the local tonic."
#(Registral extremes) "Of the possible choices for head of time-span T, weakly prefer a choice that has: a. a higher melodic pitch; b. a lower bass pitch."
#(Parallelism) "If two or more time-spans can be construed as motivically and/or rhythmically parallel, preferably assign them parallel heads."
#(Metrical stability) "In choosing the head of a time-span T, prefer a choice that results in more stable choice of metrical structure."
#(Prolongational stability) "In choosing the head of a time-span T, prefer a choice that results in more stable choice of prolongational structure."
#(Cadential retention) (p.&amp;nbsp;170).
#(Structural beginning) "If for a time-span T there is a larger group G containing T for which the head of T can function as the structural beginning, then prefer as head of T an event relatively close to the beginning of T (and hence to the beginning of G as well)."
#"In choosing the head of a piece, prefer the structural ending to the structural beginning."

===IV. Prolongational reduction rules===

====Prolongational reduction well-formedness rules (PR~WFRs)====

#"There is a single event in the underlying grouping structure of every piece that functions as prolongational head."
#"An event e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; can be a direct elaboration of another pitch e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; in any of the following ways: a. e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a strong prolongation of e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; if the roots, bass notes, and melodic notes of the two events are identical; b. e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a weak prolongation of e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; if the roots of the two events are identical but the bass and/or melodic notes differ; c. e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a progression to or from e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; if the harmonic roots of the two events are different."
#"Every event in the underlying grouping structure is either the prolongational head or a recursive elaboration of the prolongational head."
#(No crossing branches) "If an event e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a direct elaboration of an event e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, every event between e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; must be a direct elaboration of either e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, or some event between them."

====Prolongational reduction preference rules (PR~PRs)====

#(Time-span importance) "In choosing the prolongational most important event e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; of a prolongational region (e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;), strongly prefer a choice in which e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is relatively time-span important."
#(Time-span segmentation) "Let e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; be the prolongationally most important region (e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;). If there is a time-span that contains e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; but not e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, prefer a prolongational reduction in which e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is an elaboration of e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;; similarly with the roles of e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; reversed."
#(Prolongational connection) "In choosing the prolongationally most important  region (e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;), prefer an e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; that attaches to as to form a maximally stable prolongational connections with one of the endpoints of the region."
#(Prolongational importance) "Let e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; be the prolongationally most important region (e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;). Prefer a prolongational reduction in which e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is an elaboration of the prolongationally more important of the endpoints."
#(Parallelism) "Prefer a prolongational reduction in which parallel passages receive parallel analyses."
#(Normative prolongational structure) "A cadenced group preferably contains four (five) elements in its prolongational structure: a. a prolongational beginning; b. a prolongational ending consisting of one element of the cadences; (c. a right-branching prolongational as the most important direct elaboration direct of the prolongational beginning); d. a right-branching progression as the (next) most important direct elaboration of the prolongational beginning; e. a left-branching ‘subdominant’ progression as the most important elaboration of the first element of the cadence."

====Prolongational reduction transformational rules====

#Stability conditions for prolongational connection (p. 224): a. Branching condition; b. Pitch-collection condition; c. Melodic Condition; d. Harmonic Condition.

[[File:Getai stage, Singapore - 20120124.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Getais are popular among residents in Singapore, as they are held only occasionally.]]
A '''getai''' (literally song stage) ([[Simplified Chinese]]: 歌台), is a usually boisterous live stage performance held during the [[Ghost Festival]] commonly held in [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and some parts of [[Indonesia]] (mainly in [[Riau]], [[Riau Islands]] and [[North Sumatra]]), in contrast to the generally solemn mood of the festival.  However the performance is also routinely played at other Chinese festivals. The stage setup is usually composed of temporary structures and situated in the suburbs of the city in any empty field or even in parking spaces or housing estate.

In the past, performances were usually of Chinese operas or puppet shows. The performances are meant to be for the spirits but also for people during the seventh month. With the decline of Chinese opera and traditional puppet shows, the performances evolved to become what is known today as Getai.

Younger people in Singapore may relate to Getai as [[kitsch]], while older people enjoy dancing and singing along to familiar songs, often in [[Min Nan|Hokkien]].&lt;ref name=invade/&gt; Traditional singers such as Liu Lingling tend to dress conservatively, while young performers drawn to getai may choose more revealing outfits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaone.com/News/The%2BNew%2BPaper/Story/A1Story20090707-153416.html Getai: Sexy, not sleazy], ''The New Paper'', July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The backdrop of the stage is usually made of cardboard and clothes painted in bright colours, vibrantly illuminated by coloured spotlights. The performers normally don loud and glittery clothing.&lt;ref name=invade&gt;[http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20090823-162756.html Foreigners invade getai], ''The Straits Times'', Aug 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some compères{{clarify|date=January 2013}} indulge in crude humour; others maintain a quick-witted dialogue, joking about local and current affairs, sometimes switching between Mandarin, local Chinese dialects, and even English and Indian languages.

Getai has been increasingly accepted and celebrated by the mainstream media. Royston Tan's 2007 movie ''[[881 (film)|881]]'' is based on a pair of getai singers. The ''Straits Times's'' social networking and citizen journalism portal STOMP holds the Getai Awards annually to honour popular getai artists.&lt;ref&gt;"STOMP honours getai artists". ''The Straits Times.'' July 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; These artists are selected via voting by the general public.

==History==
''Getai'' emerged in Singapore in the years of Japanese occupation in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJTJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Chinese Entertainment|editor= Kwok-Bun Chan |page=24 |authors= Chan Kwok-bun and Yun Sai-shing |year=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317977995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An early ''getai'' was built in Weiyang Gong in the [[New World Amusement Park]], however it was bombed by the Japanese and a new stage Gongkai Tai was built.  The early ''getai'' performed mostly songs. Later dancing, drama and acrobatics were also added by performers from ''gewutuan'' (歌舞团 or song-and-dance troupes), another kind of entertainment show that had begun to decline in popularity by that time. ''Getai'' became increasing popular, and by the 1950s, there were 4 ''getai'' stages in the New World,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJTJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Chinese Entertainment|editor= Kwok-Bun Chan |page=26 |authors= Chan Kwok-bun and Yun Sai-shing |year=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317977995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other ''getai'' were also set up in other amusement parks.

''Getai'' in amusement parks declined in popularity in the late 1950s and began to be closed in the 1960s. It had however become established by the 1970s as popular entertainment on makeshift stages set-up along streets and in other public spaces during [[Ghost Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2015-02-25_161203.html |title=Getai |work=Singapore infopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more recent years, ''getai'' has also been organized for other Chinese festivals, such as the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]]. [[Resorts World Sentosa]]'s casino included getai in its 2010 [[Chinese New Year]] celebrations.&lt;ref name=notpantang&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.relax.com.sg/relax/news/328964/_Getai_not_pantang_.html |title=Getai not pantang |work=The New Paper |date= March 1, 2010 |publisher = AsiaOne |accessdate= 2010-10-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305123536/http://www.relax.com.sg/relax/news/328964/_Getai_not_pantang_.html |archivedate=March 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Loyang Tua Pek Kong Temple arranged ''getai'' for the 2010 Mid-Autumn celebrations.

[[File:Getai performance in Singapore - 20060325.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Getai in 2006]]

A groundbreaking ''getai'' was held in 2006. This was a twelve-hour marathon ''getai'' that saw many famous performers gracing the stage and bringing the crowd to their feet. The organiser was Peter Loh, a veteran in the getai scene. The marathon was a one-of-a-kind and it really awed the whole of Singapore.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}  2011 was another milestone when getai performances were held at Orchard Road for the first time. And the stage design and sound system have major changes throughout the years.

In 2015, Singapore Mediacorp Channel 8 held a competition for ''getai'' singers called ''[[GeTai Challenge]]'' (歌台星力量).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.toggle.sg/en/channel8/shows/getai-challenge |title=GETAI CHALLENGE 歌台星力量 |publisher=Mediacorp Pte Ltd. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722070941/http://tv.toggle.sg/en/channel8/shows/getai-challenge |archivedate=2015-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show run for two seasons with the most [[GeTai Challenge 2018|recent season]] premiered on April 20, 2018 and ended on August 10, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zaobao.com.sg/zentertainment/movies-and-tv/story20180810-882224|title=抗癌成功首参赛 刘心玲《歌台星力量兴旺发》决赛夺冠|publisher=zaobao.com.sg|date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Government Seal of Bangladesh''' ({{lang-bn|বাংলাদেশ সরকারের সীল - Bānglādēś sarkārēr sīl}}) used by the [[Cabinet of Bangladesh]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/index.php?option=com_weblinks&amp;task=ministry&amp;Itemid=152&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Government of Bangladesh]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/state.html&lt;/ref&gt; on official documents.

One version is used on the cover page of [[Bangladeshi passport]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dip.gov.bd&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Seal features the same design elements as the first [[Flag of Bangladesh]] in a circular setting. The outer white ring is shown with the caption of the official name of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: ''গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ সরকার'' with 4 red 5-pointed stars. In centre the country map on a red disc.

==History==
The seal was adopted as the [[National Emblem of Bangladesh]] by the [[Provisional Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh]] popularly known as the '''Mujibnagar Government''', was the [[government in exile]] of [[Bangladesh]] based in [[Kolkata]], [[India]], during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. Formed in early April 1971, the provisional government confirmed the declaration of independence of [[East Pakistan]] made earlier by Bengali nationalist leader [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] on 26 March.

[[Image:Guillaume Raynal2.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Guillaume Raynal.&lt;br/&gt; ([[Musée de la Révolution française]]).]]

'''Guillaume Thomas Raynal''' (12 April 1713 – 6 March 1796) was a French writer and [[man of letters]] during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

==Early life==
He was born at [[Lapanouse]] in [[Rouergue]]. He was educated at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school of [[Pézenas]], and received priest's orders, but he was dismissed for unexplained reasons from the parish of [[Saint-Sulpice (Paris)|Saint-Sulpice]], Paris.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} He became a writer and journalist, leaving the religious order for life.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt; The Abbé Raynal wrote for the ''[[Mercure de France]]'', and compiled a series of popular but superficial works, which he published and sold himself. These—''L'Histoire du stathoudérat'' (The Hague, 1748), ''L'Histoire du parlement d'Angleterre'' (London, 1748), ''Anecdotes historiques'' (Amsterdam, 3 vols., 1753)—gained for him access to the salons of [[Marie Thérèse Rodet Geoffrin|Mme. Geoffrin]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius|Helvétius]], and the [[Baron d'Holbach]].

In May 1754 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27raynal%27%29|title = Library and Archive Cataloue|publisher= The Royal Society|accessdate= 4 October 2010}}{{Dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Histoire philosophique des deux Indes''==
{{main article|Histoire des deux Indes}}
He had the assistance of various members of the ''philosophe côteries'' in his most important work, ''L'Histoire philosophique et politique des établissements et du commerce des Européens dans les deux Indes'' (''Philosophical and Political History of the Two Indies''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = de las Casas | first = Bartolomé | title = A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies | publisher = Penguin Books | year = 1992 | page = xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amsterdam, 4 vols., 1770&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;). [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] is credited with a third of this work, which was characterized by [[Voltaire]] as "''du réchauffé avec de la declamation''." The other chief collaborators were [[Pechméja]], [[Baron d'Holbach]], [[Jacques Paulze|Paulze]], the farmer-general of taxes, the Abbé Martin, and [[Alexandre Deleyre]]. To this piecemeal method of composition, in which narrative alternated with tirades on political and social questions, was added the further disadvantage of the lack of exact information, which, owing to the dearth of documents, could only have been gained by personal investigation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} He released an expanded edition in 1774 and another in 1780.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

The "philosophic" declamations perhaps constituted its chief interest for the general public, and its significance as a contribution to democratic propaganda. The ''Histoire'' went through many editions, being revised and augmented from time to time by Raynal; it was translated into the principal European languages, and appeared in various abridgments. Its introduction into France was forbidden in 1779; the book was burned by the public executioner, and an order was given for the arrest of the author, whose name had not appeared in the first edition, but was printed on the title page of the [[Geneva]] edition of 1780.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Seven new maps for the 1798 English edition were engraved by Thomas Kitchin, Jr.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4398/ |title = A Philosophical and Political History of the Settlements and Trade of the Europeans in the East and West Indies |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1798 |accessdate = 30 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book examines the [[East Indies]], South America, the [[West Indies]], and North America. The final chapter comprises theory around the future of Europe as a whole. Raynal also examines commerce, religion, [[slavery]], and other popular subjects, all with a perspective from the [[French Enlightenment]]. Additional versions of the book included maps of the discussed regions.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Raynal - Histoire philosophique, 1794 - 336.tif|thumb|''Histoire philosophique'', [[1794]].]]
Raynal went into exile, to [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], and then to [[Berlin]], where he was coolly received by [[Frederick the Great]], in spite of his connection with the philosophe party.

At [[St. Petersburg]] he met with a more cordial reception from [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]], and in 1787 he was permitted to return to France, though not to Paris. He showed generosity in assigning a considerable income to be divided annually among the peasant proprietors of upper Guienne. He was elected by Marseilles to the States-general, but refused to sit on the score of age. Raynal now realized the impossibility of a peaceful revolution, and, in terror of the proceedings for which the writings of himself and his friends had prepared the way, he sent to the Constituent Assembly an address, which was read on 31 May 1791, deprecating the violence of its reforms.

This address is said by [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]] (''Nouveaux lundis'', xi.) to have been composed chiefly by [[Clermont Tonnerre]] and [[Pierre Victor, baron Malouet|Pierre V. Malouet]], and it was regarded, even by moderate men, as ill-timed. The published ''Lettre de l'abbé Raynal a l'Assemblee nationale'' (10 December 1790) was really the work of the [[Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert|comte de Guibert]]. During the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]] Raynal lived in retirement at Passy and at [[Montlhery]]. On the establishment of the Directory in 1795 he became a member of the newly organized Institute of France.

Raynal died 6 March 1796 at [[Chaillot]].

==Bibliography==
A detailed bibliography of his works and of those falsely attributed to him will be found in [[Joseph Marie Quérard|Quérard]]'s ''La France littéraire'', and the same author's ''Supercheries dévoilées''. The biography by A Jay, prefixed to Peuchet's edition (Paris, 10 vols, 1820–1821) of the ''Histoire ... des Indes'', is of small value. To this edition Peuchet added two supplementary volumes on colonial development from 1785 to 1824. See also the anonymous ''Raynal démasqué'' (1791); [[Cherhal Montreal]], ''Éloge ... de G. T.

'''''Hare Tonic''''' is a 1945 [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon in the [[Looney Tunes]] series, directed by [[Chuck Jones]] and written by [[Tedd Pierce]]. It stars [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Elmer Fudd]], making this the second cartoon directed by Jones to co-star the two (the first being [[Elmer's Pet Rabbit]]). Voice characterizations are by [[Mel Blanc]] and [[Arthur Q. Bryan]], respectively.

The title is a play on "hair tonic", a type of patent medicine, reinforced by Bugs' portrayal of a fake doctor at one point in the picture. A bottle of "hare tonic" appeared as a prop in a 1946 cartoon, ''[[The Big Snooze]]''.

==Plot==
Elmer Fudd has purchased Bugs Bunny at a local grocery store (with a sign visible in the window offering a special on "[[Fresh Hare]]") and is taking him home to make a meal. As he walks along, he sings the tune of "[[Shortnin' Bread]]", substituting "[[Rabbit|Wabbit]] Stew". Bugs pops out of Elmer's basket, munching on a [[carrot]] that was in there with him, and asks, "Eh, whatcha got in the basket, doc?" Elmer replies, "I got me a wabbit! I'm gonna cook me a wabbit stew!" Bugs states his "love" of rabbit stew (though he is clearly a rabbit) and then begs to see Elmer's rabbit. When Elmer opens his basket and finds it empty (Bugs had quickly climbed out), Bugs pushes his nemesis into his own basket and then sings the tune Elmer had been singing &amp;mdash; but then Elmer realizes he's been tricked, and so he re-reverses the switch. Foreshadowing pranks to come, Bugs tells the audience from inside the basket (à la [[Red Skelton]]'s "mean widdle kid"), "He don't know me vewy well, do he?"

Once at home, Bugs easily secures his escape by distracting Elmer, tricking him into thinking the phone has rung. However, just as he's about to leave, he decides that the setup's too easy and he just can't leave. He decides to stay and heckle his would-be devourer. Bugs effects a radio broadcast that warns of the dread disease "rabbititis", which is contracted from rabbits "sold within the last three days" and which causes people to see spots and have "delusions assuming the characteristics of rabbits", which is followed by the onset of schizophrenia and depersonalization disorder.This frightens the gullible Elmer and he informs Bugs that he is free to leave. Bugs, however, decides he doesn't want to leave by saying "Oh, no, Doc. Wouldn't think of it. We're gonna brew a stew, remember?", only to make Elmer back away, forcing him to hide on top of his door: "Oh no! Pwease, Mr. Wabbit! Go away! Don't come any cwoser! D-Don't come near me! NOOOOOOOOO!". Bugs, thinking he has [[Body Odor|B.O.]], sniffs his glove and tells the audience "Oh, goodness! Don't tell me I offend." just as Elmer pleads with Bugs to "Make twacks. Scuwwy away. SCWAM!" to which Bugs angrily replies as he leaves "OKAY! I CAN TAKE A HINT! I KNOW WHEN I'M NOT WANTED! GOODBYE!". But when Bugs returns, Elmer reminds him that Bugs has to "scwam", but Bugs points to a sign on the door that states "QUARANTINED FOR RABBITITUS (RABBITITIS). NO ONE MAY LEAVE PREMISES."

[[File:Hare Tonic.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bugs as "Dr. Killpatient", about to confuse Elmer again. Animation by Ben Washam.]]Thus Bugs stays to torment Elmer, and many hijinks ensue, including Bugs posing as Elmer's shower faucets {"Gurgle, gurgle. Why don't ya' pay ya' water bill, Doc?"} and a doctor ("Dr. Killpatient", parodying [[Dr. Kildare]]), painting a room with red, yellow and blue spots to make Elmer think he sees spots before his eyes and pretending to be Elmer's reflection in the mirror (a scene inspired by the famous mirror scene in the Marx Brothers' film, ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'') and his own ''rabbity'' image reflected at him in a mirror that's really just Bugs after the glass has been removed. And when Dr. Killpatient (Bugs) tests Elmer's reflexes, Elmer goes into a familiar [[Russian language|Russian]] kick dance, and Bugs decides to join him in a [[busby]] hat and boots. Finally, Elmer sees Bugs' game and chases him out of the house with a shotgun. But Bugs quickly halts the chase and, in an unusually lengthy breaking of the [[fourth wall]], even by Bugs' standards, he convinces Elmer that members of the audience are now afflicted with rabbititis by saying "Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Look, the people out there in the audience - the lady there with the long ears. They're getting longer all the time. And the guy back there in the seventeenth row with the cute tomato - he's gettin' all fuzzy. Yeah, they've got it. Everybody out there's got rabbititis! Yaah!" which causes Elmer to flee back into his house in a terror of panic.

Bugs then addresses the audience and says the whole thing was "just a gag, of course" and that if the audience really had rabbititis, they'd see swirling red and yellow spots, whereupon red and yellow spots are seen swirling on the screen, and the underscore starts to build dramatically. Immediately after Bugs says, "And then suddenly, everything'd go black!" the screen does suddenly go black, and the music stops abruptly and dramatically, followed by a second or two of dark silence. Bugs snickers and the cartoon ends.

==Notes==
* This cartoon marks one of the few times Bugs addresses Elmer by name, albeit in the guise of "Dr. Killpatient", who addresses him as "Mr. Fudd". Despite their frequent cinematic encounters, many of their cartoons are played as if they had never met before.

* This and [[Baseball Bugs]] feature a Bugs Bunny variant of the then-usual closing, where instead of Porky Pig busting out of a drum, he does, proclaiming "...And that's the end!" while chomping on a carrot.

'''''Heart of Darkness''''' (1899) is a [[novella]] by Polish-English novelist [[Joseph Conrad]] about a narrated voyage up the [[Congo River]] into the [[Congo Free State]] in the so-called ''heart of Africa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.britannica.com/topic/Heart-of-Darkness Heart of Darkness Novella by Conrad] – ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 2 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Marlow]], the narrator, tells his story to friends aboard a boat anchored on the [[River Thames]]. This setting provides the [[frame story|frame]] for Marlow's story of his obsession with the ivory trader [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]], which enables Conrad to create a parallel between what Conrad calls "the greatest town on earth", [[London]], and Africa as places of darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Chinua Achebe "An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness''" in ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', vol. 2 (7th edition) (2000), p. 2036.&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Conrad's work is the idea that there is little difference between so-called civilised people and those described as savages; ''Heart of Darkness'' raises questions about [[imperialism]] and racism.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology'', 7th edition, (2000), p. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally issued as a three-part serial story in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' to celebrate the thousandth edition of the magazine,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Scotland: Blackwoods magazine exhibition.  In Blackwood's, the story is titled "The Heart of Darkness" but when published as a separate book the "The" was dropped from the title.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heart of Darkness'' has been widely re-published and translated into many languages. In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''Heart of Darkness'' 67th on their list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best novels]] in English of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html 100 Best] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207224252/http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html |date=7 February 2010 }}, Modern Library's website.

==Composition and publication==
In 1890, at the age of 32, Conrad was appointed by a Belgian trading company to serve on one of its [[Steamboat|steamers]]. While sailing up the [[Congo River]] from one station to another, the captain became ill and Conrad assumed command. He guided the ship up the [[tributary]] [[Lualaba River]] to the trading company's innermost station, [[Kindu]], in [[Maniema|Eastern Kongo]]. The story's main narrator, Charles Marlow, has similar experiences to the author himself.&lt;ref name="Bloom"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Conrad.PNG|thumb|left|upright|[[Joseph Conrad]] based ''Heart of Darkness'' on his own experiences in the [[Congo Basin|Congo]].]]
When Conrad began to write the novella, eight years after returning from Africa, he drew inspiration from his travel journals.&lt;ref name="Bloom"/&gt; He described ''Heart of Darkness'' as "a wild story" of a journalist who becomes manager of a station in the (African) interior and makes himself worshipped by a tribe of savages. Thus described, the subject seems comic, but isn't.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Karl|Davies|1986|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale was first published as a three-part serial, February, March and April 1899, in ''Blackwood's Magazine'' (February 1899 was the magazine's 1000th issue: special edition). Then later, in 1902, ''Heart of Darkness'' was included in the book ''[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories|Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories]]'' (published on 13 November 1902, by [[William Blackwood]]).

The volume consisted of ''[[Youth (Conrad story)|Youth: a Narrative]]'', ''Heart of Darkness'' and ''The End of the Tether'' in that order. For future editions of the book, in 1917 Conrad wrote an "[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories/Author's Note|Author's Note]]" where he, after denying any "unity of artistic purpose" underlying the collection, discusses each of the three stories, and makes light commentary on the character Marlow—the narrator of the tales within the first two stories. He also mentions how ''Youth'' marks the first appearance of Marlow.

On 31 May 1902, in a letter to William Blackwood, Conrad remarked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I call your own kind self to witness ... the last pages of Heart of Darkness where the interview of the man and the girl locks in—as it were—the whole 30000 words of narrative description into one suggestive view of a whole phase of life and makes of that story something quite on another plane than an anecdote of a man who went mad in the Centre of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Karl|Davies|1986|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There have been many proposed sources for the character of the antagonist, Kurtz. [[Georges-Antoine Klein]], an agent who became ill and later died aboard Conrad's steamer, has been identified by scholars and literary critics as one basis for Kurtz. The principal figures involved in the disastrous "rear column" of the [[Emin Pasha Relief Expedition]] have also been identified as likely sources, including column leader [[Edmund Musgrave Barttelot]], slave trader [[Tippu Tip]] and the expedition's overall leader, Welsh explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ho"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |title=King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1998 |isbn=0-395-75924-2 |pages=98, 145 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYo-DO4tr-gC&amp;pg=PA98 |via=[[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Hochschild]], in ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'', believes that the Belgian soldier [[Léon Rom]] is the most important influence on the character.&lt;ref&gt;Ankomah, Baffour (October 1999).

==Plot summary==
Aboard the ''Nellie'', anchored in the [[River Thames]] near [[Gravesend]], England, Charles Marlow tells his fellow sailors about the events that led to his appointment as captain of a river steamboat for an [[Ivory trade|ivory trading]] company. As a child, Marlow had been fascinated by "the blank spaces" on maps, particularly by the biggest, which by the time he had grown up was no longer blank but turned into "a place of darkness" (Conrad 10). Yet there remained a big river, "resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the land" (Conrad 10). The image of this river on the map fascinated Marlow "as a snake would a bird" (Conrad 10). Feeling as though "instead of going to the centre of a continent I were about to set off for the centre of the earth", Marlow takes passage on a French steamer bound for the African coast and then into the interior (Conrad 18). After more than thirty days the ship anchors off the seat of the government near the mouth of the big river. Marlow, with still some two hundred miles to go, now takes passage on a little sea-going steamer captained by a Swede. He departs some thirty miles up the river where his Company's station is. Work on the railway is going on, involving removal of rocks with explosives. Marlow enters a narrow ravine to stroll in the shade under the trees, and finds himself in "the gloomy circle of some Inferno": the place is full of diseased Africans who worked on the railroad and now await their deaths, their sickened bodies already as thin as air (Conrad 24–25). Marlow witnesses the scene "horror-struck" (Conrad 26).

Marlow has to wait for ten days in the Company's Outer Station, where he sleeps in a hut. At this station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation, he meets the Company's impeccably dressed chief accountant who tells him of a [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Mr. Kurtz]], who is in charge of a very important trading-post, and a widely respected, first-class agent, a "'very remarkable person'" who "'Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together'" (Conrad 28). The agent predicts that Kurtz will go very far: "'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above—the Council in Europe, you know—mean him to be'" (Conrad 29).

[[File:VingtAnnees 289.jpg|thumb|Belgian river station on the Congo River, 1889]]

Marlow departs with a caravan of sixty men to travel on foot some two hundred miles into the wilderness to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he is to captain is based. On the fifteenth day of his march, he arrives at the station, which has some twenty employees, and is shocked to learn from a fellow European that his steamboat had been wrecked in a mysterious accident two days earlier. He meets the general manager, who informs him that he could wait no longer for Marlow to arrive, because the up-river stations had to be relieved, and rumours had one important station in jeopardy because its chief, the exceptional Mr. Kurtz, was ill. "Hang Kurtz", Marlow thinks, irritated (Conrad 34). He fishes his boat out of the river and is occupied with its repair for some months, during which a sudden fire destroys a grass shed full of materials used to trade with the natives. While one of the natives is tortured for allegedly causing the fire, Marlow is invited in the room of the station's brick-maker, a man who spent a year waiting for material to make bricks. Marlow gets the impression the man wants to pump him, and is curious to know what kind of information he is after. Hanging on the wall is "a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a lighted torch" (Conrad 39). Marlow is fascinated with the sinister effect of the torchlight upon the woman's face, and is informed that Mr. Kurtz made the painting in the station a year ago. The brick-maker calls Kurtz "'a prodigy'" and "'an emissary of pity, and science, and progress'", and feels Kurtz represents the "'higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose'" needed for the cause Europe entrusts the Company with (Conrad 39). The man predicts Kurtz will rise in the hierarchy within two years and then makes the connection to Marlow: "'The same people who sent him specially also recommended you'" (Conrad 39–40).

Marlow is frustrated by the months it takes to perform the necessary repairs, made all the slower by the lack of proper tools and replacement parts at the station. During this time, he learns that Kurtz is far from admired, but more or less resented (mostly by the manager).

Once underway, the journey up-river to Kurtz's station takes two months to the day. The steamboat stops briefly near an abandoned hut on the riverbank, where Marlow finds a pile of wood and a note indicating that the wood is for them and that they should proceed quickly but with caution as they near the Inner Station.

[[File:VingtAnnees 286.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The ''Roi des Belges'' ("King of the Belgians"—French), the Belgian riverboat Conrad commanded on the upper Congo, 1889]]
The journey pauses for the night about eight miles below the Inner Station. In the morning the crew awakens to find that the boat is enveloped by a thick white fog. From the riverbank they hear a very loud cry, followed by a discordant clamour. A few hours later, as safe navigation becomes increasingly difficult, the steamboat is attacked with a barrage of small arrows from the forest. The helmsman is impaled by a spear and falls at Marlow's feet. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers and causing the shower of arrows to cease. Marlow and a pilgrim (Marlow's word for the European hangers-on in the steamer) watch the helmsman die. In a flash forward, Marlow notes that the [[International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs]] had commissioned Kurtz to write a report, which he did eloquently. A handwritten postscript, apparently added later by Kurtz, reads "Exterminate all the brutes!" (Conrad 83).

At Kurtz's station Marlow sees a man on the riverbank waving his arm, urging them to land. The pilgrims, heavily armed, escort the manager on to the shore to retrieve Mr. Kurtz. The man from the bank boards the steamboat, and turns out to be a Russian wanderer who had happened to stray into Kurtz's camp. He explains that he had left the wood and the note at the abandoned hut. Through conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz can be; how the natives worship him; and how very ill he has been of late. The Russian admires Kurtz for his intellect and his insights into love, life, and justice, and suggests that he is a poet. He tells of how Kurtz opened his mind, and seems to admire him even for his power—and for his willingness to use it. Marlow, on the other hand, suggests that Kurtz has gone mad.

From the steamboat, Marlow observes the station in detail and is surprised to see near the station house a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, the manager appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz on an improvised stretcher. The area fills with natives, apparently ready for battle, but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher, and the natives retreat into the forest. The pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins, where he and the manager have a private conversation. Marlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer. When the manager exits the cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the Company's business in the region, that his methods are "unsound". Later, the Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the Company wants to remove him from the station and kill him, and Marlow confirms that hangings had been discussed.

[[File:LeonRom.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Léon Rom]], photographed {{circa}} 1880, who some have argued served as the inspiration for Kurtz]]
After midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin on the steamer and returned to shore. He goes ashore and finds a very weak Kurtz crawling his way back to the station house, though not too weak to call to the natives for help. Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm, but Kurtz only laments that he had not accomplished more in the region. The next day they prepare for their journey back down the river. The natives, including the ornately dressed woman, once again assemble on shore and begin to shout unintelligibly. Noticing the pilgrims readying their rifles, Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly to scatter the crowd of natives. Only the woman remains unmoved, with outstretched arms. The pilgrims open fire as the current carries them swiftly downstream.

Kurtz's health worsens on the return trip, and Marlow himself becomes increasingly ill. The steamboat breaks down and, while it is stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them away from the manager. When Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; as he dies, Marlow hears him weakly whisper: "The horror! The horror!" (Conrad 116). A short while later, the "manager's boy" announces to the rest of the crew, in a scathing tone, "Mistah Kurtz—he dead" (Conrad 117). The next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury "something" in a muddy hole (Conrad 117). He falls very ill, himself near death.

Upon his return to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the "civilised" world. Many callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz had entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in. He then gives Kurtz's report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit. Finally Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz's fiancée, whom Kurtz referred to as "My Intended" (Conrad 79). When Marlow visits her, she is dressed in black and still deep in mourning, although it has been more than a year since Kurtz's death. She presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz's final words. Uncomfortable, Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz's final word was her name.

==Reception==
Literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] wrote that ''Heart of Darkness'' had been analysed more than any other work of literature that is studied in universities and colleges, which he attributed to Conrad's "unique propensity for ambiguity". However, it was not a big success during Conrad's life.&lt;ref name="Bloom2"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2004|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was published as a single volume in 1902 with two more novellas, "Youth" and "The End of the Tether", it received the least commentary from critics.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; [[F. R. Leavis]] referred to ''Heart of Darkness'' as a "minor work" and criticised its "adjectival insistence upon inexpressible and incomprehensible mystery".&lt;ref name="Moore5"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2004|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conrad himself did not consider it to be particularly notable.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; By the 1960s, though, it was a standard assignment in many college and high school English courses.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for the whole sentence.|date=April 2018}}

In ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'' (1998), [[Adam Hochschild]] wrote that literary scholars have made too much of the psychological aspects of ''Heart of Darkness'', while paying scant attention to Conrad's accurate recounting of the horror arising from the methods and effects of colonialism in the Congo Free State. "''Heart of Darkness'' is experience ... pushed a little (and only very little) beyond the actual facts of the case."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hochschild|1999|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critiques include Hugh Curtler's ''Achebe on Conrad: Racism and Greatness in Heart of Darkness'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Curtler, Hugh|title=Achebe on Conrad: Racism and Greatness in Heart of Darkness|journal=Conradiana|volume=29|issue= 1|date=March 1997|pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving beyond ideology critique, French philosopher Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe called ''Heart of Darkness'' "one of the greatest texts of Western literature" and used Conrad's tale for a reflection on "The Horror of the West".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/conrads-heart-of-darkness-and-contemporary-thought-9781441101006/|title=The Horror of the West|last=Lacoue-Labarthe|first=Philippe|website=|publisher=Bloomsbury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinua Achebe - Buffalo 25Sep2008 crop.jpg|thumb|Chinua Achebe's 1975 lecture on the book sparked decades of debate.]]

''Heart of Darkness'' is criticised in [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] studies,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/book-reviews-tuesday-tome-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad/|title = A Controversy Worth Teaching: Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness and the Ethics of Stature|date = 6 October 2015|access-date = 19 February 2016|website = The Gemsbok|last = Podgorski|first = Daniel|series = Your Tuesday Tome}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly by Nigerian novelist [[Chinua Achebe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinua Achebe Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/chinua-achebe-20617665#synopsis|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1975 public lecture "[[An Image of Africa]]: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness", Achebe described Conrad's novella as "an offensive and deplorable book" that [[Dehumanization|de-humanised]] Africans.&lt;ref name=Watts&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watts|first=Cedric|title='A Bloody Racist': About Achebe's View of Conrad|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3508121?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102956766521|work=The Yearbook of English Studies|year=1983|accessdate=18 November 2013|doi=10.2307/3508121|volume=13|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achebe argued that Conrad, "blinkered ... with xenophobia", incorrectly depicted Africa as the antithesis of Europe and civilisation, ignoring the artistic accomplishments of the [[Fang people]] who lived in the Congo River basin at the time of the book's publication. He argued that the book promoted and continues to promote a prejudiced image of Africa that "depersonalises a portion of the human race", and concluded that it should not be considered a great work of art.&lt;ref name=Achebe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Achebe|first=Chinua|title=An Image of Africa|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3818468|work=Research in African Literatures|year=1978|accessdate=13 December 2013|doi=10.2307/3818468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Zimbabwean scholar Rino Zhuwarara broadly agreed with Achebe, though considered it important to be "sensitised to how peoples of other nations perceive Africa".&lt;ref name="Moore6"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2004|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Botswanan scholar Peter Mwikisa concluded the book was "the great lost opportunity to depict dialogue between Africa and Europe."&lt;ref&gt;Mwikisa, Peter. "Conrad's Image of Africa: Recovering African Voices in ''Heart of Darkness''. ''Mots Pluriels'' 13 (April 2000): 20–28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, British academic [[Cedric Watts]] criticized Achebe's apparent assertion that only black people may accurately analyse and assess the novella. Stan Galloway writes, in a comparison of ''Heart of Darkness'' with '' Jungle Tales of Tarzan'', "The inhabitants [of both works], whether antagonists or compatriots, were clearly imaginary and meant to represent a particular fictive cipher and not a particular African people."&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, Stan. ''The Teenage Tarzan: A Literary Analysis of Edgar Rice Burroughs'', ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2010. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist [[Caryl Phillips]] stated in 2003 that: "Achebe is right; to the African reader the price of Conrad's eloquent denunciation of colonisation is the recycling of racist notions of the 'dark' continent and her people. Those of us who are not from Africa may be prepared to pay this price, but this price is far too high for Achebe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Caryl|title=Out of Africa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/classics.chinuaachebe|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent critics have stressed that the "continuities" between Conrad and Achebe are profound and that a form of "postcolonial mimesis" ties the two authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nidesh |last=Lawtoo |title=A Picture of Africa: Frenzy, Counternarrative, Mimesis |journal=Modern Fiction Studies |volume=59 |issue=1 |year=2013 |pages=26–52 |doi=10.1353/mfs.2013.0000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations and influences==

===Radio and stage plays===
[[Orson Welles]] adapted and starred in ''Heart of Darkness'' in a [[CBS Radio]] broadcast on 6 November 1938 as part of his series, ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]''. In 1939 Welles adapted the story for his first film for [[RKO Pictures]], writing a screenplay with [[John Houseman]]. It was intended to be entirely filmed as a POV from Marlow's eyes. Welles even filmed a short presentation film illustrating his intent. It has been reported as lost to history. The project was never realised; one reason given was the loss of European markets after the outbreak of war. Welles still hoped to produce the film when he presented another radio adaptation of the story as his first program as producer-star of the CBS radio series ''[[This Is My Best]]''. Welles scholar [[Bret Wood]] called the broadcast of 13 March 1945, "the closest representation of the film Welles might have made, crippled, of course, by the absence of the story's visual elements (which were so meticulously designed) and the half-hour length of the broadcast."&lt;ref name="Bret Wood"&gt;[[Bret Wood|Wood, Bret]], ''Orson Welles: A Bio-Bibliography''. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1990 {{ISBN|0-313-26538-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|95, 153–156,136–137|date=March 2014}}

In 1991, Australian author and playwright [[Larry Buttrose]] wrote and staged a theatrical production of ''Kurtz'' (based on ''Heart of Darkness'') with the Crossroads Theatre Company, Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsB/buttrose-larry.html|title=Larry Buttrose|publisher=doollee.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was announced to be broadcast as a radio play to Australian radio audiences in August 2011 by the [[Vision Australia Radio]] Network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionaustralia.org/info.aspx?page=749|title=Vision Australia|publisher=Visionaustralia.org|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801191453/http://www.visionaustralia.org/info.aspx?page=749|archivedate=1 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by the RPH – [[Radio Print Handicapped Network]] across Australia.

In 2011, an [[Heart of Darkness (opera)|operatic adaptation]] by composer [[Tarik O'Regan]] and librettist [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]] was premiered at the [[Linbury Studio Theatre|Linbury Theatre]] of the [[Royal Opera House]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roh.org.uk/whatson/production.aspx?pid=17248 Royal Opera House Page for ''Heart of Darkness''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020223221/http://www.roh.org.uk/whatson/production.aspx?pid=17248 |date=20 October 2011 }} by [[Tarik O'Regan]] and [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]]&lt;/ref&gt; A suite for orchestra and narrator was subsequently extrapolated from it.&lt;ref name=RPO&gt;{{Citation|title=''Suite from Heart of Darkness'' first London performance|publisher=Cadogan Hall|url=http://www.cadoganhall.com/event/royal-philharmonic-orchestra-130423/|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an adaption of Orson Welles' screenplay by Jamie Lloyd and Laurence Bowen was aired on [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Orson Welles' Heart of Darkness, Unmade Movies, Drama – BBC Radio 4|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06k9bz9|publisher = BBC|accessdate = 3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production starred [[James McAvoy]] as Marlow.

===Film and television===
The [[CBS]] television anthology ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' aired a 90-minute loose adaptation in 1958. This version, written by [[Stewart Stern]], uses the encounter between Marlow ([[Roddy McDowall]]) and Kurtz ([[Boris Karloff]]) as its final act, and adds a backstory in which Marlow had been Kurtz's adopted son. The cast includes [[Inga Swenson]] and [[Eartha Kitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Cast and credits are available at [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0675574/ "The Internet Movie Database"]. Retrieved 2 December 2010. A full recording of the show can be viewed onsite by members of the public upon request at [[The Paley Center for Media]] (formerly the Museum of Television &amp; Radio) in New York City and Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous adaptation is [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1979 motion picture ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' based on the screenplay by [[John Milius]], which moves the story from the Congo to [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=29 September 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/03/movies/critic-s-notebook-aching-heart-of-darkness.html |title= Aching Heart of Darkness  |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 August 2001 |author=Scott, A. O. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Apocalypse Now'', [[Martin Sheen]] plays Captain Benjamin L. Willard, a [[United States Army|US Army]] Captain assigned to "terminate the command" of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. [[Marlon Brando]] played Kurtz, in one of his most famous roles. A production documentary of the film, titled ''[[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse]]'', exposed some of the major difficulties which director Coppola faced in seeing the movie through to completion. The difficulties that Coppola and his crew faced mirrored some of the themes of the book.

On 13 March 1993 [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] aired [[Heart of Darkness (1993 film)|a new version of the story]] directed by [[Nicolas Roeg]], starring [[Tim Roth]] as Marlow and [[John Malkovich]] as Kurtz.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Ken.

===Video games===
The video game ''[[Far Cry 2]],'' released on 21 October 2008, is a loose modernised adaptation of ''Heart of Darkness''. The player assumes the role of a mercenary operating in Africa whose task it is to kill an arms dealer, the elusive "Jackal". The last area of the game is called 'The Heart of Darkness'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/feature-far-cry-2s-heart-darkness/|title=The Darkness|author=Mikel Reparaz|date=30 July 2007|work=GamesRadar+}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infovore.org/archives/2008/12/22/africa-wins-again/ |title=Africa Wins Again: Far Cry 2’s literary approach to narrative |publisher=Infovore.org |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etc.cmu.edu/etcpress/content/far-cry-2-jorge-albor|title=Far Cry 2 – Jorge Albor – ETC Press|work=Cmu.edu|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video game ''[[Spec Ops: The Line]],'' released on 26 June 2012, is a direct modernised adaptation of ''Heart of Darkness''. The player assumes the role of special-ops agent Martin Walker as he and his team search [[Dubai]] for survivors in the aftermath of catastrophic sandstorms that left the city without contact to the outside world. The character John Konrad, who replaces the character Kurtz, is a reference to the author of the novella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/games/886896-spec-ops-the-line-preview-heart-of-darkness|title=Spec Ops: The Line preview – heart of darkness|work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Victoria II]]'', a grand strategy game produced by [[Paradox Interactive]], launched an expansion pack titled "Heart of Darkness" on 16 April 2013, which  revamped the game's colonial system, and naval warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paradoxplaza.com/victoria-2-heart-of-darkness|title=Victoria 2: Heart of Darkness – Paradox Interactive|publisher=Paradoxplaza.com|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
The novel ''Hearts of Darkness'', by Paul Lawrence, moves the events of the novel to England in 1666. Marlow's journey into the jungle is reimagined as the journey of the narrator, Harry Lytle, and his friend Davy Dowling out of London and towards Shyam, a plague-stricken town that has descended into cruelty and barbarism loosely modelled on real-life [[Eyam]]. While Marlow must return to civilisation with Kurtz, Lytle and Dowling are searching for the spy James Josselin. Like Kurtz, Josselin's reputation is immense, and the protagonists are well-acquainted with his accomplishments by the time they finally meet him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allisonandbusby.com/book/heart-of-darkness-hardback|title=Hearts of Darkness|publisher=Allisonandbusby.com|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet Yedda Morrison's 2012 book ''Darkness'' erases Conrad's novella, "whiting out" his text so that only images of the natural world remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yeddamorrison.com/words/darkness/2/|title=Yedda Morrison|first=Yedda|last=Morrison|publisher=Yeddamorrison.com|accessdate=17 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518070748/http://yeddamorrison.com/words/darkness/2/|archive-date=18 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Reich's ''Mistah Kurtz! A Prelude to Heart of Darkness'' presents the early life of Kurtz, his appointment to his station in the Congo, and his messianic disintegration in a novel that dovetails with the conclusion of Conrad's novella. Reich's novel is premised upon the papers Kurtz leaves to Marlow at the end of ''Heart of Darkness.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fictionadvocate.com/2016/03/14/qa-with-james-reich-author-of-mistah-kurtz/|title=Q&amp;A with James Reich, Author of Mistah Kurtz|last=Hurley|first=Brian|access-date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Josef Škvorecký]]'s novel ''[[The Engineer of Human Souls]]'' Kurtz is seen as the epitome of exterminatory colonialism, and here and elsewhere Škvorecký emphasises the importance of Conrad's concern with Russian imperialism in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Škvorecký, Josef (1984).  [https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/crossc/ANW0935.1984.001/269:21?rgn=author;view=image;q1=Skvorecky%2C+Josef "Why the Harlequin?  On Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness''."]  ''Cross Currents:  A Yearbook of Central European Culture'', vol. 3, pp. 259-264.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. S. Eliot]] wrote "Mistah Kurtz—he dead" at the beginning of the poem ''[[The Hollow Men]]'', quoting the "manager's boy" when he announced the death of Kurtz to the crew.

'''India Government Mint, Hyderabad''' is one of the four [[mint (coin)|mints]] in India. Based in [[Cherlapally]], [[Secunderabad]] ([[Twin cities (geographical proximity)|twin city]] of [[Hyderabad]]) in the Indian state of [[Telangana]], the mint was originally established in 1803 [[Anno Domini|AD]] as the ''Royal Mint'' to serve as the mint for the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. The mint was founded by [[Mir Akbar Ali Khan Sikander Jah, Asaf Jah III]] and was originally situated at Sultan Sahi in [[Moghalpura]] suburb of [[Hyderabad]] city. In 1950, the mint was taken over by the [[Government of India]], and in 1997 it was shifted to its present location at [[Cherlapally]] in [[Secunderabad]]. Indian 1, 2, 5 and 10 rupee coins are produced in this mint.&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile|publisher=Official website|accessdate=9 January 2017|url=http://igmhyderabad.spmcil.com/Interface/AboutIGMH.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coins"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coins|publisher=Reserve Bank of India|accessdate=9 January 2017|url=https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/ic_coins.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Till early 19th century, mints were privately operated by wealthy businessmen ([[Sahu]]s, [[Jagirdar]]s and Omaras) in India. Licenses for minting coins were obtained by paying fees to the [[exchequer]]. The mints used to produce coins with the name of Emperor in Delhi. ''FIDVI'', ''QITAAB'' (title) and lettering "Yar-E-Wafadar" (trusted follower) were added to the coins.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite news|title=History|publisher=Official website|accessdate=9 January 2017|url=http://igmhyderabad.spmcil.com/Interface/HistoryIGMH.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1803–1858===
India Government Mint, Hyderabad was established in 1803 AD by [[Mir Akbar Ali Khan Sikander Jah, Asaf Jah III]] as a private mint and along with other private mints in the country. The mint produced [[Coinage of India|Indian coins]] in the name of [[Emperor of India]]. Initially the mint was situated at Sultan Sahi in Moghalpura suburb of the Hyderabad city. The [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]] were made of steel but the private mints did not have a master die. The dies hence differed in size, production of coins was crude with only partial inscription appearing on coins frequently.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

===1858–1903===
With the [[Mughal Empire|end of the Mughal empire]] in 1858 [[Anno Domini|AD]], all private mints (except Hyderabad, [[India Government Mint, Kolkata|Kolkata]] and [[India Government Mint, Mumbai|Mumbai]]) were abolished. Coins produced thereafter ceased to carry the name of ''Emperor of India''. Instead, coins produced in the ''Hyderabad Royal Mint'' were inscribed with name of the dynasty, initials of [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] and the numeral 92 (of [[Islamic]] religious significance; represents sum of symbolic numbers of the letters in [[Prophets and messengers in Islam]]). These coins were called ''Halli Sicca'' coins (current coins). In 1985 AD, use of machinery was introduced in coin making and the machine made coins were called "Charkhi coins" (Charkhi means "wheel" in Hindi).&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

===1903–1950===
On 13 July 1903, a new mint was established in [[Saifabad]], Hyderabad and the operations were shifted to the new location. In 1950, post "Federal Financial Integration", the mint was over-taken by the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;

===1950–1997===
The Hyderabad mint operated in Saifabad from 1950 to 1997. On 20 August 1997, the mint was shifted to its present location at [[Cherlapally]] in the city of Secunderabad, India. The facility was established with annual production capacity of 700 million coins and 950&amp;nbsp;million [[planchet]]s.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;

===1997 – present===
India Government Mint in Hyderabad has been operating at the same location since 1997. As a result of the [[corporatisation]], from 13 January 2006 the mint is functioning as one of the units of the [[Security Printing &amp; Minting Corporation of India Limited]] (SPMCIL).&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corporatization"&gt;{{cite news|title=Corporatization|publisher=Official website|accessdate=9 January 2017|url=http://igmnoida.spmcil.com/Interface/History.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Since 13 January 2006, the India Government Mint, Hyderabad functions as one of the units of the "Security Printing &amp; Minting Corporation of India Limited". The mint is headed by a "general manager".&lt;ref name="Organization Structure"&gt;{{cite news|title=Organization Structure|publisher=Official website|accessdate=9 January 2017|url=http://igmhyderabad.spmcil.com/Interface/OrgStructure.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mint mark==
Coins minted at the India Government Mint, Hyderabad carries the [[mint mark]] of a ''five-pointed star'' ('''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;*&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''), symbolising that the coin was produced in the Hyderabad mint.&lt;ref name="Mint mark"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mint mark|publisher=numista|accessdate=9 January 2017|url=https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces24942.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The India Government Mint in Hyderabad was planned with an estimated annual production capacity of annual production capacity of 700 million coins and 950 million [[planchet]]s. [[Indian rupee]] coins (1, 2, 5 &amp; 10) are produced in this mint.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;

The '''Lewis chessmen''' ({{lang-no|Lewisbrikkene}}; {{lang-gd|Fir-Tàilisg}}; {{lang-sco|Lewis chesmen}}) or '''Uig chessmen''', named after the [[Uig, Lewis|bay]] where they were found,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceuig.co.uk/uig-chessmen/ |title=Uig Chessmen &amp;#124; Comann Eachdraidh Uig |publisher=Ceuig.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a group of distinctive [[12th-century]] [[chess]] pieces, along with other game pieces, most of which are carved from [[walrus ivory]]. Discovered in 1831 on [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]], Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=6665 |title=The enigma of the Lewis chessmen |publisher=Chessbase |date=9 November 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; they may constitute some of the few complete, surviving [[medieval]] [[chess set]]s, although it is not clear if a set as originally made can be assembled from the pieces. When found, the hoard contained 93 artifacts: 78 chess pieces, 14 [[Tables (board game)|tablemen]] and one belt buckle. Today, 82 pieces are owned and usually exhibited by the [[British Museum]] in [[London]], and the remaining 11 are at the [[National Museum of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]].

== Origin ==
[[File:Beserker, Lewis Chessmen, British Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|"[[Berserker]]" warder (rook), in the British Museum]]
The British Museum claims the chessmen were probably made in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]], in the 12th century,&lt;ref name="British Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/the_lewis_chessmen.aspx |title=The Lewis Chessmen |publisher=British Museum |date= |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some scholars have suggested other Nordic countries.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
During that period, the [[Outer Hebrides]], along with other major groups of [[Scottish islands]], were ruled by Norway.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

According to Dr. Alex Woolf, director of the [[University of St Andrews]] Institute for Medieval Studies, there are reasons for believing the pieces came from Trondheim:
*A broken queen piece in a similar style was found in an excavation of the archbishop's palace &amp;ndash; it appeared the piece was broken as it was being made.
*The presence of wealthy people in Trondheim able to pay craftsmen for high-quality chess pieces.
*Similar carving in [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in Trondheim.
*The excavation in Trondheim of a kite-shaped shield similar to shields on some of the pieces and a king piece of similar design found on [[Hitra (island)|Hitra]] Island, near the mouth of [[Trondheim Fjord]]. Woolf has said that the armour worn by the chess figures includes "perfect" reproductions of armour worn at the time in Norway.&lt;ref name=dlmnyt&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/arts/09lewis.html |title=Reopening History of Storied Norse Chessmen |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=14 September 2010 |date=8 September 2010 |last=McClain, Dylan Loeb}} (appeared 9 September 2010 in the newspaper, page C2, ''New York Times'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Icelanders Gudmundur Thorarinsson and Einar Einarsson have proposed that the chessmen originated in Iceland, since only in Iceland were the [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]]s called that at that time, while in other countries they used a name unassociated with the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.leit.is/lewis/ |title=Are the Isle of Lewis chessmen Icelandic? |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further claim that the pieces were carved by an artist known as [[Margret the Adroit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Nancy Marie |title=Ivory Vikings: the Mystery of the most Famous Chessmen in the World and the Woman who Made Them |date=2015 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=9781137279378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McClain |first1=Dylan Loeb |title=Reopening History of Storied Ivory Chessmen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/arts/09lewis.html?_r=0 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21662487-bones-contention |title=Bones of Contention |date=29 August 2015 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is disputed by Woolf, who stated that the use of bishops originated in England,&lt;ref name=dlmnyt/&gt; and by Norwegian chess historian and member of the Ken Whyld Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Membership and Members |url=http://www.kwabc.org/index.php/membership-members |accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morten Lilleøren.&lt;ref name="The Lewis Chessmen on a Fantasy Iceland"&gt;Lilleøren, Morten, [http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=7695 The Lewis Chessmen on a Fantasy Iceland] (ChessBase News, 2 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians believe that the Lewis chessmen were hidden (or lost) after some mishap occurred during their carriage from Norway to wealthy Norse towns on the east coast of Ireland, such as [[Dublin]]. The large number of pieces and their lack of wear may suggest that they were the stock of a trader or dealer.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; Along with the chess pieces, there were 14 plain round tablemen for the game of [[Tables (board game)|tables]] and one belt buckle, all made of ivory, making a total of 93 artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Robinson|2004|pp=5, 36, 54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Almost all of the pieces in the collection are carved from walrus ivory, with a few made instead from [[Toothed whales|whale teeth]]. The 78&lt;ref&gt;93 per BM now&lt;/ref&gt; pieces consist of eight [[king (chess)|king]]s, eight [[queen (chess)|queen]]s, 16 [[bishop (chess)|bishop]]s, 15 [[knight (chess)|knight]]s, 12 [[rook (chess)|rook]]s and 19 [[pawn (chess)|pawn]]s.  The heights of the pawns range from 3.5 to 5.8&amp;nbsp;cm, while the other pieces are between 7 and 10.2&amp;nbsp;cm. Although there are 19 pawns (a complete set requires 16), they have the greatest range of sizes of all the pieces, which has suggested that the 78 pieces might belong to at least five sets.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; All the pieces are sculptures of human figures, with the exception of the pawns, which are smaller, geometric shapes.  The knights are mounted on rather diminutive horses and are shown holding spears and shields.  The rooks are standing soldiers or warders holding shields and swords; four of the rooks are shown as wild-eyed [[berserker]]s biting their shields with battle fury.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Some pieces bore traces of red stain when found, indicating that red and white were used to distinguish the two sides, rather than the black and white used in modern chess.&lt;ref name=dlmnyt/&gt;
[[Image:lewis-chessmen08.jpg|thumb|left|The Lewis chessmen in the British Museum]]

Scholars have observed that, to the modern eye, the figural pieces, with their bulging eyes and glum expressions, have a distinct comical character.&lt;ref name="Robinson, pp. 37-41"&gt;Robinson, pp. 37–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Stratford, ''The Lewis chessmen and the enigma of the hoard'' (The British Museum Press, 1997), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true of the single rook with a worried, sideways glance (front right of first image below, next to queen) and the berserkers biting their shields, which have been called "irresistibly comic to a modern audience".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed, however, that the comic or sad expressions were not intended or perceived as such by the makers, to whom these images instead displayed strength, ferocity or, in the case of the queens who hold their heads with a hand and seemingly pensive expression, "contemplation, repose and possibly wisdom".&lt;ref name="Robinson, pp. 37-41"/&gt;

== Modern discovery ==
The chessmen were discovered in early 1831 in a sand bank at the head of [[Camas Uig]] on the west coast of the Isle of Lewis, in the [[Outer Hebrides]] of Scotland.  There are various local stories concerning their arrival and modern discovery on Lewis.

Malcolm "Sprot" MacLeod ({{lang-gd|Calum an Sprot}}) from the nearby [[Ardroil|township of Pennydonald]] discovered the trove in a small stone [[cist|kist]] in a dune, exhibited them briefly in his [[barn|byre]] and sold them on to Captain Roderick Ryrie.&lt;ref name=burn/&gt;  One reported detail, that it was a cow that actually unearthed the stash, is generally discounted in [[Uig, Lewis|Uig]] as fabrication.  After the Isle of Lewis was purchased by Sir [[James Matheson]] in 1844, Malcolm Macleod and his family [[Highland Clearances|were evicted]] and the district was transformed into sheep farms.

== Exhibition and ownership ==
[[File:Lewis chessmen 23.JPG|thumb|A queen and a warder (rook) in the joint exhibition in [[Edinburgh]], 2010]]
They were exhibited by Ryrie at a meeting of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]], on 11 April 1831. The chessmen were soon after split up, with 10 being purchased by [[Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe]] and the others (67 chessmen and 14 [[tables (board game)|tablemen]]) purchased on behalf of the [[British Museum]] in [[London]].

Kirkpatrick Sharpe later found another bishop to take his collection up to eleven, all of which were later sold to [[Albert Denison, 1st Baron Londesborough|Lord Londesborough]]. In 1888, they were again sold, but this time the purchaser was the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]], who donated the pieces to the Royal Scottish Museum in [[Edinburgh]].  The eleven are now on display in the [[National Museum of Scotland]].

Of the pieces given to the British Museum, most can be found in Room 40, with the registration numbers M&amp;ME 1831, 11–1.78–159.  Others have been lent to Scottish museums and temporary exhibitions.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; A range of wooden or plastic replicas are popular items in the Museum shops.

The chessmen were number 5 in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the [[British Museum]] for the 2003 BBC Television documentary ''[[Our Top Ten Treasures]]'', presented by [[Adam Hart-Davis]].  They feature in the 2010 BBC Radio 4 series ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]'' as number 61, in the "Status Symbols" section.

An exhibition entitled "The Lewis Chessmen: Unmasked", which includes chesspieces from both the National Museum of Scotland and British Museum collections, along with other relevant objects, toured Scotland in 2010–2011. The exhibition opened in Edinburgh on 21 May 2010 and proceeded to Aberdeen, [[Shetland]], and the Museum nan Eilean in [[Stornoway]], opening there on 15 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-13085170 "Lewis Chessman exhibition opens in Stornoway museum"]. BBC. Retrieved 15 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition entitled "The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen from the Isle of Lewis" at [[The Cloisters]] in New York City included 34 of the chess pieces, all on loan from the British Museum. The exhibit ended on 22 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/arts/design/the-game-of-kings-medieval-ivory-chessmen-from-the-isle-of-lewis-at-the-cloisters.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=cloisters&amp;st=cse |title=Ken Johnson, "Medieval Foes With Whimsey," New York Times, Nov. 18, 2011 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=18 November 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April 2013, £1.8 million from the European Regional Development Fund was granted to transform [[Lews Castle]], on the Isle of Lewis, into a Museum for the Western Isles. Around £14 million in total is to be spent on restoring and converting the property, which has been shut for almost twenty-five years.  When completed the permanent displays will include six of the Lewis Chessmen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2013/04/investment-in-museum-03042013 "New funding announced for Lews Castle Museum"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispute over location ==
[[Image:Chess01.jpg|thumb|Lewis chessmen in the [[National Museum of Scotland]]]]
In 2007–2008 a dispute arose regarding the most appropriate place to display the pieces. The issue first arose&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/7159656.stm|title=Moves to unite historic chessmen|date=2007-12-24|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; late in 2007 with calls from [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) politicians in the Western Isles (notably Councillor Annie Macdonald, MSP [[Alasdair Allan]] and MP [[Angus MacNeil]]) for the return of the pieces to the place they were found. [[Linda Fabiani]], the Scottish [[Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture]], stated that "it is unacceptable that only 11 Lewis Chessmen rest at the [[National Museum of Scotland]] while the other 67 (as well as the 14 tablemen) remain in the British Museum in London."

[[Richard Oram]], Professor of Medieval and Environmental History at the [[University of Stirling]], agreed, arguing that there was no reason for there to be more than "a sample" of the collection in London.  Both points of view have been dismissed by [[Margaret Hodge]], the UK [[Minister of State]] in the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], writing "It's a lot of nonsense, isn't it?"&lt;ref name=burn&gt;Burnett, Allan (3 February 2008) "Stalemate". Glasgow. ''The Sunday Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The local historical society in Uig, ''Comann Eachdraidh Uig'', which operates a registered museum near the find site featuring detailed information about the chessmen and Norse occupation in Lewis, has indicated publicly that it has no intention of pursuing any claim to the ownership of the pieces and does not support demands for them to be sent to Edinburgh, but would welcome short-term loans.&lt;ref&gt;Uig News, February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, twenty-four of the pieces from London and six from Edinburgh began a 16-month tour of various locations in Scotland. The tour was partly funded by the [[Scottish Government]], and [[Michael Russell (politician)|Mike Russell]], the [[Minister for Culture and External Affairs]], stated that the Government and the British Museum had "agreed to disagree" on their eventual fate. [[Bonnie Greer]], the museum's deputy chairman, said that she "absolutely" believed the main collection should remain in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cornwell |first=Tim |date=2 October 2009 |title=Chessmen 'will never come home' |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/chessmen-will-never-come-home-1-778018 |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Roman religion}}

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], a  '''''lucus''''' is a [[sacred grove]].

''Lucus'' was one of four [[Latin]] words meaning in general "forest, woodland, grove" (along with ''nemus'', ''silva'', and ''saltus''), but unlike the others it was primarily used as a religious designation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Roche, ''Lucan: De Bello Civili, Book 1'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Servius]] defines the ''lucus'' as "a large number of trees with a [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#religio|religious significance]]," as distinguished from the ''silva'', a natural forest, and a ''[[nemus]]'', an [[arboretum]] that is not consecrated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 1.310, ''arborum multitudo cum [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#religio|religione]]''; [[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Religion of the Romans'' (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 275, noting that he finds the distinction "artificial."&lt;/ref&gt; A ''saltus'' usually implied a wilderness area with varied topographical features.

A ''lucus'' was a cultivated place, more like a wooded park than a forest, and might contain an ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]]'', a building that housed the image of a god, or other landscaped features that facilitated or gave rise to ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, ''Religion of the Romans'', pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been conjectured,&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, ''Religion of the Romans'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, that the [[Lupercal]], referred to as a "cave," was a small ''lucus'' with an artificial grotto, since archaeology has uncovered no natural cave in the area.

[[Apuleius]] records that "when pious travelers happen to pass by a sacred grove ''(lucus)'' or a cult place on their way, they are used to make a vow ''([[votum]])'', or a fruit offering, or to sit down for a while."&lt;ref&gt;[[Apuleius]], ''Florides'' 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; What the Romans understood by ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#religio|religio]]'' lay in these ritual gestures, and not in contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Scheid]], "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Some ancient sources as well as modern [[etymology|etymologists]] derive the word  "from a letting in of light" ''(a lucendo)''; that is, the ''lucus'' was the clearing encompassed by trees.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Etymology," in ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old High German]] [[cognate]] ''lôh'' also means "clearing, holy grove." ''Lucus'' appears to have been understood in this sense in [[early medieval literature]]; until the 10th century, it is regularly translated into OHG as ''harug'', a word never used for the secular ''silva''.&lt;ref&gt;D.H. Green, ''Language and History in the Early Germanic World'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998, 2000), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Servius, however, somewhat perversely says that a ''lucus'' is so called because ''non luceat'', "it is not illuminated," perhaps implying that a proper sacred grove hosted only legitimate daytime ceremonies and not dubious nocturnal rites that required torchlight.&lt;ref&gt;''Non quod sint ibi lumina causa religionis'': Servius, note to ''Aeneid'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D1%3Acommline%3D441 1.441]; [[Ken Dowden]], ''European Paganism: The Realities of Cult from Antiquity to the Middle Ages'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==To clear a clearing==
In his book ''[[De Agri Cultura|On Agriculture]]'', [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] records a Roman ritual ''lucum conlucare'', "to clear a clearing." The officiant is instructed to offer a pig as a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#piaculum|piaculum]]'', a [[propitiation]] or [[wikt:expiatory|expiatory offering]] made in advance of the potential wrong committed against the grove through human agency.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The following words are to be formulated ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#verba concepta|verba concipito]])'' for the particular site:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whether thou be god or goddess ''([[Si deus si dea|si deus, si dea]])'' to whom this grove is dedicated, as it is thy right to receive a sacrifice of a pig for the thinning of this sacred grove, and to this intent, whether I or one at my bidding do it, may it be rightly done. To this end, in offering this pig to thee I humbly beg that thou wilt be gracious and merciful to me, to my house and household, and to my children. Wilt thou deign to receive this pig which I offer thee to this end.&lt;ref&gt;Cato, ''On Agriculture'' 139, [[Loeb Classical Library]] translation (1934), Bill Thayer's edition at [[LacusCurtius]]: ''Si deus, si dea es, quoium illud sacrum est, uti tibi ius est porco piaculo facere illiusce sacri coercendi ergo harumque rerum ergo, sive ego sive quis iussu meo fecerit, uti id recte factum siet, eius rei ergo te hoc porco piaculo inmolando bonas preces precor, uti sies volens propitius mihi domo familiaeque meae liberisque meis; harumce rerum ergo macte hoc porco piaculo inmolando esto''; [[Robert E.A. Palmer]], ''The Archaic Community of the Romans'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009), p. 106, connects this ritual to the [[Lucaria]] and the clearing of sacred groves in general.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The word ''piaculum'' is repeated three times in the prayer, emphasizing that the sacrifice of the pig is not a freewill offering, but something owed to the deity by right ''([[ius]])''. The ''piaculum'' compensates the deity for a transgression or offense, and differs from a regular sacrifice offered in the hope of procuring favor in return ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#do ut des|do ut des]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Bailey, ''Phases in the Religion of Ancient Rome'' (University of California, 1932), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is tempting, but misleading, to read [[ecology|ecological]] principles into ritualized agriculture; for the early Romans, respect was the partner of fear in their regard for the divine forces in nature, and the open invocation with which this prayer begins is a contractual "out" or hedge.&lt;ref&gt;J. Donald Hughes, ''The Mediterranean: An Environmental History'' (ABC-Clio, 2005), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''piaculum'' was a guarantee that the action of clearing was valid.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Belayche, "Religious Actors in Daily Life: Practices and Related Beliefs," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thoreau]] nonetheless made admiring reference to Cato's prayer in ''[[Walden]]'': "I would that our farmers when they cut down a forest felt some of that awe which old Romans did when they came to thin, or let in the light to, a consecrated grove ''(lucum conlucare)''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry David Thoreau]], ''Walden'' p. 235 in the edition of [[Bill McKibben]] (Beacon Press, 1997, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival of the grove==
{{Main article|Lucaria}}
The [[Lucaria]] ("Grove Festival") was held on July 19 and 21, according to the ''[[Fasti Amiterni]]'', a [[fasti|calendar]] dating from the reign of [[Tiberius]] found at Amiternum (now S. Vittorino) in [[Sabine]] territory.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, ''Religion of the Romans'', p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacred Groves of the Roman Empire==
A ''lucus'' might become such a focus of activity that a community grew up around it, as was the case with the ''Lucus Augusti'' that is now [[Lugo]] in [[Roman Spain|Spain]] and the ''[[Lucus Feroniae]]'' near [[Capena]].&lt;ref&gt;Dowden, ''European Paganism'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lucus'' is therefore part of the Latin name of several different ancient places in the [[Roman Empire]] from which the modern name derives, including:

*[[Lucus Angitiae]] ("Sacred Grove of [[Angitia]]"), now [[Luco dei Marsi]], a town in [[Italy]]
*[[Lucus Pisaurensis]],&lt;ref&gt;''Lucus Pisaurensis:  Sacred Grove of Pesaro, Discovered by Annibale degli Abati Olivieri'' http://www.ilpignocco.it/en/about-us/lucus-pisaurensis/&lt;/ref&gt; the Sacred Grove of Pesaro, Italy; discovered by [[Annibale degli Abati Olivieri]], an 18th-century Italian aristocrat 
*[[Lucus Augusti (disambiguation)|Lucus Augusti]], the name of multiple sites, such as:
**[[Lugo]], the city in [[Spain]]
**[[Luc-en-Diois]], in [[France]]
*[[Lucus Feroniae]] ("Sacred Grove of [[Feronia (mythology)|Feronia]]") or [[Feronia (Etruria)|Feronia]], a now-disappeared city in [[Etruria]], Italy; see [[Torre di Terracina]], Italy

'''Luksong baka''' ({{lang-en|Jump over the Cow}}) is a [[Traditional games in the Philippines|traditional Filipino game]] that originated from [[Bulacan]]. It involves a minimum of 3 players and a maximum of 10 players and involves them jumping over the person called the ''baka'', the main goal of the players is to successfully jump over the ''baka'' without touching or falling over the ''baka''.

==Rules==
 At the start of the game, there should be one player that should be called ''taya'' (it), or in this game the ''bakang lala'' (cow).
 The players should avoid contact or falling over the ''baka'' player while jumping over.
 The ''baka'' player should start with a [[Kneeling|kneeling-down]] position (a ''baka'' player bends over with their hands placed on his knees).
 All players are to jump over the ''baka'' until all the players have jumped. Once the first set of jumping over the ''baka'' is done, the ''baka'' player's position will slowly rise-up after jumping over the ''baka'' player.
 Only the hands of the jumper may touch the back of the person who is bent over. If a player fails to avoid contact or fall over the ''baka'', they will replace the ''baka'' player with a kneeling position (step 3), and the game continues until the all players decide to end the game.

===Other notes===
* Players should find a safe area to play the game (such as a grassy area) so whenever a player falls, the landing will not cause as many injuries.
* Players should also be fit enough to play in order to jump high, but not that would cause injuries.
* Also, players are recommended to be energetic, especially after a long succession of jumps over the ''baka'' player.
* Players must be cooperative with others and have [[self-confidence]].
* It is recommended that players ask the ''baka'' or ''taya'' to put their head down in avoiding the players' foot hitting the ''baka's'' head.

'''Maya blue''' ({{lang-es|'''azul maya'''}}) is a unique bright [[Azure (color)|azure blue]] [[pigment]] manufactured by cultures of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Aztec]].

==Manufacture==
The Maya blue pigment is a composite of organic and inorganic constituents, primarily [[indigo dye]]s derived from the leaves of ''[[añil]]'' (''Indigofera suffruticosa'') plants combined with [[palygorskite]], a natural clay which, mysteriously, is not known to exist in abundant deposits in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold (2005); Haude (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller trace amounts of other mineral additives have also been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Haude (1997); Reyes-Valerio (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical use==
Maya blue first appeared around 800, and it was still used in the 16th century in several Convents of Colonial Mexico, notably in the paintings of the Indian Juan Gerson in Tecamachalco. These paintings are a clear example of the combination of Indian and European techniques sometimes known as ''[[Arte Indocristiano]]''. After that, the techniques for its production were lost in Mexico, but in Cuba there are examples from as late as 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Chiari (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance to weathering==
Despite time and the harsh weathering conditions, paintings colored by Maya blue have not faded over time. More remarkably, the color has resisted chemical solvents and acids such as nitric acid. Recently, its resistance against  chemical aggression (acids, alkalis, solvents, etc.) and biodegradation was tested, and it was shown that Maya blue is an extremely resistant pigment, but it can be destroyed using very intense acid treatment under reflux.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez del Rio(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on chemical composition==
[[Image:Mic bonampak.gif|thumb|Microscopic image of a mural at [[Bonampak]]]]
[[Image:Mic teotihuacan.gif|thumb|Microscopic image of a mural at [[Teotihuacan]]]]
[[Image:Juangerson.jpg|thumb|Mexican Colonial Painting by [[Juan Gerson]] where Maya blue was used: The technique disappeared in the early colonial period.]]

The chemical composition of the compound was determined by [[powder diffraction]] in the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;Gettens, R. ''J. Am. Antiq.'' '''1962''', 27, 557–564&lt;/ref&gt; and was found to be a composite of [[palygorskite]] and indigo, most likely derived from the leaves of the ''añil''. An actual recipe to reproduce Maya blue pigment was published in 1993 by a Mexican historian and chemist, [[Constantino Reyes-Valerio]]. The combination of different clays (palygorskite and [[montmorillonite]]), together with the use of the leaves of the ''añil'' and the actual process is described in his paper.&lt;ref&gt;Reyes-Valerio, De Bonampak al Templo Mayor, ''La historia del Azul Maya en Mesoamerica,'' Siglo XXI Editores, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Reyes-Valerio's contributions were possibly due to his combined background of history and chemistry, through a thorough revision of primary texts (Sahagun, Hernandez, Jimenez, and others), microscopic analysis of the mural paintings and [[fourier transform infrared spectroscopy]].

After the formula for the production was published in the book ''De Bonampak al Templo Mayor: Historia del Azul Maya en Mesoamerica'', many developments in the chemical analysis of the pigment occurred in collaborations between Reyes-Valerio and European scientists.&lt;ref&gt;notably, Giaccomo Chiari [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/newsletters/19_2/gcinews14.html] from the University of Torino, David Ajò from C.N.R. of Padua and Manuel Sanchez del Rio [http://www.esrf.eu/computing/scientific/people/srio/publications/] from ESRF [http://www.esrf.eu/] in France&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive study on the pigment which describes history, the experimental study techniques (diffraction studies, infrared spectroscopies, [[Raman amplification]], optical spectroscopies, voltammetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and computer modelling), the syntheses, properties and nature of Maya blue and the research in relation with the archaeological and historical contexts has been published in the journal ''Developments in Clay Science''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez del Rio, et al. The Maya Blue Pigment, ''Developments in Clay Science'', Vol. 3., Pages 453–481, {{doi|10.1016/B978-0-444-53607-5.00018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in cultural contexts==
'''[[Pre-Columbian|Pre-Columbian American culture]]'''
* In the [[Americas]], Maya blue was used as a [[colorant]] in [[pre-Columbian]] artworks, [[sculpture]]s, [[mural]]s, and [[Maya textiles|textiles]] (probably), and to illuminate [[Mesoamerican codices]]. For example, many illustrations in the [[Florentine Codex]] written by [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] contain the maya blue color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Colors of the New World|last=Magaloni Kerpel|first=Diana|publisher=The Getty Research Institute|year=2014|isbn=9781606063293|location=Los Angeles|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maya blue may have been used in the [[Grolier Codex]]. Yet there's a dispute about this codex, and whether or not the use of Maya blue has been confirmed.
* Recent research also suggests Maya blue may have played an important role in [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|human sacrifices]] to [[Chaac]] at [[Chichén Itzá]], both produced at the sacrificial site and used to paint the bodies of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Borzo's press release, 26-Feb-2008 [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-02/fm-cmb021808.php] (update when the actual study comes out)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maya blue is associated with the center of a flame. Holding the most heat and therefore the most [[tonalli]], the blue color is considered precious. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Colors of the New World|last=Magaloni Kerpel|first=Diane|publisher=The Getty Research Institute|year=2014|isbn=9781606063293|location=Los Angeles|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Metal Head''''' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[first-person shooter]] [[Mecha simulation game|mecha simulation]] video game developed and published by [[Sega]], and released in 1995 for the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis/Mega Drive]]'s [[Sega 32X|32X]] add-on, allowing for fully [[Texture mapping|texture-mapped]] polygons.&lt;ref&gt;{{MobyGames|id=/metal-head|name=Metal Head}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story ==

Five years after the 'World Federation' was established strife and war are still on the rise.  In order to keep the peace the Federation Armed Forces, part of the Federation Police, build fully armed, bipedal [[Mecha|Mechs]] also known as 'Metal Heads'.  The Metal Head's success causes a heavy militarization of the countries of the Federation.

A sudden and chaotic revolution led by terrorists, armed with their own fully armed Mechs, breaks out and the terrorists take control of a whole country.  The player character (in a Metal Head) is sent in with his team to liberate the country's capital.

The player character starts in a small border town and works his way in to reach the capital.

== Gameplay ==

The game's North American box states "1 or 2 Players", but Sega has confirmed that this was a [[typographical error]] and that ''Metal Head'' is single player only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Metal Head Mistake Caught by Alert Reader|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=71|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 1995|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal Head's levels are broken down into missions, though most of the missions are to destroy all of the enemies in that particular area using the Mech's various projectile weapons.  The time the user have remaining for each mission will count down and is displayed below the power gauge health bar.  Before each mission a talking head appears of presumably one of the superior commanders in the Federation Armed Forces/Federation Police, and will instruct the user of the objective of the mission, which includes full voice-acting. A summary of the current mission will also appear when the game is paused.

Designed for Sega's 6-button controller, the games uses a first-person view looking through the windshield of one of the game's 'Metal Head' mechs.  Below the screen is a control panel displaying the remaining [[Health (game mechanism)|health]] status, represented by a power-gauge and a percentage number, the time the user has remaining for the mission, the weapon the user is currently accessing and a screen displaying various other information for what is required (i.e. a 'miss' when the user does not hit an enemy target).

In the top-right of the quadrant of the screen is a map of the level.  The user's vehicle is represented as a triangle and remaining enemies' vehicles are represented as pulsating circles, which allows navigation throughout each level.

[[File:The Book of Mormon- An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.jpg|thumb|Title page of the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon]]
'''Mormonism''' is the predominant religious tradition of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] of [[Restorationism|Restorationist]] [[Christianity]] started by [[Joseph Smith]] in [[Western New York]] in the 1820s and 30s. After [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith was killed]] in 1844, most Mormons followed [[Brigham Young]] on his westward journey to the area that became the [[Utah Territory]], calling themselves [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). Other sects include [[Mormon fundamentalism]], which seeks to maintain practices and doctrines such as [[plural marriage|polygamy]],&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on a history of Mormon polygamy, see [//www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints "Plural Marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]", lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt; and various other small independent denominations. The second-largest [[List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint denomination]], the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, since 2001 called the [[Community of Christ]], does not describe itself as "Mormon", but instead follows a [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Christian restorationist]] theology, and also considers itself [[Restoration (Latter-day Saints)|Restorationist]] in terms of Latter Day Saint doctrine.

The [[Mormon (word)|word ''Mormon'']] originally derived from the [[Book of Mormon]], a religious text published by Smith, which he said he translated from [[golden plates]] with divine assistance. The book describes itself as a chronicle of early [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] and their dealings with [[God in Mormonism|God]]. Based on the name of that book, early followers of Smith were more widely known as ''Mormons'', and their faith was called ''Mormonism''. The term was initially considered pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/ldsterm.htm Terms used in the LDS Restorationist movement] ReligiousTolerance.org&lt;/ref&gt; but Mormons no longer consider it so (although generally preferring other terms such as Latter-day Saint, or LDS).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= //www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/10/the-importance-of-a-name |title= The Importance of a Name |author= M. Russell Ballard |date= October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormonism shares a common set of beliefs with the rest of the Latter Day Saint movement, including use of and belief in the [[Bible]], as well as in other religious texts including the Book of Mormon and [[Doctrine and Covenants]]. It also accepts the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]] as part of its scriptural canon, and has a history of teaching [[Celestial marriage|eternal marriage]], [[Exaltation (LDS Church)|eternal progression]], and [[Plural marriage|polygamy (plural marriage)]] (although the LDS Church formally abandoned the practice of plural marriage in 1890). [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Cultural Mormonism]], a [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] promoted by Mormon institutions, includes [[cultural Mormon]]s who identify with the culture, but not necessarily with the theology.

{{See also|History of the Latter Day Saint movement|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
[[File:Joseph Smith first vision stained glass.jpg|left|upright|thumb|A stained glass window showing [[Joseph Smith]]'s [[First Vision]].]]
Mormonism originated in the 1820s in western [[New York (state)|New York]] during a period of religious excitement known as the [[Second Great Awakening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=1}}; {{Harvtxt|Shipps|1985|p=36}}; {{Harvtxt|Remini|2002|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After praying about which [[Christian denomination|denomination]] he should join, [[Joseph Smith|Joseph Smith, Jr.]] said he received a vision in the spring of 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Called the "[[First Vision]]", Smith claimed [[God the Father]] instructed him to join none of the existing churches because they were all wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Smith's 1838 written account of this vision was later canonized in a book called ''[[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|The Pearl of Great Price]]''. (See: [[Joseph Smith–History]] 1:19)&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1820s Smith reported several angelic visitations, and was eventually told that God would use him to re-establish the true Christian church, and that the Book of Mormon would be the means of establishing correct doctrine for the restored church. Smith, [[Oliver Cowdery]], and other early followers, began [[baptism|baptizing]] new converts in 1829. Formally organized in 1830 as the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Remini|2002|pp=63, 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was seen by his followers as a modern-day [[prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Smith claimed the [[Book of Mormon]] was translated from writing on [[golden plates]] in a [[reformed Egyptian]] language, translated with the assistance of the [[Urim and Thummim]] and [[Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stones]]. Both the special spectacles and the seer stone were at times referred to as the "[[Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints)|Urim and Thummim]]".&lt;ref name = ldstranslation&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation |title=Book of Mormon Translation |contribution= Book of Mormon Translation |date= n.d. |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5552 |contribution= Book of Mormon Translation By Joseph Smith |pages= 210–213 |last1= Rathbone |first1= Tim |last2= Welch |first2= John W. |author2-link= John W.

Ludlow |year= 1992 |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |location= New York |publisher= [[Macmillan Publishing]] |isbn= 0-02-879602-0 |oclc= 24502140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said an [[Angel Moroni|angel]] first showed him the location of the plates in 1823, buried in a [[Cumorah|nearby hill]], but he was not allowed to take the plates until 1827. Smith began dictating the text of [[The Book of Mormon]] around the fall of 1827 until the summer of 1828 when [[Lost 116 pages|116 pages were lost]]. Translation began again in April 1829 and finished in June 1829,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that he translated it "by the [[Gifts of the Spirit in Mormonism|gift and power of God]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''1''':315; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the translation was completed, Smith said the plates were returned to the angel.  During Smith's supposed possession, [[Book of Mormon witnesses|very few people were allowed to "witness" the plates]].

The book described itself as a chronicle of an early [[Diaspora|Israelite diaspora]], integrating with the pre-existing [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], written by a people called the [[Nephite]]s. According to [[The Book of Mormon]], [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi's]] family left [[Jerusalem]] at the urging of [[God in Mormonism|God]] c. 600 BC, and later sailed to the Americas c. 589 BC. The Nephites are described as descendants of [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]], the fourth son of the prophet [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]]. The Nephites are portrayed as having a belief in [[Jesus|Christ]] hundreds of years before [[Nativity of Jesus|his birth]]. Historical accuracy and veracity of the Book of Mormon was and continues to be [[Criticism of the Book of Mormon|hotly contested]]. No archaeological, linguistic, or other evidence of the use of Egyptian writing in ancient America has been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Standard language references such as Peter T. Daniels and William Bright, eds., ''The World's Writing Systems'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996) (990 pages); David Crystal, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997); and Roger D. Woodard, ed., ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004) (1162 pages) contain no reference to "reformed Egyptian." "Reformed Egyptian" is also ignored in Andrew Robinson, ''Lost Languages: The Enigma of the World's Undeciphered Scripts'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 2002), although it is mentioned in Stephen Williams, ''Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1991). On their website, ''Bad Archaeology'', two British archaeologists, Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews and Dames Doeser, say "The only writing systems to have been recognized in the Americas are those used by the Maya and the Aztecs, neither of which resembles Egyptian hieroglyphs, although Joseph Smith produced a scrap of papyrus containing hieroglyphs he claimed to be a Reformed Egyptian text written by the Patriarch Abraham." [http://www.badarchaeology.com/lost-civilisations/the-lost-tribes-of-israel/ Bad Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid confrontation with New York residents, the members moved to [[Kirtland, Ohio]], and hoped to establish a permanent [[New Jerusalem]] or [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|City of Zion]] in [[Jackson County, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were expelled from Jackson County in 1833 and fled to other parts of Missouri in 1838. [[Mormon War (1838)|Violence]] between the Missourians and church members resulted in the governor of Missouri issuing an "[[Missouri Executive Order 44|extermination order]]," again forcing the church to relocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Remini|2002|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The displaced Mormons fled to Illinois, to a small town called Commerce. The church bought the town, renamed it [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], and lived with a degree of peace and prosperity for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, tensions between Mormons and non-Mormons again escalated, and in 1844 Smith was [[death of Joseph Smith|killed]] by a mob, precipitating a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest group of Mormons (LDS Church) accepted [[Brigham Young]] as the new prophet/leader and emigrated to what became the [[Utah Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, the church began the open practice of [[plural marriage]], a form of [[polygyny]] which Smith had instituted in Nauvoo. Plural marriage became the faith's most sensational characteristic during the 19th century, but vigorous opposition by the [[United States Congress]] threatened the church's existence as a legal institution. Further, polygamy was also a major cause for the opposition to Mormonism in the states of Idaho and Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Groberg|first=Joseph|date=Spring 1976|title=The Mormon Disfranchisements of 1882 to 1892|url=|journal=Brigham Young University Studies|volume= 16| issue =  3|pages=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1890 Manifesto]], church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] announced the official end of plural marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=2}}; {{cite web |url=//www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1 |title=Official Declaration 1 |publisher=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the formal abolition of plural marriage in 1890, several smaller groups of Mormons broke with the LDS Church forming several denominations of [[Mormon fundamentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the LDS Church had become a proponent of [[monogamy]] and [[patriotism]], has extended its reach internationally by a vigorous [[missionary (LDS Church)|missionary]] program, and has grown in size to a reported membership of over 15 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics&lt;/ref&gt; The church is becoming a part of the American and international mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=22}}. "With the consistent encouragement of church leaders, Mormons became models of patriotic, law-abiding citizenship, sometimes seeming to "out-American" all other Americans. Their participation in the full spectrum of national, social, political, economic, and cultural life has been thorough and sincere"&lt;/ref&gt; However, it consciously and intentionally retains its identity as a "peculiar people,"&lt;ref&gt;The term "peculiar people" is consciously borrowed from [//www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.9#8 1 Peter 2:9], and can be interpreted as "special" or "different," though Mormons have certainly been viewed as "peculiar" in the modern sense as well. {{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=60}}; See also: [[Russell M. Nelson]], [//www.lds.org/ensign/1995/05/children-of-the-covenant "Children of the Covenant"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', May 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; believing their unique relationship with God helps save them from [[World|"worldliness"]] (non-spiritual influences).

==Theology==

===Nature of God===
{{main|God in Mormonism}}
Like most other Christian groups, Mormonism teaches that there is [[God the Father|the Father]], [[Son of God (Christianity)|the Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]], but unlike [[Trinitarianism|trinitarian]] faiths, the LDS Church teaches that they are [[Nontrinitarianism|separate and distinct beings]] with the Father and Son having perfected physical bodies and the Holy Ghost having only a body of spirit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/the-godhead&lt;/ref&gt; While the three beings are physically distinct, in Mormon theology they are one in thoughts, actions, and purpose and commonly referred to collectively as the "Godhead".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= //www.lds.org/topics/godhead |title= Godhead |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Hinckley |first= Gordon B. |authorlink= Gordon B. Hinckley |title= In These Three I Believe |url= //www.lds.org/ensign/2006/07/in-these-three-i-believe |date=July 2006 |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Mormonism teaches that God the Father is the literal father of the spirits of all men and women, which existed prior to their mortal existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= //www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/father-in-heaven |title= Father in Heaven |work= lds.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church also believes that a [[Heavenly Mother (Mormonism)|Heavenly Mother]] exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |chapter-url= //www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-2-our-heavenly-family |chapter= Chapter 2: Our Heavenly Family |title= [[Gospel Principles]] |year= 2009 |publisher= [[LDS Church]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer W. Kimball]], [//www.lds.org/ensign/1978/05/the-true-way-of-life-and-salvation "The True Way of Life and Salvation"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', May 1978, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it is believed that all humans as children of God can become [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exalted]], inheriting all that God has, as joint-heirs with Christ, and [[Apotheosis#Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|becoming like him as a God]].&lt;ref&gt;See, Robert L. Millet and Noel B. Reynolds, "Do Latter-day Saints believe that men and women can become gods?," Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship (BYU), No. 5, (found at http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/books/?bookid=45&amp;chapid=534)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorenzo Snow]] is quoted as saying "As man now is God once was: As God now is, man may be."&lt;ref&gt;In Eliza R. Snow Smith, Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow (1884), 46; see also “The Grand Destiny of Man,” Deseret Evening News, July 20, 1901, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===

{{Main|Restoration (Latter Day Saints)}}
Mormonism describes itself as falling within world [[Christianity]], but as a distinct restored [[Dispensation (period)#Latter Day Saint dispensations|dispensation]]; it characterizes itself as the only true form of the Christian religion since the time of a [[Great Apostasy (Latter Day Saints)|Great Apostasy]] that began not long after the [[ascension of Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name = PMG35&gt;{{Citation |author= Missionary Department of the LDS Church |authorlink= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |title= Preach My Gospel |publisher= [[LDS Church]], Inc |year= 2004 |page= 35 |url= //www.lds.org/languages/additionalmanuals/preachgospel/PreachMyGospel___06_03-1_TheRestoration__36617_eng_006.pdf |isbn= 0402366174 }} Mormons believe the Great Apostasy had been foretold by Paul, who knew that the Lord would not come again “except there come a falling away first” (see 2 Thessalonians 2:3)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mormons this Apostasy involved the corruption of the pure, original Christian doctrine with [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and other philosophies,&lt;ref name = GA2&gt;{{Citation |last= Talmage |first= James E. |authorlink= James E. Talmage |title= The Great Apostasy |publisher= The Deseret News |year= 1909 |pages= 64–65 |url= https://archive.org/stream/greatapostasycon00atalm#page/68/mode/2up |isbn= 0875798438}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followers dividing into different ideological groups.&lt;ref name = MARV1&gt;{{Citation |last= Richards |first= LeGrand |authorlink= LeGrand Richards |title= [[A Marvelous Work and a Wonder]] |publisher= Deseret Book Company |year= 1976 |page= 24 |isbn= 0877471614}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, Mormons claim the [[martyr]]dom of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]]
led to the loss of [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood authority]] to administer the Church and its ordinances.&lt;ref name = GA1&gt;{{Citation | last = Talmage | first = James E. | authorlink = James E. Talmage | title = The Great Apostasy | publisher = The Deseret News | year = 1909 | page = 68 | url =https://archive.org/stream/greatapostasycon00atalm#page/68/mode/2up | isbn = 0875798438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Eyring&gt;{{Citation |last= Eyring |first= Henry B. |author-link= Henry B.

Mormons believe that God re-established the [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] Church as found in the [[New Testament]] through Joseph Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Smith's restoration differed significantly from other ''restorationist'' movements of the era (for instance, that of Alexander Campbell). Instead of using Bible analysis, Smith claimed to write and interpret scripture as the biblical prophets did. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Mormons believe that angels such as [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[John the Apostle|John]], and [[John the Baptist]] appeared to Joseph Smith and others and bestowed various [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood]] authorities on them.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_h/1/69-72#69 JSH 1:69,72] and [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/84 Doctrine and Covenants 84:19-21]&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons thus believe that their Church is the "only true and living church" because divine authority was restored to it through Smith. In addition, Mormons believe that Smith and his legitimate successors are modern prophets who receive revelation from God to guide the church. They maintain that other religions have a portion of the truth and are guided by the [[light of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|light of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (book)|Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]] |page= 316 |editor1-first= Joseph Fielding |editor1-last= Smith |editor-link= Joseph Fielding Smith |editor2-first= Richard C. |editor2-last= Galbraith |origyear= 1938 |year= 1993 |isbn= 0-87579-647-8 |ref= harv }} ("Have the Presbyterians any truth? Yes. Have the Baptists, Methodists, etc., any truth? Yes. They all have a little truth mixed with error. We should gather all the good and true principles in the world and treasure them up, or we shall not come out true 'Mormons'.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Religions of the World: A Latter-day Saint View |last1= Palmer |last2= Keller |last3= Choi |last4= Toronto |publisher= Brigham Young University |year= 1997}} (Mormons take an [[Inclusivism|inclusivist]] position that their religion is correct and true but that other religions have genuine value).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===
{{main|Mormon cosmology}}
Smith's cosmology is laid out mostly in Smith's later revelations and sermons, but particularly the [[Book of Abraham]], the [[Book of Moses]], and the [[King Follett discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=64–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mormon cosmology]] presents a unique view of God and the universe, and places a high importance on human agency. In Mormonism, life on earth is just a short part of an eternal existence. Mormons believe that in the beginning, all people existed as [[spirit]]s or "intelligences," in the presence of God.&lt;ref&gt;Mormons differ among themselves about the form of man in the beginning ... but Smith's intention was to assert that some essence of human personality has always existed. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this state, God proposed a [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] whereby they could progress and "have a privilege to advance like himself."&lt;ref&gt;See King Follett discourse and {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spirits were free to accept or reject this plan, and a "third" of them, led by [[Satan]] rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;According to the Book of Moses, Lucifer offered an alternate plan that would guarantee the salvation of ''all'' spirits, however, at the cost of their agency, essentially forcing them to be saved. God's plan allowed spirits the freedom of choice but left room for some to fall out of his presence into darkness. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest accepted the plan, coming to earth and receiving bodies with an understanding that they would experience sin and suffering.

In Mormonism, the central part of God's plan is the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that one purpose of earthly life is to learn to choose good over evil. In this process, people inevitably make mistakes, becoming unworthy to return to the presence of God. Mormons believe that Jesus paid for the sins of the world and that all people can be saved through his atonement.&lt;ref&gt;Nineteenth century Mormonism defined itself against Calvinistic religions that asserted humans' incapacity and utter dependence on the grace of God. Early Mormon preachers emphasized good works and moral obligation; however in the late twentieth century, Mormons pulled back from an "entrenched aversion" to the doctrines of grace, and today have an attitude of trusting in the grace of Christ while trying their best to do good works. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons accept Christ's atonement through faith, repentance, formal covenants or ordinances such as baptism, and consistently trying to live a Christ-like life.

According to Mormon scripture, the Earth's creation was not ''[[ex nihilo]]'', but organized from existing matter. The Earth is just one of many inhabited worlds, and there are many governing heavenly bodies, including the planet or star [[Kolob]], which is said to be nearest the [[throne of God]].

===Ordinances===
In Mormonism, an [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] is a religious [[ritual]] of special significance, often involving the formation of a [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]] with God.&lt;ref&gt; An ordinance is generally a physical act signifying a spiritual commitment or a covenant. Failure to honor that commitment results in the ordinance having no effect. However, sincere repentance can restore the blessings associated with the ordinance.&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinances are performed by the authority of the [[Priesthood (Mormonism)|priesthood]] and in the name of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. The term has a meaning roughly similar to that of the term "[[sacrament]]" in other Christian denominations.

Saving ordinances (or ordinances viewed as necessary for salvation) include: [[Baptism (Latter Day Saints)|baptism]] by [[immersion baptism|immersion]] after the [[age of accountability]] (normally age 8); [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmation]] and reception of the [[Baptism with the Holy Spirit|gift of the Holy Ghost]], performed by laying hands on the head of a newly baptized member; ordination to the [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic]] and [[Melchizedek priesthood]]s for males; an [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]] (including [[washing and anointing]]) received in [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]]; and [[Celestial marriage|marriage]] (or [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing]]) to a spouse.&lt;ref&gt;"[//www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/ordinances "Ordinances]," ''True to the Faith'', (LDS Church, 2004) p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons also perform other ordinances, which include the [[Lord's supper]] (commonly called the [[Sacrament (Latter Day Saints)|sacrament]]), [[naming and blessing children]], giving [[priesthood blessing]]s and [[patriarchal blessings]], [[Anointing of the Sick|anointing and blessing the sick]], participating in [[Prayer circle (Mormonism)|prayer circles]], and [[setting apart]] individuals who are called to church positions.

In Mormonism, the saving ordinances are seen as necessary for salvation, but they are not sufficient in and of themselves. For example, baptism is required for [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]], but simply having been baptized does not guarantee any eternal reward. The baptized person is expected to be obedient to God's commandments, to repent of any sinful conduct subsequent to baptism, and to receive the other saving ordinances.

Because Mormons believe that everyone must receive certain ordinances to be saved, Mormons perform ordinances on behalf of deceased persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ordinances are performed vicariously or by "proxy" on behalf of the dead. In accordance with their belief in each individual's "free agency", living or dead, Mormons believe that the deceased may accept or reject the offered ordinance in the [[spirit world (Latter Day Saints)|spirit world]], just as all spirits decided to accept or reject God's plan originally. In addition, these "conditional" ordinances on behalf of the dead are performed only when a deceased person's genealogical information has been submitted to a temple and correctly processed there before the ordinance ritual is performed. Only ordinances for salvation are performed on behalf of deceased persons. {{nowrap|''See also: [[Baptism for the dead]].''}}

===Scripture===
[[File:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|thumb|upright=0.80|The LDS Church scriptural [[Biblical canon|canon]]]]
Mormons believe in the Old and New Testaments, and the LDS Church uses the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]] as its official scriptural text of the [[Christian biblical canons|Bible]]. While Mormons believe in the general accuracy of the modern day text of the Bible, they also believe that it is incomplete and that errors have been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]'', Macmillan 1992, pp. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Robert J., ''A Bible! A Bible'', Bookcraft, 1990, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= [[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (book)|Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]] |publisher= Deseret Book |year= 1976 |origyear= 1938 |pages= 9–10, 327}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mormon theology, many lost truths are restored in the [[Book of Mormon]], which Mormons hold to be divine scripture and equal in authority to the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]'', Macmillan 1992, pp. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mormon scriptural canon also includes a collection of revelations and writings contained in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] which contains doctrine and prophecy and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]] which addresses briefly Genesis to Exodus. These books, as well as the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]], have varying degrees of acceptance as divine scripture among different denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.

===Revelation===
{{further|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)}}
In Mormonism, [[continuous revelation]] is the principle that God or his divine agents still continue to communicate to mankind. This communication can be manifest in many ways: influences of the [[Holy Ghost]] (the principal form in which this principle is manifest), visions, visitations of divine beings, and others. Joseph Smith used the example of the Lord's revelations to Moses in [[Deuteronomy]] to explain the importance of continuous revelation.

{{quote|text="God said, 'Thou shalt not murder' at another time He said, 'Thou shalt utterly destroy.' This is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted–by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the children of the kingdom are placed. Whatever God commands is right, no matter what it is, although we may not see the reason thereof till long after the events transpire." |sign= [[Joseph Smith]] |source= ''[[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (book)|Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;256–257.}}

Mormons believe that Smith and subsequent church leaders could speak scripture "when moved upon by the Holy Ghost."&lt;ref name="personalrev"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=26}} See also: Doctrine and Covenants 68:4&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many Mormons believe that ancient prophets in other regions of the world received revelations that resulted in additional scriptures that have been lost and may, one day, be forthcoming. In Mormonism, revelation is not limited to church members. For instance, Latter Day Saints believe that the [[United States Constitution]] is a divinely inspired document.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= //www.lds.org/ensign/1992/02/the-divinely-inspired-constitution |title= The Divinely Inspired Constitution |first= Dallin H. |last= Oaks |authorlink= Dallin H. Oaks |date=February 1992 |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' D&amp;C 101:77–80&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons are encouraged to develop a personal relationship with the Holy Ghost and receive personal revelation for their own direction and that of their family.&lt;ref name=personalrev/&gt; The Latter Day Saint concept of revelation includes the belief that revelation from God is available to all those who earnestly seek it with the intent of doing good. It also teaches that everyone is entitled to ''personal'' revelation with respect to his or her [[stewardship (theology)|stewardship]] (leadership responsibility). Thus, parents may receive inspiration from God in raising their families, individuals can receive divine inspiration to help them meet personal challenges, church officers may receive revelation for those whom they serve.

The important consequence of this is that each person may receive confirmation that particular doctrines taught by a prophet are true, as well as gain divine insight in using those truths for their own benefit and eternal progress. In the church, personal revelation is expected and encouraged, and many converts believe that personal revelation from God was instrumental in their conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Continuing Revelation | work=Mormon.org | url=http://www.mormon.org/learn/0,8672,1084-1,00.html | accessdate=August 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its beginnings, the faith has proclaimed itself to be Christ's Church [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restored]] with its original authority, structure and power; maintaining that existing denominations believed in incorrect doctrines and were not acknowledged by God as his church and kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Teaching that existing denominations "were believing in incorrect doctrines, and that none of them was acknowledged by God as his church and kingdom" {{Harvnb|Smith|1842a|p=707}} and "all their creeds were an abomination in his sight." {{Harvnb|Smith|1842c|p=748}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the religion quickly gained a large following of Christian seekers, in the 1830s, many American Christians came to view the church's early doctrines and practices&lt;ref&gt;, the most publicized of which included [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], [[plural marriage]] and the church's [[theodemocracy|theocratic aspirations]] (both now discontinued by the mainstream faith),&lt;/ref&gt; as politically and culturally [[subversion (politics)|subversive]], as well as doctrinally heretical, abominable, and condemnable. This discord led to a series of sometimes-deadly conflicts between Mormons and others who saw themselves as orthodox Christians.&lt;ref&gt;For more information on historical conflicts, see [[History of the Latter Day Saint movement]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although such violence declined during the twentieth century, the religion's unique doctrinal views and practices still generate criticism, sometimes vehemently so. This gives rise to efforts by Mormons and opposing types of Christians to proselytize each other.

Mormons believe in Jesus Christ as the literal [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]] and [[Messiah]], his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] as a conclusion of a [[sin offering]], and subsequent [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/article/what-mormons-believe-about-jesus-christ |title=What Mormons Believe About Jesus Christ—LDS Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.lds.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Latter-day Saints (LDS) reject the ecumenical creeds and the definition of the [[Trinity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_h/1/18-19#18 |title=Joseph Smith History 1:18-19 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= [[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (book)|Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]] |editor-first= Joseph Fielding |editor-last= Smith |editor-link= Joseph Fielding Smith |location= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[Deseret Book]] |year= 1976 |origyear= 1938 |page= 370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (in contrast, the second largest Latter Day Saint denomination, the [[Community of Christ]], is Trinitarian and [[monotheistic]].) Mormons hold the view that the [[New Testament]] prophesied both the [[Great Apostasy|apostasy]] from the teachings of Christ and his apostles as well as the [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restoration]] of all things prior to the second coming of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_thes/2/2-3#2 Thessalonians 2:2-3] and [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/acts/3/19-21#19 Acts 3:19-21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable differences with mainstream Christianity include: A belief that Jesus began his [[Substitutionary atonement|atonement]] in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] and continued it to his crucifixion, rather than the orthodox belief that the crucifixion alone was the physical atonement;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Bruce R. |last= McConkie |url= //www.lds.org/ensign/1985/05/the-purifying-power-of-gethsemane |title= The Purifying Power of Gethsemane |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=May 1985 |page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an afterlife with three [[degrees of glory]], with [[hell]] (often called [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)#Spirit prison|spirit prison]]) being a temporary repository for the wicked between death and the resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Mormon scriptures speak of hell in two ways. The first is another name for [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)#Spirit prison|spirit prison]], a place for the spirits of people who have "died in their sins." The second is a more permanent place called [[Outer Darkness]], reserved for the Devil, his angels, and those who have committed the unpardonable sin.

Much of the Mormon belief system is geographically oriented around the [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]n continents. Mormons believe that the people of the [[Book of Mormon]] lived in the [[western hemisphere]], that Christ appeared in the western hemisphere after his death and resurrection, that the true faith was restored in [[Upstate New York]] by Joseph Smith, that the [[Garden of Eden]] was located in North America, and that the [[New Jerusalem]] would be built in [[Missouri]]. For this and other reasons, including a belief by many Mormons in [[American exceptionalism]], [[Molly Worthen]] speculates that this may be why [[Leo Tolstoy]] described Mormonism as the "quintessential 'American religion'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Molly Worthen|Worthen, Molly]], "[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/06/13/the_missionary_position The Missionary Position]", ''[[Foreign Policy Magazine|Foreign Policy]]'', 13 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to Judaism===
{{See also|Mormonism and Judaism}}
Although Mormons do not claim to be part of [[Judaism]], Mormon theology claims to situate Mormonism within the context of Judaism to an extent that goes beyond what most other Christian denominations claim. The faith incorporates many [[Old Testament]] ideas into its theology, and the beliefs of Mormons sometimes parallel those of Judaism and certain elements of Jewish culture. In the earliest days of Mormonism, Joseph Smith taught that the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] were members of some of the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]]. Later, he taught that Mormons were Israelites, and that they may learn of their tribal affiliation within the twelve Israelite tribes. Members of the LDS Church receive [[Patriarchal blessing]]s which declare the recipient's lineage within one of the tribes of Israel. The lineage is either through true blood-line or adoption. The LDS Church teaches that if one is not a direct descendant of one of the twelve tribes, upon baptism he or she is adopted into one of the tribes. Patriarchal blessings also include personal information which is revealed through a patriarch by the power of the priesthood.

The Mormon affinity for Judaism is expressed by the many references to Judaism in the Mormon liturgy. For example, Smith named the largest Mormon settlement he founded ''[[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]]'', which means "to be beautiful" in [[Hebrew]]. Brigham Young named a tributary of the [[Great Salt Lake]] the "[[Jordan River (Utah)|Jordan River]]". The LDS Church created a writing scheme called the [[Deseret Alphabet]], which was based, in part, on Hebrew. The LDS Church has a [[BYU Jerusalem Center|Jerusalem Center]] in [[Israel]], where students focus their study on Near Eastern history, culture, language, and the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ce.byu.edu/jc/ |title=BYU Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies |publisher=Ce.byu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some controversy involving Jewish groups who see the actions of some elements of Mormonism as offensive. In the 1990s, Jewish groups vocally opposed the LDS practice of [[baptism for the dead]] on behalf of Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]] and Jews in general. According to LDS Church [[general authority]] Monte J. Brough, "Mormons who baptized 380,000 Holocaust victims posthumously were motivated by love and compassion and did not understand their gesture might offend Jews... they did not realize that what they intended as a 'Christian act of service' was 'misguided and insensitive'".&lt;ref&gt;Pyle, Richard. {{cite web|title=Mormons, Jews sign agreement on baptizing Holocaust victims.|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/InfoFiles/ldsagree.html|accessdate=2007-01-04}} AP Newswire, May 5, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that when the dead are baptized through proxy, they have the option of accepting or rejecting the ordinance.

===Relation to Islam===
{{Main|Mormonism and Islam}}
Since its origins in the 19th century, Mormonism has been compared to [[Islam]], often by detractors of one religion or the other.&lt;ref name="mohammed"&gt;[http://www.saintswithouthalos.com/w/1838_tbmoh.phtml Thomas Marsh and Orson Hyde Affidavit], for example; see also [https://www.pbs.org/americanprophet/prologue.html PBS's American Prophet: Prologue] and Todd J. Harris, [http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/1176/ A Comparison of Muhammad and Joseph Smith in the Prophetic Pattern], a thesis submitted for a Master of Arts degree at Brigham Young University in 2007, footnotes on pages 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Joseph Smith]] was referred to as "the modern [[Muhammad|mahomet]]" {{Sic}} by the ''[[New York Herald]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/americanprophet/prologue.html PBS's American Prophet: Prologue].&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after his [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|murder]] in June 1844. This epithet repeated a comparison that had been made from Smith's earliest career,&lt;ref name="mohammed"/&gt; one that was not intended at the time to be complimentary. Comparison of the Mormon and Muslim prophets still occurs today, sometimes for derogatory or [[polemical]] reasons&lt;ref&gt;See, for example:[http://www.inplainsite.org/html/smith_and_muhammed.html Joseph Smith and Muhammad: The Similarities], and Eric Johnson,[http://www.utlm.org/booklist/titles/josephsmithandmuhammad_xb183.htm Joseph Smith and Muhammad], a book published by the "Mormonism Research Ministry" and offered for sale by the anti-Mormon "[http://www.utlm.org/ Utah Lighthouse Ministries]".&lt;/ref&gt; but also for more scholarly (and neutral) purposes.&lt;ref name="mohammed"/&gt; While Mormonism and Islam have many similarities, there are also significant, fundamental differences between the two religions. Mormon–Muslim relations have been historically cordial;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/02/local/me-morlims2 |title=U.S. Muslims and Mormons share deepening ties |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2008-04-02 |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; recent years have seen increasing dialogue between adherents of the two faiths, and cooperation in [[charity (practice)|charitable endeavors]], especially in the [[Middle East|Middle]] and [[Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldmuslimcongress.blogspot.com/2008/04/mormons-muslims.html World Muslim Congress: Mormons and Muslims]; [http://bycommonconsent.com/2007/09/10/mormon-muslim-interfaith-ramadan-dinner-in-washington-dc-area/ Mormon-Muslim Interfaith Ramadan Dinner].&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam and Mormonism both originate in the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic tradition]]s. Each religion sees its founder (Muhammad for Islam, and Joseph Smith for Mormonism) as being a true [[prophet]] of God, called to re-establish the truths of these ancient theological belief systems that have been altered, corrupted, or lost. In addition, both prophets received visits from an angel, leading to additional books of scripture. Both religions share a high emphasis on family life, charitable giving, chastity, abstention from alcohol, and a special reverence for, though not worship of, their founding prophet. Before the [[1890 Manifesto]] against plural marriage, Mormonism and Islam also shared in the belief in and practice of plural marriage, a practice now held in common by Islam and various branches of Mormon fundamentalism.

The religions differ significantly in their views on God. Islam insists upon the complete [[Tawheed|oneness]] and uniqueness of [[God]] ([[Allah]]), while Mormonism asserts that the [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]] is made up of three distinct "personages."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Godhead Encyclopedia of Mormonism], entry: "Godhead".&lt;/ref&gt;
Mormonism sees Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah and the literal Son of God, while Islam insists that the title "Messiah" means that Jesus (or "[[Jesus in Islam|Isa]]") was a prophet sent to establish the true faith, not that he was the Son of God or a divine being. Despite opposition from other [[Christian denominations]], Mormonism identifies itself as a Christian religion, the "restoration" of primitive Christianity. Islam does not refer to itself as "Christian", asserting that Jesus and all true followers of Christ's teachings were (and are) Muslims–a term that means ''submitters to God''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islam-voice.net/jesus-was-muslim.html Jesus Was Muslim] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818170005/http://islam-voice.net/jesus-was-muslim.html |date=2011-08-18 }}, from the [http://islam-voice.net/ Islam-Voice] website.&lt;/ref&gt; Islam proclaims that its [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] Muhammad was the "seal of the prophets",&lt;ref&gt;Holy Qur'an, Surah 33, verse 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and that no further prophets would come after him. Mormons, though honoring Joseph Smith as the first prophet in modern times, see him as just one in a long line of prophets, with Jesus Christ being the premier figure of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=8}} ("In the Mormon view, many prophets preceded Smith and many will follow.") In that sense, a provision for [[Continuous revelation|continuing revelation]], Mormonism is more similar to [[Shia Islam]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological divisions==
Mormon theology includes three main movements. By far the largest of these is "mainstream Mormonism", defined by the leadership of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). The two broad movements outside mainstream Mormonism are [[Mormon fundamentalism]], and liberal reformist Mormonism.

===Mainstream Mormon theology===
{{See also|Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
Mainstream Mormonism is defined by the leadership of the LDS Church which identifies itself as Christian.&lt;ref name = aremormonschristian/&gt; Members of the LDS Church consider their top leaders to be prophets and [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]]s, and are encouraged to accept their positions on matters of theology, while seeking confirmation of them through personal study of the Book of Mormon and the Bible. Personal prayer is encouraged as well. The LDS Church is by far the largest branch of Mormonism. It has continuously existed since the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] of 1844 that split the Latter Day Saint movement after the death of founder Joseph Smith, Jr.

The LDS Church seeks to distance itself from other branches of Mormonism, particularly those that practice polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;The LDS Church encourages journalists not to use the word ''Mormon'' in reference to organizations or people that practice polygamy {{cite web |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/style-guide |title=Style Guide—LDS Newsroom |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=November 11, 2011}}; The church repudiates polygamist groups and excommunicates their members if discovered {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=91}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25396937/ns/us_news-faith/t/mormons-seek-distance-polygamist-sects |title=Mormons seek distance from polygamous sects |year=2008 |publisher=msnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The church maintains a degree of orthodoxy by excommunicating or disciplining its members who take positions or engage in practices viewed as apostasy. For example, the LDS Church excommunicates members who practice polygamy or who adopt the beliefs and practices of Mormon fundamentalism.

===Mormon fundamentalism===
{{Main|Mormon fundamentalism}}
One way Mormon fundamentalism distinguishes itself from mainstream Mormonism is through the practice of [[plural marriage]]. Fundamentalists initially broke from the LDS Church after that doctrine was discontinued around the beginning of the 20th century. Mormon fundamentalism teaches that plural marriage is a requirement for [[Exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]] (the highest degree of salvation), which will allow them to live as gods and goddesses in the afterlife. Mainstream Mormons, by contrast, believe that a single [[Celestial marriage]] is necessary for exaltation.

In distinction with the LDS Church, Mormon fundamentalists also often believe in a number of other doctrines taught and practiced by [[Brigham Young]] in the 19th century, which the LDS Church has either abandoned, repudiated, or put in abeyance. These include:
*the [[law of consecration]] also known as the [[United Order]] (put in abeyance by the LDS Church in the 19th century);
*the [[Adam–God theory|Adam–God teachings]] taught by Brigham Young and other early leaders of the LDS Church (repudiated by the LDS Church in the mid-20th century);
*the principle of [[blood atonement]] (repudiated by the LDS Church in the mid-20th century); and
*the [[Black people and Mormonism|exclusion of black men]] from the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] (abandoned by the LDS Church in 1978).

Mormon fundamentalists believe that these principles were wrongly abandoned or changed by the LDS Church, in large part due to the desire of its leadership and members to assimilate into mainstream American society and avoid the persecutions and conflict that had characterized the church throughout its early years. Others believe that it was a necessity at some point for "a restoration of all things" to be a truly restored Church.

===Liberal reformist theology===
{{see also|Bickertonite}}
Some LDS Church members have worked towards a more liberal reform of the church. Others have left the LDS Church and still consider themselves to be [[cultural Mormon]]s. Others have formed new religions (many of them now defunct). For instance the [[Godbeites]] broke away from the LDS Church in the late 19th century, on the basis of both political and religious liberalism, and in 1985 the [[Restoration Church of Jesus Christ]] broke away from the LDS Church as an [[LGBT]]-friendly denomination, which was formally dissolved in 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1041">A '''race clock''' (also called a '''display clock''') is [[sports equipment]] with an [[Fourteen-segment display | alpha numeric display]] that typically shows the elapsed time for a [[Racing|race]] or sporting event.

A race clock may be positioned at the finish line of a race or at various key intermediate locations (split points) so that athletes will know their pace.  The display is typically either [[light emitting diode]]s or plastic elements that can be flipped to reveal or hide a surface painted with a bright color.  The digits on a race clock vary in sizes from 6 inches to a foot in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raceclock.com/|title=Sports Timing Equipment|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clock can be either a free standing piece of equipment on a tripod or finish truss or can be incorporated into a larger [[scoreboard]] display.

A '''rivethead''' or '''rivet head''' is a person associated with the &lt;!-- DON'T RENAME "INDUSTRIAL DANCE" TO "INDUSTRIAL". INDUSTRIAL DANCE IS THE CORRECT HISTORICAL TERM OF THE 80s MUSIC SCENE --&gt;[[industrial dance music]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren M. E. Goodlad, Michael Bibby: ''Goth. Undead subculture'', Duke University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0822339212}}, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In stark contrast to the original [[Industrial music|industrial culture]], whose performers and heterogeneous audience were sometimes referred to as "industrialists", the rivethead scene is a coherent [[youth culture]] closely linked to a discernible fashion style. The scene and its dress code emerged in the late 1980s&lt;ref name=steele&gt;Steele, Valerie (2008). Gothic: Dark Glamour. Yale University Press. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of [[electro-industrial]], [[Electronic body music|EBM]], and [[Industrial metal|industrial rock]] music. The associated dress style draws on military fashion and [[Punk fashion|punk aesthetics]]&lt;ref name="undead69"&gt;Lauren M. E. Goodlad, Michael Bibby: ''Goth. Undead subculture'', Duke University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0822339212}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; with hints of [[fetish fashion|fetish wear]], mainly inspired by the scene's musical protagonists.

== Origins of the term ==
Initially, the term ''rivethead'' had been used since the 1940s as a nickname for North American [[Automotive industry|automotive]] [[assembly line]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=63710 |title= Rivethead @ Everything2.com |publisher= [Welcome to Everything @ Everything2.com] |accessdate= 2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and steel construction workers&lt;ref name=stevens&gt;Kate Stevens: ''Freak Nation: A Field Guide to 101 of the most odd, extreme, and outrageous American subcultures'', Adams Media, November 2010, {{ISBN|978-1440506468}}, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; and hit the mainstream through the publication of [[Ben Hamper]]'s ''Rivethead: Tales From the Assembly Line'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.michaelmoore.com/hamper |title= Ben Hamper |publisher= [Welcome to MichaelMoore.com] |accessdate= 2007-08-23 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070921005250/http://www.michaelmoore.com/hamper/ |archivedate= 2007-09-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is otherwise unrelated to the subculture.

Glenn Chase, founder of San Diego label [[Re-Constriction Records]], is responsible for the term's meaning in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.re-constriction.com |title= Re-Constriction |publisher= [Cargoland!] |accessdate= 2007-09-11 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930021047/http://www.re-constriction.com/ |archivedate= 2007-09-30 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, he released ''Rivet Head Culture'', a compilation that contains several electro-industrial and industrial rock acts from the Canadian and U.S.-American [[underground music]] scene. In the same year, industrial rock group [[Chemlab]] − whose members were close friends of Chase − had released their debut album ''[[Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/Chemlab-Burn-Out-At-The-Hydrogen-Bar/master/29652 Chemlab: Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar] @ Discogs.com&lt;/ref&gt; which includes a track called ''Rivet Head''. Chemlab singer Jared Louche said he did not remember where the term came from, although he stated that this song title was in his mind for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regenmag.com/index.php?module=pagesetter&amp;func=viewpub&amp;tid=3&amp;pid=35 | title= Chemlab - Teaching you how to bleed|author= pHil|date= 2006-02-24|publisher= ReGen Magazine :: Industrial, synthpop, electronic, alternative music |accessdate= 2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==
The rivethead scene is remotely related but not directly connected to the industrial music culture. [[Industrial music]] is a genre of experimental and avantgardist music, intertwined with graphical visualization (mostly with disturbing graphical content).&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher; Moberg, Marcus: ''Industrial, Post-industrial and Neofolk music'', The Bloomsbury Handbook of Popular Music, Bloomsbury Academic 2017, {{ISBN|1-474-23733-9}}, p. 206&lt;br /&gt;''"From the early 1980s onwards industrial music as represented by Throbbing Gristle influenced and was fused with other musical styles, resulting in what can be termed 'post-industrial styles'."''&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of conventional song structures, such as rhythm and melody, is a main characteristic of the genre, whereas the music preferred by the rivethead scene includes several danceable and song-oriented styles that are sometimes considered ''"post-industrial"''.&lt;ref name="Bloomsbury"&gt;Partridge, Christopher; Moberg, Marcus: ''Industrial, Post-industrial and Neofolk music'', The Bloomsbury Handbook of Popular Music, Bloomsbury Academic 2017, {{ISBN|1-474-23733-9}}, p. 206&lt;br /&gt;''"From the early 1980s onwards industrial music as represented by Throbbing Gristle influenced and was fused with other musical styles, resulting in what can be termed 'post-industrial styles'."''&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[post-punk]], the term ''post-industrial'' describes a musical genre that developed distinctly from its roots and turned into several strands of sound, namely [[electro-industrial]], [[electronic body music]], and [[Industrial metal|industrial rock]], often referred to as [[industrial dance music]]. Those styles differ from traditional industrial music regarding aesthetics, sound, and production techniques.&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;Reed, Alexander: ''Assimilate: A Critical History of Industrial Music'', Oxford University Press, 2013, {{ISBN|0-199-83260-9}}, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomsbury"&gt;Partridge, Christopher; Moberg, Marcus: ''Industrial, Post-industrial and Neofolk music'', The Bloomsbury Handbook of Popular Music, Bloomsbury Academic 2017, {{ISBN|1-474-23733-9}}, p. 206&lt;br /&gt;''"From the early 1980s onwards industrial music as represented by Throbbing Gristle influenced and was fused with other musical styles, resulting in what can be termed 'post-industrial styles'."''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aesthetics ==
The rivethead dress style has been inspired by [[military]] [[aesthetic]]s, complemented by fashion "that mimics the grit and grime of industrial sectors in major metropolitan areas"''.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.yahoo.com/the-fashion-culture-industrial-3800354.html?cat=46 The Fashion and Culture of the Industrial Music Scene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020035514/http://voices.yahoo.com/the-fashion-culture-industrial-3800354.html?cat=46 |date=2012-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it borrows elements of punk fashion, such as a fanned and dyed [[Mohawk hairstyle]],&lt;ref name="undead69" /&gt; and [[fetish fashion|fetish wear]] such as black leather and PVC tops, pants and shorts (primarily worn by females), partly supplemented with [[modern primitive]] body modifications such as [[tattoo]]s and [[Body piercing|piercings]].

Occasionally, rivetheads emphasize a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]], [[dystopia]]n influence, often inspired by movies, e.g. ''[[Mad Max]]'' (1979), ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981), ''[[Gunhed (film)|Gunhed]]'' (1989), ''[[Death Machine]]'' (1994), and ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'' (1995). Several movies, such as ''[[Hardware (film)|Hardware]]'' (1990), ''Strange Days'' and ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' (1995), feature music tracks by [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[KMFDM]], [[Diatribe (band)|Diatribe]], [[Stabbing Westward]] and other bands associated with the rivethead culture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099740/soundtrack Internet Movie Database (IMDb): ''Hardware / M.A.R.K. 13'', OST]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114558/soundtrack Internet Movie Database (IMDb): ''Strange Days'', OST]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113481/soundtrack Internet Movie Database (IMDb): ''Johnny Mnemonic'', OST]&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences include sci-fi archetypes such as [[Lupus Yonderboy]] of the [[Neuromancer|Panther Moderns]] and [[Molly Millions|Razorgirl]] from the [[cyberpunk]] literature (characters from the [[Sprawl trilogy]] by [[William Gibson]]).
[[File:Sascha.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Sascha Konietzko]], one of the most influential persons in the rivethead music scene since the 1990s, both musically and visually.]]

Below some basic characteristics of the rivethead dress style. As a divergence from the extravagance of youth cultures such as [[New Romanticism|New Romantic]], [[Goth subculture|goth]], [[Cybergoth|cyber]], and [[steampunk]], the idea is to make a statement with as few fashion components as possible. The rivethead look commonly is unadorned and epitomizes a direct reflection of the social environment ("street survival wear"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan S. Epstein / David A. Locher: ''Youth Culture. Identity in a postmodern world'', Wiley-Blackwell Publishers, 1998, {{ISBN|1-55786-851-4}}, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Male ===
* '''Tops''': Black, gray or olive [[Sleeveless shirt#A-shirt|tank tops]],&lt;ref name="Epstein/Locher"&gt;Jonathan S. Epstein / David A. Locher: ''Youth Culture. Identity in a postmodern world'', Wiley-Blackwell Publishers, 1998, {{ISBN|1-55786-851-4}}, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; plain [[t-shirt]]s, band shirts, sleeveless shirts (sometimes with the sleeves ripped off), [[tie-dye]] crinkle or burst pattern shirts; black [[leather jacket]]s (frequently painted with band [[logo]]s), and MA-1 [[flight jacket]]s.&lt;ref name="Digitalis"&gt;Raven Digitalis: ''Goth Craft. The Magickal Side of Dark Culture'', Llewellyn Worldwide, 2007, {{ISBN|9780738711041}}, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Pants''': [[Cargo pants|Cargo]] and [[Battle Dress Uniform|BDU]] paratrooper pants, ripped jeans, vintage shorts, often but not always black or [[M81 Woodland|Woodland camouflage]]; usually tucked into boots, rolled at the bottom cuffs or worn as cut-off shorts. Black leather pants and bondage pants are sometimes worn.&lt;ref name="undead76"&gt;Lauren M. E. Goodlad, Michael Bibby: ''Goth. Undead subculture'', Duke University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0822339212}}, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Footwear''': [[Combat boot]]s,&lt;ref name="Epstein/Locher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="undead76" /&gt; [[steel-toe boots]] or low shoes, such as [[Dr. Martens]], Gripfasts, [[Grinders (footwear)|Grinders]] and Underground shoes.
* '''Hair''': Partially shaved ([[Undercut (hairstyle)|undercut]]), [[flattop]], [[Mohawk hairstyle|Mohawk]] or completely [[head shaving|shaved]]. Sometimes long hair in combination with undercut or [[dreadlocks]].
* '''Accessories''': [[Teashades]] and [[Ray-Ban Aviator]] sunglasses. Battle Dress Uniform-style or military belts; bracelets and [[dog tag]]s; fingerless leather gloves; sometimes jewelry that incorporates industrial elements such as nails, screws and cogs. Suspenders, or "braces", normally worn hanging off trousers or shorts.
* '''Body modification''': Primarily piercings and tattoos.

=== Female ===
Rivetgirls may dress along with the ''[[femme fatale]]'' look: [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] as power. Common are fetish wear, such as black [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and [[leather]] [[Corsage (bodice)|corsages]], [[miniskirt]]s, ankle-deep or knee-high [[stiletto heel]] boots;&lt;ref name=stevens /&gt; less makeup than Goths&lt;ref name="undead69" /&gt; and 1980s New Wave fashion girls, who were also an influence on the late-1980s/early 1990s rivetgirl style (cf. fishnet tights, stilettos, Dr. Martens low boots). Often dyed hair (black, sometimes red or blonde) that is long, short, spiked, partially shaved (see [[Maria Azevedo]] of [[Battery (electro-industrial band)|Battery]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?artist=Maria+Azevedo Photo of Maria Azevedo (Battery)] @ http://www.discogs.com; picture was taken in 1996/97 (COP International promotion picture)&lt;/ref&gt; and Yone Dudas of [[Decoded Feedback]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://noif.ru/uploads/posts/1221575839_219ffc61e87f69ecc6bf78e65891b481_feedback1.jpg Photo of Yone Dudas (Decoded Feedback)]; picture was taken in the mid-/late-1990s (Zoth Ommog promotion picture)&lt;/ref&gt;) or dreadlocked (see Anna Christine of Luxt&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?artist=Anna+Christine Photo of Anna Christine (Luxt)] @ http://www.discogs.com&lt;/ref&gt;). On the other hand, the female rivethead fashion look may be and often is identical to the tough style of the male rivetheads ([[Tank Girl]] aesthetic; military wear&lt;ref name=stevens /&gt; such as tank tops, paratrooper pants and combat boots&lt;ref name="undead69" /&gt;). Kim X, co-founder of California-based music label [[COP International]], compared the female rivethead attitude to the [[Riot grrrl]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Side-Line music magazine: ''Dossier. Diva X Machina'', issue 1/1997, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|“Women involved in the 'Industrial scene' wore less makeup, particularly less elaborate eye makeup. They also adopted a much more traditional Punk look, with shorter skirts, made of leather or vinyl, and combat boots. Because of the athletics required of 'Industrial' dancing, it was rare to see women in this scene with spike heels, as it would constrain their movement on the dance floor. The male 'Industrial style' also was much closer to Punk, with men wearing shorts, big boots and adopting partially shaved hairstyles.”&lt;br /&gt;{{Nb10}}– Kristen Schilt, sociologist at the [[University of Chicago]]&lt;ref name="undead69" /&gt;}}

== Comparison with goth subculture ==
The rivethead scene of the 1980s and 1990s was different from the [[goth subculture]] in ideological and musical terms, as well as in their visual aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Liisa Ladouceur, Gary Pullin: ''Encyclopaedia Gothica'', ECW Press, 2011, {{ISBN|9781770410244}}, p. 232f&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion regarding the boundaries of those two youth cultures has heightened because of the late-1990s "multi-subcultural" cross-hybridization, which led people to incorrectly believe that rivetheads are an offshoot of the goth subculture. Canadian novelist and author [[Nancy Kilpatrick]] labelled this youth-cultural overlap "industrial goth",&lt;ref&gt;Kilpatrick, Nancy (2004). ''The Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined.'' New York: St. Martin's Griffin, p. 23; 33-4.&lt;/ref&gt; as does Julia Borden.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; ( − ''Note'': In the heyday of the rivethead culture, the term "industrial goth" as a description of a youth culture did not exist).&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dave (2000). ''Alternative Rock.'' San Francisco, CA: Miller Freeman Books, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Digitalis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire (2004). ''What is Goth?'' York Beach, ME: Weiser Books, p. 06.&lt;/ref&gt;


{{quote|“The 'Industrial look' began to emerge in the late 1980s. […] The typical 'Industrial' guy, circa 1989, was a Punk who liked technology.”&lt;br /&gt;{{Nb10}}– Julia Borden&lt;ref name=steele/&gt;}}

{{quote|“In contrast to the old-style Goth look, which was androgynous, the male 'Industrial look' was tough and military, with a sci-fi edge. The men wore […] band T-shirts, black trousers or military cargo pants in black, military accessories, such as dog-tags, heavy boots […] 'Industrial' women, who were fewer in number, tended to wear waist-cinching [[corset]]s, small tank tops or 'wife-beaters' [sleeveless t-shirts], trousers, and sometimes suspenders hanging down off the pants. They also […] sometimes shaved their heads.”&lt;br /&gt;{{Nb10}}– [[Valerie Steele]], fashion historian and director of [[Fashion Institute of Technology#The Museum at FIT|MFIT]], New York.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt;}}

{{quote|“Stylistically, both men and women in the Gothic subculture […] rely heavily on feminine signifiers, such as makeup, skirts and corsets, while the 'Industrial scene' adopts a much more masculine style that incorporates more traditional Punk elements, such as combat boots and leather pants. […] Unlike their Gothic counterparts, the male ‘Industrials’ did not wear makeup.”&lt;br /&gt;{{Nb10}}– Kristen Schilt, sociologist at the [[University of Chicago]]&lt;ref name="undead76" /&gt;&lt;ref name="undead69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="undead72"&gt;Lauren M.

{{quote|“Gothic expresses the emotional, beautiful, supernatural, feminine, poetic, theatrical side. Industrial embodies the masculine, angry, aggressive, noisy, scientific, technological, political side.

It tends to be male-dominated in those who make the music and those who enjoy it.”&lt;ref name=study&gt;[http://www.gothicsubculture.com/music-description.php A Study of Gothic Subculture]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[musicologist]] Bret D. Woods in his master's thesis about industrial music"

{{quote|“It is […] important to note that some industrial artists use [[Marxist]], [[socialist]], and/or [[communist]] imagery in a shocking and satirical way to represent [[tyranny]] and their protest against tyranny.

[[Image:Sarungan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Java]]nese men often wear sarongs during religious or casual occasions. [[Surabaya]], [[East Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]

A '''sarong''' or '''sarung''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|ŋ}}; [[Malay language|Malay]]: {{IPA-may|ˈsaroŋ|}}, [[Indonesian language|formal Indonesian]]: {{IPA-may|ˈsaruŋ|}}, [[Indonesian language#Colloquial Indonesian|colloquial Indonesian]]: {{IPA-may|ˈsarʊŋ|}}, [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: சரம், [[Arabic]]: صارون, [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]: සරම; meaning "''[[Scabbard|sheath]]''" in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language|Malay]]) is a large tube or length of [[textile|fabric]], often wrapped around the waist, worn in [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[East Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.selyn.lk/single-post/2016/02/25/Sarong-from-ancient-times-to-the-present|title=Selyn - Fair Trade Handlooms|author=|date=|website=Selyn - Fair Trade Handlooms|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on many [[Pacific island]]s. The fabric often has woven [[plaid (pattern)|plaid]] or checkered patterns, or may be brightly colored by means of [[batik]] or [[ikat]] [[dyeing]]. Many modern sarongs have [[printed]] designs, often depicting [[animal]]s or [[plant]]s. Different types of sarongs are worn in different places in the world, notably, the [[lungi]] in India and the [[izaar]] in the Arabian Peninsula.

== Overview ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Sarongweefster uit Bandoeng Java TMnr 10014439.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] sarong [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]] in [[Bandung]], [[West Java]], [[Dutch East Indies]], 1900–1940.]]

[[File:Chau Doc textile.jpg|thumb|Sarung denotes a length of fabric as a [[garment]].]]
''Sarong'' or "sarung"  denotes the lower garment worn by the Indonesian (and other [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]n) men. This consists of length of fabric about a yard (0.91 m) wide and two-and-a-half yards (2.3 m) long. In the center of this sheet, across the narrower width, a panel of contrasting color or pattern about one foot wide is woven or dyed into the fabric, which is known as the ''kepala'' or "head" of the sarong. This sheet is stitched at the narrower edges to form a tube. One steps into this tube, brings the upper edge above the level of the navel (the hem should be level with the ankles), positions the ''kepala'' at the center of the back, and folds in the excess fabric from both sides to the front center, where they overlap and secures the sarong by rolling the upper hem down over itself. Malay men wear sarongs woven in a check pattern; women wear sarongs dyed in the [[batik]] method, with, for example, flower motifs, and in brighter colors.  However, in [[Javanese people|Javanese culture]], the wearing of batik sarung is not restricted to women on formal occasions such as weddings.

The sarong is common wear for women, in formal settings with a ''[[kebaya]]'' blouse. Malay men wear sarongs in public only when attending Friday prayers at the [[mosque]], but sarongs remain very common casual wear at home for men of all ethnicities and religions in [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Sarong#Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], and much of the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=manipur.Sports_and_Manipur.Indigenous_Games_between_Cambodia_and_Manipur |title=Singh, Atom Sunil; "Indigenous Games between Cambodia and Manipur: A Borderless Connectivity" |work=E-pao.net |date= |accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In South Asia, excluding Sri Lanka, sarongs are typically known as ''[[mundu]]'' or ''[[lungi]]'').

==Regional variations==

=== Arabian Peninsula ===
{{Main article|Izaar}} [[Image:Bayt al-Faqih market.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yemen]]i men in traditional sarongs.]]
[[Image:Bait al-Faqih.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yemen]]i man tying his ''futah'' (sarong). Sometimes people keep money and other small utensils in the folds of the futah.]]

Sarongs known under a variety of local names are traditionally worn by the people of [[Yemen]] and elsewhere on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Local names for the garment include ''fūṭah'', ''[[izaar]]'', ''wizār'' and ''maʿwaz'' (pl. ''maʿāwiz''). In [[Hadhramawt]] sarong is called ''ṣārūn'' in the interior and ''ṣārūm'' in the coastal region. In [[Oman]], sarongs are called ''wizār'' and are often white in color, similar to the [[Kerala]]n ''[[mundu]]'' of [[South Asia]] and it is usually worn under the [[Thawb]]. In [[Saudi Arabia]], sarongs are known as [[izaar]]. Designs can be checkered or striped as well floral or [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], but double plaid (i.e., a vertical section of the ''izār'' with a different plaid pattern) designs from [[Indonesia]] are also very popular. In southwestern Saudi Arabia, tribal groups have their own style of unstitched izaar, which is locally woven. This is also worn in northern Yemen. However, the tribal groups in Yemen each have their own design for their ''fūṭah'', the latter of which may include tassels and fringes. It is thought that these tribal futah resemble the original izaar as worn on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] since pre-Islamic times such as the [[Shendyt]]. They are generally worn open and unstitched in such a way that the garment does not reach over one's ankles. Other izaars, often imported from Bangladesh, are the traditional clothing of [[Arab]] fishermen of the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. It was the traditional garment for men before the introduction of pant-like pyjamas and [[kaftan]]s during the Turkish and European colonial periods. Tube-stitched as well as open sarongs are both worn, even in formal [[Thawb|dishdasha]]-wearing countries, as casual sleep wear and at home.

===South Asia===
[[Image:LungiBoypagne.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bangladesh]]i boy in a traditional [[lungi]].]]
{{Main article|Lungi}}
Sarongs, very similar to those of South-East Asia and completely different from South Asia are widespread – in the state of [[Manipur]], where they are called ''[[Phanek]]'' and ''[[Mekhela]]'' in [[Assam]] which are very similar to traditional attires of other South-East Asian nations. In the South [[India]]n states of [[Kerala]], where they are called ''[[mundu]]'' (if fully white or fully black) and ''[[lungi]]'' or ''[[lungi|kaili]]'' if coloured, and [[Tamil Nadu]], where they are called ''[[lungi|kaili]]'' or ''[[lungi|saaram]]'' or ''[[veshti|vetti]]'' or ''[[lungi]]'' and are usually worn at home. A standard lungi measures 2.12 by 1.2 metres.

Unlike the brightly colored Southeast Asian sarongs, the Kerala variety (the mundu) is more often plain white and is worn for ceremonial or religious purposes. In Kerala, the brightly coloured sarongs are called ''kaily'' and the white ones are called mundu. The more formal, all-white [[dhoti]] is worn for formal and religious occasions. While there are dresses based on the mundu which can be worn by women, they more commonly wear the [[sari]].

==== Sri Lanka ====
Sarongs are very common in [[Sri Lanka]] and worn only by men. (A similar garment is worn by women. However, the women's garment is called "redda", which is wraparound skirt.) It is the standard garment for most men in rural and even some urban communities. However, most men of upper social classes (whose public attire is trousers) wear the sarong only as a convenient night garment or only within the confines of the house.

Statistically, the number of people wearing sarong as their primary public attire is on the decline in [[Sri Lanka]]; the reason being that the sarong carries the stigma of being the attire for less educated lower social classes. However, there is a trend toward adopting sarong as a fashionable garment or as a formal garment worn with national pride, only on special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.travelsrilanka.com/index.cfm?PAGE=1176  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007044002/http://www.travelsrilanka.com/index.cfm?PAGE=1176 |date=October 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Political and social leaders of Sri Lanka who want to portray their humility and closeness to "common man" and their nationalism, choose a variation of the sarong nicknamed the "national" as their public attire.

=== Horn of Africa ===
[[File:Old man in Harar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Somali people|Somali]] man wearing a ''macawiis'' sarong.]]
Sarongs are ubiquitous in [[Somalia]] and the [[Muslim]]-inhabited areas of the [[Horn of Africa]]. Although [[nomad]]ic and urban [[Somali people|Somali]] men have worn them for centuries in the form of a plain white [[skirt]], the colorful ''macawiis'' (ma'awiis) sarong, which is the most popular form of the garment in the region, is a relatively recent arrival to Somalia courtesy of trade with the [[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian islands]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Before the 1940s, most macawiis were made of [[cotton]]. However, since the industrialization of the market for sarongs, they now come in many fabrics and combinations thereof, including [[polyester]], [[nylon]] and [[silk]].

Designs vary greatly and range from checkered square motifs with watermarked diamonds and [[plaid (pattern)|plaid]] to simple geometric lines. The one constant is that they tend to be quite colorful; black macawiis are rare. Sarongs in Somalia are worn around the waist and folded several times over to secure their position. They are typically sold pre-sewn as one long circular stretch of cloth, though some vendors offer to sew them as a [[value-added]] service.

===Western world===
In North and South America as well as Europe, hip wraps are worn as beach wear or as a cover-up over [[swimwear]]. The wrap is often made of a thin, light fabric, often [[rayon]], and may feature decorative fringing on both sides. They may have ties, which are long thin straps of fabric which the wearer can tie together to prevent the wrap from falling down. These wraps are mostly worn by women as beach cover ups and do not usually resemble traditional Asian or African sarongs in size, pattern or design. Western men who wear male sarongs are influenced by the Scottish kilt or lava-lava within the Polynesian or Samoan culture. Typically sarongs are worn by men when they are at home or at the beach or as a cover up on a nude beach or by the pool or on a cruise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://1worldsarongs.blogspot.co.id/2014/04/sarongs-for-men.html|title=The Sarong Source|last=|first=|date=2014-04-03|website=1 World Sarongs Blog|publisher=www.1worldsarongs.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Securing==
Numerous tying methods exist to hold a sarong to the wearer's body.  In some cases, these techniques customarily differ according to the sex of wearer.  If a sarong has ties, they may be used to hold it in place. Sarong ties give the wearer a little extra hold and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.1worldsarongs.com/sartiesusetc.html|title=1 World Sarongs|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If no ties exist, a pin may be used, the fabric may be tightly tucked under itself in layers, the corners of the main sheet may be around the body and knotted, or a [[belt (clothing)|belt]] may be used to hold the sarong in place.

The basic garment known in English most often as a "sarong", sewn or unsewn, has analogs in many regions, where it shows variations in style and is known by different names.

*[[Africa]]
**In [[East Africa]], it is called either a [[Kanga (African garment)|kanga]] (worn by African women), or a [[kikoy]], traditionally worn by men and used with much simpler designs, however, it is used more frequently in high fashion. Kangas are brightly coloured lengths of [[cotton]] that incorporate elaborate and artistic designs and usually include the printing of a Swahili proverb along the hem.
**In [[Madagascar]] it is called a [[Lamba (garment)|lamba]].
**In [[Malawi]] it is called a [[chitenje]].
**In [[Somalia]] it is called a Macawis
**In [[Mauritius]] they are called pareos.
**In [[Mozambique]] it is called a [[capulana]].
**In [[South Africa]] it is called a [[kanga (African garment)|kikoi]] and commonly used as a furniture throw or for going to the beach.
**In [[Zambia]] they are known as chitenge.

*[[Brazil]]
** [[Kanga (African garment)|"Kangas"]] or "cangas" are used in Brazil as swimwear by women. Those are readily available at beaches and littoral cities, but are also found in shops in the countryside for swimming in pools or rivers.

*[[Middle East]]
**In [[Saudi Arabia]], it is called "Fouta" ([[Arabic]]: فوطه).
**In [[Yemen]], it is called either "Fouta" ([[Arabic]]: فوطه) or "Meouaz" ([[Arabic]]: معوز).

*[[South Asia]]
** In [[South India]] it is called a [[lungi]].  It is most often sewn into a large cylindrical shape, so there is no slit when the phanek or lungi is tied.
** In eastern India and [[Bangladesh]] it is known as a [[lungi]].
** In [[Northeastern India]] traditional clothing are the [[Phanek]] in Manipur and [[Mekhela]] in Assam which are very similar to the traditional attires of other South-East Asian nations and are completely different from South Asia. 
**In South India it is called Veetti in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], pancha in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], panche in [[Kannada]], and [[Mundu]] in [[Malayalam]].
** In the [[Maldives]], and Indian state of [[Kerala]], it is known as a [[mundu]], feyli&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=549883&amp;partid=1&amp;output=Terms%2f!!%2fOR%2f!!%2f20585%2f!%2f%2f!%2fsarong%2f!%2f%2f!!%2f%2f!!!%2f&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database%2fadvanced_search.aspx&amp;currentPage=1&amp;numpages=10 Sarong], The British Museum&lt;/ref&gt; or neriyathu.

==In the media==
The American public is most familiar with the sarong for the dozens of [[film]]s set in the South Seas, most of them romantic dramas made in the 1930s and 1940s. [[Dorothy Lamour]] is by far the actress most linked with the garment, which was designed by [[Edith Head]].  Lamour starred in multiple films of this genre, starting with ''[[The Hurricane (1937 film)|The Hurricane]]'' in 1937.  In fact, Lamour was nicknamed "The Sarong Girl" by the press and even wore a sarong on occasion in more traditional films.  Among the other actresses to don the sarong for film roles are [[Maria Montez]], [[Gilda Gray]], [[Myrna Loy]], [[Gene Tierney]], [[Frances Farmer]] and [[Movita]].  Male stars who wore the manly sarongs on film include [[Jon Hall (actor)|Jon Hall]], [[Ray Milland]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]], [[Sabu Dastagir]] and [[Ralph Fiennes]] in ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]''. The sarong was also worn by Pierce Brosnan in ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1999). The 2005 documentary film ''Soldiers in Sarong'', directed by Lokendra Arambam, depicts the women's resistance movement in [[Manipur|Manipur, North-East India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cultureunplugged.com/play/1156/Soldiers-in-Sarong |title=Soldiers in Sarong directed by Lokendra Arambam |work=Cultureunplugged.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Singapore, the term ''[[Sarong Party Girl]]'' refers to a local single Singaporean woman especially of Chinese ethnicity who favour socializing and having relationships with expatriate Caucasian men rather than the local ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9292">A '''shtick''' ({{lang-yi|'''שטיק'''}}, the closely related German word ''Stück'' sounds similar, yet it is not used in the same way as the English "thing") is a comic theme or [[gimmick]] derived from the [[Yiddish]] word ''shtik'' (שטיק), meaning "piece" (in stand-up comedy a near equivalent term is a "bit"). The English word for "piece" or "thing" is sometimes used in a similar context. Another variant is "bits of business" or just "bits". ''Shtick'' may refer to an adopted persona, usually for comedy performances, that is maintained consistently (though not necessarily exclusively) across the performer's career. In this usage, the recurring personalities adopted by Laurel and Hardy through all of their many comedy films (although they often played characters with different names and occupations) would qualify as their shtick. A comedian might maintain several different shticks of this sort, particularly if appearing in a variety show encouraging development of multiple characters, such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. 

In common usage, the word ''shtick'' has also come to mean any talent, style, habit, or other eccentricity for which a person is particularly well-known, even if not intended for comedic purposes. For example, a person who is known locally for an ability to eat dozens of hot dogs quickly might say that it was his shtick. Among [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], "shtick" can also refer to [[Jewish wedding#Special dances|wedding shtick]], in which wedding guests entertain the bride and groom through dancing, costumes, juggling, and silliness.

Because of its roots in show business, ''shtick'' has taken on connotation of a contrived and often used act. For this reason, journalists and commentators often apply the word disparagingly to stock replies from politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, Michael D. ''[http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/07/the_white_stripes_and_their_on.html  The White Stripes and Their One-Note Shtick]'', ''[http://nymag.com/  New York Magazine]'', July 18, 2007. Retrieved January 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
*[[Jack Benny]]'s character on his radio program was notoriously both stingy and a bad violin player, as well as being perpetually 39 years old.  In real life, Benny was known as a competent [[violin]]ist and lavish tipper, and kept celebrating his 39th birthday each year publicly because "there's nothing funny about 40".
*Three of the [[Marx Brothers]], [[Groucho Marx|Groucho]], [[Chico Marx|Chico]] and [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]], had well-honed shticks by the time they started making movies.
**Groucho, with his stooped walk, greasepaint moustache, [[lascivious]] eyebrow raising, and his cigar;
**Chico, with his fake [[Italian language|Italian]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], his "shooting the keys" style of piano playing, and borderline moronic behavior; and
**Harpo, with his [[Mime artist|pantomime]] routines, the [[Magic satchel#In films|seemingly bottomless pockets]] of his [[trench coat]], and his ability to play the [[harp]].
** The fourth performing brother, [[Zeppo Marx|Zeppo]], never developed a shtick and was a straight man in their movies — though some have argued that blandness and "normality" was indeed his shtick.
*[[W.C. Fields]] nurtured a character that was not far from himself in real life, being misanthropic, misogynistic, and a hard drinker, as well as the unique bellow of his voice and his famous bulbous nose.
*Many of the performers over the course of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s long broadcast history have developed shticks that were popular enough to be developed into feature films. The earliest of these was ''[[The Blues Brothers]]'', the dark-suited alter egos of [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]], which spawned two movies and several actual blues albums. Of the movies that followed in later years, some met with similar success (such as [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]' ''[[Wayne's World]]''), while others are regarded as critical and commercial disasters ([[Julia Sweeney]]'s ''[[It's Pat]]''!).
*[[Henny Youngman]]'s standard line "Take my wife&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; please!" was part of his schtick. It consisted of several [[One-liner joke|one-liners]] delivered in rapid-fire sequence.
*[[Johnny Carson]]'s many shticks include his role as "[[Carnac the Magnificent]]", an [[India]]n [[fortune teller]] who could divine answers to questions sealed in envelopes and "kept in a [[Hermetic seal|hermetically sealed]] [[mayonnaise]] jar on the front porch of [[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]] since noon today". His signature imaginary golf swing at the end of his [[monologue]] would also qualify.
*[[Chris Berman]]'s shtick in his [[ESPN]] commentary was his tendency to give additional [[nickname]]s to players based on their last names (often intended as [[pun]]s or [[popular culture|pop culture]] references). Berman was also known to often say a football player "could&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; go&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; all&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; way" on long [[touchdown]] plays (parodying [[Howard Cosell]]'s delivery).
*Comedian [[George Carlin]] created a famously banned shtick, "[[Filthy Words]]", a/k/a "Seven dirty words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/filthywords.html |title=George Carlin, Filthy Words |website=Exploring Constitutional Conflicts |quote=The following is a verbatim transcript of "Filthy Words" (the George Carlin monologue at issue in the Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation) prepared by the Federal Communications Commission... |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Andrew Dice Clay]]'s shtick in his comedy routines is his crude, [[misogynist]] themed humor, and sometimes vulgar reinterpretations of [[nursery rhymes]].
*[[Rodney Dangerfield]]'s shtick was centered around his famous [[catchphrase]], "I don't get no respect," accompanied by his characteristic facial gesture and yanking or straightening his scarlet necktie.
*[[Stephen Colbert]] has referred to [[Stephen Colbert (character)|his character]] as a shtick.
*[[Andy Kaufman]] was a particularly rigorous practitioner of shtick. Kaufman almost never appeared in public, other than as one of his shtick characters, such as "Foreign Man" or [[Tony Clifton]]. When he did appear as himself, he still acted out some shtick routine, with one notable example being a long-running [[professional wrestling]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#F|feud]] with [[Jerry Lawler]].
*[[The Rubberbandits]] are Irish comedians who wear plastic bags over their faces as shtick.
*[[Yakov Smirnoff]]'s shtick, at the height of his career, involved comparisons between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], punctuated by the catchprase "What a country!".
*[[Lewis Black]]'s shtick is the crescendo of rage upon which his routines are built; another is bewailing the rise in his blood pressure due to the presumed strain of these outbursts.
*[[Sam Kinison]]'s shtick was his increasingly emotional, high-stress vocal delivery, often leading to actual shouting or screaming, to the point where his voice became hoarse.
*[[Bob Newhart]]'s shtick is his long phone calls with imaginary or historical persons. Hearing only Newhart's [[deadpan]] comments, the audience is left to infer what the other person is saying.&lt;ref name=NewhartNYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Zinoman |first=Jason |title=No Real Hurry to Tell the Joke: Bob Newhart, Master of the One-Sided Conversation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/arts/television/bob-newhart-master-of-the-one-sided-conversation.html |website=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=30 October 2014 |date=May 26, 2014 |quote=Mr. Newhart became famous through stand-up routines that were one-sided telephone conversations in which his comic partner was neither seen nor heard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*All original members of [[The Wiggles]] were known for having schticks. [[Jeff Fatt]]'s was [[narcolepsy|falling asleep at odd times]], leading the other Wiggles and the audience to call out the [[catchphrase]] "[[Wake up Jeff|Wake Up Jeff!]]", [[Anthony Field]]'s was eating too much food, [[Greg Page (musician)|Greg Page]]'s was doing [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] tricks, and [[Murray Cook]]'s was an obsession with playing the [[guitar]].
*[[Penn and Teller]]'s shtick focuses mainly on which part of the duo does the talking; Penn provides the only on-stage narration and is the only public voice of the act, whereas Teller never speaks on stage or on camera. In on-camera interviews, Teller remains in shadow, and in rare circumstances when Teller speaks on-stage, his face is obscured.
*[[Gilbert Gottfried]]'s stage persona, with his perpetually high-pitched squeaky voice and pinched face, is a shtick that has been maintained through almost all of his public appearances and television and film roles.
*[[Larry the Cable Guy]]'s stage persona, developed during his days as a member of a morning radio zoo crew, is considered a shtick. Despite his public appearances as a hillbilly with a deep Southern accent, propensity for wearing sleeveless flannel shirts and his signature "Git-R-Done!" catchphrase, the comedian, whose real name is Daniel Whitney, is a native of Nebraska.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4424">A '''spec script''', also known as a '''speculative screenplay''', is a non-commissioned and unsolicited [[screenplay]]. It is usually written by a [[screenwriter]] who hopes to have the script [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] and eventually purchased by a [[Film producer|producer]], [[Filmmaking|production]] company, or [[Movie studio|studio]].

Spec scripts which have gone on to win [[Academy Awards]] include ''[[Thelma &amp; Louise]]'' (sold by [[Callie Khouri]] to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] for US$500,000 in 1990), ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' (sold by [[Matt Damon]] and [[Ben Affleck]] to [[Miramax|Miramax Films]] for US$675,000 in 1994) and ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' (sold by [[Alan Ball (screenwriter)|Alan Ball]] to [[DreamWorks|DreamWorks SKG]] for US$250,000 in 1998).&lt;ref name="Vanityfair"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/03/will-spec-script-screenwriters-rise-again |work= [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |title= When The Spec Script Was King |first= Margaret |last= Heidenry |date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1933, [[Preston Sturges]] is believed to have sold the first spec script in Hollywood history. Fox bought ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]'' for US$17,500 plus back-end revenue. The movie did poorly at the box office.&lt;ref name="Vanityfair"/&gt; However, in 2014 the film was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].

Spec scripts have not always held as much cachet in the business as they do now. [[Ernest Lehman]] describes how his original script for ''[[North by Northwest]]'' was unusual at that point in his career:
{{quote|Originals were not smiled upon in those days, believe it or not. There was ''very'' little interest in originals in those days. [...] Studios, distributors wanted the assurance of someone else having thought a property worth publishing [...] In those days, if you went to a party in the Hollywood community and somebody would ask, "What are you working on, Ernie?" and you replied, "I'm doing an original now," the response would be "Oh." [...] Like they were a little embarrassed [...] If you were working on something that you were going to create all by yourself, they'd secretly think, "He's in bad shape. Working on an original." That definitely was the climate at one time in this town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= John |last= Brady |title= The Craft of the Screenwriter| year= 1981 |page= 204}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the late 1960s, [[William Goldman]] sold his spec script ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' to [[Warner Bros.]] for US$400,000 in a studio bidding war. The script went on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Academy Award for Best Screenplay]]. This event precipitated a rise in screenwriters writing on spec.&lt;ref name="Vanityfair"/&gt;

==Attracting producers==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2007}}
If the writer of a spec script has an agent, the agent will identify a number of prospective buyers who may range from small independent producers to executives working in the major studios, and attempt to build up 'heat' under the script. The script may be sent out simultaneously to all the prospective buyers in the hope of attracting a bidding war.

If the script sells, the writer may receive a payment of anything from a few tens of thousands of dollars to several million. If not, the script is sometimes dead in the water because it is now in the databases of the studios and development executives, and has been marked as having been 'passed' on.

If a spec script is not picked up, but the script is considered good, the screenwriter may be offered a writing assignment. Spec scripts are often written by unknown screenwriters looking to prove their storytelling ability and make a name for themselves in the film industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4203">{{For|the effects of a stall of the airfoil within the compressor of a jet engine|Compressor stall}}

A '''stall''' is the slowing or stopping of a process and in the case of an [[engine]] refers to a sudden stopping of the engine turning,{{Sfn|Schultz|1979|pp=128-130}} usually brought about accidentally.

It is commonly applied to the phenomenon whereby an [[engine]] abruptly ceases operating and stops turning. It might be due to not getting enough [[air]], [[energy]], [[fuel]], or [[electric spark]], fuel starvation, a [[mechanical failure]], or in response to a sudden increase in engine load.{{Sfn|Schultz|1979|pp=128-130}}{{Sfn|Hillier|1990|p=223}} This increase in engine load is common in vehicles with a [[manual transmission]] when the [[clutch]] is released too suddenly.{{Sfn|Wardlaw|2014}}

The ways in which a car can stall is usually down to the driver, especially on manual transmission. For instance if a driver takes their foot off the clutch too quickly while stationary then the car will stall; taking the foot off the clutch slowly will stop this from happening. Stalling also happens when the driver forgets to depress the clutch and/or change to neutral while coming to a stop.{{Sfn|Wardlaw|2014}} Stalling can be dangerous, especially in heavy traffic.{{Sfn|Schultz|1979|pp=128-130}}

A car fitted with an [[automatic transmission]] could also have its engine stalled when the vehicle is travelling in the opposite direction to the selected gear.{{Sfn|Roth|2009}} For example, if the selector is in the 'D' position and the car is moving backwards, (on a steep enough hill to overcome the torque from the [[torque converter]]) the engine will stall, due to the fact that the engine is forced to turn in the opposite direction to what it is actually doing. This is because, hypothetically, if the car is rolling backward fast enough, the force from the rotating wheels will be transmitted backward through the transmission and act as a sudden load on the engine.

[[Fuel_injection#Electronic_injection|Digital electronics fuel injection]] and [[Engine control unit|ECU]] [[ignition system]]s have greatly reduced stalling in modern [[engine]]s.{{Sfn|Hatch|2012|p=529}}

[[Image:telescreen.png|thumb|[[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]]'s face looms on giant telescreens in Victory Square in one of several scenes of [[Michael Radford]]'s [[Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984 film)|1984 film adaptation]] of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.]]

'''Telescreens''' are devices that operate as both [[televisions]], [[Closed-circuit television|security cameras]] and [[microphone]]s. They are featured in [[George Orwell]]'s dystopian novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' as well as all film adaptations of the novel. In the novel and its adaptations, telescreens are used by the ruling [[Inner Party|Party]] in the [[totalitarian]] fictional State of [[Oceania (1984)|Oceania]] to keep its subjects under constant surveillance, thus eliminating the chance of secret conspiracies against Oceania.

All members of the [[Inner Party]] (''[[nomenklatura]]'') and [[Outer Party]] (middle-class) have telescreens in their homes, but the [[proles]] (lower-class) are not typically monitored as they are unimportant to the Party. As later explained in [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]'s book of which Smith reads some excerpts, the Party does not feel threatened by the Proles, assuming that they would never rebel on their own, and therefore does not find a need to monitor their daily lives. 

The character [[O'Brien (book character)|O'Brien]] claims that he, as a member of the Inner Party, can turn off his telescreen (although etiquette dictates only for half an hour at a time). While the programmes could no longer be seen or heard, the screen still functioned as a surveillance device, as after Winston is taken into the [[Ministry of Love]], the audio of his meeting with O'Brien with the telescreen "off" is played back to Winston. 

The screens are monitored by the [[Thought Police]]. However, it is not clear how many screens are monitored at once, or what the precise criteria (if any) for monitoring a given screen are (although it is seen that during an exercise programme that Winston takes part in every morning, the instructor can see him, meaning telescreens are possibly an early variant of [[videophone]]s). Telescreen cameras do not have [[night vision]] technology, thus, they cannot monitor in the dark. This is compensated by the fact that their microphones are incredibly sensitive, and they are said to pick up a heartbeat. As Winston describes, "... even a back can be revealing ..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being surveillance devices, telescreens are also televisions (hence the name). It broadcasts [[propaganda]] about Oceania's military victories, economic production figures, spirited renditions of the [[national anthem]] to heighten [[patriotism]], and [[Two Minutes Hate]], which is a two-minute film of [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]'s wishes for [[freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of the press|press]], which the citizens have been trained to disagree with through [[doublethink]]. Many of the telescreen programmes are transmitted in [[Newspeak]].

==Other uses==
The word "telescreen" also appears in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Space Cadet]]'',{{cn|date=November 2013}} written at the same time as Orwell's book, where it simply refers to an instrument similar to a large [[television]], but with none of Orwell's sinister connotations.

[[File:Coq-gaulois-dore.JPG|right|335px]]
"'''The Taill of the Cok and the Jasp'''" is a [[Middle Scots]] version of [[Aesop]]'s [[Aesop's Fables|Fable]] ''[[The Cock and the Jewel]]'' by the 15th-century [[Scotland|Scottish]] poet [[Robert Henryson]]. It is the first in Henryson's collection known as the ''[[Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian]]''. ''The Cok and the Jasp'' is framed by a [[Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian#Prolog and Fabill 1|prologue]] and a ''moralitas'', and as the first poem in the collection it operates on a number of levels, and in all its parts, to introduce the larger cycle.

==Sources==
[[File:Tacuin Seigle37.jpg|right|thumb|Grain gathering in the 14th century]]
Although the Aesopian tale of ''[[The Cock and the Jewel]]'', which Henryson re-tells, is typically simple, it is one of the most ambiguous in the fable canon. It presents what is, in effect, a [[riddle]] on relative values with almost the force of a [[kōan]]. One modern translation of the fable, in its most cogent form, runs thus:

{{Quotation|A Cock, scratching the ground for something to eat, turned up a Jewel that had by chance been dropped there. "Ho!" said he, "a fine thing you are, no doubt, and, had your owner found you, great would his joy have been. But for me ! give me a single grain of corn before all the jewels in the world."

:''[[Aesop's Fables]]'', translated by V.S. Vernon Jones (1912)}}

The standard medieval interpretation of the fable, however (which Henryson follows) came down firmly against the cockerel on the grounds that the jewel represents wisdom rather than mere wealth or allure. This interpretation is expressed in the ''[[Phaedrus (fabulist)#Verse Romulus|verse Romulus]]'', the standard fable text across Europe in that era, written in the [[lingua franca]], Latin.

Henryson tacitly acknowledges this "source" in his own expanded version by claiming to be making a "translatioun" from the Latin and directly quoting some of its lines.&lt;ref&gt;Henryson directly quotes the second line of the prologue to the ''verse Romulus'', "Dulcius arrident seria picta iocis," in his own ''prolog'' — a clear and deliberate identifier of his ''[[auctor]]''. See [[Edward Wheatley]], ''Mastering Aesop: Medieval Education, Chaucer and his Followers'', University Press of Florida, 2000. p.152.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Romulus'' was a standard classroom text used in primary education to teach Latin. Since ''The Cock and the Jewel'' (''[[The Cock and the Jewel|De Gallo et Jaspide]]'') was the first fable in this standard collection, it was, ''de facto,'' a universally familiar text in literary consciousness throughout Europe.

==Prologue==
There is little doubt that the succinct ''prolog'' which leads into the ''Cok and the Jasp'' is intended to introduce a general collection of Fabillis, not solely the Fabill of the ''Cok and the Jasp''.&lt;ref&gt;The textual witnesses which place Henryson's ''Cok and the Jasp'' at the head of the sequence (as also occurs in the ''verse Romulus'') include the [[Charteris]] and [[Bassandyne]] editions of 1570 and 1571 respectively. Earlier manuscript witnesses, being more fragmented, do not universally make this clear. See [[John MacQueen]], ''Complete and Full with Numbers: The Narrative Poetry of Robert Henryson.'' Scottish Cultural Review of Language and Literature, Vol. 5. Rodopi. Amsterdam/New York. 2006. p.283.&lt;/ref&gt; It opens with a [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|defense of poetry]] (expanded from the ''verse Romulus''), presents an [[apologia]] for making the ''[[translation|translatioun]]'', establishes the [[First-person narrative|first person]] [[narrator]], summarises Aesop's work and provides a bridging passage into the ''First Fabill''.

[[File:Boricha.jpg|250px|left]]

The first four stanzas develop a general argument that [[fiction]], even though it may be ''[[deception|feinyeit]]'' by nature, can have a sound moral purpose at heart, and that stories which are ''[[aesthetics|pleisand]]'' (line 4) or ''[[humour|merie]]'' (line 20) are better suited to convey wisdom than dry [[scholasticism|scholastic]] writing. Henryson develops his meaning using three images; [[cereal|cereal cultivation]] (stanza 2), the ''[[nutshell|nuttis schell]]'' (stanza 3) and the [[bowstring]] (stanza 4).

In stanza [[5 (number)|5]] (the middle stanza of the prolog) the narrator identifies and directly addresses his audience for the first time as ''my [[Medieval university|maisteris]]'', or in other words, his own [[Academic degree|university educated]] peers. The writer, in effect, is figuring himself in the role of student before his teachers (his readers). The stanza also makes cryptic reference to an unnamed commissioning [[patron]] for the poem who may or may not have existed.&lt;ref&gt;The poem (says the narrator) was not written on his own ''[[vanity|vane]]'' presumptioun, but:
:''...be requeist and precept of ane lord''
:''Of quhome the name it neidis not record.''
:  (M.F. lines 34-5)
Most critics express doubt there was any such actual patron, but the possibility cannot strictly be ruled out.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[recusatio|humility topos]] continues into the next stanza where the narrator pretends to have no understanding of [[eloquence]] and an ability only to write in ''[[Plain language|rude]]'' and ''[[Vernacular|hamelie]]'' language, a self-deferential reference to his choice to create poetry in [[Middle Scots|Scots]] rather than [[Medieval Latin|Latin]]. He concludes by inviting his readers to correct any mistakes they may find.

A brief [[Critical précis|precis]] of Aesop's fable literature then follows in the next three stanzas with a stark view of its purposes and some comments on how [[ethology|animal behaviour]] and [[human nature]] compare.&lt;ref&gt;For instance: 
:''Na mervell is ane man be lyke ane beist''
:''Quhilk lufis [[Wiktionary:always|ay]] carnal and foull delyte;''
:''That schame can not him renye nor arreist...''
:  (M.F. lines 50-53)&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth stanza ends with a swift bridging passage into the first Fabill.

==Fable==
[[File:Gallo de corral (view large).jpg|220px|right]]
Of all the thirteen ''taillis'', the ''Cok and the Jasp'' most pretends to be like the static and conventional re-tellings more usual in fable genre. Henryson's innovation and development from his sources chiefly involve presenting an unusually well-rounded, imaginatively realised figure of the [[cockerel|cok]] in a specific and concretely drawn setting. He establishes explicit reasons for the loss of the [[gemstone|jasp]] and sets the location for its discovery as a [[Landfill|midden]]. He also expands the cockerel's arguments and ultimate reasons for the rejection of the jasp as a carefully orchestrated passage of fully fleshed [[oration]] which nonetheless continues to sound as if it is being delivered in the voice of a cockerel. But since this is not so much a story — more a strongly drawn [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]] — the fabill does not yet fully live up to the requirements for fully effective storytelling argued for in the prolog. This will come in the subsequent fabillis, and so, in a sense, the First Fabill partly acts to defer reader's expectations.

The cok addresses the stone directly, acknowledges its worth, recognises it has been misplaced and argues, realistically enough, that to him it is of no practical use. The jasp, he says, is an object that belongs more properly to a ''[[lord]] or [[monarchy|king]]'' (line 81), while he is content simply to satisfy his humble wants in ''[[chaff|draf]]'', ''[[maize|corn]]'', ''[[worm]]is'' and ''[[snail]]lis'' — his daily ''[[Bread|meit]]''. The rhetorical climax comes in the seventh stanza of the fabill in which the ''cok'', rising on a number of [[rhetorical question]]s, finishes with an almost fantastical exortation for the stone to [[levitate]] and transport itself back to some more royal place:

:''Quhar suld thow mak thy habitatioun?''
:''Quhar suld thow duell bot in ane [[Castle#Construction|royall tour]]?''
:''Quhar suld thow sit bot on ane [[Honours of Scotland|kingis croun]],''
:''Exaltit in worschip and in grit honour?''
:''Rise gentill jasp, of all [[Rock (geology)|stanis]] the [[flower|flour]]''
:''Out of this midding, and pas quhar thow suld be;''
:''Thow [[Wiktionary:gain|ganis]] not for me, nor I for [[Wiktionary:thee|the]].''
(M.F. lines 106-112)

And the cock, leaving the jasp, exits the poem to ''[[scavenge|seek his meit]]'' (line 114).

==Moralitas==
[[File:Chludov saint peter.jpg|120px|left|thumb|[[St Peter]] and the Cock.]]

The poet immediately follows the ''taill'' with a [[moral]]itas. This was a common device in medieval and renaissance fable literature, and its use here establishes the convention that Henryson will employ consistently through all thirteen of the ''Morall Fabillis''.

In this case, however, before the Moralitas properly begins, stanza 18 (the ninth stanza of the fabill) as a footnote to the ''taill'', intercedes with a compressed account of the qualities of the jasp, including its [[Magic (paranormal)|protective properties]], which almost instantly casts doubt on the wisdom of the cock's decision. For example, lines 125-6:

:Quha hes this stane sall have gude [[luck|hap]] to [[Prosperity|speid]],
:Of fyre nor water him neidis not to [[fear|dreid]].

In a sense, stanza 18 presents a new riddle and, to be answered, requires the cock's argument to be turned.

The Moralitas proper is usually given to begin after stanza 18 in most textual witnesses except [[George Bannatyne|Bannatyne]].&lt;ref&gt;See the Charles Elliot edition of Robert Henryson's poems, Oxford Clarendon Press, reprint 1978. (Note to ''Morall Fabillis'', line 120). Page 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Its five stanzas come down explicitly against the cock and so, by implication, present a [[conceit]] of [[Deductive closure|closure]] on Aesop's more open and enigmatic original. The narrator minces no words in expressing how serious the cockerel's error has been in rejecting the stone because, he says, the jasp represents ''[[Science in the Middle Ages|science]]'', in the sense of [[wisdom]], which he defines in terms that bring it close in meaning to concepts like ''[[dharma]]''. In the final stanza he laments mankind's general failure to respect and comprehend these values:

:Bot now, allace, this jasp is [[:wikt:loss|tynt]] and hid;
:We seik it nocht, nor [[Wiktionary:strive|preis]] it for to find…

He closes, with pretended indifference, by advising the reader, if he so wishes, to go seek the jasp where it lies.&lt;ref&gt;Henryson closes the fabill moralitas: "Of this mater to speik it wer bot wind;/Thairfore I [[Wiktionary:cease|ceis]] and will na forther say:/Ga seek the jasp, quha will, for thair it lay. (M.F. lines 159-61.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:Blason Jausiers.svg|120px|right|thumb|Heraldic cockerel with grain]]
Henryson's expansion of Aesop's fable makes its inferences concrete, introduces complexity and raises a large number of themes in a very short space. In relation to other known fable literature in Europe up to that time, the ''[[Loading (disambiguation)|loading]]'' is extremely rich.

Even though the moralitas comes down sincerely and emphatically on the side of the rejected stone, nevertheless, the cockerel has raised questions that are not necessarily easily resolved. The subsequent poems will appear to further intensify many of those [[doubt]]s and [[dichotomies]] rather than resolving them. Therefore, the riddling aspect to the [[Aesop]]ian original is, in some regards, not ultimately overturned and is arguably maintained as part of the fabric of the poem.

Among the specific issues touched on or implied in Henryson's expansion are questions of [[fiction]] and [[truth]], [[appetite]], self-interest, [[Moral responsibility|fecklessness]], [[materialism]], [[duty]], [[wisdom]], [[hierarchy]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[education]], [[social order]], [[government]], the nature of [[aristocracy]], the nature of [[Royal family|royalty]] and many others. There is also the question of who the cockerel ultimately represents and whether, in some sense, Henryson's poem itself is ultimately the [[jasper|jasp]] which the reader has encountered "in the midden" to take or leave as he or she wishes.

==Opening lines==
It is worth noting that the opening of Henryson's Prolog to the ''Morall Fabillis'' echoes the opening lines of [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]]'s ''Brus''. It is therefore a variation on the theme of the relation between truth and report in literature. For comparison, the first ten lines, of ''[[The Brus]]'', composed in the 1370s, run:

:''Storyss to [[reading (process)|rede]] ar delitibill''
:''Suppos that thai be nocht but fabill,''
:''Than suld storys that [[Wikt:reliable|suthfast]] wer''
:''And thai war said on gud maner''
:''Have doubill plesance in heryng.''
:''the first plesance is the [[recitation|carpyng]],''
:''And the tother the suthfastnes''
:''That shawys the thing rycht as it wes,''
:''And suth thyngis that ar [[agreeable|likand]]''
:''Till mannys heryng ar plesand.''
([[John Barbour (poet)|Barbour]], ''The Brus'', lines 1-10)

Henryson's first stanza, written just over a century later, uses a number of the same (or similar) terms, but, in shorter space, generates a slightly less sanguine impression of the relation between narrative, audience and subject. The differences are subtle, but distinct:

:''Thocht feinyit fabillis of [[classics|ald poetre]]''
:''Be not al grunded upon truth, yit [[Wiktionary:then|than]]''
:''Thair polite termes of sweit rhetore''
:''Richt plesand ar unto the eir of man;''
:''And [[Wiktionary:also|als]] the caus that thay first began''
:''Wes to [[critique|repreif]] the haill [[wrongdoing|misleving]]
:''Off man be [[representation (arts)|figure]] of ane uther thing.''
(Henryson, ''Morall Fabillis'', lines 1-7)

==Numbers==
The first fabill, in all its three parts, occupies 23 stanzas, distributed 9—9—5. 
*Prolog: 9 stanzas
*Fabill: 9 stanzas, including stanza 18 on the properties of the jasp (see above).
*Moralitas: 5 stanzas

Because of the ambiguity of the status of stanza 18 (as in a sense a second "mini" moralitas) the count could be interpreted as 
* 9—8—6,
or even perhaps, 
* 9—8—1—5.

The '''Three Rural Issues''', or '''San Nong''' ({{zh|s=三农|t=三農|p=sān nóng}}), refers to three issues relating to rural development in [[People's Republic of China|mainland China]].  Specifically, these issues are [[agriculture]], [[rural|rural area]]s and [[farmer]]s.  The Three Rural Issues were highlighted by [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Wen Jiabao]] as areas of rural development in China that need work.

At the [[2006 National People's Congress]], the Three Rural Issues were especially emphasized throughout Wen Jiabao's speech on the workings of the government in 2005 and the direction of the government for the year 2006. In the rural areas, agricultural reforms had made the peasants better-off until the 1990s when land supply became insufficient and the cost of the means of production was soaring. As a result, the income of the peasants was greatly reduced. Today, the "three problem of peasantry, rural areas and agriculture" are still a major concern of the government.

==Content==

===Issue of Agriculture===
In general, the issue is how to industrialize agriculture in China. It includes (1) increasing the marketization level of agricultural production and operation, and stabilizing the prices of agricultural products; (2) changing the situation of smallholder economic agriculture, achieving economies of scale of agricultural production and operation; (3) guaranteeing the food security in China. 

===Issue of Rural Areas===
This is particularly reflected in the disparity of economic and cultural development between urban and rural areas. It is mainly caused by the dual segmentation based on the household registration system.

===Issue of Farmers===

It includes improving the income level of farmers, alleviating burdens of farmers, increasing the cultural qualities of farmers, and safeguarding the rights of farmers.

Not to be confused with migration of rural workers to Cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3803">The '''Tibetan and Himalayan Library''' ('''THL'''), formerly  the '''Tibetan and Himalayan Digital Library''' ('''THDL'''), is a multimedia guide and [[digital library]] hosted by the [[University of Virginia]] focused on the languages, history and geography of [[Tibet]] and the [[Himalayas]]. The THL has also designed a scholarly transcription for [[Standard Tibetan]] known as the [[THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription]].

==Overview==
THDL was established in 2000 in association with the [[University of Virginia]] Library and the [[Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities]], using the innovative [[Fedora Commons]] (Flexible Extensible Digital Object Repository Architecture) system.  Content includes publications, research resources, language learning materials, and a gazetteer.

THDL provides "an integrated environment for the digital publication of many diverse academic projects connected with Tibet and the Himalayan region". 
The structure of THDL consists of five overarching domains: Collections, Reference, Community, Tools, and Education.

Content of THDL is in English, [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Dzongkha]] and Chinese languages. Most content in the digital library is published under the THDL Public License For Digital Texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thdl.org/xml/showEssay.php?xml=/tools/THDLTextLicense.xml | title = THDL Public License for Digital Texts | publisher = THDL | accessdate = 2008-06-28 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080514092600/http://www.thdl.org/xml/showEssay.php?xml=%2Ftools%2FTHDLTextLicense.xml | archivedate = 2008-05-14 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is run by an international team of scholars from universities and private organizations around the world.

THDL hosts the [[Journal of the International Association of Tibetan Studies]] ([[JIATS]]), a freely available  online, [[peer-reviewed]] [[English language]] [[academic journal]] focusing on [[Tibetology|Tibetan studies]].

'''National Maritime Day''' is a [[United States]] holiday created to recognize the [[maritime industry]]. It is observed on [[May 22]], the date in 1819 that the American steamship ''Savannah'' set sail from [[Savannah, Georgia]] on the first ever transoceanic voyage under steam power. The holiday was created by the [[United States Congress]] on May 20, 1933.

On May 22, 2002, the Military Sealift Command observed National Maritime Day with a memorial service held in Washington, DC. Rear Adm. [[David L. Brewer III]], Commander, Military Sealift Command, and [[Gordon R. England]], Secretary of the Navy, tossed a wreath into the [[Anacostia River]] at the [[Washington Navy Yard]] in honor of fallen mariners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, National Maritime Day was celebrated with family picnics and boat tours at the [[Port of San Diego]], and with maritime career fairs in [[Seattle]] and the [[Port of Baltimore]], as well as with traditional memorial ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 2016, the Baltimore events were held at the ''[[NS Savannah]]'', Pier 13 of the [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]] Marine Terminal in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].  Boy Scout Explorer Post # 0438, a re-enactment group representing the First Baltimore Sharpshooters, a.k.a. Aisquith's Sharpshooters, was there in replica uniforms.  [[Battle of North Point]]  Many other groups, both businesses, non-profit groups, and educational groups were present.  Docked alongside the ''NS Savannah'' was the ''[[Golden Bear (ship)]]'', a training ship from California that was built nearby in [[Bethlehem Steel]] in [[Sparrows Point]], [[Maryland]], in 1986.

Education which aims to integrate awareness and understanding of distant peoples, environmental issues that impact all planetary species, and geopolitical systems as part of the curriculum is sometimes referred to as [[Global education|Global Education]].

==Online intercultural exchange==
Online intercultural exchange is an academic field of study connected to virtual exchange. It "involves instructionally mediated processes...for social interaction between internationally distributed partner classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Online-Intercultural-Exchange-Policy-Pedagogy-Practice/ODowd-Lewis/p/book/9781138932876|title=Online Intercultural Exchange: Policy, Pedagogy, Practice (Hardback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity has its roots in [[computer-assisted language learning]] (CALL) and [[computer-mediated communication]]. OIE is not restricted to language learning but happens across many educational disciplines where there is a desire to increase the internationalization of teaching and learning.

Developments in communication technologies and the relative ease with which forms of human communication can be technically afforded internationally since the existence of the internet resulted in language teaching experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.llas.ac.uk/resources/gpg/61|title=CALL (computer assisted language learning) {{!}} LLAS Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies|website=www.llas.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecting individuals, classrooms or groups of students to work together on tasks online involves attempting to arrive at shared understanding through "negotiation of meaning"&lt;ref&gt;Long, M.
