The '''1927 Bulgarian State Football Championship''' was not held, and thus there was no winner.

Following the bitter dispute from last season, that dragged on well into the spring of 1927, [[PFC Slavia Sofia|Slavia Sofia]], which won Sofiyska OSO ({{lang-bg|окръжна спортна област|lit=regional sports district}}), refused to enter the championship. Furthermore, only three other OSO winners were determined before the allotted deadline for participation in the State championship. Those were [[SC Vladislav Varna|Vladislav Varna]] from Varnenska OSO, [[Levski Ruse]] from Rusenska OSO and [[Levski Plovdiv]] from Plovdivska OSO. Because of this the championship for this season had to be cancelled.

The '''1938 FIFA World Cup''' was the third staging of the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], and was held in France from 4 to 19 June 1938. [[Italy national football team|Italy]] retained the championship by beating [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] 4–2 in the final. Italy's 1934 and 1938 teams became the only ones to have won two World Cups under the same coach, [[Vittorio Pozzo]].

== Host selection ==
{{main|FIFA World Cup hosts}}
France was chosen as host nation by [[FIFA]] in [[Berlin]] on 13 August 1936. France was chosen over Argentina and Germany in the first round of voting. The decision to hold a second consecutive tournament in Europe (after [[1934 FIFA World Cup|Italy in 1934]]) caused outrage in South America, where it was believed that the venue should alternate between the two continents. This was the last World Cup to be staged before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]].

== Qualification ==
{{main|1938 FIFA World Cup qualification}}
Because of anger over the decision to hold a second successive World Cup in Europe, neither [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] nor [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] entered the competition. [[Spain national football team|Spain]] meanwhile could not participate due to the ongoing [[Spanish Civil War]].

It was the first time that the hosts, [[France national football team|France]], and the title holders, [[Italy national football team|Italy]], qualified automatically. Title holders were given an automatic entry into the World Cup from 1938 until [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] (inclusive), after which it was abolished.

Of the 14 remaining places, eleven were allocated to Europe, two to the Americas, and one to Asia. As a result, only three non-European nations took part: Brazil, Cuba and the Dutch East Indies. This is the smallest ever number of teams from outside the host continent to compete at a FIFA World Cup.

[[Austria national football team|Austria]] qualified for the World Cup, but after qualification was complete, the [[Anschluss]] united Austria with Germany. Austria subsequently withdrew from the tournament, with some Austrian players joining the German squad, although not including Austrian star player [[Matthias Sindelar]], who refused to play for the unified team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashdown |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/22/world-cup-stunning-moments-austria-wunderteam |title=World Cup: 25 stunning moments … No11: Austria's Wunderteam|publisher=theguardian.com |date=22 April 2014 |accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] was the runner-up in Austria's qualification group, but was not invited to participate; instead Austria's place remained empty, and Sweden, which would have been Austria's initial opponent, progressed directly to the second-round by default.

This tournament saw the first, and {{as of|2018|06|alt=as of 2018}} the only, participation in a World Cup tournament from [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]] and the Dutch East Indies (now [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]]). It also saw the World Cup debuts of Poland and Norway. Romania would not qualify for another World Cup until [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]], Poland and the Netherlands would not reappear at a finals tournament until [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], and Norway would not qualify for another World Cup finals until 1994. A unified [[Germany national football team|Germany]] team would not appear again until [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], although [[Austria national football team|Austria]] returned in [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] and [[1954 FIFA World Cup#Semi-finals|won third place]].

===List of qualified teams===

The following 16 teams originally qualified for the final tournament. However, 15 teams participated after Austria's withdrawal due to the [[Anschluss]].

== Format ==
The knockout format from [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] was retained. If a match was tied after 90 minutes, then 30 minutes of [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] were played. If the score was still tied after extra time, the match would be replayed. This was the last World Cup tournament that used a straight knockout format.

== Summary ==
[[File:1938_FIFA_World_Cup.png|left|thumb|430px|Qualifying countries and their results]]

Germany, France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Cuba and Brazil were seeded for draw taking place in [[Paris]], on 5 March 1938. Sweden was given a bye due to Austria's withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_10e_fwcdraw-history_8842.pdf |title=History of the World Cup Final Draw |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five of the seven first round matches required extra time to break the deadlock; two games still went to a replay. In one replay, [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]] advanced to the next round at the expense of [[Romania national football team|Romania]]. In the other replay, [[Germany national football team|Germany]], which had led 1–0 in the first game against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], led 2–0 but eventually was beaten 2–4. This loss, which took place in front of a hostile, bottle-throwing crowd in Paris, was blamed by German coach [[Sepp Herberger]] on a defeatist attitude from the five Austrian players he had been forced to include; a German journalist later commented that "Germans and Austrians prefer to play against each other even when they're in the same team".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Tor!: The Story of German Football |first=Ulrich |last=Hesse-Lichtenberger |publisher=WSC Books |year=2003 |ISBN=095401345X |page=85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQfNyLM5svIC |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until they were knocked out in the first round in [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]], this was the only time Germany had failed to advance past the first round for 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jun/27/world-cup-2018-south-korea-v-germany-live|title=South Korea 2-0 Germany: World Cup 2018 – as it happened|first=Jacob|last=Steinberg|date=27 June 2018|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] advanced directly to the quarter-finals as a result of [[Austria national football team|Austria]]'s withdrawal, and they proceeded to beat Cuba 8–0. The hosts, [[France national football team|France]], were beaten by the holders, [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and Switzerland were seen off by [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] took [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] to extra time in a notoriously feisty match in [[Bordeaux]] before succumbing in a replay; the South Americans proved too strong for the depleted Czechoslovak side (both [[Oldřich Nejedlý]] and [[František Plánička]] had suffered broken bones in the first game) and won 2–1. This was the last ever match to be replayed in a World Cup.

Hungary destroyed Sweden in one of the semi-finals 5–1, while Italy and Brazil had the first of their many important World Cup clashes in the other. The Brazilians rested their star player [[Leônidas da Silva|Leônidas]] confident that they would qualify for the final, but the Italians won 2–1. Brazil topped Sweden 4–2 for third place.

Rumour has it, before the finals [[Benito Mussolini]] was to have sent a telegram to the team, saying "Vincere o morire!" (literally translated as "Win or die!"). This should not have been meant as a literal threat, but instead just an encouragement to win. However, no record remains of such a telegram, and World Cup player [[Pietro Rava]] said, when interviewed, "No, no, no, that's not true. He sent a telegram wishing us well, but no never 'win or die'."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Simon (1 April 2014): [https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/01/world-cup-moments-1938-italy-benito-mussolini "World Cup: 25 stunning moments … No8: Mussolini's blackshirts' 1938 win".] theguardian.com. Läst 22 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final itself took place at the [[Stade Olympique de Colombes]] in [[Paris]]. [[Vittorio Pozzo]]'s Italian side took the lead early, but Hungary equalised within two minutes. The Italians took the lead again shortly after, and by the end of the first half were leading the Hungarians 3–1. Hungary never really got back into the game. With the final score favouring the Italians 4–2, Italy became the first team to successfully defend the title and were once more crowned World Cup winners.

Because of [[World War II]], the World Cup would not be held for another 12 years, until [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]]. As a result, Italy were the reigning World Cup holders for a record 16 years, from 1934 to 1950. The Italian Vice-President of FIFA, [[Ottorino Barassi|Dr. Ottorino Barassi]], hid the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|trophy]] in a shoe-box under his bed throughout the Second World War and thus saved it from falling into the hands of occupying troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/h/rimet.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320063520/http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/h/rimet.html|archivedate=20 March 2007|title=Jules Rimet Cup|publisher=FIFAWorldCup.com|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Lyon FC has a three-part Mission:

* To be one of the best sports franchises in East Africa
* To help grow the sport of football in Tanzania
* To establish a soccer academy where talented players can be nurtured and trained.

African Lyon will only be positioned to achieve the second and third parts when we are successful with the first. We are taking this opportunity to launch our four-year strategic plan, Vision 2018. It is about connectivity, integration of teams and programs under a true club philosophy, sustainability for the future, and setting up strategic partnership with key international soccer franchises.

The 2018 timeline is driven by several external factors:

* '''''Preparation''''': increase in training hours
* '''''Momentum''''': expansion plans targeted at the 2016 season
* '''''Legacy Planning''''': strategic enrolment in national and international tournaments
* '''''Opportunity''''': Emerging new talent from all over East Africa

'''Status Report -Business with Seattle Sounders'''

As stated above, I write to update you on the various business ventures with Seattle. Ifelt it is important to provide you with a report from my perspective so you could blend your intervention into the reluctance of this matter.

# Paul Allen

Stephen Hall, the managing director of Vulcan Capital, Paul Allen's private investment firm, came to Dar es Salaam on November 9–11 to discuss various project proposals. The main project that he discussed was the potential for ‘micro-grid solar in village or per-urban environments’ in Tanzania. I set up several meetings on this. More about Vulcan Capital can be found here –&lt;nowiki&gt;http://capital.vulcan.com/AboutVulcanCapital/Index.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;

# Microsoft Bing( Paul Allen is a co-founder of Microsoft Bing)
# Portland Trailblazers(Owned by Paul Allen) The executives of this franchise NBA basketball team also made a presentation that was attended by Mr. Musa and I with TTB team. The presentation showed how we could extend the Seattle Agreement into Basketball so TTB can have visibility in Basketball, Football and Soccer.

The only remaining sport on that North West Pacific area is Baseball. Paul Allen owns the baseball field next to the Seattle Stadium.

# “The Price is Right” Seattle also made headways in generating interest from producers of a TV show entitled “The Price is Right”.

You can find out more of the show here –

&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.priceisright.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt;

# Evening Magazine Seattle has presented an opportunity for TTB to film a week of episodes for the show, ''Evening Magazine'', featuring Tanzania as a premier tourism destination and highlighting the Sounders partnership with Tanzania. The project was approved and Seattle invested 60,000 USD on it, this was to be done every year but due to lack of cooperation from TTB it happened only once.
# Micro grid Solar in Villages

From various successful meetings between Stephen Hall, the Managing director of Vulcan Capital, Paul Allen's private Investment team with officers from REA and Minister of Energy, they were able to Invest 6 Million USD, for more information on this please check :&lt;nowiki&gt;http://offgrid-electric.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt;)

# Tanzania Effect on the Super bowl As it turns out the partnership between TTB and Seattle came to be known as the ‘winning Magic’ by Seattle sounders and Hawks fans because since the advert appeared in late July 2012, Seattle's home teams became Undefeated at CenturyLink Field.
# Joe Ricketts in Tanzania From a good built relationship with Seattle Sounders I was able to connect Tanzania with WealthiestInvestor Joe Ricketts who introduced learning through tablets computers to Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar schools that honored country's commitment to using technology to magnify educational impacts. Please see; &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.joericketts.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''IMG COLLEGE'''

Organized a meeting between IMG College &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.imgcollege.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt; and Hon. Jakaya Kikwete, President of Tanzania. The aim is to promote Youths and providing free scholarship to athlete kids from Tanzania to United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="812">The '''Anton Cup''' is the [[Final (competition)|championship]] [[trophy]] of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[junior hockey]] league, [[J20 SuperElit]]. The trophy was donated by [[Anton Johansson]], [[chairman]] of the [[Swedish Ice Hockey Association]] between 1924–1948, in 1952, as an award for Sweden's top-ranking [[ice hockey]] club, decided by a national [[tournament]] without Swedish Championship status. From 1956-57, the tournament gained Swedish Championship status and district teams were allowed to participate. In 1961, the tournament was limited to only associations and clubs.

'''''Big Leaguer''''' is a 1953 American [[sports film|sports]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] starring [[Edward G. Robinson]] and was the first film directed by [[Robert Aldrich]].

Although this story is fiction, Robinson's character in it, [[Hans Lobert]], was an actual baseball player who played for five [[Major League Baseball]] teams and managed the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. Third-billed in the cast, [[Jeff Richards (baseball player/actor)|Jeff Richards]] was a professional ballplayer before he became an actor, and [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Carl Hubbell]] appears as himself.

"It was not a personal film of my status at the time," said Aldrich later. "I feel the film was good but not indicative of what I wanted to express in the motion picture medium."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=12|title=Robert Aldrich : interviews|first=Robert|last=Aldrich|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Mississippi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Plot ==

John "Hans" Lobert runs a training camp in Florida for baseball's [[New York Giants]]. Every year, he evaluates the 18 to- 22-year-old hopefuls to pick the best for a minor league contract. All have dreams and talent, but the elimination whittles them down to a lucky few who will get the $150-a-month contract.

Lobert's niece comes down from the home office in New York and finds herself attracted to one of the players, the tall, quiet Adam Polachuk.  Polachuk, the best prospect at third base, is trying to earn a spot on the team without his father knowing about it.  His father, who knows nothing about baseball, thinks Adam is attending school.  His father finds out about Adam's attempt to make the Giants just before the best of the recruits square off against the Brooklyn Dodgers' rookie squad.  

The elder Polachuk is persuaded by manager Lobert to let his son play in the game before taking him home.  Polachuk is the star of the game for the Giants both offensively and defensively as the Giants rally to win the game.

==Production==
The film was one of a series of low budget films made at MGM. According to Robert Aldrich, [[Louis B. Mayer]] "had wanted to put the sons of the guys who helped him form Metro into production work; and they had this thing called the sons of the pioneers... Three or four guys whose fathers had been helpful in first forming Metro."&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;

Mayer left MGM in 1951 but [[Dore Schary]] kept alive the idea, in part because of the success of a low budget unit at MGM which he ran in the early 1940s. In January 1952 he announced the formation of a new production unit under the supervision of [[Charles Schnee]]. It included several sons of executives who had helped establish MGM, Matthew Raft (son of [[Harry Rapf]]), Arthur Loew (son of [[Marcus Loew]]), and Sidney Franklin Jnr (son of [[Sidney Franklin (director)|Sidney Franklin]]). Other producers were Hayes Goetz, Henry Berman (brother of [[Pandro S. Berman]]) and Sol Fielding. The idea was to make ten to fifteen films a year.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbanks Will Make Episode Film; Schary Boosts Young Producers
Schallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times (1923-1995); Los Angeles, Calif. [Los Angeles, Calif]30 Jan 1952: A7. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="film"&gt;mr. film noir stays at the table
Silver, Alain. Film Comment; New York Vol. 8, Iss. 1,  (Spring 1972): 14-23. &lt;/ref&gt;

''Big Leaguer''  was based on an original story by John McNulty, who sold it to producer Matthew Rapf at [[MGM]]. 

Herbert Butler wrote a script and in November 1952 MGM announced they would make the film under the [[Charles Schnee]] unit. Robinson signed later that month, the first film he had shot at MGM since ''Our Vines Have Tender Grapes''.&lt;ref&gt;JUDGE DISMISSES ACTION BY JARRICO: Rules R. K.

Robert Aldrich had worked at Enterprise Studios as an assistant director and met Herbert Baker on ''[[So This is New York]]''. Baker recommended Aldrich as director because he had worked in television and "knew athletes". "They were looking for "bright young guys" who'd been on the firing line for a while, someone they thought they could give an opportunity to and who knew what he was doing because they didn't," said Aldrich.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt; Aldrich was signed to direct in January 1953.&lt;ref&gt;'Andersen' Sets Record Los Angeles Times 7 Jan 1953: B7. &lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Richards, who was cast a baseball player, had been a baseball player in real life.&lt;ref&gt;Looking at Hollywood: Baseball Movie Will Co-Star Jeff Richards and Hubbell Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Daily Tribune 15 Jan 1953: b2. &lt;/ref&gt;

Spring training filming took place at [[Melbourne, Florida]] with the real life [[New York Giants]]. The film was shot in [[Cape Kennedy]] in 17 days "out of nowhere" said Aldrich.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;

Aldrich remembered star Edward G. Robinson as "a marvellous actor and a brilliant man but he was not physically co ordinated. He would walk to first base and trip over the home plate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTGSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=%22edward+g+robinson%22+%22big+leaguer%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sZBg_RIODW&amp;sig=V-xWEjChynXjesuOxJVrhoIOuug&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjAjKrQ79DeAhVFhlQKHWIgAjs4HhDoATABegQIBBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22edward%20g%20robinson%22%20%22big%20leaguer%22&amp;f=false|page=44|title=The Edward G. Robinson Encyclopedia|first=Robert|last=Beck|publisher=McFarlanddate=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Aldrich said "The world wasn't waiting for that picture. It was a picture about the New York Giants and Metro had the foresight to open it in Brooklyn, so you can't have expected it to do very well. Nothing much came out of it."&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;

According to MGM records the film earned $467,000 in the US and Canada and $92,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $163,000.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt;

The '''Chinese Rugby Football Association''' ('''CRFA''') is the rugby union governing body in [[China]]. Due to the Olympic strategy of China, CRFA has concerned more of the [[rugby sevens]] instead of the 15-men rugby since the beginning of 2000s. CRFA also organises [[American football]] events within China.

Part 1. pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Estadio Azteca 07a.jpg|right|thumb|An internal view of the stadium]]
The Estadio Azteca was designed by architects [[Pedro Ramírez Vázquez]] and [[Rafael Mijares Alcérreca]] and broke ground in 1961. The inaugural match was between [[Club América]] and [[Torino F.C.]] on 29 May 1966, with a capacity for 107,494 spectators. The first goal was scored by Brazilian Arlindo Dos Santos and the second one by Brazilian [[José Alves "Zague"]]; later, the Italians tied the game, which ended in 2–2 draw. Mexican president [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] made the initial kick and [[FIFA]] president [[Sir Stanley Rous]] was the witness.

A modern illumination system was inaugurated on June 5, 1966 with the first night game played between Spanish side [[Valencia C.F.]] and [[Club Necaxa|Necaxa]]. The first goal of the match was scored by [[Honduras|Honduran]] [[José Cardona]] for Valencia. Roberto Martínez, aka Caña Brava, became the first Mexican to score a goal in the stadium after scoring for Necaxa. The result was a 3–1 victory for Valencia.

In 1978 the stadium hosted the final of the [[Copa Interamericana]] between América and [[Boca Juniors]] of [[Argentina]], and would host a final again in 1990 between América and [[Club Olimpia]] of [[Paraguay]].

The Estadio Azteca is also the site in which [[Pelé]] and [[Diego Maradona]] (during the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup]]) lifted the trophy for the last time (The [[FIFA World Cup Trophy#Jules Rimet Trophy|Jules Rimet Trophy]] and the current [[FIFA World Cup Trophy#FIFA World Cup Trophy|FIFA World Cup Trophy]], respectively).

Estadio Azteca has also been used for musical performances throughout its history. [[Michael Jackson]] (5 sold-out shows in 1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cronología Estadio Azteca|url=http://www.esmas.com/estadioazteca/quienes/|accessdate=13 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816080659/http://www.esmas.com/estadioazteca/quienes/|archivedate=16 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[U2]] (in 2006 and 2011), [[Luis Miguel]] (in 2002), [[Elton John]], [[Maná]], [[Juan Gabriel]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Jaguares (band)|Jaguares]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[*Nsync]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[Ana Gabriel]], and [[The Three Tenors]] all have become part of the stadium's main spectacle. The stadium has also been used for political events, including Mexican president [[Felipe Calderón]]'s campaign closure in 2006, as well as religious events, such as Jehovah's Witnesses conventions, and the appearance of Pope [[John Paul II]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pide Juan Pablo II "superar" deficiencias en el progreso social|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/1999/01/26/llama.html|accessdate=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, it was announced that starting July 2018, [[Cruz Azul]] would relocate to the Azteca on a temporary basis, due to the impending demolition of the [[Estadio Azul]]. According to club owner Guillermo Álvarez, they plan on building a new private stadium, which could take an estimated three-to-four years.&lt;ref name="ca2018" /&gt;

===2015–19 renovation plans===

The stadium has undergone gradual improvements and renovations, including the replacing of seating within the stadium as well as the installation of electronic advertising boards. In May 2015, modern [[Panasonic]] LED panels were installed at the north and south ends of the stadium, replacing the phosphorous panels installed in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panasonic's LED Large Screen Displays Provide an All-New Fan Experience at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150608005673/en/Panasonics-LED-Large-Screen-Displays-Provide-All-New |work=[[Business Wire]] |publisher=Business Wire: A Berkshire Hathaway Company |date=8 June 2015 |access-date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, a vast renovation plan was unveiled with the intention that the completion of the project coincide with the stadium's 50th anniversary and with Club América's [[centenary]] in 2016, as well as the construction of a commercial hub outside the stadium to be completed some time in 2019. It was reported that [[Grupo Televisa]], owners of the stadium, approved a joint-venture bid from private development firms IQ Real Estate and Alhel. The hub, named "Foro Azteca", will reportedly consist of a mall, office spaces, two hotels, new leisure spaces and parking spaces for 2,500 cars.&lt;ref name="capacity2" /&gt; The renovations to the stadium were planned in two phases; the first saw the demolition of the restaurant and seating at the lower east stand and the construction of a new hospitality area with dining and banqueting spaces. The second phase consisted of the construction of new media boxes and private skyboxes at the upper west stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico: Azteca to lose capacity again |url=http://stadiumdb.com/news/2016/04/mexico_azteca_to_lose_capacity_again |website=StadiumDB.com |date=4 April 2016 |access-date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovations to the stadium were completed in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=El 'nuevo' Azteca |url=http://www.milenio.com/americano/estadio_azteca-nfl_mexico-oakland-raiders-houston-texans-milenio-la_aficion_0_839316453.html |trans-title=The 'new' Azteca |language=Spanish |work=La Afición |publisher=Grupo Milenio |accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seating capacity was ultimately reduced to 87,000 as a result of the renovations.

==Name==
[[File:Estadio Azteca 07b.jpg|thumb|left|Estadio Azteca prior to a kickoff]]
The name "Azteca" is a tribute to the [[Aztec]] heritage of Mexico City. The stadium is currently owned by Mexican multimedia conglomorate [[Televisa]], which has a heated media rivalry with the similarly-named [[TV Azteca]]. Although there had been little to no confusion between the stadium and television network (which had only come into existence four years before in 1993), Televisa officially changed the stadium's name to '''Estadio Guillermo Cañedo''' on January 20, 1997, in tribute to [[:es:Guillermo Cañedo de la Bárcena|Guillermo Cañedo de la Bárcena]], a top network executive, former [[Mexican Football Federation]] president, and a prominent member of the [[FIFA]] executive committee who had died that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA Senior Vice President Guillermo Cañedo has died|url=https://www.fifa.com/newscentre/news/newsid=70175/index.html|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=21 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the similar situation with the defunct [[Candlestick Park]] in [[San Francisco]] in the United States and its sponsored names, few outside of Televisa itself took up the new name, and most of the general public probably had no thought about the stadium's ownership (much less the Televisa/Azteca rivalry) and continued to refer to the Estadio Azteca by its original (and current) name. After two of Cañedo's sons took a business interest in TV Azteca in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Martínez| first = César| title = Cañedo Whites go to TV Azteca| url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/1998/01/07/canedo.html| work=La Jornada| accessdate = 13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Televisa quietly returned to referring to it solely as Estadio Azteca.

Known colloquially by the nickname "Coloso de Santa Úrsula", which in English translates to "Colossus of Saint Ursula", due to its large structure and [[Santa Úrsula, Mexico City|Santa Úrsula]] referring to the suburb where the stadium is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rai|first=Asha|date=14 March 2014|title=Estadio Azteca: Seasons in the Sun|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-notes/entry/estadio-azteca-seasons-in-the-sun|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access and entrance==
It is served by the Azteca station on the [[Xochimilco Light Rail]] line. This line is an extension of the [[Mexico City metro]] system which begins at [[Metro Tasqueña]] station and ends in the Xochimilco Light Rail Station.

Tickets are available up until kick-off times from the ticket office which is located at the front of the stadium, located towards the exit ramps from the Azteca station. Prices start from as little as [[Mexican peso|MXN$]]100 (about US$5 as of 2016), and could cost up to MXN$500 (about US$26 as of 2016) for more high-profile matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estadio Azteca |url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/azteca/ |publisher=Stadium Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FIU–Miami football brawl''' was a [[bench-clearing brawl]] that occurred on October 14, [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006]] in a [[college football]] game between the [[2006 Miami Hurricanes football team|University of Miami Hurricanes]] and the [[2006 FIU Golden Panthers football team|Florida International University Golden Panthers]] (now Panthers) at the [[Miami Orange Bowl]] in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]].

==Background==
The main campuses of Florida International University (FIU) and the University of Miami are only nine miles (15&amp;nbsp;km) apart. FIU is a [[public university]] located in western Miami (playing at [[FIU Stadium]]), while the University of Miami is a [[private university]] in the suburb of [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]] (which at the time played its home games at the [[Miami Orange Bowl]]). The 2006 game was intended to be the first in the "City Line Series," an annual series between the two Miami-area schools. Miami was heavily favored over FIU,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.covers.com/pageLoader/pageLoader.aspx?page=/data/ncf/teams/pastresults/2006-2007/team70.html|title=Covers.com Miami Hurricanes 2006–2007|accessdate=2010-12-29}} Miami was favored by 27.&lt;/ref&gt; which was in its fifth season of football and in its second year in the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]].

==The brawl==
Throughout the game, players from both teams engaged in [[trash-talk]] and were increasingly physical.  By the third quarter, officials had called seven penalties (six for FIU and one for Miami).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=262872390&amp;quarter=0 Miami-FIU Play-by-Play on ESPN]&lt;/ref&gt;

With 9 minutes left in the 3rd quarter, Miami [[H-back]] [[James Bryant (American football)|James Bryant]] caught a 5-yard [[touchdown]] pass from [[quarterback]] [[Kyle Wright]], making the score 13-0 Miami. After scoring, Bryant pointed towards Miami's West end zone. Bryant, who later transferred to the [[Louisville Cardinals football|University of Louisville]], was [[American football#Penalties|called]] for [[unsportsmanlike conduct]].&lt;ref name="Brawl mars UM-FIU game"&gt;{{cite web|author=Degnan, Susan Miller|title=Brawl mars UM-FIU game|url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/15763312.htm|work=Miami Herald|date=October 15, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104233132/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/15763312.htm|archivedate=November 4, 2006|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ensuing [[Conversion (gridiron football)|PAT]] attempt, FIU safety [[Chris Smith (CFL player)|Chris Smith]] wrestled Miami holder Matt Perelli to the ground after the kick and appeared to punch him in the chin.  FIU cornerback, Marshall McDuffie, Jr., kicked Perelli in the head.&lt;ref name="Fallout From Miami, FIU Reverberates"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Tim|title=Fallout From Miami, FIU Reverberates|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/16/AR2006101600125.html|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=May 31, 2014|date=October 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miami players, including [[Calais Campbell]], came to Perelli's defense, separating Miami and FIU players. FIU's [[Lionell Singleton]] punched Campbell in the back of the helmet, which was quickly followed by retaliation from both teams, escalating the fight to a bench-clearing brawl. Miami's [[Anthony Reddick]] swung his helmet at FIU players and Miami's [[Brandon Meriweather]] kicked an FIU player. FIU's [[A'Mod Ned]], who was previously injured, came onto the field and swung at Miami players with his crutches.  The fight lasted less than two minutes with [[Florida Highway Patrol]] State Troopers and FIU Police coming onto the field to restore order.

Officials needed several minutes to sort out the penalties.  Ultimately, 13 players were assessed 15-yard penalties for fighting and ejected from the game (eight from FIU and five from Miami).&lt;ref name="13 players ejected"&gt;{{cite web|author=Costa, Brian|url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/sports/colleges/fiu/15762949.htm|title=Thirteen players ejected after fight during UM-FIU game|work=Miami Herald|date=October 15, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105000819/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/sports/colleges/fiu/15762949.htm|archivedate=November 5, 2006|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for fighting offset each other, Miami was forced to kick off from its own 10-yard line due to the original penalty against Bryant (penalized at half the distance to the goal).

After the brawl while waiting for the game to resume the Miami team was seen huddled in a circle in the sidelines hopping up and down in what appeared to be a celebratory gesture.  There were also several fights in the stands between UM and FIU fans which were stopped by local police.

Former Miami [[wide receiver]] [[Lamar Thomas]], who was broadcasting the game for [[Comcast/Charter Sports Southeast|Comcast Sports Southeast]] (CSS), made several controversial comments during the scuffle, including:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Now, that’s what I’m talking about. You come into our house, you should get your behind kicked. You don’t come into the OB [Orange Bowl] playing that stuff. You’re across the ocean over there. You’re across the city. You can’t come over to our place talking noise like that. You’ll get your butt beat. I was about to go down the elevator to get in that thing...I say, why don't we meet outside in the tunnel after the ball game and get it on some more? You don't come into the OB, baby. We've had a down couple of years but you don't come in here talking smack. Not in our house.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/15290690/|title=Ex-'Cane Thomas fired for remarks on TV|accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
The incident was instantly condemned by all sides. FIU head coach [[Don Strock]] said he was "embarrassed" for what happened, and said that he would impose sanctions even more severe than any imposed by the [[Sun Belt Conference]], the conference in which FIU played at the time. Miami head coach [[Larry Coker]] said he was "shocked and angered" by the brawl but made no promises of further sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Milian, Jorge |author2=Lisier, Jason|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/content/sports/epaper/2006/10/15/z1bb_um_1015.html|title=Brawl mars UM's shutout|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031055433/http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/content/sports/epaper/2006/10/15/z1bb_um_1015.html|archivedate=October 31, 2006 |accessdate=2007-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, 31 players from both schools — 18 from FIU, 13 from Miami — were handed one-game suspensions by their schools and conferences.&lt;ref name="Coker says he has control of program"&gt;{{cite web|last=Milian|first=Jorge|title=Fight night fallout: Coker says he has control of program|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/content/sports/epaper/2006/10/16/a1c_um_1016.html|work=Palm Beach Post|accessdate=May 31, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017013848/http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/content/sports/epaper/2006/10/16/a1c_um_1016.html|archivedate=October 17, 2006|date=October 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*For FIU: cornerback Marshall McDuffie, Jr., cornerback Chris Smith, offensive lineman Michael Alls, offensive linemen Chad Sales, [[linebacker]] Mannie Wellington, linebacker Michael Dominguez, linebacker Scott Bryant, defensive lineman Roland Clarke, [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] John Ellis, defensive back Cory Fleming, defensive lineman Reginald Jones, defensive back Robert Mitchell, linebacker Quentin Newman, defensive lineman Luis Pena, defensive end Jarvis Penerton, running back Julian Reams, defensive back Lionell Singleton, tight end Samuel Smith and wide receiver Chandler Williams
*For Miami: cornerback Carlos Armour, [[offensive tackle]] Chris Barney, H-back James Bryant, offensive tackle Tyrone Byrd, [[tight end]] DajLeon Farr, wide receiver Ryan Hill, cornerback [[Bruce Johnson (American football)|Bruce Johnson]], [[running back]] Charlie Jones, safety [[Brandon Meriweather]], [[punter (football position)|punter]] Brian Monroe, offensive guard Derrick Morse, cornerback [[Randy Phillips (American football)|Randy Phillips]] and safety Anthony Reddick

In both schools' cases, the suspensions were not staggered, which was unusual considering the number of players involved. The ejected players (Chris Smith, McDuffie, Singleton, Ellis, Williams, Wellington and Penerton for FIU; Morse, Barney, Jones, Armour, Johnson and Samuel Smith for Miami) already faced minimum one-game suspensions under [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] regulations for ejections.

On Monday, Miami's coach suspended Bryant, Merriweather and Reddick indefinitely and announced that the other players would have to complete community service and sit out the next game, against [[Duke Blue Devils football|Duke]]. Miami, which already had a history of such incidents, enacted a "zero tolerance" policy for future incidents: any Hurricane involved in a fight will be suspended for the remainder of the season, and could face permanent banishment from the team. The same day, FIU kicked Chris Smith and McDuffie off the team (though they were allowed to keep their [[athletic scholarship|scholarships]]), and the remaining players were suspended from the team indefinitely. FIU also placed the suspended players on probation for the remainder of the year. In contrast, Miami president [[Donna Shalala]] announced that the other 12 UM players would not face additional suspensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reynolds, Tim|title=Miami Defends Disciplinary Action |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/F/FBC_MIAMI_BRAWL_FALLOUT|publisher=Associated Press|date=October 19, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019072723/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/F/FBC_MIAMI_BRAWL_FALLOUT|archivedate=October 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPN.com's [[Gene Wojciechowski]] called Miami's one-game suspensions "a soothing caress and manicure", suggested that Coker should be fired, and called for Miami to wipe the game from its records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wojciechowski|first=Gene|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/columns/story?id=2628365|title=Laughable suspensions aren't nearly enough|publisher=ESPN|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071202015014/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?id=2628365|archivedate=December 2, 2007|date=October 17, 2006|accessdate=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamar Thomas was fired by CSS, and the network edited out his comments when it rebroadcast the game on October 18. Later in the day, he told [[ESPN Radio]]'s [[Dan Patrick]] that he had gotten carried away in the moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2628184# Lamar Thomas interview by Dan Patrick on ESPN Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coker also came under fire for some of his comments after the incident. "I think that it will affect the image of our program greatly, but in a positive way," he said. "I think that when they see the video and they see how it was handled they will be impressed with our players."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brown, Joel|title=Miami melee: Third quarter brawl overshadows 'Canes' shutout victory|url=http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/uwire/101706aae.html|work=The Hurricane|publisher=University of Miami|date=October 17, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217074312/http://media.www.thehurricaneonline.com/media/storage/paper479/news/2006/10/17/Sports/Miami.Melee-2352490.shtml|archivedate=February 17, 2007|accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His handling of the incident contributed to speculation that he would not return in 2007, Shalala's vote of confidence notwithstanding.&lt;ref name=Bianchi&gt;{{cite web|author=Bianchi, Mike |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-11-10/sports/BIANCHI10_2_1_university-of-miami-um-florida-state |title=To rebuild image, 'Thug U' needs new leadership |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=November 10, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126123331/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/columnists/orl-bianchi10_206nov10%2C0%2C4491214.column?coll=orl-sports-col |archivedate=November 26, 2006 |accessdate=May 31, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two schools played each other in football on September 22, 2018, marking the first game between the two since 2007.

[[File:Good News 1947.jpg|thumb|[[June Allyson]] and [[Peter Lawford]] ]]
'''''Good News''''' is a 1947 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] [[musical film]] based on the 1927 [[Good News (musical)|stage production of the same name]]. It starred [[June Allyson]], [[Peter Lawford]], [[Mel Tormé]], and [[Joan McCracken]]. The [[screenplay]] by [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]] was directed by [[Charles Walters]] in [[Technicolor]].

Three additional songs were written for the film: "The French Lesson", "Pass That Peace Pipe", and "An Easier Way", the last of which was cut from the released film.&lt;ref name=Easier/&gt;

''Good News'' was the second adaptation of the stage musical, after the 1930 film ''[[Good News (1930 film)|Good News]]''. The 1947 film was a more sanitized version of the musical; the 1930 version included [[Pre-Code]] content, such as sexual innuendo and lewd suggestive humor.

==Plot==
The film is set in 1927 at [[fiction]]al Tait College, where [[College football|football]] is all the rage. ("Tait Song"/"Good News")

Tait's football star Tommy Marlowe ([[Peter Lawford]]) is a prime catch for the college girls. Tommy tells his friend and non-playing teammate Bobby Turner (McDonald) that the trick to attracting girls is to show no interest. ("Be a Ladies' Man")

New student Pat McClellan (Marshall) resists his advances, cutting Tommy down to size at a party. ("Lucky in Love") Pat is interested in French, so Tommy enlists part-time school [[librarian]] Connie Lane ([[June Allyson]]) to help him study the language. ("The French Lesson")

He gradually falls for Connie, who comes from a poor background, which does not bother her. ("The Best Things in Life are Free") Meanwhile, Babe Doolittle (McCracken) is seeking to leave a relationship with football player Beef (Tindall) so she can get involved with Bobby Turner.

At a local soda shop, Babe advises Pat not to lose her temper. ("Pass the Peace Pipe")

Connie grows attracted to Tommy, who she feels is not interested. ("Just Imagine") Tommy asks Connie to the prom, but reneges when Pat shows interest. He changes his mind again.  In the end, Tait wins the big game, Tommy pairs off with Connie, Beef pairs off with Pat, and Babe pairs off with Bobby Turner. The college bursts out into song in a production number. ("Varsity Drag")

The '''Honkbal Hoofdklasse''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for ''Major League Baseball'') is the highest level of [[professional baseball]] in the [[Baseball in the Netherlands|Netherlands]]. It is an eight-team [[sports league|league]] that plays a 42-game schedule and is overseen by the [[Royal Netherlands Baseball and Softball Federation]] (KNBSB).

Games are played principally on weekends. The season runs from April to September and is followed by the [[playoffs]] among the four best teams, which culminates in the [[Holland Series]]. Both of the playoff rounds are best-of-five. The league follows a [[promotion and relegation]] system with the [[Honkbal Overgangsklasse]] so that the composition of both levels changes from year to year. Many of the official team nicknames contain the name of the club's corporate sponsor.

The two best teams participate in the [[European Cup (baseball)|European Cup]].

'''ICC Americas''' is an international body which oversees cricket in countries in North and South America, and the Caribbean islands. It is a subordinate body to the [[International Cricket Council]]. The organisation currently has 17 members, located in [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean]], and is responsible for the development, promotion and administration of the game in the above regions.

The body is also responsible for the [[ICC Americas Championship]], which is the premier international competition in the region, and allows teams to compete for [[ICC Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] qualification. The World Cup itself has only been held in the region on a single occasion, when the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]] was hosted by the West Indies. The organisation is also responsible for hosting the [[ICC Americas Under-19 Championship]], which fills a similar role in qualification for the [[Under-19 Cricket World Cup|Under-19 World Cup]]. A separate [[South American Cricket Championship]] exists, but is not organised by the ICC.

Previously the regional office was located in [[Toronto]], but it was relocated to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] in 2016.&lt;ref name="Colorado"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/usa/content/story/996143.html |title=ICC Americas office to relocate from Toronto to Colorado |accessdate=9 April 2016 |work=ESPN Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short-lived '''Cricket Council of the Americas''' (CCAM) was formed in April 2001, after delegates from fifteen countries met in [[Antigua]]. The organisation was patterned after the three existing regional cricket councils at the time,{{Efn|The [[Africa Cricket Association]], the [[Asian Cricket Council]], and the [[European Cricket Council]].}} and it was noted that one of its primary reasons for existence was "to deliver more effectively and efficiently the ICC development programme". It was stated that, as a result of the council's establishment, "the region [would] now be responsible for the strategy and the delivery of its own development programmes, as well as tournament management and funding arrangements".&lt;ref name="nicholas"&gt;Derrick Nicholas (12 April 2001). [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/95180.html "Cricket Council of the Americas formed at historic meeting"] – ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 17 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The council had fifteen members at its peak, listed below.{{Efn|name=Chile}} The inaugural meeting was also attended by delegates from two other countries, [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Mexico]], but those countries were not given membership.&lt;ref&gt;(11 April 2001).

Two gate sets were used for the Olympic Games, one for the first two days (left) and another for the last three days (right).  Each gate set had six upstream gates (red numbers), but gate #12 of the first set was a flush gate with the second pole directly downstream of the first.  Paddlers entered gate #12 from the left wall side and exited into the main current.  Gate #18 of the second set was a downstream flush gate, with entrance from the flow and exit into the eddy.  A 90-degree right turn direct from #18 to #19 was faster than the 270-degree eddy spin used by many contenders. All the gates were double-pole.  There was no use of single-pole gates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcolympics.com/video/canoe-kayak/heats-mens-c-1-k-1.html Accessed 2012-08-08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcolympics.com/video/canoe-kayak/semifinal-final-mens-c-1.html Accessed 2012-08-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Following nomination from [[Broxbourne Borough Council]], Lee Valley White Water Centre won a special commendation at the 2011 Hertfordshire Building Futures Awards in recognition of the excellence of its design in meeting the needs of the sport, and the understated addition it makes to its parkland setting.

The centre has also won or been shortlisted for the following awards: 2012 winner of the Royal Institute of British Architects East Spirit of Ingenuity Award; 2012 winner of Secured by Design Award; 2011 Essex Tourism Awards (shortlisted) Best Large Attraction and Best Tourism Experience.

'''Leichhardt Oval''' is a football stadium in [[Leichhardt, New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It is currently one of two home grounds for the [[Wests Tigers]] [[National Rugby League]] team (the other being ''[[Campbelltown Stadium]]''), and is the former longtime home of the [[Balmain Tigers]], who used the ground from 1934-1994 and 1997-1999.

The ground is considered by some to be antiquated but home supporters and many league fans in general consider it to be good for spectators due to the proximity of supporters to the playing area. The grounds roots lie with the Balmain Tigers who were in the national competition from 1908 to 1999. The Balmain Tigers merged with the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] for the start of season 2000 to become the Wests Tigers.

As of July 2012, Leichhardt Oval is the most played-on Australian professional [[Rugby league playing field|rugby league ground]] in active use in the [[National Rugby League]], having hosted 794 games since Balmain played its first game at the ground against Western Suburbs in Round 1 of the [[1934 NSWRFL season]], held on [[ANZAC Day]], Wests winning the game 18-5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/venues/all.html Rugby League Project - Venues]&lt;/ref&gt; Balmain's first win at the ground came in the very next game of the 1934 season with a 27-13 win over [[Sydney Uni Rugby League Club|University]].

==History==
Leichhardt Oval was first used as a Rugby League football ground in 1934 and became the home ground of the Balmain Tigers. The ground underwent a major overhaul during the 1970s when the configuration of the ground was changed (from east-west to north-south) and lighting installed. As it was one of the few rugby league grounds with lighting and was located close to the city, Leichhardt Oval began to be used for non-Balmain games such as the pre-origin interstate games between [[New South Wales rugby league team|NSW]] and [[Queensland Maroons|Qld]] (Leichhardt was originally preferred to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] for interstate games from 1978 due to dwindling crowds in an era when NSW dominated the contests. Also, unlike the SCG at the time, Leichhardt had lights allowing for night games).

On 16 June 1981, Leichhardt Oval hosted the last ever interstate game between NSW and Qld played under the old 'State of Residence' rules before the permanent move to the now familiar [[State of Origin series]]. The game, which attracted only 6,268 fans, saw the [[Steve Rogers (rugby league)|Steve Rogers]] captain NSW, with Qld Origin players [[John Ribot]], [[Paul McCabe]] and [[Rod Morris]] in the side, win a surprisingly competitive game 22-9. Playing that night were some of the stars of the game at the time including: [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]], [[Noel Cleal]], [[Steve Mortimer]], [[Ray Price (rugby)|Ray Price]] and [[Les Boyd]] (NSW), coached by [[Ted Glossop]], and [[Mal Meninga]], [[Gene Miles]], [[Chris Close]] and [[Wally Lewis]] (Qld), who were captain-coached by [[Arthur Beetson]].

From 1974, with the ground having lights for night football, Leichhardt was also used as the base of the NSWRL's annual [[Amco Cup|mid-week competition]], hosting most of the games and all Finals from 1974 until 1986 before the Final was moved to the new [[Parramatta Stadium]] in [[1987 National Panasonic Cup|1987]]. The last Mid-week Final held at Leichhardt was the [[1986 National Panasonic Cup#Final|1986 National Panasonic Cup Final]], with the [[Parramatta Eels]] defeating Balmain 32-16.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eio5RsO9Ka8 1986 National Panasonic Cup Final - Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August 1985 a crowd of 21,707 set a then Balmain Tigers ground attendance record for a Round 22 clash in the [[1985 NSWRL season|1985]] [[Winfield Cup]] against the [[St. George Dragons]], won 17-15 by St. George.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Balmain left the ground after the [[1994 NSWRL season]] when they moved to Parramatta Stadium as part of an identity change to the Sydney Tigers. The move was not popular with supporters however and the club returned to Leichhardt for the 1997 season (the Balmain name also returned). Balmain played their final game as a stand-alone team in 1999 when they defeated Parramatta 20–10 in appalling conditions. The ground then became one of the home grounds of the new Wests Tigers team.

==Leichhardt Oval Today (2000 - present)==
The ground remains a venue for high level rugby league in Australia although it currently holds only four [[National Rugby League|NRL]] games a year. This decision to reduce the amount of games is mainly financial and related to issues such as ground capacity, corporate facilities, and financial incentives to play games at [[Stadium Australia]]. Ironically for a ground once prized for its lighting, the cost of playing night games is another factor as the current lighting is not considered acceptable.

In spite (or perhaps because) of its antiquated facilities, Leichhardt Oval is beloved by Tigers fans especially those who formerly supported Balmain. Match attendances are usually close to or at capacity. Attempts to improve facilities are underway with the goal to return Leichhardt to its place as a top level rugby league venue.

In 2007 the [[New South Wales]] Government announced it would provide finance to help in the redevelopment of the ground [http://www.villagevoice.com.au/article/20070904/NWS03/709040344/Leichhardt+Oval+set+for+improvement]. Previously it had provided a loan to match grants made from Leichhardt Council and the Balmain Football Club. A group known as Stop the Rot aims to revamp the ground into a first class sporting venue. [[A.P.I.A. Leichhardt Tigers]] were renamed Sydney Tigers before the start of the 2009 New South Wales Premier League, and moved their home ground from Lambert Park back to Leichhardt Oval, for the first time in over a decade. [[A-League]] club [[Sydney FC]] also played a pre-season friendly against rivals [[Central Coast Mariners]] on 6 June 2009.

On 21 November 2009 Leichhardt Oval hosted 2 matches in a double-header of the W-League (Australia). [[Sydney FC W-League|Sydney FC]] took on [[Perth Glory W-League|Perth Glory]] while after that [[Melbourne Victory W-League|Melbourne Victory]] played the [[Central Coast Mariners W-League|Central Coast Mariners]]. During 2009, the thirty-year lease of Leichhardt Oval by the West Tigers Franchise, came to an end. It is not known what further activity will be conducted by the West Tigers franchise. The local business arm of the Tigers, the Balmain Leagues Club, continues on its long haul to financially restructure, following financial losses in 2008 and 2009.

In 2009 the Keith Barnes Stand and Norm Robinson Stand were named in honour of Balmain Tigers greats, [[Keith Barnes]] and [[Norm Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Massoud|first=Josh|title=Tigers stand plan takes hit|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/tigers-stand-plan-takes-hit/story-e6frexnr-1225732655325|accessdate=26 May 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2010, the Balmain Tigers have yet to make a further commitment to returning to play the overall majority of their matches, using Leichhardt Oval.

From 2005 until 2012, it was home of the [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain-Ryde Eastwood Tigers]] (an amalgamation between Balmain and the old [[Bundaberg Red Cup|Sydney Metropolitan League]] side [[Ryde Eastwood Rugby League Club|Ryde Eastwood]]), who played in the [[New South Wales Cup]] competition. In 2013, the club joined forces with the Western Suburb Magpies, and formed the [[Wests Tigers]] (just like the first grade competition). This NSW Cup club now share its home games between Leichhardt Oval and Campbelltown Stadium.

The Australian [[rugby union]] football team [[Sydney Stars]], a joint venture between the [[Sydney Uni Football Club|Sydney University]] and [[Balmain RFC|Balmain]] rugby clubs, announced Leichhardt Oval as its home ground in the [[National Rugby Championship]] (NRC).

On 28 June 2015, the laneway at Leichhardt Oval was named "Laurie's Lane" in honour of former long-time [[Balmain Tigers]] fan Laurie Nichols.

==Attendance Record==
The stadium has a nominal capacity of 20,000, with recorded highest crowd figures of 23,000 for the 1981 [[Tooth and Co.|KB Tooth]] Final between [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] and [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks|Cronulla]], and 22,877 for the 24 July 2005 [[2005 NRL season|NRL]] game of Wests Tigers versus South Sydney, in which the Tigers won 42-20. The highest recorded crowd for a Balmain Tigers game of 22,750 was set on 27 August 1989, for a Round 22 [[NSWRL]] game against the [[Penrith Panthers]], won 33-6 by the [[1989 NSWRL season#Grand Final|Grand Final]] bound Tigers.

'''[[Libya]]''' made its [[Paralympic Games]] début as the Great Socialist People's [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] at the [[1996 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Atlanta]], sending four representatives to compete in [[powerlifting]]. The country has competed at every edition of the [[Summer Paralympics]] since then, but has never taken part in the [[Winter Paralympics]]. Libyan delegations have always been fairly small: three judokas, two powerlifters and a volleyball team in 2000; two powerlifters in 2004; a powerlifter and two table tennis players in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=LBA&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Libya at the Paralympics], [[International Paralympic Committee]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Libya won its first&amp;mdash;and so far only&amp;mdash;Paralympic medal when [[Abdelrahim Hamed]] took bronze in the men's over 100kg in powerlifting in 2000, lifting {{convert|235|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=LBA&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Libya at the Paralympics], International Paralympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1979 '''merger of the NHL and WHA''' was the culmination of several years of negotiations between the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) that resulted in the WHA and all of its surviving franchises folding in return for the owners of four of the WHA's six surviving teams (the [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Hartford Whalers|New England Whalers]], [[Quebec Nordiques]], and [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]]) being granted expansion franchises that commenced play in the NHL for the [[1979–80 NHL season|1979–80 season]]. The agreement officially took effect on June 22, 1979. The merger ended the seven-year existence of the WHA and re-established the NHL as the lone major league in North American professional [[ice hockey]].

The two leagues had discussed the possibility of merging for numerous years, despite the acrimonious relationship between the two after the WHA aggressively recruited NHL players upon the former's founding in 1971. The two sides came close to an agreement in 1977, but the merger was defeated by a group of hard-line NHL owners. The NHL also initially rejected the 1979 agreement by one vote. However, a massive boycott of [[Molson]] products in [[Canada]] led the [[Montreal Canadiens]], who were owned by the Molson family, to reverse their position in a second vote along with the [[Vancouver Canucks]], allowing the plan to pass.

As part of the agreement, the NHL treated the WHA teams' arrival as an expansion rather than an outright merger. The former WHA clubs were stripped of most of their players, and NHL teams were given the right to reclaim players from the WHA clubs without compensation. As a concession for being stripped of most of their players, the former WHA clubs were permitted to keep two goaltenders and two skaters. The four former WHA teams were also placed at the end of the draft order for the [[1979 NHL Entry Draft]], as opposed to previous and future NHL expansion teams, which had been placed at or very near the front of the draft order.

==Background==
Since the demise of the [[Western Canada Hockey League]] in 1926, the NHL had existed as the only major professional North American ice hockey league. After dwindling to the [[Original Six]] in 1942, the NHL remained stable until the 1960s. Following speculation that the [[Western Hockey League (minor pro)|Western Hockey League]] intended to declare itself a major league, the NHL was entertaining serious expansion discussions by 1963,&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Diamond|first=Dan|year=1991|title=The Official National Hockey League 75th Anniversary Commemorative Book|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|isbn=0-7710-6727-5|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminating four years later with the [[1967 NHL expansion|addition of six new teams]] for the [[1967–68 NHL season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pincus|first=Arthur|year=2006|title=The Official Illustrated NHL History|publisher=Readers Digest|isbn=0-88850-800-X|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHA was founded in 1971 with ten teams, and intended to operate as a direct competitor to the NHL. By its [[1972–73 WHA season|inaugural season]], 67 NHL players had defected to the new league.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"&gt;{{Cite book |last=McFarlane |first=Brian |year=1990|title=100 Years of Hockey|publisher=Summerhill Press|isbn=0-929091-26-4}}{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] star [[Bobby Hull]] lent immediate credibility to the fledgling circuit when he signed a 10-year contract with the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]] for $2.7 million, the largest in hockey history at the time.&lt;ref name="Willes"/&gt; The NHL attempted to block the defections in court, earning an injunction against the Jets that initially prevented several players, including Hull, from playing in the WHA. The new league challenged the orders, stating that the NHL's [[reserve clause]], which tied players' rights to their NHL team for life, was illegal.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt; A [[Philadelphia]] district court sided with the WHA in November 1972, striking down the reserve clause and freeing all players to play in the WHA. The ruling ended the NHL's monopoly on talent.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt;

The WHA also challenged the older league by placing teams in NHL markets, including the [[Philadelphia Blazers]] ([[Philadelphia Flyers]]), Vancouver Blazers ([[Vancouver Canucks]]), [[Toronto Toros]] ([[Toronto Maple Leafs]]), and [[Chicago Cougars]] (Chicago Black Hawks), among others. The WHA's existence led the NHL to hastily expand to [[Atlanta]] and [[Long Island]] in 1972 to keep the rival loop out of the newly-completed [[Omni Coliseum]] and [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Boer |first=Peter |title=The Calgary Flames |year=2006 |publisher=Overtime Books |isbn=1-897277-07-5 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merger talks==
Merger talks between the two leagues had been ongoing since 1973, when NHL governors [[William M. Jennings|Bill Jennings]] of the [[New York Rangers]] and [[Ed Snider]] of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] unsuccessfully approached the WHA and offered to have all 12 of its franchises join the NHL for $4 million each.&lt;ref name="Willes"&gt;{{Cite book |last=McFarlane |first=Brian |year=1990|title=100 Years of Hockey|publisher=Summerhill Press|isbn=0-929091-26-4}}{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts at reconciliation were frequently blocked by Toronto's [[Harold Ballard]], Chicago's [[Bill Wirtz]], and Boston's [[Paul A. Mooney]], owners of the three NHL teams most affected by the WHA's player raids.&lt;ref name="Willes"/&gt; By 1976, however, both leagues were struggling under the financial pressures of competing against each other on the ice and in the courtroom.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt; Bobby Hull had become an outspoken proponent of a merger between the two leagues,&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt; though [[Gordie Howe]] (the NHL's all-time scoring leader-turned-WHA player) and WHA president [[Bill MacFarland (ice hockey)|Bill MacFarland]] disagreed, arguing that the WHA was sustainable indefinitely.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt;

Long time NHL President [[Clarence Campbell]] was fiercely opposed to any union between the two leagues, saying, "They're our rivals. They were people that did their best to destroy us. Why would we salvage them now? To hell with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='To he** with them; let them die on vine' |work=Calgary Herald |date=June 2, 1977 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this animosity, some NHL teams agreed to play preseason exhibition games against WHA opponents prior to the 1974–75 season. Campbell ordered this interleague play halted in 1975, but the following year, the NHL president (who by this time was facing both declining health and personal scandal) relented and interleague exhibition games resumed, although a few NHL clubs, including Montreal and Toronto, continued to boycott them.

Campbell retired in 1977, and his successor, [[John Ziegler (ice hockey)|John Ziegler]] (the NHL's first American chief executive), was more open to unification. Under Ziegler's presidency, interleague exhibition games became more common, eventually involving every NHL team except Los Angeles, Buffalo, Toronto, and Montreal. Merger negotiations also intensified, and continued to be conducted openly. The American teams were far less hostile to the idea of a merger than their Canadian counterparts. There were a number of reasons for this, but probably the most compelling was the [[Montreal Canadiens]]' dominance of the NHL during the years of the WHA's existence. The Canadiens won five of the seven Stanley Cups during this time, including four in a row from 1976 through 1979. The [[1976–77 Montreal Canadiens season|1976–77 Canadiens]] in particular are widely considered to be the most dominant team in NHL history. Montreal owed this success in large part to its ability to better resist WHA efforts to lure away its players (a notable exception being [[J.C. Tremblay]], who left the Canadiens to play for the WHA's [[Quebec Nordiques]]), and many American teams believed they were able to do this because Canadian ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' television revenues were mostly distributed among the three Canadian teams instead of across the league. Hence, adding Canadian teams would lessen the financial advantage that teams like the Canadiens had. Also, both NHL and WHA owners realized that the Canadian markets were a vital economic base, both to the WHA and any future rival league that might take its place. Absorbing the Canadian markets would therefore preclude the possibility of the NHL having to fight off another rival league.

However, American support for a merger was based on the assumption that all existing NHL teams would share the expansion fees equally; this did not go over well with the league's Canadian owners. The objection was not without precedent; in 1970, Montreal and Toronto had only agreed to support Vancouver's addition to the NHL after they were paid indemnities for the inclusion of the Canucks in the ''Hockey Night in Canada'' television deal. Although the three Canadian teams could not block a merger on their own, the fact that any deal needed three-quarters support among the NHL owners meant that the Canadian teams only needed two American clubs to side with them to block any agreement.

In June 1977, Ziegler announced that the NHL had created a committee to investigate the possibility of a merger, while [[William DeWitt, Jr.|Bill DeWitt, Jr.]], owner of the WHA's [[Cincinnati Stingers]], stated that Ziegler had invited six WHA teams to join the NHL for the [[1977–78 NHL season|1977–78 season]] if various conditions could be met. This proposal would have seen the six teams become full NHL members, but play in their own division with a separate schedule for the first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Expansion, merger, accommodation — whatever |work=Calgary Herald |date=June 25, 1977 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by Toronto's [[Harold Ballard]], the owners voted down Ziegler's proposal.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt; The [[Calgary Cowboys]], who had hoped to be one of the six teams to join the NHL, subsequently folded, as did the [[Phoenix Roadrunners (WHA)|Phoenix Roadrunners]], [[Minnesota Fighting Saints]], and [[San Diego Mariners]]. This reduced the WHA to eight teams for the [[1977–78 WHA season]], and left its long-term future in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gammons |first=Peter |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1092909/index.htm |title=Quebec just hopes it will have a league to play in |work=Sports Illustrated |date=October 17, 1977 |accessdate=April 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1978 revised agreement==
[[File:NHLWHAmerger.png|right|300px|thumb|Cities that hosted NHL and WHA teams at the time of the [[NHL-WHA merger]] in 1979]]
The intense competition between the leagues did not leave the NHL unscathed, as by 1978 it faced the possibility of two of its teams (the [[Minnesota North Stars]] and [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]]) folding. Ziegler was able to mitigate the damage by arranging a merger between the two clubs; the Barons remain the most recent example of an American professional sports team in an established major league ceasing operations.

Merger discussions resumed in 1978, and it again appeared that the [[Houston Aeros (WHA)|Houston Aeros]], as one of the league's strongest teams, were an obvious candidate to join the NHL. Unfortunately for Houston, by this time Ziegler realized NHL owners would never vote to admit six teams, and floated a proposal that would admit four WHA franchises. The WHA responded by insisting that all three of its Canadian teams be included in the merger. This left room for only one American team, with the only serious contenders for that spot being the Aeros and Whalers. Aeros owner Kenneth Schnitzer attempted to persuade [[Boston Bruins]] owner [[Jeremy Jacobs]] to support a merger that included the Aeros and not the Bruins' neighbors based in Hartford, only to find that Jacobs, as one of the older league's most hard-line owners, was opposed to any sort of merger with the WHA and that Ziegler was cool to the idea of adding another [[Sun Belt]] NHL team. Of the three Sun Belt teams that had joined the league since 1967, one (the [[California Golden Seals]]) had already relocated and two (the [[Los Angeles Kings]] and [[Atlanta Flames]]) were struggling financially.

During the final series of talks, it soon became evident that no merger of any sort would take place in time for the [[1978-79 NHL season]]. It was also apparent that when there was a merger, the Aeros were not likely to be included. Schnitzer announced that the Aeros would not take part in the [[1978-79 WHA season]]. He first applied for direct admission to the NHL, only to find the older league uninterested in such an expansion with so many of its existing franchises struggling. Finally, Schnitzer campaigned to be allowed to purchase an existing club and relocate it to Houston. The obvious candidate to move was the [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]] (the former Seals), who were on the verge of folding. Schnitzer believed the older league would accept almost any other proposal as an alternative to the perceived embarrassment of having to disband a franchise, and did come close to a deal to relocate the moribund Barons franchise to Houston. However, the NHL instead opted to approve a proposal from the owners of the [[Minnesota North Stars]] to buy the Barons  franchise and "merge" it with their own. Having run out of options, Schnitzer folded the Aeros on July 9, 1978. In doing so, the Aeros became the only WHA champion that did not eventually join the NHL.

Discussion between the two leagues intensified into the 1978–79 season, when the WHA made an offer to have five teams join the NHL the following year, paying $5 million each for the right to join. Although the WHA offer was not accepted, Ziegler was encouraged, stating that owners were beginning to view the negotiations from a business standpoint rather than an emotional one.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt; The WHA then lost the [[Indianapolis Racers]] after only 25 games, reducing the league to six teams, the lowest in league history.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt;

==Final agreement==
With the WHA facing financial difficulty and unable to meet payrolls, the two leagues reached an agreement to merge in March 1979, pending ratification by the NHL's owners. The NHL originally wanted to take in the [[Hartford Whalers|New England Whalers]], [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]], and [[Edmonton Oilers]]. The owners of the [[Cincinnati Stingers]] and [[Birmingham Bulls]] were resigned to their exclusion from the merger, but the [[Quebec Nordiques]] fought the proposal. The NHL's American teams were less enthusiastic about including Quebec than they were about Edmonton and Winnipeg, and Ziegler thought that the Canadiens might be persuaded to support the merger if the Nordiques were excluded.

Nevertheless, the WHA insisted on including all three of its surviving Canadian teams in the merger and Ziegler finally agreed to put the matter to a vote of the NHL's Board of Governors.&lt;ref name="Champions"&gt;{{cite book |title=Champions: The Illustrated History of Hockey's Greatest Dynasties |last=Hunter |first=Douglas |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=Triumph Books |location=[[Chicago]] |isbn=1-57243-213-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting in [[Key Largo, Florida]], 12 of the 17 owners supported the proposal – one short of the required three-fourths majority (13 teams out of 17 would have represented 76.5% of the league, just past that threshold, but as the vote stood, it only represented 70.6%).&lt;ref name="Willes"/&gt; The five teams that voted against the merger were the Canadiens, [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[Boston Bruins]], [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], and [[Los Angeles Kings]].&lt;ref name="Champions"/&gt;

The five teams that cast a "no" ballot did so for different reasons. The Bruins were not pleased with the prospect of sharing [[New England]] with the Whalers, while the Canadiens were even less enamored with having to share the province of [[Quebec]] with the Nordiques. The Canadiens, Canucks, and Maple Leafs disliked the idea of having to split ''Hockey Night in Canada'' revenues six ways rather than three, while the Canucks and Kings feared the loss of dates with NHL teams from the east.&lt;ref name="Willes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Champions"/&gt; Maple Leafs' owner Ballard had a personal grudge as well; he had never forgiven the WHA for plundering his roster in the early 1970s.

The Canadiens were owned by [[Molson|Molson Brewery]], and when news emerged that the Canadiens had voted against the deal, fans in Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Quebec City organized a boycott of Molson products, believing that Molson was standing in the way of their cities remaining big-league hockey towns.&lt;ref name="Champions"/&gt; The boycott quickly spread nationwide. It caused a drain on the Canucks' revenue as well, since [[Pacific Coliseum]] sold Molson products. The [[House of Commons of Canada]] weighed in as well, unanimously passing a motion urging the NHL to reconsider. A second vote was held in [[Chicago]] on March 22, 1979, which passed by a 14–3 margin as both Montreal and Vancouver reversed their positions.&lt;ref name="Willes"/&gt; Both teams' hands were forced by the boycott, and the Canucks were also won over by the promise of a balanced schedule, with each team playing the others twice at home and twice on the road.&lt;ref name="Champions"/&gt;

The agreement resulted in the Oilers, Whalers, Nordiques, and Jets joining the NHL for the [[1979–80 NHL season]]. However, the NHL insisted on treating the WHA teams' arrival as an expansion, not a merger. The WHA teams each had to pay a $6 million franchise fee for the right to enter the NHL&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt; – however, since this was nominally the same fee paid by all of the other teams that joined the NHL in the 1970s (a decade of high inflation), the financial terms of the agreement were nominally quite favorable to the WHA although some of the teams that joined earlier in the decade received concessions on their fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19770302&amp;id=yztOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=su0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4429,313906|title=Franchise fees reduced|date=March 2, 1977|work=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two remaining WHA teams, the Stingers and Bulls, were paid $1.5 million apiece in [[parachute payment]]s and joined the [[Central Hockey League (1963–1984)|Central Hockey League]], the league-owned minor league, for one season each.&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Champions"/&gt; The Stingers folded after 33 games; the Bulls played two full seasons before folding.

The rest of the agreement was slanted heavily in the NHL's favour. The NHL held a reclamation draft for the established clubs, in which nearly all of the players who had bolted from the NHL and were still active in the WHA saw their rights revert to their NHL clubs without compensation. The WHA clubs were stripped of nearly all of their players; for all intents and purposes, they were effectively dissolved and had to rebuild their rosters from scratch. However, in one of the few concessions to the WHA teams, they were allowed to protect two goalies and two skaters. Even more controversial was the NHL's insistence that the four new teams be placed at the bottom of the order for the [[1979 NHL Entry Draft]]. Historically, the NHL slots expansion teams at or near the top in an entry draft. In what was not a complete coincidence, the NHL also lowered the draft age by two years, effectively tripling the size and depth of the talent pool in the 1979 draft. The former WHA teams were restocked via the [[1979 NHL Expansion Draft]] with the established NHL teams receiving $125,000 per player taken in that draft. However. these payments formed part of the former WHA teams' $6 million franchise fees.&lt;ref name="McKinley"/&gt; Additionally, a good number of players on the list were either retired or of little value; years later Oilers coach/general manager [[Glen Sather]] said that the WHA teams knew this, but went along only because they had to participate.&lt;ref name="Champions"/&gt;

As the league considered the agreement to be an expansion as opposed to a merger, it refused to recognize WHA records. The four new NHL franchises were essentially regarded as new entities, not as continuations of the former WHA franchises. The Canadian teams were permitted to operate under their established names, colors, logos and front office personnel, however, to appease and satisfy the Bruins, the NHL insisted that the Whalers drop "New England" from their name and they entered the league as the "Hartford Whalers" instead. The NHL continues to recognize all four franchises as having been founded on June 22, 1979, which is also the date the WHA is reckoned to have formally ceased to exist.

==Aftermath==
The NHL had originally intended to place one of the former WHA teams in each of its four divisions (then called the Adams, Norris, Patrick and Smythe), but the Oilers and Jets lobbied to be placed in the same division as the Canucks. The league agreed, although its decision to play a balanced league-wide schedule rendered the divisional alignment irrelevant for the first two seasons following the merger. Nevertheless, the divisions were formally retained.

Although the WHA clubs had performed quite well against their NHL rivals in pre-merger exhibition games (of 63 such games played, the WHA won 34, lost 22 and tied 7)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whahockey.com/whavsnhl.html List of WHA-NHL exhibition games]&lt;/ref&gt; they were nevertheless expected to struggle on the ice after the merger due to the purging of their rosters. However, the NHL also expanded the Stanley Cup playoffs from 12 teams to 16. This allowed the Whalers and Oilers to qualify for the playoffs in their first post-merger season although both teams were swept in the first round. The following year, the Oilers became the first former WHA team to win a playoff series when they swept the heavily favoured Canadiens.

==Legacy==
In its seven seasons, the WHA paid its players $120 million, and lost over $50 million.&lt;ref name="SIobituary"&gt;{{cite web |last=Davis |first=Reyn |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1094980/1/index.htm |title=A Nowhere Ride |work=Sports Illustrated |date=May 28, 1979 |accessdate=April 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition for talent introduced by the WHA, and accelerated by the signing of Bobby Hull, led to a rapid escalation of salaries for players in both leagues. For the first time, hockey players had meaningful leverage in contract negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oler |first=Van |url=http://blackhawks.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=369070&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;service=page |title=Golden Guts |publisher=Chicago Blackhawks Hockey Club |date=July 8, 2008 |accessdate=April 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its search for talent, the WHA turned to the previously overlooked European market, signing players from [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]. [[Anders Hedberg]], [[Lars-Erik Sjöberg|Lars-Erik Sjoberg]], and [[Ulf Nilsson (ice hockey)|Ulf Nilsson]] signed with the Jets in 1974 and thrived in North America, both in the WHA and later the NHL.&lt;ref name="McKinley"&gt;{{Cite book |last=McKinley |first=Michael |year=2006|title=Hockey: A People's History|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|isbn=0-7710-5769-5|url=http://www.cbc.ca/hockeyhistory/}}{{page needed|date= April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jets won three of the six remaining WHA championships after signing European players, and their success sparked similar signings league-wide. Many of these players went on to NHL careers.

Of the four WHA teams that joined the NHL, only the Edmonton Oilers remain in their WHA city today. The other three franchises all moved within a three-year period in the 1990s: the Nordiques became the [[Colorado Avalanche]] in 1995, the Jets became the [[Phoenix Coyotes]] in 1996, and the Whalers (renamed the [[Hartford Whalers]] upon admission to the NHL in 1979) became the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] in 1997. The Oilers nearly followed the other three teams south the following year after financially strapped owner [[Peter Pocklington]] received an offer from a buyer in [[Houston]], but a local ownership group was able to assemble the financing needed to keep the team in Edmonton. The Oilers were eventually acquired by Edmonton-based billionaire [[Daryl Katz]], who continues to own the team in Edmonton today.

Of the three cities to have lost their WHA/NHL teams, only Winnipeg has received one back when the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] relocated there in [[2011–12 NHL season|2011]]. The Oilers are the only WHA team to win the [[Stanley Cup]] while in their WHA city, which they have done on five occasions (1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1990). The Avalanche won the Stanley Cup in 1996, their first year after leaving Quebec, and won a second Cup in 2001. The Hurricanes won their only Stanley Cup in 2006, their ninth year after leaving Hartford. The Jets/Coyotes franchise has never appeared in the Stanley Cup Finals, and has advanced to the second playoff round only three times (1985, 1987, 2012) and the conference final once (2012).

Notwithstanding the NHL's non-recognition of WHA records, all four surviving WHA teams subsequently retired at least one jersey number in recognition of on-ice endeavors achieved exclusively or primarily in the WHA. The three teams that re-located in the 1990s took different approaches with respect to the retired numbers - both Colorado and Carolina disclaimed their teams' pre-relocation histories in both the WHA and NHL and re-entered all previously retired numbers into circulation, regardless of league (although notably, the Hurricanes have never issued the #9 worn by [[Gordie Howe]] and retired by the Whalers). On the other hand, the Coyotes decided to hang all previously retired Jets' numbers in the rafters including, notably, the #9 of [[Bobby Hull]] notwithstanding the fact Hull only played 18 games for the Jets in their first NHL season (the last of his career). In doing so, the Coyotes implicitly recognized the Winnipeg Jets' entire history from 1972 to 1996 as their own. The Coyotes later temporarily un-retired #9 so Hull's son [[Brett Hull|Brett]] could wear it for the final five games of his NHL career. By the time the NHL returned to Winnipeg, the league had taken over the Coyotes [[Phoenix Coyotes bankruptcy|following bankruptcy]] and had even entertained an offer from the eventual Thrashers' purchasers to return the Coyotes to Manitoba. The league therefore had to decide whether to allow the former Thrashers to reclaim the Jets' name and history. In the end, the NHL decided to allow Winnipeg to reclaim its former name, but not its pre-1996 history. The pre-1996 Jets history therefore remained with the Arizona franchise while the Winnipeg franchise retained the Thrashers' history (the Thrashers did not retire any numbers while in Atlanta). The "new" Jets immediately and controversially recognized the league's decision by re-issuing Hull's #9 to [[Evander Kane]], who had worn the same number with the Thrashers.

The merger led the league to reconsider other Canadian cities it had previously rejected placing franchises in. One year after the merger, the [[Atlanta Flames]] [[Calgary Flames|relocated to Calgary]], becoming [[Battle of Alberta|archrivals]] of the Oilers in the process. In 1992, the NHL added [[Ottawa Senators|an expansion franchise]] in Ottawa. Both of these teams remain in their respective cities. However, the league has repeatedly rejected bids to bring NHL franchises to the Canadian cities of [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Saskatoon]].

==Venues==
The sports park consists of eight venues:
*[[Olympiahalle (Innsbruck)|Olympiahalle Innsbruck]]
*[[Tivoli-Neu|Tivoli Stadium]]
*[[Tyrolean Ice Arena|Tiroler Wasserkraft Arena]]
*Tirol Sports Center
*[[Olympic Sliding Centre Innsbruck]]
*Indoor Funsporthallen
*Außenanlagen

The '''Point O'Woods Golf &amp; Country Club''' is a private [[country club|golf club]] located in [[Benton Charter Township, Michigan|Benton Township]], Berrien County, Michigan, United States, near [[Benton Harbor, Michigan|Benton Harbor]].

==History==
In 1954, local residents C.E. (Bud) Blake, Charles W. Gore, Richard Merrill, Malcolm Ross and [[Frederick and Louis Upton|Frederick S. Upton]] expressed interest in a new golf club in the [[Benton Harbor, Michigan|Benton Harbor]]/[[St. Joseph, Michigan|St. Joseph]] area. When land owned by Donald H. Ross became available, the group contacted [[Robert Trent Jones]] to inquire whether he approved of the location as viable for a championship golf course; after inspection of the property, he was impressed and agreed to design the course. After the group secured funding, the project proceeded: Ground was broken in the Spring of 1957, and the course opened June 14, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://pointowoods.memberstatements.com/tour/tours.cfm?tourID=6442 The History of Point O Woods]".

'''Short mat bowls''' is an indoor [[sport]] in which players attempt to score points by rolling a heavy ball along a  fairly flat surface, to gain as many shots as possible by getting their bowls nearer to the jack than their opponents, and so outscore them. The game is a modern variation on [[lawn bowls]], from which it is derived.

==Venues==
Short mat bowls is played indoors, so it is an all-year sport that is not affected by weather conditions. Because the equipment is transportable and easy to set up, it is particularly appropriate for locations that are also used for other purposes such as village halls, schools, and sports and social clubs; it is even played on [[North Sea oil]] rigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.notlbowls.ca/History%20of%20Short%20Mat%20Bowling.pdf |title=History of short mat bowling |work=Notlbowls.ca |accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
The ESMBA specify a rink mat length of {{Convert|40–45|ft|abbr=on}} with a width of {{Convert|6|ft|abbr=on}}. The mat is foam or rubber-backed, and has the required lines permanently marked. A wooden fender is placed at both ends to keep the bowls from rolling off the mat. A block sits in the middle of the mat; players have to avoid having their bowls hit the block on their way down the mat. The 'jack' is the target that sits near the end of the mat.&lt;ref name=murphy2015&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=A.|title=Working with Elderly People: A Care Worker's Handbook|date=28 April 2015|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-78462-052-3|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to its counterparts, short mat uses a super-heavyweight jack that weighs approximately {{Convert|900|g|abbr=on}}, whereas, indoor bowls use {{Convert|382-453|g|abbr=on}}, and long mat (Grass) between {{convert|225-285|g|abbr=on}} &lt;ref name="Lawn Bowls FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valebowlingclub.co.uk/lawn_bowls_faqs.htm|accessdate=10 October 2017|publisher=Vale Bowling Club|title=Lawn Bowls FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Length of play===
As with most variants of bowls, short mat bowls has a variable length of play. In traditional games such as [[crown green bowls]] and [[indoor bowls]], winning lead players have the opportunity to throw the jack to the length they wish to play the next end from. In short mat bowls; the game has been simplified, to allowing the winning skip to simply place the jack on a 'jack line'; to determine the length of the next end.

==How the game is played==
Short mat bowls is very similar to lawn bowls in that the object is for each player, or team, to take turns rolling bowls (balls) down a mat in an attempt to get as many of the bowls as possible closer to the target (the 'jack') than the opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Guide to Short Mat Bowls|url=http://www.hsmba.org/page134.html|website=www.hsmba.org|accessdate=10 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference is in the size of the playing area and the presence of the block midway down the rink mat. The presence of the block prevents players from knocking their opponents' bowls away from the jack by sheer force; players are required to use the natural bias of the bowls to maneuver around the block. Any bowls that touch the block, or land in the ditch or dead area, are dead and are removed before the next bowl. The skill in playing short mat bowls comes from the bias of the ball and the inconsistent playing surface; both the performance of the rink mat and the floor surface can vary between matches in different venues. A general description of different bowls games, including short mat bowls, is maintained at ''bowls.org.uk''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Short Mat Bowls - Your Complete Guide to The Rules &amp; Equipment|url=https://www.bowls.org.uk/short-mat|website=Bowls.org.uk|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origin of the short mat bowls game is uncertain, but one story is that it was first played in [[Wales]] by two [[South Africans]] who came to work in the area. They had played [[bowls]] outdoors in South Africa and, perhaps due to the poor climate and the long close season in Wales, they began to play a simulation of the outdoor game on a strip of carpet in a church hall. Some time later, they moved to [[Northern Ireland]] and took the new game with them. Rules and conditions of play were drawn up and the game soon became well established in the Province. It was introduced into England by [[Irish expatriate]]s, but development was slow until the 1980s when its potential as a low cost sport for people of all ages was realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pickup |first=Gilly |title=What the British Invented: From the Great to the Downright Bonkers |date=15 November 2015 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |isbn=978-1-4456-5028-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English Short Mat Bowling Association (ESMBA) was formed in 1984, and is now the governing body of the sport in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English Short Mat Bowling Association ESMBA|url=http://www.esmba.co.uk|website=www.esmba.co.uk|accessdate=10 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sport is administered in England at two levels, the ESMBA oversee administration of the National Championships and Inter County Championships in addition to running the National Squad. At a more local level, 37 County Associations arrange a series of League, One Day and Knockout competitions within their own geographical area.

In 2009, the ESMBA launched a new National Club Championship event, the event featuring teams competing in all-four disciplines (Singles, Pairs, Triples &amp; Fours), with all members being from the same club team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English Short Mat Bowling Association 2017-18- ESMBA Championship/|url=http://www.esmba.co.uk/tournaments/2017-18-esmba-tlh-championship/|website=www.esmba.co.uk|accessdate=10 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Final's Day was played at Rugby Thornfield with [[Kirby Bedon]] of [[Norfolk]] beating [[Warren Heath]] of [[Essex]] in the final. In 2010, Donnington of [[Cambridgeshire]] were the winners followed by Bob Carter of Norfolk in 2011. In 2012, the title was won by a side outside [[East Anglia]] for the first time when [[Cheshire|Cheshire's]] [[Morley Green]] lifted the title. The latest figures show 18,337 ESMBA registered members for the 2016/17 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English Short Mat Bowling Association County Membership Totals|url=http://www.esmba.co.uk/admin/county-membership-totals/|website=www.esmba.co.uk|accessdate=10 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESMBA rules of the game are followed by the affiliated clubs and also by most others. Most clubs arrange competitions among their own members as well as allowing time for those not wishing to take part in competitions to enjoy informal bowling.

==British Isles Championships==
Each year, winners of the national championships of each of the [[home nations]] (Although Ireland are usually represented as one country), along with a team selected by their governing body compete in the British Isles Championships. Despite being open to entry to all competition, the [[Isle of Man]] generally only competes in the singles competition. The winner is traditionally decided in a [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format, with the winner being the team with the most points, and shot difference.

The team competition for the British Isles championship is sixteen against sixteen; known as rinks. Each team deploys four teams of four over four mats, and the winning team is the one with the most combined shots over every mat. Although traditionally frowned upon, it is possible for players in the 'individual' disciplines, to also play in the team event. In this way, it is possible for players to win two British Isles titles in one season.

==World Short Mat Bowls Championships==
The Short Mat World Championships is held every two years in one of its member states. Whilst this may usually be inside the United Kingdom, teams such as [[India]] and [[Italy]] also compete; and thus could host the championships. Unlike the British Isles championships above, the world championships allows nations to enter up to two teams to each discipline; as there is no team event. There is also a knockout system in place after the first round-robin round. These tournaments are run by a group known as the World Short Mat Bowls Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.short-mat-bowls.com/|first=Bob|last=Weaver|title=Short Mat Bowls|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Short Mat Open ==
The International Open was the biggest open competition in Short Mat Bowls when it first started in 2010. The competition was organised by Craig Burgess and Barry Hedges of Essex; both of the trophies awarded are in memory of their fathers, John Burgess and David Hedges. The inaugural event was held at Kempston Indoor Bowls Club, [[Bedford]], England, and had the biggest gathering of short mat bowls talent from all over Europe including England, Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Belgium and Sweden. In subsequent years, the John Burgess Trophy became a pairs event instead of the original triples format. The event finished in 2013.

Teams are made up of two teams from each discipline (Singles, pairs, triples &amp; fours).

'''Sports marketing''' is a subdivision of [[marketing]] which focuses both on the promotion of sports events and teams as well as the promotion of other products and services through sporting events and sports teams. It is a service in which the element promoted can be a physical product or a brand name. The goal is to provide the client with strategies to promote sports or to promote some other product, service, business or cause through sports. Sports marketing is also designed to meet the needs and wants of the consumers through exchange processes.&lt;ref name="Administración de Servicios"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lovelock|first1= Christopher|editor1-first=Christopher |editor1-last= Lovelock |last2= Reynoso|first2= Javier|editor2-first= Javier |editor2-last= Reynoso|last3= D'Andrea|first3= Guillermo|editor3-first=Guillermo|editor3-last= D'Andrea |last4= Huete|first4= Luis|editor4-first= Luis |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last= Huete|title= Administración de Servicios |trans-title= Service's Administration |url= |accessdate=  |volume= |year= 2004 |month= |publisher= Pearson Educación Times |location= |language= spanish |isbn=978-0-273-68826-6|page= |pages= 760|trans-chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies follow the traditional four "P"'s of general [[marketing]] Product, Price, Promotion and Place; another four "P"’s are added to sports marketing, relating to the fact sports are considered to be a service. The additional 4 P’s are: Planning, Packaging, Positioning and Perception. The addition of the four extra elements is called the "sports [[marketing mix]]."&lt;ref name="The Marketing of Sport"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Beech|first1= John|editor1-first=John |editor1-last= Beech |last2= Chadwick|first2= Simon|editor2-first= Simon |editor2-last= Chadwick|title= The marketing of Sport |trans-title= |url= |accessdate=  |volume= |year= 2006 |month= |publisher= Prentice Hall and Financial Times |location= |isbn=978-0-273-68826-6|page= |pages= 592|trans-chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports marketing is an element of sports promotion which involves a wide variety of sectors of the [[sports industry]], including [[sports broadcasting|broadcasting]], advertising, social media, digital platforms, ticket sales, and community relations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sport Marketing, 4th Edition|last = Mullin, B. J., Hardy, S., &amp; Sutton, W.|publisher = Human Kinetics|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports marketing is divided into three sectors. The first is the advertising of sport and sports associations such as the Olympics, Spanish Football league and the NFL, as well as sport teams like Real Madrid and the New York Yankees. The second concerns the use of sporting events, sporting teams and individual athletes to promote various products. The third category is the promotion of sports to the public in order to increase participation.

In the first case, the promotion is directly related to sports. In the second case, the products can but do not have to be directly related to sports. When the promotion is about sports in general, the use of this kind of strategy is called “Marketing of Sports.” When the promotion is not about the sports but sports events, athletes, teams or leagues are used to promote different products, the marketing strategy is denominated “Marketing through sports."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sport marketing: Managing the exchange process|last = Milne, G. R., &amp; McDonald, M. A.|publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the promotion is about increasing participation among the public, it is called "Grassroots Sports Marketing."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To promote the products or services, the companies and associations use different channels such as sponsorships of teams or athletes, television or radio advertisement during the different broadcast sports events and celebrations, and/or advertisement on sporting venues.

“Street marketing of sports” considers sports marketing through billboards on the street and also through urban elements (street lighters and sidewalks, etc.) to help promote and gain publicity during major worldwide sporting events such as the Football World Cup, the Olympic Games, or the Super Bowl.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Like all business sectors, sports businesses also rely on market segmentation to effectively market themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Recreational soccer participants as potential consumers of professional soccer games – Segmenting based on general characteristics|author1=Tokuyama, S. |author2=Greenhalgh, G. |date = 2014|journal = Journal of Contemporary Athletics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sport fans differ according to a number of attributes including motivations to attend sporting events,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Motivational profiles of sport fans of different sports|last = Wann, D.

Attributes such as loyalty can be recognized through the contracts players and athletes sign with sports companies in which they get paid to wear or use their products in each game or sporting event. By doing so, the players and athletes and also their fans develop a loyalty for the products for a longer time.&lt;ref name="The Marketing of Sport" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lynn R.

== Types of sports ==
With such an array of differences of sports fans, different types and levels of sports are found across the globe. For example, in many countries cricket and football are extremely popular while in the United States American football, baseball, and basketball are most favored&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.economist.com/blogs/gametheory/2011/09/ranking-sports%E2%80%99-popularity|title = And the silver goes to ...|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; while college sports are also preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bbcamerica.com/shows/blog/2014/03/americas-big-business-college-football-alien-concept-brits|title = America’s big business of college football? It’s a foreign concept for Brits|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the classification of sports by levels, sports have also been classified as either mainstream or non-mainstream, also known as niche.

There are seven product attributes that differentiate mainstream sports from non-mainstream sports: accessibility, popularity, uniqueness, affordability, star power, player skill, and player similarity. Accessibility, affordability, and similarity are strongly related to niche sports while popularity, player skill as well as accessibility are strongly related to mainstream sports.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Spectator support: Examining the attributes that differentiate niche from mainstream sports|last = Greenhalgh, G. P., Simmons, J. M., Hambrick, M. E., &amp; Greenwell, T. C.|date = 2011|journal = Sport Marketing Quarterly|volume=20 |issue=1 |pages= 41–52|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, fans that are less-identified with a team are drawn to player similarity as they feel they can relate more with players while highly identified fans prefer the star power of players. Affordability also is a distinguishing factor among fans, as less-identified fans place greater importance on price.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Consumption of niche sports: Understanding which product attributes predict consumption across different levels of team identification|last = Simmons, J.

This is also seen in media as nationally televised sporting events often promote specific players leading up to games.

Fans also hold different expectations of different sport types and levels of sports, which is essential for sport marketers to understand. For example, fans attending a minor league baseball game will compare their experience to previous games attended at minor league baseball games, or even other minor league sports if they have little experience with minor league baseball. They will not, however, compare a minor league baseball experience to an NFL game as they understand the two experiences will be very different.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Understanding Spectator Expectations: An analysis of niche sports|last = Greenwell, T.

Sports differentiation is also important concerning sponsorship. Companies who sponsor niche sports place the most importance on attributes including cost effectiveness, spectator demographics, and the company fit with the sports image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Professional niche sports sponsorship: An investigation of sponsorship selection criteria|last = Greenhalgh, G.

Also, with niche sports shown to attract a different type of consumer,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; these companies desire to increase their public awareness within a specific target market.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = What's in it for me?

C.|date = 2013|journal = Sport Marketing Quarterly|volume=22 |issue=2 |pages= 101–112|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other attributes important to companies sponsoring niche sports are enhancing both their image and community involvement,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which may be easier to do through niche sports than mainstream sports.

==Benefits of sports marketing==
[[File:NASCARfender.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Stickers on a NASCAR race car from companies with large advertising contracts.]]
The benefits of sports marketing are wide-ranging. Stakeholders involved in sports include leagues, teams, athletes, and fans as well as cities and countries hosting sporting events. The media and businesses who promote their products and services through sports also receive benefits. Direct benefits to leagues, teams, and athletes include revenue from tickets, media rights, and sponsorships. Cities and countries also receive revenue from taxes, and all of the stakeholders gain from the exposure provided through sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = What is the sports product and who buys it?

==New challenges for sports marketing==
With millennials switching to new platforms to access sport, the role of traditional media and sports marketing is changing. Outmoded inflexible contracts can leave little budget for the all-important activation, and with fans choosing rival unofficial channels for gossip and insider information, the rewards can be hard won. New and accessible ways to view sports, from mobile to social to VR, means there is less incentive for fans to attend events in person, while more expectation is placed on sports stars to pull off an authentic natural voice for their brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/need-know-sports-marketing-2017-beyond/1424873#mainchallenges|title=What you need to know about sports marketing in 2017 and beyond|author=|date=|website=campaignlive.co.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environment is extremely tough for small college athletics (e.g., NCAA Division III schools), who rely on fan attendance for revenue generation to keep their sports afloat - requiring communicators and marketers to become more creative in the ways they promote sports to their target audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|date=2016-09-01|title=Attitudes and Motivations of Students Toward Athletic-Event Attendance at a Midsize Division III University: Recommendations for Communicators|url=http://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/10.1123/ijsc.2016-0011|journal=International Journal of Sport Communication|volume=9|issue=3|pages=321–339|doi=10.1123/ijsc.2016-0011|issn=1936-3915}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==The marketing of sports teams and events==
According to different authors and organizations, the marketing of sports events and teams is defined as “Designing or developing a 'live' themed activity, occasion, display, or exhibit a sporting event to promote a product, a team, cause, or organization. In other words it can be defined as follows: The marketing of sports events and teams is the marketing strategy which is designed or developed for a “live” activity, which has a specific theme. Mostly this kind of strategy is used as a way to promote, display or exhibit different things, such as a sports team, a sport association among others. There are different events that can clearly exemplify this concept, such as the [[Super Bowl]], the [[Olympic Games]], the [[UEFA Champions League]], the [[World Marathon Majors]], and the [[FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name="Definition marketing of sport event"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/event-marketing.html |title=Event marketing |author=Business dictionary.com |date=5 November 2010 |publisher=Bisnessdictionary.com |trans-title= Definicion de marketing de un evento |accessdate= November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major sports brands compete to link up with the best marathons in the world, the test for excellence in ‘running’, in what is a genuine showcase for strengthening its [[marketing strategy]] to its target audience. [[Adidas]]''',''' [[ASICS|Asics]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] are dividing the market into the ‘[[World Marathon Majors]]'''’''', the international athletics competition created in 2006 that brings together the most prestigious [[marathon]]s on the planet. They are not title but technical sponsors, but these runs are popular and are not to be missed events for these brands, which create specific [[advertising campaign]]s to one of the few competitions that brings together professionals and amateurs under the same chrono.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://johancruyffinstitute.com/en/blog-en/nothing-is-impossible-in-sports-marketing/|title=Nothing is impossible in sports marketing|date=|website=|publisher=Johan Cruyff Institute|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Super Bowl is an example of this concept because it is a massive sports event organized by a sport association, the NFL, which looks to promote the event, the sport, and as well the different football teams. The event is promoted through local and national media, and has also spread internationally. For example, in Mexico the NFL signed a contract with [[Cinemex]], a Mexican movie theater chain, for the right to transmit its games in movie theaters. This displays the potential of sporting leagues and teams to promote not just the event, but the league and teams involved to a worldwide audience.&lt;ref name="NFL and Cinemex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.luismaram.com/2006/09/07/la-nfl-en-cinemex/ |title=La NFL en Cinemex |author=Luis Maram |date=7 September 2010|publisher= Luis Maram|language=Spanish |trans-title= The NFL in Cinemex |accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The marketing of products through sports==
''''Marketing through sports'''' is a concept  that's been used since the 1980s, but has increased in importance in the last two decades due to the growth and expansion that the different types of sports have enjoyed since then.
“Marketing through sports” it is a marketing strategy that can be used in sports in two different ways. First, the use of marketing and promotion can be carried out through the sport or through the sports club. In the first case, the use of marketing is under responsibility of the different sporting associations, while in the second case, the responsibility falls on the different sports clubs.
In this manner, marketing and promotion through sports and through the club involve sponsorship, corporate events and boxes, licensed merchandise, names and images also known as “endorsement”, advertising through broadcaster, advertising such as advertising as ground signage/clothing/equipment advertising, promoting games, promoting using players/club/league or developing ‘business opportunities.’
The peculiarity of sports is that “sports is the only entertainment where, no matter how many times you go back, you never know the ending.” This singular fact is used by marketing companies as an advantage: every time the audience attends an event it will see the advertisements again and again, providing a wide range of opportunities for the different companies which operate in this field.&lt;ref name="The Marketing of Sport"/&gt;

===Examples of marketing of products through sports===

==== Sponsorship of events ====
One of the oldest examples of the marketing of products through sports is [[Slazenger|Slazenger’s]] supplying of the official ball of Wimbledon (1902- 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.slazenger.com/CustomerServices/OtherInformation/AboutUs|title=About Us - Slazenger|author=|date=|website=store.slazenger.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).Another international example of marketing products through sport is Adidas’ sponsorship of FIFA, which includes the company supplying the balls used in the World Cup and having its logo on the side boards along the play-field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://qz.com/233611/adidas-won-the-world-cup-battle-but-nike-is-winning-the-soccer-wars/|title = Adidas won the World Cup battle, but Nike is winning the soccer wars|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In what it described as a "world first" in corporate sports sponsorship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/events/boatrace.jsp|title=BNY Mellon &amp; Newton Pull Together for Cancer Research UK|author=|date=|website=bnymellon.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016 [[BNY Mellon]] and [[Newton Investment Management]] announced they had donated their title sponsorship of the annual Oxford and Cambridge [[The Boat Race|Boat Races]] to [[Cancer Research UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bnymellon.com/emea/en/_locale-assets/pdf/who-we-are/bny-mellon-newton-pull-together-for-cancer-research-uk.pdf|title=BNY Mellon and Cancer Research UK Boat Race sponsorship details|author=|date=|website=bnymellon.com|accessdate=19 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404093455/https://www.bnymellon.com/emea/en/_locale-assets/pdf/who-we-are/bny-mellon-newton-pull-together-for-cancer-research-uk.pdf|archivedate=4 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sponsorship of teams====
Sponsorship of teams is found throughout sports. Some of the most visible examples are found in the MLS as company names and logos are featured on team jerseys. For example, Alaska Airlines is the official jersey sponsor of the Portland Timbers while Valspar is the official sponsor of the Chicago Fire. These are examples of sponsorships of companies that are not related to sports.

Turkish Airlines established a sports marketing strategy involving high-profile sports teams, players, and sport associations including Manchester United, FC Barcelona, the Euroleague basketball competition, NBA player Kobe Bryant, the Turkey national football team, and tennis player Caroline Wozniacki.

Another example of sports marketing through sponsorships of teams is the apparel contracts seen throughout sports. In 2011 Nike agreed to become the official apparel company of the NFL in exchange for around $220 million per year, a deal that has been extended through 2019.

At the college level, Ohio State and Nike maintain a contract that provides the school a value of $16.8 million per year in cash and product through the 2033-34 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-reaches-252-million-deal-to-extend-sponsorship-at-ohio-state-1452811305|title = Nike reaches $252 million deal to extend sponsorship at Ohio State|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michigan meanwhile receives a total value of $15.3 million per year. Under Armour and Adidas are also major apparel brands as Under Armour sponsors Notre Dame for $9 million per year while Adidas provides more than $7 million each year to both UCLA and Louisville.

These are examples of sports marketing because as it is defined, sports marketing is a marketing strategy in which companies related to sports products or services promote their trademark through design, production or other resources. In this case apparel companies Nike, Under Armour, and Adidas, which are all completely related to sports, design the uniforms of these teams and in this way, promote their trademarks every time there is an event.

==== Sponsorship of athletes ====
Apparel companies also sponsor professional athletes such as [[Kevin Durant]] who receives $30 million per year from Nike. [[Stephen Curry]] is speculated to receive even more money than Durant from his contract with Under Armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.basketballinsiders.com/nba-pm-largest-nba-shoe-deals/|title = NBA PM: Largest NBA shoe deals|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Puma pays sprinter Usain Bolt $10 million per year.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://opendorse.com/blog/highest-paid-athlete-endorsers/|title = Top 100 highest-paid athlete endorsers of 2015|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many athletes maintain contracts with a variety of companies; some of them are related to sports and others that are not. Roger Federer holds agreements with Nike, Wilson, Rolex, Mercedes-Benz, and Gillette, worth a sum close to $60 million each year. LeBron James’ contracts with Nike, Beats by Dre, Coca-Cola, Kia, McDonald’s, and Samsung accrue the NBA player more than $40 million per year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Peyton Manning meanwhile holds sponsorship agreements with companies including Buick, DirecTV, Gatorade, Nationwide and Papa John’s worth in sum approximately $12 million per year. Fellow NFL quarterback Drew Brees earns $11 million each year from his contracts with Wrangler, Vicks, Verizon, Nike, and Microsoft.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another example of marketing through sports is the strategy used by Gillette to promote its personal hygiene products through representative figures of each sport on television during broadcast sports events. Gillette uses athletes such as tennis player Roger Federer, golfer Tiger Woods, and soccer player Thierry Henry. In the commercial these celebrities appear using the products of the company. This is done in order to promote these products to the fans of these celebrities and inspire them to use these products. It is a clear example of this concept, because the company using this marketing strategy is not related to sports at all, but through important sports personalities, its products are exposed to a larger target audience.

Nike and Gatorade also hold sponsorship agreements with top athletes. Included among Nike's clients are Federer, Woods, golfer Rory McIlroy and tennis player Rafael Nadal while Gatorade has deals with NBA star Dwyane Wade, Serena Williams, and Peyton and Eli Manning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== The promotion of sports to the public to increase sports participation ==
Grassroots sports marketing is a part of the field of marketing known as social marketing. This refers to marketing something that is of benefit to the public, and is normally done by government or charities rather than private sector organizations. It is normally done with a much smaller budget than marketing of sports teams and event or marketing of products through sports as it does not bring any direct financial benefit. Although this marketing normally drives people to clubs where they will pay to play sports, it still needs to be subsidized in order to be run. The money therefore comes from local councils with a remit to increase participation or from public health sector which wants to decrease the cost of healthcare.

Examples of the promotion of sports to increase participation is the United States Golf Association’s initiatives to increase golf participation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thefieldsofgreen.com/2014/07/23/to-increase-participation-usga-promotes-nine-hole-golf/|title = To increase participation, USGA promotes nine-hole golf|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as MLB’s One Baseball campaign, which attempts to unify baseball organizations at all levels with the overarching goal of increasing youth participation and consequently creating new fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/03/23/In-Depth/One-Baseball.aspx|title = MLB pushes for united front to boost baseball|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship Marketing in Sports ==
[[Relationship marketing]] relates to customer retention and building long term successful relationship between a business and its customers by maximizing customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kotler|first1=P|title=The view from here. In Peppers. D., &amp; Rogers, M. (Eds.), Managing customer relationships: A strategic framework|date=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sport businesses need to communicate and participate in discussion with their customers in order to create, sustain and improve relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheth|first1=Jagdish N.|title=The future of relationship marketing|journal=Journal of Services Marketing|date=December 2002|volume=16|issue=7|pages=590–592|doi=10.1108/08876040210447324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing studies offer insightful information into relationship marketing and the general consensus is that sports businesses can benefit from its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=K|last2=Trail|first2=G|title=A conceptual framework for understanding relationships between sport consumers and sport organizations: A relationship quality approach|journal=Journal of Sport Management|date=2011|volume=25|issue=1|pages=57–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many situations, sports marketing affairs include some sort of relationship marketing, where clubs, organisations, fans and athletes have relationships with one another that are dependent on the successful management of those relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bee|first1=C|last2=Khale|first2=R|title=Relationship marketing in sports: A functional approach|journal=Sport Marketing Quarterly|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2|pages=102–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for sport businesses to be successful in their goals, they should view their customers as partners for life rather than here and now consumers, and attempt to understand their ever-evolving needs, desires, expectations and values. By doing so, sport businesses are able to maintain and enhance their fan base easily than through the more commonly used short-term transactions such as merchandise and ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abeza|first1=G|last2=O'Reilly|first2=N|last3=Reid|first3=I|title=Relationship Marketing and Social Media in Sport’|journal=International Journal of Sport Communication|date=2013|volume=6|issue=2|pages=120–142|doi=10.1123/ijsc.6.2.120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media enables businesses to do this and connect with their customers with much higher efficiency and effectiveness.

== Social Media and relationship marketing in sports ==
Used as a global communication and interaction channel, social media has changed the conventional business customer relationship dynamics. Social media  is a tool that enables customers’ engagement through an instantaneous and active back-to-back conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drury|first1=Glen|title=Opinion piece: Social media: Should marketers engage and how can it be done effectively?|journal=Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice|date=4 January 2008|volume=9|issue=3|pages=274–277|doi=10.1057/palgrave.dddmp.4350096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers are increasingly incorporating social media into their daily lives and using it for communication. Businesses have also made it an integral part of their communication mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mangold|first1=C|last2=Faulds|first2=D|title=Social media: The new hybrid element of the promotion mix|journal=Business Horizons|date=2009|volume=52|issue=4|pages=357–365|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2009.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, sports businesses can use social media to actively listen to their customers, recognise and follow their specific needs and wants &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=J|last2=Chinn|first2=S.J.|title=Meeting relationship-marketing goals through social media: A conceptual model for sport marketers|journal=International Journal of Sport Communication|date=2010|volume=3|issue=4|pages=422–437|doi=10.1123/ijsc.3.4.422}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than use out-dated methods of data collection such as surveys and focus groups, which do not provide rich information to better understand customers. It allows sports businesses to keep their customers updated on the latest news and information as well as interact with them on an individual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Askool|first1=S,|last2=Nakata|first2=K,|title=A conceptual model for acceptance of social CRM systems based on a scoping study|journal=AI &amp; Society|date=2011|volume=26|issue=3|pages=205–220|doi=10.1007/s00146-010-0311-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This instantaneous two-way communication tool available to sports businesses allows them to provide quality content within short time frames and interact with customers in real time. In terms of marketing, this can also be seen as a form of competitive advantage. They are able to interact the way they want, in the way they wish, using the medium they like most. This gives sports businesses additional edge in terms of marketing. Effective utilization of social media enables sports brands to provide their customers with the best possible experience and expand their marketing capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woodcock|first1=N|last2=Broomfield|first2=N|last3=Downer|first3=G|last4=Starkey|first4=M|title=The evolving data architecture of social customer relationship management|journal=Journal of Direct Data and Digital Marketing Practice|date=2011|volume=12|issue=3|pages=249–266|doi=10.1057/dddmp.2010.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits of social media are for both sides. Apart from sports businesses benefiting from the use of social media in the context of relationship management and marketing, customers also get to experience the same level of benefits. The constant interaction between sport businesses and their customers allows organisations to know and learn about each individual customer on a deeper level. As a result of this, customers feel more valued and this leads to higher customer loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peppers|first1=D|last2=Roggers|first2=M|title=Managing customer relationships: A strategic framework|date=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media enables sport businesses to involve customers in the marketing process by receiving feedback and ideas, which can then be implemented in future products and services. By doing so, sport businesses strengthen the level of engagement and connection between the organisation and the customer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=R|last2=Rogers|first2=M|title=Social media and its implications for viral marketing|journal=Asia Pacific Public Relations Journal|date=2010|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this reinforces the importance that customers hold in the brand building process.

== Sports marketing through social media ==
Professional leagues, teams, and athletes have started using social media as a part of their marketing strategies during the recent years. The most popular social media platforms are Facebook and Twitter, but athletes and teams are also using sites including Instagram and Snapchat for marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2014/07/28/8-lessons-from-sports-marketing-experts-for-brands-and-athletes-resisting-move-to-digital/#2715e4857a0b140cf25b6409|title = 8 lessons from sports marketing experts for brands and athletes resisting move to digital|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.venustrappedinmars.com/2015/11/athlete-pro-sports-teams-snapchat.html|title = The complete list of your favorite pro teams' Snapchat handles|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in case of all businesses, the advantages of social media use in sports include building brand awareness, reaching a larger audience in an easy and cost-effective way&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.socialmediaelearning.co.uk/6-advantages-of-social-media-marketing/|title = 6 advantages of using social media marketing for your business|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as creating brand advocates and engaging passionate sports fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.adweek.com/sa-article/passion-fan-146722|title = The passion of the fan: Consumers want more from their sports brands...more digital content, more entertainment, more fun|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous examples of athletes and sports teams using social media for marketing and promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://socialnsport.com/|title = Strong #SMSports examples of Twitter polls|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, for a brand like [[Babolat]], having a world icon like [[Rafael Nadal]] as its top brand representative is priceless. There is no better way to stand up to your competition than by having the best on your side. You must also know how to do it because not everything works in marketing. This is why knowing how to use social media is fundamentally important. “A message on Twitter is not just an advertising channel with which you can win an audience. Its power lies in the message being relevant and credible”,  explains Edwin Schravesande (professor of [[e-marketing]] at the [https://cruyffacademy.nl Johan Cruyff Academy] of Tilburg).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://johancruyffinstitute.com/en/blog-en/the-athlete-as-a-social-media-marketing-product/|title = The athlete as a social media marketing product|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = Johan Cruyff Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baylor Bold Rewards Program: When fans decide to "Like" or "Follow" Baylor athletics on either Twitter or Facebook, they are given day-to-day updates on their favorite teams. From a marketing aspect, the Baylor athletics page on Facebook and Twitter (@BaylorAthletics) keeps track of fans who have "tweeted" or "commented" on certain links, posts, or tweets. There is an incentive for these fans to post and tweet because at the end of each year, the top three posting or tweeting fans are selected to receive grand prizes including free jerseys and merchandise to season tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.baylorbears.com/genrel/111011aad.html|title = Baylor athletics unveils social media rewards program|date = |access-date = |website = Baylor Bears|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michigan Presale Incentive: Michigan used a very clever way to increase the total amount of "likes" or "followers" for their Facebook and Twitter Pages in order to find higher recognition. In order to have the opportunity to apply for pre-sale tickets for their Michigan football games, at the largest football arena in the nation 'The Big House,' fans are required to "follow" or "like" their page on Facebook or Twitter. This allows them to be able to purchase pre-sale tickets for any game that they desire, making this method of marketing a great tool for gaining awareness for their team and many other things.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Louisville Slugger Scavenger Hunt: After the St. Louis Cardinals won the World Series in 2011, Hillerich &amp; Bradsby, makers of Louisville Slugger bats and other baseball equipment, created a scavenger hunt through Twitter in order to raise awareness for their company. The hunt involved 45 world series commemorative bats, scattered all over the city of St. Louis, Missouri. The Louisville Slugger Twitter page posted "tweets" that hinted at where the bats were located within the city. The fan or participants used their mobile phones in order to remain up to date on the specific "tweets" referring to the hunt. If a fan or participant found one of the several bats, the participant was told that they were to be kept by the seeker. The reason this company held a scavenger hunt was to find recognition and to increase their number of followers on Twitter. The statistics shows that their fan base skyrocketed, lifting the number of Facebook likes by 143%, number of people talking about the brand on Facebook by 834% and its number of Tweeter followers by 161%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.clickz.com/louisville-slugger-lifts-facebook-chatter-by-834/49051/|title = Louisville Slugger Lifts Facebook Chatter by 834%|date = |access-date = |website = Clickz|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many teams have incorporated sponsorships into their social media strategies, such as the Minnesota Vikings “Touchdown Tracker” Instagram image, which was sponsored by FedEx. The Cleveland Browns also displayed sponsorship integration in their tweets recapping touchdown drives, sponsored by Cooper Tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://socialnsport.com/2015/10/|title = 5 guidelines for sponsored social content|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many athletes including Kobe Bryant, Russell Wilson, and Rafael Nadal have taken advantage of social media to increase their followers and improve their brand recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blog.hootsuite.com/top-athletes-social-media/|title = Six top athletes using social media to dominate|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes have also promoted brands through social media including Russell Wilson’s sponsorship of Recovery Water and Serena Williams’ promotion of Wheels Up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sesponsorshipgroup.com/sponsorship-figures/2015/9/15/a-sponsored-tweet-from-lebron-james-valued-at-140000|title = A sponsored tweet from LeBron James valued at $140,000|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this marketing tool, these fan-based website pages have increased greatly in numbers and give them the recognition that they were looking for.

The '''Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris''', also known as the '''Marassi''' from the name of the neighbourhood where it is located, is a multi-use stadium in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]]. The home of [[Genoa C.F.C.]] and [[U.C. Sampdoria]] football clubs, it opened in 1911 and is one of the oldest stadiums still in use for football and other sports in Italy. Aside from football, the stadium has hosted meetings of rugby in the [[Italian National Rugby Team|Italian national team]] and, more rarely, some concerts.

==Notable matches==
The stadium was inaugurated on 22 January 1911 with a football match between Genoa and [[Internazionale]], and had a capacity of 20,000. On 22 December 1912, it hosted its first international, in which [[Italy national football team|Italy]] lost 3–1 to [[Austria national football team|Austria]] in a friendly.&lt;ref name=euf&gt;http://eu-football.info/_venue.php?id=546&lt;/ref&gt;

It also hosted the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934 World Cup]] quarter-final match between [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]],&lt;ref name=euf/&gt; and by then its capacity had been expanded to 30,000.

The stadium was dismantled and rebuilt before the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], for which it hosted three Group C matches (between [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]) and a round-of-16 match between the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Romania national football team|Romania]].

The highest attendance at the Luigi Ferraris was 60,000 on 27 February 1949, for a match between [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]].

On 12 October 2010, a [[Euro 2012]] [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group C|qualifier]] between [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] was abandoned after Serbia fans continued to throw flares onto the pitch and light fireworks. When the game finally began, more flares and fireworks were thrown onto the field and the referee stopped the match after only six minutes of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/9086046.stm|title=Italy-Serbia Euro 2012 tie abandoned after fan trouble |date=12 October 2010|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 February 2012, the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] defeated Italy 1–0 in a friendly played at the stadium. It was the first time that Italy had been defeated in Genoa and the first time that the US had ever defeated Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.ussoccer.com/news/mens-national-team/2012/02/us-mnt-earns-first-win-against-italy.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111164345/http://m.ussoccer.com/News/Mens-National-Team/2012/02/US-MNT-Earns-First-Win-Against-Italy.aspx |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2014, it hosted [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy’s]] end-of-year rugby union international against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] who won 20 - 18.

'''Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium''' ({{zh|t=臺中市洲際棒球場}}) is a stadium in [[Beitun District]], [[Taichung]], [[Taiwan]]. The stadium officially opened on November 9, 2006 replacing the antiquated [[Taichung Baseball Field]]. Located on the corner of Chongde Road (崇德路) and Huanzhong Road (環中路), it has considerably more parking available than the old stadium, which will be much more convenient for fans.

The stadium is a venue for [[rock concert]]s and also hosted [[Zhang Yimou]]'s [[Turandot at the Forbidden City|Turandot at the Bird's Nest]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;张艺谋版《图兰朵》台湾上演_中国台湾网 2010年12月17日 "大型景观歌剧《图兰朵》在台中市洲际棒球场上演。 当晚，张艺谋以总导演 身份观看了演出。此次赴台演出的制作团队仍为“鸟巢版”《图兰朵》&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Construction on the stadium began in 2005 and is operating on the [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] (BOT) model that is becoming increasingly common among [[public works]] projects in Taiwan. The first phase includes 15,000 infield seats, all with seatback chairs. After the second phase was completed in 2008, [[seating capacity]] was expanded to 20,000 by adding 5,000 outfield seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://veestadium.markwell.com.tw/?cat=20 |title=台中市洲際棒球場簡介(Introduction of Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium) |publisher=Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium |language=Chinese |date=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major events==
The first major event hosted by the new stadium was the [[2006 Intercontinental Cup]], a baseball competition between eight nations from four different continents. [[Korea national baseball team|South Korea]] defeated [[Philippines national baseball team|the Philippines]] in the opener 10–0, followed by [[Chinese Taipei national baseball team|Chinese Taipei]]'s defeat against [[Italy national baseball team|Italy]] 3–13 on November 9.{{ref|bb1}}

On the final day of the [[2006 Intercontinental Cup]] it was announced that the [[2007 Baseball World Cup]] will be held in Taichung, with this stadium one of the two to be used for the tournament. The stadium also hosted some games at the [[2007 Asian Baseball Championship]], which counted as the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] qualifier for the Asia region.

The stadium hosted the Pool B in the first round of the [[2013 World Baseball Classic]].

==Name confusion==
From the beginning of this project, the stadium had been known as the Taichung International Standard Baseball Stadium.{{ref|name1}}  However, newspaper reports had referred to it as the Taichung International Baseball Stadium, (dropping the word "Standard".){{ref|name2}}  A Chinese language schedule for the [[2006 Intercontinental Cup]] had identified the stadium as the Taichung Intercontinental Stadium.

According to a report in 2006, the mayor of [[Taichung]], [[Jason Hu]], announced that the name of the stadium has been officially designated as Intercontinental Baseball Stadium. This is in honor of the event being the first to be held at the stadium.{{ref|name3}}

'''Tiger Stadium&lt;ref&gt;http://www.texasbob.com/stadium/stadium.php?id=1042&lt;/ref&gt;''' is a 10,001-capacity high school and junior collegiate [[American football]], [[track and field]] and [[soccer]] stadium adjacent to Corsicana High School in [[Corsicana, Texas]]. It is the current home of the Corsicana Tigers football, track and field, and soccer teams,  the [[Navarro College]] Bulldogs football team, and the [[Corsicana Bowl]], a [[NCAA Division II]] College Football [[Bowl Game]].

==History==
The sports complex began its history as part of a larger $44.5 million bond project that was passed in 2004 to enlarge the high school, renovate and expand [[Corsicana Independent School District|Collins Middle School]] and improve facilities for sports and other extracurricular activities at both schools. Tiger Stadium sits on about {{convert|30|acre|m2}} of a {{convert|116|acre|km2|adj=on}} site bought by the [[Corsicana Independent School District]] in 2004 in anticipation of the new stadium. Tiger Stadium replaces Tiger Field, which opened in 1961, as the home for the Corsicana Tigers and Navarro College Bulldogs.
The stadium has not only hosted games for the main tenants, but has also recently been used as a neutral site along with other newer high school, collegiate and professional stadiums in [[Texas]] in the [[University Interscholastic League|University Interscholastic League's]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corsicanadailysun.com/archivesearch/local_story_318033544.html&lt;/ref&gt; annual Texas State Football Playoffs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21373">[[File:Lord Hawke - Vanity Fair-alt-edit-2-cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Lord Hawke in his playing days. He was a key figure in the captaincy debate.|alt=Painting of a cricketer.]]
The '''Yorkshire captaincy affair of 1927''' arose from a disagreement among members of [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]] over the selection of a new captain to succeed the retired Major [[Arthur Lupton]]. The main issue was whether a professional [[cricket]]er should be appointed to the post. It was a tradition throughout English county cricket that captains should always be [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|amateurs]]. At Yorkshire, a succession of amateur captains held office in the 1920s, on the grounds of their supposed leadership qualities, although they were not worth their place in the team as cricketers. None lasted long; after Lupton's departure some members felt it was time to appoint a more accomplished cricketer on a long-term basis.

The Yorkshire committee, prompted by the influential county president, [[Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke|Lord Hawke]], approached [[Herbert Sutcliffe]], one of the side's leading professionals. After Sutcliffe's provisional acceptance of the captaincy, controversy arose. Some members objected to the appointment on the traditional grounds that Sutcliffe was not an amateur; others felt that if a professional was to be appointed, the post should be offered to the county's senior professional, [[Wilfred Rhodes]], who had been playing much longer than Sutcliffe.  Rhodes himself was offended that he had not been approached. When Sutcliffe became aware of the controversy, he withdrew his acceptance. No offer was made to Rhodes, and the county subsequently appointed amateur [[William Worsley]] as captain. He was respected by the team but had little personal success, lasted for just two seasons, and was followed by two further short-term leaders. In 1933 [[Brian Sellers]], a more competent amateur, was appointed and became the long-serving captain that Yorkshire had sought.

==Background==
[[File:Wilfred Rhodes 1920.tiff|thumb|upright|Leading Yorkshire cricketer [[Wilfred Rhodes]], in 1920: Rhodes was a possible successor to Major Lupton as captain, and the favoured choice of many members.|alt=A close up of a man in an MCC cap]]
In the 1920s, every English county cricket team had an amateur captain.&lt;ref name=SW397&gt;Swanton and Woodcock, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] had been led by amateurs since [[Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke|Lord Hawke]] took over the position in 1883.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Prior to 1883, Yorkshire had been led by professionals since the club's creation  in 1863. See {{Cite book| title = The Yorkshire County Cricket Club Yearbook| edition = 2010| publisher = Great Northern Books| location = Ilkley | chapter = Officials of the Yorkshire County Cricket Club|isbn = 978-1-905080-75-5 | pages = 8, 359–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amateurs were usually from privileged backgrounds, while professionals were mainly from the [[working class]]es. Class distinctions pervaded the game, which was organised and administered by former and current amateurs. They wished to preserve leadership roles for members of [[the Establishment]], in defiance of broader social changes that had reduced their influence in other sports.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pp. 105–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, pp. 175, 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W187&gt;Williams, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Administrators argued that amateurs were better captains as they were free from worries over  employment. The ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' editor believed that "the professional may have difficulty in enforcing discipline. He would naturally hesitate to suggest to his committee that this player or that should be dropped, and so be instrumental in depriving the man in question of some part of his livelihood. Further, feeling that an error of judgment would prejudice his standing with the committee, he might well hesitate to take risks."&lt;ref name=wisden&gt;{{Cite web|last= Caine | first= Stewart | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151713.html| title = Notes by the Editor| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1928| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | accessdate = 21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, Lord Hawke, then the Yorkshire president, expressing his hope that an amateur would always be available to captain the national side, had made the impromptu comment, "Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England."&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks were widely reported in the press and heavily criticised. This was to leave Hawke in an awkward situation in 1927.&lt;ref name=G155&gt;Gibson, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the [[1927 English cricket season]], Yorkshire had had a succession of short-term captains. Generally, these men were neither sufficiently good players nor leaders to merit a position in the team, but Yorkshire's side was strong enough to include them in the interest of maintaining amateur leadership. Tactically, Yorkshire's success came not from the captain but from the influence of leading professionals [[Wilfred Rhodes]] and [[Emmott Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H104&gt;Hill, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The captain's primary role was the enforcement of discipline: maintaining an amicable attitude within the team during games and ensuring that umpires and opponents were respected. In the early 1920s, Yorkshire had been undisciplined on the field; cricket correspondent [[Jim Kilburn]] wrote that they were in danger of becoming "social outcasts",&lt;ref name=H106/&gt; and [[E. W. Swanton]] commented that Yorkshire's hostile attitude when fielding looked likely to jeopardise their relations with other teams.&lt;ref name=H106/&gt; Matters came to a head in a match against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] in 1924 at Sheffield. The crowd became very antagonistic and a [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) enquiry found that a Yorkshire player had incited the unrest. Further incidents against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] that season led the captain [[Geoffrey Wilson (cricketer)|Geoffrey Wilson]] to resign, though he led the team to the [[County Championship]] in each of his three years in charge. His resignation was possibly prompted by the Yorkshire president, Lord Hawke, but Wilson did not like the belligerent nature of the team and found it difficult to handle Rhodes.&lt;ref name=H106&gt;Hill, pp. 106–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yorkshire appointed Major [[Arthur Lupton]] as captain, hoping that his experience in the army would allow him to exercise greater control than his predecessors had managed. Aged 46, he was old for a cricketer. He had played once for Yorkshire in 1908, but was no longer an effective batsman. He was very popular with the players, and managed to improve discipline but had little influence on team tactics.&lt;ref name=H106/&gt;&lt;ref name=W333&gt;Woodhouse, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; He left such matters to Rhodes and Robinson, to the point where several apocryphal stories emerged about his lack of control. In one story, Yorkshire had scored around 400. Lupton, hoping to score some easy runs, came out of the amateur dressing room with his bat when a young professional touched his arm and said, "It's all right, sir. Mr Rhodes has [[declaration and forfeiture|declared]] [the innings over]."&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt; After three years in charge, Lupton resigned the captaincy at the end of 1927.&lt;ref name=W333/&gt; In their search for a successor, Yorkshire hoped to appoint a player with a better cricketing reputation who would serve for a longer term.&lt;ref name=H104/&gt;

==Appointment of Sutcliffe==
[[File:Herbert Sutcliffe.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Herbert Sutcliffe during a practice session at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1924| alt= A cricketer ready to bat.]]

===Initial approach===
At the beginning of the 1927 season, Yorkshire secretary [[Frederick Toone]] approached Wilfred Rhodes to suggest that he should resign from his position as senior professional.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The senior professional of a county side was the professional cricketer who had played for the team the longest. This player often influenced the playing style and tactics of the side.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes declined, prompted by his wife's suspicion of a plot against him. This may have been an attempt by Yorkshire to clear the way for a new captain.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Hawke was in favour of appointing [[Herbert Sutcliffe]],&lt;ref name=G155/&gt; a professional who had opened the batting for Yorkshire since 1919. In addition to Rhodes, other professionals on the side had debuted for Yorkshire earlier than Sutcliffe. However, Sutcliffe was unusual among professionals: he had received a [[Commissioned officer#Commissioned officers|commission]] in the [[British Army]] in the First World War, his appearance was always immaculate and when speaking he altered his accent to fit what he considered a better class of society. Such characteristics were more common among amateur cricketers, and Sutcliffe in many ways behaved like one. While not particularly popular with his teammates, he was respected.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pp. 226–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H105&gt;Hill, pp. 105–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, pp. 155–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawke asked [[Sir Home Gordon, 12th Baronet|Sir Home Gordon]], a cricket writer who had assisted Hawke with his autobiography, to sound out other counties to see if they would find Sutcliffe an acceptable captain if he played as an amateur—some players switched from amateur to professional, or vice versa, around this time.&lt;ref name=G155/&gt; Sutcliffe was en route to South Africa with the MCC touring team, but was aware that Yorkshire were considering him as a replacement for Lupton.&lt;ref name=H105/&gt;

Sutcliffe's election was confirmed at a meeting of the club's governing committee on 2 November 1927, which voted on two proposals sponsored by Hawke.&lt;ref name=G155/&gt;&lt;ref name=H104/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Sutcliffe to Captain Yorkshire| newspaper = The Times  | location = London  | page = 7 | date = 3 November 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, to give Sutcliffe amateur status, was defeated by 19 votes to 5; the second, to appoint him captain, was carried 13–11.&lt;ref name=H110&gt;Hill, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November, a [[Press Association]] correspondent informed Sutcliffe on board his ship that he had been appointed. Sutcliffe replied, "It is the biggest honour of my career&amp;nbsp;... I shall do my utmost to uphold the best traditions of Yorkshire and England cricket."&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; However, six days later, having arrived in Cape Town, he sent a telegram stating, "I have not yet received by mail an official offer from the Yorkshire authorities of the captaincy of the Yorkshire team next season."&lt;ref name=H110/&gt;

===Reaction===
Reports at the time said that Lord Hawke and Toone had denied all knowledge of the approach to Sutcliffe;&lt;ref name=H110/&gt; Hawke said he supported the committee but Home Gordon later recalled that Hawke seemed indecisive about the best course of action. In the opinion of cricket writer [[Alan Gibson]], his predicament came from his earlier criticism of professional captaincy.&lt;ref name=G155/&gt;&lt;ref name=H113&gt;Hill, pp. 113–14.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' said that "Yorkshire cricket circles were greatly perturbed by the announcement".&lt;ref name=wisden/&gt; Most opposition to the appointment was based on objections to the idea of a professional captain.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W351&gt;Woodhouse, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'', several members of the county club wrote to express their opinions. Some claimed it was too great a burden for a professional to captain the team while also earning a living through the game and therefore being concerned with his personal performances. Others said that Yorkshire's amateur leaders were not given enough opportunities to prove themselves before they were replaced.&lt;ref name=H111&gt;Hill, pp. 111–12.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also argued that if a suitable amateur candidate was unavailable and a professional appointment unavoidable, Wilfred Rhodes was the senior professional and longest serving player.&lt;ref name=H110/&gt;&lt;ref name=W351/&gt; Rhodes, drawn into the argument, said that the team would have preferred an amateur captain; he also stated that he had not been approached, which made him feel unappreciated. Other members wrote to support Sutcliffe's selection, glad a professional was openly appointed; they thought the team would be strengthened by the decision.&lt;ref name=H111/&gt; At the beginning of December, one Yorkshire member, S. E. Grimshaw, conducted a poll: 2,264 Yorkshire members were in favour of an amateur captain, while 444 wanted a professional. If an amateur could not be found, 2,007 preferred Rhodes be captain, compared to 876 who supported Sutcliffe.&lt;ref name=H113/&gt;

===Withdrawal of offer===
Following the members' poll, Yorkshire sent a telegram to Sutcliffe in South Africa, asking him to withdraw his acceptance of the captaincy. Sutcliffe replied that he had now considered the offer and was appreciative but had to decline it. When news reached the Yorkshire committee on 18 December, they appointed [[William Worsley]], who had refused the leadership in 1924 due to farming commitments.&lt;ref name=H113/&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt; In the words of ''Wisden'', "Happily the trouble was eventually settled to the satisfaction of all concerned. Sutcliffe declined the honour and, an invitation being extended to Captain Worsley, that gentleman stepped into the breach."&lt;ref name=wisden/&gt; Lord Hawke sent a message which thanked Sutcliffe for "your loyalty to the club".&lt;ref name=H113/&gt; The ''Yorkshire Post'' also paid tribute to Sutcliffe and the way he handled himself, noting that while a conflict of opinion had been inevitable, it was "carried to unreasonable lengths".&lt;ref name=H113/&gt; Commenting on the affair, ''The Times'' expressed regret that Sutcliffe had felt obliged to turn down the leadership; it noted that amateur captains were preferable in reminding people that cricket was only a game, but that there was nothing in principle to prevent a professional from performing the role. Of Sutcliffe, it said, "One would have liked to see him lead the side, and his general popularity, combined with his skill as a batsman, makes it probable that he would have been a success. However, half the value of a captain is gone if, before he takes up his duties, people begin to question whether he is the right man for the position, and Sutcliffe has been well-advised to recognise this fact."&lt;ref name=times/&gt; The newspaper also pointed out that it might have been difficult to choose a skipper from a group of professionals who considered themselves eligible for the role; it added that Rhodes might have found it hard to captain the side as bowlers had historically struggled to be good leaders.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{Cite news| title = County Captains. Qualifications for leadership | newspaper = The Times  | location = London  | page = 4   | date = 19 December 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Worsley captained for just two seasons. He struggled with the demands of fielding, while his batting was disappointing. However, he was widely respected by the team. He was slightly more effective in his second season as leader, after which he retired.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; The next skipper, [[Alan Barber]], although regarded as successful, captained for just one season. He was a more accomplished batsman and a great disciplinarian.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 108–9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he chose a career in teaching, limiting his availability, and resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/228603.html| title = Obituaries in 1985 (Alan Barber)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1986| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | accessdate = 18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The captain after that, [[Frank Greenwood]], also did not hold the post long, resigning due to business commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/228441.html| title = Obituaries in 1963 (Frank Greenwood)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1964| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| accessdate = 18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Hawke, writing in 1932, noted there had been eight captains since he retired in 1910. While six of them won the [[County Championship]] in their first season in charge, he stated that "it is not good for a side to be always changing its captain".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bapty |first=John |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152404.html |title=Yorkshire the top county |work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |year=1969 |publisher=John Wisden &amp; Co |accessdate=30 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930180207/http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152404.html |archivedate=30 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Lord Hawke| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151749.html| title = Fifty years of Yorkshire county| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1931 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| accessdate = 27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only when [[Brian Sellers]] was appointed in 1933 did Yorkshire gain the leader they wanted. After skippering most games in 1932 during Greenwood's frequent absences, he remained in the role until 1947 and was considered the best county captain of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last=Frith| first=David| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/20657.html| title = Brian Sellers| publisher = EspnCricinfo| accessdate = 21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leicestershire CCC|Leicestershire]] appointed [[Ewart Astill]] as their captain for the 1935 season, he became the first professional  to lead any county on a regular basis since the 19th century.&lt;ref name=SW397/&gt; Yorkshire did not have a professional skipper in the 20th century until [[Vic Wilson (cricketer)|Vic Wilson]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/433121.html| title = Vic Wilson | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 2009 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | accessdate = 21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Gibson believed that Yorkshire erred in rejecting Sutcliffe. He further argued that, if appointed, Sutcliffe would have been made England Test captain in 1931 instead of [[Douglas Jardine]] and that he would have done a good job for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, pp. 154, 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe later regretted withdrawing his acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, he told [[Bill Bowes]] that [[Jack Hobbs]], Sutcliffe's opening partner on the national side, should have been made England captain. According to Bowes, he said, "{{'}}Lord Hawke lifted professional cricket from there to there'&amp;nbsp;... raising his hand from knee to shoulder level. 'Professional cricketers lifted it to there,' he continued, raising his hand above his head, '—and even Lord Hawke wanted it back again. Jack Hobbs, for the sake of the professional cricketer, should have accepted.{{'}}"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bowes  |first=Bill  |title=Express Deliveries  |year=1949   |publisher=Stanley Paul  |location=London |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe's son [[Billy Sutcliffe|Billy]] subsequently captained Yorkshire from 1956 to 1958.&lt;ref name=H113/&gt;
