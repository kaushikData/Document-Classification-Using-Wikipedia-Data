'''''Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs''''' is the first expansion pack for the [[real-time strategy game]] ''[[Age of Empires III]]''. It was  released on October 17, 2006 in the United States.&lt;ref name="Game Details"/&gt; The expansion pack was bundled with the full game of ''Age of Empires III'', called ''Age of Empires III Gold Edition'' on October 23, 2007. The Mac version was ported over, developed and published by [[Destineer]]'s [[MacSoft]]. The full game for Mac was released on June 12, 2007 in the United States. It was followed by a second expansion pack to the original game called ''[[Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties]]''.

==Gameplay changes==
There are no major changes to the mechanics to ''Age of Empires III'' - players are still expected to gather resources, build armies and send them to attack opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/06/06/age-of-empires-iii-the-war-chiefs-civilization-feature|title=Age of Empires III: The Warchiefs, Civilization Features|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 6, 2006|accessdate=October 5, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020190502/http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/06/06/age-of-empires-iii-the-war-chiefs-civilization-feature|archivedate=October 20, 2012|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, there are a number of new concepts introduced, whilst existing concepts have been expanded.

While the [[Aztec]]s have a home city, the [[Iroquois]] and [[Sioux]] have five members of the Tribal Council: the Chief, the War Leader, the Shaman, the Wise Woman, and the Messenger. They all offer different units, supports, and improvements. The tribal council is present in the game when a native civilization advances in age (replacing the politician system of the European civilizations); the player can select to promote a candidate to the Tribal Council and this confers a bonus on the player. The candidates offer higher bonuses at later ages. Typically the type of bonus remains the same (extra units, bonus resources) and new candidates become available at higher home city levels.

Other additions to the game include new minor native tribes: the expansion increases the original game's 12 tribes to 16. The [[Wyandot people|Huron]] replaced the Iroquois, the [[Cheyenne]] replaced the Lakota (Sioux) and the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] replaced the Aztec. Other new tribes include the [[Klamath people|Klamath]], the [[Apache]], the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and the [[Mapuche]].

A Fire Pit is available to all Native civilizations. By tasking villagers dance at the Pit, a range of up to ten dances per civilization are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/08/10/age-of-empires-iii-the-warchiefs-the-aztecs|title=Age of Empires III: The Warchiefs - The Aztecs|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 9, 2006|accessdate=October 5, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020191152/http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/08/10/age-of-empires-iii-the-warchiefs-the-aztecs|archivedate=October 20, 2012|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dances can be learned through Home City shipments are The Town Dance which improves building HP and attack, and the Water Dance which improves naval combat.

The Iroquois have the unique Founder Dance, which spawns new Travois, and the Earth Mother Dance, which increases maximum population. The Sioux have the Fire Dance, which increases unit damage to buildings and ships to mitigate their lack of siege weapons, and the War Song Dance, which produces free Dog Soldier cavalry. The Aztecs have the Healing Dance (all idle units automatically regenerate health) to compensate for the limit on Warrior Priests, and the Garland War Dance to spawn the free Skull Knights.

Additionally, each Native Civilization has its share of unique technologies. There is one unique technology per building except for the Sioux teepee, and the technologies' effects range from delivering shipments of resources or units to upgrading unit capabilities.

===Revolutions===
[[File:TWC Peru Argentina.png|thumb|250px|right|A sample revolution screen where the player ([[German Empire|German civilization]]) decides whether to pick [[Simón Bolívar]] ([[Peru]]) or [[José de San Martín]] ([[Argentina]]), and their respective bonuses.]]
European colonies have a new option open to them in the Industrial age; instead of advancing to the Imperial age, they can revolt from the home nation and found their own country. The initial cost of [[revolution|revolting]] is cheaper than advancing to the Imperial age, but the nation's economy will stagnate because all settlers will turn into [[militia]] and no new ones can be built (except Coureur des Bois from a Cree Village).  Resources can continue to be delivered from pre-constructed ships, tributed resources, trading posts, factories and for the Dutch, banks. A new nation may not upgrade units to the Imperial Age.

===Stealth===
Another new feature is the use of stealth. This enables certain units to remain undetected by most enemy units and buildings. All native civilizations have a unit that can use stealth (this cannot be activated when enemy units are nearby). For the Europeans, there are spies that can be sent from the home city or recruited from the church. Spies are particularly effective against explorers and war chiefs due to their bonus attack. They all share the stealth ability, as do other miscellaneous units (ninja, native scouts, etc.). When certain enemy soldiers are near the invisible unit, the unit will be revealed and vulnerable to attack. Stealth units also become visible when they attack.

==Plot==

The campaign, which is 15 missions long, includes the Black family in a more historical setting. The first act, ''Fire'', follows Nathaniel Black (John Black's son and Amelia Black's father) as he spends the family's entire fortune supporting the [[American Revolution]].  The second act, ''Shadow'', follows Amelia Black's son, Chayton Black, and his actions in the Black Hills during [[Red Cloud's War]] and [[Great Sioux War]]. The home city for both acts is the Black Family Estate.

===Act 1: Fire===

Nathaniel Black (loosely based on [[Joseph Louis Cook]]) is the half-Iroquois son of the late John Black from Act 2 in the previous game, raised by his mother Nonahkee and his uncle Kanyenke. The campaign opens as Nathaniel and Kanyenke are trying to discourage the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] and the [[Seneca people|Seneca]] from [[American Revolutionary War#Native Americans|fighting]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. However, they are ambushed by a group of Mohawks and head to an [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] village nearby. From there they counter-attack and destroy an enemy Town Center, thus causing their enemies to flee. When Nathaniel and Kanyenke return to their village, they find that the Mohawk and a group of [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] mercenaries led by Colonel Sven Kuechler, have raided the village and captured Nonahkee. They rescue Nonahkee, but Kuechler and his main army escape, leaving the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] to dissolve. Nathaniel's village supports the colonists, and Nathaniel heads to [[Boston]] where his men help defend a redoubt on [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Breed's Hill]] from the British. After [[George Washington]] takes command, a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|series of defeats]] drives the colonials back across the Delaware, where they are joined by Nathaniel. Here, Washington leads a small force, including Nathaniel, [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|across the Delaware]] where they attack a Hessian encampment at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and defeat the rearguard of the army at [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]]. This is followed by another victory at the [[Battles of Saratoga]]. However, the army is once again defeated at [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]] and [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]] and is forced to camp for the winter at [[Valley Forge]], where they suffer greatly from the cold. This leads Nathaniel to use most of his family's fortune to supply the army throughout the winter. The next scenario is the fictional battle of Morristown, where Nathaniel has his chance for revenge on Kuechler, who leads an attempt to destroy the capitol building of Morristown. Using artillery shipments he receives from Washington, Nathaniel sneaks around the Hessian flank and relieves Morristown. Refusing to accept defeat, Kuechler joins the fight with Nathaniel and is killed. After Kuechler's death, Nathaniel is said to have fought at [[Siege of Charleston|Charleston]], [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], and [[Battle of King's Mountain|King's Mountain]]. As the tide begins to turn, the French join the war and help the revolutionaries gain a victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]], where Nathaniel is instrumental in capturing several redoubts. With the Revolution won, Nathaniel returns home a poor man having spent his family fortune on outfitting his volunteers and supplying the troops at Valley Forge. During the epilogue video of the campaign (where Nathaniel is at Yorktown), the "Old Coot" (secretly Morgan Black) from Acts 1 and 3 in the previous game can be seen watching his great-grandson's victory.

===Act 2: Shadow===

In 1866, Chayton Black, Amelia Black's half-[[Lakota people|Lakota]] son whose father died when he was too young to remember, is expanding the Falcon Railroad Company westward along the [[Bozeman Trail]] but winds up in the middle of [[Red Cloud's War]]. He helps defend the wood trail from the [[Sioux Indian|Sioux]] and becomes friends with [[Fort Laramie]]'s quartermaster, William "Billy" Holme, an aged Civil War veteran. Ten years later, in 1876, Chayton returns to the west and again meets up with Holme, now a sheriff, who informs him of a huge amount of gold in the [[Black Hills]] of Dakota. After defending many mining camps from Sioux attacks, Chayton goes to see the Sioux chief [[Crazy Horse]] and establish a peace treaty. However, Holme and some of the miners ambush the Sioux before Chayton can begin negotiations, wrecking any chance of peace. Despite the sheriff's warmongering, Chayton still sides with Holme and defends his workers as they gather wood for a new fort. However, once the fort is complete, Holme orders Chayton to destroy a Sioux village without provocation. Chayton refuses and, turning against Holme, allies with the Sioux to destroy the fort, forcing Holme to flee into the hills. Chayton then convinces the newly arrived [[George Armstrong Custer|General Custer]] to give him one day to find Holme, who is the real cause of the unrest. Chayton puts on Sioux clothing and blood-red war paint and, joining with Crazy Horse, chases down Holme and confronts him in a mine. Chayton hopes to resolve the situation peacefully, but Holme pulls a gun on Chayton. However, Chayton draws his gun more quickly and shoots Holme, who falls down a mineshaft to his explosive death. Chayton then tries to convince General Custer not to attack the Sioux, but Custer refuses and demands that Chayton choose sides: the United States or the Natives, saying that he can no longer sit on the fence. Chayton agrees, bidding Custer goodbye and siding with the Sioux. He helps gather the Sioux and Cheyenne nations and fights with them at the [[Battle of Little Bighorn|Little Bighorn]]. After the battle, Amelia Black narrates that she never saw her son again, but she has heard that Chayton was either killed at [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]] in 1890, taking a dozen cavalrymen with him, or lived out his days in the Black Hills with his wife and children.

==Other versions==
''The WarChiefs'' expansion pack was bundled with ''Age of Empires III Complete Collection'', featuring the full game of ''Age of Empires III'', ''The WarChiefs'', and the second released expansion ''[[Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties|The Asian Dynasties]]'', released on September 15, 2009, in the United States.

''Age of Empires III'', ''The WarChiefs'' and ''The Asian Dynasties'' have been ported to Mac OS X by [[MacSoft]].

'''Aliki Stamatina Vougiouklaki''' ({{lang-el|Αλίκη Σταματίνα Βουγιουκλάκη}} {{IPA-el|aˈlici stamaˈtina vuʝuˈklaci}}; 20 July 1934&amp;nbsp;– 23 July 1996) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[actress]], best known for her films and theatrical plays, and theatrical producer. She was one of the most popular actresses in Greece, and was given the title of the [[Superstar|National Star]] of [[Greece]]. Theatrically she has mostly created renditions of widely known [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musicals]] as well as Greek tragedy plays. She died after fighting pancreatic cancer at the age of 62.

==Biography==
Vougiouklaki was born in [[Marousi]]. Daughter of Emmy Koumoundourou and Ioannis Vougiouklakis, who was the provincial governor of Arcadia in the Peloponnese during the war and was executed by the resistance organization [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] as a collaborator. She had two brothers, [[Takis Vougiouklakis]] ([[film director]]) and Antonis (an [[architect]]).

As a student, she used to participate in school plays which eventually led her to an acting career. In 1952, she secretly auditioned for [[National Theatre of Greece]], passed the exams and started attending the classes. She graduated 3 years later with ''Very Good'', after receiving ''Very Good'' by just one teacher of hers, when the rest of them gave her an ''Excellent.''

==Career==
Her first theatrical role was in ''[[The Imaginary Invalid]]'', [[Molière]], in 1953, while her first movie was in 1954, called The Little Mouse. She appeared in 42 movies, mostly [[Musical film|musicals]], television programs and theatre productions. She co-starred with [[Dimitris Papamichail]] in most of the movies and in a number of theatrical plays.

She received the prize for lead woman's role at the inaugural Greek Cinema Festival in [[Thessaloniki]] in 1960 for her starring role in Mantalena, while the movie [[Ipolochagos Natassa]]. (1970) is the biggest box office success in Greek Cinema. The following two also belong to her.

In 1961 she established her own theater company and presented successful theatrical plays. In 1962 she was contracted to star in [[Finos Films]]' English language film ''[[Aliki (film)|Aliki, My love]]'' (also known as ''Aliki''). It premiered in London in June 1963, June 1963 in New York, and in Athens in 1964. It didn't receive the expected success. This failure to break it internationally was the reason she never again attempted an "international movie star" career.

She was popularly known in press as National Star of Greece - a term first coined by journalist [[Helen Vlachos|Eleni Vlahou]] in 1959. Her last movie was "Nelly, The Spy" (Κατάσκοπος Νέλλη), in 1981. The decline of Greek Cinema lead her into concentrating on her theatrical career, establishing 53 plays. In 1975 she brought on stage large scale musicals, which changed the usual Greek style of theatrical musical.

In 2008, her son published a biography of Vougiouklaki, ''Eho Ena Mistiko'' (''I Have A Secret''), the title of a song  she sang in &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Maidens Cheeks|Maidens' Cheeks]]. That same year, a television series was broadcast based on the book, aired on [[Alpha TV]] channel.

==Personal life==
Vougiouklaki married her co-student in National Theater and co-player, Dimitris Papamichail, on January 18, 1965. On June 4, 1969, she gave birth to their child, Yiannis Papamichail. The couple got divorced in 1975, due to "Irreconcilable Differences". In 1992 in an interview with [[Nikos Hadjinikolaou]], Vougiouklaki revealed that she secretly married Giorgos Iliadis, a [[Greek Cypriot]] businessman,  on January 25, 1982, in Athens. They had met in 1976. The couple got a divorce only a couple of months later, due to Iliadi's personal reasons, which Vougiouklaki respected.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Death==
In April 1996, while on tour in Thessaloniki performing "[[The Sound of Music]]", Vougiouklaki had severe stomachaches, which she believed were caused by the antibiotics she took due to the bronchitis which had been bothering her. After performing tests at the Express Service, a medical diagnostic center in [[Thessaloniki]], she was diagnosed with [[hepatoma]], a malignant tumor in her [[liver]]. Not having realized the gravity of the situation, she continued performing for another week before the tour was finally canceled, with her last performance onstage being on April 28.

In Athens, a group of three professor doctors discovered that the actress had [[pancreatic cancer]]. On May 7, she traveled to [[Munich]], where she underwent a series of additional tests during the three days she stayed there. On May 10, Vougiouklaki returned to Greece. On May 15, she made her last trip to [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in the U.S. in a final effort to be cured. On May 19, she returned permanently to Athens and finally, on May 22 entered the Athens Medical Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webpressunion.blogspot.gr/2013/07/blog-post_4775.html|title=ΕΤΣΙ ...ΕΦΥΓΕ Η ΑΛΙΚΗ ΒΟΥΓΙΟΥΚΛΑΚΗ..|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zappit.gr/default.php?pname=Article&amp;cat_id=8&amp;art_id=16640|title=16 χρόνια χωρίς την Αλίκη- Δείτε την τελευταία της συνέντευξη και πως κάλυψαν τα κανάλια την κηδεία της... - zappit.gr|date=23 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ola-ta-kala.blogspot.gr/2013/07/blog-post_4161.html|title=Η πορεία προς το θάνατο - Οι τρεις τελευταίοι μήνες της Αλίκης Βουγιουκλάκη|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 14 she fell into [[hepatic coma]] and had no communication with those around her. After two months of hospitalization, Vougiouklaki died on July 23, 1996 at 10:15 in Athens Medical Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oneirodrama.blogspot.com/2010/07/14.html|title=14 χρόνια που η Αλίκη δεν είναι εδω...|first=Αναρτήθηκε από Kαλλιτεχνιδα|last=Ονειρων|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her funeral was held in Athens Cathedral on July 25, 1996 and she was buried in the [[First Cemetery of Athens]].

* The film, ''[[Ipolochagos Natassa]]'' (1970) sold 751,000 tickets in Athens, which made it the most successful film in Greece, a record held for almost three decades before being broken by [[Safe Sex (film)|Safe Sex]].&lt;ref name="greektenies.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greektenies.com/tainies/upolokhagos-natassa.html|title=Εκτός λειτουργίας! - GreekTenies - Ελληνικές Ταινίες|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* She worked with writer [[Willy Russell]] when she performed in ''[[Shirley Valentine]]'' onstage in 1989.
* Scottish writer [[Ali Smith]] used a portrait of Vougiouklaki (from the picture Klotsoskoufi by Dinos Dimopoulos, 1960) in her book ''Artful'' about four lectures given at [[Oxford University]] by the writer.

Joesoef, the [[black-and-white]] film was cast and advertised to cater to the growing [[native Indonesians|native]] intelligentsia. Despite mixed reviews, it was a commercial success. As with most films of the Indies, ''Asmara Moerni'' may be [[lost film|lost]].

== Plot ==
After four years of doing his residency in [[Singkawang]], Borneo, Dr. Pardi ([[Adnan Kapau Gani]]) returns to [[Java]] to open a practice. Before then, he goes to Cigading to visit his family and give them souvenirs. Upon arrival he is stunned to find that his family's maid Tati ([[Djoewariah]]), who had been his childhood playmate, is now a grown and beautiful woman. He secretly begins to fawn over Tati, although he does not tell her the reason. When Pardi's mother tells him he should marry quickly, he refuses all of her suggested brides. He says only that he already has someone in mind, aware that his mother would never approve an inter-class marriage with the maid.

Tati's fiancé, Amir (S. Joesoef), is jealous of all the attention that Tati is receiving, which leaves her no time for him. He plans to leave Cigading for the capital, Batavia (today [[Jakarta]]), where he will find work. Tati, upon learning this, joins him. She lives at her aunt's home in the city, making a living by washing clothes, while he finds lodging with a local man and learns to drive a ''[[pedicab|becak]]'' (pedicab). Together they begin saving for their wedding. Unknown to them, Pardi has cut short his time in Cigading to move to Batavia, both to begin his new job and to find Tati.

Days before the wedding, Amir is playing his flute when he is approached by a singer known as Miss Omi, who asks him to join her troupe on an international tour. Amir refuses, even after Omi hires him to drive her around the city in an attempt to convince him. After dropping Omi off, Amir is approached by a man who asks him to deliver a package; however, before he can deliver the package Amir is arrested and charged with smuggling [[opium]].

When Amir does not return, Tati and her aunt are worried: as Tati saw Amir with Omi, she fears that the two have run away together. Heartbroken, she intends to return to Cigading. When she and her aunt visit their boss, Abdul Sidik, they unknowingly pass Pardi{{snds}}Abdul Sidik's doctor. Upon returning home, Pardi calls Abdul Sidik and asks him to take Tati in as if she were his daughter and educate her. Tati is a fast learner, and is soon comparable to any woman from a wealthy family.

After being held eighteen months without trial, Amir is released and returned to Batavia. He is unable to find Tati, leaving him to wander the streets. Omi spots him, and again she asks him to play with her troupe. Amir agrees, and soon newspapers are filled with advertisements touting his name. Spotting one, Tati and Abdul Sidik go to a performance, only to learn that Amir was the victim of a car accident. At the hospital, where Amir is being treated by Pardi, Tati learns the truth behind Amir's absence. On his deathbed, Amir asks Pardi to take care of Tati; the two are later married.{{efn|Derived from the novelisation published by Kolff-Buning.}}

''Asmara Moerni'' was directed by [[Rd Ariffien]], a former journalist who had been active in the [[Indonesian National Awakening|nationalist]] and [[labour movement]]s before turning to theatre.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=232}} He had joined [[Union Films]]&amp;nbsp;– the company behind ''Asmara Moerni''&amp;nbsp;– in 1940, making his debut with ''[[Harta Berdarah]]'' (''Bloody Treasure'').{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Rd Ariffien}} Union's head Ang Hock Liem produced,{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Asmara Moerni}} while the story was written by journalist [[Saeroen]],{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna: 'Asmara Moerni'}} who had joined Union after commercial success on [[Albert Balink]]'s ''[[Terang Boelan]]'' (''Full Moon'', 1937) and with the production house [[Tan's Film]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Saeroen}}

The [[black-and-white]] film starred Adnan Kapau Gani, Djoewariah, and S. Joesoef.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Asmara Moerni}}; {{harvnb|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, (untitled)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the feature film debut of Gani and Joesoef,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biran|2009|pp=262–63}}; {{harvnb|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, (untitled)}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Djoewariah had been on Union's payroll since ''[[Bajar dengan Djiwa]]'' (''Pay with Your Soul'') the preceding year.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djuariah}}

At the time there was a growing movement to attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools run by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]], and convince them to view domestic films, which were generally considered to be of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=260}} This was blamed, in part, on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew.{{efn|This included [[Roekiah]], [[Kartolo]], [[Fifi Young]], [[Astaman]], [[Ratna Asmara]], and [[Andjar Asmara]]. See {{harvtxt|Biran|2009|p=204}}.}} As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement, to join the cast. Although some nationalists considered Gani's involvement in ''Asmara Moerni'' as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary: he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=262–63}}

== Release and reception ==
''Asmara Moerni'' was premiered on 29 April 1941 at Orion Theatre in Batavia; the crowds were mostly [[native Indonesians|natives]] and [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]].{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1941, Filmaankondigingen}} Rated for all ages, advertising for the film emphasised Gani's education and Joesoef's upper-class background.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, (untitled)}} It was also advertised as breaking away from the conventional standards of stage theatre, such as music, which were omnipresent in the contemporary film industry.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, (untitled)}} By August 1941 it was screened in [[Singapore]], then part of the [[Straits Settlements]], and billed as a "modern Malay drama".{{sfn|The Straits Times 1941, (untitled)}} A novelisation was published later in 1941 by the [[Yogyakarta]]-based Kolff-Buning.{{sfn|Saeroen|1941|p=1}}

The film was a commercial success,{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=262–63}} though reviews were mixed. An anonymous review for the ''[[Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad]]'' found the film "fascinating",{{efn|Original: "''... boeiend ...''"}} with good acting,{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1941, Filmaankondigingen}} though another review for the same paper found that, though the film was better than contemporary works such as ''[[Pantjawarna]]'' and ''[[Sorga Ka Toedjoe]]'', its claim to abandon stage standards was to be taken "with a pinch of salt".{{efn|Original: "... ''moet men dit wel met een korreltje zout''"}}{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1941, Iets over de Maleische Film}} A review from the [[Surabaya]]-based ''[[Soerabaijasch Handelsblad]]'' found the film full of drama, describing it as "Western [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]], played in the native environment, with a specifically Sundanese situation".{{efn|Original: "... ''een geheel naar westersche motieven opgezet scenario, spelend in het inheemsche milieu met specifiek Soendaneesche decors.''"}}{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna: 'Asmara Moerni'}}

== Legacy ==
After ''Asmara Moerni'', Union produced a further three films;{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=233}} only one, ''[[Wanita dan Satria]]'', was by Rd Ariffien, who left the company soon after,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=263}} as did Saeroen.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=234}} Gani did not act in any further films,{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=262–63}} but instead returned to the nationalist movement. During the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] (1945–49) he became known as a smuggler, and after independence became a government minister.{{sfn|Mufid 2012, Menyelundup untuk Kemakmuran Republik}} In November 2007 Gani was made a [[National Hero of Indonesia]].{{sfn|Suara Merdeka 2007, Presiden Anugerahkan Gelar}} Djoewariah continued to act until the 1950s, when she migrated to theatre after receiving a series of increasingly minor roles.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djuariah}}

''Asmara Moerni'' was screened as late as November 1945.{{sfn|Soeara Merdeka 1945, Pilem}} The film is likely [[lost film|lost]]. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable [[nitrate film]], and after a fire destroyed much of [[Produksi Film Negara]]'s warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed.{{sfn|Biran|2012|p=291}} As such, American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

The '''Big Three television networks''' are the three major traditional [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television network]]s in the [[United States]]: the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), [[CBS]] (formerly known as the Columbia Broadcasting System) and the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC). Beginning  in 1948 until 1986, the Big Three networks dominated U.S. television.&lt;ref name="HindmanWiegand"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The big three's prime-time decline: a technological and social context|url=http://robertoigarza.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/art-the-big-threes-prime-time-decline-hindman-2008.pdf|author=Douglas Blanks Hindman|author2=Kenneth Wiegand|journal=''Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media''|year=2008|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backgrounds==
The National Broadcasting Company and Columbia Broadcasting System were both founded as [[radio network]]s in the 1920s, with NBC eventually encompassing two national radio networks, the prestige [[NBC Red Network|Red Network]] and the lower-profile [[Blue Network]]. They gradually began experimental [[television station]]s in the 1930s, with commercial broadcasts being allowed by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] on July 1, 1941.&lt;ref name="Kisseloff"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Box: An Oral History of Television, 1920-1961|author=Jeff Kisseloff|publisher=Viking|year=1995|location=New York|isbn=0-670-86470-6|pages=42–48, 69–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the [[Government of the United States|U.S. government]] determined that NBC's two-network setup was [[Anticompetitive practice|anticompetitive]] and forced it to spin off one of the networks; NBC chose to sell the Blue Network operations, which became the American Broadcasting Company.&lt;ref name="Kisseloff2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Box: An Oral History of Television, 1920-1961|author=Jeff Kisseloff|publisher=Viking|year=1995|location=New York|isbn=0-670-86470-6|page=505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three networks began regular, commercial television broadcasts in the 1940s. NBC and CBS began commercial operations in 1941, followed by the [[DuMont Television Network]] in 1944 and ABC in 1948.&lt;ref name="Castleman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Watching TV: Four Decades of American Television|author=H. Castleman|author2=W. Podrazik|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|location=New York|page=314|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three networks originally [[owned-and-operated station|controlled]] only a few local television stations, but they swiftly [[network affiliate|affiliated]] with other stations to cover almost the entire United States by the late 1950s. Several of these stations affiliated with all three major networks and DuMont, or some combination of the four, in [[media market|markets]] where only one or two television stations operated in the early years of commercial television; this resulted in several network shows, often those with lower national viewership, receiving scattershot market clearances, since in addition to maintaining limited broadcast schedules early on, affiliates that shoehorned programming from multiple networks had to also make room for locally produced content. As other stations signed on in larger cities, ABC, NBC, and CBS were eventually able to carry at least a sizeable portion of their programming on one station.

Of the four original networks, only DuMont did not have a corresponding radio network. Conversely, the fourth major radio network of the era, the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]], never attempted to enter television, although its component stations launched television outlets in their home cities, nor did it pursue any sort of affiliation with its television-only counterpart, DuMont. Some of Mutual's component stations bought a stake in the [[Overmyer Network]] in 1967, but other than a single late-night talk show, ''[[The Las Vegas Show]]'', which that lasted one month, that network never made it to its full launch.

==Network competition==

===Early era===
For most of the history of television in the United States, the Big Three dominated, controlling the vast majority of television broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/12/cnn-fox-news-msnbc-nbc-ratings-2016-winners-losers-1201762864/|title=Most-Watched Television Networks: Ranking 2016’s Winners and Losers {{!}} IndieWire|last=Schneider|first=Michael|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; DuMont ceased regular programming in 1955; the [[NTA Film Network]], unusual in that its programming, all pre-recorded, was distributed by mail instead of through communications wires, signed on in 1956 and lasted until 1961. From 1961, and lasting until the early 1990s, there were only three major networks. Every hit series appearing in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] top 20 television programs and every successful commercial network telecast of a major [[feature film]] was aired by one of the Big Three networks.&lt;ref name="McNeil"&gt;{{cite book|title=Total Television, 4th edition|author=Alex McNeil|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|year=1996|location=New York|pages=1143–1161|isbn=0-14-024916-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were attempts by other companies, such as the [[Overmyer Network]], to enter the television medium, but all of these ventures lasted only for brief periods. The prohibitive cost of starting a [[broadcast network]], coupled with the difficulty of competing with the massive distribution of the Big Three networks, and the infancy and complexities of [[UHF television broadcasting|UHF]] broadcasting before [[cable television]] became commonplace in the 1980s, led to the downfall of almost all new network ventures; most media markets were limited to no more than three [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channels, and even after the [[All-Channel Receiver Act]] was passed in 1961, the VHF stations were far more efficient and their signals could reach a greater range than their UHF counterparts. As the Big Three networks had already affiliated with most of the more desirable VHF stations, and the full-service approach of the time meant that the networks programmed almost the entire broadcast day, leaving little room for even off-prime-time programming, that left any upstart network to settle for the inferior UHF outlets. Those networks that could have had the resources to compete, such as [[Canada]]'s [[CTV Television Network]], which briefly attempted an American expansion via [[WNYB]] (channel 26 in [[Buffalo, New York]], now a religious station), were forced off the air through legal threats.

===Fox===
A viable [[fourth television network]] in the commercial sense would not again become competitive with the Big Three until [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] was founded in October 1986 from some of the assets and remnants of the DuMont network, which had become [[Metromedia]] after DuMont folded, and were acquired by [[News Corporation]] earlier in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murdoch acquired six Metromedia TV stations|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-03-07/business/fi-16464_1_fox-television-stations|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 7, 1986|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fox, which began as a distant fourth network, [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|leapfrogged into major network status]] in 1994 after [[must-carry]] rules took effect; the rules allowed Fox affiliates to force their way onto cable lineups, and the network's affiliation deal with [[New World Pictures#New World Communications|New World Communications]], which it later purchased in 1996, and the acquisition of [[National Football League]] [[NFL on Fox|broadcast rights]] brought a wave of new Fox affiliates.

Since its founding, Fox has surpassed ABC and NBC in the ratings during the early primetime hours in which it competes against the longer established networks, becoming the second most-watched network behind CBS during the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]]. During the 2007-08 season, Fox was the highest-rated of the major broadcast networks, as well as the first non-Big Three network to reach first place, but it lost the spot in the 2008-09 season and dropped to a close second. From 2004 to 2012, Fox also dominated U.S. television in the lucrative and viewer-rich 18-49 demographics, in large part due to the success of its NFL coverage and its top rated prime time program, ''[[American Idol]]''. Given the network's success in its prime time and [[Fox Sports (United States)|sports]] offerings, it has been occasionally included with the Big Three, in which case the phrase "Big Four" is used.

Although Fox has firmly established itself as the nation's fourth major network with its ratings success, it is not considered part of the Big Three. Among Fox's differences with the Big Three is its reduced weekday programming. It lacks national [[breakfast television|morning]] and evening news programs; Fox has a news division consisting of [[Fox News Channel|cable]] and [[Fox News Radio|radio]] operations, but does not provide content for the broadcast television network other than [[Fox News Sunday|a weekly news analysis program]], limited [[breaking news|special breaking news reports]] and an affiliate news service for its stations called Fox News Edge. Fox does not feature any [[Daytime television in the United States|daytime programming]], a third hour of [[prime time|primetime]], [[late-night talk show]]s, and [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning children's programming]]. Fox had an extensive lineup of children's programs throughout the 1990s called [[Fox Kids]], but sold the division to [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 2001 as part of its sale of cable network [[Freeform (TV channel)|Fox Family Channel]], after which [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] supplied the network's children's lineup until 2009.

Outside prime time, Fox affiliates either produce their own programming or run syndicated shows. Fox is also the only one of the four major networks to include a regular block of [[infomercial]]s on its lineup, via the [[Weekend Marketplace]] Saturday morning block.

===Fifth networks===
Other networks eventually launched in an attempt to not only compete with the Big Three as well as Fox, although these "netlets" have been unable to ascend to the same level of success. [[The WB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Time Warner TV Network to Cover 40% of Nation|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-22543783.html|newspaper=''[[The Buffalo News]]''|publisher=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=November 2, 1993|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UPN]] launched in January 1995; like Fox, they both added nights of prime time programming over the course of a few years, although The WB was the only one that aired any on weekends, carrying a Sunday night lineup for all but its first half-season on the air.

Both networks mainly aired only prime time and children's programming.  The latter was the only form of weekday daytime programming offered by either one, although UPN discontinued its [[Disney's One Too|children's lineup]] in 2003 at the conclusion of a content deal with Disney, and UPN aired sports programming via the short-lived [[XFL]], as well as ''[[WWF SmackDown!]]''.

While The WB and UPN each had a handful of popular series during their existences, they struggled for overall viewership and financial losses. This led their respective parent companies, [[CBS Corporation]] and [[Time Warner]], to shut them down in September 2006 to jointly launch [[The CW]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN and WB to Combine, Forming New TV Network|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/media/24cnd-network.html?bl|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which initially featured a mix of programs from both predecessors as well as some newer shows.

Fox launched [[MyNetworkTV]] at the same time as The CW, with a lineup of English language [[telenovela]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News Corp. Unveils My Network TV|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/102922-News_Corp_Unveils_My_Network_TV.php|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=February 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; it later shifted toward unscripted programs and movies, though its persistent lack of ratings success led News Corporation to convert it into a programming service, relying on a lineup of acquired series, in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MyNetworkTV Shifts From Network to Programming Service|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/173849-MyNetworkTV_Shifts_From_Network_To_Programming_Service_.php|author=Michael Malone|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=February 9, 2009|accessdate=September 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PBS===
Likewise, the [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), which has existed since 1970, is not considered part of the "big three" networks. PBS operates as a [[noncommercial educational|noncommercial]] service with a much different distribution model compared to the major networks; its member stations in essence own the network rather than the traditional mode of a network owning some of its stations and affiliating with additional stations owned by other broadcasters, and it maintains memberships with more than one educational station in a few markets.  Prior to the 1990s, some commercial broadcast networks had affiliations with two stations in a few markets, with both stations carrying a share of the network's programming lineups.

===Market share===
In the 2010s, the "Big Three" control only a relatively small portion of the broadcasting market in the United States, which in 2005, was estimated at a combined 32%.&lt;ref name="HindmanWiegand"/&gt; The Big Three's market share has dwindled considerably as a result of growing competition from broadcast networks such as Fox, The CW and MyNetworkTV and more recently Spanish language networks such as [[Univision]] and [[Telemundo]], as well as national cable and satellite channels such as [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], [[ESPN]] and [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]], and Internet services such as [[Netflix]].&lt;ref name="HindmanWiegand"/&gt;

'''Black comedy''', also known as '''dark comedy''' or '''gallows humor''', is a comic style that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo, particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss. Comedians often use it as a tool for exploring vulgar issues, thus provoking discomfort and serious thought as well as amusement in their audience. Popular themes of the [[genre]] include [[death]] and [[violence]] ([[murder]], [[suicide]], [[abuse]], [[domestic violence]], [[graphic violence]], [[rape]], [[torture]], [[war]], [[genocide]], [[terrorism]], [[corruption]]), [[discrimination]] ([[chauvinism]], [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[homophobia]]), [[disease]] ([[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[nightmare]]s, [[substance abuse|drug abuse]], [[mutilation]], [[disability]], [[terminal illness]], [[insanity]]), [[human sexuality|sexuality]] ([[sodomy]], [[homosexuality]], [[incest]], [[infidelity]], [[fornication]]), [[religion]], and [[Barbarian|barbarism]].

Black comedy differs from [[Ribaldry#blue comedy|blue comedy]] which focuses more on crude topics such as [[nudity]], [[sexual intercourse|sex]], and [[body fluid|bodily fluids]]. Although the two are interrelated, black comedy is also different from straightforward [[obscenity]] in that it is more subtle and does not necessarily have the explicit intention of offending people. In [[off-color humor|obscene humor]], much of the humorous element comes from shock and revulsion, while black comedy might include an element of [[irony]], or even [[fatalism]]. For example, an archetypal example of black comedy in the form of [[self-harm|self-mutilation]] appears in the English novel ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''. Tristram, five years old at the time, starts to urinate out of an open window for lack of a [[chamber pot]]. The sash falls and circumcises him; his family reacts with both hysteria and philosophical acceptance.

Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref name="hobby1"&gt;''Dark Humor''. Edited by Blake Hobby. Chealsea House Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/67959/black-humour|title=Black humour|author=|date=|website=britannica.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garrick2006p175"&gt;Garrick, Jacqueline and Williams, Mary Beth (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7jPyMPAsXwQC&amp;pg=PA175 ''Trauma treatment techniques: innovative trends''] pp.175–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lipman, Steve (1991) ''Laughter in hell: the use of humor during the Holocaust'', Northvale, N.J:J Aronson Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vonnegut1971"&gt;[[Kurt Vonnegut]] (1971) ''Running Experiments Off: An Interview'', interview by Laurie Clancy, published in ''Meanjin Quarterly'', 30 (Autumn, 1971), pp.46–54, and in ''Conversations with Kurt Vonnegut'', quote:{{quotation|The term was part of the language before Freud wrote an essay on it—'gallows humor.' This is middle European humor, a response to hopeless situations. It's what a man says faced with a perfectly hopeless situation and he still manages to say something funny. Freud gives examples: A man being led out to be hanged at dawn says, 'Well, the day is certainly starting well.' It's generally called Jewish humor in this country. Actually it's humor from the peasants' revolt, the forty years' war, and from the Napoleonic wars. It's small people being pushed this way and that way, enormous armies and plagues and so forth, and still hanging on in the face of hopelessness. Jewish jokes are middle European jokes and the black humorists are gallows humorists, as they try to be funny in the face of situations which they see as just horrible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dark Humor"&gt;Bloom, Harold (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Vf6nC8XKWsC&amp;pg=PA80 ''Dark Humor''], ch. ''On dark humor in literature'', pp.80–88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freud 1927 Humor"&gt;Freud (1927) ''Humor''&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the term ''black comedy'' is a relatively broad term covering humor relating to many serious subjects, ''gallows humor'' tends to be used more specifically in relation to death, or situations that are reminiscent of dying.

The black humor can occasionally be related to the [[grotesque]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;Merhi, Vanessa M. (2006) [http://gradworks.umi.com/32/40/3240247.html ''Distortion as identity from the grotesque to l'humour noir'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and etymology ==
[[File:Irony.jpg|thumb|An amusing [[Word play|play on words]]]]

=== Origin of the term ===
The term ''black humor'' (from the French ''humour noir'') was coined by the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] theorist [[André Breton]] in 1935 while interpreting the writings of [[Jonathan Swift]].&lt;ref name="Real05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianBreton"/&gt; Breton's preference was to identify some of Swift's writings as a subgenre of [[comedy]] and [[satire]]&lt;ref name="Black Humor from the Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th Edition, 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Black Humour, The Hutchinson Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/black+humor |title=black humor – Hutchinson encyclopedia article about black humor |publisher=Encyclopedia.farlex.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which laughter arises from [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] and [[skepticism]],&lt;ref name="Real05"&gt;Real, Hermann Josef (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=L7jEg8rQZoUC The reception of Jonathan Swift in Europe], p.90 quote: {{quotation|At least, Swift's text is preserved, and so is a prefactory note by the French writer André Breton, which emphasizes Swift's importance as the originator of black humor, of laughter that arises from cynicism and scepticism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BretonSwiftIntro"/&gt; often relying on topics such as death.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Leclair (1975) [https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=589E4DCAE3AB2134D7AA2D9EBD790497.inst3_3a?docId=95258188 ''Death and Black Humor''] in ''Critique'', Vol. 17, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowe|first=W.

Breton coined the term for his book ''[[Anthology of Black Humor]]'' (''Anthologie de l'humour noir''), in which he credited [[Jonathan Swift]] as the originator of black humor and gallows humor (particularly in his pieces ''Directions to Servants'' (1731), ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' (1729), ''[[A Meditation Upon a Broom-Stick]]'' (1710), and in a few [[aphorism]]s).&lt;ref name="GuardianBreton"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/21/anthology-of-black-humour | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Nicholas | last=Lezard | authorlink=Nicholas Lezard | title=From the sublime to the surreal | date=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BretonSwiftIntro"&gt;[[André Breton]] introduction to Swift in ''[[Anthology of Black Humor]]'', quote: {{quotation|When it comes to black humor, everything designates him as the true initiator. In fact, it is impossible to coordinate the fugitive traces of this kind of humor before him, not even in Heraclitus and the Cynics or in the works of Elizabethan dramatic poets. [...] historically justify his being presented as the first black humorist. Contrary to what Voltaire might have said, Swift was in no sense a "perfected Rabelais." He shared to the smallest possible degree Rabelais's taste for innocent, heavy-handed jokes and his constant drunken good humor. [...] a man who grasped things by reason and never by feeling, and who enclosed himself in skepticism; [...] Swift can rightfully be considered the inventor of "savage" or "gallows" humor.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Breton also included excerpts from 45 other writers, including both examples in which the wit arises from a victim with which the audience empathizes, as is more typical in the tradition of gallows humor, and examples in which the comedy is used to mock the victim. In the last cases, the victim's suffering is trivialized, which leads to sympathizing with the victimizer, as analogously found in the social commentary and social criticism of the writings of (for instance) [[Marquis de Sade|Sade]].

=== Adoption in American literary criticism ===
Among the first American writers who employed black comedy in their works were [[Nathanael West]]&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Merriam-Webster, Inc (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA144 ''Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of literature''], entry ''black humor'', p.144&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Vladimir Nabokov]],&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; although at the time the genre was not widely known in the US. The concept of black humor first came to nationwide attention after the publication of a 1965 mass-market [[paperback]] titled ''Black Humor'', of which the editor was [[Bruce Jay Friedman]].&lt;ref name="Dark Humor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=O'Neill | first=Patrick | chapter=The Comedy of Entropy: The Contexts of Black Humor | title=Dark Humor | editor1=Harold Bloom | editor2=Blake Hobby | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Vf6nC8XKWsC&amp;pg=PA80 | page=82 | series=Bloom's Literary Themes | year=2010 | publisher=Infobase Publishing | location=New York, New York | isbn=9781438131023 | accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paperback was one of the first American anthologies devoted to the concept of black humor as a literary genre.&lt;ref name="Freud 1927 Humor"/&gt; With the paperback, Friedman labeled as "black humorists" a variety of authors, such as [[J.P. Donleavy]],&lt;ref name="Dark Humor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freud 1927 Humor"/&gt; [[Edward Albee]],&lt;ref name="Dark Humor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freud 1927 Humor"/&gt; [[Joseph Heller]],&lt;ref name="Dark Humor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freud 1927 Humor"/&gt; [[Thomas Pynchon]],&lt;ref name="Dark Humor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freud 1927 Humor"/&gt; [[John Barth]],&lt;ref name="Dark Humor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freud 1927 Humor"/&gt; [[Vladimir Nabokov]],&lt;ref name="Dark Humor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freud 1927 Humor"/&gt; [[Bruce Jay Friedman]]&lt;ref name="Dark Humor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freud 1927 Humor"/&gt; himself, and [[Louis-Ferdinand Celine]].&lt;ref name="Dark Humor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freud 1927 Humor"/&gt; Among the writers labeled as black humorists by journalists and literary critics are today also [[Roald Dahl]],&lt;ref&gt;James Carter [https://books.google.com/books?id=IQDVsfeTHeAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=roald%20dahl%20black%20humour Talking Books: Children's Authors Talk About the Craft, Creativity and Process of Writing, Volume 2] p.97 Routledge, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Vonnegut]],&lt;ref name="Black Humor from the Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th Edition, 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-blackhum.html|title=black humor – Dictionary definition of black humor – Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warren Zevon]], [[Christopher Durang]], and [[Philip Roth]].&lt;ref name="Black Humor from the Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th Edition, 2008"/&gt; The motive for applying the label black humorist to all the writers cited above is that they have written novels, poems, stories, plays, and songs in which profound or horrific events were portrayed in a comic manner. Comedians, like [[Lenny Bruce]],&lt;ref name="Black Humour, The Hutchinson Encyclopedia"/&gt;  that since the late 1950s have been labeled for using "[[sick comedy]]" by mainstream journalists, have also been labeled with "black comedy".

== Nature and functions ==
[[File:Motke2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Jewish humor]] book featuring [[Hershel of Ostropol]]]]

[[Sigmund Freud]] in his 1927 essay ''Humour'' (''Der Humor'') puts forth the following theory of black comedy: "The ego refuses to be distressed by the provocations of reality, to let itself be compelled to suffer. It insists that it cannot be affected by the traumas of the external world; it shows, in fact, that such traumas are no more than occasions for it to gain pleasure." Some other sociologists elaborated this concept further. At the same time, [[Paul Lewis (professor)|Paul Lewis]] warns that this "relieving" aspect of gallows jokes depends on the context of the joke: whether the joke is being told by the threatened person themselves or by someone else.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewis, "Three Jews and a Blindfold: The Politics of Gallows Humor", In: "Semites and Stereotypes: Characteristics of Jewish Humor" (1993), {{ISBN|0-313-26135-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4k5rE4eHjMC&amp;pg=PA53#PPA49,M1 p. 49]&lt;/ref&gt;

Black comedy has the social effect of strengthening the [[morale]] of the oppressed and undermines the morale of the oppressors.&lt;ref&gt;Obrdlik, Antonin J. (1942) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2769536 ''"Gallows Humor"-A Sociological Phenomenon''], American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 47, No. 5 (Mar., 1942), pp. 709–716&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mariah Snyder, Ruth Lindquist [https://books.google.com/books?id=vdl4s1zHPdIC&amp;pg=PA111 ''Complementary and alternative therapies in nursing'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Wylie Sypher]], "to be able to laugh at evil and error means we have surmounted them."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wylie Sypher]] quoted in ZhouRaymond, Jingqiong [https://books.google.com/books?id=cLTsZ39XW80C&amp;pg=PA132 ''Carver's short fiction in the history of black humor''] p.132&lt;/ref&gt;

Black comedy is a natural human instinct and examples of it can be found in stories from antiquity. Its use was widespread in [[middle Europe]], from where it was imported to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Vonnegut]] (1971) ''Running Experiments Off: An Interview'', in ''Conversations with Kurt Vonnegut'' quote: {{quotation|The term was part of the language before Freud wrote an essay on it – 'gallows humour.' This is middle European humour, a response to hopeless situations. It's what a man says faced with a perfectly hopeless situation and he still manages to say something funny. Freud gives examples: A man being led out to be hanged at dawn says, 'Well, the day is certainly starting well.' It's generally called Jewish humour in this country. Actually it's humour from the peasants' revolt, the thirty years' war, and from the Napoleonic wars. It's small people being pushed this way and that way, enormous armies and plagues and so forth, and still hanging on in the face of hopelessness. Jewish jokes are middle European jokes. And the black humourists are gallows humourists, as they try to be funny in the face of situations which they see as just horrible.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is rendered with the German expression ''Galgenhumor''. The concept of gallows humor is comparable to the French expression ''rire jaune'' (lit. ''yellow laughing''),&lt;ref&gt;Redfern, W. D. and Redfern, Walter (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SU0MxAMRCawC&amp;pg=PA211 ''Calembours, ou les puns et les autres : traduit de l'intraduisible ''], p.211 quote: {{quotation|Des termes parents du ''Galgenhumor'' sont: : comédie noire, plaisanterie macabre, rire jaune.

In all, pain and pleasure are mixed, perhaps the definitive recipe for all punning' (Puns, p. 127).}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also has a [[West Germanic languages|Germanic]] equivalent in the [[Flemish|Belgian Dutch]] expression ''groen lachen'' (lit. ''green laughing'').&lt;ref name="Brachin85p101"&gt;Brachin, Pierre (1985) [https://books.google.com/books?id=GeUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA102 ''The Dutch language: a survey''] pp.101–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeGrèveDitl"&gt;Claude et Marcel De Grève, Françoise Wuilmart, ''[http://www.flsh.unilim.fr/ditl/TRADUCTION.htm TRADUCTION / Translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519173702/http://www.flsh.unilim.fr/ditl/TRADUCTION.htm |date=2011-05-19 }}'', section ''Histoire et théorie de la traduction – Recherches sur les microstructures'', in: Grassin, Jean-Marie (ed.), [http://www.ditl.info DITL] (Dictionnaire International des Termes Littéraires), [22 Nov 2010]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1950) [https://books.google.com/books?id=posrAQAAIAAJ ''Zaïre''], Volume 4, Part 1, p.138 quote: {{quotation|En français on dit « rire jaune », en flamand « groen lachen »}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chédel, André (1965) [https://books.google.com/books?id=mQBAAAAAIAAJ ''Description moderne des langues du monde: le latin et le grec inutile?''] p.171 quote: {{quotation|Les termes jaune, vert, bleu évoquent en français un certain nombre d'idées qui sont différentes de celles que suscitent les mots holandais correspondants geel, groen, blauw.

Italian comedian [[Daniele Luttazzi]] discussed gallows humour focusing on the particular type of laughter that it arouses (''risata verde'' or ''groen lachen''), and said that [[grotesque]] [[satire]], as opposed to [[irony|ironic]] satire, is the one that most often arouses this kind of laughter.&lt;ref name="Pardo2001"&gt;Pardo, Denise (2001) [http://quattrostracci.altervista.org/SforzaItalia/intervis2.htm Interview] with Daniele Luttazzi, in ''[[L'Espresso]]'', February 1st, 2001 quote: {{quotation|Q: Critiche feroci, interrogazioni parlamentari: momenti duri per la satira.&lt;br /&gt;
A: Satira è far ridere a spese di chi è più ricco e potente di te. Io sono specialista nella risata verde, quella dei cabaret di Berlino degli anni Venti e Trenta. Nasce dalla disperazione. Esempio: l'Italia è un paese dove la commissione di vigilanza parlamentare Rai si comporta come la commissione stragi e viceversa. Oppure: il mistero di Ustica è irrisolto?

Quote: {{quotation|racconto di satira grottesca [...] L'obiettivo del grottesco è far percepire l'orrore di una vicenda. Non è la satira cui siamo abituati in Italia: la si ritrova nel cabaret degli anni '20 e '30, poi è stata cancellata dal carico di sofferenze della guerra. Aggiungo che io avevo spiegato in apertura di serata che ci sarebbero stati momenti di satira molto diversi. Satira ironica, che fa ridere, e satira grottesca, che può far male. Perché porta alla risata della disperazione, dell'impotenza. La risata verde. Era forte, perché coinvolgeva in un colpo solo tutti i cardini satirici: politica, religione, sesso e morte. Quello che ho fatto è stato accentuare l'interazione tra gli elementi. Non era di buon gusto? Rabelais e Swift, che hanno esplorato questi lati oscuri della nostra personalità, non si sono mai posti il problema del buon gusto.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marmo2004"&gt;Marmo, Emanuela (2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20060506133300/http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node%2F221 Interview] with Daniele Luttazzi (March 2004) quote: {{quotation|Quando la satira poi riesce a far ridere su un argomento talmente drammatico di cui si ride perché non c'è altra soluzione possibile, si ha quella che nei cabaret di Berlino degli Anni '20 veniva chiamata la “risata verde”. È opportuno distinguere una satira ironica, che lavora per sottrazione, da una satira grottesca, che lavora per addizione. Questo secondo tipo di satira genera più spesso la risata verde. Ne erano maestri Kraus e Valentin.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Weimar era]] ''[[Kabarett]]s'', this genre was particularly common, and according to Luttazzi, [[Karl Valentin]] and [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] were the major masters of it.&lt;ref name="Marmo2004"/&gt;

== Examples ==
There are multiple recorded instances of humorous [[last words]] and [[final statement]]s. For example, author and playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] was destitute and living in a cheap [[boarding house]] when he found himself on his deathbed. There are variations on what his exact words were, but his reputed [[q:last words|last words]] were, "Either that wallpaper goes or I do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thoughtcatalog.com/oliver-miller/2012/05/famous-last-words-2/|title=Famous Last Words|date=2012-05-23|work=Thought Catalog|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/seamus-heaney-last-words-list-503430|title=Seamus Heaney, Steve Jobs, Oscar Wilde, Karl Marx: Famous Last Words|last=Gover|first=Dominic|date=2013-09-03|work=International Business Times UK|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gallows speeches===

Examples of [[Final statement|gallows speeches]] include:

* In [[Edo period]] Japan, condemned criminals were occasionally executed by expert swordsmen, who used living bodies to test the quality of their blade (''[[Tameshigiri]]''). There is an apocryphal story of one who, after being told he was to be executed by a sword tester, calmly joked that if he had known that was going to happen, he would have swallowed large stones to damage the blade.&lt;ref name="Man2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Man|first=John|title=Samurai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRdqWcmZcH4C&amp;pg=PA55|date=10 February 2011|publisher=Transworld|isbn=978-1-4090-1105-7|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the first [[Convicts in Australia|convicts transported in Australia by the British Empire]], [[John Caesar]], escaped the penal colony in 1789 and lived as a [[bushranger]] in the wilderness. He survived by raiding garden patches with a stolen gun. When he was eventually caught, according to colonial governor [[David Collins (governor)|David Collins]] he was "so indifferent about meeting death, that he declared in confinement that if he should be hanged he would create a laugh before he was turned off, by playing some trick upon the executioner."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Robert. "The Fatal Shore." Vintage Books. New York. 1986. Page 196.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reprieved but died six years later from gunshot wounds after escaping a second time.
* Murderer [[James French (murderer)|James French]] has been attributed with famous last words before his death by electric chair: "How's this for a headline? '[[French Fries]]'."
* As [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] climbed a rickety scaffold where he would be executed, he said to his executioner: "I pray you, Mr. Lieutenant, see me safe up; and for my coming down, let me shift for myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.bartleby.com/36/2/2.html|title=The Life of Sir Thomas More|last=Roper|first=William|publisher=Collier &amp; Son|year=1909–14|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*At his public execution, the murderer [[William Palmer (murderer)#Arrest and trial|William Palmer]] is said to have looked at the trapdoor on the gallows and asked the hangman, "Are you sure it's safe?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canongate.net/Lists/Crime/WitticismsOf9CondemnedCrimin Witticisms Of 9 Condemned Criminals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314054424/http://www.canongate.net/Lists/Crime/WitticismsOf9CondemnedCrimin |date=2008-03-14 }} at Canongate Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] was beheaded in the Old Palace Yard at the Palace of Westminster on 29 October 1618. "Let us dispatch", he said to his executioner. "At this hour my ague comes upon me. I would not have my enemies think I quaked from fear." After he was allowed to see the axe that would behead him, he mused: "This is a sharp Medicine, but it is a Physician for all diseases and miseries." According to many biographers – [[Raleigh Trevelyan]] in his book ''Sir Walter Raleigh'' (2002) for instance – Sir Walter's final words (as he lay ready for the axe to fall) were: "Strike, man, strike!"{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
* [[Ronald Reagan]], upon being transported to the emergency room after being shot by [[John Hinckley, Jr.]], is reported to have said to his doctors, "Please tell me you’re [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3752477/reagan-assassination-reaction/|title=Read President Reagan's Best Jokes About Being Shot|author=|date=|website=Time|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Prefect of Rome executed [[Saint Lawrence]] in a great gridiron prepared with hot coals beneath it. He had Lawrence placed on it, hence St Lawrence's association with the gridiron. After the martyr had suffered pain for a long time, the legend concludes, he cheerfully declared: "I'm well done. Turn me over!" From this derives his patronage of cooks, chefs, and comedians.

===Military===
[[Military humor|Military life]] is full of gallows humor, as those in the services continuously live in the danger of being killed, especially in wartime. For example:
* The Imperial Japanese Navy [[Mitsubishi G4M]] Isshikirikkou (イッシキリッコウ) "Betty" bomber airplane was called "Hamaki" (葉巻 or はまき, meaning [[cigar]]) by the Japanese crews not only because its fuselage was cigar-shaped, but because it had a tendency to ignite on fire and burn violently when it was hit. The American nickname was "flying [[Zippo lighter|Zippo]]".
* When the survivors of {{HMS|Sheffield|D80|6}}, sunk in 1982 in the [[Falklands War]], were awaiting rescue, they were reported to have sung the [[Monty Python]] song, "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/always-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life|title=Icons of England, "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717050535/http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/always-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life |archivedate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Soviet pilots in World War II joked that the true meaning of the type designation of the [[Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3|LaGG-3]] was ''Lakirovanny Garantirovanny Grob'', "varnished guaranteed coffin".
* Soviet military vehicle [[BMP-1]] was called ''Bratskaya Mogila Pekhoty'' ("mass grave of infantry") by soldiers, as the hit would kill all the crew.
* In the [[Battle of Jutland]] (31 May – 1 June 1916), the destroyer {{HMS|Tipperary|1915|6}} was sunk in an overnight engagement with the heavily armed German dreadnought {{SMS|Westfalen}}. Only 13 survived out of a crew of 197. The survivors were identified in the darkness by the crew of {{HMS|Sparrowhawk|1912|6}} because they were heard in the distance, singing, "[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary|It's a long way to Tipperary]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/rg_seawarfare_jutlandfighting.htm|title=The Fighting at Jutland|last=|first=|date=|website=Kipling Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[Winter War]] the Soviet Union bombed Helsinki, and after Soviets claimed they were air-dropping food to the "starving people of Helsinki" the Finnish people dubbed the Soviet bombs "[[Molotov bread basket]]s", and in return called their firebombs [[Molotov cocktails]], as "a drink to go with the food."
* During World War II, [[Soviet Army|the Soviet soldiers]] dubbed the [[45 mm anti-tank gun M1937 (53-K)]] "Good bye, Motherland!", as its penetration was proving to be inadequate for the task of destroying German tanks, meaning a crew operating one was practically defenseless against the enemy tanks.
* During World War II, United States ships in the [[escort carrier]] category were given the [[ship prefix]] "CVE". Crews joked that this stood for "Combustible, Vulnerable, Expendable" due to the ship's complete lack of armor and high numbers of ships constructed.
* During World War II, British and American soldiers referred to the [[Landing Ship, Tank]], abbreviated LST, as 'Long Slow Target' or 'Large Slow Target' when facing German forces. It was {{convert|382|ft|m|0}} long, but some could only manage {{convert|10|–|12|kn|lk=in}} fully laden.
* After the {{ship|Finnish coastal defence ship|Ilmarinen}} went down with 271 fatalities after hitting a mine on 13 September 1941 the 132 survivors were nicknamed "Ilmarisen uimaseura", "Ilmarinen's swimming club."

===Emergency service workers===
Workers in the [[emergency services]] are also known for using black comedy:
*Graham Wettone, a retired police officer who wrote a book ''How To Be A Police Officer'', noted the presence of black comedy in the police force. He described it as "often not the type of humour that can be understood outside policing or the other emergency services." For example, an officer who attended four cases of suicide by hanging in six months was nicknamed "Albert" (after the hangman [[Albert Pierrepoint]]) and encountered comments like "You hanging around the canteen today?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wettone|first=Graham|title=How To Be A Police Officer|date=2017|publisher=Biteback|isbn=9781785902192|page=4|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
There are several titles ''[[It Only Hurts When I Laugh (disambiguation)|It Only Hurts When I Laugh]]'' and ''[[Only When I Laugh (disambiguation)|Only When I Laugh]]'', which allude to the punch of a joke  which exists in numerous versions since at least 19th century. A typical setup is that someone badly hurt (e.g., a [[Wild West]] rancher with an arrow in his chest, a Jew crucified by the Nazis, etc.) is asked "Does it hurt?" &amp;mdash; "A am fine; it only hurts when I laugh."&lt;ref&gt;Leon Rappoport, ''Punchlines: The Case for Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Humor'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=P3HkmPhf2mYC&amp;pg=PA83 p. 83]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/the-joke-stops-here/Content?oid=1124492 "The Joke Stops Here"], ''[[Memphis Flyer]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* In the conclusion to ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', a group of [[crucified]] criminals joyfully sing "[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]".
* The [[Shel Silverstein]] song, "[[25 Minutes to Go]]".
* In [[Stephen King]]'s science fiction novel ''[[The Tommyknockers]]'' (1987), the main character reflects on a joke he "heard once". In the joke, as a man is about to be executed, the firing squad leader offers him a cigarette. The man replies, "No thanks, I'm trying to quit."
* From [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Act 3, Scene 1:
{{quotation|''Mercutio is stabbed in a swordfight by [[Tybalt]], [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]]'s cousin:''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Carddass'''|カードダス|Kādodasu}} is a name given to  [[Bandai]]'s card [[vending machine]]s and, thus, a generic term given to the cards sold by these machines. The name comes from [[AMeDAS]] (''A''utomated ''Me''terological ''D''ata ''A''cquisition ''S''ystem), a system in [[Japan]] used for gathering weather data. The aim behind this naming is to make Carddass an information source for kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandai.co.jp/releases/J2004052401.html|script-title=ja:プレスリリース｜株式会社バンダイ|publisher=Bandai|language=Japanese|accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carddass is a registered trademark of Bandai.

==History==
The first Carddass, released in 1988, is based on the ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' [[anime]] series.  In the past, Carddass was for trading and collection only. But since [[trading card game]]s like ''[[Pokémon Trading Card Game|Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|Yu-Gi-Oh]]'' became popular in [[Japan]], more and more Carddass is made in the form of [[trading card]]s that can be played in a game.

Apart from ''Saint Seiya'', many popular anime, [[manga]] and [[tokusatsu]] series has been made into Carddass, the most famous ones being {{Or|date=September 2007}} ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', ''[[Toriko]]'', ''[[Hunter x Hunter]]'', ''[[Digimon]]'', ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Kinnikuman]]'', ''[[Gin Tama]]'', ''[[Black Butler]]'', ''[[Code Geass]]'', ''[[Soul Eater (manga)|Soul Eater]]'', ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', ''[[Gundam]]'', ''[[Kamen Rider]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'', ''[[YuYu Hakusho]]'', ''[[Ranma ½]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[InuYasha]]'', ''[[Slam Dunk (manga)|Slam Dunk]]'', ''[[Konjiki no Gash!!|Konjiki no Gash Bell!!]]'', ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'', ''[[Ultraman]]'', and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' (the Carddass game is based on Toei's anime and is not to be confused with [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|Konami's card game]]). 

In 2006, a [[Super Sentai]]-based trading card game, ''[[Rangers Strike]]'', was released in commemoration of the Super Sentai Series' 30th Anniversary.

In 2007, Carddass started to sell [[Top Trumps]] in Japan.

A digital version of the game, ''[[Data Carddass]]'', was introduced in 2005. This series revolves around [[arcade game|arcade]] machines that can read specially designed cards to access in-game content, such as weapons, characters or clothes. Also recently introduced are ''AR Carddass'', which utilises [[augmented reality]] features in [[smartphone]]s, and ''Net Carddass'' which utilises online functionality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7237">The '''cash for comment affair''' was an Australian scandal that broke in 1999, concerning paid advertising in radio that is presented to the audience in such a way as to sound like editorial commentary. [[John Laws]], a [[shock jock]] radio presenter for Sydney [[talk radio|talk back]], was accused of misusing his authority as an announcer.&lt;ref name="mtmb"/&gt; This was widely considered a breach of journalistic integrity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} While the initial publicity had died down by the end of the year, it sparked major changes in the way the [[radio industry]] is conducted in Australia. This resulted in a second scandal in 2004, leading to the resignation of [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]] head [[David Flint]], after he had been found to have been less than impartial in his role in "cash for comment" investigations.

Some have pointed to the ''Broadcasting Services Act (1992)'', which has treated the media more as a business than a cultural institution, for a decline in the relevance of [[ethical standards]] in the media industry.&lt;ref name="eet"&gt;{{cite book |title=Remote Control: New Media, New Ethics |editor=Catharine Lumby and Elspeth Probyn |chapter=Ethics, Entertainment and the Tabloid: The Case of Talkback Radio in Australia |last=Turner |first=Graeme |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |isbn=0-521-53427-5 |page=88 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 July 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporting==
In 1999, reporters [[Richard Ackland]], [[Deborah Richards]] and [[Ann Connelly]] from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|public broadcaster's]] ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' TV program revealed that [[2UE]] [[talk-back|talk radio]] hosts [[John Laws]] and [[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]] had been paid to give [[Advertorial|favourable comment]] to companies including [[Qantas]], [[Optus]], [[Foxtel]], [[Mirvac]] and major Australian banks, without disclosing this arrangement to listeners. Prior to giving favourable commentary to a group of banks, Laws had repeatedly criticised them for imposing unjustified fees on customers while cutting back on services.&lt;ref name="mmm"&gt;{{cite book |title=Media, Markets and Morals |chapter=A Conflict of Media Roles: Advertising, Public Relations and Journalism |last=Spence |first=Edward H. |author2=Andrew Alexandra|author3=Aaron Quinn|author4=Anne Dunn |year=2011 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=West Sussex, United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-4051-7547-0 |page=101 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 July 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Though both initially vehemently denied any wrongdoing, when the controversy gained sufficient{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} momentum, they defended the practice by claiming that they were not employed as journalists, but as "entertainers" and thus had no duty of disclosure or of journalistic integrity.

==Inquiry==

}}
The [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]] estimated the value of these arrangements at $18 million and found Laws, Jones, and 2UE to have committed 90 breaches of the industry code and five breaches of 2UE's license conditions. The inquiry heard that Laws received cash and VIP hospitality at Sydney's [[Star City Casino]] for not discussing negative aspects of gambling.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/nov/15/4 |title=Australian radio stars in cash-for-comment scandal |author=Christopher Zinn |accessdate=18 July 2011 |date=15 November 1999 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |publisher=Guardian News and Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Broadcasting Authority made it clear that Laws was not a journalist, but a radio personality and so journalists' ethical standards didn't apply to him.&lt;ref name="rai"&gt;{{cite book |title=Culture in Australia: Policies, publics and programs |editor=Tony Bennett and David Carter |last=Turner |first=Graeme |chapter=Reshaping Australian Institutions: Political Culture, the Market and the Public Sphere |year=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |isbn=0-521-80290-3 |page=169 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 July 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The inquiry focused on the extent to which deliberate commercial endorsement had led to distortions in which the public was misled about important matters.&lt;ref name="mtmb"&gt;{{cite book |title=More than a Music Box: Radio Cultures and Communities in Multi-media World |chapter=A Medium for Mateship: Commercial Talk Radio in Australia |last=Flew |first=Terry |editor=Andrew Crissell |year=2003 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=1-57181-473-6 |pages=236–243 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 July 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations were subsequently tightened to prevent such behaviour; however, the ABA has been accused of weakness and inconsistency in enforcing these regulations.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Included in the changes were new sponsor disclosure requirements. Laws used a [[cow bell]] to announce sponsor deals following more stringent disclosure requirements.&lt;ref name="fmtp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/confidential/laws-130000-farewell-bill/story-e6freq7o-1111118151573 |title=Fairfax Media to pay John Laws' cash-for-comment fines |accessdate=18 July 2011 |date=26 November 2008 |newspaper=Courier Mail |publisher=News Queensland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Laws and Jones were again accused of cash for comment in relation to deals both had made with [[Telstra]]. Laws was found to have breached the rules but Jones was cleared; the revelation of flattering letters written by ABA head [[David Flint]] to Jones, at the same time that Jones was under investigation, led to accusations of impropriety that ultimately forced Flint's resignation.

==Fines==
2UE was fined $360,000 for John Laws's improper conduct.&lt;ref name="jla"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/john-laws-ads-cost-2ue-radio-360000-20090717-dnlb.html |title=John Laws' ads cost 2UE radio $360,000 |author=Katelyn Catanzariti |accessdate=18 July 2011 |date=17 July 2009 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the radio station was to pay the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] A$10,000 for each of the 13 breaches involving a [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] disclosure requirement. The Communications Law Centre intervened, arguing that a harsher penalty was appropriate.&lt;ref name="jla"/&gt; This led to the Federal Court imposing a larger fine.

{{About|the division of '''Estes Industries'''|Cox models in statistics|proportional hazards models}}
[[Image:Cox-Logo-250-x-250.jpg|right|150px]]

'''Cox Models''', a former division of '''[[Estes Industries]]''' of [[Penrose, Colorado]], was a multimillion-dollar [[hobby]] company, is one of the hobby industry's oldest companies and is noted for its production of miniature model internal-combustion engines.

==History==
The company, originally named '''The L. M. Cox Manufacturing Co, Inc.''', was founded in 1945 by the [[machinist]] [[Leroy_M._Cox|Roy Cox]] in [[Placentia, California]].  Cox grew up in and around his father's bicycle shop, and he developed an interest in mechanical devices.  Cox's first products were wooden [[pop gun]]s, produced in his home garage. Cox chose wood for his basic material, since metal was scarce during WW II.

When metals became readily available in the United States in 1947, Cox turned his attention to new products, beginning with a [[die-cast toy|diecast]] metal car.  This product was developed into a "whip car", a [[tether]]ed vehicle which could be manually swung in a circle at high speed.  [[nitromethane|Nitro]]- and gasoline-powered [[tether car]]s with .60 cubic inch miniature engines capable of speeds of 100&amp;nbsp;mph (160&amp;nbsp;km/h) were quickly becoming popular.  Cox's first contribution to that growing hobby was a cast aluminum midget racer powered by a .15 engine by Cameron Brothers.

Cox Manufacturing enjoyed a large postwar growth due in part to its production of miniature model [[Cox_model_engine|internal combustion engine]]s and [[control line]] [[Cox_model_engine#Cox_Ready_to_Fly_Model_Airplanes|model aircraft]], finally moving to a new factory in [[Santa Ana, California]], in 1963.  The factory started at 80,000 square feet (7432 square meters). Three expansions in a few years' time saw expansion to 225,000 square feet (20,903 square meters) and introduction of a line of [[slot car]]s, [[model rocket]]s, [[HO scale]] model trains, and a full-sized, one-horsepower gasoline-powered [[chain saw]].

[[Leroy_M._Cox|Roy Cox]] retired in 1969, and he sold the company to the hobby conglomerate "Leisure Dynamics". Kites, toy [[walkie-talkies]], and yo-yos were added to the Cox company products.  A major step toward participation in the growing [[radio control]]led hobby business happened in 1976 with the acquisition of the radio manufacturer "Airtronics". 

By 1983, Leisure Dynamics was facing bankruptcy. Their engineer William Selzer, the designer of the "Babe Bee" .049 aircraft engine, joined with a local businessman to purchase the Cox company.  The new company, Aeromil Engineering Company, changed the name of the company from Cox Company to Cox Hobbies, Incorporated, in 1984.  Growth of the company continued, but its factory space became fragmented since the operations were spread out over a number of leased buildings.  This prompted a move to a consolidated facility in [[Corona, California]], in 1990.  

In January 1996, a leading model toy rocket manufacturer, [[Estes Industries]], purchased Cox Hobbies, Incorporated, and relocated operations from Southern California to the Estes facility in Penrose, Colorado.  This signaled a major change in marketing direction for the new company, now known as Cox Models.  A great many new products were aimed towards a [[mass market]] and they were sold in large chain stores and discount stores.

In February 2009 Estes Industries sold all of their remaining old classic Cox stock to several private buyers from the USA and Canada, one of them being a small privately owned company from Canada. In June 2009 they launched a website [http://coxengines.ca Cox International] to sell their stock online and also via eBay.  Some of the former Cox model train line is now sold by the Wm. K. Walthers company.

In January 2010 Estes-Cox Corporation was purchased by [[Hobbico]] based in Champaign, Illinois. These are the official owners of the former Cox name and logo and the [http://www.coxmodels.com/index.html Cox Models] product line up consists of grand total of three basic [[Radio-controlled_aircraft|Radio controlled]] electric trainer model airplanes. 

To the present day [http://coxengines.ca Cox International] continue to revive the original classic Cox brand of [[Cox_model_engine|miniature aircraft engines]] as well as introducing new engine versions, reproduction parts, spare parts and accessories.

==Notable Cox engine toys==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cox model and engine advertisement.jpg|thumb|300px|Old Cox magazine or news paper advertisement, showing a disassembled view of the Babe Bee engine (as sold seperatly) and dramatized views of three ready to fly models.]] --&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s until recently, Cox has produced a line of hobby-oriented models of cars, airplanes, and other vehicles. The most noted are the [[Cox model engine|.049 cubic-inch]] displacement [[glow fuel]] powered models, controlled by line ([[Control Line]]) or by [[radio]] ([[Radio Control]]).

* [[Adam-12]] [[AMC Matador]] .049 engine police car
* T-28 Trojan airplane model
* The PT 19 flight trainer taught many people control line flying, without risking their own creations.  At least the early all-metal reed valve engines, with the rubber spinners that came on ready-to-fly models, survive crashes to be used later in balsa models, thus spreading the hobby and Cox's business.
* There were some odd-looking craft that resembled powered [[Frisbee]]s.
* Some [[control line]] models such as the [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider]] and some Ryan primary trainers had three control lines or some other form of throttle control, as well as elevator control.

==Cox engines==
[[Image:Old Cox Babe Bee engine dissasembled.JPG|thumb|200px|Early Cox Golden Bee disassembled. (Note that the crankcase has been user modified.)]]
[[Image:Cox reed valve assembled.JPG|thumb|150px|The same Golden Bee assembled.]]
[[Image:Cox Sure Start dissasembled.JPG|thumb|150px|Sure Start disassembled.]]

===Reed valve===

Cox reed valve engines are nearly indestructible.  The needle valve and carburettor are behind the cylinder where they are protected, and the crank case, cylinder and fuel tank are all machined from forgings, rather than weaker castings.  The tank back plate/carburettor is a zinc alloy casting, or later a plastic casting, but crash stresses are already well distributed by the time they reach it. The claim of dimensional tolerance, in the advertisement shown above, is justified by the facts that the high production volume engines need no break-in, except for a one-minute rich run, and any piston will fit into any cylinder that is the same size.

An example of an 0.049 cubic inch (0.8 cubic cm.) reed valve engine is shown on the right, taken apart (with the tools shown) and assembled. Except for the Golden Bee fuel tank, this engine was bought used in 1979.  The starter spring has been removed, allowing the use of a left hand screw propeller.  Some unneeded metal has been removed from the front of the crank case.

Below the Bee is a new Sure Start.  There are several superficial changes, including that the shape of the reed is different and it is now made of steel.  The most substantial change (not visible) is in the carburettor, which now has a large brass spray bar / barrier crossing the round barrel aperture, with a jet hole in its back center. The older carburettor has an abrupt increase in the diameter of the barrel (visible), with the jet at the top of the larger barrel section.

In addition to 0.049 cubic inch (0.80 cc) variants such as these, the 0.020 cubic inch (0.33 cc) Pee Wee was also sold, in large quantities and over several decades, in ready to fly or run models and separately to power other models.

[[Image:Cox TD 049.JPG|thumb|150px|Cox Tee Dee .049 on a tank mount.]]
The TDs (Tee Dee or Thimble Drome) had very high power for their size and ranged from 0.01&amp;nbsp;in³ (0.16&amp;nbsp;cc) to 0.09&amp;nbsp;in³ (1.5&amp;nbsp;cc) displacement.  They were for serious hobbyists and too temperamental for mass markets.
Note, on the Tee Dee shown, that light shows through the external ports, under the piston (sub induction). This engine cannot run properly with a muffler. Sub induction served to allow extra air into the cylinder at high engine speed. This increases the charge of mixture and makes the ignition timing track to engine speed to maintain power over a wider range of rpm.  The cylinder head shown is of the low compression Bee type.

Medallions were milder than the TDs but better performers than the reed valve engines.

The '''Digital Media Initiative''' (DMI) was a British [[broadcast engineering]] project launched by the [[BBC]] in 2008. It aimed to modernise the Corporation's production and archiving methods by using connected digital production and [[Digital asset management|media asset management]] systems. After a protracted [[Software development process|development process]] lasting five years with a spend of £98 million between 2010 and 2012, the project was finally abandoned in May 2013.&lt;ref name=bbc_abandons&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC abandons £100m digital project|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22651126|accessdate=25 May 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcpr-close&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC closes Digital Media Initiative|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/digital-media-initiative.html|accessdate=29 May 2013|date=24 May 2013|agency=BBC press release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial impetus and relaunch==
The technology programme was initiated by the director of BBC Technology [[Ashley Highfield]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=beta-bust /&gt; It aimed to streamline broadcast operations by moving to a fully digital, [[tapeless]] production workflow at a cost of £81.7 million. Forecast to deliver cost savings to the BBC of around £18 million, DMI was [[outsourcing|contracted out]] to the technology services provider [[Siemens IT Solutions and Services|Siemens]] with consulting by [[Deloitte]]. Among the production features to be provided by DMI were a media ingest system; a [[Digital asset management|media asset management]] system, unifying audio, video and stills archival; an online [[storyboard]]ing system; and [[metadata]] storage and sharing. A core part of the system was formed by using Cinegy, a production suite originally developed prior to the DMI project by the BBC and selected by Siemens in 2008.&lt;ref name=cinegy&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinegy &amp; Siemens, Enabling Media Technology for Digital Media Initiative at Major UK Broadcaster |url=http://www.cinegy.com/jml/index.php/en/news-mainmenu-141/news-archive-mainmenu-66/143-cinegy-a-siemens.html |work=Cinegy company website |accessdate=24 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209140231/http://www.cinegy.com/jml/index.php/en/news-mainmenu-141/news-archive-mainmenu-66/143-cinegy-a-siemens.html |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Austerberry&gt;{{cite book|last=Austerberry|first=David|title=Digital Asset Management|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1136033610|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DMI Programme Director was television producer and entrepreneur [[Raymond P. Le Gué]].

Costs of the project rose after a number of technical problems and delays, and in 2009 the BBC terminated its contract with Siemens.&lt;ref name=broadcast-dmi&gt;{{cite news|last=Rushton|first=Katherine|title=BBC ditches Siemens from £80m DMI scheme|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/broadcasters/bbc-ditches-siemens-from-80m-dmi-scheme/5008953.article|accessdate=15 February 2012|newspaper=Broadcast|date=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC losses were estimated to be £38.2m,&lt;ref name=ITProPortal-dmi&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Loses £38 Million In Failed Digital Media Initiative |url=http://www.itproportal.com/2011/04/07/bbc-loses-38-million-failed-digital-media-initiative/|work=ITProPortal|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  partially offset by a £27.5m settlement paid by Siemens, leaving a loss of £10.7m to the BBC. The BBC was criticised by the UK [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] (NAO) in 2011 for its handling of the project.&lt;ref name=guardian-dmi&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|title=BBC IT project criticised by audit office|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/01/bbc-it-audit-office|accessdate=15 February 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In evidence given to the NAO, the Director of the BBC's Future Media and Technology division, [[Erik Huggers]], stated that Siemens had been selected to run the project without a [[tendering]] process because the BBC already had a 10-year support contract with the company. He also remarked that transfer of [[Risk management|risk]] on the project to Siemens had resulted in a distant relationship with Siemens which made it hard to monitor project [[Milestone (project management)|milestone]]s and the completion of [[deliverable]]s.&lt;ref name=nao-evidence&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral evidence Taken before the Public Accounts Committee|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmpubacc/808/808.pdf|work=The BBC’s management of its Digital Media Initiative|publisher=House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts|page=20|date=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{centered pull quote|When we checked in with Siemens to look at, "Okay, where are these deliverables?

After the termination of the Siemens contract, the DMI project was [[Backsourcing|brought in-house]] by the BBC in 2009 and rebranded as ''Fabric''.&lt;ref name=bbc-dmi&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Media Initiative|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/careers/divisions/digital-media-initiative|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310041000/http://www.bbc.co.uk/careers/divisions/digital-media-initiative|archivedate=10 March 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=annualreport2010&gt;{{cite journal|title=Enabling the BBC|journal=BBC Annual Report 2009/10|date=16 August 2010|volume=Part 2: BBC Executive's review and assessment|page=2.44|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/bbc_executive_2009_10.pdf|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, it was reported that BBC staff who worked on a number of projects including DMI had suffered from severe [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] and had been treated at [[Priory Group|The Priory]].&lt;ref name=telegraph-dmi&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC spends £19,000 treating stressed out staff at The Priory|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9074284/BBC-spends-19000-treating-stressed-out-staff-at-The-Priory.html|accessdate=15 February 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=11 February 2012|location=London|first=Katherine|last=Rushton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments in 2013-14==
According to a report in ''The Guardian'', problems emerged in April 2013 during the coverage by [[BBC News]] of the [[death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher]]. News staff, attempting to source material on [[analog recording|analog]] [[videotape]] from the [[BBC Archives]], were unable to [[Digital reformatting|transfer footage to digital format]] due to the huge demand for limited transfer facilities at the newly refurbished [[Broadcasting House#Second phase|New Broadcasting House]] in central London. Requested tapes were reportedly transported around London by taxi and via the [[London Underground|Tube]], and video transfer work was carried out by external production companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC's Thatcher coverage highlights problems with non-digital archives|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/11/bbc-thatcher-coverage|accessdate=3 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 February 2012|location=London|first=Tara|last=Conlan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later it emerged that tape editing equipment might have to be installed at Broadcasting House in specially cooled areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC's troubled £133m digital video archive delays 'tapeless' future|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/may/03/bbc-digital-video-archive|accessdate=3 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 May 2013|location=London|first=Tara|last=Conlan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May 2013 the [[Director-General of the BBC]], [[Tony Hall, Baron Hall of Birkenhead|Lord Hall]], announced that the project was to be abandoned and that the BBC's [[chief technology officer]], [[John Linwood (BBC)|John Linwood]], was to be suspended pending an external investigation into the management of the DMI project.&lt;ref name=bbc_abandons /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcpr-close /&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian_axe&gt;{{cite news|last=Conlan|first=Tara|title=BBC axes £98m technology project to avoid 'throwing good money after bad'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/may/24/bbc-technology-project-digital-media-initiative|accessdate=25 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently revealed that a senior BBC manager had expressed grave doubts about DMI to the BBC Chairman [[Chris Patten|Lord Patten]] one year before the project was cancelled. He had also claimed that there was a "very significant risk" that the National Audit Office had been misled about the actual progress of DMI in 2011. Other BBC executives had also voiced similar concerns for about two years before DMI was abandoned.&lt;ref name=guardian-patten&gt;{{cite news|last=Conlan|first=Tara|title=BBC Digital Media Initiative project doomed to failure, Lord Patten was told|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/05/bbc-digital-media-initiative-failure-patten|accessdate=5 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAO commenced an inquiry into the failure of the project and commissioned accountancy firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] to carry out an investigation. At a hearing held on 10 June 2013 at the BBC's [[MediaCityUK]] site in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], MPs [[Margaret Hodge]] and [[Stewart Jackson]] commented on evidence given by the then Director General [[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]] to the NAO in 2011 and to the BBC Trust, and took the view that he had misled the enquiry. BBC Trust member [[Anthony Fry (business executive)|Anthony Fry]] remarked that the DMI had been a "complete catastrophe" and said that the project was "probably the most serious, embarrassing thing I have ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=BBC accused of misleading parliament over 'catastrophic' digital media project|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/10/bbc-chiefs-accused-misleading-parliament|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Revoir|first=Paul|title=BBC boss 'misled' MPs about £100m IT fiasco: Senior Labour backbencher accuses Mark Thompson of failing to 'tell the truth' |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2339283/BBC-boss-misled-MPs-100m-IT-fiasco-Senior-Labour-backbencher-accuses-Mark-Thompson-failing-tell-truth.html|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2014, the BBC confirmed that the contract of former technology chief John Linwood  had been terminated the  previous July due to the failure of the Digital Media Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25886417 "Former BBC technology boss sacked over failed project"], ‘’BBC’’, 24 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 April 2014, the House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts presented the "BBC Digital Media Initiative, Fifty-second Report of Session 2013–14" in which it defines the project as a "complete failure" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news/bbc-dmi-report-substantive/ "BBC's Digital Media Initiative a complete failure"], ‘’BBC’’, 10 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eightball''''' is a [[comic book]] by [[Daniel Clowes]] and published by [[Fantagraphics Books]].  It ran from 1989 to 2004.  The first issue appeared soon after the end of Clowes's previous comic book, ''[[Lloyd Llewellyn]]''.  ''Eightball'' has been among the best-selling series in [[alternative comics]].

Early issues of ''Eightball'' feature a mixture of very short, often crudely humorous comics ("Zubrick and Pogeybait", "[[The Sensual Santa]]"), topical rants and [[satire]]s ("[[Art School Confidential (comic)|Art School Confidential]]", "On Sports"), longer, more reflective self-contained stories ("Caricature", "Immortal Invisible"), and [[Serial (literature)|serial]]ized works. The first extended story serialized in ''Eightball'' was ''[[Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron]]'', which ran in issues #1–10. ''Glove'' was followed by ''[[Ghost World]]'' (issues #11–18). Beginning with #19 each issue of ''Eightball'' has been devoted to a single storyline, as opposed to the more eclectic format of the earlier issues. Issues #19–21 serialized the graphic novel ''[[David Boring]]'', while issues #22 and 23 each consisted of a collection of short, fragmentary stories in diverse styles and formats that meshed into a unified narrative ("[[Ice Haven]]" and "[[The Death Ray (comics)|The Death Ray]]"). The issues of ''Eightball'' beginning with #19 have been published in full color in a larger [[magazine]]-sized format.  ''Eightball'' #18 included a bound-in copy of Clowes's [[pamphlet]] ''[[Modern Cartoonist]]''.

| "Velvet Glove" is a parody of bad film adaptations, using the just-completed ''Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron'' as its source, with behind-the-scenes segments showing an increasingly anxious Clowes in talks with a clueless Hollywood producer, and scenes from the resulting movie, in which Clay is a tough, sarcastic police detective who plays by his own rules and makes pithy remarks (such as "what are you lookin' at?") before shooting his enemies. Tina is recast as a space alien who gives "Clay" a ring of power.

==Film adaptations==
''Ghost World'' was adapted by Clowes and director [[Terry Zwigoff]] into a [[Ghost World (film)|2001 feature film of the same name]], for which Clowes and Zwigoff were nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for screenplay writing. Additionally, the 2006 Clowes/Zwigoff film ''[[Art School Confidential (film)|Art School Confidential]]'' was loosely based on a [[Art School Confidential (comic)|short story of the same name]] which appeared in ''Eightball'' #7.  

==Controversy==
The comic generated controversy when a high school teacher in [[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]], [[Connecticut]] gave ''Eightball'' #22 (''[[Ice Haven]]'') to a student as a make-up summer reading assignment. The parents of the student had concerns about the book's appropriateness. The superintendent of [[Guilford High School (Connecticut)|Guilford High School]] said the book was inappropriate for 13-year-olds and placed the teacher on leave. The teacher resigned before the matter was fully investigated.&lt;ref name="new haven register"&gt;{{cite news | title = Handling of teacher, comic issue riles parents | work = New Haven Advocate| last = Arnott | first = Christopher | date =2007-09-27 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=12DC1E3755C82818&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;s_dlid=DL0111011311065815231&amp;s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&amp;s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&amp;s_trackval=&amp;s_siteloc=&amp;s_referrer=&amp;s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F14%2F2015%2011%3A59%20PM&amp;s_docsbal=%20&amp;s_subexpires=12%2F14%2F2015%2011%3A59%20PM&amp;s_docstart=&amp;s_docsleft=&amp;s_docsread=&amp;s_username=freeuser&amp;s_accountid=AC0107071613143204025&amp;s_upgradeable=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guilford school district and principal were criticized for getting police involved and trying the issue in a "kangaroo court".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drumsnwhistles.com/2007/09/30/nate-fisher-a-connecticut-teacher-in-a-kangaroo-court/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Cóndor Pasa''' ({{IPA-es|el ˈkondoɾ pasa|pron}}, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "The [[Andean condor|Condor]] Passes") is an [[orchestra]]l [[musical composition|musical piece]] from the [[zarzuela]] ''[[El Cóndor Pasa (play)|El Cóndor Pasa]]'' by the [[Peru]]vian composer [[Daniel Alomía Robles]], written in 1913 and based on traditional [[Andean music]], specifically [[folk music]] from [[music of Peru|Peru]].

Since then, it has been estimated that around the world, more than 4000 versions of the melody have been produced, along with 300 sets of lyrics. In 2004, Peru declared this song as part of the national cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinoamerica-online.info/cult04/musica06.04.html |title=musica musique musica |website=Latinoamerica-online.info |date=2004-04-13 |accessdate=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This song is now considered the second national anthem of Peru.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

It is the best-known Peruvian song in the English-speaking world due to a 1970 cover by [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]] on their ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' album. Their version is called "'''El Cóndor Pasa (If I Could)'''".

==Original zarzuela version==
In 1913, Peruvian songwriter [[Daniel Alomía Robles]] composed "El Cóndor Pasa", and the song was first performed publicly at the Teatro Mazzi in [[Lima]].&lt;ref name=PCOLRepublica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acuarela.se/ElCondorPasa.htm |title="El Cóndor Pasa" patrimonio cultural de la nación |website=Acuarela.se |accessdate=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was originally a musical piece in the Peruvian zarzuela (musical play), ''[[El cóndor pasa (zarzuela)|El cóndor pasa]]''.

Its music was composed by Daniel Alomía Robles in 1913 and its script was written by Julio de La Paz (pseudonym of the Limenian dramatist Julio Baudouin). The piano arrangement of this play's most famous melody was legally registered on May 3, 1933 by The Edward B. Marks Music Corp. in the [[Library of Congress]], under the number 9643. The zarzuela is written in prose and consists of one musical play and two acts.

In July 2013, the Colectivo Cultural Centenario El Cóndor Pasa cultural association re-edited the original script which had been lost for a period of time, and published it together with a CD containing the recorded dialogues and seven musical pieces. The music from the original score was reconstructed by musicologist Luis Salazar Mejía with the collaboration of musicians Daniel Dorival and Claude Ferrier and the support of cultural promoter Mario Cerrón Fetta, and re-released on November 14, 15, and 16, 2013 at the Teatro UNI in Lima to celebrate its first centenary. The zarzuela included the famous homonymous melody, without lyrics, based on the traditional Andean music of Peru, where it was declared a National Cultural Heritage in 2004.

}}

In 1965, the American musician [[Paul Simon]] heard for the first time a version of the melody by the band [[Los Incas]] in a performance at the ''Théâtre de l'Est parisien'' in Paris in which both were participating. Simon became friendly with [[Los Incas]] band, later even touring with them and producing their first US-American album. He asked the band for permission to use the song in his production. The band's director and founding member [[Jorge Milchberg]], who was collecting royalties for the song as co-author and arranger, responded erroneously that it was a traditional Peruvian composition. Milchberg told Simon he was registered as the arrangement's co-author and collected royalties.

In 1970, the [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]] duo covered the Los Incas version, adding some English lyrics which in turn added Paul Simon to the author credits under the song name "El Cóndor Pasa (If I Could)". The instrumental version by Los Incas was used as the base track. They included the song on the 1970 album ''[[Bridge Over Troubled Water]]''. Simon &amp; Garfunkel released their version as a single in the U.S., which reached #18 on the [[Billboard Pop Singles]] chart and #6 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary|Easy Listening]] chart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961–2001|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2002 |publisher=Record Research |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fall 1970. This cover achieved major international success and fame.

In regard to the Simon &amp; Garfunkel version, [[Daniel Alomía Robles]], Jorge Milchberg, and Paul Simon are now all listed as songwriters, with Simon listed alone as the author of the English lyrics. However, Daniel Alomía Robles was not originally listed as the composer because Jorge Milchberg had told Simon that the song was considered an Andean folk melody. He further stated that he was the registered co-author and arranger of the composition.

===Copyright lawsuit===
In late 1970, Daniel Alomía Robles' son [[Armando Robles Godoy]], a Peruvian filmmaker, filed a successful copyright lawsuit against Paul Simon. The grounds for the lawsuit extended that the song had been composed by his father, who had copyrighted the song in the United States in 1933.&lt;ref name=PCOLRepublica/&gt; Armando Robles Godoy said that he held no ill will towards Paul Simon for what he considered a "misunderstanding" and an "honest mistake".&lt;ref name=PCOLElcine&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.diariolaprimeraperu.com/online/semana/images/ediciones/pdf/6/6-4.pdf |title=El cine, los libros, la muerte (an interview with Armando Robles Godoy) |language=Spanish |journal=Diario La Primera |author=Juan Carlos Bondy |date=July 6, 2008 |accessdate=2011-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710123034/http://www.diariolaprimeraperu.com/online/semana/images/ediciones/pdf/6/6-4.pdf |archivedate=July 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It was an almost friendly court case because Paul Simon was very respectful of other cultures. It was not carelessness on his part," said Armando Robles Godoy.&lt;ref name=PCOLElcine/&gt; "He happened to hear the song in Paris from a vernacular group Los Incas. He liked it, he went to ask the band for permission and they gave him the wrong information. Jorge Milchberg told him it was a traditional folk song from the 18th century and not my father's composition. It was a court case without further complications."&lt;ref name=PCOLElcine/&gt;

Later that year, [[Perry Como]] released a cover of Paul Simon's English version on his album ''[[It's Impossible (album)|It's Impossible]]'', while [[Julie Felix]] had a UK Top 20 hit with it, taking advantage of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's decision not to release their version as a UK single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kokomo.ca/cd_review/cd_finder/el_condor_pasa_cd_finder.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126073452/http://kokomo.ca/cd_review/cd_finder/el_condor_pasa_cd_finder.htm |archivedate=November 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armando Robles Godoy subsequently wrote new Spanish lyrics for the song, taking Paul Simon's version as a reference.

In [[game theory]] and in particular the study of [[Blotto games]] and [[operational research]], the '''Gibbs lemma''' is a result that is useful in maximization problems.&lt;ref name="Danskin2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

Consider &lt;math&gt;\phi=\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''J &amp; L Randall Ltd''' was a [[UK|British]] toy manufacturer, based in [[Potters Bar]], which was in [[Middlesex]] until 1965 and then in [[Hertfordshire]].  The company flourished in the 1950s and  1960s and placed regular advertisements in [[Meccano Magazine]].  It was one of the main competitors to [[Mamod]] for models of stationary steam engines.

The company used two trading names:

* '''Merit''' for general toys
* '''SEL''' (Signalling Equipment Ltd) for technical toys, e.g. [[electric motors]], [[Model steam engine|steam engines]] and [[student microscope]]s. It is believed that the term "signalling equipment" originally related to items such as [[Telegraph key|Morse keys]] and [[Telegraph sounder|sounders]].

In 1978 the company was bought by [[Letraset]] for 12.5 million pounds.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company no longer exists but some of the products, especially the steam engines have become [[collectable|collectors' items]].

==Products==
The company made a wide range of toys under both brand names. The catalogue&lt;ref&gt;J &amp; L Randall Ltd. Combined Merit and SEL catalogue. Undated but probably c1960&lt;/ref&gt; contained hundreds of items at their peak. Nowadays, they are best known for the SEL range, especially the steam engines, dynamotor and student's microscopes.
[[File:Signalling Equipment Limited 1550 major static engine.ogv|thumb|Signalling Equipment Limited 1550 major static engine begins to run]]

===Steam engines===
[[File:Rew12g22-345 SEL range of steam engines.JPG|thumb|Examples of all 5 of Signalling Equipment Ltd steam engines. Back row L-R - 1520 Minor, 1530 Junior, 1540 Standard, 1550 Major. Front 1560 Boat engine]]
The steam engine range consisted of four [[stationary engines]], and a steam engine unit for model boats. The stationary engines were the Minor, Junior, Standard and Major.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lesmarsh.webs.com/selengines.htm SEL Steam Engines] at "Bucket of Steam"&lt;/ref&gt; The major could also be bought complete with a set of miniature workshop tools.
When the steam engine line was brought to an end in 1965, remaining stocks of the model boat engine were bought up by [[Mamod]] and used for their [[mamod#ME1, ME2 and ME3 Marine Steam Engines|ME3 "marine engine"]].

===Dynamotor===
The SEL "Dynamotor" was a simple two-pole, [[Magnet|permanent magnet]], machine which could be run as a [[Electric motor|motor]] (using 4-6 [[volt]]s from a [[Dry cell|dry battery]]) or used as a [[Electrical generator|dynamo]]. There were also four low voltage motors described in the catalogue just as motors. Three of these were ac/dc so could not be used as dynamos but the fourth was a dc only permanent magnet type which could have been used as a dynamo. There was also a range of mains voltage ac/dc motors which could not, by any means, be considered toys.
  
[[File:Rew12g22-349 SEL Student's Microscope.JPG|thumb|SEL Student's Microscope with wooden box containing a drawer for glass slides. Other accessories are missing.]]
===Student's microscopes===
There were several models of microscope, all similar in design but differing in size.  They were simple but well made instruments with sturdy cast alloy frames.  They were supplied in a wooden or cardboard box complete with several glass slides, tweezers and instruction leaflet.

'''Jachigi'''(자치기) is a South Korean [[game]] where a long stick and two short sticks is hit and [[caught]]. First, a circular hole is dug on the ground, and a circle is drawn on the outside. After placing a short stick around the outside of the hole, it is hit with the long stick, and the rebounding stick (the short one that was just hit), is hit again with the long stick in mid-air, sending it flying far away.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/SearchNavi?keyword=%EC%9E%90%EC%B9%98%EA%B8%B0&amp;ridx=0&amp;tot=3|title=자치기 - 한국민족문화대백과사전|website=encykorea.aks.ac.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Jachigi or ja chigi is said to have originated from the game called ''gyeokgu'', a popular sport in ancient [[Goryeo]] used for military purposes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Korea's Pastimes and Customs: A Social History|last=Lee|first=E-Wha|publisher=Homa &amp; Sekey Books|year=2006|isbn=1931907382|location=Paramus, NJ|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involved two teams holding sticks, which were used to shoot a ball in between two goal posts set up in the middle of a ''gyeokgu'' field. The game resembled the modern-day [[field hockey]] sport especially as it was also played on horseback. It was, however, included in the military service examination and training in the [[Joseon]] period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The advent of modern warfare, particularly after Joseon's war with Japan, made the ''gyeokgu'' irrelevant in armed combat and from then on, it transformed into simpler forms and spread across Korea as popular children's games. It was the basis of the shuttlecock-kicking game and the jachigi. The jachigi game denotes measuring with a stick and hitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanese Imperialism: Politics and Sport in East Asia: Rejection, Resentment, Revanchism|last=Mangan|first=J.A.|last2=Horton|first2=Peter|last3=Ren|first3=Tianwei|last4=Ok|first4=Gwang|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2017|isbn=9789811051036|location=Singapore|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ja'' means wooden stick, while ''chigi'' means measuring distance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To play effectively, the stick should be about 30 centimeters long and the shorter stick must be 7 centimeters.

== How to play Jachigi ==
The rules are to first divide two or more people into two teams, either the [[Offense (sports)|offensive]] area or the [[Defense (sports)|defensive]] area. The offensive side hits the stick and lets it fly; if the opposing team catches it, the offense and the defense switch sides. If there were only two people playing, the player who hit the stick would lose. In the case that it could not be caught, the opposing team picks up the short stick, and throws it toward the hole. Then, the offensive person hits it back. Where the short stick fell, they measure with the long stick. Right then, the long stick becomes one ruler. The name Jachigi is used because of the use of the long stick as a [[ruler]] to determine the winner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The longer the distance measured, the higher the score.

'''''Kickboxer 3: The Art of War''''' (stylized as '''''Kickboxer III: The Art of War''''' on the opening title card) is a 1992 direct-to-video martial arts film directed by Rick King. The film is the third in the [[Kickboxer (film series)|''Kickboxer'' franchise]] with only Sasha Mitchell and Dennis Chan returning from the previous films. It was also the last film to feature Dennis Chan as Xian Chow and first entry into the series to be released direct-to-video.

==Plot==
The movie opens with a distressed woman being chased through a tropical forest by an unknown pursuer. It is soon revealed that the woman is attempting to escape from Frank Lane, an American running an illegal child sex ring operation in Brazil. Upon being recaptured, she is taken back to Lane's home and executed in front of the other slaves, as punishment for her actions.

Meanwhile, kickboxing champion David Sloane and his trainer Xian arrive in [[Rio de Janeiro]] for a championship bout. Though Xian is mostly interested in training for the upcoming fight, Sloane dismisses the idea in favor of relaxing in the city. While eating lunch, their camera is suddenly stolen by a young thief, and Sloane immediately gives chase. After fending off a pair of drunken assailants, he catches up to the boy who then brandishes a knife, but Sloane easily disarms him and takes back the camera. When the boy, Marcos, follows him back to the restaurant to reclaim the knife, Xian invites both him and his beautiful sister Isabella to join them for lunch, and they eventually become friends.

At a charity kickboxing event, Sloane is asked to be the cornerman for another young fighter in an exhibition match against Eric Martine, an Argentine kickboxer managed by Lane, who also happens to be Sloane's opponent for the upcoming championship fight. However, an aggressive Martine brutally beats the young fighter, prompting Sloane to physically intervene on his behalf. As a result, Sloane's bout with Martine is billed as a grudge match. Lane apologizes to Sloane for Martine's actions and invites him to a party he is hosting.

Sloane attends the party with Marcos and Isabella as his personal guests. Upon meeting her, Lane becomes infatuated with Isabella. When Sloane parts ways with the children for the night, Lane secretly sends out a group of men to kidnap her. In a panic, Marcos asks for Sloane's help and they file a police report, but with an overwhelming backlog of unsolved cases on their hands, the authorities do not consider their case a priority and advise them to simply forget about Isabella.

Undeterred, Sloane and Xian launch their own investigation, which ultimately leads to their arrest. Although Lane bails them out in an attempt to cover his tracks, the two continue their search, only to find that the trail leads right back to him. They confront Lane in his home, but are ambushed and taken prisoner. Lane forces Sloane through a series of grueling exercises designed to weaken him before his match with Martine, such as hiking with a backpack full of rocks and water-skiing without skis. He then releases both men back to their hotel, with the condition that if Sloane doesn't show up for the fight, Isabella will disappear forever. With Marcos's help, Xian is able to create and administer a cure for Sloane's fatigue.

At the fight, Sloane manages to defeat Martine, and Xian is successful in rescuing Isabella before Lane can flee the arena leaving Lane bankrupt. Upon being reunited with Marcos, Isabella tells him about the other girls Lane has imprisoned, and Sloane resolves to free them as well. In retaliation, Lane pulls a gun on Sloane intending to shoot him, but Marcos suddenly appears and stabs Lane in the stomach with his knife.

In the end, the police sergeant decides to cover up Lane's murder, and Sloane arranges for Marcos and Isabella to attend school. Upon realizing that they have missed their flight back home, Sloane, Xian, and the police sergeant decide to go out for drinks together.

==Production==

In an interview with Sam Weisberg for the web site Hidden Films, director Rick King said working with Sasha Mitchell was extremely difficult, with frequent temper tantrums and even threats of violence. “I think he thought people thought he was stupid, which was true,” King [said]. “And he was also violent, and so he used his position of privilege as the star in a very negative way.” &lt;ref name="Hidden Films"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://hidden-films.com/2013/05/28/without-him-thered-be-no-point-break-the-diverse-work-of-filmmaker-rick-king/|title=Hidden-Films.com – Article about Rick King|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theater in City of Kragujevac that bears the name of the father of first Serbian theater Joakim Vujic has developed its repertoire and staged performances and turned into modern contemporary theater.

First theater performances are staged in 1825 by the teacher Djordje Evgenijevic and his pupils. During his second visit to Kragujevac Joakim Vujic worked together with them.

He was very soon appointed Director of the Theater with the task to organize theater work.

Knjazesko Srbski Teatar – First Serbian Court Theater was placed within the adapted premises of typography and it was a building with the stage, boxes and ground floor. The repertoire of the theater consisted mainly of his plays while the theater ensemble beside Vujic as a leading actor and director consisted of secondary school pupils and adult amateurs.

First performances were staged in the period of February 2–4, 1935 when the so-called Sretenje (the Visitation of the Virgin) Assembly sessions were held. These were mostly Vujic's plays performed for the Grand Duke and his family and the representatives of the people i.e. members of Assembly; the music was composed by Jozef Slezinger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joakimvujic.com/english.php Knjaževsko-srpski teatar, About Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Greek dances}}

The following is a list with the most notable dances. Names of many Greek dances may be found spelt either ending with '''-o''' or with '''-os'''. This is due to the fact that the word for "dance" in [[Greek language|Greek]] is a masculine noun, while the dance itself can also be referred to by a neuter [[adjective]] used [[substantive]]ly. Thus one may find both "hasapiko" ("the butcher thing") and "hasapikos (horos)" - "the butcher (dance)."

The game features many of Michael Jackson's hits, such as "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]", "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]", "[[Beat It]]", "[[Billie Jean]]", "[[Smooth Criminal]]", "[[Black or White]]", "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]", etc. Initial launches of the game included a limited edition replica of Jackson's sequined glove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joystickdivision.com/2010/11/michael_jackson_the_experience_1.php |title=Michael Jackson: The Experience Launches With Limited truee Edition Glove |date=November 2, 2010 |last=Winslett |first=Ryan |work=Joystickdivision.com |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]], [[iOS]] and [[PlayStation Vita]].

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Michael Jackson Experience Kinect.jpg|320px|thumbnail|The Kinect version of the game includes full body motion technology and judges on how well the moves are done.]]

The Wii, PS3, and Kinect versions of the game feature Just Dance style gameplay. There are three modes of play in both the Wii and PS3 version of the game. The first is "Classic" where everybody follows the on-screen Michael Jackson avatar. The second is "Duo" which is used for duets (such as "[[The Girl Is Mine]]") or videos with two main characters (such as "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]" and "[[In the Closet]]") The player(s) can choose to dance as either Michael or the other character. The third mode of gameplay is "Crew", which features Michael and two backup dancers (five during some songs.) Players can opt to dance as any of the three. After performing songs, players are able to unlock training videos in the "Dance School" where they are taught some of the more difficult moves from several of Michael Jackson's music videos and stage performances.

Four player multiplayer is available on the Wii and Move enabled PlayStation 3 but the Kinect will be limited to one player at a time. The game also features singing on the Kinect version on Xbox 360, and optional on-screen lyrics on the PlayStation 3 and Wii versions which also feature singing. The DS version features gameplay similar to [[Elite Beat Agents]]. In this version, there is a cartoon version of Michael on the top screen and the player follows along by tapping the bottom screen with the stylus to the rhythm of the music. Also on Nintendo DS version, there is an anti-piracy feature created by [[Ubisoft]] that will freeze the game and replace the audio with the sound of [[vuvuzela]]s (popularized by the [[South Africa]]ns in [[FIFA World Cup 2010|World Cup 2010]]) if the player is playing a pirated or ROM version of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Justin|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/29/eight-of-the-most-hilarious-anti-piracy-measures-in-video-games|title=Eight of the Most Hilarious Anti-Piracy Measures in Video Games|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=April 29, 2013|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the Wii version, players can play as Jackson or the Back-up Dancers. The game was displayed at New York Comic Con at Ubisoft's booth.

== Kinect features ==
The Kinect version of the game features full body tracking, and entirely different choreography to the Wii version,&lt;ref name="Everybody Plays MJ Kinect Features"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everybodyplays.co.uk/preview/360/Michael-Jackson-The-Experience-Kinect-Hands-On/525 |title=Michael Jackson: The Experience (Kinect) Hands-On |work=Everybodyplays.co.uk |accessdate=May 31, 2011 |date=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with several other changes and additions. This version uses a technology called Player Projection, which puts the player's own image in the game allowing them to star in their own Michael Jackson video. The Kinect version includes two game modes: "Solo" and "Party". Solo mode features one player. Party mode features 2-4 players. There are two options in Party mode: "Co-Op" and "Battle". Co-Op mode is a "every player for themselves" mode as players take turns jumping in and jumping out in order to complete the song. Battle mode is a team mode where two teams face off to get the highest score. Battle mode is a little different from Co-Op mode as each team performs the song together and the song gets broken down into two parts in which one player dances and the other player sings. Party mode only features Dance Mode, Performance Mode and Master Performance Mode. There are four symbols to represent each player: Michael's glove, Michael's hat, Michael's shades and one of Michael's jackets. Several of the songs in the game do not feature any moves to perform, instead becoming "Singing Only" songs, with "[[Earth Song]]" being the first song confirmed as Singing Only. There are certain songs that have moves that can be taught in a practice mode called "MJ School". During each performance, a crown pops up above the player's head and the player must hit the crown to activate "King Power" before it fades away. The crown, appearing only once per song, will multiply the score by 8. Similar to the Wii version, the player is scored on how well they sing and dance. The player can get five different grades: "Perfect", "Good" and "OK" increases the player's score, while "Almost" and "Miss" make causes the player to lose their current score. Points add up at the end of each song along with the rating of stars the player receives and a photo the player takes during their performance. Players can either use the Kinect's built-in microphone or an attached mic/headset to sing.&lt;ref name="Everybody Plays MJ Kinect Features"/&gt; The game does include the option, however, to choose a "Dance Only" version of the song, which means the player will not be asked to sing.&lt;ref name="Everybody Plays MJ Kinect Features"/&gt; The Kinect version also features a mode known as Master Performance, which requires the player to both sing and dance to a set of choreographed moves that are harder than the normal moves, and "as close as possible to the videos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everybodyplays.co.uk/feature/360/Michael-Jackson-The-Experience-Kinect-Interview/524 |title=Michael Jackson: The Experience (Kinect) Interview |date=March 12, 2011 |work=Everybodyplays.co.uk |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PlayStation 3 and Vita features==
In addition to the singing and dancing functionalities found in the Xbox 360 version, the PlayStation 3 version allows the player to sing or dance at the same time as other players.&lt;ref name="eurog"&gt;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-04-25-michael-jackson-the-experience-review&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the option to record the video clips or take pictures of the player's performance, and allows the player to save or upload them to sites, such as [[Facebook]]. The PlayStation Vita version was ported with Improved graphics in HD, Multiplayer (AD-Hoc), Trophy Support, Motion Sensor support, Multi-touch support, and instead of taking off the On-screen notes, it was replaced with the ability to use the Rear touch pad for an even harder challenge and since its use the multi-touch, the difficulty has been given an upgrade to increase the challenge. The PS Vita version, compared to the 3DS version, has been given a whole new look in graphics and on resolution, with the player being able to use their finger instead of a 3DS stylus. The Vita version doesn't have any [[downloadable content]].

* A "*" indicates that there is a dance teaching video of that song.
* A "**" indicates that there is a three-part dance teaching video of that song.

In the Wii console version of the game, "Money" is incorrectly credited as a song from the album ''[[Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix]]'' which was released in 1997. This would be true if the song in the game was the remix but it is the original version of the song, released on ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]]'' in 1995.

==Development==
Roughly two weeks after Michael Jackson's death in 2009, MJ Productions announced that a Michael Jackson game had been in development for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3175132 |title=New Michael Jackson Game Reportedly Under Development |accessdate=2009-07-11 |work=[[1UP.com]] |date=July 10, 2009 |first=Kat|last=Bailey |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121012045624/http://www.1up.com/news/michael-jackson-game-reportedly-development |archivedate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Michael Jackson Experience was met with generally positive reviews, with most of them citing the varied differences between the different versions of the game. The reviews for the DS and PSP versions were above average, with a slightly better score for the DS version. [[IGN]] gave a 6.5/10 for DS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/113/1138952p1.html |title=Michael Jackson: The Experience Nintendo DS |date=December 7, 2010 |last=Clements |first=Ryan |work=[[IGN.com]] |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 5.5/10 for the PSP.&lt;ref name=IGNpspreview /&gt; [[Destructoid]] gave a 6/10 for the DS version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-michael-jackson-the-experience-ds--189144.phtml |title=Review: Michael Jackson: The Experience (DS) |date=December 10, 2010 |last=Holmes |first=Jonathan |work=[[Destructoid]].com |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]] gave the Wii version a 3.5 saying that it does not give clear instructions on how to dance and also criticized the controls.&lt;ref name=IGNpspreview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.psp.ign.com/articles/113/1138754p1.html |title=Michael Jackson: The Experience Review |date=December 6, 2010 |last=Clements |first=Ryan |work=[[IGN.com]] |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] gave it 5/10, describing it as "perfectly good party fun if you don’t care that the controls don't work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/games/848417-games-review-michael-jackson-the-experience-is-bad |title=Games review – Michael Jackson: The Experience is bad |date=November 25, 2010 |last=Hargreaves |first=Roger |work=[[Metro.co.uk]] |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game received positive reviews from tabloids that had previously been anti-Jackson.&lt;ref name="sunrev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="starrev" /&gt; [[Videogamer.com]] gave the review a 7/10, stating that the music overplays the responsiveness difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamer.com/wii/michael_jackson_the_game/review.html |title=Michael Jackson The Game Review |date=November 6, 2010 |last=Smith |first=Jamin |work=[[Videogamer.com]] |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNET]] gave the game 5/5, writing that the game is "extremely easy to pick up and play" and "the choreography is amazing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/wii-games/michael-jackson-the-experience/4505-9993_7-34130706.html?part=cnet&amp;subj=Michael+Jackson+The+Experience+(Wii)#reviewPage1 |title=Michael Jackson The Experience (Wii) |date=December 10, 2010 |last=Walton |first=Mark |publisher=[[CNET.com]] |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] gave the game 4/5, noting that the game "is not meant to be played by yourself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/8389-Review-Michael-Jackson-The-Experience.2 |title=Review: Michael Jackson The Experience |date=December 1, 2010 |last=Tito |first=Greg |page=2 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapistmagazine.com]] |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurogamer thought that the Xbox dance routines "feel a little slower and more simplistic than those in the PS3 game",&lt;ref name="eurog" /&gt; while the [[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]] said that "the Move seems a touch more sensitive".&lt;ref name="starrev" /&gt;

The '''New Zealand Film Commission''' (NZFC, ''Te Tumu Whakaata Taonga'' in [[Maori language|Maori]]) is a [[New Zealand]] government agency formed to assist with creating and promoting New Zealand [[films]]. It was established under the New Zealand [[Film Commission]] Act 1978 (as amended in 1981, 1985, 1988, 1994 and 1999).

==Functions and responsibilities==
The New Zealand Film Commission is a Crown entity working to grow the New Zealand film industry. Their statutory responsibility is to encourage, participate and assist in the making, promotion, distribution and exhibition of films made in New Zealand.

Through the financing and administration of incentive schemes they have been involved in more than 300 feature films including ''[[Boy]]'', ''[[Goodbye Pork Pie]]'', ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[Avatar]]'', ''[[Whale Rider]]'' and ''[[Mr Pip]]''.

===Film financing and marketing===
The NZFC assists New Zealand filmmakers by providing grants, loans and equity financing in the development and production of feature films and short films. They administer the Government's Large Budget Screen Production Grant (LBSPG) and Screen Production Incentive Fund (SPIF) and certify New Zealand films for tax purposes and co-productions. They also actively market New Zealand films and filmmakers, and organise high-profile New Zealand participation at major international film festivals and markets. They help with training and career development within the industry by partnering with other industry organisations.

The New Zealand Film Commission often works in conjunction with other government agencies, such as the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Ministry for Tourism and the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment.

====Films funded by the Commission====
The page [[List of New Zealand Feature Films]] shows which were funded by the commission.

===Film On Demand===
In 2014 the New Zealand Film Commission launched a transactional video on demand service, [https://ondemand.nzfilm.co.nz/#!/home NZ Film On Demand]. The site features NZ films for rent and purchase, with a library of films that will grow over time.

The '''Piers Plowman tradition''' is made up of about 14 different poetic and prose works from about the time of [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] (died 1381) and the [[Peasants Revolt]] of 1381 through the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and beyond. All the works feature one or more characters, typically Piers, from [[William Langland]]'s poem ''[[Piers Plowman]]''. (A much larger number of texts, with less obvious connection to Piers Plowman, may also be considered part of the tradition.) Because the Plowman appears in the ''General Prologue'' to ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] but does not have his own tale (one of seven such characters), plowman tales are sometimes used as [[The_Canterbury_Tales#Literary_additions_and_supplements|additions to ''The Canterbury Tales'']], or otherwise conflated or associated with Chaucer.

As a rule, they satirically reflect economic, social, political, and religious grievances, and are concerned with political decisions and the relation between [[commoners]] and king. In these respects they resemble works such as ''[[Poem on the Evil Times of Edward II]]'' (1321–27), ''The Song of the Husbandman'' (c. 1340), ''[[Wynnere and Wastoure]]'' (c. 1353), and ''The Parlement of the Three Ages'' (c. 1375-1400). The Piers Plowman tradition therefore contributed to an emerging [[early modern]] "[[public sphere]]". Most of the works of the tradition are anonymous; many are pseudepigraphic by authorial design or later misattribution. The distinction between fiction and history in them is often blurred.

==14th and 15th centuries==
(Unless otherwise noted, dates given here refer to the year when the work was first ''written''.)

Along with the writings of John Ball, the earliest contributions to the Piers Plowman tradition are extensively associated with the [[Lollardy|Lollards]]:
*''[[Pierce the Ploughman's Crede]]'', an anonymous, Lollard, alliterative, anticlerical, satirical poem written c. 1395 and printed in 1553 and 1561.
*''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', also known as ''The Complaynte of the Ploughman'', a Lollard poem written ''c.'' 1400 and printed by itself about 1533-1536 and again about 1548.
*''[[The Praier and Complaynte of the Ploweman unto Christe]]'', a Lollard prose tract and prayer for reform written about 1400, with some sources putting it as early as 1350 or as late as 1450, was printed twice, in about 1531 and 1532.
*''[[Richard the Redeless]]'' and ''[[Mum and the Sothsegger]]'', both written about 1405, are usually thought to be by the same author and perhaps two parts of a single work. [[Walter William Skeat|W. W. Skeat]] attributed them to Langland himself.
*''The Crowned King'' (1415)

Less directly and self-consciously evocative of ''Piers Plowman'' are:
*''[[Jack Upland]]'', a Lollard satire written about 1389-1396
*''Responsiones ad Questiones LXV'' and ''[[Friar Daw's Reply]]'', two anti-Lollard retorts to ''Jack Upland''
*''Upland's Rejoinder'', a Lollard retort to ''Friar Daw's Reply''
*''I-blessyd Be Cristes Sonde'', sometimes wrongly referred to as ''God Speed the Plough

==16th and 17th centuries==
(Unless otherwise noted, dates given here refer to the year when the work was first ''printed''.)

Many of the previously mentioned plowman texts, which first circulated in manuscript, reappeared later in print, often with some degree of intentional alteration and editorializing that aimed at construing them as [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestant]] . This is true also of the first printed editions of ''Piers Plowman'' in 1550 and 1561 by [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]] and Owen Rogers. [[William Tyndale]] may have (and was thought by some contemporaries) to have supplied the preface to the printed edition of the ''Praier and Complaynte'', which aroused the critical pen of [[Thomas More]]. [[John Foxe]] did his part to canonize the same text in four editions of his famous ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Actes and Monuments]]'' from 1570 to 1610. Like ''Jack Upland'', ''The Plowman's Tale'' became associated with [[Chaucer#Historical Reception and Representation|Geoffrey Chaucer]] and was added by various editors to four editions of Chaucer's collected works between 1542 and 1602. ''I Playne Piers which Cannot Flatter'', a mixture of parts of ''The Plowman's Tale'' and new material added some time after 1540, was printed in 1550 and ascribed to the author of ''Piers Plowman'' who was then unknown or identified as either Chaucer, [[John Wycliffe]], or Robert Langland. ''I Playne Piers'' was reprinted by the [[Puritan]] Martinist writers in the [[Martin Marprelate]] Controversy in 1589. It was then retitled, ''O read me, for I am of great antiquitie&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. I am the Gransier of Martin Mare-prelitte''.

There were also many new texts produced in the sixteenth century that may be considered parts of the Piers Plowman tradition, such as [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Shepheardes Calendar]]'' which makes use of a character named "Piers" and consciously borrows lines from ''The Plowman's Tale''. Spenser's character, Colin Clout, who appears in two of his poems, is also a Piers-like figure derived from [[John Skelton]]. [[John Bale]] regarded Skelton as a ''vates pierius'' - poetic prophet, with ''pierius'' perhaps alluding to Piers, the pre-eminent English prophet-poet. Bale was pleased with Skelton's attacks on the clergy and his open breach of clerical celibacy. ''Colin Clout'' (1521) is one of Skelton's anti-Wolsey satires where the title character, a vagabond, complains about corrupt churchmen.

Sixteenth-century texts that refer to the poem ''Piers Plowman'' or the character "Piers Plowman" include:
*''The Banckett of Iohan the Reve unto Peirs Ploughman, Laurens laborer, Thomlyn tailer and Hobb of the hille with others'' (British Library MS Harley 207) was written c. 1532. In it, Jacke Jolie, a Protestant, quotes reformers, including [[Martin Luther]], on the [[Eucharist]]. A Catholic Piers defends the Roman doctrine.
*[[Jack of the North]], an anti-[[enclosure]] dialogue written c. 1549.
*''A Godly Dyalogue and Dysputacyion Betwene Pyers Plowman and a Popysh Preest concernyng the supper of the lorde '' (c. 1550)
*[[Thomas Churchyard]]’s ''The Contention...upon David Dycers Dreame'' (c. 1551-52)
*Possibly by [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]], ''Pyers Plowmans Exhortation unto the Lordes, Knightes, and Burgoysses of the Parlyamenthouse'' (c. 1550)
*[[George Gascoigne]], ''The Fruites of Warre'' (1575) and ''The Steel Glas'' (1576), uses but complicates the tradition. Piers becomes an ambivalent figure capable of self-interest and vice; he is no longer a pure, idealized character. Gascoigne satirizes corrupt clergy and elites as well as the "innocent" plowman types whose complaints are motivated by the same self-interest. Rampant individualism transcends all social divisions.
*Possibly by [[Francis Thynne]], ''Newes from the North Otherwise called the Conference between Simon Certain and Pierce Plowman'' (1579)
*Possibly by [[William Kempe]] and [[Edward Alleyn]], ''A Merry Knack to Know a Knave'' (1594), a late Elizabethan morality play in which Piers Plowman is introduced by Honesty and complains to the king about unjust landlords. When it was performed on 11 June 1592, a riot broke out in the audience; this led to the City Council's order that all theatres be closed until September. Another play, ''A knack to know an honest man'' (1596) is probably a response; it involves shepherds and was printed by John Danter, Thomas Nashe's printer.

Less directly associated with Piers are:
*''[[God Spede the Plough]]''
*''A Lytell Geste how the Plowman lerned his Pater Noster'' (c. 1510), printed by [[Wynkyn de Worde]] and in circulation as late as 1560 and 1582. In it a Catholic priest is the figure of right religion while the plowman is an avaricious ignoramus. Perhaps broad sympathy for this point of view explains why ''Piers Plowman'' was not printed until 1550.
*''Of Gentylnes and Nobylyte: A dyaloge betwene the marchaunt the knyght and the plowman dysputyng who is a verey gentylman and who is a noble man and how men shuld come to auctoryte, compiled in a maner of an enterlude, or the Dialogue of the Gentleman and Plowman...'' (1525). This is a dramatic work that is often mistitled as the ''Dialogue of the Gentleman and Plowman''. Its printer, [[John Rastell]], or [[John Heywood]] may have been the author. In the dialogue, the plowman takes over and wins the debate, arguing for individual merit based on inner virtue. In the process, the plowman critically examines the bases of the wealth of the landed aristocracy.
*''[[A Proper Dialogue Between A Gentleman and a Husbandman]]'' (1529 and 1530), mixes fourteenth and fifteenth-century Lollard texts with contemporary Protestant material.
*''[[The Pilgrim's Tale]]'' (c. 1530s)
*''[[John Bon and Mast Parson]]'' (1547 or 1548)
*[[Barnabe Googe]], ''Eglogs, Epytaphes and Sonettes'' (1563)
*''The Kalender of Shepardes'' (c. 1570), translated from the French by Robert Copland.
*''A Pedlar's Tale to Queen Elizabeth'' (1578-90?) A play in which the main character is an itinerant laborer with prophetic, satirical analysis and advice for elites regarding social ills.
*''Death and the Five Alls'', an illustrated broadside depicting the plowman as the pillar of society.
*''A Compendious or Briefe Examination of Certayne Ordinary Complaints'', first published in 1581. Reprinted in 1583 as ''De Republica Anglorum: A Discourse on the Commonwealth of England''. Attributed to [[Thomas Smith (diplomat)|Sir Thomas Smith]] as well as [[William Stafford (conspirator)|William Stafford]] and [[John Hales (d.1571)|John Hales]]. It discusses history and economic conditions under Edward VI. Depicts a complaining farmer/husbandman in a dialogue with a doctor who tells him to rethink his old-fashioned ideas about the agricultural economy. Outlines English social hierarchy: 1) gentlemen, 2) citizens and burgesses, 3) yeomen, 4) the fourth sort of people who do not rule. Affirms orthodox opinion that it is not for the commons to discuss or influence public matters and policy; they are politically disenfranchied within a paternalistic system which is nevertheless undercut by acknowledgment of their power even as it is denied. The common yeoman is identified as distinct from the rogue; it is the yeoman who forms the basis of English society and economy. Yet he is not to be compared to gentlemen on the basis of wit, conduct or power. The Yeomen are numerous, obedient, strong, able to endure hardship, and courageous. (I.e., they make excellent, loyal, patriotic conscripts.)
*''An Almanac for 1582'' predicts the commons will be "factious...quarrelous, impatient, and outragious, one envying the estate and degree of another: as the poor the rich, the ploughman the gentleman."
*[[John Harvey (astrologer)|John Harvey]], ''A Discorsive Problem concerning the Prophecies, How far they are to be valued, or credited, according to the surest rules, and directions in Divinitie, Philosophie, Astrologie and other learning'' (1588) states, "For how easily might I heer repeate almost infinite examples of villainous attempts, pernitious uprores, horrible mischeefes, slaughters, blasphemies, heresies, and all other indignities, and outrages, desperately committed, and perpetrated through means of such inveterate, and new broched forgeries.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. neither shal I therefore neede to ransacke Pierce Plowmans satchell; nor to descant upon fortunes, newly collected out of the old Shepherds Kalendar..."
*[[Richard Harvey]], ''Plaine Percevall the Peace-Maker of England'' (1590), an unsophisticated man of common-sense, Percevall attacks all the anti-Martinists but purports to settle the controversy.
*[[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', books 1-3 (1590) In the first book, the Redcross knight's origins are rich with multiple meanings: as a national symbol, he is St. George, England's patron saint, and Spenser stresses the humble, agricultural origins of the name George (Georgos is Greek for "farmer"). On a more individualized level, Redcrosse represents a radical social mobility, going from the plow to the queen's court. Spenser is no doubt expressing a kind of personal allegory that would resonate with other ambitious men with humble origins, but such mobility also threatens the agrarian order by eroding the fixity of the social hierarchy upheld by the earlier, conservative agrarian complaints:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thence she thee brought into this faerie Lond,
 And in an heaped furrow did thee hyde,
 Where thee a Ploughman all unweeting fond,
 As he his toylsome teme that way did guyde,
 And brought thee up in ploughmans state to byde,
 Whereof Georgos he thee gave to name;
 Till prickt with courage, and thy forces pryde,
 To Faery court thou cam'st to seeke for fame,
 And prove thy puissant armes, as seemes thee best became.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*[[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]], ''A Quip for an Upstart Courtier'' (1592), the basis for a lost play performed by The Chamberlain's Men, ''Clothbreeches and Velvethose'' (1600).
*[[Thomas Nashe]], ''Pierce Pennilesse His Supplication to the Devil'' (1592)
*[[Gabriel Harvey]], ''Pierce's Supererogation'' (1593), a response to Nashe's attacks on Harvey and his brothers.
*[[Robert Wilson (dramatist)|Robert Wilson]] ''The Cobler's Prophecy'' (1594), a play.
*''Pedler's Prophecie'' (1595), a play.
*[[Henry Chettle]], ''Piers Plainnes seaven yeres Prentiship'' In Arcadia, a picaro Piers talks about his life (much of it spent in London) to Arcadian shepherds in Tempe. He has served as an apprentice under seven bad masters (an occasion for another taxonomy of London life and vices). Giving up on the court as an exception to general corruption, Chettle's Piers follows the precedent from Virgil to Wyatt and Spenser: satisfaction will only be found in pastoral retirement. Like much other late Elizabethan prose, [[John Lyly]]'s ''[[Euphues (1578)|Euphues]]'' is an obvious source of inspiration. The influence of other masterpieces of rogue literature is apparent, especially [[Nashe]]'s ''Pierce Pennilesse'' and ''[[The Unfortunate Traveller]]''.

Like Thomas More and Robert Crowley, Bishop [[Hugh Latimer]] valued "commune wealth" more than "private commodity." He was an outspoken critic of enclosure, the abuses of landlords, and the aristocrats who lined their pockets through the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. Like Crowley, Latimer was able to be especially outspoken when [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] had controlling influence in the court as [[Lord Protector]] of England during part of the minority of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. A famous sermon of Latimer's that represented preachers as God's plowmen, "The Sermon of the Plowers," was delivered at [[St. Paul's Cross]], 18 January 1548 and was printed that year by [[John Day (printer)|John Day]]. This was the last of four "Sermons on the Plough;" unfortunately the first three are lost. While Latimer's message is spiritual, it has a sharp political edge that also acknowledges the material concerns of people affected by enclosure. Latimer attacks idle clergy as "plowmen" who cause a spiritual famine, and enclosure is used as a metaphor for hindrances to proper preaching. The devil is called the busiest bishop and greatest plowman in England; he is seeding the land with the ritual and ornamental trappings of popery. Latimer himself, through the style of his sermons, typifies the plain, homely and direct speech of Piers and popular Protestantism. [[Anthony Anderson]]'s ''The Shield of our Safetie'' (1581) uses Latimer's figure of the pastor as a plowman but is unwilling to ascribe special virtue to the commons and rural laborers. Godliness is lacking "from top to toe" in England, "from the Nobilitie, to the Plowman and his mate." [[George Gifford (Puritan)|George Gifford]]'s ''A Briefe Discourse of Certaine Points of the Religion which is among the Common Sort of Christians'' (1583) asserts that "it is not for plowmen to meddle with scriptures."

==Trends and influences==
The [[early modern]] dissemination and reception of ''Visio Willelmi de Petro Ploughman'' ("William's Vision of Piers Plowman") from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century reveals a great deal about changes in English society and politics. Clearly orthodox [[Roman Catholic]] in doctrine but reformist in that it posed social criticism and advocated moral, economic, and political change, the original poem(s)--and the figure of Piers in the popular imagination--were often viewed quite differently.

''Piers'' was open to being appropriated by Lollards and later Protestant reformers. [[William Tyndale]]'s memorable statement to a "popish priest," recorded in [[John Foxe]]' ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Acts and Monuments]]'', is an echo of Erasmus' ''Paraclesis'', which also resonated with popular images of the pious plowman: "If God spare my life ere many years, I will cause a boy that driveth the plow shall know more of the scripture than thou dost." After nearly two centuries, the plowman tradition of social complaint and satire became more worldly-wise and less ardently idealistic. It became, increasingly, a secular vehicle for complaining about class rivalries and political dissent--and also for containing or restraining such things. What is notable about the Piers/plowman literature of the Elizabethan era is the general absence of the old religious radical who speaks the plain truth for the poor, godly commons against corrupt elites and hypocritical English clergy. In many cases the name of Piers remained, but his vocation was altered; with few exceptions, he was no longer specifically a religious reformer. Criticism of the wealthy and powerful continued, but rather than directly addressing complaints to them and to the mnonarch and parliament as Edwardians like Crowley, Latimer and [[Thomas Lever]] had done, they became the subject of comic, often satiric, popular entertainment. Plays and pamphlets became the vehicle of social analysis, concerned with class identities and rivalries that were rendered with greater complexity and detail than in found in the earlier literature.

After the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], the Piers tradition changed, particularly after censorship laws put into effect in 1551, 1553, and 1559, officially banned discussion of religious matters or matters of state. Other causes were also at work. With the division and collapse of [[Christendom]] in the Reformation, the medieval conception of the social hierarchy, as well as [[Purgatory]] and [[Hell]], so central to Langland's poem, were vestigial remnants of a passing order. In the Elizabethan era, Piers' Christological aspect became fully detached from his role as the universal commoner, a secular economic man among economic men with clashing interests. At the same time, there was a bifurcation of the original [[carnivalesque]] world of Langland's Piers that had common, aristocratic, and divine characters. The moral and apocalyptic aspects of ''Piers'' flourished briefly at mid-century but then dissipated along with the idealism of the Edwardian reformers and their vision of a united commonwealth of interdependent estates. Popular literature evoking Piers by name or in spirit began to construe elites as people with whom one may compete and win. Langland's "fair field of folk" became a socioeconomic playing field on which elites are perhaps no less important to the nation than the common people. In this way Langland's Piers and Piers-like figures helped establish an English national identity based on and for the popular rather than the elite culture. This popular self-understanding seems to have flourished especially in the [[nonconformist]] [[Puritan]] mind where it could be radicalized. In other cases, it could be a basis for [[Statism|statist]] [[nationalism]]

According to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]], military conscription, which was at a high in the late sixteenth century, gave "great ease and good to the country to be ridd of those kinde of people whoe otherwyse wil be a burthen to the country." Such attempts to channel and appropriate the power of the commoners did not escape their notice. In ''Pierce Pennilesse'', Thomas Nashe wrote, "If they have no service abroad, they will make mutinies at home..." Popular awareness of such strategies to channel the power of the commons toward royal interests did not generate resistance, but offered a chance for the commons to insert their own interests into the transaction. Perhaps this is why in the Elizabethan era, Piers and Piers-like figures began to appear as itinerant laborers and tradesmen: tinkers, coblers and shoemakers who claimed to represent true Englishness over against effete, pretentious elites. While affirming their loyalty, these humble figures labored to define an English identity from below that was drawn from native, popular traditions going back to Langland and Chaucer. To the extent that the popular opposition between plain and ornate, honest and dissembling was associated with courtiers, (South European) foreignness and Catholicism, the plowman tradition continued to be anti-Catholic and staunchly Protestant. 

This popular image of the English commonwealth is often defined in the Elizabethan era in opposition to Catholic nations and "Rome," which are represented as less free and unvirtuous. Hutchins notes that "Even in the most unremittingly absolutist interpretations of Tudor theories of rule, the qualities that Elizabethans claim make a good ruler include dignified concern for the common people" (229). Popular plowman literature constantly reasserts this view: English society is based on its regard for its foundation in the commons. As a sturdy working-class fellow in the popular culture, it is not surprising that Piers never made it into the works of the elite writers who predominate in the English literary canon. Moreover, Piers was even more archaic and parochial than Chaucer, with the added notoriety of political subversiveness and (now illegal) prophecy. University educated, aspiring courtier-writers with poorer, often rural, backgrounds (e.g., Spenser and Harvey) may have been uneasy with a tradition that sometimes cast a cold eye on the lives and ambitions of upwardly mobile urbanites like themselves. In Nashe we find a new Piers, Pierce Pennilesse, who represents the young London malcontent writer who desires but lacks patronage and recognition of his talent. While this literature is far removed from the straightforward religious and political criticisms of Crowley and others, writers like Nashe and Greene were still finding ways to use the old moral-satirical tradition to expose and attack--or just laugh at--vices directly related to contemporary social and political conditions.

'''Pinball''' is a type of [[arcade game]], in which points are scored by a player manipulating one or more steel balls on a play field inside a glass-covered cabinet called a '''pinball table''' (or "pinball machine"). The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Many modern pinball machines include a story line where the player must complete certain objectives in a certain fashion to complete the story, usually earning high scores for different methods of completing the game. Points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the play field. A drain is situated at the bottom of the play field, partially protected by player-controlled plastic bats called [[#Flippers|flippers]]. A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain a certain number of times. Secondary objectives are to maximize the time spent playing (by earning "extra balls" and keeping the ball in play as long as possible) and to earn bonus games (known as "replays").

==History==

===Pre-modern: Development of outdoor and tabletop ball games===

The origin of pinball are intertwined with the history of many other games. Games played outdoors by rolling balls or stones on a grass course, such as [[bocce]] or [[bowls]], eventually evolved into various local [[ground billiards]] games played by hitting the balls with sticks and propelling them at targets, often around obstacles. [[Croquet]], golf and [[paille-maille]] eventually derived from ground billiards variants.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The evolution of outdoor games finally led to indoor versions that could be played on a table, such as [[Cue sports|billiards]], or on the floor of a pub, like [[bowling]] and [[shuffleboard]]. The tabletop versions of these games became the ancestors of modern pinball.

===Late 1700s: Spring launcher invented===
[[File:Early Pinball.jpg|thumb|''{{lang|fr|Billard japonais}}'', Southern Germany/Alsace ca. 1750–70. It already has a spring mechanism to propel the ball, 100 years prior to Montague Redgrave's patent.]]
In France, during the long 1643–1715 reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], billiard tables were narrowed, with wooden pins or skittles at one end of the table, and players would shoot balls with a stick or cue from the other end, in a game inspired as much by [[bowling]] as billiards. Pins took too long to reset when knocked down, so they were eventually fixed to the table, and holes in the bed of the table became the targets. Players could ricochet balls off the pins to achieve the harder scorable holes. A standardized version of the game eventually became known as [[bagatelle]].

Somewhere between the 1750s and 1770s, the bagatelle variant ''{{lang|fr|Billard japonais}}'', or Japanese billiards in English, was invented in Western Europe, despite its name. It used thin metal pins and replaced the cue at the player's end of the table with a coiled spring and a plunger. The player shot balls up the inclined playfield toward the scoring targets using this plunger, a device that remains in use in pinball to this day, and the game was also directly ancestral to [[pachinko]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===1869: Spring launchers become mainstream===

In 1869, British inventor [[Montague Redgrave]] settled in the United States and manufactured bagatelle tables in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. In 1871 Redgrave was granted U.S. Patent #115,357 for his "Improvements in Bagatelle",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdb.org/showpic.pl?id=4542&amp;depth=0&amp;picno=6000 |title=Internet Pinball Machine Database: M. Redgrave Bagatelle Company '1871 Redgrave Parlor Bagatelle' Images |publisher=Ipdb.org |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; another name for the spring launcher that was first introduced in ''{{lang|fr|Billard japonais}}''. The game also shrank in size to fit atop a bar or counter. The balls became marbles and the wickets became small metal pins. Redgrave's popularization of the spring launcher and innovations in game design are acknowledged as the birth of pinball in its modern form.

===1931: Coin operation introduced===
[[File:Flipper1948.jpg|thumb|250px|An early pinball game without flippers, circa 1932]]

By the 1930s, manufacturers were producing coin-operated versions of bagatelles, now known as "marble games" or "pin games". The table was under glass and used M. Redgrave's plunger device to propel the ball into the upper playfield.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 1931 David Gottlieb's ''[[Baffle Ball]]'' became the first hit of the coin-operated era. Selling for $17.50, the game dispensed five to seven balls for a penny.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The game resonated with people wanting cheap entertainment in the [[Great Depression]]-era economy. Most [[drugstore]]s and [[tavern]]s in the U.S. operated pinball machines,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} with many locations quickly recovering the cost of the game. Baffle Ball sold over 50,000 units{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and established [[Gottlieb]] as the first major manufacturer of pinball machines.

In 1932, Gottlieb distributor [[Raymond Moloney]] found it hard to obtain more Baffle Ball units to sell. In his frustration he founded Lion Manufacturing to produce a game of his own design, ''Ballyhoo'', named after a popular magazine of the day. The game became a smash hit. Its larger playfield and ten pockets made it more challenging than ''Baffle Ball'', selling 50,000 units in 7 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholzroland.de/VPStuff/BALLYHOO.htm |title=Ballyhoo |publisher=Scholzroland.de |date=April 2, 1932 |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moloney eventually changed the name of his company to [[Bally Manufacturing|Bally]] to reflect the success of this game. These early machines were relatively small, mechanically simple and designed to sit on a counter or bar top.

===1933: Electrification and active bumpers introduced===

The 1930s saw major advances in pinball design with the introduction of electrification. A company called Pacific Amusements in Los Angeles, California produced a game called ''Contact'' in 1933. ''Contact'' had an electrically powered [[solenoid]] to propel the ball out of a bonus hole in the middle of the playfield. Another solenoid rang a bell to reward the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|2073132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designer of ''Contact'', Harry Williams, would eventually form his own company, [[WMS Industries|Williams Manufacturing]], in 1944. Other manufacturers quickly followed suit with similar features. Electric lights soon became a standard feature of all subsequent pinball games, designed to attract players.

By the end of 1932, there were approximately 150 companies manufacturing pinball machines, most of them in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago has been the center of pinball manufacturing ever since. Competition among the companies was strong, and by 1934 there were 14 companies remaining.

During WWII, all of the major manufacturers of coin-operated games turned to the manufacture of equipment for the war effort. Some companies, like Williams, bought old games from operators and refurbished them, adding new artwork with a patriotic theme. At the end of the war, a generation of Americans looked for amusement in bars and malt shops, and pinball saw another golden age. Improvements such as the tilt mechanism and free games (known as replays) appeared.

===1947: Flippers introduced===

Gottlieb's ''[[Humpty Dumpty (pinball)|Humpty Dumpty]]'', introduced in 1947, was the first game to add player-controlled flippers to keep the ball in play longer, adding a skill factor to the game.&lt;ref&gt;'Balls-A-Poppin'(1956) was the first flipper machine to feature multi-ball play. An earlier flipperless electromechanical pinball machine that also featured multi-ball play was Dudley-Clark Co.'s 1934 'Live Power'.&lt;/ref&gt; The low power flippers required three pairs around the playfield to get the ball to the top.

''Triple Action'' was the first game to feature just two flippers at the bottom of the playfield. Unlike in modern machines, the flippers faced outwards. These flippers were made more powerful by the addition of a [[direct current|DC]] (direct current) power supply. These innovations were some of many by designer [[Steve Kordek]].

The first game to feature the familiar dual-inward-facing-flipper design was Gottlieb's ''Just 21'' released in January 1950, though the flippers were rather far apart to allow for a turret ball shooter at the bottom center of the playfield. ''Spot Bowler'', also made by Gottlieb and released in October 1950. was the first game with inward-facing flippers placed close together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmigaming.com/pinballhistory.htm |title=The History of Pinball Machines |publisher=Bmigaming.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-war era was dominated by [[Gottlieb]]. Game designers Wayne Neyens and [[Ed Krynski]], along with artist Leroy Parker, produced games that collectors consider some of the best classic pinball machines.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===1970s: Solid-state electronics and digital displays introduced===

[[File:Visible Pinball III - Pacific Pinball Museum cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A clear walled electromechanical pinball machine created by the [[Pacific Pinball Museum]] to show what the insides of pinball machines look like]]

The introduction of [[microprocessor]]s brought pinball into the realm of [[electronic game|electronic gaming]]. The electromechanical [[relay]]s and scoring reels that drove games in the 1950s and 1960s were replaced in the 1970s with [[circuit board]]s and digital displays.  The first solid-state pinball is believed to be [[Mirco Games]]' ''[[The Spirit of '76 (pinball)|The Spirit of '76]]'' (1976),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/toys/4276614|title=Top 8 Most Innovative Pinball Machines of All Time|work=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the first mainstream solid-state game was Williams' ''Hot Tip'' (1977).  This new technology led to a boom for Williams and Bally, who attracted more players with games featuring more complex rules, digital sound effects, and speech.

The [[Golden age of arcade video games|video game boom]] of the 1980s signaled the end of the boom for pinball. Arcades replaced rows of pinball machines with video games like 1978's ''[[Space Invaders]]'', 1979's ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'', 1980's ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and 1981's ''[[Galaga]]''. These earned significantly greater profits than the pinball machines of the day, while simultaneously requiring less maintenance. Bally, Williams, and Gottlieb continued to make pinball machines, while they also manufactured video games in much higher numbers. Many of the larger companies were acquired by, or merged with, other companies. [[Chicago Coin]] was purchased by the Stern family, who brought the company into the digital era as Stern Enterprises, which closed its doors in the mid-1980s. Bally exited the pinball business in 1988 and sold their assets to Williams, who subsequently used the Bally trademark from then on for about half of their pinball releases.

While the video game craze of the late 1970s and early 1980s dealt a severe blow to pinball revenue, it did spark the creative talents within the industry. All companies involved tried to take advantage of the new solid state technology to improve player appeal of pinball and win back former players from video games. Some of this creativity resulted in landmark designs and features still present today. Some of these include speech, such as Williams' ''[[Gorgar]]''; ramps for the ball to travel around, such as Williams' ''[[Space Shuttle (pinball)|Space Shuttle]]''; "multiball", used on Williams' ''[[Firepower (pinball)|Firepower]]''; multi-level games like Gottlieb's ''[[Black Hole (pinball)|Black Hole]]'' and Williams' ''[[Black Knight (pinball)|Black Knight]]''; and blinking chase lights, as used on Bally's ''[[Xenon (pinball)|Xenon]]''. Although these novel features did not win back players as the manufacturers had hoped, they changed players' perception of pinball for coming decades.

===1980s and 1990s: Pinball in the digital age===
[[File:20080405-Vegas004-PinballHOF02.jpg|thumb|right|400px|A row of pinball machines at the [[Pinball Hall of Fame]] in Las Vegas, Nevada.]]
After the collapse of the coin-operated video game industry, pinball saw another comeback in the 1990s. Some new manufacturers entered the field such as Capcom Pinball and Alvin G. and Company, founded by Alvin Gottlieb, son of David Gottlieb. Gary Stern, the son of Williams co-founder Sam Stern, founded [[Data East]] Pinball with funding from Data East Japan.

The games from Williams now dominated the industry, with complicated mechanical devices and more elaborate display and sound systems attracting new players to the game. Licensing popular movies and icons of the day became a staple for pinball, with Bally/Williams' ''[[The Addams Family (pinball)|The Addams Family]]'' hitting an all-time modern sales record of 20,270 machines. Two years later, Williams commemorated this benchmark with a limited edition of 1,000 ''Addams Family Gold'' pinball machines, featuring gold-colored trim and updated software with new game features. Other notable popular licenses included ''[[Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation (pinball)|Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Expanding markets in Europe and Asia helped fuel the revival of interest. [[Pat Lawlor]] was a designer, working for Williams until their exit from the industry in 1999. About a year later, Lawlor returned to the industry, starting his own company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patlawlordesign.com/ |title=Pat Lawlor Design |publisher=Pat Lawlor Design |date=December 29, 2009 |accessdate=October 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111142800/http://www.patlawlordesign.com/ |archivedate=November 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; working in conjunction with Stern Pinball to produce new games.

The end of the 1990s saw another downturn in the industry, with Gottlieb, Capcom, and Alvin G. closing by the end of 1996. Data East's pinball division was acquired by [[Sega]] and became [[Sega Pinball]] in 1994. By 1997, there were two companies left: Sega Pinball and Williams. In 1999, Sega sold their pinball division to Gary Stern (President of Sega Pinball at the time) who called his company [[Stern (game company)|Stern Pinball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sternpinball.com |title=Stern Pinball |publisher=Stern Pinball |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Williams games rarely sold more than 4,000 units. In 1999, Williams attempted to revive sales with the [[Pinball 2000]] line of games, merging a video display into the pinball playfield. The reception was initially good with ''[[Revenge From Mars]]'' selling well over 6,000 machines, but short of the 10,000-plus production runs for releases just six years earlier. The next Pinball 2000 game, ''[[Star Wars Episode I (pinball)|Star Wars Episode I]]'', sold only a little over 3,500 machines. Williams exited the pinball business to focus on making gaming equipment for casinos, which was more profitable. They licensed the rights to reproduce Bally/Williams parts to Illinois Pinball and the rights to reproduce full-sized machines to The Pinball Factory. Stern Pinball remained the only manufacturer of original pinball machines until 2013, when [[Jersey Jack Pinball]] started shipping ''[[The Wizard of Oz (pinball)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Most members of the design teams for Stern Pinball are former employees of Williams.

===2000s and Beyond: Revival===
After the closure of most of the pinball manufacturers in the 1990s, smaller independent manufacturers started appearing in the early 2000s.

In November 2005 The Pinball Factory (TPF) in [[Melbourne]], Australia, announced that they would be producing a new ''[[The Crocodile Hunter|Crocodile Hunter]]''-themed pinball machine under the Bally label. With the death of [[Steve Irwin]], it was announced that the future of this game was uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinballnews.com/news/irwin.html |title=Pinball News article with Steve Irwin update |publisher=Pinballnews.com |date=September 19, 2006 |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 TPF announced that they would be reproducing two popular 90's era Williams machines, ''[[Medieval Madness]]'' and ''Cactus Canyon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinballnews.com/news/reruns2.html |title=Pinball News article on The Pinball Factory's rereleases |publisher=Pinballnews.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; TPF however was unable to make good on its promises to produce new machines, and in October 2010 transferred its Williams Electronics Games licenses as well as its pinball spare parts manufacturing and distribution business to Planetary Pinball Supply Inc, a California distributor of pinball replacement parts.[http://www.planetarypinball.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Store_Code=PP&amp;Screen=PRESS]

In 2006, Illinois pinball company PinBall Manufacturing Inc. produced 178 reproductions of Capcom's ''Big Bang Bar'' for the European and US markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinballnews.com/news/bigbang.html |title=Pinball News article on Big Bang Bar |publisher=Pinballnews.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinballnews.com/news/bbb2.html |title=Pinball News article on Big Bang Bar update |publisher=Pinballnews.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, MarsaPlay in Spain manufactured a remake of [[Inder (company)|Inder's]] original ''Canasta'' titled ''New Canasta'',&lt;ref name="ipdb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=5554|title=Internet Pinball Machine Database: MarsaPlay 'New Canasta'|website=www.ipdb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vendingtimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vendingtimes.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?nm=Vending+Features&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications::Article&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=560086B3E849473C9394876637FA79FF|title=Spain's Marsaplay Introduces Pinball Machine That Unites Classic And Modern Features - Articles - Vending Times|website=www.vendingtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the first game to include a [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD) screen in the backbox.

In 2013, the [[Chicago Gaming|Chicago Gaming Company]] announced the creation of a remake of [[Medieval Madness]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinballnews.com/games/medievalmadness/index.html|title=Pinball News - First and Free|website=www.pinballnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vendingtimes.com/main/articles.aspx?iid=9A1679B86AD74858B79A08F544F812C0|title=Chicago Gaming's Medieval Madness Debut Ushers In Modern Pinball Era's Latest Sensation  - Articles - Vending Times|website=vendingtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2016/02/10/medieval-madness-remake-in-depth-review/|title=MEDIEVAL MADNESS REMAKE: IN-DEPTH REVIEW|date=February 10, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This was later followed by a 2017 release of a remake of ''[[Attack From Mars]]''.

In 2014, the new pinball manufacturer [[Charlie Emery|Spooky Pinball]] released their first game ''America's Most Haunted''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=6161|title=Internet Pinball Machine Database: Spooky Pinball LLC 'America's Most Haunted'|website=www.ipdb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the new British pinball manufacturer [[Heighway Pinball]] released the racing themed pinball machine ''Full Throttle''. The game has its LCD screen for scores, info and animations located in the playfield surface at player’s eye view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinballnews.com/games/fullthrottle/index9.html|title=Pinball News - First and Free|website=www.pinballnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was designed with modularity in mind so that the playfield and artwork could be swapped out for future game titles.

In 2016, [http://www.dutchpinball.com Dutch Pinball], based in the Netherlands, released their first game ''The Big Lebowski'', based on the 1998 film, ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=6320|title=Internet Pinball Machine Database: Dutch Pinball 'The Big Lebowski Pinball'|website=www.ipdb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [http://www.multimorphic.com/ Multimorphic] began shipping their pinball machine platform after several years of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=6449|title=Internet Pinball Machine Database: Multimorphic, Inc. 'Lexy Lightspeed Escape From Earth'|website=www.ipdb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modular design where different games can be swapped into the cabinet. It also has a large interactive display as the playfield surface, which is different from all prior pinball machines that were traditionally made of plywood and embedded with translucent plastic inserts for lighting.

==Pinball and gambling==

Pinball machines, like many other mechanical games, were sometimes used as gambling devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvin3m.com/wmswood/index.htm |title=Marvin Guide to Williams Woodrail Pinballs 1940s/1950s |publisher=Marvin3m.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pinball machines, such as Bally's "bingos", featured a grid on the backglass scoring area with spaces corresponding to targets or holes on the playfield. Free games could be won if the player was able to get the balls to land in a winning pattern; however, doing this was nearly [[random]], and a common use for such machines was for gambling. Other machines allowed a player to win and accumulate large numbers of "free games" which could then be cashed out for money with the location owner. Later, this type of feature was discontinued in an effort to legitimize the machines, and to avoid legal problems in areas where awarding free games was considered illegal, some games, called Add-A-Ball, did away with the free game feature, instead giving players extra balls to play (between 5 and 25 in most cases). These extra balls were indicated via lighted graphics in the backglass or by a ball count wheel, but in some areas that was disallowed, and some games were shipped with a sticker to cover the counters.

Pinball was banned beginning in the early 1940s until 1976 in New York City.&lt;ref name="PopularMecg1"&gt;{{cite web | title=11 Things You Didn't Know About Pinball History | work=Toys | publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]] | url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/toys/4328211-new#fbIndex1 | accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York mayor [[Fiorello La Guardia]] was responsible for the ban, believing that it robbed school children of their hard earned nickels and dimes.&lt;ref name="PopularMecg1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PopularMecg2"&gt;{{cite web | title=NYPD Held Prohibition-Style Raids on Pinball | work=11 Things You Didn't Know About Pinball History | publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]] | url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/toys/4328211-new#fbIndex2 | accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; La Guardia spearheaded major raids throughout the city, collecting thousands of machines. The mayor participated with police in destroying machines with [[sledgehammer]]s before dumping the remnants into the city's rivers.&lt;ref name="PopularMecg2"/&gt;

The ban ended when Roger Sharpe (a star witness for the AMOA – Amusement and Music Operators Association) testified in April 1976 before a committee in a [[Manhattan]] courtroom that pinball games had become games of skill and were not games of chance, that is, gambling. He began to play one of two games set up in the courtroom, and – in a move he compares to [[Babe Ruth]]'s home run in the [[1932 World Series]] – called out precisely what he was going to shoot for, and then proceeded to do so. Astonished committee members reportedly voted to remove the ban, which was followed in other cities. (Sharpe reportedly acknowledges, in a self-deprecating manner, his courtroom shot was by sheer luck although there was admittedly skill involved in what he did.)&lt;ref name="ChicagoReader"&gt;{{cite news |title=End Game |author=Seth Porges |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/pdf/050902/050902_section_1.pdf |newspaper=[[Chicago Reader]] |date=September 2, 2005 |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like New York, Los Angeles banned pinball machines in 1939. The ban was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of California]] in 1974 because (1) if pinball machines were games of chance, the ordinance was preempted by state law governing games of chance in general, and (2) if they were games of skill, the ordinance was unconstitutional as a denial of the [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection of the laws]].&lt;ref&gt;''Cossack v. City of Los Angeles'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C3/11C3d726.htm 11 Cal. 3d 726] (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was rarely enforced, Chicago's ban on pinball lasted three decades and ended in 1976.  Philadelphia and Salt Lake City also had similar bans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/end-game/Content?oid=919800|title=End Game|work=Chicago Reader|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5899281/did-you-know-pinball-was-once-declared-illegal|title=Pinball Was Once Illegal|author=Luke Plunkett|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Kotaku|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of these events, some towns in America still have such bans on their books; the town of [[Kokomo, Indiana]] lifted its ordinance banning pinball in December 2016.&lt;ref name="ars-kokomoban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Game over for law outlawing pinball in Indiana town|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/12/game-over-for-law-outlawing-pinball-in-indiana-town/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pachinko===

Another close but distinct relative of pinball is [[pachinko]], a gambling game played in Japan. Although they share a common ancestry, the games are very different, in that pachinko involves shooting many small balls repeatedly into a nearly vertical playfield, while pinball is about the manipulation of the small number of balls currently in play on a near-horizontal playfield.

==Machine layout==
The key attribute of a successful pinball game is an interesting and challenging layout of scoring opportunities on the playfield. Many types of targets and features have been developed over the years.
 {{See also|Glossary of pinball terms}}

===Playfield===
[[File:High Speed Playfield.JPG|thumb|The playfield of the ''High Speed'' pinball machine]]
The ''playfield'' is a [[plane (geometry)|planar]] surface inclined upward from three to seven [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (current convention is six and a half degrees), away from the player, and includes multiple targets and scoring objectives. Some operators intentionally extend threaded levelers on the rear legs and/or shorten or remove the levelers on the front legs to create additional incline in the playfield, making the ball move faster and harder to play. It is important that the playfield be level left-to-right; a quick visual test compares the top of the back cabinet against a brick or block wall behind it, or to roll a marble down the center of the playfield glass. If it clearly rolls off to one side, a player may be inclined to stuff folded paper beneath the legs on the lower side to level the playfield. Additionally, leg levelers that are all extended fully make the game easier to nudge; when collapsed low, the entire game is more stable, and nudging becomes harder.

The ball is put into play by use of the ''plunger'', a [[Spring (device)|spring]]-loaded rod that strikes the ball as it rests in an entry lane, or as in some newer games, by a button that signals the game logic to fire a [[solenoid]] that strikes the ball. With both devices the result is the same: The ball is propelled upwards onto the playfield. Once a ball is in play, it tends to move downward towards the player, although the ball can move in any direction, sometimes unpredictably, due to contact with objects on the playfield or by the player's own actions. To return the ball to the upper part of the playfield, the player makes use of one or more ''flippers''.

Manipulation of the ball may also be accomplished by various tricks, such as "[[Pinball#Nudging|nudging]]". However, excessive nudging is generally penalized by the loss of the current player's turn (known as ''tilting'') or ending of the entire game when the nudging is particularly violent (known as ''slam tilting''). This penalty was instituted because nudging the machine too much may damage it. Many games also have a slam tilt in the bottom of the lower cabinet to end the game if the cabinet is raised and dropped to the floor in an attempt to falsely trigger the coin counting switch.

====Plunger====
The ''plunger'' is a [[Spring (device)|spring]]-loaded rod with a small handle, used to propel the ball into the playfield. The player can control the amount of [[force]] used for launching by pulling the plunger a certain distance (thus changing the spring [[compression (physical)|compression]]). This is often used for a "skill shot," in which a player attempts to launch a ball so that it exactly hits a specified target. Once the ball is in motion in the main area of the playfield, the plunger is not used again until another ball must be brought onto the playfield. In modern machines, an [[electronics|electronically controlled]] launcher is sometimes substituted for the plunger.
The shape of the ball launch button that replaces the plunger may be modified to fit the aesthetics of a particular game's theme, such as being made to look like the trigger of a gun in a game with a military or action-hero theme.

====Flippers====
[[File:Pinball Flippers - Demolition Man.JPG|thumb|left|Flippers are used by the player to redirect the ball]]
The ''flippers'' are one or more small mechanically or electromechanically controlled levers, roughly {{cvt|3|to|7|cm|frac=4}} in length, used for redirecting the ball up the playfield. They are the main control that the player has over the ball. Careful timing and positional control allows the player to intentionally direct the ball in a range of directions with various levels of velocity. With the flippers, the player attempts to move the ball to hit various types of scoring targets, and to keep the ball from disappearing off the bottom of the playfield. The very first pinball games appeared in the early 1930s and did not have flippers; after launch the ball simply proceeded down the playfield, directed by static nails (or "pins") to one of several scoring areas. (These pins gave the game its name.) In 1947, the first mechanical flippers appeared on Gottlieb's ''[[Humpty Dumpty (pinball)|Humpty Dumpty]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=1254 ''Humpty Dumpty''] data on the [http://www.ipdb.org/ Internet Pinball Database]. Retrieved d.d. October 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the early 1950s, the familiar two-flipper configuration, with the flippers at the bottom of the playfield above the center drain, had become standard. Some machines also added a third or fourth flipper midway up the playfield.

The new flipper ushered in the "golden age" of pinball, where the fierce competition between the various pinball manufacturers led to constant innovation in the field. Various types of stationary and moving targets were added, spinning scoring reels replaced games featuring static scores lit from behind. Multiplayer scores were added soon after, and then bells and other noise-makers, all of which began to make pinball less a game and more of an experience. The flippers have loaned pinball its common name in many languages, where the game is known mainly as "flipper".

====Bumpers====
&lt;!-- [[Bumper]] links to this section --&gt;
''Bumpers'' are round knobs that, when hit, will actively push the ball away. There is also an earlier variety of bumper (known as a ''dead bumper'' or ''passive bumper'') that doesn't propel the ball away; most bumpers on machines built since the 1960s are active bumpers, variously called "pop bumpers," "thumper bumpers," "jet bumpers," or "turbo bumpers." Most recent games include a set of pop bumpers, usually three, sometimes more or fewer depending on the designer's goals. Bumpers predate flippers, and active bumpers added a great deal of spice to older games.

Pop bumpers are operated by a switch connected to a ring surrounding the bottom circumference of the bumper that is suspended several millimeters above the playfield surface. When the ball rolls over this ring and forces one side of it down, a switch is closed that activates the bumper's solenoid. This pulls down a tapered ring surrounding the central post of the bumper that pushes downward and outward on the ball, propelling it away.

====Kickers and slingshots====
[[File:Pinball Slingshot - The Machine.JPG|thumb|upright|Slingshots have rubber pads which detect the ball's impact and automatically push it away at speed]]
''Kickers'' and ''slingshots'' are rubber pads which propel the ball away upon impact, like bumpers, but are usually a horizontal side of a wall. Every recent pinball machine includes slingshots to the upper left and upper right of the lowest set of flippers; older games used more experimental arrangements. They operate similarly to pop bumpers, with a switch on each side of a solenoid-operated lever arm in a typical arrangement. The switches are closed by ball contact with the rubber on the face of the kicker and this activates the solenoid.

Early pinball machines typically had full solenoid current passing through trigger switches for all types of solenoids, from kickers to pop bumpers to the flippers themselves. This caused arcing across switch contacts and rapid contact fouling and failure. As electronics were gradually implemented in pinball design, solenoids began to be switched by power transistors under software control to lower switch voltage and current, vastly extend switch service lifetime, and add flexibility to game design.

As an example, some later machines had flippers that could be operated independently of the flipper button by the machine's software. The upper-left flipper during "Thing Flips" on ''The Addams Family'' pinball machine triggers automatically a brief moment after the ball passes an optical sensor just above the flipper.

The smaller, lower-powered solenoids were first to be transistorized, followed later by the higher-current solenoids as the price, performance, and reliability of power transistors improved over the years.

====Targets====
[[File:Pinball Target - Demolition Man.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Stationary targets detect the ball's impact and typically increment the player's score]]
* ''Stationary Targets'': These are static targets that simply record when a ball strikes them. These are generally the simplest playfield elements. They are also known as ''spot targets'' or ''standup targets''.
* ''Bullseye Targets'': These are static targets that have two concentric elements, similar to a stationary target. Hitting the outer ring usually scores lower than hitting the center bull's eye. They are found mostly on older electro-mechanical games.
* ''Drop targets'': These are targets that drop below the playfield when hit. Eliminating an entire row in this manner may lead to any of various features. Once an entire bank of drop targets is hit, the bank may reset or pop back up. Alternatively, the drop targets can be placed in front of other targets, requiring the drop target to be knocked down before the targets behind can be hit, or the drop target may only pop up at specific times to deny the player the ability to shoot the ball into whatever is behind it. If used in the latter way, the target is usually blocking a lane or ramp.
* ''Kicking Target'': Used rarely, these targets look like stationary targets, but when hit they kick the ball away in the opposite direction much like a slingshot or bumper.
* ''Vari-Target'': These targets reward a different number of points depending on how hard the target was hit. It is a metal arm that pivots under the playfield. When a ball hits it, it ratchets back sometimes, resetting immediately or resetting only after it is hit all the way back. A large sum of points is usually rewarded when the target is hit back all the way with one strike of the ball.

====Holes and saucers====
* ''Holes'': The player directs the ball into a hole. On modern games, there are both vertical and horizontal holes (also called ''scoops''), and the game may include mechanisms to move the ball between them. On some older games, a "gobble hole" is sometimes included, usually awarding a large bonus or a game feature, but not giving the ball back.
* ''Saucers'': A shallow hole with a kicker inside. The ball remains visible on the playfield and is kicked out either straight up (usually into a duct or rail chute) or sideways back onto the playfield.

Originally holes and saucers worked by using tubes behind the playing field, with a pin at the top to hold the ball for later drops. Another version of the tube uses two spinning wheels to transfer the ball from hole to hole. Newer versions use an electronic track with a carriage or an electromagnet to pull the ball between holes.

====Spinners and rollovers====
[[File:Pinball Roll Over Targets - Demolition Man.JPG|thumb|upright|Rollovers detect when the ball passes over them]]
* ''Spinners'': A ball can push through a flat surface that is hinged in the middle, causing it to spin; each rotation adds points.
* ''Rollovers'': These are targets activated when a ball rolls over them. Often a series of rollover targets are placed side-by-side and with dividers between them forming "lanes"; the player must guide the ball to particular lanes (or to all lanes) in order to complete an objective. Such lanes are frequently placed at the bottom sides of the playfield: "inlanes" feed the ball back to the flippers, "outlanes" cause the ball to immediately drain. On many machines, outlanes can have extra balls or "specials" lit to act in the same role as the older gobble holes.
* ''Whirlwind Spinner(s)'': Used in some games, a whirlwind spinner is a rapidly rotating (often rubberized) disk on the playfield that momentarily "grabs" the ball and throws it in a random direction. Some games couple a whirlwind spinner with a magnet placed in the center, although DataEast seems to be the only manufacturer to do so. Bally's "Fireball" and Chicago Coin's "Casino" were popular games with a whirlwind spinner.

====Switches, gates, and stoppers====
* ''Switch'': A switch is an area that is blocked off after the ball passes through it once. An example of this is the initial firing lane: as a ball passes through the firing lane, it hits a switch and cannot reenter that chute.
* ''Gate'': This is a block that will allow balls to come through one way but will block the ball if it is going the other way.
* ''Stopper'': Also called a ''magic post'', this is a small pole most often found centered between and just below the lowest set of flippers and also rarely next to the outlanes. When activated (typically by hitting a specific target or targets), the pole ascends from inside the machine, blocking the area between the flippers for a limited time, making it more difficult to drain and lose the ball. After time expires, it returns to its resting place just below the playfield.

====Ramps====
[[File:Pinball Wire Ramp - Demolition Man.JPG|thumbnail|upright|A wire ramp along which the ball can travel]]
Ramps are inclined planes with a gentle enough slope that the ball may travel along it. The player attempts to direct the ball with enough force to make it to the top of the ramp and down the other side. If the player succeeds, a "ramp shot" has been made. Ramps frequently end in such a way that the ball goes to a flipper so one can make several ramp shots in a row. Often, the number of ramp shots scored in a game is tallied, and reaching certain numbers may lead to various game features. At other times, the ramps will go to smaller "mini-playfields" (small playfields, usually raised above the main game surface, with special goals or scoring).

====Toys, magnets and captive balls====
* ''Toys'': Toys are various items on, above, or beneath the playfield (items beneath the playfield visible through windows) or attached to the cabinet (usually to the backbox). Usually, each toy is unique to the machine it was made for, and reflects the theme of the game. They may be visual only, and have no effect on game play; they may be alternate ways of performing common game functions (for example, instead of using a drop hole to hold the ball, a hand or claw might reach out, grab the ball, and capture it that way); or they may be an integral part of the game rules and play (for instance, having a smaller playfield over the main playfield that can be tilted right and left by the player, using the flipper buttons).
* ''Electromagnets'': Some machines feature electrically operated magnets below the playfield to affect the ball's speed and/or trajectory according to the current state of game play. This may be done to make the ball's movement unpredictable, to temporarily halt the ball (as a ball saver, for example), or to otherwise control the ball by non-mechanical means. Electromagnets may also be used in above-playfield elements (often as part of the playfield toys) to grab the ball and move it elsewhere (onto a mini-playfield, for example). The Williams machine ''The Twilight Zone'' featured a mini-playfield that used electromagnets controlled by the flipper buttons, allowing the player to flip the ball on the mini-playfield, essentially working as invisible flippers. Contrary to somewhat popular myth, there are no professionally produced pinball machines known to contain magnets under the playfield intended to clandestinely make game play harder or increase ball losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdb.org/glossary.php#Playfield_Magnets |title=Pinball Glossary |publisher=Ipdb.org |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Captive balls'': Sometimes a ball is allowed to move around only within a confined area. A typical application of this is having a short lane on the playfield with a narrow opening, inside which a captive ball is held. The player can strike this captive ball with the ball in play, pushing it along the lane to activate a rollover switch or target. In games such as ''Theatre of Magic'', captive balls sometimes have what's called a "Newton Ball," which is a stationary ball adjacent to a free ball in a small lane. The ball being played strikes the Newton ball which, in turn, transfers its momentum to the adjacent ball, which causes it to move.

====Common features====
There are other idiosyncratic features on many pinball playfields. Pinball games have become increasingly complex and multiple play modes, multi-level playfields, and even progression through a rudimentary "plot" have become common features on recent games. Pinball scoring objectives can be quite complex and require a series of targets to be hit in a particular order. Recent pinball games are distinguished by increasingly complex rule sets that require a measure of strategy and planning by the player for maximum scoring. Players seeking highest scores would be well-advised to study the placard (usually found in the lower-left corner of the playfield) to learn each game's specific patterns required for these advanced features and scoring.

Common features in modern pinball games include the following:
* ''Ball lock'': Each time a ball goes into a specific hole or target, it is locked, and a new ball appears at the plunger. When the player has locked the required number of balls (often three), the multiball feature starts. On some games, the balls are physically locked in place by solenoid-actuated gates, but many newer machines use virtual ball locks instead, in which the game merely keeps count of the number of locked balls and then auto-launches them from the main ball trough when it is time for them to be released.
* ''Multiball'': This occurs when there is more than one ball in play at a time and usually includes some kind of jackpot scoring. Multiball ends when all but one ball is lost down the bottom of the playfield, and then regular play resumes.
* ''Jackpot'': Some targets on the playfield increase the scoring value of something else, which could be as simple as hitting a ramp, or a complicated sequence of targets. Upon their inception, the jackpot was the main goal of most pinball machines in the 1980s. Jackpots would often range from one to four million (back when this was a significant addition to the score), and their value would accrue between games until it was scored. Scoring it was usually a complicated task. Modern games often dilute the meaning of "jackpot". Modern games give off several jackpots in each multiball mode, which is usually quite easy to attain, and the value of today's jackpots is far less significant. Many jackpots awarded during special modes often do not increase at all, but are instead simply fixed-value bonuses.
* ''End-of-ball bonus'': After each ball is played, the player scores bonus points depending on how many times certain features have been activated or the numbers of items that the player may obtain. Some games award a seemingly arbitrary number of points that depend on the number of times ''any'' switch has been hit. Virtually all games have the ability to assign a multiplier to the bonus. Most games cap the bonus multiplier at 5x or 10x, although more modern games apparently have no limit.
* ''Extra ball'': If a player has earned this, when they lose a ball they get another one to play immediately afterward and the machine does not count the lost ball towards the limit of balls for that game. For example, if the player were on ball two and they earn an extra ball, the next ball will still be counted as ball two instead of the third ball. When a machine says "SHOOT AGAIN" on the scoreboard, it signifies that an extra ball will shoot. In a multiplayer game, the player who just lost the ball is the same one to shoot again.
* ''Kickback'': When a ball goes into one of the outlanes the ball instead of draining goes into a kicker that will launch the ball back into play. Their use is limited and has to be earned to be used.
* Various timed rounds (''modes''): For example, if the player hit a specific target three times within the next 20 seconds, they might score several tens of millions of points for it. There are many and various time-related features in pinball. Progression through each mode is frequently accompanied by [[Dot-matrix display|DMD]] animations and sound.
*''Stackability'': To ''stack'' means that the player can run one play mode while another mode is in progress. This strategy usually yields higher scores. A noted example of this is Williams'  ''Bram Stoker's Dracula'', with its Multi-Multiball feature.
* ''Wizard Mode'': This is a special scoring mode, which is reached after meeting certain prerequisites to access this mode (e.g., finishing all modes). This is the pinball equivalent of the final [[boss (video gaming)|boss fight]] in video games. Classic examples of this include Williams' [[Black Knight (pinball)|''Black Knight 2000'']] (The King's Ransom) and Midway's [[Twilight Zone (pinball)|''Twilight Zone'']] (Lost in the Zone). Named after The Who's song "[[Pinball Wizard]]". Wizard modes come in two varieties: goal-oriented types where the player receives a huge number of points after completing a specific task, or multiball modes with 4–6 balls in play, and virtually every feature active. Some games offer both and award the latter as a condition for completing the former.
* ''Ball Saver'': Many modern games include a feature that prevents a player from being disappointed if a ball sent into play quickly drains before substantial points have been added. This player will immediately be given another (free) ball to compensate. Electromechanical games made during the 1970s had a similar Ball Index switch system that returned a drained ball if no points were made.
* ''Slam Tilt'': There are special tilt switches placed on the underside of the playfield, on the coin door, and (on electromechanical games) in the lower cabinet and upper cabinet, designed to prevent cheating. If a player lifts and drops, pounds, or kicks the machine and activates any slam tilt, the entire game ends immediately for all players and may go into a reset/reboot mode. These are also used on video games. A similar Incline Tilt prevents a player from lifting the front of the cabinet to tip the ball back up the playfield by ending his turn.

====Unique features====
In the 1990s, game designers often put hidden, recurring images or references in their games, which became known as [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hem.bredband.net/b257182/Cows&amp;Easter.htm |title=Pinball Cows and Easter Eggs page |publisher=Hem.bredband.net |date=October 25, 1999 |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Williams' designers hid cows in the video displays of the games, and [[Pat Lawlor]] would place a red button in the artwork of games he developed. The methods used to find the hidden items usually involved pressing the flipper buttons in a certain order or during specific events.

Designers also included hidden messages or in-jokes; one example of this is the phrase "DOHO" sometimes seen quickly displayed on the dot matrix displays, a reference to '''Do'''rris '''Ho''', the wife of then-Williams display artist Scott "Matrix" Slomiany. DOHO was popularly thought to be an acronym for '''D'''ocumented '''O'''ccurrence of a '''H'''idden '''O'''bject until its true meaning was revealed in a ''[[PinGame Journal]]'' article on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bucher|first=Matthias|title=DOHO: Solving A Pinball Mystery|journal=PinGame Journal|date=March 2004|issue=103|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation (pinball)|Star Trek:The Next Generation]]'' went so far as to embed a hidden ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]''-like game, available only after a complex sequence of events had been accomplished during the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Dwight|title=Hidden Brick Game in ST:TNG|journal=PinGame Journal|date=March 2004|issue=103|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backglass===
[[File:JungleLord Backglass.JPG|thumb|The backglass from ''[[Jungle Lord (pinball)|Jungle Lord]]'', a 1981 pinball game]]
The ''backglass'' is a vertical graphic panel mounted on the front of the backbox, which is the upright box at the top back of the machine. The backglass contains the name of the machine, eye-catching [[graphics]], (usually) the score displays (lights, mechanical wheels, an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] display, or a [[Dot-matrix display|dot-matrix]] display depending on the era), and sometimes a mechanical device tied to game play, for example, elevator doors that opened on an image or a woman swatting a cat with a broom such as on Williams' 1989 "Bad Cats". For older games, the backglass image is screen printed in layers on the reverse side of a piece of glass; in more recent games, the image is imprinted into a translucent piece of plastic-like material called a translite which is mounted behind a piece of glass and which is easily removable. The earliest games did not have backglasses or backboxes and were little more than playfields in boxes. Games are generally built around a particular theme, such as a sport or character and the backglass art reflects this theme to attract the attention of players. Recent machines are typically tied into other enterprises such as a popular [[film|film series]], toy, or [[brand name]]. The entire machine is designed to be as eye-catching as possible to attract players and their money; every possible space is filled with colorful graphics, blinking lights, and themed objects, and the backglass is usually the first artwork the players see from a distance. Since the artistic value of the backglass may be quite impressive, it is not uncommon for enthusiasts to use a deep frame around a backglass (lighted from behind) and hang it as art after the remainder of the game is discarded.

==Scoring points==
[[File:Pinball Dot Matrix Display - Demolition Man.JPG|thumb|Dot Matrix Display]]
Contact with or manipulation of scoring elements (such as targets or ramps) scores points for the player. Electrical switches embedded in the scoring elements detect contact and relay this information to the scoring mechanism. Older pinball machines used an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] system for scoring wherein a pulse from a switch would cause a complex mechanism composed of [[relay]]s to ratchet up the score. In later games these tasks have been taken over by [[semiconductor]] chips and displays are made on electronic segmented or [[dot-matrix display]]s (DMD). The first DMD on a pinball machine was used by ''[[Checkpoint (pinball)|Checkpoint]]'' and features also video mode [[minigame]]s.&lt;ref name=TPC&gt;{{cite book |last=Shalhoub |first=Michael |date= |title=The Pinball Compendium: 1982 to Present |url= |location= |publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Limited |page=132 |isbn=9780764341076 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPB&gt;{{cite book |last=Rossignoli |first=Marco |date= |title=The Complete Pinball Book: Collecting the Game and Its History |url= |location= |publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Limited |page=225 |isbn=9780764337857 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hld&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homeleisuredirect.com/pinball-machines/buying-advice/what-are-dot-matrix-display-pinball-machines.html |title=What are Dot Matrix Display (DMD) Pinball Machines? |last1=Beresford |first1=Andy |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmigaming.com/pinballhistory.htm |title=The History Of Pinball Machines |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=Home Leisure Direct Website |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; MarsaPlay in Spain manufactured a remake of [[Inder (company)|Inder's]] original ''Canasta'' titled ''New Canasta'', with an [[LCD]] screen in the backbox in 2010.&lt;ref name="ipdb.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vendingtimes.com"/&gt;'' [[The Wizard of Oz (pinball)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' is the first US pinball machine that used a [[LCD]] in the back box.

Pinball scoring can be peculiar and varies greatly from machine to machine. During the 1930s and the 1940s, lights mounted behind the painted backglasses were used for scoring purposes, making the scoring somewhat arbitrary. (Frequently the lights represented scores in the hundreds of thousands.) Then later, during the 1950s and 1960s when the scoring mechanism was limited to mechanical wheels, high scores were frequently only in the hundreds ''or'' thousands. (Although, in an effort to keep with the traditional high scores attained with the painted backglass games, the first pinball machines to use mechanical wheels for scoring, such as ''Army Navy'', allowed the score to reach into the millions by adding a number of permanent zeros to the end of the score.) The average score changed again in the 1970s with the advent of electronic displays. Average scores soon began to commonly increase back into tens or hundreds of thousands. Since then, there has been a trend of scoring inflation, with modern machines often requiring scores of over a billion points to win a free game. At the peak of this trend, two machines, ''Johnny Mnemonic'' and ''[[Attack from Mars]]'', have been played into the trillions{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Another recent curiosity is the 1997 Bally game ''[[NBA Fastbreak (pinball)|NBA Fastbreak]]'' which, true to its theme, awards points in terms of a real basketball score: Each successful shot can give from one to three points. Getting a hundred points by the end of a game is considered respectable, which makes it one of the ''lowest'' scoring pinball machines of all time. The inflated scores are the source of one of the Spanish-language names of pinball machines, ''máquina del millón'' ("million machine").

===Special scores===
* [[High score]] lists: If a player attains one of the highest scores ever (or the highest score on a given day), they are invited to add their initials to a displayed list of high-scorers on that particular machine. "Bragging rights" associated with being on the high-score list are a powerful incentive for experienced players to master a new machine.
Pinball designers also entice players with the chance to win an extra game or ''replay''. Ways to get a replay might include the following:
* ''Replay Score'': An extra game is rewarded if the player exceeds a specified score. Some machines allow the operator to set this score to increase with each consecutive game in which the replay score is achieved, in order to prevent a skilled player from gaining virtually unlimited play on one credit by simply achieving the same replay score in every game.
* ''Special'': A mechanism to get an extra game during play is usually called a "special." Typically, some hard-to-reach feature of the game will light the outlanes (the areas to the extreme left and right of the flippers) for special. Since the outlanes always lose the ball, having "special" there makes it worth shooting for them (and is usually the only time, if this is the case).
* ''Match'': At the end of the game, if a set digit of the player's score matches a random digit, an extra game is rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Match|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier machines, the set digit was usually the [[ones place]]; after a phenomenon often referred to as ''score inflation'' had happened (causing almost all scores to end in 0), the set digit was usually the tens place. The chances of a match appear to be 1 in 10, but the operator can alter this probability – the default is usually 7% in all modern Williams and Bally games for example. Other non-numeric methods are sometimes used to award a match.
* ''High Score'': Most machines award 1–3 bonus games if a player gets on the high score list. Typically, one or two credits are awarded for a 1st–4th place listing, and three for the Grand Champion.

When an extra game is won, the machine typically makes a single loud bang, most often with a [[solenoid]] that strikes a piece of metal, or the side of the cabinet, with a rod, known as a ''knocker'', or less commonly with [[loudspeaker]]s. "Knocking" is the act of winning an extra game when the knocker makes the loud and distinctive noise.

==Playing techniques==
The primary skill of pinball involves application of the proper timing and technique to the operation of the flippers, nudging the playfield when appropriate without tilting, and choosing targets for scores or features. A skilled player can quickly "learn the angles" and gain a high level of control of ball motion, even on a machine they have never played. Skilled players can often play on a machine for long periods of time on a single coin. By earning extra balls, a single game can be stretched out for a long period, and if the player is playing well he or she can earn replays known as "specials."

A placard is usually placed in a lower corner of the playfield. It may simply show pricing information, but should also show critical details about special scoring techniques. This information is vital to achieving higher scores; it typically describes a series of events that must take place (e.g., shoot right ramp and left drop targets to light 'extra ball' rollover). Learning these details makes the game more fun and challenging. With practice — and a machine in good operating condition — a player can often achieve specific targets and higher scores and trigger exciting events.

===Nudging===
Skillful players can influence the movement of the ball by moving or bumping the pinball machine, a technique known as "nudging." There are tilt mechanisms which guard against excessive manipulation of this sort. The mechanisms generally include:
* a grounded plumb bob centered in an electrified metal ring – when the machine is jostled or shaken too far or too hard, the bob contacts the ring, completing a circuit. The bob is usually cone-shaped allowing the operator to slide it vertically, controlling the sensitivity.
* an electrified ball on a slight ramp with a grounded post at the top of the ramp – when the front of the machine is lifted (literally, tilted) too high, the ball rolls to the top of the ramp and completes the circuit.
* an impact sensor – usually located on the coin door, the playfield and/or the cabinet itself.

When any of these sensors is activated, the game registers a "tilt" and locks out, disabling solenoids for the flippers and other playfield systems so that the ball can do nothing other than roll down the playfield directly to the drain. A tilt will usually result in loss of bonus points earned by the player during that ball; the game ends if it's the last ball and the player has no extra ball. Older games would immediately end the ball in play on a tilt. Modern games give tilt warnings before sacrificing the ball in play. The number of tilt warnings can be adjusted by the operator of the machine. Until recently most games also had a "slam tilt" switch which guarded against kicking or slamming the [[coin acceptor|coin mechanism]], or for overly aggressive behavior with the machine, which could give a false indication that a coin had been inserted, thereby giving a free game or credit. This feature was recently taken out by default in new [[Stern Pinball, Inc.|Stern]] S.A.M System games,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} but can be added as an option. A slam tilt will typically end the current game for all players.

===Trapping===
Skilled players can also hold a ball in place with the flipper, giving them more control over where they want to place the ball when they shoot it forward. This is known as ''trapping.'' This technique involves catching the ball in the corner between the base of the flipper and the wall to its side, just as the ball falls towards the flipper; the flipper is then released, which allows the ball to roll slowly downward against the flipper. The player then chooses the moment to hit the flipper again, timing the shot as the ball slides slowly against the flipper. Multi-ball games, in particular, reward trapping techniques. Usually this is done by trapping one or more balls out of play with one flipper, then using the other flipper to score points with the remaining ball or balls.

Once a player has successfully trapped a ball, they may then attempt to "juggle" the ball to the other flipper. This is done by tapping the flipper button quickly enough so that the trapped ball is knocked back at an angle of less than 90 degrees into the bottom of the nearest slingshot. The ball will then often bounce across the playfield to the other flipper, where the ball may then be hit (or trapped) by the opposite flipper.

Occasionally a pinball machine will have a pin or post placed directly between the two bottom flippers. When this feature is present, the advanced player may then attempt to perform a "chill maneuver" when the ball is heading directly toward the pin by opting ''not'' to hit a flipper. If successful, this will cause the ball to bounce up and back into play. A related move, the "dead flipper pass," is performed by ''not'' flipping when a ball is heading toward a flipper. If done properly, the ball will bounce off the "dead" flipper, across to the other flipper, where it may be trapped and controlled.

==Competitions==
Two Pinball World Championships were held in the Washington, DC area in 1972 and 1973 under the auspices of the World Pinball Association which also published a newsletter carrying results of regional tournaments.

In 1974, students at [[Jersey City State College]] wanted to make pinball playing a varsity school sport, like [[American football|football]] was, so they started a Pinball Club Team to compete against clubs at other schools. They asked two other schools to participate. [[Saint Peter's College (New Jersey)|St. Peter's College]] took up the challenge, while the other school did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.njcu.edu/Jvelasco/Documents/NJCU_Pinball_Wizards_1974.pdf |title=Article about the Jersey City State College pinball club |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514004141/http://faculty.njcu.edu/Jvelasco/Documents/NJCU_Pinball_Wizards_1974.pdf |archive-date=May 14, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pinball leagues have formed, with varying levels of competitiveness, formality and structure. These leagues exist everywhere from the Free State Pinball Association (FSPA) in the Washington, DC area to the Tokyo Pinball Organization (TPO)] in Japan. In the late 1990s, game manufacturers added messages to some games encouraging players to join a local league, providing website addresses for prospective league players to investigate.

Competitive pinball has become increasingly popular in recent years, with the relaunch of both the [[Professional and Amateur Pinball Association]] (PAPA) and the [[International Flipper Pinball Association]] (IFPA).

Two different systems for ranking pinball players exist. The World Pinball Player Rankings (WPPR) was created by the IFPA. The WPPR formula takes into account the quantity and quality of the players in the field, and awards points based on that calculation for the nearly 200 IFPA endorsed events worldwide. PAPA manages a ranking system known as the PAPA Advanced Rating System (PARS), which uses the [[Glicko Rating System]] to mathematically analyze the results of more than 100,000 competitive matches. Since 2008 the IFPA has held a World Championship tournament, inviting the top-ranked WPPR players to compete; the current title holder is Daniele Celestino Acciari of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifpapinball.com/view_tournament.php?t=584&amp;e=1&amp;d=2012-06-10 |title=International Flipper Pinball Association |publisher=Ifpapinball.com |date=June 10, 2012 |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAPA also designates the winner of the A Division in the annual PAPA World Pinball Championships as the World Pinball Champion; the current holder of this title is Keith Elwin from the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://papa.org/papa15/results.php |title=PAPA 15: Final Results |publisher=Papa |date= |accessdate=April 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505014142/http://www.papa.org/papa15/results.php |archive-date=May 5, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current Junior (16 and under) and Senior (50 and over) World Champions are Joshua Henderson and Paul McGlone, respectively. Samuel Ogden has become one of the most memorable champions in the PAPA tournaments, winning four straight competitions from 2004-2008 in the 50 and over category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://papa.org/|title=PAPA.ORG – The Professional &amp; Amateur Pinball Association|website=papa.org|language=English|access-date=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing process==
{{Tone|section|date=February 2010}}
The first part of a pinball machine's construction involves the wiring for the game's electronic system. A color-coded wiring arrangement is wrapped around pins and connectors on a circuit board. Technicians then follow through using a meticulous set of instructions to ensure that the almost-half mile of wire is engineered properly. During this time the playing field is set onto foam strips and a bed of nails. The nails are then pressed in the playing board as the bed raises and compresses them against the header. Afterward anchors come and are hammered into place. The anchors help secure a metal railing that keeps the balls from exiting the playing field.

After the main construction is processed, it then comes down to fitting a few lampposts, some plastic bumpers, and flashing lights. All of the wiring is permanently fastened and speakers are bolted into the cabinet. Along with this comes the most crucial tool, the spring power plunger, which is set into place.

Finally, a few other toys and gimmicks are added, such as toy villains and other small themed characters. Once everything is tested and seems to be running alright, the playfield is set on top of the lower box. The lower box on computerized games is essentially empty. On older electromechanical games, the entire floor of the lower box was used to mount custom relays and special scoring switches, making older games much heavier. To protect the top of the playfield, a tempered glass window is installed, secured by a metal bar that is locked into place. The expensive, unique, painted vertical backglass is fragile. The backglass covers the custom microprocessor boards on newer games, or electromechanical scoring wheels on older games. On older games, a broken backglass might be impossible to replace, ruining the game's appeal.

===Solenoids===
* ''Solenoids or coils'': These are found in every modern pinball machine since the flipper age. They are usually hidden under the playfield, or covered by playfield components. By applying power to the coil, the magnetic field created by electromagnetism causes a metal object (usually called a plunger) to move. The plunger is then connected mechanically to a feature or accessory on the playfield.

Flipper solenoids contain two coil windings in one package; a short, heavy gage 'power' winding to give the flipper its initial thrust up, and a long, light gage 'hold' winding that uses lower power (and creates far less heat) and essentially just holds the flipper up allowing the player to capture the ball in the inlane for more precise aiming. As the flipper nears the end of its upward travel, a switch under the flipper disconnects the power-winding and leaves only the second sustain winding to hold the flipper up in place. If this switch fails 'open' the flipper will be too weak to be usable, since only the weak winding is available. If it fails 'closed' the coil will overheat and destroy itself, since both windings will hold the flipper at the top of its stroke.

Solenoids also control pop-bumpers, kickbacks, drop target resets, and many other features on the machine. These solenoid coils contain a single coil winding. The plunger size and wire gage &amp; length are matched to the strength required for each coil to do its work, so some types are repeated throughout the game, some are not.

All solenoids and coils used on microprocessor games include a special reverse-biased diode to eliminate a high-voltage pulse of reverse EMF ([[electromotive force]]). Without this diode, when the solenoid is de-energized, the magnetic field that was built up in the coil collapses and generates a brief, high-voltage pulse backward into the wiring, capable of destroying the solid-state components used to control the solenoid. Proper wiring polarity must be retained during coil replacement or this diode will act as a dead short, immediately destroying electronic switches. Older electromechanical AC game solenoids do not require this diode, since they were controlled with mechanical switches. However, electromechanical games running on DC do require diodes to protect the rectifier&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://homepinballrepair.com/pinballflipperrepair.html|title=Pinball Flippers Rebuilding|website=homepinballrepair.com|access-date=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

All but very old games use low DC voltages to power the solenoids and electronics (or relays). Some microprocessor games use high voltages (potentially hazardous) for the score displays. Very early games used low-voltage AC power for solenoids, requiring fewer components, but AC is less efficient for powering solenoids, causing heavier wiring and slower performance. For locations that suffer from low AC wall outlet voltage, additional taps may be provided on the AC transformer in electromechanical games to permit raising the game's DC voltage levels, thus strengthening the solenoids. Microprocessor games have electronic power supplies that automatically compensate for inaccurate AC supply voltages.

Historically, pinball machines have employed a central fixed I/O board connected to the primary CPU controlled by a custom microcontroller platform running an in-house operating system. For a variety of reasons that include thermal flow, reliability, vibration reduction and serviceability, I/O electronics have been located in the upper backbox of the game, requiring significant custom wiring harnesses to connect the central I/O board to the playfield devices.

A typical pinball machine I/O mix includes 16 to 24 outputs for driving solenoids, motors, electromagnets and other mechanical devices in the game. These devices can draw up to 500 W momentarily and operate at voltages up to 50 Vdc. There is also individually controlled lighting that consists of 64 to 96 individually addressable lights. Recently developed games have switched from incandescent bulbs to LEDs. And there is general illumination lighting that comprises two or more higher-power light strings connected and controlled in parallel for providing broad illumination to the playfield and backbox artwork. Additionally, 12 to 24 high-impulse lighting outputs, traditionally incandescent but now LED, provide flash effects within the game. Traditionally, these were often controlled by solenoid-level drivers.

A game typically includes 64 to 96 TTL-level inputs from a variety of sensors such as mechanical leaf switches, optical sensors and electromagnetic sensors. Occasionally extra signal conditioning is necessary to adapt custom sensors, such as eddy sensors, to the system TTL inputs.

Recently, some pinball manufacturers have replaced some of the discrete control wiring with standard communication buses. In one case, the pinball control system might include a custom embedded network node bus, a custom embedded Linux-based software stack, and a 48-V embedded power distribution system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designworldonline.com/advanced-networks-make-pinball-games-pop/#_|title=Advanced networks make pinball games pop! |publisher=Design World Magazine |date= |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer pinball simulation==
Simulating a pinball machine has also been a popular theme of video games. Early pinball video games include [[Toru Iwatani]]'s [[Namco]] [[arcade game]]s ''[[Gee Bee (video game)|Gee Bee]]'' (1978), ''[[Bomb Bee]]'' (1979), and ''[[Cutie Q]]'' (1979),&lt;ref name="kohler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohler|first=Chris|title=[[Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life]]|year=2016|pages=[https://www.scribd.com/read/327139764/Power-Up-How-Japanese-Video-Games-Gave-the-World-an-Extra-Life 51–2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Atari 2600]] game ''[[Video Pinball]]'' (1980), and ''[[David's Midnight Magic]]'' (1982). Most famous on home computers was [[Bill Budge]]'s ''[[Pinball Construction Set]]'', released for the [[Apple II]] in 1983. ''Pinball Construction Set'' was the first program that allowed the user to create their own simulated pinball machine and then play it.

Most early simulations were top-down [[2D computer graphics|2D]]. As [[central processing unit|processor]] and graphics capabilities have improved, more accurate ball physics and [[dimension|3D]] pinball simulations have become possible. Tilting has also been simulated, which can be activated using one or more keys (sometimes the space bar) for "moving" the machine. Flipper button computer peripherals were also released, allowing pinball fans to add an accurate feel to their game play instead of using the [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] or [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]. Modern pinball video games are often based around established franchises such as ''[[Metroid Prime Pinball]]'', ''[[Super Mario Ball]]'', ''[[Pokémon Pinball]]'', ''[[Kirby's Pinball Land]]'', and ''[[Sonic Spinball]]''.

Popular pinball games of the 1990s include ''[[Pinball Dreams]]'', ''[[Pro Pinball]]'' and ''[[Full Tilt! Pinball|3D Pinball: Space Cadet]]'' that was included in [[Windows Me]] and [[Windows XP]]. More recent examples include ''[[Pinball FX]]'', ''[[Pinball FX 2]]'', and ''[[Pinball FX 3]]''.

There have been [[:Category:Pinball video games|pinball programs]] released for all major home video game and computer systems, [[tablet computer]]s and [[smart phone]]s. Pinball video game engines and editors for creation and recreation of pinball machines include for instance ''[[Visual Pinball]]'', ''[[Future Pinball]]'' and ''[[Unit3D Pinball]]''.

A [[BBC News]] article described virtual pinball games e.g. ''[[Zen Pinball]]'' and ''[[The Pinball Arcade]]'' as a way to preserve pinball culture and bring it to new audiences.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|last=Rubens |first=Paul |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26018682 |title=BBC News - Virtual games bring pinball to new audiences |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=February 3, 2014 |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of preserving historic pinball machines is ''[[Zaccaria (company)#Digital recreations|Zaccaria Pinball]]'' that consists of digital recreations of classic [[Zaccaria (company)|Zaccaria]] pinball machines.

==Custom pinball machines==
[[File:A rebuilt Terminator 2 pinball machine.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Terminator 2: Judgment Day (pinball)|''Terminator 2'' pinball machine]] restored to better than factory condition e.g. by re-plating of all metal parts with [[chrome plating|chrome]]]]
Some hobbyists and small companies modify existing pinball machines or create their own custom pinball machines. Some want, for example, a game with a specific subject or theme that cannot be bought in this form or was never built at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnwpinball.com/projects.htm|title=Pacific Northwest Pinball - Custom Pinball Projects|publisher=|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some custom games are built by using the programmable P-ROC controller board.&lt;ref name=arscustom&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/the-custom-pinball-machines-of-chicagos-pinball-expo-2013/|title=The custom pinball machines of Chicago’s Pinball Expo 2013|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modifications include the use of ColorDMD that is used to replace the standard mono color [[dot-matrix display]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.performancepinball.com/news/color-dmd-new-and-improved|title=Pinball and car news, tech and resources - Performance Pinball|publisher=|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the addition of features, e.g. figures or other toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeplayamusements.com/boogie.htm|title=Scared Stiff Pinball Dancing Boogiemen Kit|publisher=|accessdate=April 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209112219/http://freeplayamusements.com/boogie.htm|archive-date=February 9, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few notable examples of custom pinball machines include a ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' theme machine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghostbustersnews.com/2012/09/25/10508/|title=Fan Creation: Ghostbusters Pinball Machine|publisher=|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]'' style game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szBLqjyffnQ|title=Pinball News - The Matrix at the Dutch Pinball Open 2012|date=October 9, 2012|work=YouTube|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Paxton]] Pinball,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benheck.com/bill-paxton-pinball/|title=Bill Paxton Pinball: The Official Site|publisher=|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic]]'', ''[[Star Fox]]'', and ''[[Predators (film)|Predator]]'' machines.&lt;ref name=arscustom /&gt;

[[Data East]] was one of few regular pinball company that manufactured custom pinball games (e.g. for [[Aaron Spelling]], [[Michael Jordan]] and the movie ''[[Richie Rich (film)|Richie Rich]]''), though these were basically mods of existing or soon to be released pinball machines (e.g. ''[[Lethal Weapon 3 (pinball)|Lethal Weapon 3]]'' or ''[[The Who's Tommy Pinball Wizard]]'').

==In popular culture==
Pinball games have frequently been featured in [[popular culture]], often as a symbol of rebellion or toughness. Perhaps the most famous instance is the [[rock opera]] album ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]'' (1969) by [[The Who]], which centers on the title character, a "deaf, dumb, and blind kid", who becomes a "[[Pinball Wizard]]" and who later uses pinball as a symbol and tool for his messianic mission. (The album was subsequently made into a [[Tommy (1975 film)|movie]] and [[The Who's Tommy|stage musical]].) ''Wizard'' has since moved into popular usage as a term for an expert pinball player. Things came full circle in 1975 when Bally created the ''Wizard!'' pinball game featuring [[Ann-Margret]] and The Who's [[Roger Daltrey]] on the backglass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=2803 |title=Internet Pinball Machine Database: Bally 'Wizard!' |publisher=Ipdb.org |date= |accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the movie version, Tommy plays a Gottlieb ''Kings and Queens'' machine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=1381 |title=Internet Pinball Machine Database: Gottlieb 'Kings &amp; Queens' |publisher=Ipdb.org |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while The Champ plays a Gottlieb ''Buckaroo'' machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=393 |title=Internet Pinball Machine Database: Gottlieb 'Buckaroo' |publisher=Ipdb.org |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1976, Bally released ''Capt.Fantastic'', which had an image of Elton John on the backglass, playing pinball in a similar costume as used in the movie ''Tommy''. Data East produced ''[[The Who's Tommy Pinball Wizard]]'' in 1994, based on the rock musical ''The Who's Tommy''. This game is notable in its use of The Who's iconic songs, including "Pinball Wizard", sung by original Broadway cast members.

In the late 1970s the children's television series ''[[Sesame Street]]'' began airing a series of short animated segments, called the "[[Pinball Number Count]]". Each segment was different, and involved the ball rolling in different themed areas of a pinball machine depending on which number (from 1-12) was being featured. The animations were directed by Jeff Hale and featured music by Walt Kraemer and vocal work by the [[Pointer Sisters]].

In ''[[Pinball, 1973]]'', a novel by [[Haruki Murakami]], the protagonist is obsessed with pinball. One of the plot lines follows his attempts to find a pinball machine he used to play.

In 1975–76 there was a brief TV game show based on pinball called ''[[The Magnificent Marble Machine]]''.

''[[Tilt (1979 film)|Tilt]]'' is a 1979 drama film starring [[Brooke Shields]] as the protagonist, Tilt, a young pinball wizard.

''[[Nickelodeon]]'' used the pinball as their logo in the early 1980s. The words "Nickelodeon" were in rainbow colors against a huge pinball. This logo was used until 1984, when the orange splat logo took its place.

A '''playback singer''' is a singer whose singing is pre-recorded for use in movies. Playback singers record songs for [[soundtrack]]s, and actors or actresses [[lip-sync]] the songs for cameras; the actual singer does not appear on the screen. 

==South Asia==
[[South Asian cinema|South Asian movies]] produced in the Indian subcontinent are particularly known for using this technique. A majority of [[Cinema of India|Indian movies]] as well as [[Cinema of Pakistan|Pakistani movies]] typically include six or seven songs. After ''[[Alam Ara]]'' (1931), the first Indian [[talkie film]], for many years singers made dual recordings for a film, one during the shoot, and later in the recording studio, until 1952 or 1953. Popular playback singers in India enjoy the same status as popular actors, and music directors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolk |first=Douglas |date=April 1999 |title=Kill Your Radio: Music On The 'Net |journal=[[CMJ New Music]] |issue=Electro Media |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=D.

==Hollywood==
Playback singing is not as common in contemporary Hollywood as musicals are less frequent.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} It was, however, more widely used in the past. Notable [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] performances include [[Marni Nixon]] in ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' for [[Natalie Wood]]'s portrayal of Maria, in ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' for [[Deborah Kerr]]'s Anna Leonowens, and for [[Audrey Hepburn]]'s Eliza in ''[[My Fair Lady]]''; [[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]] singing for John Kerr's Lieutenant Cable in ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'' and for [[Christopher Plummer]]'s Captain von Trapp in ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/fullcredits|title=The Sound of Music full credits|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lindsay Ridgeway]] for [[Ashley Peldon]]'s character as Darla Dimple in the animated film ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]'', [[Claudia Brücken]] providing the singing voice for [[Erika Heynatz]]'s character as Elsa Lichtmann in ''[[L.A.

[[File:Comante Taunt.JPG|thumb|400px|[[Paul Muni]] (as Tony Camonte) taunting and laughing at police officers he has just shot at in the trailer for ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]] (1932)''. The Hays office wanted this ending of the gangster film replaced with one where Muni's character is tried and executed.]]

The era of American film production from the early sound era to the enforcement of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Code]] in 1934 is denoted as [[Pre-Code Hollywood]]. The era contained violence and crime in pictures which would not be seen again until decades later. Although the Hays office had specifically recommended removing profanity, the drug trade, and prostitution from pictures, it had never officially recommended against depictions of violence in any form in the 1920s. State censor boards, however, created their own guidelines, and New York in particular developed a list of violent material which had to be removed for a picture to be shown in the state. Two main types of crime films were released during the period: the gangster picture and the prison film.

A triumvirate of gangster pictures were released in the early 1930s—''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1931), ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (1931), and ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932)—which were built on the template created by the first gangster movie, 1927's ''[[Underworld (1927 film)|Underworld]]''. All featured the rise and eventual fall of an organized criminal. As described by crime film scholar Jack Shadoian the maxim became, "If the films insist that one can’t win, under that given it’s how you lose that counts."&lt;ref name="SH29"&gt;Shadoian. pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scarface'' was the most controversial and violent; the film took nearly a year to reach theaters due to battles with censors. Obviously based on the life of [[Al Capone]], ''Scarface'' and others like it outraged civic leaders who felt that movies were glorifying the lifestyles of criminals.

Stirred into action by the 1930 [[Ohio Penitentiary#Fire|Ohio penitentiary fire]], which resulted in 300 deaths when guards refused to let inmates out of their cells, Hollywood produced movies which depicted the harsh conditions in prisons at the time. The prototype of the prison genre was 1930's ''[[The Big House (1930 film)|The Big House]]''. The picture features future genre staples such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, an escape, and the codes of prison life. Never box office hits, prison pictures failed to attract the female audiences they needed to achieve financial success. The [[chain gang]] films were produced in a similar response to the callous inhumanity of the chain gang system which was prevalent among states in the southern US. The 1932 film ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'' is considered the seminal movie of the genre, and was based on [[I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang|the autobiography]] of [[Robert Elliott Burns|Robert E. Burns]] who was himself a fugitive at the time of the picture's release.

==Early crime films==

[[File:Great train robbery still.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A famous shot, of "Bronco Billy Anderson", from the 1903 film ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', the first "[[western (genre)|Western]]" ever filmed. Scenes where criminals aimed guns at the camera were considered inappropriate by the New York state censor board in the 1920s and usually removed.&lt;ref&gt;Prince. pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the early 1900s America was still primarily a rural country, especially in terms of self-identity.&lt;ref name="SS165"&gt;Siegel &amp; Siegel. pg. 165&lt;/ref&gt; [[D. W. Griffith]]’s 1912 film ''[[The Musketeers of Pig Alley]]'' is one of the earliest American films to feature urban organized crime.&lt;ref name="SH29"/&gt; Prohibition's arrival in 1920 created an environment where anyone who wanted to drink had to interact with criminals,&lt;ref&gt;Leitch. pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt; especially in urban areas. Nonetheless, the urban crime genre was ignored until 1927 when the film ''Underworld'', which is recognized as the first gangster movie,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dave Kehr|Kehr, Dave]]. [http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/underworld/Film?oid=1049074 Underworld], ''Chicago Reader'', accessed October 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; became a surprise hit. According to the ''Encyclopedia of Hollywood'''s entry on ''Underworld'', "The film established the fundamental elements of the gangster movie: a hoodlum hero; ominous, night-shrouded city streets; floozies; and a blazing finale in which the cops cut down the protagonist."&lt;ref name="SS178"&gt;Siegel &amp; Siegel. pg. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Other gangster films such as ''[[Thunderbolt (1929 film)|Thunderbolt]]'', ''[[Lights of New York (1928 film)|Lights of New York]]'', ''[[The Racket (1928 film)|The Racket]]'', and ''[[Doorway to Hell]]'' were released to capitalize on ''Underworld's'' popularity,&lt;ref name="SS178"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iz70"&gt;Izod. pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt; with ''Thunderbolt'' later described as "a virtual remake" of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by financial gain in an increasingly competitive film market, and motivated by the fact that provocative pictures sold tickets, these movies pushed the boundaries of film violence.&lt;ref name="Iz70"/&gt; Other late 1920s crime films depicted organized crime on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and investigated the connection between mobsters and Broadway productions in films such as 1929's ''[[Tenderloin (film)|Tenderloin]]'' and ''[[Broadway (1929 film)|Broadway]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes. pg. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hays Office had never recommended banning violence in any form in the 1920s—unlike profanity, the drug trade or prostitution—but advised that it be dealt with carefully.&lt;ref name="Pr20"&gt;Prince. pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; New York's censor board was the most active board of any state, reviewing around all but 50 of the country's 1,000–1,300 annual releases.&lt;ref&gt;Prince. pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927–8 the violent scenes they most removed were all instances where the gun was pointed at the camera, some instances where guns were pointed "at or into the body of another character", many shots where machine guns were featured, scenes where criminals shot at law enforcement officers, some scenes involving stabbing or knife brandishing (stabbings were considered more disturbing than shootings by audiences), most whippings, several involving choking, torture, or electrocution, and scenes which could be considered educational in their depiction of crime methods.&lt;ref&gt;Prince. pgs. 23–8&lt;/ref&gt; Sadistic violence, and reaction shots showing the faces of individuals on the receiving end of violence were considered especially sensitive areas.&lt;ref&gt;Prince. pgs. 27–8&lt;/ref&gt; The Code later recommended against scenes showing  "robbery", "theft", "safe-cracking", "arson", "the use of firearms", "dynamiting of trains, machines, and buildings", and "brutal killings" on the basis that they would be rejected by local censors.&lt;ref name="Pr30"&gt;Prince. pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Westerns==
[[Justus D. Barnes]], was "Bronco Billy Anderson", leader of an outlaw gang, from the [[silent film]], ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), the first, "[[Western (genre)|Western]]", ever filmed. The Western was a subgenre, of crime films. Scenes where criminals aimed guns at the camera, were considered inappropriate by many state censor boards, in the pre-Code and Code era, and were removed from public viewing.

==Birth of the Hollywood gangster==
{{quote|No motion picture genre of the Pre-Code era was more incendiary than the gangster film; neither preachment yarns nor vice films so outraged the moral guardians or unnerved the city fathers as the high caliber scenarios that made screen heroes out of stone killers.&lt;ref name="DH139"/&gt;|Pre-Code historian Thomas Doherty}}

In the early 1930s, several real life criminals became celebrities. Two in particular captured the American imagination: [[Al Capone]] and [[John Dillinger]]. Gangsters like Capone had transformed the perception of entire towns.&lt;ref name="DH139"&gt;Doherty. pg. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Capone gave Chicago its "reputation as the locus classicus of American gangsterdom, a cityscape where bullet-proof roadsters with tommygun-toting hoodlums on running boards careened around State Street spraying fusillades of slugs into flower shop windows and mowing down the competition in blood-spattered garages."&lt;ref name="DH139"/&gt; Capone appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1930.&lt;ref name="DH139"/&gt; He was even offered seven figure sums by two major Hollywood studios to appear in a film but declined.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Dillinger became a national celebrity as a bank robber who eluded arrest and escaped confinement several times. He had become the most celebrated public outlaw since [[Jesse James]].&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 137&lt;/ref&gt; His father appeared in a popular series of newsreels giving police homespun advice on how to catch his son. Dillinger's popularity rose so fast that ''Variety'' joked "if Dillinger remains at large much longer and more such interviews are obtained, there may be some petitions circulated to make him our president."&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Hays wrote a cablegram to all the studios in March 1934 decreeing that Dillinger should not be portrayed in any motion picture.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pgs. 137-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1931, the same month as the release of ''The Public Enemy'', Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct a study on the effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and actually too favorable in their depiction of the police.&lt;ref name="Bl123"&gt;Black. pg. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry,&lt;ref name="Bl123"/&gt; the New York State censorship board was not impressed and from 1930 to 1932 removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Smith. pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the factors that made gangster pictures so subversive was that in the difficult economic times of the Depression there already existed the viewpoint that the only way to get financial success was through crime.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Many were convinced they would lead to higher rates of juvenile delinquency.&lt;ref&gt;Springhall. pg. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Kansas City Times]]'' argued that while adults may not be affected by these films, they were "misleading, contaminating, and often demoralizing to children and youth."&lt;ref&gt;Black. pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Exacerbating the problem, local theater owners advertised gangster pictures with a singular irresponsibility.&lt;ref name="DH153"&gt;Doherty. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Theaters displayed tommy guns and [[Baton (law enforcement)|blackjacks]] and real-life murders were tied into promotions. The situation reached such a nexus that the studios had to ask exhibitors to tone down the gimmickry in their promotions.&lt;ref name="DH153"/&gt;

The genre entered a new level following the 1931 release of ''Little Caesar''. The film featured [[Edward G. Robinson]] in a career defining performance as gangster Rico Bandello.&lt;ref name="SS178"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegel &amp; Siegel. pg. 359&lt;/ref&gt; ''Caesar'', along with ''The Public Enemy'' starring [[James Cagney]], and ''Scarface'' featuring [[Paul Muni]], were incredibly violent films that created a new type of anti-hero. Driven by the performance of one protagonist, they were considered "actors' vehicles".&lt;ref&gt;Shadoian. pg. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Nine gangster films were released in 1930, 26 in 1931, 28 in 1932, and 15 in 1933, when the genre's popularity began to subside after the end of Prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;Black. pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt; The backlash against gangster pictures was swift. In 1931 Jack L. Warner announced that his studio would stop making them, and that he had never let his 15-year-old son see one.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch. pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Little Caesar''===
[[File:Caesar2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Rico ([[Edward G. Robinson]]) confronting Joe ([[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]]) when Joe wants to leave the mob in ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1931). The public's fascination with gangster films, in the early 1930s, was bolstered by, the constant [[newsreel]] appearances of, real-life criminals, like [[Al Capone]] and [[John Dillinger]], upon whom characters like Robinson's were often based.]]

Warner Brothers 28&amp;#8209;year&amp;#8209;old head of production [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] decided to make a gangster picture in 1930 after one of his close friends was killed by a bootlegger. He purchased the rights to the novel ''Little Caesar'' by Chicago reporter [[W. R. Burnett]] for $15,000. Burnett had penned the gangster story after seeing the aftermath of the Capone ordered [[Saint Valentine's Day massacre]].&lt;ref name="Vi30"&gt;Vieira. pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Generally considered the grandfather of gangster films,&lt;ref&gt;Dirks, Tim. [http://www.filmsite.org/littc.html Little Caesar], filmsite.org, accessed October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Caesar'', Robinson as Rico, and his close friend Joe Massara (played by [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]]), move to Chicago. Joe wants to go straight and meets a woman. Rico, however, seeks a life of crime and joins the gang of Sam Vettori, rising to the rank of boss in the crime family. After becoming concerned his friend will betray him, he threatens him, at which point Joe's girlfriend goes to the police. Unable to bring himself to kill Joe and thus eliminate the witness against him, Rico goes into hiding. He is coaxed out by the police who publish that he is a coward to the press, and Rico is shot and killed by the police. As he is dying, he says "Mother of mercy, is this the end of Rico?"&lt;ref name="Canby"&gt;Canby, Vincent.

The Rico character is not portrayed as admirable, and is shown to possess little intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Shadoian. pgs. 40–2&lt;/ref&gt; The picture has a simple, obvious storyline and is filmed in brighter images during Rico's triumphant rise, and at night and darkly shot during his fall.&lt;ref&gt;Shadoian. pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Among later film critics, Robinson's performances is frequently cited as the film's saving grace.&lt;ref&gt;Null, Christopher.

Caesar's success inspired MGM's ''[[The Secret Six]]'' and Fox's ''[[Quick Millions (1931 film)|Quick Millions]]'', and Paramount's ''[[City Streets (1931 film)|City Streets]]'', but the next big Hollywood gangster came from another Warner Brothers picture.&lt;ref name="Vi33"&gt;Vieira. pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Public Enemy''===
[[File:Grapefruit-james cagney-mae clark21a.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[James Cagney]] smashes a [[grapefruit]] into [[Mae Clarke]]'s face in ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (1931).]]

[[William Wellman]]'s ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (1931) was released by Warner Brothers the following year and features another career defining performance, this time by [[James Cagney]]. It was adapted from the unpublished novelette ''Beer and Blood'' written by [[John Bright (screenwriter)|John Bright]], and adapted for the screen by [[Kubec Glasmon]] and Bright.&lt;ref&gt;Grieveson, Sonnet, &amp; Stanfield. pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes. pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; ''Enemy'' takes place from 1909 until 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes. pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The film is similar to the template set in ''Caesar'' in that it follows Tom Powers (Cagney) from his rise to his eventual fall in the world of crime. Cagney's character contrasts his puritanical brother who wants him to go straight and their mother, who is at the center of the conflict between her two sons. Tom Powers is egotistical, amoral, heartless, and extremely violent.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk, Tim. [http://www.filmsite.org/publ.html The Public Enemy review pg. 1], filmsite.org, accessed October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous scene in the picture is referred to as the "grapefruit scene"; when Cagney is eating breakfast, his girlfriend angers him, so he cruelly shoves half of a grapefruit in her face.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk, Tim. [http://www.filmsite.org/publ2.html The Public Enemy review pg. 2], filmsite.org, accessed October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The scene became so famous that for the rest of his life when Cagney dined at a restaurant, other patrons would send his table a grapefruit.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes. pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Cagney was even more violent towards women in his 1933 gangster film ''[[Picture Snatcher]]'', where he knocks out an amorous woman he is not interested in and violently throws her into the back seat of his car.&lt;ref name="DH150"/&gt; ''Enemy'' was based in part on the Irish gangster [[Dean O'Banion]], and a scene in which Cagney kills a horse that caused the death of a friend was inspired by a similar real life event where O'Banion underling [[Louis Alterie|Louis "Two Guns" Alterie]] and others shot a horse.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes. pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The film's trailer featured no scenes from the movie; it merely contained a warning of the picture's intensity and showcased a gun being fired at the camera.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes. pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Zanuck also produced ''Enemy'', and was heavily involved in the film's production. He aimed for a movie where the characters were not just immoral, but free of morals, and devoid of conscience. When he showed the film to MGM's [[Irving Thalberg]], Thalberg remarked "that's not a motion picture. It's beyond a motion picture."&lt;ref name="Vi30"/&gt; While Wingate conceded that the film "was a story that needed to be told", other states were less convinced. Maryland and Ohio cut the grapefruit scene. All states cut a scene where Powers sleeps with a gang den mother while drunk, then slaps her when he wakes up and realizes she took advantage of him.&lt;ref name="Vi33"/&gt;

''Public Enemy'' was a massive box office success, and helped the financial fortunes of [[Warner Brothers]] which was still operating in the red at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes. pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; This embarrassed Hays who had remarked at the film's opening that "the greatest of all censors—the American public—is beginning to vote thumbs down on the "hard-boiled" realism in literature and on the stage which marked the post-war period."&lt;ref name="Vi33"/&gt;

===''Scarface''===
[[File:Muni Scarface 2.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Paul Muni]] in the trailer for ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), based on the life of [[Chicago]] gangster [[Al Capone]]. Due to battles with censors, the film was delayed for almost a year.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Bret. [http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=90484 "Scarface (1932)"], Turner Classic Movies, accessed November 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The most violent and controversial pre-Code gangster film was undoubtedly ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932).&lt;ref name="DH148"&gt;Doherty. pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]]. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19831209/REVIEWS/312090301/1023 Scarface], ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'', December 9, 1983, accessed October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vsc"&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117794664.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 Scarface], ''Variety'', December 31, 1931, accessed October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by [[Howard Hawks]] and starring Paul Muni as Tony Camonte, the film is based on the life of [[Al Capone]].&lt;ref name="DH148"/&gt; When the film begins, Camonte works for Johnny Lovo but is unhappy being a subordinate, and is attracted to Lovo's girlfriend Poppy. He has a deep love for his promiscuous sister, who he expects to remain chaste, which has often been deemed incestuous.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt; Lovo warns Camonte to leave the North Side alone as it is controlled by a rival mob. Camonte ignores this warning and begins a series of executions and extortions that result in a war with the North side gang. Camonte then takes the gang over from Lovo, at which point Lovo tries to kill him but fails. Camonte murders Lovo and Poppy becomes his girl. When Camonte finds his missing sister in a hotel room with his closest friend, the coin flipping gangster Guino Rinaldo (played by [[George Raft]]), he goes into a rage and kills Rinaldo. After he finds out that they had become married and wanted to surprise Camonte he becomes despondent. The film ends with first Camonte sister then Camonte being gunned down by police at his home.&lt;ref&gt;Hawks, Howard. ''Scarface.'' (1932), United States: [[United Artists]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of ''Scarface'' was troubled from the start. The Hays office warned [[Howard Hughes]], the film's producer, not to make the film. He ignored their pleas telling Hawks: "Screw the Hays Office. Start the picture and make it as realistic, as exciting, as grisly as possible."&lt;ref&gt;Vieira. pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt; When the film was completed in late 1931, the Hays office demanded numerous changes, including a conclusion where Camonte was captured, tried, convicted, and hung,&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743580,00.html Cinema: The New Pictures: Apr. 18, 1932], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', April 18, 1932, accessed October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and demanded the film carry the subtitle ''Shame of a Nation''.&lt;ref name="Sm68"&gt;Smith. pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes sent the picture to numerous state censorship boards, saying that he hoped to show the film was made to combat the "gangster menace".&lt;ref name="DH150"&gt;Doherty. pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to get the film past the New York State censor board (then headed by Wingate&lt;ref name="DH150"/&gt;) even after the changes, Hughes decided to release the movie in a version close to its original form.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; When other local censors refused to release the edited version, the Hays Office sent Jason Joy around to ensure them that the cycle of gangster films of this nature was coming to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Black. pg. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

''Scarface'' provoked outrage mainly due to its unprecedented violence, but also because of its shifts of tone from serious to comedic.&lt;ref name="DH150"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 149&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Kehr]], writing in the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', said that the film blends "comedy and horror in a manner that suggests Chico Marx let loose with a live machine gun."&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;Kehr, Dave. [http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/scarface/Film?oid=1150143 Scarface], ''Chicago Reader'', accessed October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In one scene, Camonte is inside a cafe while a torrent of machine gun fire from the car of a rival gang is headed his way. His bumbling assistant, following orders from Camonte, keeps trying to answer the phone instead of ducking even after the gangsters make several passes by the cafe. After the barrage is over, Camonte picks up a [[tommy gun]] one of the mobsters dropped, and exhibits child like wonder and unrestrained excitement over the new toy.&lt;ref name="DH150"/&gt; Civic leaders became furious that gangsters like Capone (who was also the blatant inspiration for ''Little Caesar''&lt;ref name="Film4"/&gt;) were being applauded in movie houses all across America.&lt;ref name="SS178"/&gt; Some of the biographical details that were used for Muni's character in ''Scarface'' were so obviously taken from Capone, and the detail so close, that it was impossible not to draw the parallels.&lt;ref name="DH148"/&gt; Capone sent several members of his gang to threaten screenwriter [[Ben Hecht]], but Hecht was able to convince them the picture was based on other gangsters. When ''Scarface'' was released however, Capone adored the film, and purchased a personal copy.&lt;ref&gt;Prince. pg. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; The film remained out of circulation, until Hughes's death in 1976. Universal then re-released the picture, but some scenes from the film's original cut are lost.&lt;ref&gt;Vieira. pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prison films==
In contrast to the crumbling social system outside their walls, the prison film portrayed a universe where the state was all powerful and orderly.&lt;ref name="DH158"&gt;Doherty. pg. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Sparked by the Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930 in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions in prisons in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name="DH158"/&gt; The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt; In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pgs. 159-60&lt;/ref&gt; In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconion system in the blazing outdoors where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors.&lt;ref name="DH158"/&gt; The prototype of the prison genre was 1930's ''The Big House''.&lt;ref&gt;Druker, Don. [http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-big-house/Film?oid=1055698 The Big House], ''Chicago Reader'', accessed October 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 1932's ''I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang'' is considered the seminal film of the chain gang genre. Although the chain gang film ''[[Hell's Highway (1932 film)|Hell's Highway]]'' had beaten ''Fugitive'' to the screen two months earlier, it exerted nowhere the influence.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstein, Hans J. [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/94754/Hell-s-Highway/overview Hell's Highway], ''All Movie'' reprinted in  ''The New York Times'', accessed October 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Big House'' [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] plays a squirmy inmate who is sentences to six years after committing vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. His cell mates are a murderer played by [[Wallace Beery]] and a forger played by [[Chester Morris]].  The picture features future staples of the prison genre such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, visitations, an escape, and the codes of prison life. The protagonist, Montgomery, ends up being a loathsome character, a coward who will sell anyone in the prison out to get an early release.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The film was banned in Ohio, the site of the deadly prison riots that inspired it.&lt;ref name="Doherty. pg. 170"&gt;Doherty. pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Numbered Men]]'', ''[[The Criminal Code]]'', ''[[Shadow of the Law]]'', ''[[Convict's Code]]'', and others, from no less than seven studios, followed.&lt;ref&gt;Black. pgs. 158–9&lt;/ref&gt; However, prison films only appealed to men, and had weak box office performances as a result.&lt;ref name="Doherty. pg. 170"/&gt; Studios also produced children's prison films which addressed the juvenile delinquency problems of America in the Depression. ''The Mayor of Hell'' for instance, featured kids killing a murderously abusive reform school overseer without retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chain gang films===

[[File:Muni Chain Ganger.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Paul Muni]] prepares to have his ankle shackles bent, via sledge hammer, by the prisoner, in the background in ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'' (1932). Based on the autobiographical memoirs of [[Robert E. Burns]], who was himself a fugitive at the time of the picture's release, the film was a powerful agent for social change.]]

Chain gang movies, like ''[[Hell's Highway (1932 film)|Hell's Highway]]'' (1932), are usually used to promote awareness about the brutal conditions that prisoners were subjected to in most Southern prisons. ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'' (1932), which is based on the true story of [[Robert. E. Burns]], is by far the most famous example of those films.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 163&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of 1931, ''[[True Detective Mysteries]]'' magazine had published Burns' work over six issues, and it was released as a book in January 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Niemi. pg. 381&lt;/ref&gt; Decorated veteran James Allen (Paul Muni) returns from World War I a changed man, and seeks an alternative to the tedious job that he left behind. He travels the country looking for construction work. His ultimate goal is to become involved in construction planning. Allen follows a hobo he met at a homeless shelter into a cafe, taking him up on his offer of a free meal. When the hobo attempts to rob the eatery, Allen is charged as an accessory, convicted of stealing a few dollars, and sentenced to ten years in a chain gang. The men are chained together and transported to a quarry to break rocks every day. Even when unchained from each other, shackles remain around their ankles at all times. Allen convinces a large black prisoner who has particularly good aim to hit the shackles on his ankles with a sledgehammer to bend them. He removes his feet from the bent shackles, and in a famous sequence, escapes through the woods while being chased by bloodhounds. On the outside he develops a new identity and becomes a respected developer in Chicago. He is blackmailed into marriage by a woman he does not love who finds out his secret. When he threatens to leave her for a young woman he has fallen in love with, she turns him in. His case becomes a [[cause célèbre]], and he agrees to turn himself in under the agreement that he will serve 90 days and then be released. He is tricked however, and not freed at the agreed upon time. This forces him to escape again, and he seeks out the young woman, telling her that they cannot be together because he will always be hunted. The films end with her asking him how he survives, and his ominous reply from the darkness; "I Steal".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mervyn LeRoy|LeRoy, Mervyn]]. ''I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang.'' (1932) United States: Warner Bros.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although based on reality, ''Chain Gang'' changes the facts slightly to appeal to Depression era audiences by making Allen's return home one to a country that is struggling economically, even though Burns returned to the roaring twenties.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The film's bleak, anti-establishment ending shocked audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 166&lt;/ref&gt; ''Laughter in Hell'', a 1933 film directed by [[Edward L. Cahn]] and starring [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]], was inspired in part by ''I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang''.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 162&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien plays a railroad engineer who kills his wife and her lover in a jealous rage, and is sent to prison. The dead man's brother ends up being the warden of the prison and torments O'Brien's character. O'Brien and several others revolt, killing the warden and escaping.&lt;ref name="tcm"&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=81001 Laughter in Hell], tcm.com, accessed October 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DH167"&gt;Doherty. pg 167&lt;/ref&gt;  The film, which is [[lost film|lost]], drew controversy for its [[lynching]] scene in which several black men were hanged. Reports vary if the blacks were hanged alongside other white men, or by themselves. The New Age (an African American weekly newspaper) film critic praised the filmmakers for being courageous enough to depict the atrocities that were occurring in some southern states.&lt;ref name="DH167"/&gt;

[[File:Júpiter y Tetis, por Dominique Ingres.jpg|thumb|[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the [[sky father]] of Roman religion and mythology]]

The [[sky]] often has important religious significance. Many religions, both [[polytheism|polytheistic]] and [[monotheism|monotheistic]], have [[deity|deities]] associated with the sky.

The daylit sky deities are typically distinct from the night-time sky (or "heaven of the stars") deities. [[Stith Thompson]]'s ''Motif-Index of Folk-Literature'' reflects this by separating the category of "Sky-god" (A210) from that of "Star-god" (A250).

Daytime-gods and Nighttime-gods may also be deities of an "[[Upper World (Greek)|upper world"]] (or "celestial world"), opposed to a "[[Underworld|netherworld]]" (or "chthonic realm") ruled by other gods (for example, Sky-gods [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]] rule the celestial realm in ancient Greece, while the chthonic realm is ruled by [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]]), or of an upper world and netherworld respectively.

Any masculine sky god is often also [[king of the gods]], taking the position of [[patriarch]] within a [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. Such king gods are collectively categorised as "[[Sky father]]" deities, with a polarity between sky and earth often being expressed by pairing a "Sky father" god with an "[[Earth mother]]" goddess (pairings of a Sky ''mother'' with an Earth ''father'' are less frequent). A main sky goddess is often the "queen" ("[[Queen of Heaven (antiquity)|of heaven]]", for example).

Gods may rule the sky as a pair (for example, [[ancient Semitic religion|ancient Semitic]] [supreme] god [[El (deity)|El]] and the sky goddess [[Asherah]] whom he was most likely paired with).&lt;ref&gt;El was identified with the storm deity [[Yahweh]] in early Hebrew religion, ultimately giving rise to [[God in Judaism|Hebrew monotheism]] by the 7th century BCE; according to the [[Hebrew Bible]] it was 7th-century Judean king [[Josiah]] who removed the statue of Asherah from the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem. See also ''[[The Hebrew Goddess]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Snuff-scarey-skullies.jpg|right|thumb|Snuff Puppet Skullies from Scarey]]
'''Snuff Puppets''' is an Australian puppet theatre company that was founded in 1992.

Originating in Canberra as part of [[Splinters Theatre of Spectacle]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realtimearts.net/article/issue50/6852&lt;/ref&gt; Snuff Puppets moved to a dusty warehouse in the industrial working class suburb of [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]] in [[Melbourne]], and are now based in the historic ''Footscray Drill Hall''. Snuff Puppets founding members were Pauline Cady and Simon Terrill and the current Artistic Director, Andy Freer.&lt;ref&gt;http://snuffpuppets.com/our-team/andy-freer/&lt;/ref&gt;

The company tour nationally and internationally with both indoor and outdoor shows. Snuff Puppets combine the elements of puppetry, live music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/classic/improv/snuffpup.htm Finalists - Snuff Puppet Band&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; visual and physical theatre. The company refers to its 'roaming acts' as 'interventions' as Snuff Puppets specialize in creating mayhem in the streets, playing with traffic and shoppers.

Subjects that are considered taboo are tackled, with 'a vulgar, irreverent, gratuitously violent and a comic sensibility'.&lt;ref name="snuff puppets dot com"&gt;[http://www.snuffpuppets.com snuff puppets dot com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Realtime Magazine wrote that Snuff Puppets have a 'commitment to pushing bad taste to its extreme'.

Snuff Puppet elements: ‘a blackly dangerous humour, an incisive political satire, shamelessly handmade visual aesthetic; populist, free, joyous conflagration of art, audience and artist.’&lt;ref name="snuff puppets dot com"/&gt;

In 2015 Snuff Puppet's promotional video for the installation 'Everybody' &lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube | id= CnbxO7P7Xnk | title= ''Snuff Puppets - Everybody - Giant Human Puppet'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; went viral, copies of the video have been reported as been viewed nearly 1 billion times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/537455/Creepiest-clip-internet-weird-mother-monster-puppet-snuff-puppets-show&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Followspot operator.jpg|thumb|right|A spotlight operator working]]
The '''Spotlight operator''' or '''Followspot Operator''', is a [[theatrical technician]] who operates a specialized [[stage lighting instrument]] known as a [[followspot]]. A followspot is any lighting instrument manually controlled by an operator during a performance. Generally a followspot will be a dedicated, large lighting instrument designed to pan, change size, beam width, and color easily by hand.

==Followspot controls==
*Choppers – Cuts or shutters the top and bottom part of the beam.
*Douser – Controls intensity.
*Iris – Controls beam size.
*Trombone – Controls focal length.
*Color Frames – Changes the color of the light. May also known as a boomerang and/or a [[color magazine (lighting)|color magazine]]. Color magazines contain the [[color gel]]s, which are counted from the rear of the follow spot forward.

'''Stomper''' the Maverick is the [[mascot]] for the [[Minnesota State Mavericks]] athletics teams of the [[Minnesota State University, Mankato]] and the associated club teams and charities. During the year, Stomper makes over 250 appearances and is at virtually all home games for University teams as well as regional and charity fund raisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minnesota State Unveils New Mascot Logo, Maverick Mascot Gets a Make-Over|url=https://www.mnsu.edu/news/read/?id=old-1097038800&amp;paper=topstories|website=MSU News Stories|publisher=Minnesota State University, Mankato|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stomper is known for helping to rally the fans and crowds at sporting events through various antics. He can be seen as part of giveaways and other competitions and is often playfully waving to children. Several events, locations and areas are named for Stomper. For example, the University works in collaboration with Mankato Transit Service to run the Stomper Express, a transit service for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transit Routes|url=https://www.mnsu.edu/parking/bus_services.html|website=University Transportation|publisher=Minnesota State University, Mankato|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The athletics teams of [[Minnesota State University, Mankato]] have changed over the years. Initially as a teacher preparatory college there was no formal mascot until the 1920s when the nickname the "peds" was used to refer to the [[Pedagogy|pedagogues]] an informal reference to teachers. In the 1950s the mascot the Indians were adopted, but this was dropped in 1976 due to the fact that Native American groups saw this as not representative of their culture. During 1977 there was a competition to come up with a new mascot. During the same time then Mankato State University was transitioning to a new athletic conference, the [[North Central Conference]]. The winning suggestion was from Professor Roy Cook, a native of Texas, who suggested the Maverick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minnesota State Athletics Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.msumavericks.com/sports/2009/10/6/GEN_1006090753.aspx|website=Minnesota State Mavericks|publisher=Minnesota State University, Mankato Athletics|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maverick is a wild powerful steer, unbranded and unyielding.

From this Stomper the Maverick, the mascot was born in the 1980s and officially given the name "Stomper" during Homecoming festivies in 1993 (officially unveiled Oct. 14, 1993). Over the years Stomper has had different designs, with the most recent redesign in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minnesota State Unveils New Mascot Logo, Maverick Mascot Gets a Make-Over|url=https://www.mnsu.edu/news/read/?id=old-1097038800&amp;paper=topstories|website=MSU News Stories|publisher=Minnesota State University, Mankato|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Miracle Woman''''' is a 1931 American [[pre-Code]] [[Christian film]] directed by [[Frank Capra]] and starring [[Barbara Stanwyck]], [[David Manners]], and [[Sam Hardy (actor)|Sam Hardy]]. Based on the play ''Bless You Sister'' by [[John Meehan (screenwriter)|John Meehan]] and [[Robert Riskin]], the film is about a preacher's daughter who becomes disillusioned by the mistreatment of her dying father by his church. Having grown cynical about religion, she teams up with a con man and performs fake miracles for profit. The love and trust of a blind man, however, restores her faith in God and her fellow man. ''The Miracle Woman'' was the second of five film collaborations between Capra with Stanwyck. Produced and distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]], the film was reportedly inspired by the life of [[Aimee Semple McPherson]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Miracle Woman (1931)|work=The New York Times|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/102467/The-Miracle-Woman/overview|accessdate=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Florence Fallon is outraged when church elders, in order to make way for a younger preacher, fire her minister father after his many years of selfless service. Following her father's death, she tells the congregation what she thinks of their ingratitude and hypocrisy. Her bitter, impassioned speech impresses Bob Hornsby, who convinces her to become a phony [[evangelism|evangelist]] so they can squeeze donations out of gullible believers. Promoted as Sister Fallon, Florence then travels about the country with Bob, who manages her "Temple of Happiness". Soon she attracts a devoted national following, but the religious sham comes tumbling down once she meets and falls in love with John Carson, a blind war veteran.  When Florence is blackmailed by Bob, she tells John of her charade.  John then puts a plan in motion to expose Hornsby and the organization

''The Sun's Darling'' was licensed for performance by Sir [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Henry Herbert]], the [[Master of the Revels]], on 3 March [[1624 in literature|1624]]. It was probably composed not long before; nineteenth-century speculations that the text was an old play of Dekker's, revised by Ford, have fallen out of favor.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The original text may have been revised c. 1638–39; material in the early portion of Act V reflects the dominant political situation at that time. [[Cyrus Hoy]] has suggested that the play was revised and revived at that time, as a response to [[Thomas Nabbes]]'s ''Microcosmus'' ([[1636 in literature|1636]]; published [[1637 in literature|1637]]).&lt;ref&gt;Waith, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Several attempts have been made by individual commentators to identify the shares of the two collaborators, though no general agreement on the question has been reached.

The first edition was a [[book size|quarto]] printed by T. Bell for the bookseller [[Andrew Pennycuicke]]. The 1656 title page states that the play was "often presented" by [[Queen Henrietta's Men]] at the [[Cockpit Theatre]]; but it also makes the questionable claim that the play was "often presented" at [[Whitehall Palace]] — a claim dropped from the title page of the second quarto of [[1657 in literature|1657]]. If the work had a Court performance, it would in all likelihood have been once or at most twice, not "often."

Pennycuicke dedicated Q1 to Lady Newton, wife of [[Sir Henry Newton]]. Q2 was dedicated to [[Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton]];&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wriothesley was the son of the famous 3rd Earl, [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|Henry Wriothesley]], Shakespeare's patron and the dedicatee of ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' and ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]''. Thomas Wriothesley succeeded his father in 1624.&lt;/ref&gt; that dedication is signed by Pennycuicke and the actor [[Theophilus Bird]]. Both the 1656 and 1657 editions include prefatory verses by [[John Tatham]]. The title pages describe the work as a "moral masque" — an accurate description, in that the drama combines the traits and characteristics of the traditional [[morality play]] with those of the 17th-century masque.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Featuring standard masque-style personifications, like Youth, Health, Delight, Time, Detraction, Fortune, etc., and rich in songs, dances, and May-Day games, the play has some obvious crowd appeal to explain its popularity in its own era. The protagonist is Raybright, who is the child and "darling" of the Sun. To treat his melancholy, he is given a year to experience the earthly pleasures of the four seasons. He falls, however, under the deceptive influences of Humor (in the Elizabethan sense) and Folly, and his search for satisfaction is unfulfilled. In the end the Sun warns Raybright that he must resist Folly and Humor to attain harmony.

Some critics have praised the "vitality and beauty" of some of the lyrics in the play; others have judged the work more harshly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8842">'''Tour promoters'''   (also known as '''concert promoters''' or talent buyers) are the individuals or companies responsible for organizing a live [[concert tour]] or special event performance. The tour promoter makes an offer of employment to a particular artist, usually through the artist’s [[talent agent|agent]] or [[music manager]]. The promoter and agent then negotiate the live performance [[contract]]. The majority of live performance contracts are drawn up using the [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) standard contract format known as the ''AFM Performance Agreement''.

==Services==
Included among the tour promoter’s various job responsibilities are: (1) obtaining [[Music venue|venue]], [[concert hall]], [[theater]], [[nightclub]] or [[arena]] bookings; (2) pricing the event or tour; and (3) providing air, sea or land [[transportation]] (optional). However the promoter must have upfront cash and or [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] financing to pay for advertising the tours of the artists. Such advertising costs, usually referred to as a Media or Promotional Kit, commonly include [[television]] and radio [[advertisement]]s, [[poster]]s, [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] adverts, [[online marketing]] and so on.

==Promoter compensation==
There are no figures available concerning how much an average concert promoter makes annually. Like most [[music industry]] professions, compensation depends on the level of success possessed by the artist the promoter works with, location, and what a given market will bear. The promoter assumes all the financial risk in putting on a show, so compensation also depends on how successful the promoter is at negotiating with [[Distributor (business)|vendors]] and creating sold-out shows. Additionally, in-depth knowledge of their operating market and audience characteristics are critical success factors for any tour promoter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm MusicBizAdvice Q&amp;A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115173626/http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm |date=2009-01-15 }} January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry overview==
The rise of large corporation mega-promoters over the past ten years has made it much more difficult for aspiring tour promoters to break into the industry. [[Live Nation]] (previously known as [[Clear Channel Entertainment]]) is the number one concert promoter in the world according to figures released by ''Pollstar Magazine'' in 2006. The [[Beverly Hills, California]]-based corporation accounted for about $1.3 billion in concert [[box-office]] sales during 2005, according to [[Billboard magazine]]'s tracking. [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] ([[AEG Live]]) was ranked second with $417 million, followed by [[House of Blues]] (HOB Entertainment) at number three with $245 million. On July 5, 2006, Live Nation purchased HOB Entertainment for $350 million, further expanding their market share in the live-music business.&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/business/media/06music.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Big Promoter of Concerts to Acquire House of Blues], ''[[New York Times]]''. July 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

While average ticket prices jumped to roughly $57 in 2005, the number of tickets sold for the 100 biggest tours dipped 3.5%, to 36.3 million.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; Some fans have complained to government officials, particularly after they found tickets to the same concerts or sporting events available - sometimes at many times the face value - on secondary sellers like Stubhub.com and TicketsNow minutes after the public sale began. After hearing from some would-be ticket buyers, the [[Missouri]] [[attorney general]] announced the state was suing three ticket resellers on charges they violated state consumer protection laws. That same day, the [[Arkansas]] attorney general said he was seeking documents from five resellers. And the attorney general’s office in [[Pennsylvania]] is also looking into the ticket sale business after receiving several hundred complaints over the recent sale of tickets for a [[Hannah Montana]] concert in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/business/06money.html?scp=9&amp;sq=concert&amp;st=nyt In the Race to Buy Concert Tickets, Fans Keep Losing], ''[[New York Times]]''. October 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live Nation and Ticketmaster===
On December 21, 2007, Live Nation announced it would acquire the software and services to ramp up its ticket-selling operation, potentially positioning the company to compete directly with its longtime contractor, [[Ticketmaster]].&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/21/business/21music.html?scp=1&amp;sq=concert&amp;st=nyt Top Concert Promoter Sets Up a Challenge to Ticketmaster] ''[[New York Times]]''. December 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Live Nation, the largest concert promoter, and Ticketmaster Entertainment, the No. 1 ticket seller, announced merger on February 10, 2009.  Then on January 25, 2010 the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] approved the merger with terms that include that Ticketmaster sell Paciolan, its ticketing and software services unit, to Comcast's sports and entertainment firm or "another buyer suitable to the department."

Ticketmaster must also license its software to [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG), the company’s largest customer. With a copy of the Ticketmaster software, AEG will be able to market an attractive ticketing system to venues, according to the DOJ; under the settlement terms, both companies will be able to compete head-to-head with Ticketmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reagan|first=Gillian|title=Ticketmaster And Live Nation Get Approval As One Giant Music Monster |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ticketmaster-and-livenation-get-approval-as-one-giant-music-ticket-monster-2010-1#ixzz1PenCQbOG|work=Business Insider|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College concert market===
Colleges can provide "dedicated fans, an excellent testing ground, eager workers, [and] loyal fans."  The college market provides a network of new potential fans that artists, labels, agents, and managers could focus on for promotion.  The major record labels have departments dedicated to college promotion and hire students as representatives for all the artists on these labels.  [[Sony Music Entertainment]] has a college marketing department, which promotes records released by Sony and by their independent label affiliates.  Other music marketing companies such as Cornerstone Promotion focus on college marketing.  Cornerstone Promotion hires representatives from colleges all around the country to implement small scale marketing campaigns on their campuses.  
Artists began breaking into the college market in the 1990s.  [[Billboard Magazine]] published articles dating back to the early-mid nineties urging artists and agents to take advantage of the college market.  Artists such as [[Dave Matthews Band]] and R.E.M. played college shows to increase their presence in the college market in the nineties.  Billboard Magazine has emphasized the extent to which college concerts can help an artist in multiple articles.

==Education==
There are numerous degree programs and academic courses focusing on concert promotion and venue management. Some of these are full degree programs, while others are certificates offered for post-graduate studies. For example, [[New York University]] offers a Certificate in Meeting, Conference, and Event Management, and a Certificate in Sports Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scps.nyu.edu/departments/department.jsp?deptId=21 New York University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010063335/http://www.scps.nyu.edu/departments/department.jsp?deptId=21 |date=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3492">'''''Toy Biz v. United States''''' was a 2003 decision in the [[United States Court of International Trade]] that determined that for purposes of [[tariffs]], [[Toy Biz]]'s [[action figures]] were [[toy|toys]], not [[doll|dolls]], because they represented "nonhuman creatures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Toy Biz v. United States |court=United States Court of International Trade |date=January 3, 2003 |url=http://www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/slip-op%2003-2.pdf |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision effectively halved the tariff rate, from 12 percent tax to 6.8 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Iglesias |first=Matthew |title=How Trade Policy Cost The X-Men Their Humanity |url=https://slate.com/business/2011/12/are-mutants-human.html |access-date=November 22, 2018 |work=Slate.com |date=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Harmonized Tariff Schedule for the United States|Harmonized Tariff Schedule]] in [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]] distinguished between two types of action figures for determining tariffs: dolls, which are defined to include human figures, and toys, which include "nonhuman creatures". Because duties on dolls were higher than those on toys, [[Marvel Comics]] [[subsidiary]] Toy Biz argued before the [[U.S. Court of International Trade]], that their action figures (including the [[X-Men]] and [[Fantastic Four]]) represented "nonhuman creatures" and were subject to the lower tariff rates for toys instead of the higher ones for dolls. On January 3, 2003, after examining more than 60 action figures, Judge [[Judith Barzilay]] ruled in their favor, granting Toy Biz reimbursement for import taxes on previous toys.

==Reaction==
Because a common theme in Marvel Comics had been the struggle for [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] like the X-Men to prove their humanity, the case shocked numerous fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No Time for Mutants |work=USC Annenberg Online Journalism Review |date=January 22, 2003 |url=http://www.ojr.org/ojr/spike/1043234172.php |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvel responded to these concerns by claiming "our heroes are living, breathing human beings{{spaced en dash}}but humans who have extraordinary abilities ... A decision that the X-Men figures indeed do have 'nonhuman' characteristics further proves our characters have special, out-of-this world powers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=King |first=Neal |title=Fans Howl in Protest as Judge Decides X-Men Aren't Human |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 20, 2003 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1043013622300562504 |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Harmonized Tariff Schedule for the United States|Harmonized Tariff Schedule]] was amended to eliminate the distinction between dolls and other toys, which are now in the same category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Daily |first=James |title=Are the X-Men Human?

'''''Two Fat Ladies''''' is a [[BBC Two|BBC2]] television cooking programme starring [[Clarissa Dickson Wright]] and [[Jennifer Paterson]]. It originally ran for four series, from 9 October 1996 to 28 September 1999, being produced by [[Optomen|Optomen Television]] for the [[BBC]]. Since then, the show has been repeated frequently on the [[Food Network]] and [[Cooking Channel]] in the U.S. and on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] in Australia. In the UK, the show has been transmitted many times on the satellite channel [[Good Food]].

==Programme==
The show centred on [[Clarissa Dickson Wright]] and [[Jennifer Paterson]], travelling the United Kingdom for most of the episodes, except for one episode in Ireland and a Christmas special in Jamaica, on a [[Triumph Thunderbird]] motorcycle driven by Paterson. It sported the registration N88 TFL (the British [[List of British bingo nicknames|bingo call]] for number 88 is "Two Fat Ladies") and had a [[Watsonian Squire|Watsonian]] Jubilee&lt;ref name=Optomen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.optomen.com/international/programme/568/two-fat-ladies|website=Optomen International|accessdate=26 October 2015|title=Two Fat Ladies|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026193831/http://www.optomen.com/international/programme/568/two-fat-ladies|archivedate=26 October 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; GP-700 "doublewide" [[sidecar]] where Dickson Wright rode. They travelled to various destinations, such as an army garrison and an all-girls school, where they prepared large meals, often with unusual ingredients.

Paterson's uncle, Anthony Bartlett, was [[Gentiluomo of the Archbishop of Westminster|Gentiluomo]] to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Archbishop of Westminster]], and so some episodes were videotaped at [[Westminster Cathedral]] and an Irish convent. While cooking at Westminster Cathedral, Paterson cooked an original dish, ''Peaches Cardinal Hume''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://completerecipes.com/83623.htm |title=Healthy Recipes |publisher=Completerecipes.com |date= |accessdate=22 March 2014 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same episode, Dickson Wright demonstrated a [[bubble and squeak]] recipe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recipesource.com/ethnic/europe/british/00/rec0039.html |title=BUBBLE AND SQUEAK (Two Fat Ladies) |publisher=RecipeSource |date= |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which used two ounces of lard, which she insisted is the only fat besides beef dripping that could ever get hot enough to produce the recipe as it should be produced. Similarly, her recipe for buttered [[spatchcock]] saw chickens covered with a thick layer of butter, bread and more butter on top of the bread. Recipes such as this led to criticism by some who considered them to be a bad influence on the British diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/6179497/Clarissa-Dickson-Wright-They-dont-call-me-Krakatoa-for-nothing.html |title=Clarissa Dickson Wright: 'They don't call me Krakatoa for nothing' |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optomen Television had this to say, as if in reply to their critics: "The Ladies are cooks not chefs - they reject the pretensions and elaborations of [[haute cuisine]] and are aggressively unfashionable, delighting in such ingredients as clotted cream, lard and fatty meats."&lt;ref name=Optomen /&gt;

==Theme song ==
Paterson and Dickson Wright sang their own theme song written by composer Pete Baikie, and Paterson often burst into song during the show, once introducing apple pan dowdy with a verse from the song "[[Shoo-Fly Pie and Apple Pan Dowdy]]" (erroneously attributing the song to [[The Andrews Sisters]]). They revelled in cooking at grand locations, as at [[Lennoxlove House]] near Edinburgh.

==Health issues==
Both Paterson and Dickson Wright affected unconcern with fat or calories. Paterson also smoked heavily and, at one point, took the opportunity to go out for a cigarette while a dish cooked in the oven. Most episodes ended with her smoking a cigarette and consuming an alcoholic beverage. Several times references were made to the fact that Dickson Wright, a recovering alcoholic, no longer drank any alcoholic beverages.

==Deaths==
Paterson died of lung cancer on 10 August 1999, one month after diagnosis. The day before she died, she asked Dickson Wright to bring her a tin of caviar but when Dickson Wright arrived at the hospital, Paterson had already died. Dickson Wright said that after Paterson's funeral, she ate the caviar as a tribute to her friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/416231.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Two Fat Ladies star dies |publisher=BBC News |date=10 August 1999 |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickson Wright died of pneumonia in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 15 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26611394 |title=BBC News - TV cook Clarissa Dickson Wright dies |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*The show was parodied on ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' as "One Fat Lady" with the late [[John Morgan (comedian)|John Morgan]] as Dickson Wright making a fatty and sugary treat consisting of goose fat, lard, a packet of Sugar Twin and blackstrap molasses.
*A February 1999 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' aired a sketch that parodied ''Two Fat Ladies''. [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Darrell Hammond]] played them, as they cooked dishes sautéed in pure ''[[buttermilk]]'' (which is, in reality, quite low in fat, &lt;1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/98/98m.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Brendan Fraser: 02/13/99 |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date=13 February 1999 |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Season 2, Episode 14 of ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' Rory and Lorelai are watching repeats of ''Two Fat Ladies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=TV.com|title=Gilmore Girls Episode Guides|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/gilmore-girls/episodes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cookbooks==
"The Two Fat Ladies" produced four cookbooks which accompanied each of the four television series. In order: ''Two Fat Ladies: Gastronomic Adventures (with Motorbike and Sidecar)'', ''The Two Fat Ladies Ride Again'', ''The Two Fat Ladies: Full Throttle'' and ''Two Fat Ladies Obsessions''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_11?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=two%20fat%20ladies&amp;sprefix=two+fat+lad%2Caps%2C349&lt;/ref&gt;

==DVD release==
''The Two Fat Ladies'' DVD set was released in the United States in July 2008. The [[Acorn Media UK]] set includes a 40-minute BBC tribute to Paterson, biographies of the stars and "six yummo recipes" in a booklet. It contains all 24 episodes across four discs. The show had previously been released in Britain as a [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 2]] DVD set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dvdspindoctor.typepad.com/dvd_spin_doctor/2008/07/two-fat-ladies.html |title=New DVDs: 'Two Fat Ladies,' in full - DVD Spin Doctor |publisher=Dvdspindoctor.typepad.com |date=26 July 2008 |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tổ tôm''' is a draw-and-discard [[card game]] played in Vietnam, usually by men.&lt;ref&gt;Mark W. McLeod, Thi Dieu Nguyen ''Culture and Customs of Vietnam'' 2001- Page 164 "called to tom, or "shrimps' nest" (a modernized version is known in the West as mah-jongg) were extremely popular .."&lt;/ref&gt; The game is often played at [[festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Phương Quỳnh Đỗ ''Traditional festivals in Vietnam'' 1995 "A number of games and cultural items are performed during the Festival days, at the yard of the communal house: cabaret song performances, human chess (human beings play the role of chess men), the "to tom" card game involving watch-towers, a flower dance (after the dance, flowers are thrown out and people try to snatch them as symbols of good luck).."&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the Chinese game of [[Khanhoo]].

The game uses a type of [[Chinese playing cards#Money-suited cards|Chinese money-suited pack]] consisting of 120 cards. The head and foot of the card gives the rank and suit in [[Chinese characters]]. During [[French Indochina|French colonial rule]], the [[Marseilles]] firm Camoin redesigned the deck to depict people wearing traditional Japanese costumes from the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollett, Andrea. [http://a_pollett.tripod.com/cards50.htm Vietnam] at Andy's Playing Cards. Retrieved 22 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three suits: [[Cash (Chinese coin)|Cash]] (文, ''Văn''), Strings of Cash (索, ''Sách''), and [[Myriad]]s of Strings (萬, ''Vạn''). Each suit is divided into ten ranks with the highest cards being the Half Cash, Zero String, and Old Man respectively. There are four copies of each card unlike its four-suited kin, ''Bài bất''.

There are five players who each have to draw and discard to form a hand of twenty-one cards. Like Khanhoo, [[Meld (cards)|melds]] are divided into certain types: 
*three or four identical cards
*a [[Run (cards)|run]] of three cards in the same suit
*three cards of the same rank but each from a different suit

In addition there are special melds:
*1, 2, 3 Cash (not really special but traditionally listed as one)
*9 Cash, 1 String, 1 Myriad
*8 Cash, 2 Strings, 2 Myriad
*7 Cash, 3 Strings, 3 Myriad
*Zero String, 9 Strings, 9 Myriad
*Zero String, 9 Strings, Old man
*Half Cash, 8 Strings, 9 Myriad

Yuki Kato was the daughter of a [[samurai]] [[swordsmith]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan O-Yuki: Geisha of the Gilded Age. ''Morgan O-Yuki: Geisha of the Gilded Age''. by Gail M. Burns, July 2006. "Born in Kyoto, Yuki Kato (1881-1963) ...the daughter of a Samuri sword-maker, an honorable profession, but one that was on the wane in .."&lt;/ref&gt; As a Gion geisha, she was known as "Kokyū no Sekka" (胡弓の雪香) for her "sublime" performances on the traditional [[kokyū]] instrument.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joho-kyoto.or.jp/~wazaden/english/hito/morgan_e.html&lt;/ref&gt; George Morgan arrived in Japan in 1902 and saw Yuki performing at Miyako Odori geisha theater.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Longstreet - We all went to Paris: Americans in the City of Light, 1776-1971 - 1972 Page 228 "This true Madame Butterfly story began in 1902 when the American, George Morgan — a close relative of the great womanizer and multimillionaire, Pierpont Morgan — landed in Japan. He was fleeing a busted romance in New York City, and ..."&lt;/ref&gt; He courted Yuki for two years and paid her debt to the [[Okiya]] house for $20,000.00.&lt;ref&gt;[[Time (magazine)]] vol.81 1963 p63 "Yuki Kato Morgan, 81, widow of wealthy George Morgan, a beautiful Japanese Geisha girl who withstood the pleas of young Morgan (a nephew of J. P. Sr.) for nearly two years, at last in 1903, unlike Madame Butterfly, married the man and .."&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported to the Morgan family in the US that the young lady he married came from an excellent family. However, according to some accounts of their reception in the US, she was rejected and ostracized by the Morgans.&lt;ref&gt;The World Almanac and Encyclopedia - 1916  Page 619 "Josephine Adams Perry. 1 Sarah Speaker Morgan Mil. 9.
