'''1880 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[American football]]==
'''College championship'''
* [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|College football national championship]] – [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton Tigers]] and [[Yale Bulldogs football|Yale Bulldogs]] (shared)
'''Events'''
* [[Walter Camp]] becomes an influential figure at the Massasoit House conventions where rules are debated and changed. His 1878 proposal to reduce the teams from fifteen players to eleven is passed in 1880, the effect being to open up the game and emphasise speed over strength. Camp's most famous rule proposal, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, is also passed in 1880.

==[[Association football]]==
'''England'''
* [[1880 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] – [[Clapham Rovers F.C.|Clapham Rovers]] 1–0 [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford University]] at [[The Oval]]
* A dispute develops between [[Bolton Wanderers]] and the [[The Football Association|FA]] about [[professionalism]], a heated topic in football through the 1880s which will directly or indirectly involve many other clubs besides Bolton.  The FA espouses the so–called "Corinthian Spirit" and there are constant arguments about broken–time payments, out–of–pocket expenses and what amounts to actual wages.  Despite its convictions, the FA has no objection to professional clubs playing in the [[FA Cup]] and this may be a tacit acknowledgement that the growth of professionalism is inevitable.  There are close links at this time between football and cricket, which has employed professionals since the 17th century.  Part of the problem is that many of the amateurs see football as "fun", but cricket is taken very seriously and the professional cricketer is considered necessary.  Bolton Wanderers, formed in 1874 as a church team, has already become an ambitious club and is turning professional to attract talent from Scotland.  Its neighbour [[Blackburn Rovers]] also turns professional in 1880.
* [[Manchester City]] founded as West Gorton FC (east Manchester) by members of St Mark's Church cricket team.
'''Ireland'''
* Establishment of the [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA) in [[Belfast]] as the world's fourth oldest football association. Until the formation of the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI) in 1921, the IFA administers football throughout Ireland although participation in the 19th century is mainly centred on the Belfast area. The IFA now governs football in Northern Ireland only and is not to be confused with the FAI which governs football in the Republic of Ireland.
'''Scotland'''
* [[1880 Scottish Cup Final|Scottish Cup final]] – [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] 3–0 Thornliebank at [[Hampden Park (1873–83)|Hampden Park]]

==[[Baseball]]==
'''National championship'''
* [[National League]] champions – [[Chicago White Stockings (1870–89)|Chicago White Stockings]]
'''Events'''
* The latest National Association, a professional rival of the National League, goes out of business after its fourth season, contested by only three to four clubs.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 30 May — after four years of inactivity, [[Joe Goss]] finally defends his Heavyweight Championship of America title against [[Paddy Ryan]] at Collier's Station, West Virginia.  Ryan wins after 87 rounds.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/ryan-p.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Paddy Ryan].  Retrieved on 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John L. Sullivan]] is now the main contender for Ryan's title and announces that he will fight anyone in America, with or without gloves, for $500.&lt;ref name="JLS"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/sully.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – John L Sullivan].  Retrieved on 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Most runs – [[Billy Barnes (cricketer)|Billy Barnes]] 1,220 @ 28.37 (HS 143)
* Most wickets – [[Alfred Shaw]] took 186 @ 8.54 (BB 8–31) and his Notts colleague [[Fred Morley]] took 184 @ 12.26 (BB 8–36)

'''Ali Sami Yen Stadium''' ({{lang-tr|Ali Sami Yen Stadyumu}}) was the home of the football club [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray S.K.]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], from 1964 to 2010. It is named after the founder of the club, [[Ali Sami Yen]]. The stadium had a capacity of 23,477 (all-seater) and was situated in the [[Mecidiyeköy]] quarter of the [[Şişli]] district, at the center of the [[Europe]]an side of the city.

==History==

===Galatasaray needs a new stadium===
Football was first played in Istanbul by some British players in a field known as [[Papazın Çayırı]] (Priest’s Field) in the area that is now the site of [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]]'s [[Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium]]. With the opening of the [[Taksim Stadı]] in 1921, which was located inside the courtyard of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era [[Taksim Military Barracks|Taksim Artillery Barracks]] (''Taksim Topçu Kışlası'') built by Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] in the 1840s; the surrounding walls of which were transformed into tribunes. This new stadium that became the new football headquarters.
In the urban development of 1939, the military barracks in which the Taksim Stadium was located was demolished in 1940. The stadium was thus lost. 
In this period, Fenerbahçe bought the land encompassing Papazın Çayırı and built the Fenerbahçe Stadium, while the Beşiktaş Club moved into the [[Şeref Stadı]], located in the area where today’s Çırağan Palace stands. 
It was Galatasaray that experienced the biggest problem with the use of a stadium in that period.
The first steps to overcome this problem were taken in the initial years of the 1930s. The first initiative to acquire a plot of land for Galatasaray was in 1933, when the then president of the club [[Ali Haydar Barşal]] showed an interest in a mulberry orchard in [[Mecidiyeköy]].

===From Taksim to Mecidiyeköy===
In the period 1933-35, discussions held with the government resulted in the allocation of a plot of land outside of the city limits in Mecidiye Köyü (Mecidiye Village) for a stadium to be built for Galatasaray. Excavations for the construction began in 1936. The President of the Turkish Sports Organization at the time, Adnan Menderes, provided financial assistance for the project. The efforts were left in the excavation stage however.
In 1940, the matter of the stadium came up again under the presidency of [[Tevfik Ali Çınar]]. 
The same plot of land was leased to Galatasaray for a term of 30 years at a symbolical yearly rental fee of 1 lira.
Galatasaray thus acquired the right to the use of the land. In leasing the land, Galatasaray committed to building a modern stadium as well as a bicycle velodrome. The construction could not start, however, due to limited funds and the general atmosphere of the war years. In 1943, Osman Dardağan led an initiative to build a modest stadium that would answer the immediate need.

===Mecidiyeköy Stadi===
In the atmosphere of war, only a small open tribune was allowed in the stadium, which was set on a field of earth and inaugurated under the presidency of [[Muslihittin Peykoğlu]] in 1945. 
Its distance from the city center in those days, however, its inaccessibility by public transportation, and the rough winds that characterized the district were factors that contributed to a long period in which the stadium lay idle and football games never took place.
When the [[İnönü Stadium]] in the center of the city was opened in that period, Galatasaray abandoned the stadium building project in Mecidiyeköy, putting the project aside before fruition. In 1955, 30 more years were added to the right of utilization agreement, which at the time had 22 years to go, extending the terms until 2007.
When the Club failed to undertake the building of the Stadium, the project was taken on by the Physical Education General Directorate. The construction started in 1959. In 1961, during the presidency of Refik Selimoğlu, a new agreement was signed with the Physical Education General Directorate whereby the utilization rights of the newly completed stadium were explicitly given to Galatasaray.

===Ali Sami Yen Stadi / expansion===
Ali Sami Yen Stadi was inaugurated on December 20, 1964, with a friendly game between Turkey and Bulgaria. Unfortunately, tragedy struck during the opening match: in one of the stands many people fell onto the first floor, which caused numerous injuries, but luckily none of them were fatal. 
Spotlights were added to the stadium in 1965, and night games began to be played. Despite this, however, not many night games were played.
At the beginning of the 1970s, the stadium was abandoned for another period during which the İnönü Stadium began to be used again.
In the 70s, the stadium was mostly used by Galatasaray for training sessions. In those years, it remained in a squalid state of neglect.
In 1981, grass was planted on the field and the stadium was opened again.
The lighting system was renewed in 1993, after which night games began to be played once more.
In the same year, the system of combined tickets was initiated in Turkey at Ali Sami Yen Stadı.
Also in the same year, the stadium was furnished with seats to replace the old benches.
Standing room at the stadium was thus reduced from a 35,000 seating capacity to 22,000.

===New stadium project===
1997, The Galatasaray administration assigned a Canadian architectural firm the job of designing Turkey’s first multi-function, modern stadium to be built in place of Ali Sami Yen Stadı, which was planned to be torn down.
The new stadium project was launched in 1998 and it attracted wide interest. During the promotion of the modern loge system, the entire loge section was sold at a symbolical fee.
The search began for funds to finance the construction of the new stadium. Because of the club’s difficult financial situation at the time, the needed funds could not be found.
Over the period of 2001-2002, a revision was made in the project with an eye toward reducing the amount needed for financing but this time, although costs were brought down, the economic crisis of 2001 stood in the way of overcoming the financial issue.
In the 2003 -2004 season, the old project came up again but was abandoned in favor of building a new and modern stadium. Again, financing needs could not be met.
Because Mecidiyeköy was now a part of the city center, state authorities objected to the expansion of the stadium in this district. A new piece of land was suggested to Galatasaray as an alternative.
The search for financing for the new stadium that would be built on this new plot continued over the period 2004-2007.

===Renovation and new ''Eski Açık'' stand===
After a general renovation that took place in the 2004-2005 season, the club returned to Ali Sami Yen.
Following the earthquake of 1999, the old Open Tribune was demolished and replaced in the 2005-2006 season for reasons of safety.
In 2007, discussions with state authorities on the construction of a new Galatasaray stadium in Aslantepe yielded positive results. It was decided that the new stadium to be built within two years on the new plot would be transferred to Galatasaray in return for the club's handing over the property on which Ali Sami Yen stood.

===The final end===
At the end of 2007, ten years after the initial announcement of the project in 1997, the groundbreaking for the new stadium was carried out (December 13, 2007) at a ceremony attended by state officials. The old project was put aside and a new project was contracted to Mete Arat in Germany.
In 2008, Galatasaray’s last year at Ali Sami Yen, the Lower Closed Tribune was renovated in line with UEFA standards.
The construction of the new stadium, the Türk Telekom Arena, gained speed when the contracting company was changed in 2009.
It was announced that the official opening of the new stadium would take place on January 15, 2010.
The new stadium was inaugurated on January 15, 2011.

==''Welcome to Hell'' / The atmosphere==
In the past, games were played in front of more than 35,000 spectators in this stadium, which is nicknamed "Hell" by Galatasaray's supporters because of the sea of red and yellow, intimidating atmosphere and the enthusiastic support of the fans who often make mass use of torches, smoke, drums, flags and giant posters to create visual grandeur and apply psychological pressure on visiting teams. Ali Sami Yen is important for Galatasaray because it saw many victories against renowned European football clubs, such as [[FC Barcelona]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Manchester United]], [[Juventus]], [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and many others.

==Location==
The stadium was located in [[Şişli|Mecidiyeköy]], one of the most crowded quarters of central [[Istanbul]], surrounded by dense urban development.
The new home ground of Galatasaray is the newly built [[Türk Telekom Arena]] in the Seyrantepe quarter near [[Maslak]] financial district in [[Şişli]]. The new stadium, which was opened 15 January 2011, has a capacity of 52,652 seats, making it the largest private stadium owned by a club in Turkey.

==Access==
Access to Ali Sami Yen was very easy, as the stadium was not far from popular tourist locations such as [[Taksim Square]]. There are bus stops for several lines of the Metropolitan Municipality's bus network near where the stadium was situated. The subway station's name is "Şişli/Mecidiyeköy".

==Games and tickets==
A portion of the stadium, covering around 7,000 to 8,000 seats, were sold annually in the form of season tickets. Average number of fans per game was around 19,000, while the stadium had a capacity of 23,000.

==Stands==
[[File:Galatasaray-Konyaspor game.jpg|thumb|300px|The famous ''Kapali'' stand with the ''GALATASARAY'' sign and logo]]
The stadium was made up of two identical lateral stands which were covered by a roof: the ''Numaralı'' (Numbered) stand and the ''Kapalı'' (Covered) stand.
The two other stands, behind the goal gates, were the ''Yeni Açık'' (New Open), with 2 tiers, and the ''Eski Açık'' (Old Open), with the electronic scoreboard.
The best atmosphere in the stadium was in the ''Kapalı'' (Covered) stand, where the most fanatical fans congregated. It had a capacity of 5,528. 
For more comfort, the ''Numaralı'' (Numbered) stand was the best, but this was also the most expensive one. The capacity was 4,351. 
The ''Yeni Açık'' (New Open) stand had a capacity of 7,869. 
The stadium's most modern section was the rebuilt ''Eski Açık'' (Old Open) stand with a capacity of 6,597 seats.

With a [[seating capacity]] of 4,400, Bulldog Stadium utilizes a design that is usually reserved for larger stadiums, ensuring excellent sight lines and maximum comfort for spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bears Back To Work Vs Bryant|first=Dale|last=Duff|url=http://929theticket.com/bears-back-to-work-vs-bryant/|work=[[WEZQ]]|location=Bangor|date=September 13, 2014|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 3,200-seat permanent bleacher comprises the backdrop for the home side of the field, while 1,200 additional seats are available on the visitor's side.  Three hundred seats in the stadium are equipped with backs and arm rests. The stadium also has its own athletic training center, office space and public rest rooms.

The Bulldog Stadium press box contains booths for both home and visiting coaches as well as work space for game personnel and visiting media. A number of telephone lines are connected to the press box, allowing members of the media to file stories from the site and track out-of-town scores. The press box also has a fax machine and Internet access available to members of the media. CBulldog Stadium's playing surface was laser-graded, and special turf was installed in time for the 1999 varsity football season.

In 2007, the Bulldogs hosted their first ever appearance in the [[NCAA Division II National Football Championship]] versus [[West Chester University of Pennsylvania|West Chester]]. In the 2008-2009 school year Bryant University Athletics became a Division I sports program. They belong to the North East Conference (NEC) for most sports, as well as the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) for Swimming and Diving.

In addition to serving as the home of Bryant's football team, Bulldog Stadium occasionally hosts the school's men's and women's lacrosse and men's and women's soccer teams. These teams regularly use their designated game fields that include a turf complex and variety of well manicured grass playing surfaces with smaller stands. Bulldog Stadium has been known to host some of Rhode Island's high school state championship games in recent years as well.

[[File:Towriepetrosphere.jpg|thumb|The exceptionally elaborately decorated ball from [[Towie, Aberdeenshire|Towie]] in Aberdeenshire, dated from 3200&amp;ndash;2500 BC&lt;ref&gt;[http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-100-033-206-C&amp;PHPSESSID=0m851am1612gh5fi5bfltvd5g5&amp;scache=25cl220v88&amp;searchdb=scran&amp;PHPSESSID=0m851am1612gh5fi5bfltvd5g5 "Carved stone ball"]. National Museums of Scotland. Retrieved 22 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Carved stone balls''' are [[petrosphere]]s dated from the late [[Neolithic]] to possibly as late as the [[Iron Age]] mainly found in [[Scotland]], but also elsewhere in Britain and Ireland. They are usually round and rarely oval, and of fairly uniform size at around 2.75 inches or 7&amp;nbsp;cm across, with 3 to 160 protruding knobs on the surface. They range from having no ornamentation (apart from the knobs) to extensive and highly varied engraved patterns.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;Marshall, D. N. (1976/77). "Carved Stone Balls". ''Proc Soc Antiq Scot'', 108, Pp. 4–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide range of theories have been produced to explain their use or significance, without any one gaining very wide acceptance.

They are not to be confused with the much larger smooth round [[stone spheres of Costa Rica]].

==Age and distribution==
Carved stone balls are up to 5200 years old, coming from the late Neolithic to at least the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name="ashmolean.org"&gt;http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/britarch/highlights/stone-balls.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all have been found in north-east Scotland, the majority in [[Aberdeenshire]], the fertile land lying to the east of the [[Grampian Mountains]]. A similar distribution to that of [[Pict]]ish symbols led to the early suggestion that carved stone balls are Pictish artefacts.&lt;ref name="Marshall55"&gt;Marshall, D.N. (1976/77). Carved Stone Balls. Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 108, P. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The core distribution also reflects that of the [[Recumbent stone circles]]. As objects they are very easy to transport and a few have been found on [[Iona]], [[Skye]], [[Harris, Scotland|Harris]], [[Uist]], [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Hawick]], [[Wigtownshire]] and fifteen from [[Orkney]]. Outside Scotland examples have been found in [[Ireland]] at [[Ballymena]], and in England at [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[Cumbria]], [[Lowick, Northumberland|Lowick]] and [[Bridlington]]. The larger (90mm diameter) balls are all from Aberdeenshire, bar one from [[Newburgh, Fife|Newburgh in Fife]].

By the late 1970s a total of 387 had been recorded.&lt;ref name="Marshall55"/&gt; Of these, by far the greatest concentration (169) was found in Aberdeenshire. By 1983 the number had risen to 411.&lt;ref name="Marshall83"&gt;Marshall, D. N. (1983). "Further notes on Carved Stone Balls". ''Proc Soc Antiq Scot'', 113, pp. 628-646.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2015 a total of over 425 balls were recorded.&lt;ref name="ashmolean.org"/&gt; A collection of over 30 carved balls from Scotland, Ireland and northern England is in the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=ball+neolithic British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological context==
Many of the balls have not had their discovery site recorded and most are found as a result of agricultural activity. Five were found at [[Skara Brae]] village and one at the [[Dunadd]] hillfort. The distribution of the balls is similar to that of mace-heads, which were both weapons and prestige objects used in ceremonial situations.&lt;ref name="Marshall63"&gt;Marshall, D.N. (1976/77). Carved Stone Balls. Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 108, P. 62 – 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of context is likely to distort the interpretation. Random finds are only likely to have been picked up and entered a collection if they were aesthetically appealing. Damaged and plain balls were less likely to find a market than decorated examples so some more decorated examples might be fraudulent.

In 2013, archaeologists discovered a carved stone ball at [[Ness of Brodgar]], a rare find of such an object ''in situ'' in "a modern archaeological context".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/archaeology/nessofbrodgar/2013/08/dig-diary-wednesday-august-7-2013/ "Dig Diary — Wednesday, August 7, 2013"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325001901/http://www.orkneyjar.com/archaeology/nessofbrodgar/2013/08/dig-diary-wednesday-august-7-2013/# |date=25 March 2014 }}. Orkneyjar. Retrieved 10 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical characteristics==

=== Materials ===
[[File:Room 51, British MuseumDSCF6621.jpg|thumb|left|Another example]]
Many are said to be made of "[[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]]", but this is a general term for all varieties of dark, greenish igneous rocks, including [[diorites]], [[serpentinite]], and altered [[basalt]]s.  Forty-three are sandstone, including Old Red Sandstone, 26 greenstone and 12 [[quartzite]]. Nine were [[serpentinite]] and these had been carved. Some were made of [[gabbro]], a difficult material to carve. Round and oval natural shaped sandstones are sometimes found. Examples made from Hornblende [[gneiss]] and granitic gneiss were noted, both very difficult stone to work. Granitic rocks were also used and the famous Towie example may be serpentinised [[picrite]]. The highly ornamented examples were mainly made of sandstone or serpentine.&lt;ref name="Marshall54"&gt;Marshall, D.N. (1976/77). Carved Stone Balls. Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 108, P. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number have not as yet been fully inspected or tested to ascertain their composition.

===Experimental archaeology===
Using authentic manufacturing techniques (pecking and grinding), full replicas have been made by Andrew T. Young, a researcher at the University of Exeter. It was shown that they could be made using prehistoric technology with no recourse to the use of metal tools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eprofile.exeter.ac.uk/andrewyoung/?section=2 University of Exter, The Ground Stone Tools of Britain and Ireland: an Experimental Approach von Andrew T. Young], retrieved 30. August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size, shape and knobs===
Of the 387 carved stone balls known in 1976 (now about 425), 375 are about 70&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, but twelve are known with diameters of 90 to 114&amp;nbsp;mm. Only 7 are oval. They are therefore about the size of tennis balls or oranges.

Nearly half have 6 knobs, 3 have 3 knobs, 43 have 4 knobs, 3 have 5 knobs, 18 have 7 knobs, 9 have 8 knobs, 3 have 9 knobs, 52 have between 10 and 55 knobs and finally 14 have between 70 and 160 knobs.

===Ornamentation===
[[File:Human Prehistory in the Kelvingrove carved stone ball Aberdeenshire.JPG|thumb|A Carved stone ball with low-profile knobs]]
The decoration used falls into three categories, those with spirals, those with concentric circles and those with patterns of straight incised lines and hatchings. More than one design is used on the same ball and the standard of artwork varies from the extremely crude to the highly expert which only an exceptionally skilled craftsman could have produced. Some balls have designs on the interspaces between the knobs which must be significant in the context of the speculated use of these artefacts.
Twenty-six of the six-knobbed balls are decorated. The Orkney examples are unusual, being either all ornamented or otherwise unusual in appearance, such as the lack, bar one example, of the frequently found six-knobbed type. Metal may have been used to work some of the designs.

The Towie ball has some design similarities with the carvings on the [[Folkton Drums]]. These were found in a [[tumulus]] in England and are made of [[chalk]] with elaborate carvings, amongst which are distinct [[oculi]] or eyes.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;Powell, T. G. E. (1966). ''Prehistoric Art''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-20046-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentric carved lines on stone balls appear to be stylised oculi. This ball also has a roughly triangular arrangement of three dots in an interspace between the knobs.  This appears to be identical to the arrangement of dots found on the Parkhill silver chain terminal ring, found near Aberdeen, a Pictish artefact. It is possible that the dots represent a name, as some of the Pictish symbols at least are thought to represent personal names.&lt;ref name="Cummins"&gt;Cummins, W. A. (1999). The Picts and their Symbols. Sutton Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7509-2207-9}}. P. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spirals or plastic ornament which is similar to Grooved Ware is found on the Aberdeenshire examples, this being a type of late Neolithic pottery not known in the north-east but common in Orkney and Fife. The [[New Grange]] carvings in Ireland show strong similarities to those found on some balls. A continuous spiral is found on one and elements of chevrons, zig-zags and concentric triangles are also found, stimulating comparisons with [[petrosomatoglyph]] symbolism. Mostly the different knobs have different or sometimes no ornamentation. A 'golf-ball' variety of ornamentation is found on a few balls. The carving does not appear to have any practical purpose in general, however it has been suggested that one type, with very distinct knobs, was used for processing copper ores (see under 'Function'). Some of the bold triangles and criss-cross incisions seem to be more Iron Age in character than Neolithic or Bronze Age.&lt;ref name="Marshall62b"&gt;Marshall, D. N. (1976/77). Carved Stone Balls. Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 108, P. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
[[File:Human Prehistory in the Kelvingrove carved stone ball Turriff.JPG|thumb|left|Glasgow example]]

Some of the balls have grooves or interspaces between the knobs into which leather could be tied so as to make a device such as a [[bolas]]. Their use as weapons was suggested by many researchers but in recent years this idea has fallen from favour.

One suggestion saw the balls as movable poises on a primitive weighing machine, following the logic of the remarkable uniformity in size shown by a good number of these carefully made objects. However, it has been shown that their weights vary so considerably that mathematically they could not be considered part of a system of weight measurement.

'Sink stones' found in Denmark and Ireland have some slight similarities, these artefacts being used in conjunction with fishing nets.&lt;ref name="Evans10"&gt;Evans, Sir John (1897). The Ancient Stone Implements, weapons and ornaments of Great Britain. Pub. Longmans, Green &amp; Co. 2nd Edition. P. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

The possible use of the balls as [[oracle]]s has been suggested. The way in which the ball came to rest could be interpreted as a message from the gods or an answer to a question. The lack of balls found in graves may indicate that they were not considered to belong to individuals.

An alternative or supplementary use could have been as the 'right to speak' where discussions are controlled by the requirement for the speaker to hold the carved stone ball or if not, then keep his or her peace and listen to the views of others. The balls are of a size that fits comfortably in one hand.

Another possible use for the stones would be in the working of hides.  Into the 20th century leatherworkers polished leather, parchment, and hides, by tying the skins to a frame using a ball at each corner of the hide then rubbing down material being worked with stones.  The corners of the hides were wrapped around the balls which allowed the bindings to hold fast without slipping off.  In more modern times, the balls were often made from scraps of the material being worked and the leather was cut away from the balls when the polishing was finished.  This caused the balls to grow in size until the process had to be started over by replacing the oversized balls with scraps and beginning a new ball.

Balls of plain sandstone with the facets from shaping still clearly visible were found at [[Traprain Law]] in [[East Lothian]]. A significant number have already been found here and are known from other southern Scottish Iron Age sites. They may date from the fourth to third centuries BC. These balls are not ornamented and do not have knobs.&lt;ref name="Rees and Hunter"&gt;Rees, Thomas &amp; Hunter, Fraser (2000). Archaeological excavation of a medieval structure and an assemblage of prehistoric artefacts from the summit of Traprain Law, East Lothian. 1996 - 7. PSAS 130, P. 413 - 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Megalith construction aid===
[[File:Human Prehistory in the Kelvingrove carved stone ball Alford.JPG|thumb|Another in Glasgow]]
A theory on the movement of 'monument stones' has been put forward as a result of an observed correlation between standing stone circles in Aberdeenshire, Scotland and a concentration of carved stone balls, and it is suggested that these [[petrosphere]]s may have been used to help transport the big stones by functioning like [[ball bearing]]s.

Many of the late Neolithic stone balls have diameters differing by only a millimetre. The discovery of this led to the suggestion that they might have been meant to be used together. By plotting the find sites on a map it can be demonstrated that often these petrospheres were located in the vicinity of Neolithic recumbent stone circles. Models using small wooden balls placed in a groove in parallel longitudinal pieces of wood 'sleepers' with a carrying board above have shown such megalith transport to be practical in some situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Discovering the Secrets of Stonehenge|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101130010931.htm|accessdate=8 July 2011|newspaper=Science Daily|date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platonic solids==
The carved stone balls have been taken as evidence of knowledge of the five [[Platonic solids]] a millennium before Plato described them. Indeed, some of them exhibit the symmetries of Platonic solids, but the extent of this and how much it depends on mathematical understanding is disputed, as configurations resembling the solids can naturally arise when placing knobs around a sphere.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} There does not appear to be much special attention given to the Platonic solid arrangements over less symmetrical arrangements of knobs over the balls, and some of the five solids do not appear.{{sfn|Lloyd|2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hart|first=George|title=Neolithic Carved Stone Polyhedra|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/neolithic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:donkey basketball.jpg|thumb|Photograph of a donkey basketball player.]]

'''Donkey basketball''' is a variation on the standard game of [[basketball]], played on a standard basketball court, but in which the players ride [[donkey]]s. A donkey basketball game is usually staged as a one-shot fundraising event, typically in public schools. Commercial farms provide donkeys and equipment, splitting the proceeds with the hiring party. Donkey basketball has been practiced in the United States since the 1930s. 

Donkey basketball has been targeted by animal rights activists who claim that the sport is [[cruelty to animals|cruel to animals]],&lt;ref name="WMHS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.whsv.com/home/headlines/86474532.html |title=PETA Calls for Valley School to Cancel Donkey Basketball Game |last=Pulley |first=Mary |date=2010-03-04 |publisher=WHSV |accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Modern Farmer"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://modernfarmer.com/2014/12/dark-side-donkey-basketball/ |title=The Dark Side of Donkey Basketball |last=Roth |first=Anna |date=2014-12-09 |publisher= |accessdate=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for reasons such as the inexperience of participants with handling the donkeys.

'''Ghāzī Amānullāh International Cricket Stadium, Jalalabad''' ({{lang-ps|د غازي امان الله نړيوال کريکټ لوبغالی}}) is an international standard [[cricket]] stadium in [[Afghanistan]]. It is located in the heart of [[Ghazi Amanullah Town]], a new suburb of [[Jalalabad]] in [[Nangarhar Province]].&lt;ref name="PAN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2011/07/25/international-cricket-stadium-inaugurated-nangarhar-video|title=International cricket stadium inaugurated in Nangarhar (Video)|date=25 July 2011|publisher=[[Pajhwok Afghan News]] |language=Pashto |accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on the stadium began in March 2010 when the foundation stone was laid by [[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Minister of Finance]] and president of the [[Afghanistan Cricket Board]], [[Omar Zakhilwal]].&lt;ref name="AFCS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiancricket.org/index.php/news/march-2010/1641|title=Afghanistan's First Cricket Stadium|last=Momand|first=Hiral|date=19 March 2010|publisher=[[Asian Cricket Council]]|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was developed on 30 acres of land donated by the developer constructing Ghazi Amanullah Town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/sport/cricket/afghanistan-to-build-international-cricket-stadium-1.702242 Afghanistan to build international cricket stadium] October 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase of construction, which took a year to complete, cost [[US dollar|$]]1.8 million, and included the completion of the basic stadium.&lt;ref name="AFCS"/&gt; A [[cricket pavilion|pavilion]], accommodation for players and administrative buildings were constructed later.&lt;ref name="AFCS"/&gt;

The stadium, which has a capacity of 14,000, was completed before the [[Afghanistan national cricket team|national team]] and [[Afghanistan Under-19 cricket team|under-19 team]] left for [[Afghan cricket team in Canada in 2011|Canada]] and the [[2011 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup Qualifier|Under-19 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Ireland]] respectively. The two sides inaugurated the stadium in a [[Twenty20]] match.&lt;ref name="AFCS"/&gt;

It is hoped that the stadium will be able to attract international teams to play Afghanistan, which is now a Full Member of the [[International Cricket Council]].

In several [[team sport]]s, [[match]]es are played in two halves. '''Half-time''' (also written '''halftime''' or '''half time''') is the name given to the interval between the two halves of the match. Typically, after half-time teams swap ends of the field of play, in order to reduce any advantage that may be gained from wind or a slope to the playing surface, for example.

While it exists mainly to allow competitors to rest briefly and recover from the play of the first half, half-time also serves a number of other purposes. It also serves as an [[intermission]] for spectators, and it often features [[halftime show|entertainment]], such as [[cheerleading|cheerleading performances]], [[tifo]]s, performances by school [[marching band]]s (particularly in high school and [[collegiate sports]] in North America), or concerts featuring popular music acts (particularly in major events, such as the [[Super Bowl halftime shows|Super Bowl]]). On games that are broadcast on television and radio, it also provides broadcasters with an opportunity to give a recap of the first half of the game, air highlights of other games in progress, air [[Advertising|commercials and other advertisements]], provide analysis on the game, or air game-related festivities (such as an aforementioned half-time performance). In the NFL (National Football League), halftime is usually around 12 minutes, although for major events like the Super Bowl it may last much longer to allow for more activities like musical performances.

==History==
The origin of changing ends at half-time lies in the early [[English public school football games]]. One early use of a ''fixed'' half-time, and it is suggested the origin of the practice, was to allow for two football teams each used to a different set of rules to play half of the game by familiar rules, and half by the opposition rules. This was practised notably between followers of [[Eton College|Eton]]-rules football (closer to modern association football) and [[Rugby School|Rugby]]-rules football (closer to modern rugby [[Rugby union]]). This use of half-time was unnecessary after the standardisation of football rules in 1863 (see [[Laws of the Game (association football)#History and development|Laws of the Game]]) but is still used for the now-rare contests between teams playing different codes of football. Changing ends at half-time (if no goals had been scored) was part of the following schools' codes:  Brighton, Eton, Rossall, Sheffield, and Winchester. Other schools changed every time that side scored (Cheltenham, FA, Harrow, Marlborough, Rugby, Shrewsbury, Uppingham schools)&lt;ref&gt;''Football, The First Hundred Years: The Untold Story''.  Adrian Harvey.  Routledge, Abingdon, 2005 p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1863 [[Cambridge Rules]] state: "In a match when half the time agreed upon has elapsed, the side shall change goals when the ball is next out of play".

==Overview==
One benefit of half-time in a field game is to allow teams to swap their positions on the field in order that the effects of the natural conditions such as sunlight and wind direction are experienced fairly by both teams. In some sports this is achieved without the need for half-time: for example, in [[cricket]] fielding positions of players are rotated after a set passage of play.  In other sports no such provision is necessary, for example in [[baseball]], where playing positions do not change and both teams occupy the same locations on the field of play, though there is frequent rotation of players in the ordinary course of play.

Half-time for spectators offers the opportunity to visit the [[toilet]], get some [[food]] or [[drink]], or just [[exercise]] [[cramp]]ed [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]], without the fear of missing any of the action. A [[half-time show]] may be put on for the spectators to keep their attention, most famously in the case of the [[American football]] [[Super Bowl]]. As many spectators at the ground may be otherwise occupied using stadium facilities it might be inferred that the scale and spectacle of half-time entertainment is more directly related to the size of the potential television audience.

In many sports that are [[television|televised]], half-time offers the opportunity to advertise, a valuable source of [[revenue]] for [[television]] [[companies]]. In addition, it allows analysis of the game so far by pundits; controversial incidents or exceptional play may be highlighted at this time. It also allows viewers to catch up with any action that they may have missed. Half-time has spawned one of the most enduring [[clichés]] to describe football: that "it's a game of two halves."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/sport-on-tv-its-a-game-of-two-halves-and-this-is-how-the-other-half-lived-765630.html It's a Game of Two Halves] ''[[Independent (newspaper)|Independent]]'', 16 December 2007, accessed 19 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Original Hockey Hall of Fame''', formerly the '''International Hockey Hall of Fame (IHHOF)''' is a museum dedicated to the history of [[ice hockey]] in Canada, located in [[Kingston, Ontario]], Canada. The IHHOF was intended to be the original Hall of Fame for hockey, but events led to the establishment of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0004032 The Canadian Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The IHHOF was renamed the Original Hockey Hall of Fame in 2013, and now focuses on the history of the sport, and emphasis on the role people from Kingston had in its development.

==History==
[[Image:International Hockey Hall of Fame.jpg|right|thumb|International Hockey Hall of Fame former home (1965-2012).]] 
The International Hockey Hall of Fame was founded on September 10, 1943, and incorporated as a non-profit [[charitable organization]] by the [[National Hockey League]] and the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]]. It was established through the efforts of [[James T. Sutherland]], a former President of the CAHA and OHA, who sought to establish it in Kingston because he believed that the city was the birthplace of ice hockey.&lt;ref name="p1"&gt;''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the NHL and CAHA reached an agreement that a Hall of Fame would be established in Kingston.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;  The first players were inducted on April 30, 1945, although the IHHOF still did not have a permanent home.&lt;ref name="torstar-45"&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Hockey Hall of Fame Receives Names of First Nine Immortals |date=May 1, 1945 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingston lost its most influential advocate as permanent site of the Hockey Hall of Fame when Sutherland died in 1955.&lt;ref name="p25"&gt;''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; By 1958, the IHHOF organizers had still not raised sufficient funds to construct a permanent building in Kingston. [[Clarence Campbell]], then President of the NHL, grew tired of waiting for the construction to begin and withdrew the NHL's support,&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/gi20300.shtml|title=The History of the Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=2007-12-26|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195820/http://www.hhof.com/html/gi20300.shtml|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently reaching an agreement with the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] to establish a new Hall of Fame building in Toronto.

Despite this major setback, the Board of Directors of the International Hockey Hall of Fame moved forward. In 1962, a grant was awarded by the City of Kingston for the construction of a new building. In 1965 the International Hockey Hall of Fame moved into their new building on the Memorial Centre grounds in Kingston. In 1992, the IHHOF added new exhibits from the International Ice Hockey Federation. The IIHF exhibits were located at the IHHOF from 1992 through 1997, before being relocated to Toronto, in 1998. The hall is now located at the Invista Centre, and reopened in spring 2016, with new exhibits and multimedia presentations, including a film, ''The Cradle of Hockey'', narrated by [[Don Cherry]].

==Exhibits==
[[File:The Original Hockey Hall of Fame.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Original Hockey Hall of Fame, second floor of the Invista Centre in Kingston, Ontario.]]
The museum had two floors at their original home at 277 York Street. The first had exhibits about [[Bobby Orr]], [[Don Cherry]], the [[Original Six]], [[Wayne Gretzky]] and others. The second floor had a display of the Hall of Fame's inductees, plus exhibits about Kingston and area professional hockey players, the [[World Hockey Association]], and the evolution of ice skates and hockey sticks. Artifacts included jerseys worn by [[Gordie Howe]], [[Rocket Richard]] and others, skates and sticks from the 1800s and the championship banner of the 1914 [[Toronto Blueshirts]]. Outside of the building was an oversized square "puck".

==Inductees==
{{main|List of members of the Original Hockey Hall of Fame}}

The Hockey Hall of Fame inducted nine builders and 32 players, but only two since 1952 and none since 1966. The inducted members were all included as inductees to the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Historic Hockey Series==
Each February since 1969 the Hall of Fame presents its annual Historic Hockey Series. The series is both a competition and demonstration of the first organized hockey game played on the [[Kingston Harbour]] in 1886 between [[Queen's University]] and the [[Royal Military College of Canada]]. The original style [[hockey stick|sticks]] and uniforms, as well as the original rules of that era, are used including a square [[hockey puck|puck]], seven players per side and with no forward passing.  Queen’s University and the Royal Military College of Canada compete along with the 2nd Regiment from the [[Royal Canadian Horse Artillery]] from [[Petawawa]] who represent the garrison soldiers stationed in Kingston in the 1880s in a round-robin tournament. Since 2006, the series has been held on the outdoor rink at Kingston’s downtown Market Square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihhof.com/specialEvents.htm Historic Hockey Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830225857/http://www.ihhof.com/specialEvents.htm |date=2006-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.febfestkingston.com/classic.html Historic Hockey Series &amp; Limestone Classic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615082155/http://febfestkingston.com/classic.html |date=2006-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pakistan Cricket Board''' ( [[Urdu]] '''پاکستان کرکٹ بورڈ''') controls and organises all tours and matches undertaken by the [[Pakistan national cricket team]].

Following the establishment of Pakistan as an independent [[dominion]] of the [[British Empire]] in 1947, professional and amateur cricket commenced in the same year, seeing as local infrastructure had already been established when the country was part of the [[British Indian Empire]]. Cricket matches were arranged informally until 1948, when a Board of Control was formally instituted. Pakistan was admitted to the [[imperial Cricket Conference]] in July 1952, and has since been a full member, playing Test cricket. The team's first Test series took place in India between October and December 1952.

The PCB also runs its own cricket league which is named as the [[Pakistan Super League]] (PSL). PSL is regarded as one of the world's largest franchise cricket tournament, with its matches played in [[Pakistan]] and [[United Arab Emirates]].

== Inaugural Board of Control ==
The Pakistan Cricket Board was inaugurated on 1 May 1949 as the Board of Control for Cricket in Pakistan (BCCP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152363.html |title=Some dates in Pakistan cricket history |website=Cricinfo |access-date=2017-12-01}}May 1, 1949: Board of Control for Cricket in Pakistan formed.&lt;/ref&gt; The first meeting, held in the committee rooms of Lahore Gymkhana, saw HE The Nawab of Mamdot made president and chairman, with Justice [[Alvin Robert Cornelius|A. R. Cornelius]] as one of three vice-Presidents. The following year Cornelius became chairman of the working committee, until he relinquished his connection with the board in early 1953.

The working chairman was always one of the three vice-presidents. In April 1957 [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] imposed three more new vice-presidents (himself being one of them). Then between December 1958 and September 1969 the post of vice-president disappeared.

==Committees==
The response to turmoil within the board has on four occasions been to suspend the rules and appoint an ad hoc committee. The first ad hoc committee was appointed in September 1960 and did not disband until May 1963 having created a new constitution. The President of Pakistan would now nominate the board president who would in turn nominate the other members of the Executive Committee to sit for a period of three years. Representatives of the four provincial cricket associations and Government departments formed the Executive Committee.
The BCCP was re-organised in the 1970s and was headed by former cricketers, professional administrators and trustees, who were often businessmen. In November 1976 players' demands for increased salaries reached a crisis and the Pakistan Sports Board took over running the B.C.C.P.'s affairs. Long-serving president, the formidable Kardar, was in the thick of the dispute. The revolt against Kardar forced him to resign in May 1977 and led to a new Ad Hoc Committee replacing the Board Council in 1978 running Pakistan cricket and again changing the constitution. Provincial Cricket Associations were eliminated and divisional and city CAs became members, giving most of the influence to the city Cricket Association of Lahore and Karachi.

The Board now governed a network of teams sponsored by corporations and banks, city associations and clubs. There is no province-based official team type organisation of domestic cricket in Pakistan and [[Lahore]] and [[Karachi]] cities are the two top tiers of all cricket, including reservoirs of fresh talent.

Pakistan cricket was involved by dissension and controversies over the national team's poor performance during the tour of India and a public uproar forced the end of the Ad Hoc Committee. The chairman and team captain Asif Iqbal had to step down. Air Marshal Nur Khan now became chairman and he saw the banks and other organisations increase their participation on the Board Council in the face of protests from the zonal organisations.

A third ad hoc committee under Javed Burki took charge of BCCP affairs in January 1994 and made a new constitution including giving a new name, the Pakistan Cricket Board (P.C.B.) It introduced a chairman and chief executive.

After taking heavy criticism on the grounds of corruption and match fixing, the Board was taken over by a fourth Ad Hoc Committee formed on 17 July 1999 which remains in place despite undertakings from Musharraf to bring it to an end. The Pakistan Cricket Board re-emerged by taking the initiative to sponsor the hugely successful 2004 tour of Pakistan by their rivals [[India cricket team|India]]. The Pakistan Cricket Board has competed and has associated itself with the [[Twenty20 cricket]] form and has also proven popular and hopes to similarly revive popular interest in domestic games. However, Pakistan's early exit from the 2007 World Cup cast a shadow and later [[Dr. Nasim Ashraf]]'s resigned at the end of 2008.

[[Ejaz Butt]] was named the PCB Chairman in October 2008. Zaka Ashraf took over from Butt in October 2011.

On 28 May 2013, Zaka Ashraf was suspended as PCB Chairman by [[Islamabad High Court]] due to a dubious election. The newly sworn in Government of [[Nawaz Sharif]] named [[Najam Sethi]] as acting PCB Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/644507.html Najam takes charge as acting chairman]&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October 2013, the governing council of the Pakistan Cricket Board was dissolved by the Prime Minister of Pakistan, [[Nawaz Sharif]], and an interim five man management committee was named consisting of acting chairman [[Najam Sethi]]‚ [[Shahryar Khan]], two former players ([[Zaheer Abbas]] and [[Haroon Rasheed]], and former team manager Naveed Cheema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/679671.html|title=PCB's governing board dissolved|publisher=[[ESPN]]|work=cricinfo|date=15 October 2013|first=Umar |last=Farooq|accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2014, Zaka Ashraf was reinstated as PCB Chairman. The PML-N Government was unhappy with the reinstatement (since Ashraf was a [[Pakistan People's Party|PPP]] appointee), and this led to Ashraf's sacking. In February, PCB Governing Board was dissolved and an eight-member management committee (comprising Shakil Sheikh, Shaharyar Khan, Zaheer Abbas, Iqbal Qasim, Naveed Akram Cheema, Yusaf Naseem Khokar and Faridullah Khan, the secretary IPC). Najam Sethi was elected as chairman by the management committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-28499-Sethi-in-Zaka-out-as-PCB-governing-body-dissolved Zaka ousted, Sethi in]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major Tournaments===
The major domestic competitions are [[Quaid-e-Azam Trophy]], inaugurated in 1953–1954, Patron's Trophy now [[President’s Trophy Grade-I]], [[National T20 Cup]], [[Pakistan Super League]], [[National One-day Championship]] and [[Haier Super 8 Twenty20 Cup]].

A '''round shot''' (or '''solid shot''', or a '''cannonball''', or simply '''ball''') is a solid [[projectile]] without explosive charge, fired from a [[cannon]]. As the name implies, a round shot is [[sphere|spherical]]; its diameter is slightly less than the [[Caliber|bore]] of the gun from which it is fired.

The cast iron cannonball was introduced by French artillery engineers after 1450 where it had the capacity to reduce traditional English castle wall fortifications to rubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Once Within Borders: Territories of Power, Wealth, and Belonging since 1500 |last=Maier |first=Charles S. |publisher=Harvard University Press  |year=2016 |isbn= 978-0674059788}}&lt;/ref&gt; French armories would cast a tubular cannon body in a single piece and cannonballs took the shape of a sphere initially made from stone material. Advances in gunpowder manufacturing soon led the replacement of stone cannonballs with cast iron ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Midnight Ride, Industrial Dawn: Paul Revere and the Growth of American Enterprise  |last=Martello  |first=Robert  |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0801897580 |pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Round shot was made in early times from dressed stone, referred to as '''gunstone''' (Middle English gunneston, from gonne, gunne gun + stoon, ston stone), but by the 17th century, from iron. It was used as the most accurate projectile that could be fired by a [[smoothbore]] [[cannon]], used to batter the wooden hulls of opposing ships, [[fortification]]s, or fixed emplacements, and as a long-range anti-personnel weapon. However, masonry stone forts designed during the [[early modern period]] (known as [[star fort]]s) were almost impervious to the effects of roundshot.

[[Grapeshot]] and round shot were some of the early projectiles used in [[smoothbores]].

In land battles, round shot would often plough through many ranks of troops, causing multiple casualties. Unlike the fake gunpowder explosions representing roundshot in movies, real roundshot was more like a bouncing bowling ball, which would not stop after the initial impact, but continue and tear through anything in its path. It could bounce when it hit the ground, striking men at each bounce. The casualties from round shot were extremely gory; when fired directly into an advancing column, a cannonball was capable of passing straight through up to forty men. Even when most of its kinetic energy is expended, a round shot still has enough momentum to knock men over and cause gruesome injury.

When attacking wooden ships or land structures that would be damaged by fire, the cannonball would be heated to red hot. This was called a "hot shot". (On the shot called "the single deadliest cannon shot in American history," see [[Negro Fort]].)

Round shot has the disadvantage of not being tightly fitted into the bore (to do so would cause jamming). This causes the shot to "rattle" down the gun barrel and leave the barrel at an angle unless [[wadding]] or a discarding [[sabot]] is used. This difference in shot and bore diameter is called "windage."

Round shot has been totally replaced by modern [[Shell (projectile)|shells]]. Round shot is used in historical recreations and historical replica weapons.

In the 1860s, some round shots were equipped with winglets to benefit from the [[rifling]] of cannons. Such round shot would benefit from [[gyroscopic]] stability, thereby improving their trajectory, until the advent of the [[ogival]] [[Shell (projectile)|shell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Musée de la Marine]], Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stand up paddle surfing''' and '''stand up paddle boarding''' ('''SUP''') is an offshoot of [[surfing]] that originated in [[Hawaii]]. Unlike traditional surfing where the rider sits until a wave comes, stand up paddle boarders stand on their boards and use a paddle to propel themselves through the water. The sport was documented in a 2013 report that identified it as the outdoor sporting activity with the most first-time participants in the United States that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outdoorindustry.org/research/participation.php?action=detail&amp;research_id=193|title=Research - Outdoor Participation -  Outdoor Recreation Participation Report 2013 - Outdoor Industry Association|work=outdoorindustry.org|accessdate=26 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219220029/http://outdoorindustry.org/research/participation.php?action=detail&amp;research_id=193|archivedate=19 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations include flat water paddling for outdoor recreation, fitness, or sightseeing, racing on lakes, large rivers and canals, surfing on ocean [[Water waves|waves]], paddling in river rapids (whitewater SUP), [[Paddle board yoga]] and even fishing.

Stand up paddlers wear a variety of wet suits and other clothing, depending on water and air temperature since most of their time is spent standing on the board.

A related, traditional sport, [[paddleboarding]], is done kneeling on a board and paddling with the hands, similar to a [[butterfly stroke|butterfly swimming stroke]]. The term “kooks" is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to stand up paddle surfing.

Historian and writer Steve West claimed that the contemporary notion of stand up paddle boarding, if attributed to the Waikiki Beach Boys of [[Oahu]] during the 1960s, considers that outrigger canoeing should be recognised as the direct link between the idea of standing on a board and propelling it with a canoe paddle, since the individual SUP skills (board riding and paddling) already existed, used by people who had traditionally grown up learning them.

==History==
Standup paddleboarding (SUP), the act of propelling oneself on a floating platform with the help of a paddle or pole, traces back to thousands of years ago and across many continents, but its current form and popularity originated in Hawaii in the 1900s. Records of earlier forms of SUP have been found as early as 1,000 B.C. (i.e. 3,000 years ago) and its iterations span over various regions such as Peru, Israel, Italy, China, and beyond. By contrast, the modern form of stand up paddle boarding, where a surfboard-like vessel is used, has a much clearer heritage, dating back to the 1900s and emerging from a collection of loosely related activities by a few very specific characters, such as Duke Kahanamoku and Dave Kalama. Once it reached California in the early 2000s, stand up paddling formed four epicenters, each with its own fountainhead: Rick Thomas (San Diego), Ron House (Dana Point/San Clemente), Laird Hamilton (Malibu) and Bob Pearson (Santa Cruz). From there, the sport gained exponential popularity and California served as the catalyst for worldwide adoption. By 2005, SUP, which had till then been almost entirely a surfing discipline, began to diversify into racing, touring, rivers, yoga, and fishing. Its surfing heritage coupled with its various disciplines made the sport attractive and accessible to everyone all over the world, paving the way for its global growth and enthusiastic adoption.

By the early 2000s, Archie Kalepa and the Hobie Dream Team gave the world a hint that stand-up paddleboarding had a potential far grander than waves. Kalepa began unofficially participating in cross-channel races between the islands of Hawaii, making him one of the forefathers of downwind stand up paddle racing. Meanwhile, in California, three exceptional athletes (Chuck Patterson, Colin McPhillips, and Byron Kurt) joined forces to represent the newly formed Hobie SUP Race Team. These three would show up at local prone paddleboard races, which were just beginning to have SUP divisions, and put on a show of not only performance but also product R&amp;D. Each would carefully pull his board in and out of board bags, trying to keep their edge in product development on the nascent race scene. Sensing and expanding on that flatwater movement, Ernie Brassard (together with Rick Thomas, Bob Pearson, Blane Chambers and a few others) organized the world’s first inland SUP event and race, hosted at King’s Beach on the north shore of Lake Tahoe, California. It was dubbed “Ta-hoe Nalu” and still runs to this day. That event back in 2007 was arguably the world’s first stand up paddle specific event. Since then, the market has evolved to include paddle boards meant specifically for flat water.

SUP originated in Africa where it was common practice for individuals to stand on their canoes and use their paddle to propel themselves forwards. This method was used by warriors in an attempt to conduct stealth attacks. {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The contemporary form of the sport originated in the 16th century where Hawaiian surfers would surf on boards of up to 5 meters in length. These surfers used a paddle to operate boards that were otherwise unwieldy.

SUP continued in [[Tel Aviv]] in the twentieth century where lifeguards stood on wide boards to ensure a clear view of possible swimmers in distress. The lifeguards used a paddle to propel them through the water quickly to rescue swimmers.

In the 1940s Waikiki surf instructors [[Duke Kahanamoku]] and Leroy and Bobby AhChoy began SUP as a way to stand on their boards during incoming swells, known as Beach Board surfing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theinertia.com/surf/tracing-the-colorful-history-of-stand-up-paddling/|title=Tracing the Colorful History of Stand-Up Paddling|work=The Inertia|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s SUP was taught at Hawaiian surf schools as an alternative way to surf when there was little swell. This practice became increasingly popular so surf instructor Brian Keaulana decided to add ‘’Beach Boy Surfing’’ to the world-recognized ‘’Buffalo Big Board Contest’’ in 2003. The response to this new category was overwhelming, with many recognized surfers choosing to partake.

SUP races became common; in 2012 [[Kai Lenny]] won the season's finals of the first Standup World Series championship races.

The first magazine devoted to the sport, ''Standup Journal'', was founded in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://standupjournal.com/about-us/|title=Standup Journal: About Us|work=Standup Journal|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SUP Touring===
In 2007 the concept of paddle boarding on flat-water began to take serious shape and a year later the first touring boards started to hit the market.  This style of board differed from traditional surfing style SUP’s in that it includes a displacement hull.  The discplacement hull allows the board to glide and track similar to a canoe or kayak.  Many other features soon came out on touring boards including deck rigging to carry gear.  The fast design with more glide is an attractive option for those who plan to keep their adventures inland. Tour Paddle Boarding has become a way for individuals to seek adventure, serenity, personal achievement and a deeper connection with nature.

===SUP Fishing===
The ultimate emancipation of SUP came back to its roots when SUP fishing boards came into production. Among the first was the Lane family down in San Diego, later a few people off Cabo San Lucas, but it wasn’t until it reached Florida that SUP fishing became a certifiable chapter of SUP history. Corey and Magdalena Cooper, from Destin, Florida, launched a standup paddle company primarily dedicated to fishing, BOTE SUP. Now, the SUP fishing industry has inflatable boards like the Fish Stalker to be more easily transported, but inflating does tend to be a hassle vs just pulling a rigid board from your vehicle.

===SUP Yoga===
Nikki Gregg (Oregon) began doing fitness workouts and pilates on stand up boards. Sarah Tiefenthaler (Orange County, California) and Gillian Gibree (San Diego, California) added yet a slightly different spin by bringing their yoga classes to the water on SUP.

==Popularity==
According to the Outdoor Foundation's 2013 Outdoor Participation Report, stand up paddle boarding was listed as the most popular outdoor activity among first-time participants. The report stated that the median age of stand up paddle boarding was 28 years old.

The Outdoor Foundation's 2015 Special Report into Paddlesports found that 2.8 Million (or 0.9%) of Americans participated in standup paddleboarding in 2014. This is up from 2.0 million in 2013. Ages 25–44 made up the highest percentage of overall contributors (47%). The highest participation rate was teenagers ages 14–17 (1.8%), with males comprising 76% of this age bracket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.americancanoe.org/resource/resmgr/General-documents/OIF_PaddlesportsResearch_201.pdf 2015 Special Report into Paddlesports] downloaded from [http://www.americancanoe.org/?page=Statistics American Canoe] on 12 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

New SUP board prices range from US$400 to US$3500, and most use [[glass-reinforced plastic]] construction using [[polyester]] or [[epoxy resin]] that is compatible with the [[polyurethane]] or [[expanded polystyrene]] foam used in the core.  Some SUP boards use a hollow wood construction instead of foam with epoxy resin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barefoot-boards.com|title=Barefoot Boards - Handcrafted Wooden Boards|publisher=www.barefoot-boards.com|accessdate=2011-01-29|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the last few years, inflatable boards have been introduced as well. The boards are generally longer than 9 feet (2,7 m), and can be longer than 12 feet (3,6 m), with features such as padded decks and concave hulls; they generally have one or three surfboard-style fins in the stern for tracking. Boards can also be a short as 7 feet, typically made out of high-performance Carbon Fiber. Boards such as these are used in Stand Up Paddle Surf competitions (smaller boards are more maneuverable). Race boards, which range from 12ft6in to 14&amp;nbsp;ft, are usually made of fiberglass or carbon fiber.

===Inflatable boards===
Performance surf boards were traditionally made from laminated layers over foam cores. SUP boards are larger boards and the desire to travel with them has led to the development of an inflatable system where the board and pump can be carried in a backpack. The core material is called 'drop stitch'. Thousands of locked nylon stitches keep the board at a specific thickness. Pressure from specially designed hand pumps can inflate a board to over 30Psi.&lt;ref name="isuptech"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.belugaboats.com/catalogue/inflatable-paddle-boards/| title=About inflatable SUP boards| accessdate=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a board not much less rigid than a hard board. This makes inflatable paddle boards both durable and transportable.

==Safety and regulations==
Water safety is practiced and regulated by a wide range of overlapping authorities.

===United States===
In many areas of the US, SUP surfing is treated like [[bodysurfing]], [[Bodyboarding|boogie boarding]], or other forms of prone surfing (surfboard riding). No regulations require the use of a [[personal flotation device]] (PFD) while using a SUP board in the surf zone. However, the jurisdictions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Federal Regulations Title 33 Part 2(A)|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=fe2ffdef7096824fc75ef3ab2f1c7b8b&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title33/33cfr2_main_02.tpl|work=e-Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rules requiring a PFD may vary according to the type of water: surf zone, internal waters, harbors and other inland waterways. The US Coast Guard classified SUPs as vessels, like canoes or kayaks. Hence, SUP riders are required to wear a PFD when paddling in certain areas outside of the surf zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Stand Up Paddling: Flatwater to Surf and Rivers|last = Casey|first = Robert|publisher = The Mountaineers Books|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1-59485-253-4|location = Seattle, WA|pages = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, areas such as Myrtle Beach, SC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myrtle Beach Laws - MyrtleBeach.com|url=http://www.myrtlebeach.com/site/pages/myrtle-beach-laws/|work=MyrtleBeach.com|publisher=City of Myrtle Beach|accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Virginia Beach, VA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Ordinances of the City of Virginia Beach|url=http://www.vbgov.com/government/departments/courts/juvenile-domestic-relations-court/Documents/city-prepayable-list.pdf|work=vbgov.com|publisher=City of Virginia Beach|accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; closely regulate beach and surf zones, requiring the use of leashes on a SUP board similar to the law for surfboards. These regulations and requirements may be enforced seasonally during high-tourism seasons or all year. Additionally, it is important to use a quick release belt &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supconnect.com/news/sup-gear/6-essential-sup-safety-items-that-you-should-never-be-without|title=6 Essential SUP Safety Items that You Should Never Be Without|work=SUPconnect|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when paddling in whitewater conditions as this allows the paddler to safely detach from a tangled leash.

===United Kingdom===
No regulations require the use of a personal flotation device (PFD) while using a SUP board in the surf. In flat water environments localised regulations may require the use of a PFD such as on lakes, rivers and inland waterways. In a teaching environment SUP schools and clubs individual risk assessments may require the use of PFD's for less confident stand up paddle boarders. The use of a leash is always recommended in all paddling environments and is a key piece of safety equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supboardermag.com/2015/01/09/a-leash-is-a-necessity-not-an-accessory/|title=A leash is a necessity not an accessory!|work=SUPboarder Mag|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific leashes are designed for specific uses of the paddle board.

==Paddle==
A stand up [[paddle]] is used to propel an individual across the surface of the water while standing on a surfboard. The paddle consists of a blade, shaft and handle.

===Materials and design===
Paddles used for stand up surfing are similar to but longer than traditional canoe paddles. They are usually constructed from carbon, fiberglass or wood with a flat blade on one end connecting to a handle on the other end by a long smooth shaft. The blade ranges from 6 to 10 inches in width with an oval or round shaft ranging from 67 to 86 inches in length with a 1 to 1.5 inch diameter. Blades are designed with several shapes and features. Normally the blade has a [[banana]] peel shape sometimes with a slight keel on the back side of the blade. Other commonly used shapes include diamonds, or oars. Different blade shapes are sometimes used for different types of paddling conditions (long-distance, flat lake water versus ocean surf for example).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surfprodesigns.com/index.asp-Q-Page-E-the-abcs-of-sup-boards-with-advice-choosing-equipment |title=The ABC's of SUP boards with advice on choosing equipment |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603114920/http://www.surfprodesigns.com/index.asp-Q-Page-E-the-abcs-of-sup-boards-with-advice-choosing-equipment |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use===
The proper form for paddle surfing requires a paddle of the correct length and size. A common rule of thumb is a "[[Shaka sign|shaka]]" length,  or 5 to 7 inches, above the rider's height for surfing and about 10 inches above rider's head for racing. Paddles are held with two hands, using a wide grip instead of keeping the hands close together. The proper way to hold the paddle is with the blade tilted away from the body. This propels the paddler through the water quicker. The push-pull method is the most effective way of paddling when stand up paddle boarding. This method requires inserting the paddle gently into the water ahead of the feet, and then pulling it backwards and lifting it back out of the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justpaddleboard.com/proper-paddle-form/|title=How To Hold A SUP Paddle The Right Way • Just Paddleboard|date=2015-09-30|website=Just Paddleboard|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sudduth Coliseum''', in the [[Lake Charles Civic Center]], is a 7,450-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], USA.  Located on Lakeshore Drive, it is the main arena of the Lake Charles Civic Center. It is a venue for hosting concerts and special events, including the 2006 Louisiana State Choir festival and Contraband Days. The center is named for former Lake Charles [[Mayor]] [[James Sudduth]].

It also serves as a host for gun shows, professional wrestling, dance performances, professional and amateur fights, school field trips and The National Day of Prayer ceremony in Lake Charles. [[Contraband Days]] is a large festival held on the grounds. The center served as a shelter for displaced residents whose homes were devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina|Hurricanes Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]]. 

The center also hosted UFC 22: There Can Be Only One Champion, as well as [[UFC 24]]. It also holds Rampage in the Cage events. It also used to be the home stadium of Lake Charles' former pro hockey team, the [[Lake Charles Ice Pirates]] who played in the [[Western Professional Hockey League]] and the [[Louisiana Swashbucklers]] of the [[Professional Indoor Football League (2012)|Professional Indoor Football League]].  The center was authorized as the location of an [[American Basketball Association (2000–present)|American Basketball Association]] team, the [[Lake Charles Hurricanes]]. However, lack of funding caused the team to fold without playing a single game.

The coliseum was also the former home of the [[McNeese State Cowboys basketball]] team from 1972–1986 when the team moved to the [[Burton Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcneesesports.com/news/2014/1/20/MBB_0120140427.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Its former director, [[Allen "Puddler" Harris]], is a former member of the bands of [[Ricky Nelson]], [[Conway Twitty]], and [[Jimmie Davis]].

'''Trunks''' are brief [[shorts]], loose-fitting or tight, worn for sports, especially boxing, swimming, and track.&lt;ref name="RH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/trunk |title=Trunk |work=Random House Unabridged Dictionary |year=1997 |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/trunks#trunks_1 |title=Trunks |work=Collins English Dictionary |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When worn as a [[swimsuit]], trunks are often referred to as ''swimming trunks'' or ''bathing trunks'' (or with the more general term ''[[bathing suit]]'' or a synonym) and are normally shorter than [[board shorts]], which extend to the knees. Trunks are the most popular type of male swimsuit in [[North America]]. They vary in style and design, though most are made of [[nylon]] with a mesh [[lining (sewing)|lining]] for quick drying.

==Other usage==
In [[British English]], the term ''trunks'' is used as in American English as described above, but it can also refer to men's [[underpants]] with legs that reach mid thigh, alternatively called [[boxer briefs]].&lt;ref name="collins" /&gt;

In [[American English]], the term is sometimes used to refer to [[trunk hose]], defined by the ''Collins American English Dictionary'' as "full, baggy breeches reaching about halfway down the thigh, worn in the 16th and 17th cent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/trunks?showCookiePolicy=true |title=Trunks |work=Collins American English Dictionary |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
