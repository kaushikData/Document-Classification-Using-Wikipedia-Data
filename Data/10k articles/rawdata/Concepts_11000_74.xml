'''3-Nitrooxypropanol''', abbreviated '''3NOP''', is an [[organic compound]] with the formula HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is the mono[[nitrate ester]] of [[1,3-Propanediol|1,3-propanediol]].  The compound is an [[enzyme inhibitor| inhibitor]] of the enzyme [[Coenzyme-B sulfoethylthiotransferase|methyl coenzyme M reductase]] (MCR). MCR catalyzes the final step in [[methanogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hristov, A. N., et al., "An inhibitor persistently decreased enteric methane emission from dairy cows with no negative effect on milk production", Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015, volume 112, 10663-10668. {{DOI|10.1073/pnas.1504124112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When it is fed to [[ruminant]]s, their methane production is diminished and they gain weight.  Ruminants are some of the greatest contributors of methane, a significant [[greenhouse gas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12514">A sixteen year old youth was shown on video assaulting a fifteen year old Syrian refugee boy in a playground attack in [[West Yorkshire]]. The attack took place at [[Almondbury Community School]]; the headmaster condemned the attack once it had received nationwide media attention.&lt;ref name="ParentLetter"&gt;{{cite web |title=Message from headteacher to parents 30.11.2018k |url=https://www.almondburycs.org.uk/attachments/download.asp?file=691&amp;type=pdf |website=www.almondburycs.org.uk |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The incident was condemned by Prime Minister [[Theresa May]].&lt;ref name=mirror-Almondbury-MAY&gt;{{cite news|title=Theresa May blasts sickening video of Syrian boy 'waterboarded' in UK school|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/theresa-blasts-sickening-video-syrian-13669106|accessdate=1 December 2018|work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|date=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assault on Syrian refugees==
The clip shows the victim with his arm in a cast being dragged to the floor by his neck as his attacker says "I'll drown you" on a school playing field, while forcing water from a bottle into the victim's mouth, simulating [[waterboarding]].&lt;ref name=telegraph-Almondbury-assault/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matthews|first1=Alex|title=Family of ‘bully’ who ‘waterboarded’ Syrian refugee gets police guard after being ‘driven out of home in middle of night by vigilantes’ as he’s charged by cops|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7845263/bullying-syrian-refugee-huddersfield/|accessdate=28 November 2018|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was filmed in a lunch break. The clips shows the victim walking away, without reacting, as the attacker and others can be heard continuing to verbally abuse him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-46369501| title=Huddersfield school refugee 'attack' video: Boy, 16, to be charged| work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim, a Syrian refugee, had previously suffered a broken wrist; this had also been investigated by the police, who had interviewed three youths but took no further action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Georgina|title=Boy, 16, to appear before youth court after video of assault on Syrian refugee at Almondbury Community School goes viral|url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/crime/boy-16-to-appear-before-youth-court-after-video-of-assault-on-syrian-refugee-at-almondbury-community-school-goes-viral-1-9466265|accessdate=28 November 2018|work=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]|date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subsequently, a separate video emerged of a girl – reportedly the younger sister of the Syrian refugee – also being assaulted in the school playground.&lt;ref name=standard-Almondbury-assault&gt;{{cite news|title=New footage emerges of 'sister of bullied Syrian refugee' being attacked at school|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/new-footage-emerges-of-sister-of-bullied-syrian-refugee-being-attacked-at-school-a4003066.html|accessdate=28 November 2018|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously a girl forcibly removed the girl's hijab; the attacker was excluded from the school over the incident.&lt;ref name=guardian-Almondbury-assault&gt;{{cite news|title=Family of bullied Syrian schoolboy considering leaving Huddersfield|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/28/schoolboy-to-be-charged-over-huddersfield-attack-on-refugee-15|accessdate=28 November 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 November 2018| last=Parveen| first=Nazia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girl was subjected to so much playground abuse and racist attack, she attempted suicide by cutting her wrists between classes, according to the family's lawyer.&lt;ref name=mirror-Almondbury-assault&gt;{{cite news|title='Waterboarded' Syrian refugee's sister attempted suicide after headscarf attack|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/waterboarded-syrian-refugees-sister-attempted-13658472|accessdate=28 November 2018|work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|date=28 November 2018| last=Clarke-Billings| first=Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director of Advocacy at the [[Refugee Council]], said: "The idea that someone escapes war and brutality, only to be met with violence here, is truly awful."&lt;ref name=telegraph-Almondbury-assault&gt;{{cite news|title=Teenager to be charged with assault after 'Syrian refugee' is allegedly attacked at Huddersfield school|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/28/police-investigating-attack-syrian-refugee-huddersfield-school/|accessdate=28 November 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victims plea for assistance before filmed attack===
[[Huddersfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Huddersfield]] MP, [[Barry Sheerman]], said that the 15-year-old victim came to his office in late October asking for help: “The young man himself turned up at my office and told me he was being bullied and appealed for my help".&lt;ref name=hugg-Almondbury-assault&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: Syrian Boy Who Was Victim Of Alleged Attack Begged MP For Help Against Bullies|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/syrian-boy-who-was-victim-of-alleged-racist-attack-begged-mp-for-help-against-bullies_uk_5bfecb4fe4b0e254c926ca4e|accessdate=29 November 2018|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=29 November 2018| last=Day| first=Aasma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheerman reported the allegations to council leader at Kirklees, and the Head of Children’s Services. 

[[Almondbury]]'s Conservative Councillor, Bernard McGuin, revealed Jamal wrote to authorities in a desperate plea for help three weeks before the filmed attack. In the email entitled “complaint: please help me”, the youngster said he had been subjected to bullying since he joined the school two years ago in year 9 and listed “incidents and allegations” at the school.&lt;ref name=independent-Almondbury-incident&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian refugee attacked at Huddersfield school asks people not to threaten alleged bully|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/syrian-refugee-boy-bully-school-jamal-video-huddersfield-almondbury-community-a8662411.html|accessdate=2 December 2018|work=[[The Independent]]|date=1 December 2018| last=Drury| first=Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Suspect===
A 16-year-old boy has been interviewed by [[West Yorkshire Police ]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.westyorkshire.police.uk/news-appeals/update-assault-almondbury-community-school-huddersfield| title=UPDATE: Assault, Almondbury Community School, Huddersfield.| work=[[West Yorkshire Police ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported for summons for an offense of assault. The 16-year-old suspect had shared numerous posts from far-right social media accounts.&lt;ref name=independent-Almondbury-rightwing&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian refugee attack: Family plan to sue Tommy Robinson over allegations against teenage victim|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/syrian-refugee-school-attack-huddersfield-tommy-robinson-family-sue-victim-police-a8659921.html|accessdate=30 November 2018|work=[[The Independent]]|date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspect’s mother had previously been prosecuted over racist behaviour.&lt;ref name=inews-Almondbury-ofstead/&gt;The mother's case reached court in November 2017, where she ­admitted racially ­aggravated ­threatening behaviour and was fined.&lt;ref name=mirror-Almondbury-mother&gt;{{cite news|title=Mum of 'bully' accused of waterboarding refugee boy is a convicted racist|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mum-schoolboy-accused-waterboarding-refugee-13672146|accessdate=2 December 2018|work=[[The Sunday People]]|date=2 December 2018| last=Cardy| first=Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
On 27th Nov 2018, protesters took part in a peaceful demonstration outside the school organised by the'' 'Huddersfield Pakistani Community Alliance'''.&lt;ref name=guardian-Almondbury-jamal&gt;{{cite news|title=Bullied Syrian refugee says he will not return to Huddersfield school|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/29/bullied-syrian-refugee-huddersfield-school|accessdate=29 November 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 November 2018| last=Parveen| first=Nazia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Victim, identified as Jamal, told [[the Guardian]] that he and his sister did not wish to return to school and a solicitor representing the family indicated they were considering moving away from the area.&lt;ref name=guardian-Almondbury-jamal/&gt; 

Jamal asked people not to attack his alleged bully and was alarmed by the violent threats being made online towards the alleged attacker.&lt;ref name=guardian-Almondbury-robinson/&gt;

The school is to face an emergency inspection by [[Ofsted]]. Amanda Spielman, Chief Inspector of Schools, said she was “appalled” by the video and had received complaints from people dismayed by the video.&lt;ref name=times-Almondbury-ofstead&gt;{{cite news|title=Almondbury, the school in Jamal bully video, faces Ofsted inspection|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/almondbury-the-school-in-jamal-bully-video-faces-ofsted-inspection-5t0dxznfk|accessdate=2 December 2018|work=[[The Times]]|date=2 December 2018| last=Griffiths| first=Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inews-Almondbury-ofstead&gt;{{cite news|title=School attended by Syrian refugee filmed being bullied faces emergency Ofsted inspection|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/syrian-refugee-teenager-attack-almondbury-community-school-attack-ofsted-inspection/|accessdate=2 December 2018|work=[[iNews]]|date=2 December 2018| last=Alibhai| first=Zaina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False claims===
[[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]] incorrectly claimed the Syrian refugee had previously attacked two schoolgirls. &lt;ref name=guardian-Almondbury-robinson&gt;{{cite news|title='Waterboarded' Syrian refugee's sister attempted suicide after headscarf attack|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/30/syrian-boy-jamal-asks-people-not-to-attack-his-alleged-bully-huddersfield|accessdate=30 November 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 November 2018| last=Parveen| first=Nazia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just hours after spreading the claims during two [[Facebook live]] broadcasts, Robinson admitted to his followers that he had helped spread fake news. Explaining he had been duped: “I have been completely had, how embarrassing man".&lt;ref name=standard-Almondbury-robinson&gt;{{cite news|title=Tommy Robinson admits he shared 'fake news' about Muslims attacking boy at school where Syrian refugee was filmed being bullied|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/tommy-robinson-admits-he-shared-fake-news-about-muslims-attacking-boy-at-school-was-syrian-refugee-a4005301.html|accessdate=30 November 2018|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syrian refugee family’s lawyers, ''Farooq Bajwa &amp; Co'', issued a letter to Robinson stating "We wish to place you on notice that our client intends to pursue legal action against you in respect of these contents of these publications and you will shortly be receiving formal pre-action correspondence in this respect".&lt;ref name=standard-Almondbury-robinson/&gt; [[CNN International]] reported Robinson had deleted the videos and admitted to posting a fake photograph purporting to show violence by a Muslim gang.&lt;ref name=CNN-Almondbury-robinson&gt;{{cite news|title=Far-right activist Tommy Robinson removes videos after legal threat|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/uk/tommy-robinson-syrian-refugee-gbr-intl-scli/index.html|accessdate=30 November 2018|work=[[CNN International]]|date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the photos used by Robinson as supposed proof of violence at the school was stolen from a 2017 news article on a teenage cancer patient from Surrey.&lt;ref name=independent-Almondbury-rightwing/&gt;

==Other incidents on school playground==
In Nov 2018, a third video emerged which showed an assault of a young girl that was filmed by pupils in what appears to be a pre-arranged fight. It shows youngsters at the school gathered round on the drive by the playing fields encouraging two girls to fight.&lt;ref name=examiner-Almondbury-video&gt;{{cite news|title=Is behaviour at Almondbury Community School out of control?

An '''animal bite''' is a [[wound]], usually a puncture or laceration, caused by the teeth. An animal bite usually results in a break in the skin but also includes contusions from the excessive pressure on body tissue from the bite. The contusions can occur without a break in the skin. Bites can be provoked or unprovoked. Other bite attacks may be apparently unprovoked. &lt;!--Self-inflicted bites occur in some genetic illnesses, such as [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]]. get a citation for this statement --&gt; Biting is a physical action not only describing an attack but it is a normal response in an animal as it eats, carries objects, softens and prepares food for its young, removes [[ectoparasites]] from its body surface, removes plant seeds attached to its fur or hair, scratching itself, and grooming other animals. Animal bites often result in serious infections and mortality. Animal bites not only include injuries from the teeth of reptiles, mammals, but fish, and amphibians. Arthropods can also bite and leave injuries.

==Signs and symptoms==
Bite wounds can cause a number of signs and symptoms
*Generalized tissue damage due to tearing and scratching
*Serious [[hemorrhage]] if major blood vessels are pierced
*[[Infection]] by [[bacterium|bacteria]] or other [[pathogen]]s, including rabies
*Introduction of [[Venom (poison)|venom]] into the wound by venomous animals such as some [[snakes]]
*Introduction of other irritants into the wound, causing [[inflammation]] and [[itching]]

==Classification==

Bites are usually classified by the type of animal causing the wound.
Many different animals are known to bite humans.

===Vertebrates===
[[File:Jaw of the piranha.jpg|thumb|Jaw of the piranha with biting equipment displayed]]
*Companion animals, including [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[ferret]]s, and [[companion parrot|parrots]], may bite humans.
*[[Wildlife]] may sometimes bite humans. The bites of various mammals such as [[bat]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[gray wolf|wolves]], [[raccoon]]s, etc. may transmit [[rabies]], which is almost always fatal if left untreated.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Involuntary [[biting]] injuries due to [[closed-fist injuries]] from fists striking teeth (referred to as [[Reverse bite injury|reverse bite injuries]]) are a common consequence of [[Hand to hand combat|fist fights]]. These have been termed "fight bites". Injuries in which the [[knuckle joint]]s or [[tendon]]s of the hand are bitten into tend to be the most serious.

Teething infants are known to bite objects to relieve pressure on their growing teeth, and may inadvertently bite people's hands or arms while doing so. Young children may also bite people out of anger or misbehaviour, although this is usually corrected early in the child's life.

===Reverse bite injury===
A reverse bite injury (also called a clenched fist injury, closed fist injury, or fight bite) results when, a person punches another person in the face, and the skin (and sometimes tendons) of their knuckles are cut against the teeth of the person they are punching.&lt;ref name="PerronMiller2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1053/ajem.2002.31146 |title=Orthopedic pitfalls in the ED: Fight bite |journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=114–117 |year=2002 |last1=Perron |first1=Andrew D. |last2=Miller |first2=Mark D. |last3=Brady |first3=William J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity of the wound is often located over the [[metacarpophalangeal joint]] resulting in tendon injury.&lt;ref name="HenryPurcell2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/emj.2006.045054 |pmid=17582031 |pmc=2658386 |title=The human bite injury: A clinical audit and discussion regarding the management of this alcohol fuelled phenomenon |journal=Emergency Medicine Journal |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=455–458 |year=2007 |last1=Henry |first1=F. P. |last2=Purcell |first2=E. M. |last3=Eadie |first3=P. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical treatment of this injury is similar to those of a [[Human biting injuries|human bite]], but may also involve damage of the underlying tendons.&lt;ref name="ShewringTrickett2015"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1753193415576249 |pmid=25770897 |title=The management of clenched fist 'fight bite' injuries of the hand |journal=Journal of Hand Surgery (European Volume) |volume=40 |issue=8 |pages=819–824 |year=2015 |last1=Shewring |first1=D. J. |last2=Trickett |first2=R. W. |last3=Subramanian |first3=K. N. |last4=Hnyda |first4=R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These injuries should be managed as other human bites: wound irrigation and [[antibiotics]] are essential as human saliva can contain a number of bacteria.&lt;ref name="TalanAbrahamian2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/379331 |pmid=14614671 |title=Clinical Presentation and Bacteriologic Analysis of Infected Human Bites in Patients Presenting to Emergency Departments |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=37 |issue=11 |pages=1481–1489 |year=2003 |last1=Talan |first1=D.

===Arthropods===
The bites of arthropods have some of the most serious health consequences known. Mosquito bites transmit serious disease and result in millions of deaths and illnesses in the world. Ticks also transmit many diseases such as [[Lyme disease]].

==Mechanism==

=== Trauma ===
One of the first consequences of a bite is the trauma inflicted upon tissue. Some animals involved in inflicting bites are also receiving them during the confrontation. Trauma includes scratching of the skin surface, tooth loss, puncture wounds, superficial and deep lacerations, amputations, and the ripping off of skin and hair. If major blood vessels are damaged, severe blood loss can occur.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

=== Infection ===
Pathogen organisms can be introduced into the bite. Some of the pathogens can originate from the mouth of the 'biter', the substrate onto which the injured person or animal can fall or from the naturally occurring microorganisms that are present on the skin or hair of the animal. The advent of antibiotics improved the outcome of bite wound infections.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

===Rabies===
Animal bites where skin has been penetrated, most commonly dogs and [[bat]]s, transmit rabies to humans.&lt;ref name=WHO2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabies Fact Sheet N°99|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=10 January 2015|date=Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabies from other animals is rare.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; If the animal is caught alive or dead with its head preserved, the head can be analyzed to detect the disease. Signs of rabies include foaming at the mouth, growling, self-mutilation, jerky behavior, red eyes, and [[Rabies#Hydrophobia|hydrophobia]].

If the animal cannot be captured, preventative rabies treatment is recommended in many places. Several countries are known not to have native rabies, see the Wikipedia page for [[Prevalence of rabies#Rabies-free jurisdictions|prevalence of rabies]].

==Treatment==
The first step in treatment includes washing the bite wound.&lt;ref name=WHO2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal bites Fact sheet N°373|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs373/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a low risk of infection the wound may be sutured.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; Debridement and drainage bite wounds was practiced in the pre-antibiotic era, but still had a high infection rate.

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotics to prevent infection are recommended for dog and cat bites of the hand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1021 |title=Antibiotics in cat bites |website=BestBets }}&lt;/ref&gt; and human bites if they are more than superficial.&lt;ref name="Oehler2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70110-0 |pmid=19555903 |title=Bite-related and septic syndromes caused by cats and dogs |journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=439–447 |year=2009 |last1=Oehler |first1=Richard L. |last2=Velez |first2=Ana P. |last3=Mizrachi |first3=Michelle |last4=Lamarche |first4=Jorge |last5=Gompf |first5=Sandra |citeseerx=10.1.1.490.2232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also recommended in those who have [[immunodeficiency|poor immune function]].&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; Evidence for antibiotics to prevent infection in bites in other areas is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001738 |pmid=11406003 |title=Antibiotic prophylaxis for mammalian bites |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=2 |pages=CD001738 |year=2001 |last1=Medeiros |first1=Iara Marques |last2=Saconato |first2=Humberto }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first choice is [[amoxicillin with clavulanic acid]], and if the person is penicillin-allergic, [[doxycycline]] and [[metronidazole]].&lt;ref name="Oehler2009"/&gt; The antistaphylococcal penicillins (e.g., [[cloxacillin]], [[nafcillin]], [[flucloxacillin]]) and the [[macrolide]]s (e.g., [[erythromycin]], [[clarithromycin]]) are not used for empirical therapy, because they do not cover ''[[Pasteurella]]'' species.&lt;ref name="Oehler2009"/&gt;

===Vaccinations===
Rabies prevention is generally available in [[North America]] and the [[Northern European]] states.

[[Tetanus toxoid]] treatment is recommended in those whose vaccinations are not up to date and have a bite that punctures the skin.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; [[Tetanus immune globulin]] is indicated in people with more than 10 years since prior vaccination. Tetanus boosters (Td) should be given every ten years.

===Mosquito bites===
{{main|Insect bites and stings}}

[[Antihistamines]] are effective treatment for the symptoms from bites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1074 |title=BestBets: Oral antihistamines for insect bites |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[Dengue fever|dengue]] are transmitted by [[mosquitoes]].

== Epidemiology ==
Human bites are the third most frequent type of bite after dog and cat bites.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014&gt;{{cite book | last = Cherry | first = James | title = Feigin and Cherry's textbook of pediatric infectious diseases – Animal and Human Bites, Morven S. Edwards | publisher = Elsevier/Saunders | location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-1-4557-1177-2 }}{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dog bites]] are commonplace, with children the most commonly bitten and the face the most common target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dogbitelaw.com/PAGES/statistics.html |title= Dog Bite Statistics |author = Kenneth M. Phillips |date= 2009-12-27 |accessdate= 2010-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 4.7 million [[dog bite]]s are reported annually in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/dog_care/stay_dog_bite_free/questions_and_answers_about_dog_bites/ Questions and Answers about Dog Bites] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304025320/http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/dog_care/stay_dog_bite_free/questions_and_answers_about_dog_bites/ |date=4 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US estimated annual count of animal bites is 250,000 human bites, 1 to 2 million dog bites, 400,000 cat bites, and 45,000 bites from snakes. Bites from skunks, horses, squirrels, rats, rabbits, pigs, and [[monkey bite|monkey]]s may be up to 1 percent of bite injuries. Pet ferrets attacks that were unprovoked have caused serious facial injuries. Non-domesticated animals though assumed to be more common especially as a cause of rabies infection, make up less than one percent of reported bite wounds. When a person is bitten, it is more likely to occur on the right arm, most likely due to defensive reactions when the person uses their dominant arm. Estimates are that three quarters of bites are located on the arms or legs of humans. Bites to the face of humans constitute only 10 percent of the total. Two thirds of bite injuries in humans are suffered by children aged ten and younger.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

Up to three fourths of dog bites happen to those younger than 20 years-old. In the United States, the costs associated with dog bites are estimated to be more than $1 billion annually. The age groups that suffer most from dog bites are children 5 to 9 years-old. Often, bites go unreported and no medical treatment given - these bites go unreported. As many as one percent of pediatric emergency room visits are for treatment for animal bites. This is more frequent during the summer months. Up to five percent of children receiving emergency care for dog bites are then admitted to the hospital. Bites typically occur in the late afternoon and early evening. Girls are bitten more frequently by cats than they are by dogs. Boys are bitten by dogs two times more often than girls are bitten by dogs.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

== History ==

The bites of humans are recorded during the biblical area. Reports of secondary infection occurring after a human bite in children have been noted in the United States since at least 1910. Morbidity and mortality rates improved with the use of antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5519">'''Argument-deduction-proof distinctions''' originated with logic itself.&lt;ref name=Corcoran2009&gt;
{{cite journal
  |last=Corcoran|first=John|authorlink=John Corcoran (logician)
  |title=Aristotle's Demonstrative Logic
  |journal=History and Philosophy of Logic
  |volume=30|year=2009|pages=1–20 |doi=10.1080/01445340802228362
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, the terminology evolved. 
==Argument==
An '''[[argument]]''', more fully a premise-conclusion argument, is a two-part system composed of premises and conclusion. An argument is [[Validity (logic)|''valid'']] [[if and only if]] its conclusion is a [[Logical consequence|consequence]] of its premises. Every premise set has infinitely many consequences each giving rise to a valid argument. Some consequences are obviously so but most are not: most are hidden consequences. Most valid arguments are not yet known to be valid. To determine validity in non-obvious cases deductive reasoning is required. There is no deductive reasoning in an argument ''per se''; such must come from the outside. 

Every argument's conclusion is a premise of other arguments. The word ''constituent'' may be used for either a premise or conclusion.In the context of this article and in most classical contexts, all candidates for consideration as argument constituents fall under the category of [[truth-bearer]]: propositions, statements, sentences, judgments, etc.

==Deduction==
A '''deduction''' is a three-part system composed of premises, a conclusion, and chain of intermediates — steps of reasoning showing that its conclusion is a [[logical consequence|consequence]] of its premises. The reasoning in a deduction is by definition cogent. Such reasoning itself, or the chain of intermediates representing it, has also been called an argument, more fully a [[deductive argument]]. In many cases, an argument can be known to be valid by means of a deduction of its conclusion from its premises but non-deductive methods such as [[Venn diagrams]] and other graphic procedures have been proposed.

==Proof==
A '''[[Formal proof|proof]]''' is a deduction whose premises are known truths. A [[Mathematical proof|proof]] of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is a deduction that might use several premises — [[axiom]]s, postulates, and definitions — and contain dozens of intermediate steps. As [[Alfred Tarski]] famously emphasized in accord with [[Aristotle]], truths can be known by proof but proofs presuppose truths not known by proof.
==Comparison==
Premise-conclusion arguments do not require or produce either knowledge of validity or knowledge of truth. Premise sets may be chosen arbitrarily and conclusions may be chosen arbitrarily. 
Deductions require knowing how to reason but they do not require knowledge of truth of their premises. Deductions produce knowledge of the validity of arguments but ordinarily they do not produce knowledge of the truth of their conclusions.
Proofs require knowledge of the truth of their premises, they require knowledge of deductive reasoning, and they produce knowledge of their conclusions.
==Context==
Modern logicians disagree concerning the nature of argument constituents.[[Willard Van Orman Quine| Quine]] devotes the first chapter of ''Philosophy of Logic'' to this issue.&lt;ref&gt;WILLARD QUINE, ''Philosophy of logic'', Harvard, 1970/1986. &lt;/ref&gt; Historians have not even been able to agree on what [[Aristotle]] took as constituents.&lt;ref&gt; JOHN CORCORAN, Aristotle's syllogistic premises. Bulletin of Symbolic Logic. 18 (2012) 300–1. &lt;/ref&gt;


Argument-deduction-proof distinctions are inseparable from what have been called the ''consequence-deducibility'' distinction and the ''truth-and-consequence conception of proof''.&lt;ref name=Corcoran2009/&gt; Variations among argument-deduction-proof distinctions are not all terminological.

Logician [[Alonzo Church]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Church|first=Alonzo|authorlink=Alonzo Church
  |title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic
  |publisher=Princeton University Press
  |year=1956
|isbn=9780691029061}}&lt;/ref&gt; never used the word ''argument'' in the above sense and had no synonym. Moreover, Church never explained that deduction is the process of producing knowledge of consequence and it never used the common noun ''deduction'' for an application of the deduction process. His primary focus in discussing proof was “conviction” produced by generation of chains of logical truths—not the much more widely applicable and more familiar general process of demonstration as found in pre-Aristotelian geometry and discussed by Aristotle.&lt;ref name=Corcoran2009/&gt; He did discuss deductions in the above sense but not by that name: he called them awkwardly “proofs from premises” — an expression he coined for the purpose.

The absence of argument-deduction-proof distinctions is entirely consonant with Church's avowed [[Plato]]nistic logicism. Following [[Michael Dummett|Dummett's]] insightful remarks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |first=Michael|last=Dummett|authorlink=Michael Dummett

}}&lt;/ref&gt; about [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], which — ''[[mutatis mutandis]]'' — apply even more to Church, it might be possible to explain the today-surprising absence.

'''Carlos Ginzburg''' is a [[conceptual artist]] and theoretician born in 1946 in [[La Plata]], [[Argentina]]. He studied [[philosophy]] and social theory.

==Biography==

[[Germano Celant]], when writing about [[Arte Povera]], invited Ginzburg by letter to join his movement.

As a conceptual artist interested in [[digital art]], [[fractals]] [[chaos theory|chaos]] and [[fractal art]], Ginzburg created what he calls "homo fractalus" – a concept about microcosm totality.&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/leonardo/v034/34.1ginzburg.html The Leonardo Gallery : Carlos Ginzburg&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worked with the art critic [[Pierre Restany]] (with whom he developed the concept of "Political Ecology")&lt;ref&gt;Curator Pierre Restany, Political Ecology, White Box, New York, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Severo Sarduy]] who put him near [[Hokusai]] in "Barroco", one of the reference's books to ''Le Pli'' of [[Gilles Deleuze]].

He lives in Paris and works, since 2005, with the art criticism and French artist [[KolbaSha/Tschann]] on chaos's destruction and advent paradise.

A '''clipping path''' (or "deep etch"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=93 |title=How to start and produce a magazine or newsletter |author=Gordon Woolf S|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzSzC0VXU_UC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=deep+etching+photoshop&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iMaoTqXLJcn2mAWr9-mjDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a closed [[vector path]], or shape, used to cut out a [[2D computer graphics|2D image]] in [[image editing]] software. Anything inside the path will be included after the clipping path is applied; anything outside the path will be omitted from the output. Applying the clipping path results in a [[aliasing|hard (aliased) or soft (anti-aliased) edge]], depending on the image editor's capabilities[[File:Clipping Path.jpg|thumb|Clipping path]]

By convention, the inside of the path is defined by its direction. Reversing the direction of a path reverses what is considered inside or outside. An ''inclusive path'' is one where what is visually "inside" the path corresponds to what will be preserved; an ''exclusive path'', of opposite direction, contains what is visually "outside" the path. By convention, a clockwise path that is non-self-intersecting is considered inclusive.

A '''compound path''' results from the combination of multiple paths (inclusive and exclusive) and the Boolean operations that ultimately determine what the combined path contains. For instance, an inclusive path which contains a smaller exclusive path results in a shape with a "hole" (defined by the exclusive path).

One common use of a clipping path is to cull objects that do not need to be rendered because they are outside the user's [[viewport]] or obscured by display elements (such as a [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUD]]).

==In 3D graphics==
{{main|Clipping (computer graphics)}}
Clipping [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s are used in [[3D computer graphics]] in order to prevent the renderer from calculating surfaces at an extreme distance from the viewer. The plane is perpendicular to the [[camera]], a set distance away (the ''threshold''), and occupies the entire viewport. Used in real-time [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]], clipping planes can help preserve processing for objects within clear sight.

The use of clipping planes can result in a detraction from the realism of a scene, as the viewer may notice that everything at the threshold is not rendered correctly or seems to (dis)appear spontaneously. The addition of ''fog''—a variably transparent region of color or texture just before the clipping plane—can help soften the transition between what should be in plain sight and [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], and what should be beyond notice and fully [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]], and therefore does not need to be rendered.

==Clipping path service==
Clipping path services are professional offerings provided by companies for extracting objects or people from still imagery, and typically includes other [[Image editing|photo editing]] and [[photo manipulation|manipulation]] services. Addressees of such services are primarily photography and graphic design studios, advertising agencies, web designers, as well as lithographers and printing companies. Clipping path service companies commonly reside in [[developing countries]] such as [[Bangladesh]], [[Philippine]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Nepal]], which can provide their services at comparatively low cost to developed countries, fostering [[outsourcing]] of such activities.

==Co-benefits in policy-making==
Co-benefits of GHG mitigation can be an important decision criteria in analyses carried out by policy-makers, but they are often neglected, and often the co-benefits are not quantified, monetised or even identified by businesses and decision-makers. Appropriate consideration of co-benefits can greatly influence policy decisions concerning the timing and level of mitigation action, and there can be significant advantages to the national economy and technical innovation.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt;

==Co-benefits in research ==
Different research groups currently examine the impacts of co-benefits of climate change mitigation. One of these projects is the COBENEFITS project of the [[Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies]] in [[Potsdam]], Germany. The COBENEFITS project is part of the International Climate Initiative (IKI). The [[Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] (BMU) supports this initiative on the basis of a decision adopted by the German [[Bundestag]]. The project is conducted in close collaboration with government ministries, agencies, research institutions, and think tanks as political partners and knowledge partners in the target countries. These four target countries are [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Turkey]], and [[Vietnam]]. The project team, thereby, cooperates with national authorities and knowledge partners to develop key insights that enable them to mobilise these co-benefits in their countries and accelerate domestic processes aimed at achieving their international climate protection commitments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cobenefits.info/&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in some countries, when an exile is enjoined not to return on pain of death, it is deemed a comminatory penalty, since, if he did return, it is not strictly executed, but instead the same threat is laid on him again, which is more than comminatory.

[[File:SmileyFaceLaserGrafitti.jpg|thumb|Laser Graffiti in Vienna, August 31, 2007]]

'''Digital graffiti''' is the act of creating [[graffiti]] art using a [[computer vision]] system. Various groups and companies have pioneered digital graffiti since technology advances made it possible. Most notably is the [[Graffiti Research Lab]] based in the US with their [[L.A.S.E.R. Tag]] system.

Inspired by the New York laser graffiti movement, in 2008 the first commercially available digital graffiti wall was produced by Luma, named the [[YrWall]]. A specially adapted spray can emits [[Infrared|IR]] light instead of paint, which is then tracked by a [[computer vision]] system to recreate the "sprayed" image onto the wall using a projector.

Any system that allows art to be created on a large scale in a similar manner to more traditional graffiti falls under the heading digital graffiti.

Cisco Systems has released a mobile application called [Digital Graffiti] patented by [http://www.cisco.com   Cisco Systems, Inc.] to allow people to place messages of varying size, color, length of time visible, and viewing distance (say visible from 20 feet away) on a physical location, say a building, an office, a cubicle, or a specific location using their augmented reality mobile application.  This message alerts other visitors approaching the message coordinates by playing the Cisco chime and the mobile user's country origin filter when the app was installed.  It is like a virtual yellow stickie note, that can be delivered to an individual when they arrive at a message location.  Digital Graffiti leverages the Cisco MSE location server (which tracks users mobile devices and provides x, y coordinates of the mobile devices over WiFi).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geekgaps.com/?page_id=218  Digital Graffiti – the ‘new yellow stickie note’] GeekGaps.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10719">"'''Dirty, dangerous and demeaning'''" (often "'''dirty, dangerous and demanding'''" or "'''dirty, dangerous and difficult'''"), also known as the '''3Ds''', is an American [[neologism]] derived from the Asian concept, and refers to certain kinds of labor often performed by unionized [[blue-collar worker]]s.

The term originated from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] expression 3K: ''[[wiktionary:汚い|'''k'''itanai]]'', ''[[wiktionary:危険|'''k'''iken]]'', ''[[wiktionary:きつい|'''k'''itsui]]''&lt;ref&gt;J. Connell, 1993, ''Kitanai, Kitsui and Kiken: The Rise of Labour Migration to Japan'', Economic &amp; Regional Restructuring Research Unit, University of Sydney&lt;/ref&gt; (respectively 汚い "'''d'''irty", 危険 "'''d'''angerous", きつい "'''d'''emanding"), and has subsequently gained widespread use, particularly regarding labor done by [[migrant worker]]s and [[burakumin]].

Any task fitting the criteria of 3Ds job can qualify, regardless of industry. These jobs can bring higher wages due to a shortage of willing qualified individuals and in many world regions are filled by migrant workers looking for higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Martin, 1996 ''Migrants on the move in Asia'', Asia-Pacific Issues, East West Centre, Washington&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Haque and Ahmad F. Ismail, "Automation in Foundry Kasting Industry", IEEE ICIT’02, Bangkok, THAILAND, 2002 pp 815 -820&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts K. D., "The determinants of job choice by rural labor migrants in Shanghai" China Economic Review, Volume 12, Issue 1, Spring 2001, Pages 15-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oaks.korean.net/download/pdf/05.Usefulinformation_e.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122004049/http://oaks.korean.net/download/pdf/05.Usefulinformation_e.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic status ==

Traditionally, workers in 3D professions are well paid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm |title=United States National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates |publisher=Bls.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{specify|date=July 2016}} due to the undesirability of the work, and the resulting need to pay higher wages to attract workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iom.fi/files/Publications/2007/PIELAMI_Project_Report.pdf PIELAMI Project Report 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014181222/http://iom.fi/files/Publications/2007/PIELAMI_Project_Report.pdf |date=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joohee Lee [http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN020150.pdf "Income Assistance and Employment Creation through Public Works in Korea: Labor Market Reforms in Korea: Policy Options for the Future"] Korea Labor Institute 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This has allowed the uneducated and unskilled to earn a living wage by foregoing comfort, personal safety and [[Social class|social status]]. This concept proves itself in the economic theory of quantity supplied and quantity demanded (see [[Quantity adjustment]]), the wages paid to these workers is higher due to the undesirable nature of their professions.

However, in regions where certain classes of workers are restricted to this type of work or there are contributing regional conditions - for example, high [[unemployment]], adjacent to regions with high [[poverty]], or the recipient of driven labor migration - there will be workers willing to accept lower than equilibrium wages and then these jobs are not well paid. Large scale international [[Human migration|labor migration]], from [[developing country|developing]] to [[developed country|developed countries]] since the late 19th century and early 20th century has provided a pool of migrants willing to undertake employment for lower wages than native residents. Higher wages in developed countries are a strong 'pull' factor in international migration, and thus while a migrant worker is willing to accept a comparatively low-wage for a 3D job in a developed country it may mean a significant increase in wages compared to their originating country.

Prominent current examples of such migration include [[Filipino people|Filipino]] entertainment workers who migrate to [[Japan]], and of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]] and [[Pakistani people|Pakistanis]] going to the [[Middle East]] to work in the construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Attas, ''The Case of Guest Workers: Exploitation, Citizenship and Economic Rights'', v6 n1, January 2000, Springer&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, 3D occupations once filled by [[Irish American#Occupations|Irish]] and German immigrants, are today held by many [[Latin Americans]]. The highest paying work available to these often unskilled and uneducated (or their foreign certificates of skills and education are not recognized) immigrants is work that is of lower social status, and has a higher risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Kenneth|date=2007-03-01|title=The new labor market segmentation: Labor market dualism in the new economy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X06000068|journal=Social Science Research|volume=36|issue=1|pages=286–312|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2005.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ORRENIUS|first=PIA M.|last2=ZAVODNY|first2=MADELINE|date=2009-08-01|title=Do Immigrants Work In Riskier Jobs?|journal=Demography|volume=46|issue=3|pages=535–551|issn=0070-3370|pmc=2831347|pmid=19771943|doi=10.1353/dem.0.0064}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As immigrants make up an increasing share of the labor market in countries such as the United States it will become increasingly important for employers to find ways of effectively promoting occupational safety and health among immigrant workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Michael A|date=2014-06-01|title=Safety &amp; the Diverse Workforce: Lessons From NIOSH's Work With Latino Immigrants|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277211576_Safety_the_Diverse_Workforce_Lessons_From_NIOSH%2527s_Work_With_Latino_Immigrants|journal=Professional safety|volume=59|issue=6|issn=0099-0027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Tom|last2=Flynn|first2=Michael|last3=Weinstock|first3=Deborah|last4=Zanoni|first4=Joseph|date=2014-07-23|title=Occupational Safety and Health Education and Training for Underserved Populations|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264164086_Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Education_and_Training_for_Underserved_Populations|journal=NEW SOLUTIONS A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy|volume=24|issue=1|doi=10.2190/NS.24.1.d|issn=1541-3772|pmc=4540323|pmid=25053607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These workers are susceptible to [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], and without representation can have a difficult time maintaining fair living wages. Since the beginning of the labor movement, immigrant workers in 3D jobs have formed the backbone of many labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christian Karl |url=http://www.labournet.net/world/0401/korea4.html |title=Migrant Worker Union and Immigration Officers Face Off - International Sec. ETU-MB, 08/01/04 |publisher=Labournet.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When there are concentrations of low paid workers in 3D occupations, this is artificially created when there are either 'pull' mechanisms that create migrant worker flows or through mechanisms that create subclasses of indigenous populations, through a selective application or an absence of labor protections.  Undocumented immigration status is one such mechanism which reinforces the social vulnerability of immigrant workers and can increase their risk for occupational injury and limit their access to institutional resources that protect worker health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Michael A.|last2=Eggerth|first2=Donald E.|last3=Jacobson|first3=C. Jeffrey|date=2015-11-01|title=Undocumented status as a social determinant of occupational safety and health: The workers’ perspective|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajim.22531/abstract|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|language=en|volume=58|issue=11|pages=1127–1137|doi=10.1002/ajim.22531|issn=1097-0274}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the worst case the concentration is exploitation and can become [[slavery]] in its various forms. Historically, the 3D occupations have at times been widely satisfied through forced employment due to the lack of available applicants, a supply of exploitable labor, and either legalization of forced employment or a disregard for the labor laws.

People who find themselves working a 3D occupation will be well paid if they have the protection of the law, poorly paid if they have poor protection of the law or unfair laws, and unpaid if they exist under no protection of the law, no law, or in a society with legal slavery.

Regardless of the hazards, engaging in high risk, low status work can be a way to escape poverty - captured by a line in the Irish folk song [[Finnegan's Wake]], "to rise in the world he carried a [[Brick hod|hod]]."

== Risks ==
As the name indicates, dirty, dangerous and demeaning work can impose severe physical and mental costs on workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramos|first=Athena|last2=Carlo|first2=Gustavo|last3=Grant|first3=Kathleen|last4=Bendixsen|first4=Casper|last5=Fuentes|first5=Axel|last6=Gamboa|first6=Rodrigo|last7=Ramos|first7=Athena K.|last8=Carlo|first8=Gustavo|last9=Grant|first9=Kathleen M.|date=2018-09-02|title=A Preliminary Analysis of Immigrant Cattle Feedyard Worker Perspectives on Job-Related Safety Training|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2313-576X/4/3/37|journal=Safety|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=37|doi=10.3390/safety4030037}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is often a risk of early retirement due to injury, general joint depletion or mental fatigue. After witnessing the constant physical and mental injury to coworkers or even death, the stress can cause mental fatigue and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}

The '''doctrine of necessity''' is the basis on which extra-legal actions by state actors, which are designed to restore order, are found to be constitutional. The [[legal maxim|maxim]] on which the doctrine is based originated in the writings of the medieval jurist [[Henry de Bracton]], and similar justifications for this kind of extra-legal action have been advanced by more recent legal authorities, including [[William Blackstone]].

In modern times, the doctrine was first used in a controversial 1954 judgment in which Pakistani Chief Justice [[Muhammad Munir]] validated the extra-constitutional use of emergency powers by [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor General]], [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Ghulam Mohammad]].&lt;ref name="ref16zifem"&gt;{{Citation | title=The post-colonial states of South Asia: democracy, development, and identity | author=Amita Shastri, A. Jeyaratnam Wilson | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, 2001 | isbn=978-0-312-23852-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=du7xvBFpbg4C | quote=''... Dismissing Mirza, army chief General Mohammad Ayub Khan took over first as chief martial law administrator ... a compliant judiciary upheld the imposition of martial law under the doctrine of necessity ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his judgment, the Chief Justice cited [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton's]] [[Legal maxim|maxim]], 'that which is otherwise not lawful is made lawful by necessity', thereby providing the label that would come to be attached to the judgment and the doctrine that it was establishing.

The doctrine of necessity has since been applied in a number of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, and in 2010 was invoked to justify extra-legal actions in [[Nigeria]].

==Pakistan, 1954: First use==
On 24 October 1954 the Governor-General of Pakistan, [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Ghulam Mohammad]], dissolved the [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan|Constituent Assembly]] and appointed a new Council of Ministers on the grounds that the existing one no longer represented the people of Pakistan. [[Stanley Alexander de Smith|Stanley de Smith]] argues that the real reason for the dissolution was because Mohammad objected to the constitution which the Assembly was about to adopt.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf-Phillips, Leslie.  "Constitutional Legitimacy: A Study of the Doctrine of Necessity." ''Third World Quarterly'', Vol. 1, No. 4 (October 1979) 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  The President of the Constituent Assembly, [[Maulvi Tamizuddin]], appealed to the Chief Court of Sind at Karachi to restrain the new Council of Ministers from implementing the dissolution and to determine the validity of the appointment of the new Council under Section 223-A of the constitution.

In response, members of the new Council of Ministers appealed to the court saying that it had no jurisdiction to approve the request of the President to overturn the dissolution and appointments.  They argued that Section 223-A of the constitution had never been validly enacted into the Constitution because it was never approved of by the Governor-General, and therefore anything submitted under it was invalid.  The Chief Court of Sind ruled in favour of President Tamizuddin and held that the Governor-General's approval was not needed when the Constituent Assembly was acting only as a Constituent Assembly and not as the Federal Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Judgement and Order of the Chief Court of Sind at Karachi, 9 February 1955, PLD 1955 Sind 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Federation of Pakistan and the new Council of Ministers then appealed to the court, the appeal was heard in March 1955 (''Federation of Pakistan v Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan'').

In the appeal hearing under Chief Justice Muhammad Munir, the court decided that the Constituent Assembly functioned as the 'Legislature of the Domain' and that the Governor-General's assent was necessary for all legislation to become law.  Therefore, the Chief Court of Sind had no jurisdiction to overturn the Governor General's dissolution and it was held as valid.

However, the ground of which the court found in favour of the Federation of Pakistan called into question the validity of all legislation passed by the Assembly, not to mention the unconstitutionality of the Assembly itself since 1950.  To solve this problem, the Governor-General invoked Emergency Powers to retrospectively validate the Acts of the Constituent Assembly. An appeal was filed against the Governor-General for invoking emergency powers and the Chief Justice had to determine the constitutionality of invoking the Emergency Powers and whether the Governor-General could give his assent to legislation retroactively.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf-Phillips, Leslie.  "Constitutional Legitimacy: A Study of the Doctrine of Necessity." ''Third World Quarterly'', Vol. 1, No. 4 (October 1979) 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court held that in this case the Governor-General could not invoke emergency powers because in doing so he validated certain laws that had been invalid because he had not assented to them previously.  Justice Munir also ruled that constitutional legislation could not be validated by the Governor General but had to be approved by the Legislature.  The lack of a Constituent Assembly did not transfer the Legislature's powers over to the Governor-General.

The Court was referred to for an opinion. On 16 May 1955 it ruled:

# The Governor General in certain circumstances had the power to dissolve the Constituent Assembly.
# The Governor-General has during the interim period the power 'under the common law of civil or state necessity' of retrospectively validating the laws listed in the Schedule to the Emergency Powers ordinance.
#  The new Assembly (formed under the Constituent Convention Order 1955) would be valid and able to exerise all powers under the ''[[Indian Independence Act 1947]]''.&lt;ref&gt;PLD 1955 I FC 561-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In his verdict, Munir declared it was necessary to go beyond the constitution to what he claimed was the Common Law, to general legal maxims, and to English historical precedent. He relied on [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton's]] maxim, 'that which is otherwise not lawful is made lawful by necessity', and the Roman law maxim urged by [[Ivor Jennings]], 'the well-being of the people is the supreme law'.

==Grenada, 1985: Second use==
In a 1985 judgment, the Chief Justice of the High Court of [[Grenada]] invoked the doctrine of necessity to validate the legal existence of a court then trying for murder the persons who had conducted a coup against former leader [[Maurice Bishop]]. The court had been established under an unconstitutional "People's Law" following the overthrow of the country's constitution, which had subsequently been restored. The defendants argued that the court before which they were being tried had no legal existence under the restored constitution, and they were therefore being deprived of their constitutional right to a trial before a "Court established by law". The High Court acknowledged that the lower court "had come into existence in an unconstitutional manner", but "the doctrine of necessity validated its acts."&lt;ref&gt;[[H.V. Evatt]] and [[Eugene Forsey]], ''Evatt and Forsey on the Reserve Powers''. (Sydney: Legal Books, 1990), p. xciv.&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, the murder trials were allowed to proceed.

==Nigeria, 2010: Nigerian parliament creates an Acting President==
A related (although non-judicial) use of the doctrine took place when, on 9 February 2010, the [[Nigeria]]n National Assembly passed a resolution making Vice President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] the Acting President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. Both chambers of the Assembly passed the resolution after President [[Umaru Yar'Adua]], who for 78 days had been in [[Saudi Arabia]] receiving medical treatment, was unable to formally empower the vice president to exercise full powers as acting president, as provided for in Section 145 of the country's constitution. No provision of the Nigerian constitution empowering the National Assembly to pass any such resolution, causing Senate President [[David Mark]] to assert that the Senate had been guided by the "doctrine of necessity" in arriving at its decision.

'''Downrange''' is the horizontal distance traveled by a [[spacecraft]], or the spacecraft's horizontal distance from the [[launch pad|launch site]].  More often, it is used as an adverb or adjective specifying the direction of that travel being measured in a horizontal direction.

In military slang, ''downrange'' is a term for being deployed overseas, usually in a war zone. It is also the name of a comic strip published in the newspaper [[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]].{{cn|date=March 2014}} It can also refer to the direction of fire: away from the source and in the direction of the target.

An '''edit conflict''' is a computer problem that may occur when multiple editors edit the same [[File (computer science)|file]] during a short time period. The problem is encountered on [[wiki]]s, distributed data systems, and [[revision control]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michael Antonovich (2010).
   [https://books.google.com/books?id=rSygoG-FhcAC&amp;pg=PA321 &lt;!--
   --&gt;''Office and SharePoint 2010 User's Guide: Integrating SharePoint''].
   p. 321 (752 pages), quote: "Edit conflict on a list linked to SharePoint".
&lt;/ref&gt; To save the file while minimizing edits, the conflict must be resolved.

== Description ==
An edit conflict is a computer problem that may occur when multiple editors edit the same [[File (computer science)|file]] during a short time period. The conflict occurs when an editor gets a copy of a shared document file, changes the copy, and attempts to save the changes to the original file, which has been altered another editor after the copy was obtained. To save the original file, the edit conflict must be resolved.

== Resolution ==
The simplest way to resolve an edit conflict is to ignore intervening edits and overwrite the current file. This may lead to a substantial loss of information, and alternative methods are often employed to resolve or prevent conflicts.
* Manual resolution, where the editor determines which version to retain and may manually incorporate edits into the current version of the file.
* Store [[Backup|backups]] or [[File comparison|file comparisons]] of each edit, so there are backups changes of the file once the original is overwritten
* [[File locking]], which limits the file to one editor at a time to prevent edit conflicts. Computer writer Gary B. Shelly notes that many [[wiki]] systems "will block the contributor who is attempting to edit the page from being able to do so until the contributor currently editing the page saves changes or remains idle on the page for an extended period of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WYSP0ll6ftcC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=%22Edit+conflict%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZQ_QTfvBJYKcsQOE0Yz9DA|title=Web 2.0: Concepts and Applications|last=Shelly|first=Gary B.|author2=Frydenberg, Mark|date=2010|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-1-4390-4802-3|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Merge (version control)|Merge]], by determining if the edits in unrelated parts of the file and combining without user intervention.

The problem is encountered on [[wiki]]s, distributed data systems (e.g., [[Google Sites]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heU9mQ4HovcC&amp;pg=PT114&amp;dq=%22Edit+conflict%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZQ_QTfvBJYKcsQOE0Yz9DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Edit%20conflict%22&amp;f=false|title=Google Sites &amp; Chrome for Dummies|last=Teeter|first=Ryan|author2=Barksdale, Karl|publisher=[[For Dummies]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-470-39678-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and  [[revision control system|revision control systems]] not using [[file locking]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The problem is more likely to occur when working on heavily edited articles on Wikipedia, such as those about a current event or a person suddenly in the news,&lt;ref name="Broughton"&gt;{{Cite book

{{Emotion}}
The study of the '''evolution of emotions''' dates back to the 19th century. [[Evolution]] and [[natural selection]] has been applied to the study of [[human communication]], mainly by [[Charles Darwin]] in his 1872 work, ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.&lt;ref name ="Darwin2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Darwin|first1= C.|title= The expression of the emotions in man and animals|year= 2007|origyear= 1872|publisher= Filiquarian|location= New York |isbn= 0-8014-1990-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Darwin researched the expression of [[emotion]]s in an effort to support his theory of evolution.  He proposed that much like other [[Phenotypic trait|trait]]s found in animals, emotions also evolved and were adapted over time.&lt;ref name="Hess"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hess|first1= U.|last2= Thibault|first2= P.|year= 2009|title= Darwin and Emotion Expression|journal= American Psychologist|volume= 64|issue= 2|pages= 120–8|pmid= 19203144 |doi= 10.1037/a0013386}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work looked at not only [[facial expression]]s in [[animals]] and specifically [[human]]s, but attempted to point out parallels between [[behavior]]s in humans and other animals.

According to modern evolutionary theory, different emotions evolved at different times. Primal emotions, such as fear, are associated with ancient parts of the brain and presumably evolved among our premammal ancestors. Filial emotions, such as a human mother's love for her offspring, seem to have evolved among early mammals. Social emotions, such as guilt and pride, evolved among social primates. Sometimes, a more recently evolved part of the brain moderates an older part of the brain, such as when the cortex moderates the [[amygdala]]'s fear response. [[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] consider human emotions to be best adapted to the life our ancestors led in nomadic foraging bands.

==Origins==
Darwin's original plan was to include his findings about expression of emotions in a chapter of his work, ''[[The Descent of Man|The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' (Darwin, 1871) but found that he had enough material for a whole book. It was based on [[observations]], both those around him and of people in many parts of the world. One important observation he made was that even in individuals who were born [[Blindness|blind]], body and facial expressions displayed are similar to those of anyone else. The ideas found in his book on [[universality (philosophy)|universality]] of emotions were intended to go against Sir [[Charles Bell|Charles Bell's]] 1844 claim&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bell|first1= C.|title= The anatomy and philosophy of expression as connected with the fine arts|edition= 3|year= 1844|publisher= John Murray|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; that human facial [[muscles]] were created to give them the unique ability to express emotions.&lt;ref name=Hess/&gt; The main purpose of Darwin's work was to support the theory of evolution by demonstrating that emotions in humans and other animals are similar. Most of the similarities he found were between [[species]] closely [[related]], but he found some similarities between distantly related species as well. He proposed the idea that emotional states are adaptive, and therefore only those able to express certain emotions passed on their characteristics.&lt;ref name=Darwin2/&gt;

===Darwin's principles===
In the 1872 work, Darwin proposed three principles. The first of the three is the "principle of serviceable habits," which he defined as useful habits reinforced previously, and then inherited by offspring. He used as an example contracting of eyebrows (furrowing the brow), which he noted is serviceable to prevent too much light from entering the eyes. He also said that the raising of eyebrows serves to increase the [[field of vision]]. He cited examples of people attempting to remember something and raising their brows, as though they could "see" what they were trying to remember.

The second of the principles is that of [[antithesis]]. While some habits are serviceable, Darwin proposed that some actions or habits are carried out merely because they are opposite in nature to a serviceable habit, but are not serviceable themselves. Shrugging of the shoulders is an example Darwin used of antithesis, because it has no service. Shoulder shrugging is a passive expression, and very opposite of a confident or aggressive expression.&lt;ref name=Darwin2/&gt;

The third of the principles is expressive habits, or nervous discharge from the nervous system. This principle proposes that some habits are performed because of a build-up to the [[nervous system]], which causes a [[:wikt:discharge|discharge]] of the [[Psychomotor agitation|excitement]]. Examples include foot and finger tapping, as well as vocal expressions and expressions of [[anger]]. Darwin noted that many animals rarely make noises, even when in [[pain]], but under extreme circumstances they vocalize in response to pain and [[fear]].&lt;ref name=Darwin2/&gt;

==Research==
{{See also|Emotion in animals}}
[[Paul Ekman]] is most noted in this field for conducting research involving facial expressions of emotions. His work provided data to back up Darwin's ideas about universality of facial expressions, even across cultures. He conducted research by showing photographs exhibiting expressions of basic emotion to people and asking them to identify what emotion was being expressed. In 1971, Ekman and Wallace Friesen presented to people in a preliterate culture a story involving a certain emotion, along with photographs of specific facial expressions. The photographs had been previously used in studies using subjects from [[Western cultures]]. When asked to choose, from two or three photographs, the emotion being expressed in the story, the preliterate subjects' choices matched those of the Western subjects most of the time. These results indicated that certain expressions are universally associated with particular emotions, even in instances in which the people had little or no exposure to Western culture. The only emotions the preliterate people found hard to distinguish between were fear and [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]].&lt;ref name="Friesen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ekman|first1= P|last2= Friesen|first2= W|year= 1971|title= Constants across cultures in the face and emotion|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 17|issue= 2|pages=124–9 |url=http://www.ekmaninternational.com/ResearchFiles/Constants-Across-Cultures-In-The-Face-And-Emotion.pdf|pmid= 5542557 |doi= 10.1037/h0030377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ekman noted that while universal expressions do not necessarily prove Darwin's theory that they evolved, they do provide strong evidence of the possibility.&lt;ref name="Ekman 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ekman|first1= P.|year= 1993|title= Facial expression and emotion|journal= American Psychologist|volume= 48|issue= 4|pages= 384–92|url=http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/_private/gradsoc_articles/facial%20expressions/Ekman%201993%20Am%20psych.pdf|pmid= 8512154 |doi= 10.1037/0003-066X.48.4.384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned the similarities between human expressions and those of other [[primates]], as well as an overall universality of certain expressions to back up Darwin's ideas. The expressions of emotion that Ekman noted as most universal based on research are: anger, fear, [[disgust]], [[sadness]], and [[enjoyment]].&lt;ref name="Ekman 1993"/&gt;

A common view is that facial expressions initially served a non-communicative [[adaptive]] function. Thus, the widened eyes in the facial expression of [[fear]] have been shown to increase the visual field and the speed of moving the eyes which helps finding and following threats. The wrinkled nose and mouth of the facial expression of [[disgust]] limit the intake of foul-smelling and possibly dangerous air and particles. Later, such reactions, which could be observed by other members of the group, increasingly become more distinctive and exaggerated in order to fulfill a primarily socially communicative function. This communicative function can dramatically or subtly influence the behavior of other members in the group. Thus, rhesus monkeys or human infants can learn to fear potential dangers based on only the facial expressions of fear of other group members or parents. Seeing fear expressions increases the tendency for flight responses while seeing anger expressions increases the tendency for fight responses. [[Classical conditioning]] studies have found that it is easier to create a pairing between a negative stimulant and anger/fear expressions than between a negative stimulant and a happiness expression. Cross-cultural studies and studies on the congenitally [[Blindness|blind]] have found that these groups display the same expressions of shame and pride in situations related to social status. These expressions have clear similarities to displays of submission and dominance by other primates. Humans viewing expression of pride automatically assign a higher social status to such individuals than to those expressing other emotions.&lt;ref name=Shariff2011/&gt;

[[Robert Zajonc]], a University of Michigan psychologist, published two reviews in 1989 of the "facial efference theory of emotion", also known as [[facial feedback hypothesis|facial feedback theory]],&lt;ref name="Adelmann "&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adelmann |first1 = P.

The theory is based on the idea that increasing the temperature of portions of the hypothalamus can produce aggressive behavior, whereas cooling can produce relaxation.  Our emotional language has comparable descriptors, such as "hot-head" and "cool-breezy".  The theory offers an explanation for the evolution of common facial expressions of emotion in mammals.  Little experimental work has been done to extend the theory, however.

[[Carroll Izard]], a [[psychologist]] who is known for his work with emotions, discussed gains and losses associated with the evolution of emotions. He said that discrete emotion experiences emerge in ontogeny before language or conceptual structures that frame the qualia known as discrete emotion feelings are acquired. He noted that in evolution, when humans gained the [[wikt:capability|capability]] of expressing themselves with [[language]], which contributed greatly to emotional evolution. Not only can humans [[:wikt:articulate|articulate]] and share their emotions, they can use their experiences to foresee and take appropriate action in future experiences. He did, however, raise the question of whether or not humans have lost some of their [[empathy]] for one another, citing things such as murder and crime against one another as destructive.&lt;ref name="Izard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Izard|first1= C.|year= 2009|title= Emotion Theory and Research: Highlights, Unanswered Questions, and Emerging Issues|journal= Annual Review of Psychology|volume= 60|issue= 1|pages= 1–25|pmid= 18729725 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163539 |pmc= 2723854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph LeDoux]] focuses much of his research on the emotion fear. Fear can be evoked by two systems in the [[brain]], both involving the [[thalamus]] and the [[amygdala]]: one old, short and fast, the other more recently evolved, more circuitous and slower. In the older system, sensory information travels directly and quickly from the thalamus to the amygdala where it elicits the autonomic and motor responses we call fear. In the younger system, sensory information travels from the thalamus to the relevant cortical sensory areas (touch to the somatosensory cortex, vision to the visual cortex, etc.) and on to frontal association areas, where appraisal occurs. These frontal areas communicate directly with the amygdala and, in light of appraisal, may reduce or magnify the amygdala's fear response. If you glimpse what looks like a snake, long before your younger frontal areas have had time to determine it is a stick, the old thalamus-amygdala system will have evoked fear. LeDoux hypothesizes that the old fast system persists because a behavioral response at the first hint of danger is of little consequence when mistaken but may mean the difference between life and death when appropriate.&lt;ref name= LeDoux1998&gt;{{cite book |last1= LeDoux|first1= J|editor1-first= JM|editor1-last= Jenkins|editor2-first= K|editor2-last= Oatley|editor3-first= NL|editor3-last= Stein|title= Human Emotions: A reader|edition= |year= 1998|publisher= [[Blackwell Publishers]]|location= Malden, Massachusetts|isbn= 0-631-20747-3|pages=98–111 |chapter= The emotional brain|chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kB19aJKJLoEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=the+emotional+brain+the+mysterious&amp;ots=trmA2l5D2r&amp;sig=XW8_YPeQTeUTz6wxPbbx1MxgAmM#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20emotional%20brain%20the%20mysterious&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LeDoux1996&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ledoux|first1= J.|year= 1996|title= Emotion Theory and Research: Highlights, Unanswered Questions, and Emerging Issues|journal= Annual Review of Psychology|volume= 60|issue= 1|pages= 1–25|pmid=18729725|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163539|pmc=2723854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be used to examine [[heterogeneity#Statistics|heterogeneity]] in a [[meta-analysis]], as an alternative or supplement to a [[forest plot]].

A Galbraith plot is produced by first calculating the standardized estimates or ''z''-statistics by dividing each estimate by its [[standard error]] (SE). The Galbraith plot is then a [[scatter plot]] of each ''z''-statistic (vertical axis) against 1/SE (horizontal axis). Larger studies (with smaller SE and larger 1/SE) will be observed to aggregate away from the origin.&lt;ref name="york"&gt;[http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/msc/systrev/week7/het_text.pdf University of York, Department of Health sciences MSc course material]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28594">'''Holism in science''', or '''holistic science''', is an approach to [[research]] that emphasizes the study of [[complex systems]]. Systems are approached as coherent wholes whose component parts are best understood in context and in relation to one another and to the whole. This practice is in contrast to a purely analytic tradition (sometimes called [[Reductionist science|reductionism]]) which aims to gain understanding of systems by dividing them into smaller composing elements and gaining understanding of the system through understanding their elemental properties.&lt;ref name="Alan2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Alan|authorlink=Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|title=Unity Of Nature, The: Wholeness And Disintegration In Ecology And Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Oy3CgAAQBAJ|date=4 October 2002|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-1-78326-116-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holism-reductionism dichotomy is often evident in conflicting interpretations of experimental findings and in setting priorities for future research.

== Overview ==

[[David Deutsch]] calls holism anti-reductionist and refers to the concept as thinking the only legitimate way to think about science is as a series of emergent, or higher level phenomena. He argues that neither approach is purely correct.&lt;ref name="Deutsch2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Deutsch|title=The Fabric of Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7uFxViR19oC|date=14 April 2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-196961-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two aspects of Holism are:

# The way of doing science, sometimes called "whole to parts", which focuses on observation of the specimen within its ecosystem first before breaking down to study any part of the specimen.&lt;ref name="Winther pp. 397–427"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Winther | first=Rasmus Grønfeldt | title=Part-whole science | journal=Synthese | volume=178 | issue=3 | date=29 September 2009 | issn=0039-7857 | doi=10.1007/s11229-009-9647-0 | pages=397–427}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The idea that the scientist is not a passive observer of an external universe but rather a participant in the system.&lt;ref name="Moreira-Munoz2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andres Moreira-Munoz|title=Plant Geography of Chile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hmH11ybGdQEC&amp;pg=PA283|date=19 January 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-481-8748-5|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holistic science is naturally suited to subjects such as ecology, biology, physics and the social sciences, where complex, non-linear interactions are the norm. These are systems where emergent properties arise at the level of the whole that cannot be predicted by focusing on the parts alone, which may make mainstream, reductionist science ill-equipped to provide understanding beyond a certain level. This principle of emergence in complex systems is often captured in the phrase ′the whole is greater than the sum of its parts′. Living organisms are an example: no knowledge of all the chemical and physical properties of matter can explain or predict the functioning of living organisms. The same happens in complex social human systems, where detailed understanding of individual behaviour cannot predict the behaviour of the group, which emerges at the level of the collective. The phenomenon of emergence may impose a theoretical limit on knowledge available through reductionist methodology, arguably making complex systems natural subjects for holistic approaches.&lt;ref name="Harding2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Harding|title=Animate Earth: Science, Intuition, and Gaia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEnxfXVwZtUC|date=15 September 2006|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|isbn=978-1-60358-149-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science journalist [[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] has expressed this view in the book ''The End of Science''. He wrote that a certain pervasive model within holistic science, [[self-organized criticality]], for example, "is not really a theory at all. Like [[punctuated equilibrium]], self-organized criticality is merely a description, one of many, of the random fluctuations, the noise, permeating nature." By the theorists' own admissions, he said, such a model "can generate neither specific predictions about nature nor meaningful insights. What good is it, then?"&lt;ref name="Horgan2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Horgan|title=The End Of Science: Facing The Limits Of Knowledge In The Twilight Of The Scientific Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQOCBgAAQBAJ|date=14 April 2015|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-05085-7|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the reasons that holistic science attracts supporters is that it seems to offer a progressive, 'socio-ecological' view of the world, but [[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Alan Marshall]]'s book ''The Unity of Nature'' offers evidence to the contrary; suggesting holism in science is not 'ecological' or 'socially-responsive' at all, but regressive and repressive.&lt;ref name="Alan2002"/&gt;

Richard Healey offered a modal interpretation and used it to present a model account of the puzzling correlations which portrays them as resulting from the operation of a process that violates both spatial and spatiotemporal separability. He argued that, on this interpretation, the nonseparability of the process is a consequence of physical property holism; and that the resulting account yields genuine understanding of how the correlations come about without any violation of relativity theory or Local Action.&lt;ref name="Healey1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Healey|title=The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics: An Interactive Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jc94Da5wmpcC|date=25 January 1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-40874-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work by Clifton, Dickson and Myrvold cast doubt on whether the account can be squared with relativity theory’s requirement of Lorentz invariance but leaves no doubt of an spatially entangled holism in the theory.&lt;ref name="DieksVermaas2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dennis Dieks|author2=Pieter E.

In the [[Holomovement|holistic approach]] of [[David Bohm]], any collection of quantum objects constitutes an indivisible whole within an [[Implicate and explicate order according to David Bohm|implicate and explicate order]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Healey: [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2009/entries/physics-holism/#OHQM ''Holism and Nonseparability in Physics (Spring 2009 Edition)''], Edward N.

==== Chaos and complexity ====
{{See Also|Chaos theory}}

In the latter half of the 20th century, holism led to [[systems thinking]] and its derivatives. Systems in biology, psychology, or sociology are frequently so complex that their behavior is, or appears, "new" or "[[emergence|emergent]]": it cannot be deduced from the properties of the elements alone.&lt;ref name="Georgiou2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ion Georgiou|title=Thinking Through Systems Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKKYFyAYriIC&amp;pg=PA50|date=11 January 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-01638-7|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holism has thus been used as a catchword. This contributed to the resistance encountered by the scientific interpretation of holism, which insists that there are [[ontology|ontological]] reasons that prevent reductive models in principle from providing efficient algorithms for prediction of system behavior in certain classes of systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2O8yppqAmAC&amp;pg=PA130|publisher=PediaPress|page=130|id=GGKEY:A1QP852ZJ8E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific holism holds that the behavior of a system cannot be perfectly predicted, no matter how much data is available. Natural systems can produce surprisingly unexpected behavior, and it is suspected that behavior of such systems might be [[computational irreducibility|computationally irreducible]], which means it would not be possible to even approximate the system state without a full simulation of all the events occurring in the system. Key properties of the higher level behavior of certain classes of systems may be mediated by rare "surprises" in the behavior of their elements due to the principle of interconnectivity, thus evading predictions except by brute force simulation.&lt;ref name="Gatherer 2010 p=22"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gatherer | first=Derek | title=So what do we really mean when we say that systems biology is holistic? | journal=BMC Systems Biology | volume=4 | issue=1 | year=2010 | issn=1752-0509 | doi=10.1186/1752-0509-4-22 | pmid=20226033 | pmc=2850881 | page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ecology ====
{{See also|Holistic community|Ecology}}

[[John Muir]], a Scottish born early American conservationist, wrote "When we try to pick out anything by itself we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe".&lt;ref name="Gifford2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Gifford|title=Reconnecting with John Muir: Essays in Post-Pastoral Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WaK56qGVYIC|date=25 January 2010|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-3665-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, holistic thinking is often applied to ecology, combining biological, chemical, physical, economic, ethical, and political insights. The complexity grows with the area, so that it is necessary to reduce the characteristic of the view in other ways, for example to a specific time of duration.&lt;ref name="Looijen2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rick C. Looijen|title=Holism and Reductionism in Biology and Ecology: The Mutual Dependence of Higher and Lower Level Research Programmes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B03qCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR7|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-015-9560-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Medicine ====
{{See Also|Medicine}}

In [[primary care]] the term "holistic," has been used to describe approaches that take into account social considerations and other intuitive judgements.&lt;ref name="TudorHart2010"&gt;[[Julian Tudor Hart]] (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_6-NeAqcsC&amp;pg=PA258 ''The Political Economy of Health Care''] pp.106, 258&lt;/ref&gt; The term holism, and so-called approaches, appear in [[psychosomatic illness|psychosomatic]] medicine in the 1970s, when they were considered one possible way to conceptualize psychosomatic phenomena. Instead of charting one-way causal links from [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] to [[Soma (biology)|soma]], or vice versa, it aimed at a systemic model, where multiple biological, psychological and social factors were seen as interlinked.&lt;ref name="context"/&gt;

Other, alternative approaches in the 1970s were psychosomatic and somatopsychic approaches, which concentrated on causal links only from psyche to soma, or from soma to psyche, respectively. At present it is commonplace in psychosomatic medicine to state that psyche and soma cannot really be separated for practical or theoretical purposes.&lt;ref name="context"&gt;{{cite book |title=Context | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=l2O8yppqAmAC&amp;pg=PA135|publisher=PediaPress |page=135|id=GGKEY:A1QP852ZJ8E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Systems medicine|systems medicine]] first appeared in 1992 and takes an integrative approach to all of the body and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Federoff |first1= Howard| last2= Gostin|first2= Lawrence O.| url= http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=184479 |title=Evolving from Reductionism to Holism: Is There a Future for Systems Medicine?| journal= Journal of the American Medical Association|volume= 302|issue=9 |year=2009| pages=994–996 | doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1264 | pmid=19724047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Federoff Gostin p=994"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Federoff | first=Howard J. | last2=Gostin | first2=Lawrence O. | title=Evolving From Reductionism to Holism | journal=JAMA | volume=302 | issue=9 | pages=994–6 | date=2 September 2009 | issn=0098-7484 | doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1264 | pmid=19724047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neurology ====
{{See Also|Neurology}}

A lively debate has run since the end of the 19th century regarding the functional organization of the [[brain]]. The holistic tradition (e.g., [[Pierre Marie]]) maintained that the brain was a homogeneous organ with no specific subparts whereas the localizationists (e.g., [[Paul Broca]]) argued that the brain was organized in functionally distinct [[cortical area]]s which were each specialized to process a given type of information or implement specific mental operations. The controversy was [[epitome|epitomized]] with the existence of a [[language]] area in the brain, nowadays known as the [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref&gt;'Does Broca's area exist?': Christofredo Jakob's 1906 response to Pierre Marie's holistic stance. Kyrana Tsapkini, Ana B. Vivas, Lazaros C. Triarhou. ''Brain and Language'', Volume 105, Issue 3, June 2008, Pages 211-219 {{DOI|10.1016/j.bandl.2007.07.124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Architecture ====
{{See Also|Architecture}}

Architecture is often argued by design academics and those practicing in design to be a holistic enterprise. Used in this context, holism tends to imply an all-inclusive design perspective. This trait is considered exclusive to architecture, distinct from other professions involved in design projects.&lt;ref name="Holm2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ivar Holm|title=Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial Design: How Attitudes, Orientations, and Underlying Assumptions Shape the Built Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gi7vcuGpAW8C|year=2006|publisher=Arkitektur- og designhøgskolen i Oslo|isbn=978-82-547-0174-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economics ====
{{See Also|Economics}}

Some economists use a causal holism theory in their work. That is they view the discipline in the manner of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and claim that it can't be defined by necessary and sufficient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boylan |first1=Thomas A. |last2=O'Gorman |first2=Pacal F. |title=Causal holism and economic methodology : theories, models and explanation |journal=Revue Internationale de Philosophie |date=2001 |pages=395 – 409 |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-internationale-de-philosophie-2001-3-page-395.htm |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Education reform ====
{{See Also|Education reform}}

The [[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives]] identifies many levels of cognitive functioning, which can be used to create a more [[holistic education]]. In [[authentic assessment]], rather than using computers to score multiple choice tests, a [[standards based assessment]] uses trained scorers to score open-response items using holistic scoring methods.&lt;ref&gt;Rubrics (Authentic Assessment Toolbox) "So, when might you use a holistic rubric? Holistic rubrics tend to be used when a quick or gross judgment needs to be made" [http://jonathan.mueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/rubrics.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In projects such as the North Carolina Writing Project, scorers are instructed not to count errors, or count numbers of points or supporting statements. The scorer is instead instructed to judge holistically whether "as a whole" is it more a "2" or a "3". Critics question whether such a process can be as objective as computer scoring, and the degree to which such scoring methods can result in different scores from different scorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Charney |first1=Davida |title=The Validity of Using Holistic Scoring to Evaluate Writing: A Critical Overview |journal=Research in the Teaching of English |date=February 1984 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=65 – 81 |url=https://www.la.utexas.edu/users/charney/homepage/Articles/Charney_HolisticScoring_1985.pdf |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anthropology ====
{{See Also|Anthropology}}

There is an ongoing dispute as to whether anthropology is intrinsically holistic. Supporters of this concept consider anthropology holistic in two senses. First, it is concerned with all human beings across times and places, and with all dimensions of humanity (evolutionary, biophysical, sociopolitical, economic, cultural, psychological, etc.)  Further, many academic programs following this approach take a "four-field" approach to anthropology that encompasses [[physical anthropology]], [[archeology]], [[linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]] or [[social anthropology]].&lt;ref name="SHORE 1999 pp. 5–6"&gt;{{cite journal | last=SHORE | first=BRADD | title=Strange Fate of Holism | journal=Anthropology News | volume=40 | issue=9 | year=1999 | issn=1541-6151 | doi=10.1111/an.1999.40.9.5 | pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some leading anthropologists disagree, and consider anthropological holism to be an artifact from 19th century [[sociocultural evolution|social evolutionary]] thought that inappropriately imposes scientific [[positivism]] upon cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name="SegalYanagisako2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel A. Segal|author2=Sylvia J. Yanagisako|title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle: Reflections on the Disciplining of Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dORVd0vwrA4C|date=14 April 2005|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-8684-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "holism" is additionally used within social and cultural anthropology to refer to an analysis of a society as a whole which refuses to break society into component parts. One definition says: "as a methodological ideal, holism implies ... that one does not permit oneself to believe that our own established institutional boundaries (e.g. between politics, sexuality, religion, economics) necessarily may be found also in foreign societies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of Anthropological Holism |url=http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/def/holism.htm |website=anthrobase.com |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Psychology of perception ====
{{See Also|Perception}}

A major holist movement in the early twentieth century was [[gestalt psychology]]. The claim was that perception is not an aggregation of atomic [[sense data]] but a field, in which there is a figure and a ground. Background has holistic effects on the perceived figure. Gestalt psychologists included [[Wolfgang Koehler]], [[Max Wertheimer]], [[Kurt Koffka]]. Koehler claimed the perceptual fields corresponded to electrical fields in the brain. [[Karl Lashley]] did experiments with gold foil pieces inserted in monkey brains purporting to show that such fields did not exist. However, many of the perceptual illusions and visual phenomena exhibited by the gestaltists were taken over (often without credit) by later perceptual psychologists. Gestalt psychology had influence on [[Fritz Perls]]' [[gestalt therapy]], although some old-line gestaltists opposed the association with counter-cultural and [[New Age]] trends later associated with gestalt therapy. Gestalt theory was also influential on phenomenology. [[Aron Gurwitsch]] wrote on the role of the field of consciousness in gestalt theory in relation to phenomenology. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] made much use of holistic psychologists such as work of [[Kurt Goldstein]] in his "Phenomenology of Perception."

==== Teleological psychology ====
{{See Also|Teleology}}

[[Alfred Adler]] believed that the individual (an integrated whole expressed through a self-consistent unity of thinking, feeling, and action, moving toward an unconscious, [[Classical Adlerian psychology#Fictional final goal|fictional final goal]]), must be understood within the larger wholes of society, from the groups to which he belongs (starting with his face-to-face relationships), to the larger whole of mankind. The recognition of our social embeddedness and the need for developing an interest in the welfare of others, as well as a respect for nature, is at the heart of Adler's philosophy of living and principles of psychotherapy.

[[Edgar Morin]], the French philosopher and sociologist, can be considered a holist based on the [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] nature of his work.

Mel Levine, M.D., author of ''A Mind at a Time'',&lt;ref&gt;(Simon &amp; Schuster, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder (with Charles R. Schwab) of the not-for-profit organization All Kinds of Minds, can be considered a holist based on his view of the 'whole child' as a product of many systems and his work supporting the educational needs of children through the management of a child's educational profile as a whole rather than isolated weaknesses in that profile.

== Skeptical reception ==

According to skeptics, the phrase "holistic science" is often misused by [[pseudoscience]]s. In the book ''Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology'' it's noted that "Proponents of pseudoscientific claims, especially in organic medicine, and mental health, often resort to the "mantra of holism" to explain away negative findings. When invoking the mantra, they typically maintain that scientific claims can be evaluated only within the context of broader claims and therefore cannot be evaluated in isolation."&lt;ref name="LilienfeldLynn2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scott O. Lilienfeld|author2=Steven Jay Lynn|author3=Jeffrey M. Lohr|title=Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q50gBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|date=12 October 2014|publisher=Guilford Publications|isbn=978-1-4625-1751-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an invocation of [[Karl Popper]]'s [[demarcation problem]] and in a posting to ''Ask a Philosopher'' [[Massimo Pigliucci]] clarifies Popper by positing, "Instead of thinking of science as making progress by inductive generalization (which doesn’t work because no matter how many times a given theory may have been confirmed thus far, it is always possible that new, contrary, data will emerge tomorrow), we should say that science makes progress by conclusively disconfirming theories that are, in fact, wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pigliucci |first1=Massimo |authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci|title=Demarcating science from pseudoscience |url=https://askaphilosopher.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/demarcating-science-from-pseudoscience/ |website=askaphilosopher.wordpress.com |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor J. Stenger]] states that "holistic healing is associated with the rejection of classical, Newtonian physics. Yet, holistic healing retains many ideas from eighteenth and nineteenth century physics. Its proponents are blissfully unaware that these ideas, especially superluminal holism, have been rejected by modern physics as well".&lt;ref name="Stenger2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor J. Stenger|title=Has Science Found God?: The Latest Results in the Search for Purpose in the Universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhE6ZXCFHZ0C&amp;pg=PA274|year=2003|publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=978-1-61592-158-4|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[quantum mysticism|quantum mystics]] interpret the wave function of quantum mechanics as a vibration in a holistic ether that pervades the universe and wave function collapse as the result of some cosmic consciousness. This is a misinterpretation of the effects of quantum entanglement as a violation of relativistic causality and quantum field theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Park |first1=Robert L. |authorlink=Robert L.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Hutchinson metric''' is a function which [[metric (mathematics)|measures]] "the discrepancy between two [[image]]s for use in [[fractal]] [[image processing]]" and "can also be applied to describe the similarity between [[DNA]] sequences expressed as real or complex [[genomic]] signals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drakopoulos |first=V. |last2=Nikolaou |first2=N. P. |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1355938 |title=Efficient computation of the Hutchinson metric between digitized images |journal=IEEE Transactions on Image Processing |volume=13 |issue=12 |date=December 2004 |doi=10.1109/tip.2004.837550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://isis.pub.ro/iafa2003/files/3-5.pdf Hutchinson Metric in Fractal DNA Analysis -- a Neural Network Approach] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818165407/http://isis.pub.ro/iafa2003/files/3-5.pdf |date=August 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definition==
Consider only nonempty, [[compact space|compact]], and finite [[metric space]]s. For a space &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;P(X) &lt;/math&gt; denote the space of Borel probability measures on &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt;, with 

:&lt;math&gt;\delta : X \rightarrow P(X) &lt;/math&gt; 

the embedding associating to &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; the point measure &lt;math&gt;\delta_x &lt;/math&gt;. The support &lt;math&gt;|\mu| &lt;/math&gt; of a measure  in P(X) is the smallest closed subset of measure 1. 

If 

:&lt;math&gt;f : X_1 \rightarrow X_2 &lt;/math&gt; 

is [[Borel measure|Borel measurable]] then the induced map 

:&lt;math&gt;f_* : P(X_1) \rightarrow P(X_2) &lt;/math&gt; 

associates to &lt;math&gt;\mu &lt;/math&gt; the measure &lt;math&gt; f_*(\mu) &lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;f_*(\mu)(B)= \mu(f^{-1}(B)) &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;B &lt;/math&gt; Borel in &lt;math&gt;X_2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Then the '''Hutchinson metric''' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;d(\mu_1,\mu_2)=\sup \left \lbrace \int u(x) \, \mu_1(dx) - \int u(x) \, \mu_2(dx) \right \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\sup&lt;/math&gt; is taken over all real-valued functions ''u'' with [[Lipschitz constant]]
&lt;math&gt;\le 1 \,.&lt;/math&gt;  

Then &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt;/math&gt; is an [[isometric embedding]] of &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;P(X) &lt;/math&gt;, and if 

:&lt;math&gt;f : X_1 \rightarrow X_2 &lt;/math&gt; 

is Lipschitz then 

:&lt;math&gt;f_* : P(X_1) \rightarrow P(X_2) &lt;/math&gt; 

is Lipschitz with the same Lipschitz constant.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/117923 "Invariant Measures for Set-Valued Dynamical Systems"] Walter Miller; Ethan Akin ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society'', Vol. 351, No. 3. (March 1999), pp. 1203–1225] &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''I'm Your Man''''' is a 1992 short film which was created to showcase [[Loews Theatres]]' [[interactive cinema]] technology. Audiences used seat-mounted joysticks to vote between three options in action at six different points throughout the movie.

==Production==
The movie was designed as the first test of [[Interfilm]], [[Bob Bejan]]'s interactive cinema company. The film was shot on 16mm Kodak film, transferred to [[laser disc]], and digitally projected to allow for nearly seamless transitions when audiences made their choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/14482|title=AMC Loews 19th Street East 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting and direction were less than impressive; the movie was shot over only 6 days, and Bejan did not require a second take of any shot.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=When the film audience controls the plot|publisher=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/13/movies/when-the-film-audience-controls-the-plot.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|date=January 13, 1993|first=William|last=Grimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In very early roles for both of them, comedy actors [[Michael Ian Black]] and [[Ben Garant]] appear as background in a party scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171392/fullcredits#writers|title=I'm Your Man - Full cast and crew|publisher=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
The film premiered in a special theater at the Loews on 19th Street and Broadway in New York City in December 1992.&lt;ref name=CHRON&gt;{{cite news|title=You make the movie/Interactive film allows audience to decide plot turns|date=December 18, 1992|publisher=Houston Chronicle|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1992_1100249/you-make-the-movie-interactive-film-allows-audienc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news|title=This movie requires a pistol grip|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=December 23, 1992|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-23/news/mn-2336_1_pistol-grip|first=Victor F.|last=Zonana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tickets to the 20-minute show were $3, and ticket holders were allowed to stay for as many viewings as they wanted.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Retrofitting an existing theater with the necessary voting equipment cost approximately $70,000.00, and 42 other theaters made the investment in 1993 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rutt Video &amp; Interactive|url=http://rutt.com/index.php?p=04e|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042618/http://rutt.com/index.php?p=04e|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film&amp;mdash;and the interactivity itself&amp;mdash;were well received by teens but dismissed by critics and adult moviegoers as being "as gimmicky as three-dimensional glasses or scratch 'n' sniff"&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; and "not like watching a real movie... more like rooting for a basketball team."&lt;ref name=James&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/movies/film-view-look-ma-i-m-an-auteur.html|title=Look, Ma, I'm an Auteur!|author=James, C.|date=February 7, 1993|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common criticism was that moviegoers would use the controls at vacant seats to vote more than once.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brpublicrelations.com/pdfs/interfilms/nytimes-audience_becomes.pdf|title=When the film audience controls the plot (pdf version of NYT article)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern was that the act of voting took moviegoers out of the story; it was thought that real-time interaction hampered the viewing experience, and engineers began working on an alternative technology that would let users customize movies ''before'' viewing began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orchestrating Digital Micromovies|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|author1=Davenport, G. |author2=Evans, R. |author3=Halliday, M. |url=http://mf.media.mit.edu/pubs/journal/OrchMicromovies.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the format ultimately failed due to lack of marketing and poor audience reception, ''I'm Your Man'' was released on DVD in 1998 as part of a second attempt at interactive video.&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/08/cyber/articles/17dvd.html|title=Interactive Filmmakers Hope to Make a Comeback|author=Napoli, L.|date=August 17, 1998|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], an '''index set''' is a set whose members label (or index) members of another set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric|title=Index Set|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/IndexSet.html|work=Wolfram MathWorld|publisher=Wolfram Research|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munkres|first=James R.|title=Topology|volume= 2|location=Upper Saddle River|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if the elements of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' may be ''indexed'' or ''labeled'' by means of the elements of a set ''J'', then ''J'' is an index set.  The indexing consists of a [[surjective function]] from ''J'' onto ''A'' and the indexed collection is typically called an ''[[indexed family|(indexed) family]]'', often written as {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''j''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Examples==

*An [[enumeration]] of a set {{math|''S''}} gives an index set &lt;math&gt;J \sub \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, where {{math|''f'' : ''J'' → ''S''}} is the particular enumeration of {{math|''S''}}.
*Any [[countably infinite]] set can be indexed by the set of [[natural numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.
*For &lt;math&gt;r \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[indicator function]] on {{math|''r''}} is the function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_r\colon \mathbb{R} \rarr \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_r (x) := \begin{cases} 0, &amp; \mbox{if }  x \ne r  \\ 1,  &amp; \mbox{if } x = r. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

The set of all the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_r&lt;/math&gt; functions &lt;!--(which happens to be a [[basis]] for the [[vector space]] of all functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;)--&gt; is an [[uncountable set]] indexed by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Other uses==
In [[computational complexity theory]] and [[cryptography]], an index set is a set for which there exists an algorithm &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; that can sample the set efficiently; e.g., on input &lt;math&gt;1^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; can efficiently select a poly(n)-bit long element from the set.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Infinity Walk''' is a therapeutic method for progressively developing coordination. It is typically usedin those with brain injuries or learning disabilities.

A beginning student or patient learns to walk smoothly in a figure-eight pattern while looking at an object or person across the room.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_HGDNdq8E0 This video] shows a simple infinity walk.&lt;/ref&gt; As they become able to do that consistently, other physical and mental activities are added to the coordinated walking. An advanced walker can maintain a smooth figure-eight walk while doing several other activities, ''e.g.,'' simultaneously gesturing and doing mental arithmetic as they converse with their teacher or therapist.

Developed in the 1980s by clinical psychologist Deborah Sunbeck. It strives to improve the sensorimotor functioning of those who practice it.&lt;ref name='Sunbeck1996'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sunbeck | first1 = Deborah | title = Infinity Walk: Preparing your mind to learn! | publisher = Jalmar Press | year = 1996 | location = Torrance, California | isbn = 1-880396-31-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In developing the method, Sunbeck also applied knowledge of [[social facilitation]] and [[intrinsic motivation]] to the task of creating a self-motivating method of physical and mental skill-building that would help the user develop resilient [[self-regulated learning]] strategies for future challenges.&lt;ref name='Sunbeck2002'&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Sunbeck | first1 = Deborah | title = The Complete Infinity Walk, Book 1: The Physical Self | publisher = The Leonardo Foundation Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-9705164-6-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17399">'''Institutional complementarity''' refers to situations of interdependence among [[institutions]]. This concept is frequently used to explain the degree of institutional diversity that can be observed across and within [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] systems, and its consequences on economic performance. In particular, the concept of institutional complementarity has been used to illustrate why institutions are resistant to change and why introducing new institutions into a system often leads to unintended, sometimes suboptimal, consequences.&lt;ref name="Gagliardi"&gt;Gagliardi, F. (2014). A Bibliometric Analysis of the Literature on Institutional Complementarities, ''Mimeo''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaches, based on the concept of institutional complementarities, have found applications across a wide range of institutional spheres, going from firm governance and industrial relations to varieties of capitalism and political reforms. Formal models have also been developed to study the nature and consequences of institutional complementarity. After a brief description of the canonical formal representation of institutional complementarity, the most relevant domains of applications will be discussed.

==Models of institutional complementarity==
The concept of institutional complementarity has deep roots in the social sciences.&lt;ref name="Lachmann"&gt;Lachmann, L.M. (1979), The legacy of Max Weber, Heinemann, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the sociological approach of the interdependence of different institutions has left the actions of the individuals largely outside the analysis, the modern approach, developed mainly by economists, has been based on the analysis of the constraints facing the actions of the individuals acting in different domains of choice. This approach has found applications across a wide range of institutional spheres, going from firm governance and industrial relations to varieties of capitalism and political reforms. Formal models have also been developed to study the nature and consequences of institutional complementarity.

The canonical model of institutional complementarity is due to [[Masahiko Aoki]]&lt;ref name="Aoki"&gt;Aoki, M. (2001), Towards a comparative institutional analysis, MIT Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; and relies on the theory of supermodular games developed by [[Paul Milgrom]] and [[John Roberts]].&lt;ref name="MIlgromRoberts"&gt;Milgrom P, Roberts J (1990) Rationalizability, lerning and equilibrium in games with strategic complementarities. Econometrica 58(6): 1255–1277.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic structure of the model takes the following form.

Let us consider a setting with two institutional domains, {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, and two sets of agents, {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''D''}} that do not directly interact with each other. Nevertheless, an institution implemented in one domain parametrically affects the consequences of the actions taken in the other domain. For instance, {{math|''A''}} can be associated with the type of ownership structure prevailing in a given country and {{math|''B''}} with the structure of labour rights. For simplicity we assume that the technological and natural environment is constant.

Suppose that the agents in domain {{math|''A''}} can choose a rule from two alternative options: {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}; similarly, agents in domain {{math|''B''}} can choose a rule from either {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} or {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. For simplicity, let us assume that all agents in each domain have an identical payoff function {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''u''(''i'' ∈ ''C'')}} or {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''v''(''j'' ∈ ''D'')}} defined on binary choice sets of their own, either  {{math|&amp;#123;''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#125;}}  or {{math|&amp;#123;''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#125;}}, with another sets as the set of parameters. We say that an (endogenous) “rule” is institutionalized in a domain when it is implemented as an equilibrium choice of agents in the relevant domains.

Suppose that the following conditions hold:
: &lt;math&gt; u(A^1; B^1) - u(A^2; B^1) \geq u(A^1; B^2) - u(A^2; B^2) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; u(B^2; A^2) - u(B^1; A^2) \geq u(B^2; A^1) - u(B^1; A^1) &lt;/math&gt;

for all {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}}. The latter are the so-called [[supermodular]] (complementarity) conditions. The first condition implies that the “incremental” benefit for the agents in {{math|''A''}} from choosing {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} rather than {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} increases as their institutional environment in  {{math|''B''}} is {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}  rather than {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} . The second condition implies that the incremental benefit for agents in {{math|''B''}}  from choosing {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}  rather than {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}  increases if their institutional environment in {{math|''A''}}  is {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}  rather than {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Note that these conditions are concerned with the property of incremental payoffs with respect to a change in a parameter value. They do not exclude the possibility that the level of payoff of one rule is strictly higher than that of the other for the agents of one or both domain(s) regardless of the choice of rule in the other domain. In such a case the preferred rule(s) will be implemented autonomously in the relevant domain, while the agents in the other domain will choose the rule that maximizes their payoffs in response to their institutional environment. Then the equilibrium of the system comprising {{math|''A''}}  and {{math|''B''}} – and thus the institutional arrangement across them – is uniquely determined by preference (technology).

However, there can also be cases in which neither rule dominates the other in either domain in the sense described above. If so, the agents in both domains need to take into account which rule is institutionalized in the other domain. Under the supermodularity condition there can then be two pure [[Nash equilibria]] (institutional arrangements) for the system comprising {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, namely {{math|(''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|(''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. When such multiple equilibria exist, we say that {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, as well as {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, are “institutional complements”.

If institutional complementarity exists, each institutional arrangement characterizes as a self-sustaining equilibrium where no agent has an inventive to deviate. It terms of welfare, it may be the case that possible overall institutional arrangements are not mutually Pareto comparable, or that one of them could be even Pareto suboptimal to the other. In these cases history is the main force determining which type of institutional arrangements is likely to emerge, with the consequence that suboptimal outcomes are possible.

Suppose for instance that {{math|(''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is a Pareto-superior institutional arrangement in which {{math|''u''(''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; ''u''(''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|''v''(''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; ''v''(''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} . However, for some historical reason {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is chosen in domain {{math|''A''}} and becomes an institutional environment for domain {{math|''B''}}. Faced with this institutional environment agents in domain {{math|''B''}} will correspondingly react by choosing reason {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Thus the Pareto-suboptimal institutional arrangement {{math|(''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} will result. This is an instance of coordination failure in the presence of indivisibility.

Obviously, there can also be cases where {{math|''u''(''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; ''u''(''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} but {{math|''v''(''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; ''v''(''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. This is an instance where the two viable institutional arrangements cannot be Pareto ranked. Agents exhibit conflicting interests in the two equilibria and the emergence of one institutional arrangement as opposed to the other may depend on the distribution of decisional power. If for some reasons agents choosing in domain A have the power to select and enforce their preferred rule, arrangement {{math|(''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is the most likely outcome. Alternatively, agents choosing in domain B will force the society to adopt {{math|(''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

==Applications==
[[Ugo Pagano]] and [[Robert Rowthorn]] &lt;ref name="Pagano92"&gt;Pagano U (1992) Organizational equilibria and production efficiency. Metroeconomica 43: 227–246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PaganoRowthorn"&gt;Pagano U, Rowthorn R (1994) Ownership, technology and institutional stability. Structural Change and Economic Dynamics 5(2): 221–242.&lt;/ref&gt;  present one of the earliest analytical contribution to institutional complementarity. In their models the technological choices take as parameters property rights arrangements whereas the latter are made on the basis of given technologies. The complementarities of technologies and property rights create two different sets of [[organizational equilibria]]. For instance, strong rights of the capital owners and a technology with a high intensity of specific and difficult to monitor capital are likely be institutional complements and define one possible organizational equilibrium. However, also strong workers' rights and a technology characterized by a high intensity of highly specific labor can be institutional complements and define an alternative organizational equilibrium. The organizational equilibria approach integrate the approach of [[Oliver Williamson]],&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;Williamson O E (1985) The economic institutions of capitalism. The Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; which have pointed out the influence of technology on rights and safeguards, and the views of the Radical Economists,&lt;ref name="Braverman"&gt;Braverman H (1974) Labor and monopoly capital: The degradation of work in the twentieth century. Monthly Review Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt; who have stressed the opposite direction of causation. The complementarities existing in the different organizational equilibria integrate both directions of causation in a single analytical framework. A similar approach has been used to explain organizational diversity in knowledge-intensive industries, such as software.&lt;ref name="Landini12"&gt;Landini F (2012) Technology, property rights and organizational diversity in the software industry. Structural Change and Economic Dynamics 23(2): 137-150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Landini13"&gt;Landini F (2013) Institutional change and information production. Journal of Institutional Economics 9(3): 257-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional complementarities characterize also the relations between intellectual property and human capital investments. Firms owning much [[intellectual property]] enjoy a protection for their investments in [[human capital]], which in turn favor the acquisition of additional intellectual property. By contrast other firms may find themselves in a vicious circle where the lack of intellectual property inhibits the incentive to invest in human capital and low levels of human capital investments involve that little or no intellectual property is ever acquired.&lt;ref name="PaganoRossi"&gt;Pagano U, Rossi M. A. (2004) Incomplete contracts, intellectual property and institutional complementarities. European Journal of Law and Economics 18(1): 55–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less formal approaches to institutional complementarities have also been adopted. In their seminal contribution Peter A. Hall and [[David Soskice]]&lt;ref name="HallSoskice"&gt;Hall P A, Soskice D (2001) Varieties of capitalism: The institutional foundations of comparative advantage. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; develop a broad theoretical framework to study the institutional complementarities that characterize different [[Varieties of Capitalism]]. Having a specific focus on the institutions of the political economy the authors develop an actor-centered approach for understanding the institutional similarities and differences among the developed economies. The varieties of capitalism approach has inspired a large number of application to the political economy field. To give some examples, Robert Franzese&lt;ref name="Franzese"&gt;Franzese R J (2001) Institutional and sectoral interactions in monetary policy and wage/price-bargaining. In: Hall P A, Soskice D (eds.) Varieties of capitalism: The institutional foundations of comparative advantage.

Gingerich  &lt;ref name="HallGingerich"&gt;Hall P A, Gingerich D W (2009) Varieties of capitalism and institutional complementarities in the political economy: An empirical analysis.

Review of International Political Economy 7(4): 645-687.&lt;/ref&gt;  analyzes the implications of institutional complementarity for social systems of innovation and production.

In addition to institutional variety, the notion of institutional complementarity has also motivated studies on institutional change.&lt;ref name="HallThelen"&gt;Hall P A, Thelen K (2009) Institutional change in varieties of capitalism. Socio-Economic Review 7(1): 7-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer"&gt;Boyer R (2005) Coherence, diversity, and the evolution of capitalisms: The institutional complementarity hypothesis. Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review 2(1): 43-80.&lt;/ref&gt; In these works institutional complementarity is often presented as a conservative factor, which increases the stability of the institutional equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Pagano11"&gt;Pagano U (2011) Interlocking complementarities and institutional change. Journal of Institutional Economics 7(3): 373–392.&lt;/ref&gt; In presence of institutional complementarity change requires the simultaneous variation of different institutional domains, which in turn demands high coordination among the actors involved. Sometime, institutions themselves can act as resources for new courses of action that (incrementally) favor change.&lt;ref name="DeegJackson"&gt;Deeg R, Jackson G (2007) Towards a more dynamic theory of capitalist variety. Socio-Economic Review 5(1): 149-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside contributions on the distinct models of capitalism, the concept institutional complementarity has found application also in other domain of analysis. [[Masahiko Aoki]],&lt;ref name="Aoki94"&gt;Aoki M (1994) The contingent governance of teams: Analysis of institutional complementarity. International Economic Review 35(3): 657-676.&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, studies the role of institutional complementarity in contingent governance models of teams.

Francesca Gagliardi &lt;ref name="Gagliardi09"&gt;Gagliardi F (2009) Financial development and the growth of cooperative firms. Small Business Economics 32(4): 439-464.&lt;/ref&gt; argue in favor of an institutional complementarity relationship between local banking institutions and [[cooperative]] firms in Italy. Andrea Bonaccorsi and Grid Thoma,&lt;ref name="BonaccorsiThuma"&gt;Bonaccorsi A, Thoma G (2007) Institutional complementarity and inventive performance in nano science and technology. Research Policy 36(6): 813-831.&lt;/ref&gt; finally, uses the idea of institutional complementarity to investigate inventive performance in [[nano science]] and technology.

'''Irish measure''' or '''plantation measure''' was a system of units of [[land measurement]] used in Ireland from the [[Plantations of Ireland|16th century plantations]] until the 19th century, with residual use into the 20th century. The units were based on "[[English units|English measure]]" but used a [[linear perch]] measuring {{convert|7|yard|m}} as opposed to the English [[Rod (unit)|rod]] of {{convert|5.5|yard|m}}. Thus, linear units such as the [[furlong]] and [[mile]], which were defined in terms of perches, were longer by a factor of 14:11 (~27% more) in Irish measure, while areas such as the [[Rood (measurement)|rood]] or [[acre]] were larger by 196:121 (~62% more).  After the [[Act of Union 1800]], Ireland was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], whose Parliament passed the [[Weights and Measures Act 1824]], which established English measure in Ireland as "[[British Empire|Imperial]] measure" or "statute measure". Imperial measure soon replaced Irish measure in the use of the [[Dublin Castle administration]], but Irish measure persisted in local government, and longer still in private use.

In 1937, a man being prosecuted for driving outside the 15-mile limit of his licence offered the unsuccessful defence that, since Ireland was independent, the limit should be reckoned by Irish miles "just as no one would ever think of selling land other than as [[acre (Irish)|Irish acre]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1937/1127/Pg005.html#Ar00504 |title=Irish miles or English?

==Irish acre==
{{anchor|Acre}}&lt;!-- [[Irish acre]] and [[Acre (Irish)]] redirect here --&gt;
The '''Irish acre''' or '''plantation acre''' measured one Irish [[Chain (unit)|chain]] by one Irish furlong, or 4 Irish perches by 40, or 7840 square yards: approximately 0.66 [[hectare]]s or 1.62 [[statute acre]]s.&lt;ref name="sizesacre"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sizes.com/units/acre_irish.htm|title=What is an Irish acre?|work=Sizes.com|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lancashire acre around the [[Solway Firth]] and the Churchland acre in [[Yorkshire]] were the same size, which [[Frederic Seebohm (historian)|Frederic Seebohm]] in 1914 connected to the {{lang|cy|[[erw]]}} of [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]] in Wales.&lt;ref name="sizesacre" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924013859479 |title=Customary acres and their historical importance, being a series of unfinished essays |first1=Frederic |last1=Seebohm |first2=Seebohm |last2=Hugh Exton |date=1914 |publisher=Longman's, Green, &amp; co.  |accessdate=20 May 2015 |pages=Fig 16 (after p.100), pp.112, 266 |nopp=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]] from its 1824 foundation used statute acres in its maps, which were used in turn for [[Griffith's Valuation]] and the census.  The Irish acre remained common in Irish newspaper advertisements for farmland and other property until the middle of the 20th century.

In older [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] usage, a [[townland]] was notionally 60 or 120 "acres", but the size varied by the quality of the land. This unevenness was not sufficiently understood by English and Scottish planters, which caused disputes when confiscated land was divided and assigned.&lt;ref name="Bardon2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bardon|first=Jonathan|title=The Plantation of Ulster: War and Conflict in Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lN_4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT159|accessdate=15 May 2015|date=2011-11-14|publisher=Gill &amp; Macmillan|isbn=9780717151998|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Anglo-Norman Ireland]], as in England of the time, "acre" sometimes meant any individual plot of land; as a standard measure, it was probably about 2.5 statute acres near Dublin, perhaps differing elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Organization of Anglo-Irish Agriculture in the Middle Ages |first=J. |last=Otway-Ruthven |journal=The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland |volume=81 |number=1 |date=1951 |page=3 |publisher=Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland |jstor=25510758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The '' Advertisements for Ireland'' of 1623 stated that the Irish acre varied by region from 1.25 to 8 English acres, while the [[Civil Survey]] of 1654 said that Irish surveys had measured only arable land, ignoring pasture, wood, bog, or wasteland.&lt;ref name="Jäger2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jäger|first=Helmut|year=2016|title=Land Use in Medieval Ireland: A Review of the Documentary Evidence|journal=Irish Economic and Social History|volume=10|issue=1|pages=51–65 : 52–53 |issn=0332-4893|doi=10.1177/033248938301000104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of eleven townlands in Ireland named "Fortyacres" in 1901, six had areas between 60 and 78 statute acres; the smallest was 46 acres and the largest 185.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/PageBrowser?path=Browse/Census%20(by%20date)/1901/Ireland&amp;active=yes&amp;mno=453&amp;tocstate=expandnew&amp;display=sections&amp;display=tables&amp;display=pagetitles&amp;pageseq=474 |title=General topographical index of Ireland, 1901 |page=463 |series=[[Command paper]]s |volume=Cd.2071 |date=1904 |publisher=HMSO |location=Dublin |accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[civil parish (Ireland)|civil parish]] of Carn, [[County Wexford]] has townlands named Threeacres, Nineacres, and Nineteenacres, with respective areas of 12, 21, and 30 statute acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1901 Census of Ireland: Vol I, Leinster |series=Command papers|volume=Cd.847|chapter=Wexford|year=1902|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Dalanon was born on 1981 in [[Cebu City]] to Capt. Benjamin Dalanon Jr., a retired master mariner, and Mrs. Angelina Dalanon, a retired teacher. He is the eldest among four siblings. He spent his preschool days at the Sacred Heart School for Boys, elementary at the [[University of San Carlos]] Boys School, and was a scholar at the [[Cebu City National Science High School]].

He finished his dental degree in 2005 at the Southwestern University PHINMA. After passing the Professional Regulation Commission's licensure examination for dentists, he studied Nursing for Health Allied Professions for a year at the [[Cebu Normal University]] while undergoing a postgraduate training in orthodontics and temporomandibular joint dysfunction management at the Center for Advance Dental Studies in [[Quezon City|Quezon City, Philippines]]. He then took up and finished a certificate course in [[Professional education|Professional Education]] in 2008, Diploma in  [[Special education|Special Education]] in 2009, [[Master of Arts in Teaching]] Special Education in 2010, and [[Doctor of Education]] in [[Educational Management Administration &amp; Leadership|Educational Management]] in 2014.

== Academic and professional career ==
In 2014 he was invited by the dean of the school of dentistry and the chief of clinics of Southwestern University PHINMA to join the faculty. As a specialist in special needs dentistry, he frequently lectures for the Philippine Dental Association Cebu Chapter and the [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] Regional Office VII (DOH RO VII) for the Public Health Dentists of Bohol, Cebu, Negros Oriental and Siquijor.  One of these lectures was during the 1st Public Health Dental Congress in Central Visayas on June 14 and 15, 2016 at Sarrosa International Hotel and Residential Suites, Kasambagan, Cebu City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ro7.doh.gov.ph/links-2/22-press-release/274-1st-public-health-dental-congress-in-central-visayas|title=1st Public Health Dental Congress in Central Visayas|last=Villas|first=Edsel Roseus|date=July 18, 2016|website=Republic of the Philippines Department of Health - Regional Office VII|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 he became the youngest president of the Philippine Dental Association Cebu Chapter and subsequently the youngest to receive a national award as one of only 10, Philippine Dental Association's most outstanding chapter presidents. Together with then president of the National Association of Dental Traders, Inc., Mrs. Lourdes Villaroman, they organized the 1st Philipine Dental Exposition on July 28-29, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dentisty.org/the-1st-philippine-dental-exposition--nadti.html|title=The 1st philippine dental exposition – nadti|website=dentisty.org|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his term of office, he has been a frequent source of information regarding dental health in various radio and television programs like [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]]'s [[TV Patrol Central Visayas|TV Patrol]] and DYAB Cebu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=DYAB Cebu|title=DYAB Cebu Live Streaming (Saturday, February 27, 2016)|date=2016-02-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN2CQz6khHk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=898|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution''''' is a 5-volume work (1977–1990) about [[Karl Marx]] by [[Hal Draper]].

==Reception==
The economist [[Robert Heilbroner]] praised ''Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution'' as an "extraordinarily stimulating work written in a fresh, open style which comes as a welcome relief after the turgidities of so much Marxist writing."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fli90|Flint 1990]].&lt;/ref&gt; The political scientist [[David McLellan (political scientist)|David McLellan]] described it as a "splendidly detailed discussion aiming to show that Marx was always right."&lt;ref&gt;[[#McL95|McLellan 1995]]. p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skip|title=Escaping Conflict and the Drama Triangle|url=http://bpdfamily.com/content/karpman-drama-triangle|publisher=[[BPDFamily.com]]|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drama triangle model is a tool used in psychotherapy, specifically [[transactional analysis]].

==Origin==
The drama triangle is a [[social model]] that was conceived by Stephen Karpman, a student studying under [[Eric Berne]], the father of [[transactional analysis]]. Berne encouraged Karpman to publish what Berne referred to as ''"Karpman's triangle"''. Karpman's article was published in 1968. Karpman received the Eric Berne Memorial Scientific Award in 1972 for this work.

Through popular usage and the work of Karpman and others, Karpman's triangle has been adapted for use in structural analysis (''defining the conflict roles of persecutor, victim, and rescuer'') and transactional analysis (''diagramming how participants switch roles in conflict'').&lt;ref name=berneaward&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karpmen, MD|first1=Stephen|title=Eric Berne Memorial Scientific Award|url=http://www.karpmandramatriangle.com/pdf/AwardSpeech.pdf|website=karpmandramatriangle.com|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Karpman used triangles to map conflicted or drama-intense relationship transactions.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; The Karpman Drama Triangle models the connection between personal responsibility and power in conflicts, and the destructive and shifting roles people play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murdoch, B.Ed.|first1=Edna|title=The Karpman Drama Triangle|url=http://coachingsupervisionacademy.com/thought-leadership/the-karpman-drama-triangle/|website=Coaching Supervision Academy|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He defined three roles in the conflict; Persecutor, Rescuer (the one up positions) and Victim (one down position). Karpman placed these three roles on an inverted triangle and referred to them as being the three aspects, or faces of drama. Karpman, who had interests in acting and was a member of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], chose the term "drama triangle" rather than the term "conflict triangle" as the Victim in his model is not intended to represent an actual victim, but rather someone feeling or acting like a victim.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

# '''The Victim:''' The Victim's stance is ''"Poor me!"'' The Victim feels victimized, oppressed, helpless, hopeless, powerless, ashamed, and seems unable to make decisions, solve problems, take pleasure in life, or achieve insight. The Victim, if not being persecuted, will seek out a Persecutor and also a Rescuer who will save the day but also perpetuate the Victim's negative feelings.
# '''The Rescuer:'''  The rescuer's line is "Let me help you." A classic enabler, the Rescuer feels guilty if he/she doesn't go to the rescue. Yet his/her rescuing has negative effects: It keeps the Victim dependent and gives the Victim permission to fail. The rewards derived from this rescue role are that the focus is taken off of the rescuer. When he/she focuses their energy on someone else, it enables them to ignore their own anxiety and issues. This rescue role is also very pivotal because their actual primary interest is really an avoidance of their own problems disguised as concern for the victim’s needs.
# '''The Persecutor:''' (a.k.a. Villain) The Persecutor insists, ''"It's all your fault."'' The Persecutor is controlling, blaming, critical, oppressive, angry, authoritative, rigid, and superior.

Initially, a drama triangle arises when a person takes on the role of a victim or persecutor. This person then feels the need to enlist other players into the conflict. As often happens, a rescuer is encouraged to enter the situation.&lt;ref name=berne_hello&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berne, MD|first1=Eric|title=What Do You Say After You Say Hello?|date=1973|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=9780553232677|pages=186, 188, 307, 346}}&lt;/ref&gt; These enlisted players take on roles of their own that are not static, and therefore various scenarios can occur. For example, the victim might turn on the rescuer, the rescuer then switches to persecuting.

The motivations for each participant and the reason the situation endures is that each gets their unspoken (and frequently unconscious) psychological wishes/needs met in a manner they feel justified, without having to acknowledge the broader [[:wikt:dysfunction|dysfunction]] or harm done in the situation as a whole. As such, each participant is acting upon their own [[selfish]] needs, rather than acting in a genuinely responsible or [[altruistic]] manner.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Thus any character from all of three in this triangle might ''"ordinarily come on like a plaintive victim; it is now clear that the one can switch into the role of Persecutor providing it is 'accidental' and the one apologizes for it"''.&lt;ref name=berne_hello/&gt;

The motivations of the rescuer are the least obvious. In the terms of the drama triangle, the rescuer is someone who has a mixed or covert motive and is actually benefiting [[wikt:ego|egoically]] in some way from being "the one who rescues". The rescuer has a surface motive of resolving the problem and appears to make great efforts to solve it, but also has a hidden motive to not succeed, or to succeed in a way that they benefit. For example, they may get a self-esteem boost or receive respected rescue status, or derive enjoyment by having someone depend on them and trust them – and act in a way that ostensibly seems to be trying to help, but at a deeper level plays upon the victim in order to continue getting a payoff.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.

In some cases, the relationship between the victim and the rescuer can be one of [[codependency]]. The rescuer keeps the victim dependent on them by encouraging their victimhood. The victim gets their needs met by having the rescuer take care of them.

In general, participants tend to have a primary or habitual role (victim, rescuer, persecutor) when they enter into drama triangles. Participants first learn their habitual role in their family of origin. Even though participants each have a role with which they most identify, once on the triangle, participants rotate through all the positions, going completely around the triangle.&lt;ref name=forrest&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forrest, SW|first1=Lynne|title=The Three Faces of Victim — An Overview of the Drama Triangle|url=http://www.lynneforrest.com/articles/2008/06/the-faces-of-victim/|website=lynneforrest.com|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each triangle has a ''payoff'' for those playing it. The ''antithesis'' of a drama triangle lies in discovering how to deprive the actors of their payoff.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

==Historical context==

'''Family therapy movement.''' After World War II, therapists observed that while many battle-torn veteran patients readjusted well after returning to their families, some patients did not; some even regressed when they returned to their home environment. Researchers felt that they needed an explanation for this and began to explore the dynamics of family life – and thus began the family therapy movement. Prior to this time, psychiatrists and psychoanalysts focused on the patient’s already-developed psyche and downplayed outside detractors. Intrinsic factors were addressed and extrinsic reactions were considered as emanating from forces within the person.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

'''Transactions analysis.''' In the 1950s, Eric Berne, M.D. developed Transactional Analysis – a method for studying interactions between individuals. This approach was profoundly different than that of Freud. While Freud relied on asking patients about themselves, Berne felt that a therapist could learn by observing what was communicated (words, body language, facial expressions) in a transaction. So instead of directly asking the patient questions, Berne would frequently observe the patient in a group setting, noting all of the transactions that occurred between the patient and other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eric Berne Family|title=Transactional Analysis|url=http://www.ericberne.com/transactional-analysis/|website=Eric Berne, M.D.|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Triangles/triangulation.''' The theory of [[Triangulation (psychology)|triangulation]] was originally published in 1966 by [[Murray Bowen| Murray Bowen, M.D.]] as one of eight parts of Bowen's family systems theory.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Murray Bowen, M.D., a pioneer in family systems theory, began his early work with schizophrenics at the [[Menninger Foundation|Menninger Clinic]], from 1946 to 1954. Triangulation is the “process whereby a two-party relationship that is experiencing tension will naturally involve third parties to reduce tension”.&lt;ref name=Rabstejnek&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabstejnek, P.E., M.B.A., Ph.D.|first1=Carl V.|title=Family Systems &amp; Murray Bowen Theory|url=http://www.houd.info/bowenTheory.pdf|website=houd.info|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, when people find themselves in conflict with another person, they will reach out to a third person. The resulting triangle is more comfortable as it can hold much more tension because the tension is being shifted around three people instead of two.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

Bowen studied the [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] of the ''mother and her schizophrenic child'' while he had them both living in a research unit at the Menninger clinic. Bowen then moved to the [[National Institutes of Health|National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)]], where he resided from 1954 to 1959. At the NIMH Bowen extended his hypothesis to include the ''father-mother-child'' [[Triad (sociology)|triad]]. Bowen considered ''differentiation'' and ''triangles'' the crux of his theory, Bowen Family Systems Theory. Bowen intentionally used the word ''triangle'' rather than ''triad''. In Bowen Family Systems Theory, the triangle is an essential part of the relationship.

Couples left to their own resources oscillate between closeness and distance. Two people having this imbalance often have difficulty resolving it by themselves. To stabilize the relationship, the couple often seek the aid of a third party to help re-establish closeness. A triangle is the smallest possible relationship system that can restore balance in a time of stress. The third person assumes an outside position. In periods of stress, the outside position is the most comfortable and desired position. The inside position is plagued by anxiety, along with its emotional closeness. The outsider serves to preserve the inside couple’s relationship. Bowen noted that not all triangles are constructive – some are destructive.&lt;ref name=Rabstejnek/&gt;

'''Pathological/perverse triangles.''' In 1968, [[Nathan Ackerman| Nathan Ackerman, MD]] conceptualized a destructive triangle. Ackerman stated ''“we observe certain constellations of family interactions which we have epitomized as the pattern of family interdependence, roles those of destroyer or persecutor, the victim of the scapegoating attack, and the family healer or the family doctor.'' Ackerman also recognize the pattern of attack, defense, and counterattack, as shifting roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weeks, PhD|first1=Gerald R.|last2=L'Abate, PhD|first2=Luciano|title=Paradoxical Psychotherapy: Theory &amp; Practice With Individuals Couples &amp; Families|date=August 15, 2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781138009400|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karpman triangles.''' In 1968, Stephen Karpman, M.D. theorizes the Karpman Drama Triangle in an article titled  ''Fairy tales and script drama analysis''. Karpman was a recent graduate of [[Duke University School of Medicine]] and was doing post post-graduate studies under Eric Berne at the time.&lt;ref name=triangle&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karpman MD|first1=Stephen|title=Fairy tales and script drama analysis|journal=Transactional Analysis Bulletin|date=1968|volume=26|issue=7|pages=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transactional analysis==
{{main|Transactional analysis}}

Eric Berne, a Canadian-born psychiatrist, created the theory of transactional analysis, in the middle of the 20th century, as a way of explaining human behavior. Berne's theory of transactional analysis was based on the ideas of [[Freud]] but was distinctly different. Freudian psychotherapists focused on talk therapy as a way of gaining insight to their patients' personalities. Berne believed that insight could be better discovered by analyzing patients’ social transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transactional Analysis|url=http://www.disorders.org/transactional-analysis/|website=disorders.org|accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Games'' in transactional analysis refers to a series of transactions that is complementary (reciprocal), ulterior, and proceeds towards a predictable outcome. In this context, the Karpman Drama Triangle is a "game".

Games are often characterized by a switch in roles of players towards the end. The number of players may vary. Games in this sense are devices used (often [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]ly) by people to create a circumstance where they can justifiably feel certain resulting feelings (such as [[anger]] or superiority) or justifiably take or avoid taking certain actions where their own inner wishes differ from societal expectations. They are always a substitute for a more genuine and full adult emotion and response which would be more appropriate. Three quantitative variables are often useful to consider for games:
: '''Flexibility''': "The ability of the players to change the currency of the game (that is, the tools they use to play it). 'Some games...can be played properly with only one kind of currency, while others, such as exhibitionistic games, are more flexible",&lt;ref name=berne-games&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berne, M.D.|first1=Eric|title=Games People Play|date=1996|publisher=Ballantine Books|pages=45, 57|location=New York|isbn=978-0345410030}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that players may shift from words, to money, to parts of the body.
: '''Tenacity''': "Some people give up their games easily, others are more persistent", referring to the way people stick to their games and their resistance to breaking with them.
: '''Intensity''': "Some people play their games in a relaxed way, others are more tense and aggressive. Games so played are known as easy and hard games, respectively",&lt;ref name=berne-games/&gt; the latter being played in a tense and [[aggressive]] way.&lt;ref name="berne-games"/&gt;

The consequences of games may vary from small paybacks to paybacks built up over a long period to a major level. Based on the degree of acceptability and potential harm, games are classified into three categories, representing first degree games, second degree games, and third degree games:
* socially acceptable,
* undesirable but not irreversibly damaging 
* may result in drastic harm.&lt;ref name="berne-games"/&gt;

The Karpman triangle was an adaptation of a model that was originally conceived to analyze the [[play-action pass]] and the [[draw play]] in American football and later adapted as a way to analyze movie scripts. Karpman is reported to have doodled thirty or more diagram types before settling on the triangle. Karpman credits the movie ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' as being a [[testbed]] for refining the model into what Berne coined as the Karpman Drama Triangle.&lt;ref name=berneaward/&gt;

Karpman now has many variables of the Karpman triangle in his fully developed theory, besides role switches. These include space switches (private-public, open-closed, near-far) which precede, cause, or follow role switches, and script velocity (number of role switches in a given unit of time).&lt;ref name=berne_hello/&gt; These include the ''Question Mark triangle, False Perception triangle, Double Bind triangle, The Indecision triangle, the Vicious Cycle triangle, Trapping triangle, Escape triangle, Triangles of Oppression, and Triangles of Liberation, Switching in the triangle,'' and ''the Alcoholic Family triangle.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karpman, M.D.|first1=Stephen B.|title=The New Drama Triangles USATAA/ITAA Conference Lecture|url=http://karpmandramatriangle.com/pdf/thenewdramatriangles.pdf|website=karpmandramatriangle.com|accessdate=August 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While transactional analysis is the method for studying interactions between individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solomon Ph.D.|first1=Carol|title=Transactional Analysis|url=http://www.ericberne.com/transactional-analysis/|website=Eric Berne, MD|publisher=University of California at San Francisco|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; one researcher postulates that drama-based leaders can instill an organizational culture of drama. ''Persecutors'' are more likely to be in leadership positions and a ''prosecutor culture'' goes hand in hand with cutthroat competition, [[Culture of fear#In the workplace|fear]], blaming, manipulation, high [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] and an increased risk of lawsuits. There are also ''victim cultures'' which can lead to low morale and low [[Employee engagement|engagement]] as well as an [[Conflict avoidance#Conflict avoidance in the workplace|avoidance of conflict]], and ''rescuer cultures'' which can be characterized as having a high dependence on the leader, low initiative and low innovation.&lt;ref name="Regier2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nate Regier|title=Conflict without Casualties: A Field Guide for Leading with Compassionate Accountability|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ek75DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32|date=24 April 2017|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers|isbn=978-1-5230-8262-9|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapeutic models==
'''The Winner's Triangle''' was published by Acey Choy in 1990 as a therapeutic model for showing patients how to alter social transactions when entering a triangle at any of the three entry points. Choy recommends that anyone feeling like a victim think more in terms of being ''vulnerable and caring'', that anyone cast as a persecutor adopt an ''assertive'' posture, and anyone recruited to be a rescuer should react by being "caring".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Choy|first1=Acey|title=The Winner's Triangle|journal=Transactional Analysis Journal|date=1990|volume=20|issue=1|page=40|url=http://scribd.com/doc/52446575/TAJ-1990-Acey-Choy-The-winners-triangle-r#scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Vulnerable'' –  a victim should be encouraged to accept their vulnerability,  problem solve, and be more self-aware.
* ''Assertive'' – a persecutor should be encouraged to ask for what they want, be assertive, but not be punishing.
* ''Caring'' – a rescuer should be encouraged to show concern and be caring, but not over-reach and problem solve for others.

'''The Power of TED''', first published in 2009, recommends that the "victim" adopt the alternative role of ''creator'', view the persecutor as a ''challenger'', and enlist a ''coach'' instead of a rescuer.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Power of TED|last=Emerald|first=David|publisher=Polaris Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-09968718-0-8|edition=3rd|location=|pages=1–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Creator'' – victims are encouraged to be outcome-oriented as opposed to problem-oriented and take responsibility for choosing their response to life challenges. They should focus on resolving "dynamic tension" (the difference between current reality and the envisioned goal or outcome) by taking incremental steps toward the outcomes he or she is trying to achieve.
* ''Challenger'' – a victim is encouraged to see a persecutor as a person (or situation) that forces the creator to clarify his or her needs, and focus on their learning and growth.
* ''Coach'' – a rescuer should be encouraged to ask questions that are intended to help the individual to make informed choices. The key difference between a rescuer and a coach is that the coach sees the creator as capable of making choices and of solving his or her own problems. A coach asks questions that enable the creator to see the possibilities for positive action, and to focus on what he or she does want instead of what he or she does not want.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

'''Legislation''' (or "[[statutory law]]") is law which has been [[promulgation|promulgated]] (or "[[enactment of a bill|enacted]]") by a [[legislature]] or other [[Government|governing body]] or the process of making it.&lt;ref&gt;See Article 289(3) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]&lt;/ref&gt; Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]], and may be broadly referred to as "legislation", while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare or to restrict. It may be contrasted with a non-legislative act which is adopted by an [[Executive (government)|executive]] or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act or for implementing a legislative act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is the European Legislator after Lisbon a real Legislature?  |author=Wim Voermans |journal=Legislacao Cadernos de Ciencia de Legislacao |volume=50 |pages=391–413 [402] |date=December 2009  |quote=Within the category of legal acts provided for by the TFEU, a distinction is made between legislative acts and non-legislative acts. Legislative acts are decisions adopted under the ordinary or special legislative procedure (Article 289(3) of the TFEU) and non-legislative acts are decisions that are adopted pursuant to delegation or for the purpose of implementing a legislative act (Articles 35 See Article 288 of the TFEU, last 290 and 291 of the TFEU)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Westminster system]], an item of primary legislation is known as an [[Act of Parliament]] after enactment.

Legislation is usually proposed by a member of the legislature (e.g. a member of Congress or Parliament), or by the executive, whereupon it is debated by members of the legislature and is often amended before [[passage (legislature)|passage]]. Most large legislatures enact only a small fraction of the bills proposed in a given [[Session (parliamentary procedure)|session]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/two_column_table/Resumes.htm Senate.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a given bill will be proposed and is generally a matter of the legislative priorities of government.

Legislation is regarded as one of the three main functions of government, which are often distinguished under the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]]. Those who have the formal power to ''create'' legislation are known as [[legislator]]s; a [[judiciary|judicial branch]] of government will have the formal power to ''interpret'' legislation (see [[statutory interpretation]]); the [[executive branch]] of government can act only within the powers and limits set by the law.

== Latest revision ==
The function and procedures are primarily the responsibility of the legislature. However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when [[constitutional law]] or [[secondary legislation]] is enacted. Such other forms of law-making include [[referendum]]s, [[Order in Council|orders in council]] or [[regulations]]. The term ''legislation'' is sometimes used to include these situations, or the term ''[[primary legislation]]'' may be used to exclude these other forms.

==Dead letter==
{{Expand section|date=September 2016}}
The phrase "dead letter" refers to legislation that has not been revoked, but that has become inapplicable or obsolete or is no longer enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/dead-letter Dead Letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11698">'''Moral syncretism''' consists of the attempt to reconcile disparate or contradictory [[Morality|moral beliefs]], often while melding the [[ethics|ethical]] practices of various schools of thought.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==The role of moral syncretism==
The requirements of a global ethic call for "a minimal basic [[consensus]] relating to binding values, irrevocable standards and moral attitudes, which can be affirmed by all religions despite their undeniable dogmatic or theological differences and should also be supported by non-believers."&lt;ref name="Global Ethic and Human Responsibilities"&gt;{{cite web | title=Global Ethic and Human Responsibilities | author=[[Hans Küng]] | work=Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, Santa Clara University (2007) | url=http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/focusareas/global_ethics/laughlin-lectures/global-ethic-human-responsibility.html | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot, however, make the specific ethics of the different [[religions]] and [[philosophies]] around the world superfluous or obsolete, nor should it strive to do so.&lt;ref name="Global Ethic and Human Responsibilities"/&gt;

[[Syncretism]] tends to facilitate coexistence and constructive interaction between different cultures ([[intercultural competence]]), a factor that has recommended it to rulers of multi-ethnic [[empire|realm]]s. Conversely the rejection of syncretism, usually in the name of "[[piety]]" and "orthodoxy," may help to generate, bolster or authorize a sense of [[Cultural identity|cultural unity]] in a well-defined minority or majority. While strengthening the ethical [[Cultural identity|identity]] of the [[subculture|subgroup]], this is often detrimental to the [[Cooperation|unity]] of the whole.

==Morality independent of religion==
A [[cornerstone]] of moral syncretism is that [[religion]] cannot be morality's only arbiter.

The [[Dalai Lama]], for example, has said that compassion and affection are human values that are independent of religion: "We need these human values. I call these [[secular ethics]], secular beliefs. There’s no relationship with any particular religion. Even without religion, even as nonbelievers, we have the capacity to promote these things."&lt;ref name="The Dalai Lama Interview"&gt;{{cite web | author=Amitabh Pal | title=The Dalai Lama Interview | work=The Progressive (January 2006) | url=http://www.progressive.org/mag_intv0106 | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion is also supported by the [[traditional]] [[Judeo-Christian]] concept of [[natural law]]. In his book ''On Law, Morality and Politics'', [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] identifies the innate rational nature of humans as being what defines moral law: "The rule and measure of human acts is the reason, which is the first principle of human acts."&lt;ref name="Natural Law"&gt;{{cite web | title=Natural Law | work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2006) | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/n/natlaw.htm | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not, however, mean secular ethics and religion are mutually exclusive. In fact, many principles, such as the [[Golden Rule (ethics)|Golden Rule]], are present in both systems, and some religious people, as well as some [[Deists]], prefer to adopt a rational approach to ethics.

===Atheism and morality===
Most [[atheists]] argue that no religious basis is necessary for one to live an ethical life.&lt;ref name="Is Atheism Consistent With Morality?"&gt;{{cite web | title=Is Atheism Consistent With Morality? | author=Mark I. Vuletic | work=Modern Documents, The Secular Web Library (2001) | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mark_vuletic/moral.html | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that atheists are as motivated towards moral behavior as anyone, or more, citing a range of non-theistic sources of moral behavior including: parental love, their conventional (or advanced) [[education|educated upbringing]], natural [[empathy]], [[compassion]] and the [[humanism|humane concern]]; respect for [[norm (social)|social norms]], [[criminal law]] stemming from [[natural law]], [[Police|police or other enforced order]] (and in some cases [[social order|society]]); and a desire for a good reputation and self-esteem. According to this view, ethical behavior is a natural consequence of altruistic motivation, not stemming from divine or tenet-prescribed system of punishment or reward [[Karma|in life]] and/or after death, though experiences and tentative expectations may instead play a role in forming and strengthening a moral atheist's motivations and ethics, united in rejection of any theory of all human beings' [[afterlife]]. Thus while atheism does not entail any particular moral philosophy, many atheists are drawn towards philosophies and worldviews such as: [[secular humanism]], [[empiricism]], [[objectivist philosophy|objectivism]], or [[utilitarianism]], which provide a moral framework that is not founded on faith in deities.{{or|date=January 2013}}

===Humanist ethics===
[[Humanism|Humanists]] endorse [[Moral universalism|universal morality]] based on the commonality of [[human nature]] and the belief that knowledge of right and wrong is based on our understanding of individual and joint interests, rather than a system of ethics stemming from a transcendental or arbitrarily local source, rejecting [[faith]] completely as a basis for moral action. The humanist ethics goal is a search for viable individual, social and political principles of conduct, judging them on their ability to enhance human well-being and individual responsibility.

The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU) is the worldwide umbrella organization for those adhering to the Humanist life stance. Member organisations and individual members are required to accept the following statement:

:Humanism is a [[democracy|democratic]] and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not theistic, and it does not accept supernatural views of reality.

Humanism is also known to adopt principles of the [[Golden Rule (ethics)|Golden Rule]]. As [[Oscar Wilde]] once said, "Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live." This emphasizes a respect for other people's identities and ideals.

===School of Economic Science===
The [[School of Economic Science]] (SES) is an [[organisation]] based in [[Mandeville Place]], [[London]], founded by Leon MacLaren in 1937. Originally constituted to facilitate the study of [[economics]], over time it came to focus on [[philosophy]], particularly the [[Hindu]] tradition of [[Advaita Vedanta]].&lt;ref name="Welcome to the School of Economic Science"&gt;{{cite web | title=Welcome to the School of Economic Science | work=School of Economic Science, www.schooleconomicscience.org | url=http://www.schooleconomicscience.org/ | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North America]], the SES is also known as the [[School of Practical Philosophy]], or by other similar names.  In [[Australia]], it is known as the School of Philosophy.  Although the SES has been highly criticized for its methodology and alleged motives,&lt;ref name="School abuse inquiry"&gt;{{cite web | title=School abuse inquiry | author=Victoria Macdonald | work=Channel 4 News - World (14 Mar 2006) | url=http://www.channel4.com/news/special-reports/special-reports-storypage.jsp?id=1946 | accessdate=2007-06-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070529054617/http://www.channel4.com/news/special-reports/special-reports-storypage.jsp?id=1946 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; it purports to be a syncretic school of moral philosophy.

==Religions that incorporate moral syncretism==
Several groups have taken on the challenge of establishing a [[world community]] through  doctrine, faith and practice.

===Unitarian Universalism===
[[Unitarian Universalism]] is a [[liberal religion|theologically liberal]] [[List of religions#Unitarian Universalism|religion]] characterized by its support of "a free and responsible search for truth and meaning."&lt;ref name="A Free and Responsible Search for Truth and Meaning"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Free and Responsible Search for Truth and Meaning |work=A Sermon by the Rev. James R. Bridges |url=http://home.hvc.rr.com/uucrt/a_free_and_responsible_search_fo.htm |accessdate=2007-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212144944/http://home.hvc.rr.com/uucrt/a_free_and_responsible_search_fo.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This principle permits Unitarian Universalists a wide range of beliefs and practices. Some communities even offer a class called "Building Your Own Theology."

Many Unitarian Universalists consider themselves [[humanism|humanists]], while others hold [[Christian]], [[Buddhist]], [[Jew]]ish, [[pagan]], [[atheist]], [[agnostic]], [[pantheist]], or other beliefs.  Some choose to attach no particular theological label to their idiosyncratic combination of beliefs.  Others consider themselves to be Unitarian Universalists in theology and seek moral orientation in the [[Unitarian Universalist Association|Unitarian Universalist Association's]] [[Unitarian Universalism#Seven Principles and Purposes|Seven Principles]] and [[Unitarian Universalism#Six Sources|Six Sources]].  This diversity of views is considered a strength, since the emphasis is placed on a common search for a meaningful existence, rather than an adherence to a particular [[doctrine]].

===Universal Sufism===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Soefiembleem.gif|thumb|The symbol of Universal Sufism, "Tughra Inayati"]] --&gt;
The philosophy of [[Universal Sufism]] revolves around a [[Cooperation|unity]] of all people and [[religion]]s, as well as the ability to find [[beauty]] in all things. It is a form of [[Sufism]] that does not exist within the traditional framework of [[Islam]] and  was most likely influenced by [[Advaita]] philosophy. Universal Sufism is characterised by its respect (if not inclusion) for other devotional traditions and its disapproval of miracles.

It is mandated that Universal Sufis should strive to "realize and spread the knowledge of Unity, the religion of Love, and Wisdom, so that the biases and prejudices of faiths and beliefs may, of themselves, fall away, the human heart overflow with love, and all hatred caused by distinctions and differences be rooted out."&lt;ref name="The 3 Objects of the Sufi Movement"&gt;{{cite web | title=The 3 Objects of the Sufi Movement | work=Hazrat Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan, Sufi Ruhaniat International (1956-2006) | url=http://www.ruhaniat.org/readings/3Objects.php | accessdate=2007-06-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070307134652/http://www.ruhaniat.org/readings/3Objects.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1305">'''''Nemesis''''' (Greek: ''νέμεσις'') is a philosophical term first created by [[Aristotle]] in his [[Nicomachean Ethics]]. The term means one who feels pain caused by others' undeserved success. It is part of a trio of terms, with ''epikhairekakia'' (ἐπιχαιρεκακία ) meaning one who takes pleasure in others' pain, similar to [[Schadenfreude]], and ''[[phthonos]]'' (φθόνος) meaning one who feels pain caused by any pleasure, deserved or not, similar to [[envy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pedrick | first = Victoria | authorlink = |author2=Oberhelman, Steven M.  | year = 2006 | title = The Soul of Tragedy: Essays on Athenian Drama | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago, IL | isbn = 978-0-226-65306-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Page:The ethics of Aristotle.djvu/68|''Nicomachean Ethics'', 2.7.1108b1-10]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''O mark''', also known as '''Marujirushi''' ({{lang|ja|丸印}}) in Japan and '''Gongpyo''' ({{lang|ko|공표}}, 공標, ball mark) in Korea, is the name of the symbol "⭕" used to represent affirmation in [[East Asia]], similar to its Western equivalent of the [[tick (check mark)|checkmark]]. Its opposite is the [[X mark]] ("✗") or ("×").

==Hanamaru==
The {{Nihongo|'''hanamaru'''|花丸}} is a variant of the O mark used in [[Japan]], written as 💮. It is typically drawn as a spiral surrounded by rounded flower petals, suggesting a flower. It is frequently used in praising or complimenting children, and the motif often appears in children's characters and logos.

The hanamaru is frequently written on tests if a student has achieved full marks or an otherwise outstanding result. Sometimes used in place of an O mark in grading written response problems if a student's answer is especially good. Some teachers will add more rotations to the spiral the better the answer is. It is also used as a symbol for good weather.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[File:Satyres en Atlante Rome Louvre 2.jpg|thumb|Four statues depicting ''omphaloskepsis'']]
'''''Omphaloskepsis''''' or '''navel-gazing''' is contemplation of one's [[navel]] as an aid to [[meditation]].&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|omphaloskepsis|accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] words {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὀμφαλός|ὀμφᾰλός]]}} ({{transl|grc|[[Omphalos|omphalós]]}}, {{Literal translation|'navel'|lk=on}}) and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σκέψις|σκέψῐς]]}} ({{transl|grc|sképsis}}, {{Literal translation|'viewing, examination, speculation'}}).&lt;ref name=MW/&gt;

Actual use of the practice as an aid to contemplation of basic principles of the cosmos and [[human nature]] is found in the practice of [[yoga]] of [[Hinduism]] and sometimes in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Continuum Encyclopedia of Symbols| first=Udo| last=Becker| publisher=[[Continuum International]]| year=2000| page=210| isbn=978-0-8264-1221-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In yoga, the navel is the site of the manipura (also called nabhi) [[chakra]], which yogis consider "a powerful chakra of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Whispers beyond the Edge| first=Royal L.| last=Craig| publisher=[[Xlibris]]| year=2010| page=99| isbn=978-1-4500-7972-3}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Yantra Yoga| first=Chogyal Namkhai| last=Norbu| publisher=Snow Lion| year=2008| page=15| isbn=978-1-55939-308-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monks of [[Mount Athos]], Greece, were described as ''Omphalopsychians'' by J.G. Minningen, writing in the 1830s, who says they "...pretended or fancied that they experienced celestial joys when gazing on their umbilical region, in converse with the Deity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39074/39074-h/39074-h.htm#Page_40 |title=Curiosities of Medical Experience |publisher=Richard Bentley |edition=2nd |date=1839 |location=London |first=J.G. |last=Millingen |page=40 |accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, phrases such as "contemplating one's navel" or "[[wikt:navel-gazing|navel-gazing]]" are frequently used, usually in [[jocular]] fashion, to refer to self-absorbed pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Abbreviations Acronyms Glossary for American Readers| first=E.R.| last=Lyn

An '''organizational chart''' (often called '''organization chart''', '''org chart''', '''organigram(me)''', or '''organogram''') is a [[diagram]] that shows the [[organizational structure|structure]] of an [[organization]] and the relationships and relative ranks of its parts and positions/jobs. The term is also used for similar diagrams, for example ones showing the different elements of a field of knowledge or a group of languages.

==Overview==
The organization chart is a diagram showing graphically the relation of one official to another, or others, of a company. It is also used to show the relation of one department to another, or others, or of one function of an organization to another, or others. This chart is valuable in that it enables one to visualize a complete organization, by means of the picture it presents.&lt;ref name="HB 1922"&gt;Allan Cecil Haskell, Joseph G. Breaznell (1922) ''[https://archive.org/stream/graphicchartsin00breagoog#page/n90 Graphic charts in business: how to make and use them]''. p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

A company's organizational chart typically illustrates relations between people within an organization. Such relations might include managers to sub-workers, directors to managing directors, chief executive officer to various departments, and so forth. When an organization chart grows too large it can be split into smaller charts for separate departments within the organization. The different types of organization charts include:
* [[Hierarchical organization|Hierarchical]]
* [[Matrix management|Matrix]]
* [[Flat organization|Flat]] (also known as [[Horizontal organization|Horizontal]])

There is no accepted form for making organization charts other than putting the principal official, department or function first, or at the head of the sheet, and the others below, in the order of their rank. The titles of officials and sometimes their names are enclosed in boxes or circles. Lines are generally drawn from one box or circle to another to show the relation of one official or department to the others.&lt;ref name="HB 1922"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Tabulating Machine Co Organization Chart.jpg|thumb|Organization chart of Tabulating Machine Co., 1917]]
The Scottish-American engineer [[Daniel McCallum]]  (1815–1878) is credited for creating the first organizational charts of American business&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] (1962). ''Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the American Industrial Enterprise''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; around 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Burton S. Kaliski (2001). ''Encyclopedia of business and finance''. p.669.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For years people believed no copy of this chart survived, see for example: Sidney Pollard, Richard S. Tedlow (2002) ''Economic History''. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; This chart was drawn by [[George Holt Henshaw]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Rosenthal (2012) "[http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/big_data_in_the_age_of_the_telegraph Big data in the age of the telegraph]" in McKinsey Quarterly, March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "organization chart" came into use in the early twentieth century. In 1914 [[Willard C. Brinton|Brinton]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Brinton, Willard Cope]]. ''Graphic methods for presenting facts''. The Engineering magazine company, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; declared "organization charts are not nearly so widely used as they should be. As organization charts are an excellent example of the division of a total into its components, a number of examples are given here in the hope that the presentation of organization charts in convenient form will lead to their more widespread use." In those years industrial engineers promoted the use of organization charts.

In the 1920s a survey revealed that organizational charts were still not common among ordinary business concerns, but they were beginning to find their way into administrative and business enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Hamilton institute]] (1923) ''[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.35128001192606 Organization charts].'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "organigram" originated in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Stevenson (2010) ''Oxford Dictionary of English''. p. 1252&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
There are several limitations of organizational charts:
* If updated manually, organizational charts can very quickly become out-of-date, especially in large organizations that change their staff regularly.
* They only show "formal relationships" and tell nothing of the pattern of human (social) relationships which develop. They also often do not show horizontal relationships.
* They provide little information about the managerial style adopted (e.g. "[[autocratic]]", "[[democracy|democratic]]" or an intermediate style).
* In some cases, an [[organigraph]] may be more appropriate, particularly if one wants to show non-linear, non-hierarchical relationships in an organization.
* They often do not include customers.

==Examples==
[[Image:Organizational chart.svg|thumb|right|Sample military chart]]
The example on the right shows a simple hierarchical organizational chart.

An example of a "line relationship" (or [[chain of command]] in military relationships) in this chart would be between the general and the two colonels - the colonels are directly responsible to the general.

An example of a "lateral relationship" in this chart would be between "Captain A", and "Captain B" who both work on level and both report to the "Colonel B".

Various shapes such as rectangles, squares, triangles, circles can be used to indicate different roles. Color can be used both for shape borders and connection lines to indicate differences in authority and responsibility, and possibly formal, advisory and informal links between people. A department or position yet to be created or currently vacant might be shown as a shape with a dotted outline. Importance of the position may be shown both with a change in size of the shape in addition to its vertical placement on the chart.

{{Jewish outreach}}

'''Orthodox Jewish outreach''', often referred to as '''Kiruv''' or '''Keruv''' ({{lang-he-n|קירוב , קֵרוּב}} "bringing close"), is the collective work or movement of [[Orthodox Judaism]] that reaches out to non-Orthodox Jews to encourage belief in [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] and living according to Orthodox [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The process of a Jew becoming more observant of Orthodox Judaism is called ''teshuva'' ("return" in Hebrew) making the "returnee" a ''[[baal teshuva]]'' ("master of return"). Orthodox Jewish outreach has worked to enhance the rise of the [[baal teshuva movement]].

==Varieties==

===Haredi===
{{Main|Aish HaTorah | Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem | Machon Shlomo | Kiruv Organisation}}
The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the founding of the non-Hasidic, Haredi institutions that eventually became the [[Aish HaTorah]], [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Somayach]], and Machon Shlomo yeshivas.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

[[Rabbi Noah Weinberg]] was one of the pioneers of this movement with Aish HaTorah.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Ohr Somayach has also played a major role in the baal teshuva movement through its education of generations of students.{{Citation needed|date = October 2017}}

The world's first baal teshuva yeshiva for men was [[Hadar Hatorah]] which opened in New York in 1962 under Rabbi Yisroel Jacobson, and continues to operate today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hadar Hatorah Celebrates Golden Jubilee • CrownHeights.info - Chabad News, Crown Heights News, Lubavitch NewsCrownHeights.info – Chabad News, Crown Heights News, Lubavitch News|url=http://crownheights.info/chabad-news/44507/hadar-hatorah-celebrates-golden-jubilee|website=crownheights.info|accessdate=2017-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other baal teshuva yeshivas include the Diaspora Yeshiva, founded by Rabbi Mordechai Goldstein in Jerusalem's Old City in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbDQpgZILuwC&amp;pg=PA330 |title=Judaism and Crisis: Crisis as a catalyst in Jewish cultural history|first1=Armin |last1=Lange|first2=K.

Baal teshuva yeshivas for women include Neve Yerushalayim, founded in 1970, and [[EYAHT]], affiliated with Aish HaTorah and founded in 1982.

Concurrent with the opening of baal teshuva learning programs in Israel in the 1970s, a small number of Orthodox outreach workers began approaching English-speaking, college-age students visiting the [[Western Wall]] and inviting them to experience a [[Shabbat]] meal with a host family or to check out one of the baal teshuva yeshivas. These outreach workers included Rabbi Meir Schuster, Baruch Levine, and, beginning in 1982, [[Jeff Seidel]].&lt;ref name=jweek&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/2519/-hunter-at-kotel-seeks-shabbat-dinner-guests/|title='Hunter' at Kotel Seeks Shabbat Dinner Guests|first=Todd|last=Winer|work=Chicago Jewish News|date=9 February 1996|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zhdp9btWGWQC&amp;pg=PA537 |title= Where Heaven Touches Earth: Jewish Life in Jerusalem from Medieval Times to the Present|first=Dovid|last=Rossoff|page=537|publisher=Feldheim Publishers|year=2001|isbn= 0873068793|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bjl&gt;{{cite web |url= http://baltimorejewishlife.com/news/news-detail.php?SECTION_ID=37&amp;ARTICLE_ID=55720|title=BJL Exclusive: Jeff Seidel and Yohanan Danziger Miraculously Escape Jerusalem Arab Stoning Unharmed|first=Margie|last=Pensak|work=Baltimore Jewish Life|date=27 December 2014|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Orthodox===
{{Main|Modern Orthodox Judaism outreach}}
Within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]], the [[Union of Orthodox Congregations]] created the [[National Conference of Synagogue Youth]] (NCSY) to reach Jewish teenagers in public schools.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Founded by Rabbi [[Pinchas Stolper]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;the movement also developed its in-house literature geared to the newly observant mainly written by Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]].{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

==== NJOP ====
{{Main|NJOP}}
In 1987, an organization called National Jewish Outreach Program (NJOP) was founded by [[Ephraim Buchwald]].

===Chabad===
{{Main|Chabad outreach}}
Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], 6th leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch branch of [[Hasidic Judaism]], and then his successor, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] were responsible for turning Chabad's activities toward outreach.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Each in turn sent out rabbinic emissaries, known as "[[Shaliach (Chabad)|Shluchim]]", and their wives to settle in places across the world solely for the purpose of teaching those who did not receive a Jewish education or to inspire those who did. The vehicle chosen for this was termed a "[[Chabad house]]."

[[Chabad]] has been active in reaching out to Jews through its synagogues and communal institutions, as well as more direct outreach efforts, such as its [[Mitzvah tank]]s. The organization has been recognized as using free holiday services to reach out across denominations.&lt;ref&gt;Fishkoff, Sue.

==Day schools==
{{Main|Jewish day school | Torah Umesorah - National Society for Hebrew Day Schools}}

[[Torah Umesorah - National Society for Hebrew Day Schools|Torah Umesorah: The National Society for Hebrew Day Schools]] was founded by Rabbi [[Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz]]. It is an American Orthodox organization which has opened hundreds of day schools and provides resources to many different Orthodox Jewish day schools. It has an outreach effort called Partners In Torah whereby volunteer Orthodox men and women learn on the phone for an hour a week with a non-Orthodox study-partner. A similar program run by Chabad is called Jnet. Torah Umesorah also sponsors the SEED Program whereby young Yeshiva students spend a few weeks during their summers teaching, this is similar to the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] "peace corps" which are Yeshiva-student pairs that visit remote Jewish communities over the summers to help develop Jewish communities by teaching.

Like the [[Penman equation]], the '''Penman–Monteith equation''' (after [[Howard Penman]] and [[John Monteith]]) approximates net [[evapotranspiration]] (ET), requiring as input daily mean temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and solar radiation. Other than radiation, these parameter are implicit in the derivation of &lt;math&gt; \Delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; c_p &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \delta_q &lt;/math&gt;, if not conductances below.

The United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) standard methods for modeling evapotranspiration use a Penman–Monteith equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richard G. Allen |author2=Luis S. Pereira |author3=Dirk Raes |author4=Martin Smith |title=Crop Evapotranspiration – Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/x0490e00.HTM |series=FAO Irrigation and drainage paper 56 |year=1998 |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |location=Rome, Italy |isbn=92-5-104219-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard methods of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] modify that Penman–Monteith equation for use with an hourly time step. The [[SWAT model]] is one of many [[GIS]]-integrated hydrologic models&lt;ref&gt;[http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~aggrass/models/hydrology.html Examples of GIS integrated continuous simulation hydrologic models]&lt;/ref&gt; estimating ET using Penman–Monteith equations.

Evapotranspiration contributions are very significant in a watershed's [[water balance]], yet are often not emphasized in results because the precision of this component is often weak relative to more directly measured phenomena, e.g. rain and stream flow. In addition to weather uncertainties, the Penman–Monteith equation is sensitive to vegetation specific parameters, e.g. [[stoma]]tal resistance or conductance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keith Beven |year=1979 |title=A sensitivity analysis of the Penman–Monteith actual evapotranspiration estimates |journal=[[Journal of Hydrology]] |volume=44 |issue=3–4 |pages=169–190 |bibcode=1979JHyd...44..169B |doi=10.1016/0022-1694(79)90130-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaps in knowledge of such are filled by educated assumptions, until more specific data accumulates.

Various forms of [[crop coefficient]]s (K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) account for differences between specific vegetation modeled and a ''reference evapotranspiration'' (RET or ET&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) standard. Stress coefficients (K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) account for reductions in ET due to environmental stress (e.g. [[soil saturation]] reduces [[root]]-zone O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, low [[soil moisture]] induces [[wilting|wilt]], [[air pollution]] effects, and salinity). Models of native vegetation cannot assume crop management to avoid recurring stress.

Note: Often resistances are used rather than conductivities.
:&lt;math&gt; g_a = \tfrac{1}{ r_a} ~ ~ \And ~ ~ g_s = \tfrac{1}{ r_s} = \tfrac{1}{ r_c}&lt;/math&gt;
where r&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the resistance to flux from a vegetation canopy to the extent of some defined boundary layer.

Also note that &lt;math&gt;g_s&lt;/math&gt; varies over each day, and in response to conditions as plants adjust such traits as stoma openings. Being sensitive to this parameter value, the Penman–Monteith equation obviates the need for more rigorous treatment of &lt;math&gt;g_s&lt;/math&gt; perhaps varying within each day. Penman's equation was derived to estimate daily ET from daily averages.

This also explains relations used to obtain &lt;math&gt; \delta q &lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; in addition to assumptions key to reaching this simplified equation.

==Priestley–Taylor==
The '''Priestley–Taylor''' equation was developed as a substitute to the Penman–Monteith equation to remove dependence on observations. For Priestley–Taylor, only radiation (irradiance) observations are required. This is done by removing the aerodynamic terms from the Penman–Monteith equation and adding an empirically derived constant factor, &lt;Math&gt;\alpha&lt;/Math&gt;.

The underlying concept behind the Priestley–Taylor model is that an air mass moving above a vegetated area with abundant water would become saturated with water. In these conditions, the actual evapotranspiration would match the Penman rate of potential evapotranspiration. However, observations revealed that actual evaporation was 1.26 times greater than potential evaporation, and therefore the equation for actual evaporation was found by taking potential evapotranspiration and multiplying it by &lt;Math&gt;\alpha&lt;/Math&gt;. The assumption here is for vegetation with an abundant water supply (i.e. the plants have low moisture stress). Areas like arid regions with high moisture stress are estimated to have higher &lt;Math&gt;\alpha&lt;/Math&gt; values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=M. E. Jensen, R. D. Burman &amp; R. G. Allen |year=1990 |title=Evapotranspiration and Irrigation Water Requirement |series=ASCE Manuals and Reports on Engineering Practices |volume=70 |publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-87262-763-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption that an air mass moving over a vegetated surface with abundant water saturates has been questioned later. The lowest and turbulent part of the atmosphere, the [[atmospheric boundary layer]], is not a closed box, but constantly brings in dry air from higher up in the atmosphere towards the surface. As water evaporates more easily into a dry atmosphere, evapotranspiration is enhanced. This explains the larger than unity value of the Priestley-Taylor parameter &lt;Math&gt;\alpha&lt;/Math&gt;. The proper equilibrium of the system has been derived and involves the characteristics of the interface of the atmospheric boundary layer and the overlying free atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Culf|first1=A.|title=Equilibrium evaporation beneath a growing convective boundary layer|journal=Boundary-Layer Meteorology|date=1994|volume=70|pages=34–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Heerwaarden|first1=C.

'''Prajñā''' ([[Sanskrit]]) or '''paññā''' ([[Pāli]]) "wisdom" is insight in the true nature of reality, namely primarily [[anicca]] (impermanence), [[dukkha]] (dissatisfaction or suffering), [[anatta|anattā]] (non-self) and [[śūnyatā]] (emptiness).

==Etymology==
''Prajñā'' is often translated as "wisdom", but is closer in meaning to "insight", "non-discriminating knowledge", or "intuitive apprehension".{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=218}}

* ''jñā'' can be translated as "consciousness", "knowledge", or "understanding".&lt;ref group=web&gt;See, e.g., Monier-Williams (1899), "jña," p. 425 (retrieved 14 August 2012 from "Cologne U." at [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0425-jehila.pdf mw0425-jehila.pdf]).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Pra'' is an intensifier which can be translated as "higher", "greater", "supreme" or "premium",&lt;ref group=web&gt;See, e.g., Monier-Williams (1899), "prā," p. 652 (retrieved 14 Aug. 2012 from "Cologne U." at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0659-prajalpana.jpg)&lt;/ref&gt; or "being born or springing up",{{sfn|Loy|1997|p=136}} referring to a spontaneous type of knowing.{{sfn|Loy|1997|p=136}}

==Understanding in the Buddhist traditions==
''Paññā'' is the fourth virtue of ten Theravāda ''[[pāramitā|pāramitās]]'', and the sixth of the six Mahāyāna ''pāramitās''.

===Theravada Buddhism===
In the [[Pāli Canon]], ''paññā'' is [[Samādhi|concentrated]] [[vipassana|insight]] into the [[Three marks of existence|three characteristics]] of all things, namely [[anicca|impermanence]], [[dukkha|suffering]] and [[anatta|no-self]], and the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57054-1 |pages=140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|page=47}}, '''Quote:''' "All phenomenal existence [in Buddhism] is said to have three interlocking characteristics: impermanence, suffering and lack of soul or essence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Olson|title=The Different Paths of Buddhism: A Narrative-Historical Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QRp-AixBLKUC |year=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-3778-8 |pages=63–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 5th-century exegetical work ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', one of the most revered books in Theravada Buddhism, [[Buddhaghosa|Buddhaghoṣa]] states that the function of ''paññā'' is "to abolish the darkness of [[Avidya (Buddhism)|delusion]]".{{sfn|Buddhaghosa|Ñāṇamoli|1999|p=437}}

===Mahāyāna Buddhism===
{{See also|Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction}}
In Mahayana Buddhism, the importance of prajna was stressed in combination with [[Karuṇā|karuna]], compassion. It took a central place in the ''[[Perfection of Wisdom|Prajñā-pāramitā Sutras]]'', such as the [[Heart Sutra]]. Prajna is spoken of as the principal means of attaining [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvāna]], through its revelation of the true nature of all things as [[Sunyata|emptiness]].

'''Saṃsāra''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|m|ˈ|s|ɑr|ə}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means "wandering" or "world", with the connotation of cyclic, circuitous change.{{Sfn|Klaus Klostermaier|2010|p=604}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}} It also refers to the concept of rebirth and "cyclicality of all life, matter, existence", a fundamental assumption of all [[Indian religions]], in short, it is the cycle of death and rebirth.{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}&lt;ref name="Gross1993p148"/&gt; ''Saṃsāra'' is sometimes referred to with terms or phrases such as transmigration, karmic cycle, [[reincarnation]], and "cycle of aimless drifting, wandering or mundane existence".{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}&lt;ref name="Firth1997p106"/&gt;

The concept of ''Saṃsāra'' has roots in the [[Vedas|Vedic literature]], but the theory is not discussed there. It appears in developed form, but without mechanistic details, in the early [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref name=amboyer/&gt;{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90-99}} The full exposition of the ''Saṃsāra'' doctrine is found in [[Sramana|Sramanic]] religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], as well as various schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] after about the mid-1st millennium BCE.{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90-99}}&lt;ref name="Krishan1997p17"/&gt; The ''Saṃsāra'' doctrine is tied to the [[Karma]] theory of Indian religions, and the liberation from ''Saṃsāra'' has been at the core of the spiritual quest of Indian traditions, as well as their internal disagreements.{{Sfn|Obeyesekere|2005|p=1-2, 108, 126-128}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=272-273}} The liberation from ''Saṃsāra'' is called [[Moksha]], [[Nirvana]], Mukti or Kaivalya.&lt;ref name="Firth1997p106"/&gt;{{Sfn|Michael Myers|2013|p=36}}{{Sfn|Harold Coward|2008|p=103}}

==Etymology and terminology==
''Saṃsāra'' ([[Sanskrit]]: संसार) means "wandering",{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}{{Sfn| Lochtefeld|2002|p=589}} as well as "world" wherein the term connotes "cyclic change".{{Sfn|Klaus Klostermaier|2010|p=604}} ''Saṃsāra'' is a fundamental concept in all [[Indian religions]], is linked to the [[karma]] theory, and refers to the belief that all living beings cyclically go through births and rebirths. The term is related to phrases such as "the cycle of successive existence", "transmigration", "karmic cycle", "the wheel of life", and "cyclicality of all life, matter, existence".{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271-272}}&lt;ref name="Gross1993p148"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rita M. Gross |title=Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK37AxCfxVEC  |year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-0513-1 |pages=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ykrishanp24/&gt; Many scholarly texts spell ''Saṃsāra'' as ''Samsara''.&lt;ref name="Gross1993p148"/&gt;{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|1997|p=10}}

According to Monier-Williams, ''Saṃsāra'' is rooted in the term ''Saṃsṛ'' (संसृ), which means "to go round, revolve, pass through a succession of states, to go towards or obtain, moving in a circuit".&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1040|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=1040–1041}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conceptual form from this root appears in ancient texts as ''Saṃsaraṇa'', which means "going around through a succession of states, birth, rebirth of living beings and the world", without obstruction.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara/&gt; The term shortens to ''Saṃsāra'', referring to the same concept, as a "passage through successive states of mundane existence", a transmigration, metempsychosis, a circuit of living where one repeats previous states, from one body to another, a worldly life of constant change, that is rebirth, growth, decay and redeath.&lt;ref name="Firth1997p106"/&gt;&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger1980p268"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger |title=Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C |year=1980|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-03923-0|pages=268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is then contrasted with the concept of [[moksha]], also known as ''mukti'', ''nirvana'', ''nibbana'' or ''kaivalya'', which refers to liberation from this cycle of aimless wandering.&lt;ref name="Firth1997p106"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shirley Firth |title=Dying, Death and Bereavement in a British Hindu Community |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYNXC-HK1u0C |year=1997|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-6831-976-7|pages=106, 29–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara/&gt;

The concept of Samsara developed in the [[Vedas|Vedic]] times, and is traceable in the [[Samhita]] layers such as in sections 1.164, 4.55, 6.70 and 10.14 of the [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref name="amboyer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=valleepoussin24&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis de La Vallée-Poussin | authorlink=Louis de La Vallée-Poussin|title=The way to Nirvana: six lectures on ancient Buddhism as a discipline of salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ito8AAAAIAAJ|year=1917|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=24–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krishan1997p11"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan |title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC |year=1997|publisher= Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|isbn=978-81-208-1233-8 |pages=11–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the idea is mentioned in the [[Samhita]] layers of the Vedas, there is lack of clear exposition there, and the idea fully develops in the early [[Upanishads]].{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|p=90}}{{Sfn|Dalal|2010|p=344, 356-357}} Damien Keown states that the notion of "cyclic birth and death" appears around 800 BCE.{{Sfn|Damien Keown|2004|p=248}} The word ''Saṃsāra'' appears, along with [[Moksha]], in several [[Principal Upanishads]] such as in verse 1.3.7 of the [[Katha Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/कठोपनिषदत्/प्रथमोध्यायः/तृतीयवल्ली Katha Upanishad प्रथमोध्यायः/तृतीयवल्ली] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; verse 6.16 of the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/श्वेताश्वतरोपनिषत्/षष्ठः_अध्यायः Shvetashvatara Upanishad षष्ठः अध्यायः] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; verses 1.4 and 6.34 of the [[Maitri Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/मैत्रायण्युपनिषत् Maitri Upanishad] Wikisource, Quote: ३ चित्तमेव हि '''संसारम्''' तत्प्रयत्नेन शोधयेत्&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GA Jacob (1963), [https://archive.org/stream/UpanishadVakyaKosha-AConcordanceOfThePrincipalUpanishadsAndBhagavad/UpanishadVakyaKoshaSktEng#page/n953/mode/2up A concordance to the Principal Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita], Motilal Banarsidass, pages 947-948&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Samsara'' is related to ''Saṃsṛti'', the latter referring to the "course of mundane existence, transmigration, flow, circuit or stream".&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssamsara/&gt;

==Definition and rationale==
The word literally means "wandering through, flowing on", states Stephen J. Laumakis, in the sense of "aimless and directionless wandering".{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|p=97}} The concept of ''Saṃsāra'' is closely associated with the belief that the person continues to be born and reborn in various realms and forms.&lt;ref name="GoaEtCoward2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/hinduism/|title=Hinduism|work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=2015-07-31|archivedate=2014-02-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227223922/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/hinduism/|deadurl=no|date=2014-08-21|first1=David J.|last1=Goa|first2=Harold G.|last2=Coward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest layers of Vedic text incorporate the concept of life, followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Hastings|author2=John Alexander Selbie|author3=Louis Herbert Gray|title=Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UD8TAAAAYAAJ |year=1922|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark|pages=616–618}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ancient Vedic [[Rishi]]s challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and the texts assert that it would be unfair for god [[Yama]] to judge and reward people with varying degrees of virtue or vices, in "either or" and disproportionate manner.{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=84-86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kusum P. Merh |title=Yama, the Glorious Lord of the Other World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XSoKAQAAMAAJ |year=1996|publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-81-246-0066-5 |pages=213–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Anita Raina Thapan|title=The Penguin Swami Chinmyananda Reader |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iDiRLzPFOPIC |year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-400062-3 |pages=84–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They introduced the idea of an afterlife in heaven or hell in proportion to one's merit, and when this runs out, one returns and is reborn.{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=84-86}}&lt;ref name="Krishan1997p17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan |title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC |year=1997|publisher= Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|isbn=978-81-208-1233-8 |pages=17–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrul Rinpoche|author2=Dalai Lama|title=The Words of My Perfect Teacher: A Complete Translation of a Classic Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40i38mGQ6aAC |year=1998|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7619-9027-7|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea appears in ancient and medieval texts, as the cycle of life, death, rebirth and redeath, such as section 6:31 of the [[Mahabharata]] and section 6.10 of [[Devi Bhagavata Purana]].{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=84-86}}&lt;ref name=ykrishanp24&gt;Yuvraj Krishan (1988), Is Karma Evolutionary?, Journal of Indian Council of Philosophical Research, Volume 6, pages 24-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=valleepoussin24/&gt;

==History==
The historical origins of a concept of a cycle of repeated [[reincarnation]] are obscure but the idea appears in texts of both India and ancient Greece during the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman C. McClelland|title=Encyclopedia of Reincarnation and Karma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S_Leq4U5ihkC |year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5675-8 |pages=102–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clifton D.

The idea of Samsara is hinted in the early Vedic texts such as the [[Rigveda]], but the theory is absent.&lt;ref name=amboyer&gt;A.M. Boyer (1901), Etude sur l'origine de la doctrine du samsara, Journal Asiatique, Volume 9, Issue 18, pages 451-453, 459-468&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vallee Pussin|title=The way to Nirvana: six lectures on ancient Buddhism as a discipline of salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ito8AAAAIAAJ|year=1917|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early textual layers of the Vedas mention and anticipate the doctrine of [[Karma]] and rebirth, however states Stephen Laumakis, the idea is not fully developed.{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|p=90}} It is in the early Upanishads where these ideas are more fully developed, but there too the discussion does not provide specific mechanistic details.{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|p=90}} The detailed doctrines flower with unique characteristics, starting around the mid 1st millennium BCE, in diverse traditions such as in Buddhism, Jainism and various schools of [[Hindu philosophy]].{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90-99}}

Some scholars state that the ''Samsara'' doctrine may have originated from the [[Sramana]] traditions and was then adopted by the Brahmanical traditions (Hinduism).&lt;ref name=floodaithp86&gt;Gavin D. Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, page 86, '''Quote''': “The origin and doctrine of Karma and Samsara are obscure. These concepts were certainly circulating amongst sramanas, and Jainism and Buddhism developed specific and sophisticated ideas about the process of transmigration. It is very possible that the karmas and reincarnation entered the mainstream brahmanical thought from the sramana or the renouncer traditions. Yet, on the other hand, although there is no clear doctrine of transmigration in the vedic hymns, there is the idea of redeath, that a person having died in this world, might die yet again in the next.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Padmanabh S. Jaini 2001 “Collected Paper on Buddhist Studies” Motilal Banarsidass,  {{ISBN|81-208-1776-1}}, page 51, '''Quote''': "Yajnavalkya’s reluctance to discuss the doctrine of karma in public (...) can perhaps be explained by the assumption that it was, like that of the transmigration of soul, of non-brahmanical origin.

=== Punarmrityu: redeath ===
While ''Saṃsāra'' is usually described as rebirth and reincarnation of living beings, the chronological development of the idea over its history began with the questions on what is the true nature of human existence and whether people die only once. This led first to the concepts of ''Punarmṛtyu'' ("redeath") and ''Punaravṛtti'' ("return").&lt;ref name="Doniger1980p268"/&gt;{{Sfn|Buitenen|1957|pp=34-35}}{{Sfn|Mircea Eliade|1987|pp=56-57}} These early theories asserted that the nature of human existence involves two realities, one unchanging absolute [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul) which is somehow connected to the ultimate unchanging immortal reality and bliss called [[Brahman]],{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|p=18}}{{Sfn|John Bowker|2014|pp=84-85}} and that the rest is the always-changing subject (body) in a phenomenal world ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]).{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=18-19, 24-25}}{{Sfn|Harold Coward|2012|pp=29-31}}{{Sfn|John Geeverghese Arapura|1986|pp=85-88}} Redeath, in the Vedic theosophical speculations, reflected the end of "blissful years spent in ''svarga'' or heaven", and it was followed by rebirth back in the phenomenal world.&lt;ref name="EllwoodAlles2007p406"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert S.

The dualistic devotional traditions such as [[Madhvacharya]]'s Dvaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a theistic premise, assert the individual human soul and Brahman (Vishnu, Krishna) are two different realities, loving devotion to Vishnu is the means to release from Samsara, it is the grace of Vishnu which leads to moksha, and spiritual liberation is achievable only in after-life (''videhamukti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D.

{{main article|Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Karma in Jainism}}
[[File:Saṃsāra.jpg|thumb|Symbolic depiction of Saṃsāra at Shri Mahaveerji temple of Jainism.]]
In [[Jainism]], the ''Saṃsāra'' and Karma doctrine are central to its theological foundations, as evidenced by the extensive literature on it in the major sects of Jainism, and their pioneering ideas on karma and ''Saṃsāra'' from the earliest times of the Jaina tradition.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=217-236}}&lt;ref name=dundasp14/&gt; ''Saṃsāra'' in Jainism represents the worldly life characterized by continuous rebirths and suffering in various realms of existence.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=226-228}}&lt;ref name=dundasp14&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 14–16, 102–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sethia2004p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tara Sethia |title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conceptual framework of the Saṃsāra doctrine differs between the Jainism traditions and other Indian religions. For instance, in Jaina traditions, soul (''jiva'') is accepted as a truth, as is assumed in the Hindu traditions, but not assumed in the Buddhist traditions. However, Saṃsāra or the cycle of rebirths, has a definite beginning and end in Jainism.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=226}}

Souls begin their journey in a primordial state, and exist in a state of consciousness continuum that is constantly evolving through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=227}} Some evolve to a higher state, some regress asserts the Jaina theory, a movement that is driven by the karma.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=227-228}} Further, Jaina traditions believe that there exist ''Abhavya'' (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain [[moksha]] (liberation).{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=226}}&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p105"&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 104–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Abhavya'' state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=225}} Jainism considers souls as pluralistic each in a karma-''Saṃsāra'' cycle, and does not subscribe to [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] style [[nondualism]] of Hinduism, or [[Madhyamaka|Advaya]] style nondualism of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p105"/&gt;

The Jaina theosophy, like ancient [[Ajivika]], but unlike Hindu and Buddhist theosophies, asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations, as they circle through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=228}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Padmanabh S. Jaini|title=Collected Papers on Jaina Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPggiM7y1aYC |year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1691-6|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the soul cycles, states Padmanabh Jaini, Jainism traditions believe that it goes through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=223-224}} With all human and non-human activities, such as rainfall, agriculture, eating and even breathing, minuscule living beings are taking birth or dying, their souls are believed to be constantly changing bodies. Perturbing, harming or killing any life form, including any human being, is considered a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=224-225}}&lt;ref name="Sethia2004p31"/&gt;

A liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond ''Saṃsāra'', is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a ''Siddha''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=222-223}} A male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in Jainism, particularly in the Digambara sect of Jainism;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajAEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36|year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85773-656-7|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harveyp182&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Harvey |title=Religions in Focus: New Approaches to Tradition and Contemporary Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrTsCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182|year=2016|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-93690-8|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this view has been historically debated within Jainism and different Jaina sects have expressed different views, particularly the Shvetambara sect that believes that women too can achieve liberation from ''Saṃsāra''.&lt;ref name=harveyp182/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 55–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Buddhist texts which do not expressly or unambiguously condemn injuring or killing plants and minor life forms, Jaina texts do.

''Saṃsāra'' in Buddhism, states Jeff Wilson, is the "suffering-laden cycle of life, death, and rebirth, without beginning or end".&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeff Wilson|year= 2010|title= Saṃsāra and Rebirth, in Buddhism| publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 9780195393521| doi=10.1093/obo/9780195393521-0141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also referred to as the wheel of existence (''Bhavacakra''), it is often mentioned in Buddhist texts with the term ''punarbhava'' (rebirth, re-becoming); the liberation from this cycle of existence, ''Nirvana'', is the foundation and the most important purpose of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conze2013p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Conze |title= Buddhist Thought in India: Three Phases of Buddhist Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kY5TAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-54231-4|pages=71 }}, '''Quote:''' "Nirvana is the ''raison d’être'' of Buddhism, and its ultimate justification."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=119}}

Samsara is considered impermanent in Buddhism, just like other Indian religions. Karma drives this impermanent Samsara in Buddhist thought, states Paul Williams, and "short of attaining enlightenment, in each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with the completely impersonal causal nature of one's own karma; This endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath is ''Saṃsāra''".{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=74-75}} The [[Four Noble Truths]], accepted by all Buddhist traditions, are aimed at ending this Samsara-related re-becoming (rebirth) and associated cycles of suffering.{{sfn|Paul Williams|Anthony Tribe|Alexander Wynne|2012|pp=30–42}}{{sfn|Robert Buswell Jr. |Donald Lopez Jr. |2013|pp=304-305}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|editor=Steven M.

The dukkha of these is compounded by the rebirth perspective of Buddhism, for this involves repeated re-birth, re-aging, re-sickness, and re-death."&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Jainism, Buddhism developed its own Samsara theory, that evolved over time the mechanistic details on how the wheel of mundane existence works over the endless cycles of rebirth and redeath.&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Trainor |title= Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517398-7 |pages=62–63 }}; '''Quote:''' "Buddhist doctrine holds that until they realize nirvana, beings are bound to undergo rebirth and redeath due to their having acted out of ignorance and desire, thereby producing the seeds of karma".&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dalai Lama|1992|pp=xi-xii, 5-16}} In early Buddhist traditions, ''Saṃsāra'' cosmology consisted of five realms through which wheel of existence recycled.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt; This included hells (''niraya''), hungry ghosts (''pretas''), animals (''tiryak''), humans (''manushya''), and gods (''devas'', heavenly).&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert DeCaroli |title=Haunting the Buddha: Indian Popular Religions and the Formation of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_2XtkSRyTYC|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-803765-1|pages=94–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In latter traditions, this list grew to a list of six realms of rebirth, adding demi-gods (''asuras'').&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Akira Sadakata|title=Buddhist Cosmology: Philosophy and Origins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1997|publisher= Kōsei Publishing 佼成出版社, Tokyo|isbn=978-4-333-01682-2|pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "hungry ghost, heavenly, hellish realms" respectively formulate the ritual, literary and moral spheres of many contemporary Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt;

The Saṃsāra concept, in Buddhism, envisions that these six realms are interconnected, and everyone cycles life after life, and death is just a state for an afterlife, through these realms, because of a combination of ignorance, desires and purposeful [[karma]], or ethical and unethical actions.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt; Nirvana is typically described as the freedom from rebirth and the only alternative to suffering of ''Samsara'', in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Collins2010p38"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl B.

=={{IAST|Saṅsāra}} in Sikhism==
Sikhism incorporates the concepts of ''Saṃsāra'' (sometimes spelled as Sansara in Sikh texts), ''Karma'' and cyclical nature of time and existence.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"&gt;{{cite book|author= Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title= Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn_jBAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-5366-1 |pages=145–146, 181, 220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colesambhi13/&gt; Founded in the 15th century, its founder [[Guru Nanak]] had a choice between the cyclical concept of ancient Indian religions and the linear concept of early 7th-century Islam, and he chose the cyclical concept of time, state Cole and Sambhi.&lt;ref name=colesambhi13&gt;{{cite book|author1=W.O. Cole |author2=Piara Singh Sambhi |title=Sikhism and Christianity: A Comparative Study |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8KMCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Springer |isbn= 978-1-349-23049-5 |pages= 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title= Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn_jBAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-5366-1 |page=176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, states Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, there are important differences between the ''Saṅsāra'' concept in Sikhism from the ''Saṃsāra'' concept in many traditions within Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt; The difference is that Sikhism firmly believes in the grace of God as the means to salvation, and its precepts encourage the [[bhakti]] of One Lord for ''mukti'' (salvation).&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H. S. Singha |title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqIbJz7vMn0C |year=2000|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=978-81-7010-301-1 |pages=68, 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikhism, like the three ancient Indian traditions, believes that body is perishable, there is a cycle of rebirth, and that there is suffering with each cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh |author2=Louis E.

Rather, it cherishes social engagement and householder's life combined with devotion to the One God as Guru, to be the path of liberation from ''Saṅsāra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh |author2=Louis E.

'''''Scriptio continua''''' ([[Latin]] for "continuous script"), also known as '''''scriptura continua''''' or '''''scripta continua''''', is a style of writing without [[space (punctuation)|space]]s, or [[word divider|other marks]] between the words or sentences. The form also lacks [[punctuation]], [[diacritic]]s, or distinguished [[letter case]]. 
In the West, the oldest Greek and Latin inscriptions used [[word divider]]s to separate words in sentences; however, [[Classical Greek]] and late [[Classical Latin]] both employed ''scriptio continua'' as the norm.&lt;ref&gt;E. Otha Wingo. (1972). Latin punctuation in the classical age. The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brent Harmon Vine (1993). Studies in archaic Latin inscriptions. Innsbruck: Institut für Sprachwissenschaft der Universität Innsbruck.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although ''scriptio continua'' is evidenced in most Classic Greek and Classic Latin manuscripts, different writing styles are depicted in documents that date back even further. And it must be noted that Classical Latin did often use the [[interpunct]], especially in monuments and inscriptions.

The earliest texts in Classical Greek that used the Greek alphabet, as opposed to [[Linear B]], were formatted in a constant string of capital letters from right to left. Later, this evolved to “[[boustrophedon]],” which included lines written in alternating directions. It was only later on that the Romans adapted the [[Etruscan alphabet]] to write Latin and, in the process, switched from using points to divide words to the Greek practice of ''scriptio continua''.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, F. C. T.. (2001). Scribes and Texts: A Test Case for Models of Cultural Transmission. The Monist, 84(3), 417–436. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/27903738&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of the [[codex]] (book), Latin and Greek script was written on scrolls by enslaved scribes. The role of the scribe was to simply record everything he heard, in order to leave documentation. Because the free form of speech is so continuous, adding inaudible spaces to manuscripts would have been considered illogical.{{fact|date=February 2017}} Furthermore, at a time when ink and papyrus were quite costly, adding spaces would be an unnecessary waste of such writing mediums. Typically, the reader of the text was a trained performer, who would have already memorized the content and breaks of the script. During these reading performances, the scroll acted as a cue sheet, and therefore did not require in-depth reading.
 
While the lack of word parsing forced the reader to distinguish elements of the script without a visual aid, it also presented him with more freedom to interpret the text. The reader had the liberty to insert pauses and dictate tone, making the act of reading a significantly more subjective activity than it is today. However, the lack of spacing also led to some ambiguity because a minor discrepancy in word parsing could give the text a different meaning. For example, a phrase written in ''scriptio continua'' as ''collectamexiliopubem'' may be interpreted as ''collectam ex Ilio pubem'', meaning "a people gathered from Troy", or ''collectam exilio pubem'', "a people gathered for exile". Thus, readers had to be much more cognizant of the context to which the text referred.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, M. B. "Antiquity: Aids for Inexperienced Readers and the Prehistory of Punctuation." Pause and Effect: An Introduction to the History of Punctuation in the West. Berkeley: U of California, 1993. 10-11. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
Over time, the current system of rapid silent reading for information replaced the older, slower, and more dramatic performance based reading,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard A. Lanham]] (2006). ''The Economics of Attention''. {{ISBN|0-226-46882-8}}. page 113-115&lt;/ref&gt; and word dividers and punctuation became more beneficial to text.&lt;ref&gt;Burnley, D.. (1995). Scribes and Hypertext. The Yearbook of English Studies, 25, 41–62. http://doi.org/10.2307/3508817&lt;/ref&gt; Though paleographers disagree about the chronological decline of ''scriptio continua'' throughout the world, it is generally accepted that the addition of spaces first appeared in Irish and Anglo-Saxon Bibles and Gospels from the seventh and eighth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Saenger, Paul (1997) Space between words: the origins of silent reading, Stanford University Press, Stanford, California, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, an increasing number of European texts adopted conventional spacing, and within the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, all European texts were written with word separation.&lt;ref&gt;Saenger, Paul (1997) Space Between Words: The Origins of Silent Reading, Stanford University Press, Stanford, California, pages 120-1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

When word separation became the standard system, it was seen as a simplification of Roman culture because it undermined the metric and rhythmic fluency generated through ''scriptio continua''. In contrast, paleographers today identify the extinction of ''scriptio continua'' as a critical factor in augmenting the widespread absorption of knowledge in the Pre-Modern Era. By saving the reader the taxing process of interpreting pauses and breaks, the inclusion of spaces enables the brain to comprehend written text more rapidly. Furthermore, the brain has a greater capacity to profoundly synthesize text and commit a greater portion of information to memory.&lt;ref&gt;Saenger, Paul (1997) Space Between Words: The Origins of Silent Reading, Stanford University Press, Stanford, California, pages 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Scriptio continua'' is still in use in [[Thai alphabet|Thai]], other Southeast Asian [[abugida]]s, ([[Burmese alphabet|Burmese]], [[Khmer alphabet|Khmer]], [[Javanese script|Javanese]], [[Balinese script|Balinese]], [[Sundanese script]]), [[Lao alphabet|Lao]], and in languages that use [[Chinese character]]s ([[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]). However, modern [[vernacular Chinese]] differentiates itself from ancient ''scriptio continua'' through its use of punctuation, although this method of separation was borrowed from the West only about a century ago. Before this, the only forms of punctuation found in Chinese writings were marks to denote quotes, proper nouns, and emphasis. Modern [[Tibetan languages|Tibetic languages]] also employ a form of ''scriptio continua''; while they punctuate syllables, they do not use spacing between units of meaning.

==Examples==
===Latin text===
Latin text in ''scriptio continua'' with typical capital letters, taken from [[Cicero]]'s ''De finibus bonorum et malorum'':

*&lt;span style="word-break: break-all"&gt;NEQVEPORROQVISQVAMESTQVIDOLOREMIPSVMQVIADOLORSITAMETCONSECTETVRADIPISCIVELIT&lt;/span&gt;

Which in modern punctuation is:

*''Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit…''
*"Nobody likes pain for its own sake, or looks for it and wants to have it, just because it is pain…"
With ancient Latin punctuation is: &lt;span style="word-break: break-all"&gt;NEQVE•PORRO•QVISQVAM•EST•QVI•DOLOREM•IPSVM•QVIA•DOLOR•SIT•AMET•CONSECTETVR•ADIPISCI•VELIT&lt;/span&gt;

===Modern Latin script===
A form of ''scriptio continua'' has become common in internet [[e-mail address]]es and [[domain name]]s where, because the "space" character is invalid, the address for a website for "Example Fake Website" is written as &lt;code&gt;examplefakewebsite.com&lt;/code&gt; – without spaces between the separate words. However, the "underscore" or "dash" characters are often used as stand-ins for the "space" character when its use would be invalid and their use would not be.

===Chinese language===
The Chinese language did not encounter the problem of incorporating spaces into their text because, unlike most [[Orthography|orthographic systems]], where words are formed by combining a series of letters, each character already represented its own word or [[morpheme]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, F. C. T.. (2001). Scribes and Texts: A Test Case for Models of Cultural Transmission. The Monist, 84(3), 417–436. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/27903738&lt;/ref&gt; On top of that, Chinese also lacked any form of punctuation until the 20th century as a result of interaction with [[Western civilization|Western civilizations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.tutorming.com/mandarin-chinese-learning-tips/how-to-use-chinese-punctuation|title=How To Use: Chinese Punctuation|last=Fang|first=Angela|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below is an example of a normal Chinese sentence, then what it would look like without spaces or punctuation, followed by what it would look like with spaces between words, then afterwards by a [[pinyin]] transcription (in which words are normally divided), and finally an English translation:
*{{lang|zh|北京在中国北方；广州在中国南方。}}
*'''北京在中国北方广州在中国南方'''
*{{lang|zh|北京　在　中国　北方；　广州　在　中国　南方。}}
*Běijīng zài Zhōngguó běifāng; Guǎngzhōu zài Zhōngguó nánfāng.
*[[Beijing]] is in Northern China; [[Guangzhou]] is in Southern China.

=== Japanese script ===
Like Chinese, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] implements extensive use of [[Chinese characters]], called [[kanji]] in Japanese. However, due to the radical differences between the Chinese and Japanese languages, writing Japanese exclusively in kanji would make Japanese extremely difficult to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saiga-jp.com/japanese_language.html|title=Japanese Language &amp; Characters - Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji|website=www.saiga-jp.com|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be evidenced in Japanese texts that predate the modern [[Kana|kana system]], in which Japanese was written entirely in kanji and [[man'yōgana]], the latter of which are [[Grapheme|characters]] written solely to indicate a word's [[pronunciation]] as opposed to its meaning. For that reason, different [[syllabary]] systems called kana were developed to differentiate phonetic [[Grapheme|graphemes]] from [[ideographic]] ones.

Modern Japanese is typically written using three different types of [[Grapheme|graphemes]], the first being kanji and the latter two being kana systems, the cursive [[hiragana]] and the angular [[katakana]]. While spaces are not normally used in writing, boundaries between words are often quickly perceived by Japanese speakers since kana are usually visually distinct from kanji. Japanese speakers also know that certain words, morphemes, and parts of speech are typically written using one of the three systems. Kanji is typically used for words of Japanese and Chinese origin as well as [[Content word|content words]] (i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Hiragana is typically used for native Japanese words, as well as commonly known words, phrases, and [[Grammatical particle|particles]], as well as inflections of content words like verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Katakana is typically used for loanwords from languages other than Chinese, [[onomatopoeia]], and emphasized words.

Like Chinese, Japanese lacked any sort of punctuation until interaction with Western civilizations became more common. Punctuation was adopted during the [[Meiji period|Meiji Period]].

Below is an example sentence of Japanese written first in hiragana, katakana and kanji without spaces between words, second in hiragana, katakana and kanji with spaces in between words (including particles), third only in hiragana and katakana, fourth in romaji, fifth the sentence translated in English, and finally in kanji and man'yōgana.
* ベサニー・ヒルズと高森昭は東京に住んでいます。
* ベサニー・ヒルズ　と　高森　昭　は　東京　に　住んでいます。
* ベサニー・ヒルズ　と　たかもり　あきら　は　とうきょう　に　すんでいます。
* Besanī Hiruzu to Takamori Akira wa Tōkyō ni sundeimasu.
* Bethany Hills and Akira Takamori are living in Tokyo.
* 邊三仁伊日流頭吐高森昭歯東京仁須無弟位麻須

=== Thai script ===
The modern Thai script, which was said to have been created by [[Ram Khamhaeng|King Ram Khamhaeng]] in 1283, does not contain any spaces between words, but spaces only indicate the clear endings of clauses or sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/thai.htm|title=Thai language, alphabet and pronunciation|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is a sample sentence of Thai written first without spaces between words (with Thai romanization in parentheses), second written in Thai with spaces between words (also with Thai romanization in parentheses), then finally translated into English.
* ในน้ำมีปลา ในนามีข้าว (Nın̂ảmīplā  nınāmīk̄ĥāw)
* ใน น้ำ มี ปลา  ใน นา มี ข้าว (Nı n̂ả mī plā  nı nā mī k̄ĥāw)

'''Self-dissimilarity''' is a measure of [[complexity]] defined in a series of papers by [[David Wolpert]] and [[William G.

The degrees of self-dissimilarity between the [[pattern recognition|patterns]] of a [[system theory|system]] observed at various [[scale factor|scale]]s (e.g. the average [[matter density]] of a physical body for [[volume]]s at different [[orders of magnitude]]) constitute a complexity "signature" of that system.

'''Siemon Allen''' (born in [[Durban]], South Africa) is an artist working mainly with [[installation art|installations]]. He is living and working in the United States. Allen is considered one of the most prominent exponents of the South African arts diaspora in the Northeastern USA.&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Sue |author2=Perryer, Sophie (ed.) |others= |title=10 years 100 artists: art in a democratic South Africa |publisher=Struik |year=2004 |pages=34–37 |isbn=978-1-86872-987-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Siemon Allen studied fine arts at the Technikon Natal in Durban, where he graduated with a Master of Arts in 1999. During his studies he got to know his future wife, an American, and together they moved to the US later on. Today, Allen is working as a visiting professor at the department for sculpture and extended media at the [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.vcu.edu/sculpture/portfolios/siemon-allen/ Allen's profile on Virginia University's homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

While still living in South Africa, Allen was founding member of the FLAT Gallery (1993–1995) within the context of an artists' initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siemonallen.org/flat.html Flat-project on the artist's homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen's works were exhibited at the 2nd Johannesburg Biennale as part of the exhibition "Graft".he hasn't talked mostly about his private life in public life His works are part of many collections in- and outside of South Africa, including the collections of the Durban Art Gallery, the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City&lt;ref name="Williamson" /&gt; and the [[Standard Bank]] Collection.

== Work philosophy ==
Siemon Allen is a passionate collector and [[archivist]] of South African [[ephemera]], which he uses to create large-scale visual and informational [[installation art|installations]]. Accordingly, these works are entitled "collection projects" and primarily explore the concept of creating identity through distance and the image of South Africa in general.

For his installations, Allen systematically accumulates mass-produced printed materials, which he catalogues and exhibits. The working process thus is similar to the one of an archivist.
As a South African living abroad, Allen is especially interested in exploring and understanding how a country is seen from outside and what is the country's role in building this image. In the early 2000s he came across a website of the South African government that strongly advertised an appeal for positive branding-politics outside of the country as well as for the recruitment of non-governmental South Africans living abroad to act as "ambassadors" for the country. Allen's installations both debunk this essentialist thought of a South African "brand" and contribute to it.

Allen's actual project is about the creation of a vast, internet-based archive of audio-documents regarding the South African history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flatinternational.org/ Homepage of his project "Flat International"]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition which resulted from this archive was called "Records" and was shown in South Africa in 2009 and in the US in 2010.

'''Socialist law''' or '''Soviet law''' denotes a general type of [[legal system]] which has been used in [[communist state|socialist and formerly socialist states]]. It is based on the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, with major modifications and additions from [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. There is controversy as to whether socialist law ever constituted a separate legal system or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=840224|pages=781–808|last1=Quigley|first1=J.|title=Socialist Law and the Civil Law Tradition|volume=37|issue=4|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|year=1989|doi=10.2307/840224}}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, prior to the end of the [[Cold War]], ''socialist law'' would be ranked among the major legal systems of the world.

While civil law systems have traditionally put great pains in defining the notion of [[private property]], how it may be acquired, transferred, or lost, socialist law systems provide for most property to be owned by the [[State (polity)|state]] or by agricultural co-operatives, and having special courts and laws for state enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Soviet-law|title=Soviet law|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars argue that socialist law was not a separate legal classification.&lt;ref name="austin"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112849|title=The Death of Socialist Law?|journal = Annual Review of Law and Social Science |volume = 3|issue = |pages = 233–253|last = Markovits |first = I.|date=December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[command economy]] approach of the communist states meant that most types of property could not be owned, the [[Soviet Union]] always had a civil code, courts that interpreted this civil code, and a civil law approach to legal reasoning (thus, both legal process and legal reasoning were largely analogous to the [[France|French]] or [[Germany|German]] civil code system). Legal systems in all socialist states preserved formal criteria of the Romano-Germanic civil law; for this reason, law theorists in post-socialist states usually consider the socialist law as a particular case of the Romano-Germanic civil law. Cases of development of [[common law]] into socialist law are unknown because of incompatibility of basic principles of these two systems (common law presumes influential rule-making role of courts while courts in socialist states play a dependent role).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Soviet-law|title=Soviet law|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet legal theory==
Soviet law displayed many special characteristics that derived from the socialist nature of the Soviet state and reflected [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. [[Vladimir Lenin]] accepted the Marxist conception of the law and the state as instruments of coercion in the hands of the bourgeoisie and postulated the creation of popular, informal tribunals to administer revolutionary justice. One of the main theoreticians of Soviet socialist legality in this early phase was [[Pēteris Stučka]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Alongside this [[utopian]] trend was one more critical of the concept of "[[proletarian]] justice", represented by [[Evgeny Pashukanis]]. A dictatorial trend developed that advocated the use of law and legal institutions to suppress all opposition to the regime. This trend reached its zenith under [[Joseph Stalin]] with the ascendancy of [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], when the administration of justice was carried out mainly by the security police in [[NKVD troika|special tribunals]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

During the [[de-Stalinization]] of the [[Nikita Khrushchev]] era, a new trend developed, based on socialist legality, that stressed the need to protect the procedural and statutory rights of citizens, while still calling for obedience to the state. New legal codes, introduced in 1960, were part of the effort to establish legal norms in administering laws. Although socialist legality remained in force after 1960, the dictatorial and utopian trends continued to influence the legal process. Persecution of political and religious dissenters continued, but at the same time there was a tendency to [[decriminalization|decriminalize]] lesser offenses by handing them over to people's courts and administrative agencies and dealing with them by education rather than by incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elie |first=Marc |editor-last1=Kozlov |editor-first1=Denis |editor-last2=Gilburd |editor-first2=Eleonory  |date=2013 |title=The Thaw: Soviet Society and Culture during the 1950s and 1960s |publisher=Toronto University Press |pages=109{{hyphen}}142 |chapter=Khrushchev's Gulag: the Soviet Penitentiary System after Stalin's death, 1953-1964 |section-url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00859338/ |access-date=October 30, 2017 |isbn=978-1442644601 |id=HAL 00859338}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By late 1986, the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] era was stressing anew the importance of [[individual rights]] in relation to the state and criticizing those who violated [[procedural law]] in implementing Soviet justice. This signaled a resurgence of socialist legality as the dominant trend. Socialist legality itself still lacked features associated with Western jurisprudence.

== Characteristic traits ==
Socialist law is similar to [[common law]] or [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] but with a greatly increased [[public law]] sector and decreased [[private law]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glenn|first=H. Patrick|title=Legal Traditions of the World: Sustainable Diversity in Law|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eERrPWIQn2kC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=%22Socialist+law%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rQY-TPrODY6UjAf49cX5Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Socialist%20law%22&amp;f=false|edition= 4th |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-19-958080-4 |oclc=650838256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* extensive social warrants of the state (the rights to a job, free education, free healthcare, retirement at 60 for men and 55 for women, maternity leave, free disability benefits and sick leave compensation, subsidies to multichildren families, ...) in return for a high degree of social mobilization.
* the judicial process lacks [[adversarial system|adversary]] character; public prosecution is considered as "provider of justice."
* partial or total expulsion of the former [[ruling classes]] from the public life at early stages of existence of each socialist state; however, in all socialist states this policy gradually changed into the policy of "one socialist nation without classes"
* diversity of political views directly discouraged.
* the ruling Communist party was eventually subject to prosecution through party committees in first place.
* abolition of [[Private property#Socialist perspectives|private property]] considered as a primary goal of socialism, if not its defining characteristic, thus near total collectivization and nationalization of the means of production;
* subordination of the judiciary to the Communist Party
* low respect for [[privacy]], extensive control of the party over private life;
* low respect for [[intellectual property]] as knowledge and culture was considered a right for human kind, and not a privilege as in the free market economies.

A specific institution characteristic to Socialist law was the so-called [[burlaw court]] (or, verbally, "court of comrades", Russian товарищеский суд) which decided on minor offences.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Chinese Socialist law==
Among the remaining communist governments, some (most notably the [[People's Republic of China]]) have added extensive modifications to their legal systems. In general, this is a result of their [[free market|market-oriented]] economic changes. However, some communist influence can still be seen. For example, in Chinese [[real estate]] law there is no unified concept of [[real property]]; the state owns all land but often not the structures that sit on that land. A rather complex ''[[ad hoc]]'' system of [[use (law)|use rights]] to land property has developed, and these use rights are the things being officially traded (rather than the property itself). In some cases (for example in the case of [[city|urban]] residential property), the system results in something that resembles real property transactions in other legal systems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In other cases, the Chinese system results in something quite different. For example, it is a common misconception that reforms under [[Deng Xiaoping]] resulted in the [[privatization]] of agricultural land and a creation of a [[land tenure]] system similar to those found in [[Western world|Western]] countries. In actuality, the village committee owns the land and [[contract]]s the right to use this land to individual farmers who may use the land to make money from agriculture. Hence the rights that are normally unified in Western economies are split up between the individual farmer and the village committee.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

This has a number of consequences. One of them is that, because the farmer does not have an absolute right to transfer the land, he cannot borrow against his use rights. On the other hand, there is some insurance against risk in the system, in that the farmer can return his land to the village committee if he wants to stop farming and start some other sort of business. Then, if this business does not work, he can get a new contract with the village committee and return to farming. The fact that the land is redistributable by the village committee also ensures that no one is left landless; this creates a form of [[social welfare]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There have been a number of proposals to reform this system and they have tended to be in the direction of fully privatizing rural land for the alleged purpose of increasing efficiency. These proposals have usually not received any significant support, largely because of the popularity of the current system among the farmers themselves. There is little risk that the village committee will attempt to impose a bad contract on the farmers, since this would reduce the amount of money the village committee receives. At the same time, the farmer has some flexibility to decide to leave farming for other ventures and to return at a later time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10213">:''"Spherical tensor" redirects to here. For the concept related to operators see [[tensor operator]].''

In [[pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]], particularly [[quantum mechanics]] and [[computer graphics]] and their applications, a '''spherical basis''' is the [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] used to express '''spherical tensors'''.  The spherical basis closely relates to the description of angular momentum in quantum mechanics and spherical harmonic functions.

While [[spherical polar coordinates]] are one [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal coordinate system]] for expressing vectors and tensors using polar and azimuthal angles and radial distance, the spherical basis are constructed from the [[standard basis]] and use [[complex number]]s.

==Spherical basis in three dimensions==

A vector '''A''' in 3D [[Euclidean space]] {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be expressed in the familiar [[Cartesian coordinate system]] in the [[standard basis]] '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[Coordinate vector|coordinates]] ''A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'':

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = A_x \mathbf{e}_x + A_y \mathbf{e}_y + A_z \mathbf{e}_z &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

or any other [[coordinate system]] with associated [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] set of vectors. From this extend the scalars to allow multiplication by complex numbers, so that we are now working in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^3&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;.

===Basis definition===

In the spherical bases denoted '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and associated coordinates with respect to this basis, denoted ''A''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the vector '''A''' is:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}  = A_+ \mathbf{e}_{+} + A_{-} \mathbf{e}_{-} + A_0 \mathbf{e}_0 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where the spherical basis vectors can be defined in terms of the Cartesian basis using [[complex number|complex]]-valued coefficients in the ''xy'' plane:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Angular Momentum|author=W.J. Thompson|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0NMjkQnQN6oC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;lpg=PA311&amp;dq=spherical+basis+tensor#v=onepage&amp;q=spherical%20basis%20tensor&amp;f=false|isbn=9783527617838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{e}_+ &amp; = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{e}_x -\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_y \\
\mathbf{e}_{-} &amp; = +\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_x - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_y \\
\end{align} \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \mathbf{e}_\pm = \mp\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\mathbf{e}_x \pm i\mathbf{e}_y\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3A}}}}

in which ''i'' denotes the [[imaginary unit]], and one normal to the plane in the ''z'' direction:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_0 = \mathbf{e}_z &lt;/math&gt;

The inverse relations are:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\mathbf{e}_x &amp; = - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{e}_+ + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_{-} \\
\mathbf{e}_y &amp; = + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{e}_+ + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_{-} \\
\mathbf{e}_z &amp; = \mathbf{e}_0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3B}}}}

===Commutator definition===
While giving a basis in a 3-dimensional space is a valid definition for a spherical tensor, it only covers the case for when the rank &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is 1. For higher ranks, one may use either the commutator, or rotation definition of a spherical tensor. The commutator definition is given below, any operator &lt;math&gt;T_q^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the following relations is a spherical tensor :


&lt;math&gt;[J_{\pm}, T_q^{(k)}]=\hbar \sqrt{(k\mp q)(k\pm q+1)}T_{q\pm 1}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;[J_{z}, T_q^{(k)}]=\hbar q T_q^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;


===Rotation definition===

Analogously to how the [[spherical harmonics]] transform under a rotation, a general spherical tensor  transforms as follows,  when the states transform under the [[unitary operator|unitary]] [[Wigner D-matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(R)&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|R}} is a (3×3 rotation) group element in [[SO(3)]]. That is, these matrices represent the rotation group elements. With the help of its [[Lie algebra]], one can show these two definitions are equivalent. 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\dagger}(R)T_q^{(k)}\mathcal{D}(R) = \sum_{q^{\prime} = -k}^k\mathcal{D}_{qq^{\prime}}^{(k)}T_{q^{\prime}}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;

{{see also| Wigner D-matrix}}

===Coordinate vectors===

{{main|Coordinate vector}}

For the spherical basis, the [[Coordinate vector|coordinates]] are complex-valued numbers ''A''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;, and can be found by substitution of ({{EquationNote|3B}}) into ({{EquationNote|1}}), or directly calculated from the [[dot product#Complex vectors|inner product]] {{langle}}, {{rangle}} ({{EquationNote|5}}):

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
A_+ &amp; = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_+, \mathbf{A}  \right\rangle = -\frac{A_x}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{iA_y}{\sqrt{2}} \\
A_{-} &amp; = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_{-}, \mathbf{A}  \right\rangle = +\frac{A_x}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{iA_y}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align} \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad A_\pm = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_\pm, \mathbf{A} \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \mp A_x + iA_y \right) &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4A}}}}

:&lt;math&gt; A_0 = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_0, \mathbf{A}  \right\rangle = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_z, \mathbf{A}  \right\rangle = A_z &lt;/math&gt;

with inverse relations:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
A_x &amp; = - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} A_+ + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} A_{-} \\
A_y &amp; = - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} A_+ - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} A_{-} \\
A_z &amp; = A_0
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4B}}}}

In general, for two vectors with complex coefficients in the same real-valued orthonormal basis '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, with the property '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;·'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'', the [[dot product#Complex vectors|inner product]] is:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{a} , \mathbf{b} \right\rangle = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}^\star = \sum_j a_j b_j^\star &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

where · is the usual [[dot product]] and the [[complex conjugate]] * must be used to keep the [[norm (mathematics)|magnitude (or "norm")]] of the vector [[Positive definiteness|positive definite]].

==Properties (three dimensions)==

===Orthonormality===

The spherical basis is an [[orthonormal basis]], since the [[dot product#Complex vectors|inner product]] {{langle}}, {{rangle}} ({{EquationNote|5}}) of every pair vanishes meaning the basis vectors are all mutually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{e}_+ , \mathbf{e}_{-} \right\rangle = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_{-} , \mathbf{e}_0 \right\rangle = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_0 , \mathbf{e}_+ \right\rangle = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and each basis vector is a [[unit vector]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\mathbf{e}_+ , \mathbf{e}_{+} \right\rangle = \left\langle\mathbf{e}_{-} , \mathbf{e}_{-} \right\rangle = \left\langle\mathbf{e}_0 , \mathbf{e}_0 \right\rangle = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

hence the need for the normalizing factors of 1/{{sqrt|2}}.

===Change of basis matrix===

{{see also|change of basis}}

The defining relations ({{EquationNote|3A}}) can be summarized by a [[transformation matrix]] '''U''':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{e}_+ \\
\mathbf{e}_{-} \\
\mathbf{e}_0
\end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{U}\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{e}_x \\
\mathbf{e}_y \\
\mathbf{e}_z
\end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{U} = \begin{pmatrix}
- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

with inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{e}_x \\
\mathbf{e}_y \\
\mathbf{e}_z
\end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{U}^{-1}\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{e}_+ \\
\mathbf{e}_{-} \\
\mathbf{e}_0
\end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{U}^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
+ \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that '''U''' is a [[unitary matrix]], in other words its [[Hermitian conjugate]] '''U'''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; ([[complex conjugate]] and [[matrix transpose]]) is also the [[inverse matrix]]  '''U'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

For the coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
A_+ \\
A_{-} \\
A_0
\end{pmatrix} =\mathbf{U}^\mathrm{*} \begin{pmatrix}
A_x \\
A_y \\
A_z
\end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{U}^\mathrm{*} = \begin{pmatrix}
- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

and inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
A_x \\
A_y \\
A_z
\end{pmatrix} = (\mathbf{U}^\mathrm{*})^{-1} \begin{pmatrix}
A_+ \\
A_{-} \\
A_0
\end{pmatrix} \,,\quad (\mathbf{U}^\mathrm{*})^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
- \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Cross products===

Taking [[cross product]]s of the spherical basis vectors, we find an obvious relation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{q}\times\mathbf{e}_{q} = \boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' is a placeholder for +, −, 0, and two less obvious relations:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{\pm}\times\mathbf{e}_{\mp} = \pm i \mathbf{e}_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{\pm}\times\mathbf{e}_{0} = \pm i \mathbf{e}_{\pm}&lt;/math&gt;

===Inner product in the spherical basis===

The inner product between two vectors '''A''' and '''B''' in the spherical basis follows from the above definition of the inner product:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{A} , \mathbf{B} \right\rangle = A_+ B_+^\star + A_{-}B_{-}^\star + A_0 B_0^\star &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18019">'''Strangulation''' in the context of [[domestic violence]] is a potentially lethal form of [[assault]]. Unconsciousness may occur within seconds of strangulation and death within minutes. Strangulation can be difficult to detect and until recently{{when|date=December 2015}} was often not treated as a serious crime. However, in many jurisdictions strangulation is now a specific criminal offense, or an aggravating factor in assault cases.

==Differences from choking==

Although sometimes the words are used interchangeably, "strangulation" and "choking" are not the same thing. Choking is when air flow is blocked by food or a foreign object in the trachea – something that can be addressed by the [[Heimlich maneuver]]. Strangulation, by contrast, is defined by reduced air flow and/or blood flow to or from the brain via the intentional external compression of blood vessels or the airway in the neck.  Notably, however, many victims of strangulation refer to the assault as "choking".

Manual strangulation (i.e., gripping the throat with one’s hands) is the most common method of strangulation in intimate partner violence, although ligatures (e.g., belts, scarves) are sometimes used.

==Epidemiology==

A systematic review of 23 articles based on 11 surveys in 9 countries (N=74,785, about two-thirds of whom were women) found that 3.0% to 9.7% of women reported that they had at some time been strangled by an intimate partner.&lt;ref name="Sorenson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sorenson SB, Joshi M, Sivitz E | year = 2014 | title = A systematic review of the epidemiology of nonfatal strangulation, a human rights and health concern | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 104 | issue = 11| page = e54-e61 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2014.302191 | pmid=25211747}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 0.4% to 2.4% – with 1.0% being typical – reported that they had experienced it in the past year, and women were between 2 times and 14 times more likely to be strangled by an intimate partner than were men.&lt;ref name="Sorenson" /&gt;

The most recent national survey in the U.S. that asked about strangulation by an intimate partner asked 16,507 adults (55% of whom were women) if a partner had tried to hurt them by choking or suffocating them. A total of 9.7% responded that a partner had done so at some point in their lifetime; 0.9% reported that it had happened during the past year.&lt;ref&gt;Black MC, Basile KC, Breiding MJ., et al.

Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011. https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of strangulation appears to be decreasing in Canada, the only country with multiple cross-sectional surveys that measure strangulation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brownridge DA |title=The elevated risk for violence against cohabiting women: A comparison of three nationally representative surveys of Canada |journal=Violence Against Women |year=2008 |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=809–832 |doi=10.1177/1077801208320368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major study of surviving victims of strangulation assault found that 99% of the 300 victims in criminal cases involving "choking" were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Strack G, McClane G, Hawley D |title=A review of 300 attempted strangulation cases – Part I: Criminal legal issues |journal=Journal of Emergency Medicine |year=2001 |volume=21 |pages=303–309 |doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(01)00399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, a meta-analytic review of gender differences in physical aggression against a heterosexual partner concluded that ". ..'choke or strangle' is very clearly a male act, whether based on self- or partner reports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Archer J |title=Sex differences in physically aggressive acts between heterosexual partners: a meta-analytic review |journal=Psychological Bulletin |year=2000 |volume=126 |issue=5 |pages=651–680 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.651 |pmid=10989615}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar conclusion was reached in a 2014 multi-nation review: "…women are more likely than men to report that they were strangled by an intimate partner."&lt;ref name="Sorenson" /&gt;

A series of studies conducted in Canada found the same gender discrepancy and reported that strangulation by an intimate is more common among disabled persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brownridge DA |title=Partner violence against women with disabilities: prevalence, risk, and explanations |journal=Violence Against Women |year=2006 |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=805–822 |doi=10.1177/1077801206292681}}&lt;/ref&gt; cohabiting (vs. married) persons,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brownridge DA |title=Understanding women's heightened risk of violence in common-law unions: Revisiting the selection and relationship hypotheses |journal=Violence Against Women |year=2004 |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=626–651 |doi=10.1177/1077801204265017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those in a step- (vs. biological) family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brownridge DA |title=Male partner violence against women in stepfamilies: an analysis of risk and explanations in the Canadian milieu |journal=Violence Vict |year=2004 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=17–36| doi=10.1891/vivi.19.1.17.33239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who had been abused by an intimate partner reported higher rates of strangulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Barrett BJ, St. Pierre M |title=Variations in women’s help seeking in response to intimate partner violence: findings from a Canadian population-based study |journal=Violence Against Women |year=2011 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=47–70 |doi=10.1177/1077801210394273 |pmid=21199809}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Macmillan R, Gartner R |title=When she brings home the bacon: Labor-force participation and the risk of spousal violence against women |journal=J Marriage Fam |year=1999 |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=947–958 |doi=10.2307/354015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strangulation is sometimes fatal. According to a large U.S. case control study, prior strangulation is a substantial and unique predictor of attempted and completed homicide of women by a male intimate partner. The study showed that the odds of becoming an attempted homicide victim increased 7-fold and the odds of becoming a homicide victim increased 8-fold for women who had been strangled by their partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Glass N, Laughon K, Campbell JC |title=Non-fatal strangulation is an important risk factor for homicide of women |journal=J Emerg Med |year=2008 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=329–335 |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2007.02.065|display-authors=etal|pmc=2573025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When over three dozen other characteristics of the victim, perpetrator, and incident were taken into account, however, strangulation no longer was a unique predictor.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Campbell JC, Webster D, Koziol-McLain J |title=Risk factors for femicide in abusive relationships: results from a multisite case control study |journal=Am J Public Health |year=2003 |volume=93 |issue=7 |pages=1089–1097 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.93.7.1089|display-authors=etal|pmc=1447915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strangulation is so common in battering (50% or more battered women report that they've been strangled) that it doesn't differentiate abuse in which the victim survives or dies.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;

==Experience of strangulation==

Strangulation has been likened to drowning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Kristie A. | last2 = Joshi | first2 = Manisha | last3 = Sorenson | first3 = Susan B. | title = "Do you know what it feels like to drown?": strangulation as coercive control in intimate relationships | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 124–137 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0361684313488354 | date = March 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0361684313488354 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1190&amp;context=spp_papers Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers at the University of Pennsylvania&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Home page |url=http://www.ortnercenter.org/ | website = ortnercenter.org | publisher = Evelyn Jacobs Ortner Center on Family Violence, University of Pennsylvania }}&lt;/ref&gt; have likened non- or near-fatal strangulation to water boarding,&lt;ref name="Sorenson" /&gt; which is widely considered a form of torture.

A special issue of the ''Domestic Violence Report'' devoted to the crime of strangulation states: "Many domestic violence offenders and rapists do not strangle their partners to kill them; they strangle them to let them know they can kill them—any time they wish. Once victims know this truth, they live under the power and control of their abusers day in and day out."&lt;ref name="Domestic Violence Report"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Law reform targets the crime of strangulation |journal=Domestic Violence Report |date = August–September 2014 |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=81–100 |url=http://www.civicresearchinstitute.com/nfjca.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.civicresearchinstitute.com/pdfs/DVR1906.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

Strangulation can produce minor injuries, serious bodily injury, and death. Evidence of the assault can be difficult to detect because many victims may not have visible injuries and/or their symptoms may be nonspecific.

Victims may have internal injuries, such as laryngo-tracheal injuries, digestive tract injuries, vascular injuries, neurological system injuries and orthopedic injuries. Clinical symptoms of these internal injuries may include neck and sore-throat pain, voice changes (hoarse or raspy voice or the inability to speak), coughing, swallowing abnormalities, and changes in mental status, consciousness and behavior. Neurological symptoms may include vision changes, dimming, blurring, decrease of peripheral vision and seeing "stars" or "flashing lights."  Post-anoxic encephalopathy, psychosis, seizures, amnesia, cerebrovascular accident and progressive dementia may be indicative of neuropsychiatric effects.&lt;ref name="Domestic Violence Report" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Joshi | first1 = Manisha | last2 = Thomas | first2 = Kristie A. | last3 = Sorenson | first3 = Susan B. | title = "I didn't know I could turn colors": health problems and health care experiences of women strangled by an intimate partner | journal = Social Work in Health Care | volume = 51 | issue = 9 | pages = 798–814 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00981389.2012.692352 | pmid = 23078012 | date = October 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00981389.2012.692352 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=spp_papers Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Malek AM, Higashida RT |year=2000 |title=Patient presentation, radiographic features, and treatment of strangulation-induced bilateral dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery |volume=92 |pages=481–487 |pmid=10701540 |doi=10.3171/jns.2000.92.3.0481|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malek AM, Higashida RT, Phatouros CC, Halbach VV |title=A strangled wife |journal=Lancet |volume=353 |issue=9161 |pages=1324 |year=1999 |pmid=10218532 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)12179-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milligan N, Anderson M |title=Conjugal disharmony: a hitherto unrecognised cause of strokes |journal=Br Med J |volume=281 |issue=6237 |pages=421–2 |year=1980 |pmid=7427300 |pmc=1713281 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.281.6237.421|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith DJ, Mills T, Taliaferro EH |title=Frequency and relationship of reported symptomology in victims of intimate partner violence: the effect of multiple strangulation attacks |journal=J Emerg Med |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=323–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11604297 |doi= 10.1016/s0736-4679(01)00402-4|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Valera EM, Berenbaum H |title=Brain injury in battered women |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=797–804 |year=2003 |pmid=12924684 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some visible signs of strangulation a victim should look for are injuries to their face, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, chin, neck, head, scalp, chest and shoulders, including: redness, scratches or abrasions, fingernail impressions in the skin, deep fingernail claw marks, ligature marks ("rope burns"), thumbprint-shaped bruises, blood-red eyes, pinpoint red spots called "petechiae" or blue fingernails.&lt;ref&gt;publication by Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention and the California District Attorneys Association|appendix 25| title= Facts That Victims of Choking (Strangulation )Need to Know!|year= 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==

For many years across the country, prosecutors have failed to treat non- and near-fatal strangulation assaults as serious crimes, largely due to the lack of physical evidence.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Because of involvement of the medical profession, specialized training for police and prosecutors, and ongoing research, strangulation has become a focus of policymakers and professionals working to reduce intimate partner violence and sexual assault..&lt;ref name="Robert Lee Bolton III, Strangulation as a Felony Offense: A New Penalty Under W.

==Improving detection and intervention==

Starting in 1995, the work of Gael Strack and Casey Gwinn in San Diego has helped identify and address challenges in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting strangulation and suffocation offenses in intimate partner violence, sexual assault, elder abuse, and child abuse cases.  In 2011, Strack and Gwinn created the Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention, the most comprehensive training program in the United States for the documentation, investigation, and prosecution of non and near-fatal strangulation assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention. |url=http://www.strangulationtraininginstitute.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have published multiple state-specific books to guide the investigation and prosecution of non and near-fatal strangulation assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Strack G, Gwinn C. |title=On the edge of a homicide: Strangulation as a prelude |journal=Criminal Justice |year=2011 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=32–36 |url=  https://www.strangulationtraininginstitute.com/file-library/on-the-edge-of-homicide-strangulation-as-a-prelude-strack-and-gwinn-2011-pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Published appellate opinions have begun to proliferate across the United States as courts are upholding felony strangulation convictions even with minimal external visible injury to the victims.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  The importance of multi-disciplinary responses by doctors, nurses, advocates, police officers, and prosecutors has become clear in properly identifying, treating, investigating, and prosecuting strangulation assaults.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8611">'''Subjective constancy''' or '''perceptual constancy''' is the [[perception]] of an object or quality as constant even though our [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]] of the object changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Gillam|first=Barbara|year=2000|chapter=Perceptual Constancy|title=Encyclopedia of psychology|volume=6|pages=89–93|editor=A. E. Kazdin|publisher=American Psychological Association and Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the physical characteristics of an object may not change, in an attempt to deal with our external world, our perceptual system has mechanisms that adjust to the stimulus.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2006 82–90"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2006|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0-495-50629-X|pages=82–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual==
There are several types of perceptual constancies in [[visual perception]]:

[[File:Ponzo illusion.gif|250px|thumb|left|[[Ponzo illusion]]: Top line is perceived as larger than the bottom line, though they are identical in size.]]
* '''Size constancy''' is one type of visual subjective constancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil|title=Psychology the Science of Behavior [4th Canadian ed.]|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, On. Canada|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a certain range, people’s perception of one particular object’s size will not change, regardless of changes in distance or the video size change on the retina. The perception of image is still based upon the actual size of the perceptual characteristics. According to optical principles, for the same object, the size of the image on the retina changes as the distance from the object to the observer changes. The greater the distance, the smaller the image is sensed by the retina. When someone is observing an object, although the distance of observation is different, the perceptional size is similar to the actual size. However, sensory and perception systems can be tricked by the use of illusions. Size constancy is related to distance, experience, and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zhijuehengchangxing_BaiduBaike|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/287477.htm|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of size constancy are [[Müller-Lyer illusion]] and [[Ponzo illusion]]. Another illusion experienced everyday is the size of the moon - when closer to the horizon, the moon appears larger. See [[moon illusion]]. Human perception is largely influenced by the environment; that is, the context in which the object is found.[[File:Shape constancy.gif|250px|thumb|right|'''Shape constancy''': We perceive the object to be a rectangular door opening but, if we drew this out, it is made up of varying shapes]]
* '''Shape constancy''' is similar to size constancy in that it relies largely on the perception of distance.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2006 82–90"/&gt; Regardless of changes to an object's orientation (such as a door opening), the shape of the object is perceived the same. That is the actual shape of the object is sensed as changing but then perceived as the same. According to Kanwisher &amp; associates, the localized part of the brain responsible for this is the extrastriate cortex.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2006 82–90"/&gt;
* '''[[Color constancy]]''' is a feature of the human [[color perception]] system which ensures that the color of an object remains similar under varying conditions&lt;ref name="Erickson"&gt;{{citation|last=Erickson|first=Robert|year=1975|title=Sound Structure in Music|publisher=University of California Press|pages=11-12|isbn=0-520-02376-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the result of a very complicated 'calculation' by an [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]] working mechanism within our [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lorenz|first=Konrad|authorlink=Konrad Lorenz|year=1961|chapter=The Role of Gestalt Perception in Animal and Human Behavior|title=Aspects of Form|pages=171|editor=Lancelot Law Whyte|publisher=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{quotation|The facts behind [[color-constancy]] phenomena...are that we require fine color discriminations less frequently than gross discriminations, and when gross discriminations enable us to maintain focus on objects of prime interest, we 'systematically overlook' differences beyond the necessary degree of fineness. The mechanism which accomplishes this 'systematic overlooking' is the information-processing system of the organism, and the principle according to which it is accomplished is that this system never expands more of its capacity on a given perceptual task than is necessary according to the current needs and interests of the agent.|Sayre&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sayre|first=K.M.|year=1968|chapter=Toward a Quantitative Model of Pattern Formation|title=Philosophy and Cybernetics|pages=149–152|editor=Frederick J. Crosson and Kenneth M. Sayre|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* '''Lightness constancy''' refers to the constancy of an object's lightness regardless of varying amounts of light cast upon it. We detect, in the context of an object's surroundings, the characteristics of the fixed physical property and, from there, the lightness remains constant despite vast changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacEvoy|first=Sean|author2=Michael A. Paradiso |title=Lightness constancy in primary visual cortex|journal=PNAS|date=14 March 2001|volume=98|issue=15|pages=8827–8831|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/15/8827.full|doi=10.1073/pnas.161280398|pmc=37520}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Luminance]].
* '''Distance constancy''' refers to the relationship between apparent distance and physical distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuroda|first=Teruhiko|title=Distance constancy|journal=Psychologische Forschung|date=1 September 1971|volume=34|issue=3|pages=199–219|doi=10.1007/BF00424606|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00424606?LI=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; An illusion example of this would be the moon - when it is near the horizon it is perceived as larger (size constancy) and/or closer to earth than when it is above our heads.
* '''Location constancy''' refers to the relationship between the viewer and the object. A stationary object is perceived as remaining stationary despite the retina sensing the object changing as the viewer moves (due to parallax).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goolkasian|first=P.|author2=A. Bojko |title=Location constancy and its effect on visual selection|journal=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health|date=June 2001|volume=14|issue=2|pages=175–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Location constancy is largely influenced by the context in which the object is found. An example of this would be looking at a parked car as you walk towards a building; the car is perceived as remaining stationary as you move forward.

==Auditory==
{{Main|Psychoacoustics}}
*In [[music]], subjective constancy is the identification of a [[musical instrument]] as constant under changing [[timbre]] or "conditions of changing [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and loudness, in different environments and with different players."&lt;ref name="Erickson"/&gt;
*In [[speech perception]] this means that vowels or consonants are perceived as constant categories even if acoustically, they vary greatly due to phonetic environment ([[coarticulation]]), speech tempo, speaker's age and sex, speaker's dialect, etc.

==Research==
*'''Comparing perception abilities in schizophrenic patients''' – A study found that distance constancy, being closely related to size constancy, was poorer in the [[schizophrenia]] patients than in the control group (labeled "normals"). "The result of poor distance constancy is that [[visual perception]] in schizophrenics is lacking in depth and that these patients live in a 'flatter' world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Thaddus E.

In [[mathematics]], a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' is a '''subset''' of a set ''B'', or equivalently ''B'' is a '''superset''' of ''A'', if ''A'' is "contained" inside ''B'', that is, all [[Element_(mathematics)|elements]] of ''A'' are also elements of ''B''. ''A'' and ''B'' may coincide. The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called '''inclusion''' or sometimes '''containment'''. ''A'' is a subset of ''B'' may also be expressed as ''B'' includes ''A''; or ''A'' is included in ''B''.

The subset relation defines a [[partial order]] on sets.

The [[algebraic structure|algebra]] of subsets forms a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] in which the subset relation is called [[inclusion (Boolean algebra)|inclusion]].

==Definitions==
If ''A'' and ''B'' are sets and every [[element (mathematics)|element]] of ''A'' is also an element of ''B'', then:
:* ''A'' is a '''subset''' of ''B'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B,&lt;/math&gt;
:or equivalently
:* ''B'' is a '''superset''' of ''A'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;B \supseteq A.&lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor|proper subset}}
If ''A'' is a subset of ''B'', but ''A'' is not [[equal (math)|equal]] to ''B'' (i.e. [[there exists]] at least one element of B which is not an element of ''A''), then 
:* ''A'' is also a '''proper''' (or '''strict''') '''subset''' of ''B''; this is written as &lt;math&gt;A \subsetneq B.&lt;/math&gt;
:or equivalently
:* ''B'' is a '''proper superset''' of ''A''; this is written as &lt;math&gt;B \supsetneq A.&lt;/math&gt;

For any set ''S'', the inclusion [[binary relation|relation]] ⊆ is a [[partial order]] on the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(S)&lt;/math&gt; of all subsets of ''S'' (the [[power set]] of ''S'') defined by &lt;math&gt;A \leq B \iff A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;. We may also partially order &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(S)&lt;/math&gt; by reverse set inclusion by defining &lt;math&gt;A \leq B \iff B \subseteq A.&lt;/math&gt; 

When quantified, {{math|A ⊆ B}} is represented as: {{math|∀x{x∈A → x∈B}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Kenneth H.|title=Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338309-5|page=119|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;span id="SYMBOLS"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- to allow easy linking to this section which contains math in its name --&gt;

==Properties==
* A  set ''A'' is a '''subset''' of ''B'' [[if and only if]] their intersection is equal to A.
:Formally:
:&lt;math&gt; A \subseteq B \Leftrightarrow A \cap B = A. &lt;/math&gt;

* A  set ''A'' is a '''subset''' of ''B'' if and only if their union is equal to B.
:Formally:
:&lt;math&gt; A \subseteq B \Leftrightarrow A \cup B = B. &lt;/math&gt;

* A '''finite''' set ''A'' is a '''subset''' of ''B'' if and only if the [[cardinality]] of their intersection is equal to the cardinality of A.
:Formally:
:&lt;math&gt; A \subseteq B \Leftrightarrow |A \cap B| = |A|. &lt;/math&gt;

==⊂ and ⊃ symbols==

Some authors use the symbols ⊂ and ⊃ to indicate ''subset'' and ''superset'' respectively; that is, with the same meaning and instead of the symbols, ⊆ and ⊇.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Rudin | first1=Walter | author1-link=Walter Rudin | title=Real and complex analysis | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | location=New York | edition=3rd | isbn=978-0-07-054234-1 | mr=924157  | year=1987|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; So for example, for these authors, it is true of every set ''A'' that {{nowrap|''A'' ⊂ ''A''}}.

Other authors prefer to use the symbols ⊂ and ⊃ to indicate ''proper''(also called strict) subset and ''proper'' superset respectively; that is, with the same meaning and instead of the symbols, ⊊ and ⊋.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Subsets and Proper Subsets | url=http://it.edgecombe.edu/homepage/killorant/MAT140/Module1/Subsets.pdf | accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage makes ⊆ and ⊂ analogous to the [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] symbols ≤ and &lt;. For example, if {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} then ''x'' may or may not equal ''y'', but if {{nowrap|''x'' &lt; ''y''}}, then ''x'' definitely does not equal ''y'', and ''is'' less than ''y''. Similarly, using the convention that ⊂ is proper subset, if {{nowrap|''A'' ⊆ ''B''}}, then ''A'' may or may not equal ''B'', but if {{nowrap|''A'' ⊂ ''B''}}, then ''A'' definitely does not equal ''B''.

== Examples ==
[[File:PolygonsSet EN.svg|thumb|The regular polygons form a subset of the polygons]]
* The set A = {1, 2} is a proper subset of B = {1, 2, 3}, thus both expressions A ⊆ B and A ⊊ B are true.
* The set D = {1, 2, 3} is a subset (but ''not'' a proper subset) of E = {1, 2, 3}, thus D ⊆ E is true, and D ⊊ E is not true (false).
* Any set is a subset of itself, but not a proper subset. (X ⊆ X is true, and X ⊊ X is false for any set X.)
* The [[empty set]] {&amp;nbsp;}, denoted by ∅, is also a subset of any given set ''X''. It is also always a proper subset of any set except itself.
* The set {''x'': ''x'' is a [[prime number]] greater than 10} is a proper subset of {''x'': ''x'' is an odd number greater than 10}
* The set of [[natural number]]s is a proper subset of the set of [[rational number]]s; likewise, the set of points in a [[line segment]] is a proper subset of the set of points in a [[line (mathematics)|line]]. These are two examples in which both the subset and the whole set are infinite, and the subset has the same [[cardinality#Infinite sets|cardinality]] (the concept that corresponds to size, that is, the number of elements, of a finite set) as the whole; such cases can run counter to one's initial intuition.
* The set of rational numbers is a proper subset of the set of [[real number]]s. In this example, both sets are infinite but the latter set has a larger cardinality (or ''power'') than the former set.

== Other properties of inclusion ==
[[File:Subset with expansion.svg|thumb|A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C imply A ⊆ C]]
Inclusion is the canonical [[partial order]] in the sense that every partially ordered set (''X'', &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;) is [[isomorphic]] to some collection of sets ordered by inclusion. The [[ordinal number]]s are a simple example—if each ordinal ''n'' is identified with the set [''n''] of all ordinals less than or equal to ''n'', then ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if [''a''] ⊆ [''b''].

For the [[power set]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(S)&lt;/math&gt; of a set ''S'', the inclusion partial order is (up to an [[order isomorphism]]) the [[Cartesian product]] of ''k'' = |''S''| (the [[cardinality]] of ''S'') copies of the partial order on {0,1} for which 0 &amp;lt; 1. This can be illustrated by enumerating ''S'' = {''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} and associating with each subset ''T'' ⊆ ''S'' (which is to say with each element of 2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;) the ''k''-tuple from {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; of which the ''i''th coordinate is 1 if and only if ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a member of ''T''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60578">'''Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics''' or '''stochastics''' ('''STS''') is an exact theory of [[Stochastic differential equation|stochastic (partial) differential equations]] (SDEs), the class of mathematical models with the widest applicability covering, in particular, all continuous time [[dynamical system]]s, with and without noise. The main utility of the theory from the physical point of view is a rigorous theoretical explanation of the ubiquitous spontaneous long-range dynamical behavior that manifests itself across disciplines via such phenomena as [[Pink noise|1/f]], [[Flicker noise|flicker]], and [[crackling noise|crackling]] noises and the power-law statistics, or [[Zipf's law]], of instantonic processes like earthquakes and neuroavalanches. From the mathematical point of view, STS is interesting because it bridges the two major parts of mathematical physics – the [[dynamical systems theory]] and [[Topological quantum field theories|topological field theories]]. Besides these and related disciplines such as [[algebraic topology]] and [[Quantum field theory|supersymmetric field theories]], STS is also connected with the traditional theory of [[stochastic differential equation]]s and the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators.

The theory begun with the application of [[BRST quantization|BRST]] gauge fixing procedure to Langevin SDEs,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; that was later adapted to [[classical mechanics]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niemi|first=A.

The main idea of the theory is to study, instead of trajectories, the SDE-defined temporal evolution of [[differential form]]s. This evolution has an intrinsic BRST or topological supersymmetry representing the preservation of topology and/or the concept of proximity in the [[phase space]] by continuous time dynamics. The theory identifies a model as [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], in the generalized, stochastic sense, if its ground state is not supersymmetric, i.e., if the supersymmetry is broken spontaneously. Accordingly, the emergent long-range behavior that always accompanies dynamical chaos and its derivatives such as [[turbulence]] and [[self-organized criticality]] can be understood as a consequence of the [[Goldstone theorem]].

== History and relation to other theories ==

The first relation between supersymmetry and stochastic dynamics was established by [[Giorgio Parisi]] and Nicolas Sourlas&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parisi|first=G.|last2=Sourlas|first2=N.|date=1979|title=Random Magnetic Fields, Supersymmetry, and Negative Dimensions|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=43|issue=11|pages=744–745|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.43.744|bibcode=1979PhRvL..43..744P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parisi|first=G.|title=Supersymmetric field theories and stochastic differential equations|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0550321382905387|journal=Nuclear Physics B|language=en|volume=206|issue=2|pages=321–332|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(82)90538-7|year=1982|bibcode=1982NuPhB.206..321P}}&lt;/ref&gt; who demonstrated that the application of the [[BRST quantization|BRST]] gauge fixing procedure to Langevin SDEs, i.e., to SDEs with linear phase spaces, gradient flow vector fields, and additive noises, results in N=2 supersymmetric models.

Real dynamical systems, however, are never purely Langevin or classical mechanical. In addition, physically meaningful Langevin SDEs never break supersymmetry spontaneously. Therefore, for the purpose of the identification of the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking as [[Chaos theory|dynamical chaos]], the generalization of the Parisi-Sourlas approach to SDEs of general form is needed. This generalization could come only after a rigorous formulation of the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mostafazadeh|first=A.|date=2002-07-19|title=Pseudo-Hermiticity versus PT-symmetry III: Equivalence of pseudo-Hermiticity and the presence of antilinear symmetries|journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics|volume=43|issue=8|pages=3944–3951|doi=10.1063/1.1489072|issn=0022-2488|bibcode=2002JMP....43.3944M|arxiv=math-ph/0203005}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the stochastic evolution operator is pseudo-Hermitian in the general case. Such generalization&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; showed that all SDEs possess N=1 BRST or topological supersymmetry (TS) and this finding completes the story of relation between supersymmetry and SDEs.

In parallel to the BRST procedure approach to SDEs, mathematicians working in the [[dynamical systems theory]] introduced and studied the concept of generalized transfer operator defined for random dynamical systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=Dynamical Zeta Functions and Transfer Operators|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200208/fea-ruelle.pdf|journal=Notices of the AMS|volume=49|issue=8|pages=887|author=Reulle, D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruelle|first=D.|date=1990-12-01|title=An extension of the theory of Fredholm determinants|journal=Publications Mathématiques de l'Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques|language=en|volume=72|issue=1|pages=175–193|doi=10.1007/bf02699133|issn=0073-8301}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept underlies the most important object of the STS, the stochastic evolution operator, and provides it with a solid mathematical meaning.

== Parisi–Sourlas approach to Langevin SDEs ==
In the context of supersymmetric approach to stochastic dynamics, the term Langevin SDEs denotes SDEs with Euclidean phase space, &lt;math&gt; X = \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt;, gradient flow vector field, and additive [[Gaussian process|Gaussian]] [[white noise]],

&lt;math display="block"&gt; \dot x(t) = - \partial U(x(t))+(2\Theta)^{1/2} \xi(t),&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt; x\in X &lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt; \xi \in \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt;is the noise variable, &lt;math&gt; \Theta &lt;/math&gt; is the noise intensity, and &lt;math&gt; \partial U(x)&lt;/math&gt;, which in coordinates &lt;math&gt; (\partial U(x))^i \equiv \delta^{ij}\partial_jU(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \partial_i U(x) \equiv \partial U(x)/\partial x^i&lt;/math&gt;, is the gradient flow vector field with &lt;math&gt; U(x)&lt;/math&gt; being the Langevin function often interpreted as the energy of the purely dissipative stochastic dynamical system.

The Parisi-Sourlas method is a way of construction of the [[Path integral formulation|path integral]] representation of the Langevin SDE. It can be thought of as a [[BRST quantization|BRST]] gauge fixing procedure that uses the Langevin SDE as a gauge condition. Namely, one considers the following functional integral,

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
{\mathcal W} = \left\langle\int \dots \int J \left(\prod\nolimits_\tau \delta(\dot x(\tau) - {\mathcal F}(x(\tau)))\right)Dx \right\rangle_\text{noise} ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt; \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; denotes the r.h.s. of the Langevin SDE, &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \langle \cdot \rangle_\text{noise} \equiv \int \dots \int \cdot P(\xi) D\xi &lt;/math&gt; is the operation of stochastic averaging with &lt;math&gt; P(\xi) \propto e^{- \int_{t'}^t d\tau \xi^2(\tau)/2} &lt;/math&gt; being the normalized distribution of noise configurations,

&lt;math&gt; 
\textstyle J = \operatorname{Det} \frac{\delta(\dot x (\tau) - {\mathcal F} (x(\tau)))}{\delta x (\tau')}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the Jacobian of the corresponding functional derivative, and the path integration is over all closed paths, &lt;math&gt; x(t)=x(t') &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; t'&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; t&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt;are the initial and final moments of temporal evolution.

=== Topological interpretation ===
Topological aspects of the Parisi-Sourlas construction can be briefly outlined in the following manner.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The delta-functional, i.e., the collection of the infinite number of delta-functions, ensures that only solutions of the Langevin SDE contribute to &lt;math&gt; \mathcal W&lt;/math&gt;. In the context of BRST procedure, these solutions can be viewed as [[Gribov copies]]. Each solution contributes either positive or negative unity: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
{\mathcal W} = \textstyle \left\langle I_N(\xi)\right\rangle_\text{noise}
&lt;/math&gt;with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
I_N(\xi) = \sum_\text{solutions} \operatorname{sign}J
&lt;/math&gt;  being the index of the so-called Nicolai map, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \xi = (\dot x + \partial U)/(2\Theta)^{1/2} &lt;/math&gt;, which in this case is the map from the space of closed paths in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
X
&lt;/math&gt; to the space of noise configurations, a map that provides a noise configuration at which a given closed path is a solution of the Langevin SDE. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
I_N(\xi)
&lt;/math&gt; can be viewed as a realization of [[Poincaré–Hopf theorem]] on the infinite-dimensional space of close paths with the Langevin SDE playing the role of the vector field and with the solutions of Langevin SDE playing the role of the critical points with index &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{sign}J
&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
I_N(\xi)
&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the noise configuration because it is of topological character. The same it true for its stochastic average, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal W&lt;/math&gt;, which is not the partition function of the model but, instead, its [[Witten index]].

=== Path integral representation ===
With the help of a standard field theoretic technique that involves introduction of additional field called Lagrange multiplier, &lt;math&gt; B&lt;/math&gt;, and a pair of fermionic fields called [[Faddeev–Popov ghost]]s,  &lt;math&gt; \chi, \bar\chi&lt;/math&gt;, the Witten index can be given the following form,

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
{\mathcal W} = \int\dots\int_{p.b.c.} e^{(Q,\Psi)}D\Phi,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt; denotes collection of all the fields, p.b.c. stands for periodic boundary conditions, the so-called gauge fermion, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Psi = \int_{t'}^td\tau (\imath_{\dot x} - \bar d)(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \imath_{\dot x} = i \bar\chi_j\dot x^j &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \textstyle \bar d = - i \bar\chi_j\delta^{jk}(\partial_kU + \Theta  i B_k)&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[BRST quantization|BRST symmetry]] defined via its action on arbitrary functional &lt;math&gt;A(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; (Q, A(\Phi)) = \textstyle \int _{t'}^td\tau(\chi^i(\tau)\delta/\delta x^i(\tau) + B_i(\tau)\delta/\delta \bar\chi_i(\tau)) A(\Phi) &lt;/math&gt;. In the [[BRST quantization|BRST]] formalism, the Q-exact pieces like, &lt;math&gt;(Q,\Psi)&lt;/math&gt;, serve as gauge fixing tools. Therefore, the path integral expression for &lt;math&gt; \mathcal W&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as a model whose action contains nothing else but the gauge fixing term. This is a definitive feature of [[topological quantum field theory|Witten-type topological field theories]] and in this particular case of BRST procedure approach to SDEs, the BRST symmetry can be also recognized as the topological supersymmetry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A common way to explain the BRST procedure is to say that the BRST symmetry generates the fermionic version of the gauge transformations, whereas its overall effect on the path integral is to limit the integration only to configurations that satisfy a specified gauge condition. This interpretation also applies to Parisi-Sourlas approach with the deformations of the trajectory and the Langevin SDE playing the roles of the gauge transformations and the gauge condition respectively.

=== Operator representation ===
Physical fermions in the high-energy physics and condensed matter models have antiperiodic boundary conditions in time. The unconventional periodic boundary conditions for fermions in the path integral expression for the Witten index is the origin of the topological character of this object. These boundary conditions reveal themselves in the operator representation of the Witten index as the alternating sign operator,&lt;math display="block"&gt;
{\mathcal W}  = \operatorname{Tr}(-1)^{\hat n} \hat {\mathcal M}_{tt'},
&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\hat n &lt;/math&gt;  is the operator of the number of ghosts/fermions and the finite-time stochastic evolution operator (SEO), &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \hat{\mathcal M }_{tt'} = e^{- (t-t')\hat H }&lt;/math&gt;, where, &lt;math display="block"&gt; \hat H = \hat L_{-\partial U} - \Theta \hat \triangle= [\hat d, \hat{\bar d}],&lt;/math&gt;is the infinitesimal SEO with &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{L} &lt;/math&gt; being the Lie derivative along the subscript vector field, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \hat \triangle&lt;/math&gt; being the Laplacian, &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{d} = \chi^i \partial/\partial x^i &lt;/math&gt; being the [[exterior derivative]], which is the operator representative of the TS, and  &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{\bar d} = - (i\hat{\bar\chi}_i) \delta^{ij} ( \partial_jU + \Theta (i\hat B_j)) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;i {\hat B}_j = \partial/ \partial x^j&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;i{\hat{\bar \chi}}_j = \partial/ \partial \chi^j&lt;/math&gt; are bosonic and fermionic momenta, and with square brackets denoting bi-graded commutator, i.e., it is an anticommutator if both operators are fermionic (contain odd total number of &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt;'s and &lt;math&gt; \hat {\bar \chi} &lt;/math&gt;'s) and a commutator otherwise. The exterior derivative and &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{\bar d} &lt;/math&gt; are [[supercharge]]s. They are [[nilpotent]], e.g., &lt;math&gt;\hat d^2=0&lt;/math&gt;, and commutative with the SEO. In other words, Langevin SDEs possess N=2 supersymmetry. The fact that &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{\bar d} &lt;/math&gt; is a supercharge is accidental. For SDEs of arbitrary form, this is not true.

=== Hilbert space ===
The wavefunctions are functions not only of the bosonic variables, &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, but also of the [[Grassmann number]]s or fermions, &lt;math&gt;\chi\in TX&lt;/math&gt;, from the tangent space of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The wavefunctions can be viewed as [[differential form]]s on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with the fermions playing the role of the differentials &lt;math&gt;\chi\equiv dx\wedge&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The concept of infinitesimal SEO generalizes the [[Fokker–Planck equation|Fokker–Planck operator]], which is essentially the SEO acting on top differential forms that have the meaning of the total [[probability distribution]]s. Differential forms of lesser degree can be interpreted, at least locally on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, as [[conditional probability distribution]]s.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ovchinnikov|first=I.V.|date=2013-01-15|title=Topological field theory of dynamical systems.

== Relation to nonlinear sigma model and algebraic topology ==
In Ref.,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; a model has been introduced that can be viewed as a 1D prototype of the topological nonlinear sigma models (TNSM),&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; a subclass of the [[topological quantum field theory|Witten-type topological field theories]]. The 1D TNSM is defined for [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian phase spaces]] while for Euclidean phase spaces it reduces to the Parisi-Sourlas model. Its key difference from STS is the diffusion operator which is the [[Hodge Laplacian]] for 1D TNSM and &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat  L_{e_a} \hat  L_{e_a} &lt;/math&gt;for STS . This difference in unimportant in the context of relation between STS and algebraic topology, the relation established by the theory of 1D TNSM (see, e.g., Refs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;).

The model is defined by the following evolution operator &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \hat H = \hat L_{-\partial U} + \Theta[\hat d, \hat{d}^\dagger]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt; (\partial U)^i = g^{ij}\partial_j U&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math display="inline"&gt; g&lt;/math&gt; being the metric, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; [\hat d, \hat{d}^\dagger]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hodge Laplacian]], and the [[differential form]]s from the [[exterior algebra]] of the phase space, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \Omega(X)&lt;/math&gt;, are viewed as wavefunctions. There exists a similarity transformation, &lt;math&gt;\hat H \to {\hat H}_U = e^{U/2\Theta} \hat H e^{- U/2\Theta} &lt;/math&gt;, that brings the evolution operator to the explicitly Hermitian form &lt;math&gt;{\hat H}_U = \Theta [\hat d_U, \hat d_U^\dagger] &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\hat d_U = e^{U/2\Theta} \hat d e^{-U/2\Theta} = 
\chi^i(\partial/\partial x^i - \partial_i U /2\Theta)   &lt;/math&gt;. In the Euclidean case, &lt;math&gt;{\hat H}_U &lt;/math&gt; is the Hamiltonian of a N=2 [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]]. One can introduce two Hermitian operators, &lt;math&gt;\hat q_1 = (\hat d_U + \hat d_U^\dagger) /2^{1/2}   &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat q_2 = i (\hat d_U - \hat d_U^\dagger) /2^{1/2}   &lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;{\hat H}_U = \Theta \hat q_1^2 = \Theta \hat q_2^2 &lt;/math&gt; . This demonstrates that the spectrum of &lt;math&gt;{\hat H}_U &lt;/math&gt; and/or &lt;math&gt;{\hat H} &lt;/math&gt; is real and nonnegative. This is also true for SEOs of Langevin SDEs. For the SDEs of arbitrary form, however, this is no longer true as the eigenvalues of the SEO can be negative and even complex, which actually allows for the TS to be broken spontanenously.

The following properties of the evolution operator of 1D TNSM hold even for the SEO of the SDEs of arbitrary form. The evolution operator commutes with the operator of the degree of differential forms. As a result, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \hat H  = \hat H^{(\dim X)} \oplus \dots \oplus \hat H^{(0)} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat H^{(k)} = \hat H |_{\Omega^{(k)}} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Omega^{(n)}(X) &lt;/math&gt; is the space of differential forms of degree &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, due to the presence of TS, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \Omega(X)={\mathcal H} \oplus {\mathcal N} \oplus (\hat d {\mathcal N})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt; {\mathcal H}&lt;/math&gt; are the supersymmetric eigenstates, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \theta's&lt;/math&gt;, non-trivial in [[de Rham cohomology]] whereas the rest are the pairs of non-supersymmetric eigenstates of the form &lt;math display="inline"&gt; |\vartheta\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \hat d |\vartheta\rangle &lt;/math&gt;. All supersymmetric eigenstates have exactly zero eigenvalue and, barring accidental situations, all non-supersymmetric states have non-zero eigenvalues. Non-supersymmetric pairs of eigenstates do not contribute to the Witten index, which equals the difference in the numbers of the supersymmetric states of even and odd degrees, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
{\mathcal W}  = \#\{\text{even }\theta's\} - \#\{\text{odd }\theta's\}.
&lt;/math&gt;For compact &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, each de Rham cohomology class provides one supersymmetric eigenstate and the Witten index equals the Euler characteristic of the phase space.

==  BRST procedure for SDEs of arbitrary form ==
The Parisi-Sourlas method of BRST procedure approach to Langevin SDEs have also been adapted to classical mechanics,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; stochastic generalization of classical mechanics,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; higher order Langevin SDEs,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kleinert|first=H.|last2=Shabanov|first2=S. V.|date=1997-10-27|title=Supersymmetry in stochastic processes with higher-order time derivatives|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960197006609|journal=Physics Letters A|volume=235|issue=2|pages=105–112|doi=10.1016/s0375-9601(97)00660-9|via=|bibcode=1997PhLA..235..105K|arxiv=quant-ph/9705042}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, to SDEs of arbitrary form.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; While there exist standard techniques that allow to consider models with colored noises, higher-dimensional "base spaces" described by partial SDEs etc., the key elements of STS can be discussed using the following basic class of SDEs,   &lt;math display="block"&gt; \dot x(t) = F(x(t))+(2\Theta)^{1/2}e_a(x(t))\xi^a(t),&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x\in X &lt;/math&gt; is a point in the phase space assumed for simplicity a [[Closed manifold|closed]] [[topological manifold]], &lt;math&gt; F(x)\in TX_x &lt;/math&gt; is a sufficiently smooth [[vector field]], called flow vector field, from the [[tangent space]] of &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt; e_a \in TX, a=1, \ldots, \dim X &lt;/math&gt;  is a set of sufficiently smooth vector fields that specify how the system is coupled to the noise, which is called [[Additive noise|additive]]/[[Multiplicative noise|multiplicative]] depending on whether &lt;math&gt; e_a &lt;/math&gt;'s are independent/dependent on the position on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Ambiguity of path integral representation and Ito–Stratonovich dilemma ===
BRST gauge fixing procedure goes along the same lines as in case of Langevin SDEs. The topological interpretation of the BRST procedure is just the same and the path integral representation of the Witten index is defined by the gauge fermion, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Psi&lt;/math&gt;, given by the same expression but with the generalized version of&lt;math display="inline"&gt; \textstyle \bar d = \imath_{F} - \Theta \imath_{e_a} (Q,\imath_{e_a})&lt;/math&gt;. There is one important subtlety, however, that appears on the way to the operator representation of the model. Unlike for Langevin SDEs, classical mechanics, and other SDEs with additive noises, the path integral representation of the finite-time SEO is an ambiguous object. This ambiguity originates from non-commutativity of momenta and position operators, e.g., &lt;math&gt; \hat B \hat x \ne  \hat x \hat B &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, &lt;math&gt; B(\tau) x(\tau)  &lt;/math&gt; in the path integral representation has a whole one-parameter family of possible interpretations in the operator representation, &lt;math&gt; (\alpha \hat B \hat x + (1-\alpha)\hat x \hat B)|\psi(\tau)\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; |\psi(\tau)\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; denotes an arbitrary wavefunction. Accordingly, there is a whole &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-family of infinitesimal SEOs,   &lt;math display="block"&gt; \hat H_\alpha = \hat L_F - \Theta\hat L_{e_a} \hat L_{e_a}= [\hat d, \hat{\bar d}_\alpha],&lt;/math&gt;with  &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{\bar d}_\alpha = \hat{\imath}_{F_\alpha} - \Theta \hat{\imath}_{e_a}\hat  L_{e_a} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\imath}_{F_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[interior multiplication]] by the subscript vector field, and the "shifted" flow vector field being &lt;math&gt; \textstyle F_\alpha = F - \Theta(2\alpha-1)(e_a\cdot\partial) e_a &lt;/math&gt;. Noteworthy, unlike in Langevin SDEs, &lt;math&gt;\hat {\bar d}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is not a [[supercharge]] and STS cannot be identified as a N=2 supersymmetric theory in the general case.

The path integral representation of stochastic dynamics is equivalent to the traditional understanding of SDEs as of a continuous time limit of [[stochastic difference equation]]s where different choices of parameter &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; are called "interpretations" of SDEs. The choice &lt;math&gt; \alpha=1/2  &lt;/math&gt;, for which &lt;math&gt; \textstyle F_{1/2} = F &lt;/math&gt; and which is known in quantum theory as [[Wigner–Weyl transform|Weyl symmetrization]] rule, is known as the [[Stratonovich integral|Stratonovich interpretation]], whereas &lt;math&gt; \alpha=1  &lt;/math&gt; as the [[Itô calculus|Ito interpretation]]. While in quantum theory the Weyl symmetrization is preferred because it guaranties hermiticity of Hamiltonians, in STS the Weyl-Stratonovich approach is preferred because it corresponds to the most natural mathematical meaning of the finite-time SEO discussed [[Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics#Supersymmetric theory of SDEs without BRST quantization|below]]—the stochastically averaged pullback induced by the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms.

=== Eigensystem of stochastic evolution operator ===

[[File:Possible types of spectra of SEO of STS 3 sphere.png|thumb|The three possible types of SEO spectra on a 3D sphere.

For types '''b''' and '''c''', the (fastest growing) ground (eigen)states are non-supersymmetric because they have non-zero eigenvalues. TS is broken spontaneously. Vertical arrowed lines visualize supersymmetry operator.]]

As compared to the SEO of Langevin SDEs, the SEO of a general form SDE is pseudo-Hermitian.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As a result, the eigenvalues of non-supersymmetric eigenstates are not restricted to be real positive, whereas the eigenvalues of supersymmetric eigenstates are still exactly zero. Just like for Langevin SDEs and nonlinear sigma model, the structure of the eigensystem of the SEO reestablishes the topological character of the Witten index: the contributions from the non-supersymmetric pairs of eigenstates vanish and only supersymmetric states contribute the [[Euler characteristic]] of (closed) &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt;. Among other properties of the SEO spectra is that &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat H^{(\operatorname{dim} X)} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat H^{(0)} &lt;/math&gt; never break TS, i.e., &lt;math&gt; \textstyle Re (\operatorname{spec} \hat H^{(\operatorname{dim} X)}) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, there are three major types of the SEO spectra presented in the figure on the right. The two types that have negative (real parts of) eigenvalues correspond to the spontaneously broken TS.  All types of the SEO spectra are realizable as can be established, e.g., from the exact relation between the theory of [[Dynamo theory#Kinematic dynamo theory|kinematic dynamo]] and STS.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==  STS without BRST procedure   ==
===  The mathematical meaning of stochastic evolution operator  ===
The finite-time SEO can be obtained in another, more mathematical way based on the idea to study the SDE-induced actions on differential forms directly, without going through the BRST gauge fixing procedure. The so-obtained finite-time SEO is known in [[dynamical systems theory]] as the generalized transfer operator&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; and it has also been used in the classical theory of SDEs (see, e.g., Refs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stochastic differential geometry at Saint-Flour|last=Ancona|first=A.|last2=Elworthy|first2=K. D.|last3=Emery|first3=M.|last4=Kunita|first4=H.|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642341700|location=|pages=|oclc=811000422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stochastic flows and stochastic differential equations|last=Kunita|first=H.|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521599252|location=|pages=|oclc=36864963}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). The contribution to this construction from STS&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; is the exposition of the supersymmetric structure underlying it and establishing its relation to the BRST procedure for SDEs.

Namely, for any configuration of the noise, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, and an initial condition, &lt;math&gt;x(t')=x'\in X&lt;/math&gt;, SDE defines a unique solution/trajectory, &lt;math&gt;x(t)\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Even for noise configurations that are non-differentiable with respect to time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is differentiable with respect to the initial condition, &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slavík|first=A.|title=Generalized differential equations: Differentiability of solutions with respect to initial conditions and parameters|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022247X13000449|journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications|language=en|volume=402|issue=1|pages=261–274|doi=10.1016/j.jmaa.2013.01.027|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, SDE defines the family of the noise-configuration-dependent [[diffeomorphism]]s of the phase space to itself, &lt;math&gt;M_{tt'}:X\to X&lt;/math&gt;. This object can be understood as a collection and/or definition of all the noise-configuration-dependent trajectories, &lt;math&gt;x(t) = M_{tt'}(x')&lt;/math&gt;. The diffeomorphisms induce actions or [[Pullback (differential geometry)#Pullback of differential forms|pullbacks]], &lt;math&gt; \textstyle M^*_{t't}:\Omega(X)\to\Omega(X) &lt;/math&gt;. Unlike, say, trajectories in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, pullbacks are linear objects even for nonlinear &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Linear objects can be averaged and averaging &lt;math&gt; M^*_{t't}&lt;/math&gt; over the noise configurations, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, results in the finite-time SEO which is unique and corresponds to the Weyl-Stratonovich interpretation of the BRST procedure approach to SDEs, &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathcal M }_{tt'} = \langle M^*_{t't} \rangle_\text{noise}=e^{-(t-t')\hat H_{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Within this definition of the finite-time SEO, the Witten index can be recognized as the sharp trace of the generalized transfer operator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  It also links the Witten index to the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem|Lefschetz index]],&lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\textstyle I_L=\operatorname{Tr} (-1)^{\hat n} M_{t't}^*= \sum_{x\in \operatorname{fix} M_{tt'}} \operatorname{sign} \operatorname{det} (\delta_j^i -\partial M_{tt'}^i(x) /\partial x^j)
&lt;/math&gt;, a topological constant that equals the [[Euler characteristic]] of the (closed) phase space. Namely, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\textstyle {\mathcal W} = \operatorname{Tr} (-1)^{\hat n} \langle M_{t't}^* \rangle_\text{noise} = \langle \operatorname{Tr} (-1)^{\hat n} M_{t't}^* \rangle_\text{noise} = I_{L}
&lt;/math&gt;.

===  The meaning of supersymmetry and the butterfly effect ===
The N=2 supersymmetry of Langevin SDEs has been linked to the [[Onsager reciprocal relations|Onsager principle of microscopic reversibility]]&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; and [[Jarzynski equality]].&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; In classical mechanics, a relation between the corresponding N=2 supersymmetry and [[ergodicity]] has been proposed.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; In general form SDEs, where physical arguments may not be applicable, a lower level explanation of the TS is available. This explanation is based on understanding of the finite-time SEO as a stochastically averaged pullback of the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms (see subsection above). In this picture, the question of why any SDE has TS is the same as the question of why [[exterior derivative]] commutes with the pullback of any diffeomorphism. The answer to this question is differentiability of the corresponding map.  In other words, the presence of TS is the algebraic version of the statement that continuous-time flow preserves continuity of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Two initially close points will remain close during evolution, which is just yet another way of saying that &lt;math&gt;M_{tt'}&lt;/math&gt; is a diffeomorphism.

In deterministic chaotic models, initially close points can part in the limit of infinitely long temporal evolution. This is the famous [[butterfly effect]], which is equivalent to the statement that &lt;math&gt;M_{tt'}&lt;/math&gt; losses differentiability in this limit. In algebraic representation of dynamics, the evolution in the infinitely long time limit is described by the ground state of the SEO and the butterfly effect is equivalent to the spontaneous breakdown of TS, i.e., to the situation when the ground state is not supersymmetric. Noteworthy, unlike traditional understanding of deterministic chaotic dynamics, the spontaneous breakdown of TS works also for stochastic cases. This is the most important generalization because deterministic dynamics is, in fact, a mathematical idealization. Real dynamical systems cannot be isolated from their environments and thus always experience stochastic influence.

== Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and dynamical chaos ==

BRST gauge fixing procedure applied to SDEs leads directly to the Witten index. The Witten index is of topological character and it does not respond to any perturbation. In particular, all response correlators calculated using the Witten index vanish. This fact has a physical interpretation within the STS: the physical meaning of the Witten index is the partition function of the noise&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and since there is no backaction from the dynamical system to the noise, the Witten index has no information on the details of the SDE. In contrast, the information on the details of the model is contained in the other trace-like object of the theory, the dynamical partition function, &lt;math display="block"&gt; {\mathcal Z}_{tt'} = \int\dots\int_{a.p.b.c.} e^{(Q,\Psi)}D\Phi = \operatorname{Tr} \hat {\mathcal M}_{tt'},&lt;/math&gt;where a.p.b.c. denotes antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermionic fields and periodic boundary conditions for bosonic fields. In the standard manner, the dynamical partition function can be promoted to the [[generating function]]al by coupling the model to external probing fields.

For a wide class of models, dynamical partition function provides lower bound for the stochastically averaged number of fixed points of the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms,&lt;math display="block"&gt; \left.{\mathcal Z}_{tt'}\right|_{t-t'\to\infty} = \sum\nolimits_{p} e^{-(t-t'){\mathsf E}_p} \le  \langle 
\#\{\text{fixed points of } M_{t't}\} \rangle_\text{noise} \propto e^{(t-t')S} .&lt;/math&gt;Here, index &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; runs over "physical states", i.e., the eigenstates that grow fastest with the rate of the exponential growth given as,&lt;math display="inline"&gt; \Gamma_g = - \min_\alpha \operatorname{Re} {\mathsf E}_\alpha \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;, and parameter &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; can be viewed as stochastic version of dynamical entropy such as [[topological entropy]]. Positive entropy is one of the key signatures of deterministic chaos. Therefore, the situation with positive &lt;math&gt; \Gamma_g &lt;/math&gt; must be identified as chaotic in the generalized, stochastic sense as it implies positive entropy: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; \Gamma_g \le S &lt;/math&gt;. At the same time, positive &lt;math&gt; \Gamma_g &lt;/math&gt; implies that TS is broken spontaneously, that is, the ground state in not supersymmetric because its eigenvalue is not zero. In other words, positive dynamical entropy is a reason to identify spontaneous TS breaking as the stochastic generalization of the concept of dynamical chaos. Noteworthy, Langevin SDEs are never chaotic because the spectrum of their SEO is real non-negative.

The complete list of reasons why spontaneous TS breaking must be viewed as the stochastic generalization of the concept of dynamical chaos is as follows. 
* Positive dynamical entropy.
* According to the [[Goldstone's theorem]], spontaneous TS breaking must tailor a long-range dynamical behavior, one of the manifestations of which is the [[butterfly effect]] discussed above in the context of the meaning of TS.
* From the properties of the eigensystem of SEO, TS can be spontaneously broken only if &lt;math&gt; \dim X \ge 3 &lt;/math&gt;. This conclusion can be viewed as the stochastic generalization of the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem|Poincare–Bendixson theorem]] for deterministic chaos.
* In the deterministic case, [[Integrable system|integrable models in the sense of dynamical systems]] have well-defined global  [[Stable manifold|stable and unstable manifolds]] of &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt;. The bras/kets of the global ground states of such models are the Poincare duals of the global stable/unstable manifolds. These ground states are supersymmetric so that TS is not broken spontaneously. On the contrary, when the model is non-integrable or chaotic, its global (un)stable manifolds are not well-defined topological manifolds, but rather have a fractal, self-recurrent structure that can be captured using the concept of branching manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The topology of chaos : Alice in stretch and squeezeland|last=Gilmore|first=R.|last2=Lefranc|first2=M.|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=9783527410675|location=|pages=|oclc=967841676}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wavefunctions that can represent such manifolds cannot be supersymmetric. Therefore, TS breaking is intrinsically related to the concept of non-integrability in the sense of dynamical systems, which is actually yet another widely accepted definition of deterministic chaos.
All the above features of TS breaking work for both deterministic and stochastic models. This is in contrast with the traditional [[Chaos theory|deterministic chaos]] whose trajectory-based properties such as the [[topological mixing]] cannot in principle be generalized to stochastic case because, just like in quantum dynamics, all trajectories are possible in the presence of noise and, say, the topological mixing property is satisfied trivially by all models with non-zero noise intensity.

[[File:STS Explanation of Instanton Matrix Element.png|thumb|The square '''acbd''' represents an instanton, i.e, the family of trajectories of deterministic flow (dotted arrowed curves) leading from one critical point (b) to another (a). The bra/ket (&lt;math&gt;\langle a|&lt;/math&gt;/&lt;math&gt;|b\rangle&lt;/math&gt;) of the locally supersymmetric ground states (vacua) corresponding to these critical points are the Poincare duals of the local unstable/stable manifolds. Operators &lt;math&gt;\hat O_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt; are Poincare duals of vertical/horizontal lines. The value of the instantonic matrix element is the intersection number (the difference in the numbers of positive (black) and negative (white) intersections). It is invariant under the temporal evolution due to the flow, &lt;math&gt;\hat O_1(0) \to \hat O_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; .|alt=Instantoic matrix elemtent as an intersention number]]The topological sector of STS can be recognized as a member of the Witten-type [[Topological quantum field theory|topological field theories]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In other words, some objects in STS are of topological character with the Witten index being the most famous example. There are other classes of topological objects. One class of objects is related to [[instanton]]s, i.e., transient dynamics. Crumpling paper, protein folding, and many other nonlinear dynamical processes in response to quenches, i.e., to external (sudden) changes of parameters, can be recognized as instantonic dynamics. From the mathematical point of view, instantons are families of solutions of deterministic equations of motion, &lt;math&gt;\dot x = F &lt;/math&gt;, that lead from, say, less stable fixed point of &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt; to a more stable fixed point. Certain matrix elements calculated on instantons are of topological nature. An example of such matrix elements can be defined for a pair of critical points, &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; being more stable than &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math display="block"&gt; \left.\int\dots\int_{x(\pm\infty)=a,b} \left(\prod\nolimits_i O_i(t_i)\right)e^{({\mathcal Q},\Psi)} D\Phi  \right|_{\Theta\to0} = \langle a | {\mathcal T}\left(\prod\nolimits_i \hat O_i(t_i)\right) | b \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;Here &lt;math&gt; \langle a | &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; | b \rangle &lt;/math&gt; are the bra and ket of the corresponding perturbative supersymmetric ground states, or vacua, which are the Poincare duals of the local stable and unstable manifolds of the corresponding critical point; &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal T} &lt;/math&gt; denotes chronological ordering; &lt;math&gt; O &lt;/math&gt;'s are observables that are the Poincare duals of some closed submanifolds in &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt; \hat O(t) = \hat {\mathcal M}_{t_0 t} \hat O \hat {\mathcal M}_{t, t_0} &lt;/math&gt; are the observables in the Heisenberg representation with &lt;math&gt; t_0 &lt;/math&gt; being an unimportant reference time moment. The critical points have different indexes of stability so that the states &lt;math&gt;|a\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|b\rangle &lt;/math&gt; are topologically inequivalent as they represent unstable manifolds of different dimensionalities. The above matrix elements are independent of &lt;math&gt; t_i's &lt;/math&gt; as they actually represent the intersection number of &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;-manifolds on the instanton as exemplified in the figure.

The above instantonic matrix elements are exact only in the deterministic limit. In the general stochastic case, one can consider global supersymmetric states, &lt;math&gt; \theta&lt;/math&gt;'s, from the [[De Rham cohomology]] classes of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and observables, &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt;, that are Poincare duals of [[closed manifold]]s non-trivial in [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The following matrix elements, &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \langle \theta_\alpha | {\mathcal T}\left(\prod\nolimits_i \hat \gamma_i(t_i)\right) | \theta_\beta \rangle, &lt;/math&gt; are topological invariants representative of the structure of De Rham [[cohomology ring]] of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==
Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics can be interesting in different ways. For example, STS offers a promising realization of the concept of [[supersymmetry]]. In general, there are two major problems in the context of supersymmetry. The first is establishing connections between this mathematical entity and the real world. Within STS, supersymmetry is the most common symmetry in nature because it is pertinent to all continuous time dynamical systems. The second is the [[Supersymmetry breaking|spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry]]. This problem is particularly important for particle physics because supersymmetry of [[elementary particle]]s, if exists at extremely short scale, must be broken spontaneously at large scale. This problem is nontrivial because supersymmetries are hard to break spontaneously, the very reason behind the introduction of [[Soft SUSY breaking|soft or explicit supersymmetry breaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=D. J. H.|last2=Everett|first2=L. L.|last3=Kane|first3=G. L.|last4=King|first4=S. F.|last5=Lykken|first5=J.|last6=Wang|first6=Lian-Tao|date=2005-02-01|title=The soft supersymmetry-breaking Lagrangian: theory and applications|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157304004466|journal=Physics Reports|volume=407|issue=1–3|pages=1–203|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2004.08.032|bibcode=2005PhR...407....1C|arxiv=hep-ph/0312378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within STS, spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry is indeed a nontrivial dynamical phenomenon that has been variously known across disciplines as [[Chaos theory|chaos]], [[turbulence]], [[self-organized criticality]] etc.

A few more specific applications of STS are as follows.

=== Classification of stochastic dynamics ===

[[File:STS Phase Diagram.png|thumb|Stochastic dynamical systems can be classified according to whether TS is spontaneously broken or not (ordered/symmetric) and whether the flow vector field is integrable or non-integrable (chaotic). Symmetric phase can be identified as thermal equilibrium (T). Ordered non-integrable phase can be called chaos (C) because it hosts conventional deterministic chaos. Ordered integrable phase can be called noise-induced chaos (N) because TS broking involves antiinstantons that disappear in the deterministic limit. The N''-''phase is also known in the literature as self-organized criticality.]]

STS provides classification for stochastic models depending on whether TS is broken and integrability of flow vector field. In can be exemplified as a part of the general phase diagram at the [[Edge of chaos|border of chaos]] (see figure on the right). The phase diagram has the following properties:   
* For physical models, TS gets restored eventually with the increase of noise intensity. 
* Symmetric phase can be called thermal equilibrium or T-phase because the ground state is the supersymmetric state of steady-state total probability distribution. 
* In the deterministic limit, ordered phase is equivalent to deterministic chaotic dynamics with non-integrable flow. 
* Ordered non-integrable phase can be called chaos or C-phase because ordinary deterministic chaos belongs to it. 
* Ordered integrable phase can be called noise-induced chaos or N-phase because it disappears in the deterministic limit. TS is broken by the condensation of (anti-)instantons (see below).   
* At stronger noises, the sharp N-C boundary must smear out into a crossover because (anti-)instantons lose their individuality and it is hard for an external observer to tell one tunneling process from another.

=== Demystification of self-organized criticality ===
Many sudden (or instantonic) processes in nature, such as, e.g., [[crackling noise]], exhibit scale-free statistics often called the [[Zipf's law]]. As an explanation for this peculiar spontaneous dynamical behavior, it was proposed to believe that some stochastic dynamical systems have a tendency to self-tune themselves into a [[Critical point (physics)|critical point]], the phenomenological approach known as [[self-organized criticality]] (SOC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watkins|first=N.

Specifically, the definitive feature of the N-phase is the peculiar mechanism of the TS breaking. Unlike in the C-phase, where the TS is broken by the non-integrability of the flow, in the ''N''-phase, the TS is spontaneously broken due to the condensation of the configurations of instantons and noise-induced antiinstantons, i.e., time-reversed instantons. These processes can be roughly interpreted as the noise-induced tunneling events between, e.g., different attractors. Qualitatively, the dynamics in the ''N''-phase appears to an external observer as a sequence of sudden jumps or "avalanches" that must exhibit a scale-free behavior/statistics as a result of the [[Goldstone theorem]]. This picture of dynamics in the N-phase is exactly the dynamical behavior that the concept of SOC was designed to explain. In contrast with the original understanding of SOC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bak|first=P.|last2=Tang|first2=C.|last3=Wiesenfeld|first3=K.|date=1987|title=Self-organized criticality: An explanation of the 1/f noise|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=59|issue=4|pages=381–384|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381|pmid=10035754|bibcode=1987PhRvL..59..381B}}&lt;/ref&gt; its STS interpretation has little to do with the traditional [[critical phenomena]] theory where scale-free behavior is associated with unstable fixed points of the [[renormalization group]] flow.

=== Kinematic dynamo theory ===
Magnetohydrodynamical phenomenon of  [[Dynamo theory#Kinematic dynamo theory|kinematic dynamo]] can also be identified as the spontaneous breakdown of TS.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ovchinnikov|first=I.V.|last2=Ensslin|first2=T. A.|date=2016|title=Kinematic dynamo, supersymmetry breaking, and chaos|journal=Physical Review D|volume=93|issue=8|pages=085023|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.93.085023|bibcode=2016PhRvD..93h5023O|arxiv=1512.01651}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result follows from equivalence between the evolution operator of the magnetic field and the SEO of the corresponding SDE describing the flow of the background matter. The so emerged ''STS-kinematic dynamo'' correspondence proves, in particular, that both types of TS breaking spectra are possible, with the real and complex ground state eigenvalues, because kinematic dynamo with both types of the fastest growing eigenmodes are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bouya|first=I.|last2=Dormy|first2=E.|date=2013-03-01|title=Revisiting the ABC flow dynamo|journal=Physics of Fluids|volume=25|issue=3|pages=037103–037103–10|doi=10.1063/1.4795546|issn=1070-6631|bibcode=2013PhFl...25c7103B|arxiv=1206.5186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transient dynamics ===
It is well known that various types of transient dynamics, such as quenches, exhibit spontaneous long-range behavior. In case of quenches across phase transitions, this behavior is often attributed to the proximity of criticality. At the same time, other quenches, not across a phase transition, are also known to exhibit long-range characteristics with the best known examples being the [[Barkhausen effect]] and other realizations of the concept of [[crackling noise]]. It is intuitively appealing that theoretical explanation for the scale-free behavior in quenches must be the same disregard whether the quench is across a phase transition or not. STS offers such an explanation. Namely, transient dynamics is essentially a composite instanton and TS is intrinsically broken within instantons. Even though TS breaking within instantons is not exactly the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of a symmetry by a global ground state, this effective TS breaking must also result in a scale-free behavior. This understanding is supported by the fact that condensed instantons lead to appearance of logarithms in the correlation functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frenkel|first=E.|last2=Losev|first2=A.|last3=Nekrasov|first3=N.|title=Notes on instantons in topological field theory and beyond|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920563207004161|journal=Nuclear Physics B: Proceedings Supplements|language=en|volume=171|pages=215–230|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2007.06.013|year=2007|bibcode=2007NuPhS.171..215F|arxiv=hep-th/0702137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This picture of transient dynamics explains computational efficiency of the digital memcomputing machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Ventra|first=M.|last2=Traversa|first2=F.

=== Low energy effective theories for dynamical chaos  ===
In physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking is known as "ordering". For example, the spontaneous breakdown of translational symmetry in a liquid is the mathematical essence of crystallization or spatial "ordering" of molecules into a lattice. Therefore, spontaneous TS breaking picture of chaotic dynamics is in a certain sense opposite to the semantics of word "chaos". Due to its temporal character, it is actually [[Chronos]], not [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], that appears to be the [[Greek primordial deities|primordial Greek deity]] closest in its spirit to the TS breaking order. Perhaps, a more accurate identifier than "chaos" should be coined for TS breaking in the future. As of this moment, this qualitatively new understanding of dynamical chaos already points into a research direction that may lead to resolutions of some important problems such as turbulence and neurodynamics. Namely, as in case of any other "ordering", a simplified yet accurate description of chaotic dynamics can be achieved in terms of the low-energy effective theory for an [[Phase transitions#Order parameters|order parameter]]. While the low-energy [[Effective action|effective description]] of chaotic dynamics may be very case specific, its order parameter must always be a representative of the gapless fermions or goldstinos of the spontaneously broken TS.

'''Trashion''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "trash" and "fashion") is a term for art, jewellery, fashion and objects for the home created from used, thrown-out, found and repurposed elements.  The term was first coined in [[New Zealand]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://threadnz.com/fashion/fashion-shows/turn-your-trash-into-trashion "Turn your trash into 'trashion',"] Thread.co.nz, 2004. Retrieved 19 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and gained in usage through 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Scholtus, Petz. [http://www.treehugger.com/style/vaho-is-trashion.html "Vaho is Trashion,"] Treehugger.com, 6 June 2005. Retrieved 19 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Trashion is a subgenre of [[found object]] art, which is basically using objects that already have some other defined purpose, and turning it into art. In this case, trash is used.

Initially trashion was used to describe art-[[haute couture|couture]] costume usually linked to contests or fashion shows; however, as recycling and 'green' fashion become more prevalent, trashion has taken a turn for the more wearable.  The term is now widely used in creative circles to describe any wearable item or accessory that is constructed using all or part materials that have been recycled, including clothing that has been thrifted and reconditioned.

==Philosophy==
Trashion is a philosophy and an ethic encompassing [[environmentalism]] and [[innovation]]. Making traditional objects out of recycled materials can be trashion, as can making avant-garde fashion from cast-offs or junk.  It springs from a desire to make the best use of limited resources. Trashion is similar to [[upcycling]] and refashion, although it began with specific fashion aspirations.  Like upcycling, trashion generates items that are valued again, but these may be low-cost or high-cost, perhaps depending on the skill of the artist. The environmental aim of trashion is to call attention to the polluting outcome of waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Trashion' designer Marina DeBris turns ocean rubbish into high-end outfits – in pictures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/sep/13/trashion-designer-marina-debris-turns-ocean-rubbish-into-high-end-outfits-in-pictures|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=The Guardian|date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Indigenous people throughout the world have used salvaged materials to create new objects for an indeterminate number of years.  Africans have made bags from rice and juice packets, Haitians have made sculptural jewelry from old oil cans, and American settlers have made quilts and rugs from cast-off clothing and feed sacks.  People were making something from nothing long before the word "trashion" was coined; however, Trashion usually refers to "making something from nothing" for aesthetic purposes, not for practical use.

In the 1990s, American artist Ann Wizer began using [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]] in her [[wearable art]].  Working in the Philippines, and titling her line the 'Virus Project,' Wizer created a set of costumes made entirely from post consumer plastic waste to celebrate [[Earth Day]]. The first plastic packaging tote bags were accessories to these costumes. There are now numerous small scale [[poverty reduction|poverty intervention]] projects throughout Southeast Asia in the process of creating similar trashion accessories and other fashion and homeware items. This includes the XSProject, a charity founded by Wizer and based in [[Jakarta]].

The Trashion movement took off in New York City in late 2004, early 2005 through underground parties on the lower east side of Manhattan at a club called Plan B. Trashion was part of the fashion of Urban Gypsy Circus, which is an interactive art party thrown by multi-media artist Miz Metro. These parties exhibited art made out of recycled materials and included monthly "TRASHION FACEOFFS" where 2 designers would compete to be the "TRASHION QUEEN". This led to Matthew Namer &amp; Miz Metro curating the TRASHION Art show at Gallery 151 on exhibit during the summer of 2009 on the lower east side of Manhattan.

Trashion has become a very popular style of art. For example, in 2006, Julia Genatossio launched Monsoon Vermont, a trashion design house.  The company designs items such as umbrellas, shower curtains and backpacks which are made from Jakarta's scavenged trash. Unlike the XSProject, Monsoon Vermont is a for-profit venture.&lt;ref&gt;Regis, Necee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22429">The '''UN Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF)''' is an instrument designed to roll out the [[UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy]].&lt;ref name="unp"&gt;[https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/un-global-counter-terrorism-strategy un.org: "UN GLOBAL COUNTER-TERRORISM STRATEGY"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its formation in 2005, the task force has brought forth different initiatives that assist in the Counter Terrorism Strategy including the UN Counter Terrorism Handbook.  Its working groups have offered workshops and presented reports that are designed to assist important UN actors, member states and stakeholders in the fight against terrorism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalct.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/rosand_policybrief_091.pdf|title=The UN’s Role in Implementing its Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Before the CTITF was formed, the Security Council of the UN legally binded all member states through resolutions relating to the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/215035/pdf|title=The United Nations, Counter Terrorism, and Human Rights: Institutional Adaptation and Embedded Ideas|last=Foot|first=Rosemary|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolutions included;

The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267]], adopted in October 1999 requires the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan to stop providing refuge to terrorist organizations and demand that they cooperate in bringing terrorists to justice.  This resolution also imposes aviation actions and financial sanctions on the Taliban.  It also established the Security Council Committee.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sanctionsandsecurity.nd.edu/assets/110258/action_agenda_un_counterterrorism.pdf|title=An Action Agenda for Enhancing the United Nations Program on Counter-Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373]], adopted in September 2001 under Chapter VII of the [[United Nations Charter]].  The aims of this resolution is to hinder terrorist actions.  This resolution calls on states to adjust national laws to better combat terrorism and focuses on regulating immigration laws to contain the spread of terrorism.  It also place legal obligations on member states requiring them to freeze any financial assets of terrorist and supporters, deny travel means or safe havens for terrorists, and prevent their weapon supply and recruitment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These resolutions began the formation of branches in the United Nations to combat terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=qBQ0jcXc2vcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=United+Nations+Counter+Terrorism+Implementation+Task+Force&amp;ots=3yj8CGAven&amp;sig=s2SJ3u__4vnA8LMF31fypu3hVUk#v=onepage&amp;q=United%20Nations%20Counter%20Terrorism%20Implementation%20Task%20Force&amp;f=false|title=Uniting Against Terror: Cooperative Nonmilitary Responses to the Global Terrorist Threat|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Secretary- General [[Kofi Annan]] created the United Nations Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force.  It was later endorsed by the General Assembly in 2006 through the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, to ensure that all terrorism units in the UN work together to increase the efficiency and range.

== Makeup ==
The Secretary General appoints a senior United Nations official to act as the chair of the task force.  The task force is divided into approximately 38 member entities including the [[World Bank]], the Youth Envoy and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opcw.org/special-sections/ctitf-report/about-the-united-nations-counter-terrorism-implementation-task-force/|title=About the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Interpol|INTERPOL]].  The CTITF is divided into 4 subgroups; the [[United Nations Security Council]], the [[United Nations Secretariat|Secretariat]], the Agencies Programmes Funds and Observers. The goal of the CTITF is to maximize each of the entity‘s comparative advantage by delivering as one to help Member States implement the four pillars of the Global Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/working-groups|title=Working Groups of the UN|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pillars of the CTITF ==
The intent of Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force is to help states in the UN enforce the 4 building blocks that make up Global Strategy.  The four Pillars are;
* Pillar 1- Methods of being aware of the circumstances that encourage possibilities of terrorism.
* Pillar 2- Methods preventing and combating terrorism.
* Pillar 3- Methods that allow states to be better equipped to fight terrorism and how the United Nations can help.
* Pillar 4- Methods that enforce the rule of law as the foundation of fighting terrorism and ensuring all have human rights.
The Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force is responsible for ensuring all needs of member states in the United Nations are met and policies are supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/about-task-force|title=Coordination and coherence of the counter-terrorism efforts of the United Nations|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status of Working Groups ==
The status of working groups has implemented a project on harmonized border management, compiling all recent international conventions, and best practices in an applicable, user-friendly format to help interested states build the institutional and procedural mechanisms for an effective border management system A working arrangement on harmonized border management has been completed by the working group. This idea will continue to be maximized through ongoing consultations with member states and international organizations.

== Entities ==
Entities of the United Nations Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force involve;

'''Mobility and processing of people'''

Because the processes that allow travel and economic and cultural exchanges is exploited by terrorists, measures that are put in place to prevent terrorism have become explicitly linked to the management and regulation of movement across borders. These measures include implementing passenger integrated border-management systems, issuing secure travel documents, promoting exchange of information among stakeholders, training, and capacity-building.  Improving in areas like this can help heighten security and immigration systems while also allowing the cross-border movement of people. Some of these measures are technologically complex, but more basic systems can be achieved in traditional areas of migration- management with a view to enhancing overall capacity&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Movement and processing of goods'''

Global trade, as well as the international supply chain are vulnerable to manipulation by terrorists. In order to minimize this vulnerability, a range of measures should be taken, including ensuring receipt of advance electronic cargo information about inbound, outbound and transit shipments; employing a consistent risk-management approach to address threats to cargo security; using non-intrusive detection equipment; promoting cooperation among customs administrations (e.g. by performing outbound inspection of high-risk containers and cargo); and establishing partnerships with the private sector for the implementation of secure practices at every stage of the supply chain, through Authorized Economic Operator (AEO). The implementation of these and other measures is key in order to maximize security in international trade and facilitate the movement of goods across borders programmes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Maritime security'''

Over 90 per cent of the total goods traded internationally is transported from source to destination along the world’s main global sea-trading routes he security of the maritime domain is therefore classified as a major problem of global importance. The aims of maritime security are to detect and deter security threats; to take preventive measures against security incidents affecting ships or port facilities; and to safeguard passengers, crews, ships and their cargoes, port facilities and the people who work and live in port areas, while still allowing for the safe and efficient movement of maritime trade.   Effective implementation of the relevant legislative and practical security measures is necessary in order to prevent unlawful acts against the passengers and crew of ships engaged in international voyages and against the port facilities that serve them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Early warning and alert systems'''

Border security is a dynamic and constantly changing process because the illegal cross-border movement of people affects not only the security, but also economic and social welfare of states. Comprehensive early-warning and alert systems are therefore key components of effective border management systems. They strengthen the collective capacity of states to detect, and combat terrorism, by facilitating inter-agency cooperation and the timely sharing and exchange of pertinent, reliable information, allow the enabling important decisions to be taken in a reasonable manner&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many international organizations with a border-control mandate and utilize early- warning and alert systems. Those tools include the [[World Customs Organization|WCO]] CEN and RILO networks; IMOSOLAS, LRIT and AIS; the Consolidated Lists of the Security Council “sanctions” committees, and the “I-24/7” secure global communications system, SLTD database and Notices regime of the International Criminal Police Organization ([[Interpol|INTERPOL]])&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Working Groups ==
The United Nations Secretariat, agencies, funds and programmes, and affiliated organizations contribute to the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy both through their individual mandates and through their membership in the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/working-groups|title=Working Groups of the UN's Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated Assistance for Countering Terrorism is an important working group in the Task force.  The working group consists of representatives from different UN entities involved in putting the counter terrorism strategy in action for countries who wish to receive help from the UN.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2014, the inter-agency [[working group]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the CTITF were reformed in 2014 to help improve efficiency and effectiveness of the entities' in achieving results.

Some of the working groups currently in place include;

'''Border Management and Law Enforcement relating to Counter-Terrorism'''

This working group strives to allow guidance to Member States on implementation of legal, institutional and practical counter-terrorism-related border control measures required. It focuses on the following areas: terrorist mobility; integrity and security of travel documents; illicit movement of cash and bearer negotiable instruments; movement and processing of goods; illicit movement of small arms, light weapons, ammunition, explosives and weapons of mass destruction; aviation and maritime security; early-warning and alert systems. This Working Group was established to help Member States strengthen their border-management and border-control systems as set out in Pillar II, in paragraphs 4,5, 7, 8, 13 to 16 and Pillar III, in paragraphs 2, 4 and 11 to 13 of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/border-management-and-law-enforcement-relating-counter-terrorism|title=Border Management and Law Enforcement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Countering the Financing of Terrorism'''

This working group incorporates various international organizations and other united nations entities to reverse the funding of various forms of terrorism.  This working group ensures the standard to countering the finance of terrorism is met according to the International Convention  for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the Financial Action Task Force.  The actions of the working group includes coordinating with different entities on the subject of repression of terrorism finances.  From February 2007 to December 2008, multiple meetings took place with banks, financial intelligence, law enforcement, criminal justice experts, national security intelligence etc. to establish how to efficiently fight the financing of terrorism.

The conclusions from these meeting as to how to suppress terrorism financially include; the criminalization of terrorist financing, the enhancement of domestic and international cooperation, value transfer systems, non-profit organizations, and the freezing of assets.  Based on the conclusions, the International Monetary Fund was able to prepare an action plan with motions for the employment of the above conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/countering-financing-terrorism|title=Countering the finance of Global Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTF)'''

This working group was formed on September 24, 2014 when Resolution 2178 was formed to monitor and control terrorism threats and foreign terrorist fighters.  The definition of Foreign terrorist fighters is people who travel to a state outside of their own to involve themselves in terrorist activities (ie. planning, preparing, perpetration terrorist acts, receiving or providing terrorism training etc.)  The Security Council has stated that terrorist groups such as the Islamic state, Al-Qaida etc. have attracted over 30,000 foreign terrorist fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sc/ctc/focus-areas/foreign-terrorist-fighters/|title=Foreign Terrorist Fighters|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National and Regional Counter-Terrorism Strategies'''

On June 29, 2012, the national and regional efforts to combat terrorism was expanded due to the encouragement from the General Assembly.  This working group is used to assist in unrolling national counterterrorism strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/national-and-regional-counter-terrorism-strategies|title=National and Regional Counterterrorism Strategies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preventing and Responding to WMD Terrorist Attacks'''

This working group is used to monitor the success of the UN strategies in response to terrorist attacks (nuclear, chemical, biological, radiological or any other type of weapons used). The group has formed a communal exchange of information among other UN entities and working groups such as knowledge on existing activities and emergency plans in response to WMD attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/preventing-and-responding-wmd-terrorist-attacks|title=Preventing and Responding to Terrorist Attacks|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preventing Violent Extremism and Conditions Conducive to the Spread of Terrorism'''

Since February 2015, this working group has aided in the Secretary General’s efforts to prevent violent extremism.  The working group gave input on the effects of extremism and the causes of it.  They also provided advice on how to assist member states in preventing violent extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/preventing-violent-extremism|title=Preventing Violent Extremism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Promoting and Protecting Human Rights and the Rule of Law While Countering Terrorism'''

This working group was formed by member states to assure human rights are protected and the rule of law is obeyed.  Pillar IV of the  CTITF plays a large role in the implementation.  The goal of this group is to gather information exchange on human rights and the rule of law capacity building surrounding the concept of counter terrorism.  This working group has now set in place a support and assistance function available to member states to ensure human rights and the rule of law is well established.  In April 2013, a global project was launched by this working group called Capacity Building and Training of Law Enforcement Officials on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and the Prevention of Terrorism.  The goal of this project is to properly train law enforcement officials in charge of counter terrorism on human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-and-rule-law-while-countering-terrorism|title=Promoting and Protecting Human Rights and the Rule of Law While Countering Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Protection of Critical Infrastructure Including Internet, Vulnerable Targets and Tourism Security'''

This working group’s role is to uphold confidentiality, respecting human rights under international law.  Their goals are to control efforts, both regionally and internationally to counter terrorism in its various forms on the internet as well as improve security of vulnerable targets such as infrastructure and public places.  The objectives are to;
* establish ways to expedite the development and sharing of the most efficient methods on the protection of vulnerable sites, public spaces or critical infrastructure that are important to the state or internationally.
* fortify the competence of public and private sectors and to augment the development of public and private partnerships on protection of critical infrastructure, including Internet, cyber and tourism security, to prevent and react in an efficient manner to possible risks and threats to related facilities.  This includes promoting awareness and comprehension of the balance required between economic and security issues.
* improve responsiveness and flexibility by having methods in place of planning, prevention, crisis management and recovery
* promote the exchange of information.
* support states in the implementation of the provisions of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy that are relevant to the working group’s focus areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/protection-critical-infrastructure-including-vulnerable-targets-internet-and-tourism-security|title=Protection of Critical Infrastructure including Vulnerable Targets, Internet and Tourism Security|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Supporting and Highlighting Victims of Terrorism'''

The role of this working group is to provide support and aids to victims of terrorism.  They promote the rights of the victims through media platforms, workshops etc.  The mandate of this working group is stated within Pillar I and Pillar IV stating the strategy seeks to “promote international solidarity in support of victims”, stress “the need to promote and protect the rights of victims of terrorism and their families and facilitate the normalization of their lives” and sees the “dehumanization of victims of terrorism” as a major concern that leads to the spread of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/supporting-and-highlighting-victims-terrorism|title=Supporting and Highlighting Victims of Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal and Criminal Justice Responses to Terrorism'''

The three roles of this working group are;  to help coordination in the UN regarding activities of various entities in the UN that are involved in supporting legal and criminal justice in response to terrorism, developing an approach for the UN in dealing with legal and criminal justice matters with regards to terrorism and to give advice and legal assistance to member states with involving legal and criminal justice regarding terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/legal-and-criminal-justice-responses-terrorism|title=Legal and Criminal Justice Responses to Terrorism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender Sensitive Approach to Preventing and Countering Terrorism'''

This working group was created because of the fact that women began playing a more important role in the fight against terrorism as they are influential in regards to families, communities and governments.  This working group is still in formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sc/ctc/focus-areas/womens-role/|title=Role of women in countering terrorism and violent extremism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''uncertain plural''' occurs when a writer does not know in advance whether a word should be written in the [[Grammatical number|singular]] or [[plural]].  For [[English language|English]] nouns, this may be demonstrated by enclosing the trailing ''s'' in parentheses, such as "book(s)".

In the case of articles, "they" or "their" may be used to include a single individual, when uncertain.

The '''War on Terror''', also known as the '''Global War on Terrorism''', is an international military campaign that was launched by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] after the [[September 11 attacks]] against the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Schmitt/slogan"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/politics/26strategy.html?_r=0|title=U.S. Officials Retool Slogan for Terror War|first=|newspaper= New York Times|date=26 July 2005|author=Eric Schmitt|author2=Thom Shanker}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The naming of the campaign uses a [[War as metaphor|metaphor of war]] to refer to a variety of actions that do not constitute a specific war as traditionally defined. U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] first used the [[Slogans and terms derived from the September 11 attacks|term]] "''war on terrorism"'' on 16 September 2001,&lt;ref name="evilwar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="evilwar2" /&gt; and then "''war on terror''" a few days later in a formal speech to Congress.&lt;ref name="whitehousejoint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnntranscript" /&gt;  In the latter speech, George Bush stated, "Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them."&lt;ref name="cnntranscript" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/bushaddress_092001.html|title=washingtonpost.com|website=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was originally used with a particular focus on countries associated with [[al-Qaeda]].  The term was immediately criticised by such people as [[Richard B. Myers]], chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and more nuanced ones subsequently came to be used by the [[Presidency of George W.

U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] announced on 23 May 2013 that the Global War on Terror is over, saying the military and intelligence agencies will not wage war against a tactic but will instead focus on a specific group of networks determined to destroy the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/05/23/obama-global-war-on-terror-is-over|title=Obama: 'Global War on Terror' Is Over|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December 2014, the Obama administration announced the end of the combat role of the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-war-idUSKBN0K60FB20141228|title=U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan ends combat role; thousands of…|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the unexpected rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] terror group led to a new operation against terror in the Middle East and South Asia, [[Operation Inherent Resolve]].

[[Criticism of the War on Terror]] focused on morality, efficiency, economics; some, including later president [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/aug/06/white-house-war-terrorism-over/ White House: ‘War on terrorism’ is over] August 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="declover" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whitehdefuniv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="terrorover" /&gt; objected to the phrase itself as a [[misnomer]]. The notion of a "war" against "terrorism" has proven contentious, with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives,&lt;ref name="Monbiot2003" /&gt; reduce [[civil liberties]],&lt;ref name="Wired-FBI" /&gt; and infringe upon human rights. Critics also assert that the term "war" is not appropriate in this context (much like the term "[[War on Drugs]]") since there is no identifiable enemy and it is unlikely that international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.&lt;ref name="Richissin" /&gt;

=={{anchor|Terminology}}Etymology==

[[File:OCO GWOT.jpg|thumb|Letter from Barack Obama indicating appropriation of Congressional funds for "Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism"]]

The phrase "War on Terror" has been used to specifically refer to the ongoing military campaign led by the U.S., U.K. and their allies against organizations and regimes identified by them as terrorist, and usually excludes other independent [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist operations and campaigns]] such as those by Russia and India. The conflict has also been referred to by names other than the War on Terror. It has also been known as:

===History of use of the phrase and its rejection by the U.S. government===
{{update|section|date=April 2018}}
In 1984, the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], which had significantly expanded the CIA-run [[Operation Cyclone|program of funding]] the [[Mujahideen|Jihadi militants in Afghanistan]], employed the term "war against terrorism" to pass legislation aimed at countering terrorist groups in the wake of the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] that killed 241 U.S. and 58 French [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silver |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1973131,00.html |title=How America Became a Surveillance State |work=Time Magazine |date=18 March 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Vice President]] [[Mike Pence]] called the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing "the opening salvo in a war that we have waged ever since—the global war on terror,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/trump-administration-says-war-terror-began-911-hezbollah-attack-us-troops-691653|title=Mike Pence says Hezbollah started the war on terror with a 1983 attack in Beirut|date=24 October 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the U.S. at war with terrorism may have begun on 11 September 2001 when [[Tom Brokaw]], having just witnessed the collapse of one of the towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], declared "Terrorists have declared war on [America]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.nbclearn.com/portal/site/k-12/flatview?cuecard=1419 |title=Breaking News on September 11th |author=[[Matt Lauer]] |author2=[[Katie Couric]] |author3=Tom Brokaw |date=11 September 2001 |website=NBC Learn K-12 |publisher=NBCUniversal Media |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 2001, at [[Camp David]], U.S. president George W. Bush used the phrase ''war on terrorism'' in an ostensibly unscripted comment when answering a journalist′s question about the impact of enhanced law enforcement authority given to the [[Mass surveillance in the United States|U.S. surveillance]] agencies on Americans′ civil liberties: "This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil.

In April 2007, the British government announced publicly that it was abandoning the use of the phrase "War on Terror" as they found it to be less than helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Reynolds|first=Paul |date=17 April 2007 |title=Declining use of 'war on terror' |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6562709.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was explained more recently by Lady [[Eliza Manningham-Buller]]. In her 2011 [[Reith lecture]], the former head of [[MI5]] said that the 9/11 attacks were "a crime, not an act of war. So I never felt it helpful to refer to a war on terror."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Norton-Taylor |first=Richard |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2 September 2011 |title=MI5 former chief decries 'war on terror' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/02/mi5-war-on-terror-criticism |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. president [[Barack Obama]] rarely used the term, but in his inaugural address on 20 January 2009, he stated: "Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Inauguration/story?id=6689022&amp;page=1 |title=FULL TRANSCRIPT: President Barack Obama's Inaugural Address|publisher=ABC News |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009 the Defense Department officially changed the name of operations from "Global War on Terror" to "Overseas Contingency Operation" (OCO).&lt;ref name="oco-wapost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/24/AR2009032402818.html|title='Global War On Terror' Is Given New Name|author1=Scott Wilson |author2=Al Kamen |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=The Washington Post|date= 25 March 2009 |page= A04|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] requested that [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] staff members avoid the use of the term and instead to use "Overseas Contingency Operation".&lt;ref name="oco-wapost"/&gt; Basic objectives of the Bush administration "war on terror", such as targeting al Qaeda and building international counterterrorism alliances, remain in place.&lt;ref&gt;Jai Singh and Ajay Singh, "[http://smallwarsjournal.com/printpdf/13142 The War on Terror – Over] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120045914/http://smallwarsjournal.com/printpdf/13142 |date=20 January 2013 }}?", ''Small Wars Journal'', 28 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Kravets, "[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/09/bush-obama-war-on-terror/ Former CIA Chief: Obama's War on Terror Same as Bush's, But With More Killing]", ''Wired'', 10 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, the Obama administration published a report outlining its [[National Security Strategy (United States)|National Security Strategy]].  The document dropped the Bush-era phrase "global war on terror" and reference to "Islamic extremism," and stated, "This is not a global war against a tactic  —  terrorism, or a religion  —  Islam.

In May 2013, two years after the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|assassination]] of [[Osama bin Laden]], Barack Obama delivered a speech that employed the term ''global war on terror'' put in quotation marks (as officially transcribed by the White House): ″Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists. &lt; ... &gt; But we have to recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. &lt; ... &gt; From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation  —  and world  —  that we leave to our children.  So America is at a crossroads.  We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us.  We have to be mindful of James Madison's warning that "No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare."  &lt; ... &gt; In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country's security. &lt; ... &gt;  Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless "global war on terror," but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America.  In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.″ Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasise the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Congress had authorised]] the use of force, he went on to say, ″Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces.  We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first.  So this is a just war  —  a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense.″&lt;ref name=whitehdefuniv&gt;[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/remarks-president-national-defense-university Remarks by the President at the National Defense University] The White House, 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=terrorover&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama: 'Global War on Terror' Is Over |author=Paul D.

===The rhetorical war on terror===

Because the actions involved in the "war on terrorism" are diffuse, and the criteria for inclusion are unclear, political theorist Richard Jackson has argued that "the 'war on terrorism,' therefore, is simultaneously a set of actual practices—wars, covert operations, agencies, and institutions—and an accompanying series of assumptions, beliefs, justifications, and narratives—it is an entire language or discourse."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson cites among many examples a statement by [[John Ashcroft]] that "the attacks of September 11 drew a bright line of demarcation between the civil and the savage".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Administration officials also described "terrorists" as hateful, treacherous, barbarous, mad, twisted, perverted, without faith, [[Parasitism|parasitical]], inhuman, and, most commonly, evil.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), pp. 62–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Americans, in contrast, were described as brave, loving, generous, strong, resourceful, heroic, and respectful of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''Writing the War on Terrorism'' (2005), pp. 77–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the term and the policies it denotes have been a source of ongoing controversy, as critics argue it has been used to justify unilateral [[preventive war]], human rights abuses and other violations of international law.&lt;ref&gt;Borhan Uddin Khan and Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman, "Combating Terrorism under Human Rights and Humanitarian Law Regime", ''Mediterranean Journal of Human Rights," Vol. 12 (Double Issue), 2008, pp.379–397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==

===Precursor to the September 11 attacks===
{{See also|Islamic terrorism|List of Islamist terrorist attacks}}

The origins of al-Qaeda can be traced back to the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] (December 1979 – February 1989). The United States, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, [[Pakistan]], and the People's Republic of China supported the [[Islamism|Islamist]] Afghan [[mujahadeen]] [[guerilla warfare|guerillas]] against the military forces of the Soviet Union and the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].

On 20 September 2001, in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], George W. Bush delivered an ultimatum to the Taliban government of Afghanistan, the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]], to turn over Osama bin Laden and [[al-Qaeda]] leaders operating in the country or face attack.&lt;ref name="cnntranscript" /&gt; The Taliban demanded evidence of bin Laden's link to the 11 September attacks and, if such evidence warranted a trial, they offered to handle such a trial in an Islamic Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban rejects president Bush's demands |publisher=PBS |date=21 September 2001 |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/september01/taliban_9-21.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601224636/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/september01/taliban_9-21.html |archivedate=1 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. refused to provide any evidence.

Subsequently, in October 2001, U.S. forces (with UK and coalition allies) invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban regime. On 7 October 2001, the official invasion began with British and U.S. forces conducting [[airstrike]] campaigns over enemy targets. Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan, [[Fall of Kabul|fell by mid-November]]. The remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants fell back to the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, mainly Tora Bora. In December, Coalition forces (the U.S. and its allies) [[Battle of Tora Bora|fought within that region]]. It is believed that Osama bin Laden escaped into Pakistan during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/world/asia/29torabora.html?_r=1 |title=Senate Report Explores 2001 Escape by bin Laden From Afghan Mountains |work=The New York Times |date=28 November 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Scott |last=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/29/osama-bin-laden-senate-report |title=Rumsfeld let Bin Laden escape in 2001, says Senate report |date=29 November 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Ed |last=Pilkington |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2002, the U.S. and other [[NATO]] and non-NATO forces launched [[Operation Anaconda]] with the goal of destroying any remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the [[Shah-i-Kot Valley]] and [[Arma Mountains]] of Afghanistan. The Taliban suffered heavy casualties and evacuated the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/c-asia/DC12Ag01.html |work=[[Asia Times Online]] |date=12 March 2002 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Syed Saleem |last=Shahzad |title=Taliban find unlikely allies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

December 2001 saw the creation of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to assist the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] and the first post-Taliban elected government. With a renewed Taliban insurgency, it was announced in 2006 that ISAF would replace the U.S. troops in the province as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

The British [[16th Air Assault Brigade]] (later reinforced by [[Royal Marines]]) formed the core of the force in southern Afghanistan, along with troops and helicopters from Australia, Canada and the Netherlands. The initial force consisted of roughly 3,300 British, 2,000 Canadian, 1,400 from the Netherlands and 240 from Australia, along with special forces from Denmark and [[Estonia]] and small contingents from other nations. The monthly supply of cargo containers through Pakistani route to ISAF in Afghanistan is over 4,000 costing around {{nowrap|12 billion}} in Pakistani Rupees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2011/01/29/war-on-terror-cost-of-us-taxpayers-patience/#.TtjwPLLNllk |title=Afghan war cost rise tests US taxpayers' patience |publisher=Thenewstribe.com |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK troops take over Afghan duties|date=1 June 2006|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4961368.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada set for longer Afghan stay |date=16 June 2006 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4984880.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia outlines Afghan force|date=8 May 2006|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4983540.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Dutch troops for Afghanistan |date=3 February 2006 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iraq]] had been listed as a [[State sponsor of terrorism]] by the U.S. since 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq accuses U.S., Turkey of 'illegally' meeting with Kurds |publisher=CNN |date=9 March 2000 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/03/09/un.iraq/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516120925/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/03/09/un.iraq/index.html |archivedate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Saddam Hussein]] [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded Kuwait]]. Iraq had also been on the list from 1979 to 1982; it was removed so that the U.S. could provide material support to Iraq in its [[Iran–Iraq War|war with Iran]]. Hussein's regime had proven to be a problem for the UN and Iraq's neighbors due to its use of [[chemical weapons]] against [[Iranian people|Iranians]] and [[Kurds]] in the 1980s.

===Iraqi no-fly zones===

Following the ceasefire agreement that suspended hostilities (but not officially ended) in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the United States and its allies instituted and began patrolling [[Iraqi no-fly zones]], to protect Iraq's [[Kurds|Kurdish]] and [[Shi'a]] [[Arab]] population—both of which suffered attacks from the Hussein regime before and after the Gulf War—in Iraq's northern and southern regions, respectively. U.S. forces continued in combat zone deployments through November 1995 and launched [[Operation Desert Fox]] against Iraq in 1998 after it failed to meet U.S. demands for "unconditional cooperation" in weapons inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton: Iraq has abused its final chance |publisher=CNN |date=16 December 1998 |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/16/clinton/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of Operation Desert Fox, during December 1998, Iraq announced that it would no longer respect the no-fly zones and resumed its attempts to shoot down U.S. aircraft.

===Operation Iraqi Freedom===
{{Main|Iraq War}}

The Iraq War began in March 2003 with an air campaign, which was immediately followed by a [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S.-led ground invasion]]. The Bush administration stated the invasion was the "serious consequences" spoken of in the UNSC Resolution 1441, partially by [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction]]. The Bush administration also [[Iraq War and U.S. Global War on Terror|stated the Iraq war]] was part of the War on Terror; something later [[Criticism of the War on Terror|questioned or contested]].

The first ground attack came at the [[Battle of Umm Qasr]] on 21 March 2003 when a combined force of British, American and Polish forces seized control of the port city of [[Umm Qasr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Parker |first=Nick |last2=McCarthy |first2=Rory |date=23 March 2003 |title=Fierce battle around port |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/24/iraq.rorymccarthy |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=17 March 2015}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|author=Mike Ryan|title=Baghdad or Bust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AhjOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136|date=4 December 2003|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-84415-020-5|pages=136–137}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|author=Leigh Neville|title=Special Operations Forces in Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cqi3yVGkDZ8C&amp;pg=PA10|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84908-826-8|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|Baghdad, Iraq's capital city, fell]] to American troops in April 2003 and Saddam Hussein's government quickly dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Beth Norton|author2=Carol Sheriff|author3=David M.

The rebellion, which included [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq|al-Qaeda-affiliated groups]], led to far more coalition casualties [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|than the invasion]]. Other elements of the insurgency were led by fugitive members of President Hussein's [[Ba'ath]] regime, which included Iraqi nationalists and [[pan-Arabist]]s.

[[Execution of Saddam Hussein|He was executed]] in 2006.

In 2004, the insurgent forces grew stronger. The U.S. conducted attacks on insurgent strongholds in cities like [[Battle of Najaf (2004)|Najaf]] and [[Second Battle of Fallujah|Fallujah]].

In January 2007, President Bush presented a new strategy for Operation Iraqi Freedom based upon [[counter-insurgency]] theories and tactics developed by General [[David Petraeus]]. The [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]] was part of this "new way forward" and, along with U.S. backing of [[Sunni]] groups it had previously sought to defeat, has been credited with a widely recognized dramatic decrease in violence by up to 80%.

In a major split in the ranks of Al Qaeda's organization, the Iraqi franchise, known as [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]] covertly invaded Syria and the Levant and began participating in the ongoing Syrian Civil War, gaining enough support and strength to re-invade Iraq's western provinces under the name of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS/ISIL), taking over much of the country in a [[blitzkrieg]]-like action and combining the [[Iraqi insurgency (2011–14)|Iraq insurgency]] and [[Syrian Civil War]] into a single conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/ctc-perspectives-al-baghdadis-blitzkrieg-isils-psychological-warfare-and-what-it-means-for-syria-and-iraq |title=CTC Perspectives: Al-Baghdadi's Blitzkrieg, ISIL's Psychological Warfare, and What it Means for Syria and Iraq |last1=Price |first1=Bryan |last2=Milton |first2=Dan |last3=al-'Ubaydi |first3=Muhammad |date=12 June 2014 |website=Combating Terrorism Center |publisher=United States Military Academy |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their extreme brutality and a complete change in their overall ideology, Al Qaeda's core organization in Central Asia eventually denounced ISIS and directed their affiliates to cut off all ties with this organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Calamur |first=Krishnadev |date=13 June 2014 |title=ISIS: An Islamist Group Too Extreme Even For Al-Qaida |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/06/13/321665375/isis-an-islamist-group-too-extreme-even-for-al-qaida |newspaper=National Public Radio |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many analysts{{who|date=September 2014}} believe that because of this schism, Al Qaeda and ISIL are now in a competition to retain the title of the world's most powerful terrorist organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-war-between-isis-and-al-qaeda-for-supremacy-of-the-global-jihadist|title=The War between ISIS and al-Qaeda for Supremacy of the Global Jihadist Movement – The Washington Institute for Near East Policy|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, former President of Pakistan [[Pervez Musharraf]] sided with the U.S. against the Taliban government in Afghanistan after an ultimatum by then U.S. President George W. Bush. Musharraf agreed to give the U.S. the use of three airbases for Operation Enduring Freedom. [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] and other U.S. administration officials met with Musharraf. On 19 September 2001, Musharraf addressed the people of Pakistan and stated that, while he opposed military tactics against the Taliban, Pakistan risked being endangered by an alliance of India and the U.S. if it did not cooperate. In 2006, Musharraf testified that this stance was pressured by threats from the U.S., and revealed in his memoirs that he had "war-gamed" the United States as an adversary and decided that it would end in a loss for Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-09-25-pakistan-memoir_x.htm|title= Musharraf's book says Pakistan faced U.S. 'onslaught' if it didn't back terror war|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014|work=USA Today|date=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2002, Musharraf gave a speech against Islamic extremism. He unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism and pledged to combat Islamic extremism and lawlessness within Pakistan itself. He stated that his government was committed to rooting out extremism and made it clear that the banned militant organizations would not be allowed to resurface under any new name. He said, "the recent decision to ban extremist groups promoting militancy was taken in the national interest after thorough consultations. It was not taken under any foreign influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dawn.com/dawnftp/72.249.57.55/dawnftp/fixed/arch/arch_2003.html |title=Musharraf vows to root out extremism: Banned outfits won't be allowed to resurface |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=5 December 2003 |first=Rafaqat |last=Ali |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317081424/http://archives.dawn.com/dawnftp/72.249.57.55/dawnftp/fixed/arch/arch_2003.html |archivedate=17 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Musharraf-led government took a firm stand against the jihadi organizations and groups promoting extremism, and arrested [[Maulana Masood Azhar]], head of the [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]], and [[Hafiz Muhammad Saeed]], chief of the [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]], and took dozens of activists into custody. An official ban was imposed on the groups on 12 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/DH20Df07.html |title=Musharraf braced for jihadi backlash |publisher=Atimes.com |date=20 August 2002 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] born [[Abu Zubaydah|Zayn al-Abidn Muhammed Hasayn Abu Zubaydah]] was arrested by Pakistani officials during a series of joint U.S.-Pakistan raids.

In 2004, the [[Pakistan Army]] launched a campaign in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] of Pakistan's [[Waziristan]] region, sending in 80,000 troops. The goal of the conflict was to remove the al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the area.

After the fall of the Taliban regime, many members of the Taliban resistance fled to the Northern border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan where the Pakistani army had previously little control. With the logistics and air support of the United States, the Pakistani Army captured or killed numerous al-Qaeda operatives such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, wanted for his involvement in the USS ''Cole'' bombing, the [[Bojinka plot]], and the killing of ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter [[Daniel Pearl]].

The United States has carried out a campaign of [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|Drone attacks]] on targets all over the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. However, the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Pakistani Taliban]] still operates there. To this day it is estimated that 15 U.S. soldiers were killed while fighting al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants in Pakistan since the War on Terror began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icasualties.org/oef/ |title=Operation Enduring Freedom &amp;#124; Afghanistan |publisher=iCasualties |date=28 May 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406083558/http://icasualties.org/oef/ |archivedate=6 April 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of drones by the Central Intelligence Agency in Pakistan to carry out operations associated with the Global War on Terror sparks debate over sovereignty and the laws of war. The U.S. Government uses the CIA rather than the [[U.S. Air Force]] for strikes in Pakistan to avoid breaching sovereignty through military invasion. The United States was criticized by{{according to whom|date=May 2015}} a report on drone warfare and [[Airspace|aerial sovereignty]] for abusing the term 'Global War on Terror' to carry out military operations through government agencies without formally declaring war.

In the three years before the attacks of 11 September, Pakistan received approximately {{nowrap|US$9 million}} in American military aid. In the three years after, the number increased to {{nowrap|US$4.2 billion}}, making it the country with the maximum funding post 9/11.

===Baluchistan===
An uprising in [[Baluchistan]] began after Pakistan invaded and occupied the territory in 1948. Various NGOs have reported human rights violations in committed by Pakistani armed forces. Approximately 18,000 Baluch residents are reportedly missing and about 2000 have been killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/01/balochistans-missing-persons/|title=Balochistan's Missing Persons|first=Kiran Nazish, The|last=Diplomat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Northern Mali conflict.svg|thumb]]

Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara (OEF-TS) is the name of the military operation conducted by the U.S. and partner nations in the Sahara/Sahel region of Africa, consisting of counter-terrorism efforts and policing of arms and drug trafficking across central Africa.

The [[Northern Mali conflict (2012–present)|conflict in northern Mali]] began in January 2012 with radical Islamists (affiliated to al-Qaeda) advancing into northern Mali. The Malian government had a hard time maintaining full control over their country. The fledgling government requested support from the international community on combating the Islamic militants. In January 2013, France intervened on behalf of the Malian government's request and deployed troops into the region. They launched [[Operation Serval]] on 11 January 2013, with the hopes of dislodging the al-Qaeda affiliated groups from northern Mali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mali conflict: militants killed as French air strikes pound rebel camps|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/13/mali-crisis-militants-killed-french-jets|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 January 2013|location=London|first=Nick|last=Hopkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension of Operation Enduring Freedom was titled OEF-HOA. Unlike other operations contained in Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF-HOA does not have a specific organization as a target. OEF-HOA instead focuses its efforts to disrupt and detect militant activities in the region and to work with willing governments to prevent the reemergence of militant cells and activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCE–HORN OF AFRICA |publisher=United States Africa Command |url=http://www.hoa.africom.mil/AboutCJTF-HOA.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426223216/http://www.hoa.africom.mil/AboutCJTF-HOA.asp |archivedate=26 April 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, the [[Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) was established in [[Djibouti]] at [[Camp Lemonnier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10504.pdf |title=DOD Needs to Determine the Future of Its Horn of Africa Task Force |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] |date = April 2010|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains approximately 2,000 personnel including U.S. military and special operations forces (SOF) and coalition force members, [[Combined Task Force 150]] (CTF-150).

Task Force 150 consists of ships from a shifting group of nations, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Pakistan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The primary goal of the coalition forces is to monitor, inspect, board and stop suspected shipments from entering the Horn of Africa region and affecting the United States' [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

Included in the operation is the training of selected armed forces units of the countries of Djibouti, [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]] in counter-terrorism and [[counter-insurgency]] tactics. Humanitarian efforts conducted by CJTF-HOA include rebuilding of schools and medical clinics and providing medical services to those countries whose forces are being trained.

The program expands as part of the [[Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative]] as CJTF personnel also assist in training the armed forces of [[Chad]], Niger, [[Mauritania]] and [[Mali]]. However, the War on Terror does not include Sudan, where over 400,000 have died in an ongoing civil war.

On 1 July 2006, a Web-posted message purportedly written by Osama bin Laden urged [[Somalis]] to build an [[Islamic state]] in the country and warned western governments that the al-Qaeda network would fight against them if they intervened there.&lt;ref name="BIN-LADEN-MESSAGE-IRAQ-SOMALIA"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-07-01-bin-laden-plans-message_x.htm |title=Bin Laden releases Web message on Iraq, Somalia |work=USA Today |date=1 July 2006 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somalia has been considered a "[[failed state]]" because its official central government was weak, dominated by warlords and unable to exert effective control over the country. Beginning in mid-2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), an Islamist faction campaigning on a restoration of "law and order" through [[Sharia]] law, had rapidly taken control of much of southern Somalia.

On 14 December 2006, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State [[Jendayi Frazer]] claimed al-Qaeda cell operatives were controlling the Islamic Courts Union, a claim denied by the ICU.&lt;ref name="US-SAYS-AL-QAEDA-BEHIND-SOMALI-ISLAMISTS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L14556061.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204082431/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L14556061.htm |archivedate=2008-02-04 |title=U.S. says al Qaeda behind Somali Islamists |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=4 February 2008 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 2006, the UN-backed [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) of Somalia had seen its power effectively limited to [[Baidoa]], while the Islamic Courts Union controlled the majority of southern Somalia, including the capital of [[Mogadishu]]. On 20 December 2006, the Islamic Courts Union launched an [[Battle of Baidoa|offensive]] on the government stronghold of Baidoa and saw early gains before Ethiopia intervened for the government.

By 26 December, the Islamic Courts Union retreated towards Mogadishu, before again retreating as TFG/Ethiopian troops neared, leaving them to take Mogadishu with [[Fall of Mogadishu|no resistance]]. The ICU then fled to [[Kismayo]], where they fought Ethiopian/TFG forces in the [[Battle of Jilib]].

The Prime Minister of Somalia claimed that three "terror suspects" from the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] are being sheltered in Kismayo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/13/usa.terrorism |work=The Guardian |location=London | title=Secret world of US jails | first=Jason | last=Burke | date=13 June 2004 | accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December 2006, al-Qaeda deputy leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] called upon Muslims worldwide to fight against Ethiopia and the TFG in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/cfr/world/slot2_20090227.html?_r=1|title= Backgrounder: Al-Shabaab |work=The New York Times|author=Stephanie Hanson|date=2 March 2009|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September 2009, [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Special Forces]] killed two men and wounded and captured two others near the Somali village of [[Baraawe raid|Baarawe]].

''NBC News'' reported that in mid-2014, [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya|ISIS had about 1,000 fighters in Libya]]. Taking advantage of a power vacuum in the center of the country, far from the major cities of Tripoli and Benghazi, ISIS expanded rapidly over the next 18 months. Local militants were joined by jihadists from the rest of North Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the Caucasus. The force absorbed or defeated other Islamist groups inside Libya and the central ISIS leadership in Raqqa, Syria, began urging foreign recruits to head for Libya instead of Syria. ISIS seized control of the coastal city of [[Sirte]] in early 2015 and then began to expand to the east and south. By the beginning of 2016, it had effective control of 120 to 150 miles of coastline and portions of the interior and had reached Eastern Libya's major population center, [[Benghazi]]. In spring 2016, [[United States Africa Command|AFRICOM]] estimated that ISIS had about 5,000 fighters in its stronghold of Sirte.&lt;ref name="Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/did-obama-defeat-isis-libya-n709001|title=Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya?|publisher=NBC news|date=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the indigenous rebel groups who had staked their claims to Libya and turned their weapons on ISIS — with the help of airstrikes by Western forces, including U.S. drones, the Libyan population resented the outsiders who wanted to establish a fundamentalist regime on their soil. Militias loyal to the new Libyan unity government, plus a separate and rival force loyal to a former officer in the Qaddafi regime, [[Battle of Sirte (2016)|launched an assault on ISIS outposts in Sirte]] and the surrounding areas that lasted for months. According to U.S. military estimates, ISIS ranks shrank to somewhere between a few hundred and 2,000 fighters. In August 2016, the [[Military intervention against ISIL#Intervention in Libya|U.S. military began airstrikes]] that, along with continued pressure on the ground from the Libyan militias, pushed the remaining ISIS fighters back into Sirte, In all, U.S. drones and planes hit ISIS nearly 590 times, the Libyan militias reclaimed the city in mid-December.&lt;ref name="Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya"/&gt; On January 18, 2017, ''ABC News'' reported that two USAF [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 bombers]] struck two ISIS camps {{convert|28|mi}} south of Sirte, the airstrikes targeted between 80 and 100 ISIS fighters in multiple camps, an unmanned aircraft also participated in the airstrikes. ''NBC News'' reported that as many as 90 ISIS fighters were killed in the strike, a U.S. defense official said that "This was the largest remaining ISIS presence in Libya," and that "They have been largely marginalized, but I am hesitant to say they have been eliminated in Libya."&lt;ref name="Did Obama Defeat ISIS in Libya"/&gt;

==International military support==
{{Main|Participants in Operation Enduring Freedom|Multi-National Force – Iraq}}
{{See also|Coalition combat operations in Afghanistan in 2008|Afghan War order of battle 2012}}

[[File:BritishPatrolHelmand01.jpg|thumb|The United Kingdom is the second largest contributor of troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]]]

The invasion of Afghanistan is seen to have been the first action of this war, and initially involved forces from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Afghan [[Northern Alliance]]. Since the initial invasion period, these forces were augmented by troops and aircraft from Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand and Norway amongst others. In 2006, there were about 33,000 troops in Afghanistan.

On 12 September 2001, less than 24 hours after the 11 September attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., NATO invoked Article 5 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] and declared the attacks to be an attack against all 19 NATO member countries. Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] also stated that Australia would invoke the [[ANZUS]] Treaty along similar lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 September 2001 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2001/s367069.htm |title=PM speaks on Ansett collapse, Anzus treaty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following months, NATO took a broad range of measures to respond to the threat of terrorism. On 22 November 2002, the member states of the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC) decided on a Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism, which explicitly states, "[The] EAPC States are committed to the protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights, as well as the rule of law, in combating terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism |url=http://pfpdev.ethz.ch/SCORMcontent/72234/scos/93/documents/0.pdf |date=22 November 2002 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |publisher=[[NATO]]}}{{Dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NATO started naval operations in the Mediterranean Sea designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction as well as to enhance the security of shipping in general called Operation Active Endeavour.

Support for the U.S. cooled when America made clear its determination to invade Iraq in late 2002. Even so, many of the "coalition of the willing" countries that unconditionally supported the U.S.-led military action have sent troops to Afghanistan, particular neighboring Pakistan, which has disowned its earlier support for the Taliban and contributed tens of thousands of soldiers to the conflict. Pakistan was also engaged in the [[War in North-West Pakistan]] (Waziristan War). Supported by U.S. intelligence, Pakistan was attempting to remove the Taliban insurgency and al-Qaeda element from the northern tribal areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New frontline in the war on terror.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrorist attacks and failed plots since 9/11==

===Al-Qaeda===
{{Main|al-Qaeda}}

Since 9/11, Al-Qaeda and other affiliated radical Islamist groups have executed attacks in several parts of the world where conflicts are not taking place. Whereas countries like Pakistan have suffered hundreds of attacks killing tens of thousands and displacing much more.
* The [[2002 Bali bombings]] in Indonesia were committed by various members of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]], an organization linked to Al-Qaeda.
* The [[2003 Casablanca bombings]] were carried out by [[Salafia Jihadia]], an Al-Qaeda affiliate.
* After the [[2003 Istanbul bombings]], Turkey charged 74 people with involvement, including Syrian Al-Qaeda member [[Loai al-Saqa]].
* The [[2004 Madrid train bombings]] in Spain were "inspired by" Al-Qaeda, though no direct involvement has been established.
* The [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] in the United Kingdom were perpetrated by four [[Homegrown terrorism|homegrown terrorists]], one of whom appeared in an edited video with a known Al-Qaeda operative, though the British government denies Al-Qaeda involvement.
* Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the [[11 April 2007 Algiers bombings]] in Algeria.
* The [[2007 Glasgow International Airport attack]] in the United Kingdom was carried out by a pair of bombers whose laptops and suicide notes included videos and speeches referencing Al-Qaeda, though no direct involvement was established.
* The [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]] in the United States was committed by [[Nidal Malik Hasan]], who had been in communication with [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], though the Department of Defense classifies the shooting as an incidence of workplace violence.
* Morocco blames Al-Qaeda for the [[2011 Marrakech bombing]], though Al-Qaeda denies involvement.
* The 2012 [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings]] in France were committed by Mohammed Merah, who reportedly had familial ties to Al-Qaeda, along with a history of petty crime and psychological issues. Merah claimed ties to Al-Qaeda, though French authorities deny any connection.
* To date, no one has been convicted for the 2012 [[U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi]] in Libya, and no one has claimed responsibility. Branches of Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda affiliates, and individuals "sympathetic to Al-Qaeda" are blamed.
* The gunmen in the 2015 [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]] in Paris identified themselves as belonging to Al-Qaeda's [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula|branch in Yemen]].

There may also have been several additional planned attacks that were not successful.

[[File:Liberty.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] helicopter patrols the airspace over New York City]]

In addition to military efforts abroad, in the aftermath of 9/11, the Bush Administration increased domestic efforts to prevent future attacks. Various government bureaucracies that handled security and military functions were reorganized. A new cabinet-level agency called the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] was created in November 2002 to lead and coordinate the largest reorganization of the U.S. federal government since the consolidation of the armed forces into the Department of Defense.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The Justice Department launched the [[National Security Entry-Exit Registration System]] for certain male non-citizens in the U.S., requiring them to register in person at offices of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].

The USA PATRIOT Act of October 2001 dramatically reduces restrictions on law enforcement agencies' ability to search telephone, e-mail communications, medical, financial, and other records; eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the United States; expands the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]'s authority to regulate financial transactions, particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities; and broadens the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism-related acts. The act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism, thus enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act's expanded law enforcement powers could be applied. A new [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]] monitored the movements of terrorists' financial resources (discontinued after being revealed by ''[[The New York Times]]''). Global telecommunication usage, including those with no links to terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/10/double-danger-nsa-surveillance |title=The double danger of the NSA's 'collect it all' policy on surveillance &amp;#124; Rachel Levinson-Waldman &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; is being collected and monitored through the [[NSA electronic surveillance program]]. The Patriot Act is still in effect.

Political interest groups have stated that these laws remove important restrictions on governmental authority, and are a dangerous encroachment on civil liberties, possible [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] violations of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. On 30 July 2003, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) filed the first legal challenge against Section 215 of the Patriot Act, claiming that it allows the [[FBI]] to violate a citizen's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, Fourth Amendment rights, and right to [[due process]], by granting the government the right to search a person's business, bookstore, and library records in a terrorist investigation, without disclosing to the individual that records were being searched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2003/august2003/firstpatriot.cfm |title=American Libraries – First Patriot Act Challenge Filed by ACLU |publisher=ALA |date=4 August 2003 |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122043434/http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2003/august2003/firstpatriot.cfm |archivedate=22 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, governing bodies in many communities have passed symbolic resolutions against the act.

In a speech on 9 June 2005, Bush said that the USA PATRIOT Act had been used to bring charges against more than 400 suspects, more than half of whom had been convicted. Meanwhile, the ACLU quoted Justice Department figures showing that 7,000 people have complained of abuse of the Act.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) began an initiative in early 2002 with the creation of the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, designed to promote information technologies that could be used in counter-terrorism. This program, facing criticism, has since been defunded by Congress.

By 2003, 12 major conventions and protocols were designed to combat terrorism. These were adopted and ratified by many states.

In 2005, the UN Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1624|Resolution 1624]] concerning incitement to commit acts of terrorism and the obligations of countries to comply with international human rights laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |title=UN Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611145715/http://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |archivedate=11 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both resolutions require mandatory annual reports on counter-terrorism activities by adopting nations, the United States and Israel have both declined to submit reports. In the same year, the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] issued a planning document, by the name "National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism", which stated that it constituted the "comprehensive military plan to prosecute the Global War on Terror for the [[Military of the United States|Armed Forces of the United States]]...including the findings and recommendations of the [[9/11 Commission]] and a rigorous examination with the Department of Defense".

On 9 January 2007, the House of Representatives passed a bill, by a vote of 299–128, enacting many of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission The bill passed in the U.S. Senate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00073|title=U.S. Senate: Roll Call Vote|date=27 January 2015|website=senate.gov|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a vote of 60–38, on 13 March 2007 and it was signed into law on 3 August 2007 by President Bush. It became Public Law 110-53. In July 2012, U.S. Senate passed a resolution urging that the [[Haqqani Network]] be designated a [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|foreign terrorist organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/us-cong-votes-for-designating-haqqani-network-as-terror-group/980665/|title= US Cong votes for designating Haqqani network as terror group| date= 28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Office of Strategic Influence]] was secretly created after 9/11 for the purpose of coordinating propaganda efforts but was closed soon after being discovered. The Bush administration implemented the [[Continuity of Operations Plan]] (or Continuity of Government) to ensure that U.S. government would be able to continue in catastrophic circumstances.

Since 9/11, extremists made various attempts to attack the United States, with varying levels of organization and skill. For example, vigilant passengers aboard a transatlantic flight prevented [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard Reid]], in 2001, and [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], in 2009, from detonating an explosive device.

Other terrorist plots have been stopped by federal agencies using new legal powers and investigative tools, sometimes in cooperation with foreign governments.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Such thwarted attacks include:
* The [[2001 shoe bomb plot]]
* A plan to crash airplanes into the [[U.S. Bank Tower (Los Angeles)|U.S. Bank Tower]] (aka Library Tower) in Los Angeles
* The 2003 plot by [[Iyman Faris]] to blow up the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in New York City
* The [[2004 Financial buildings plot]], which targeted the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] buildings in Washington, D.C., the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and other financial institutions
* The 2004 [[Columbus Shopping Mall Bombing Plot]]
* The [[2006 Sears Tower plot]]
* The [[2007 Fort Dix attack plot]]
* The [[2007 John F. Kennedy International Airport attack plot]]
* The [[Najibullah Zazi|New York Subway Bombing Plot]] and [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]]

The Obama administration has promised the closing of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], increased the number of troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], and promised the withdrawal of its forces from [[War in Iraq|Iraq]].

==Transnational actions==
==="Extraordinary rendition"===

After the September 11 attacks, the United States government commenced a program of illegal "[[extraordinary rendition]]," sometimes referred to as "irregular rendition" or "forced rendition," the government-sponsored [[kidnapping|abduction]] and [[extrajudicial]] transfer of a person from one country to transferee countries, with the consent of transferee countries.&lt;ref name="54 countries"&gt;{{cite news |author=Max Fisher |title=A staggering map of the 54 countries that reportedly participated in the CIA's rendition program|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/02/05/a-staggering-map-of-the-54-countries-that-reportedly-participated-in-the-cias-rendition-program/ |quote= |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=5 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/22/us-extraordinary-rendition-programme|title=New light shed on US government's extraordinary rendition programme|first1=Ian|last1=Cobain|first2=James|last2=Ball|date=22 May 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/cia-photographed-naked-detainees|title=CIA photographed detainees naked before sending them to be tortured|first=Spencer|last=Ackerman|date=28 March 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of extraordinary rendition is often conducting [[torture]] on the detainee that would be difficult to conduct in the U.S. legal environment, a practice known as [[torture by proxy]].

===Rendition to "Black Sites===
In 2005, ''The Washington Post'' and [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) published revelations concerning CIA kidnapping of detainees and their transport to "[[black site]]s," covert prisons operated by the CIA and whose existence is denied by the US government. The [[European Parliament]] published a report connecting use of such secret detention Black Sites for detainees kidnapped as part of extraordinary rendition (''[[Extraordinary rendition#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|See below]]''). Although some Black Sites have been known to exist inside [[European Union]] states, these detention centers violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|UN Convention Against Torture]], treaties that all EU member states are bound to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Europeans Probe Secret CIA Flights | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/16/AR2005111602198.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=17 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= EU to look into 'secret US jails' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4403166.stm | accessdate=18 December 2005 |publisher=BBC News  | date=3 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=U.S. Faces Scrutiny Over Secret Prisons | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/03/AR2005110300422.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=4 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ABC News]] two such facilities, in countries mentioned by Human Rights Watch, have been closed following the recent publicity with the CIA relocating the detainees. Almost all of these detainees were tortured as part of the "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]" of the CIA.&lt;ref name="AbcNews051205"&gt;{{cite news | title=Exclusive: Sources Tell ABC News Top Al Qaeda Figures Held in Secret CIA Prisons | url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1375123 | accessdate=18 December 2005 | publisher=ABC News | date=5 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major American newspapers, such as the "[[The Washington Post]]," have been criticized for deliberately withholding publication of articles reporting locations of Black Sites. The Post defended its decision to suppress this news on the ground that such revelations "could open the [[U.S. government]] to legal challenges, particularly in foreign courts, and increase the risk of political condemnation at home and abroad." However, according to [[Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting]] "the possibility that illegal, unpopular government actions might be disrupted is not a consequence to be feared, however—it's the whole point of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|U.S. First Amendment]]. ... Without the basic fact of where these prisons are, it's difficult if not impossible for 'legal challenges' or 'political condemnation' to force them to close." FAIR argued that the damage done to the global reputation of the United States by the continued existence of black-site prisons was more dangerous than any threat caused by the exposure of their locations.&lt;ref name="FAIR 2005"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Consequences of Covering Up | url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2715 | accessdate=18 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The complex at Stare Kiejkuty, a Soviet-era compound once used by German intelligence in World War II, is best known as having been the only Russian intelligence training school to operate outside the Soviet Union. Its prominence in the Soviet era suggests that it may have been the facility first identified—but never named—when the Washington Post's Dana Priest revealed the existence of the CIA's secret prison network in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Soviet-era compound in northern Poland was site of secret CIA interrogation, detentions | url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2007/Sovietera_compound_in_Poland_was_site_0307.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The journalists who exposed this provided their sources and this information and documents were provided to ''The Washington Post'' in 2005. In addition, they also identified such Black Sites are concealed:

{{quote|Former European and US intelligence officials indicate that the secret prisons across the European Union, first identified by the Washington Post, are likely not permanent locations, making them difficult to identify and locate.

What some believe was a network of secret prisons was most probably a series of facilities used temporarily by the United States when needed, officials say. Interim "black sites"—secret facilities used for covert activities—can be as small as a room in a government building, which only becomes a black site when a prisoner is brought in for short-term detainment and interrogation.}}

The journalists went on to explain that "Such a site, sources say, would have to be near an airport." The airport in question is the [[Szczytno-Szymany International Airport]].

In response to these allegations, former Polish intelligence chief, [[Zbigniew Siemiatkowski]], embarked on a media blitz and claimed that the allegations were "... part of the domestic political battle in the US over who is to succeed current Republican President George W Bush," according to the German news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Former Polish intelligence chief who says report on CIA detention site part of US domestic battle admitted CIA had access to facility | url=http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Former_Polish_intelligence_chief_who_says_0308.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prison ships ====
The United States has also been accused of operating "[[Prison ship|floating prisons]]" to house and transport those arrested in its [[war on terror#US objectives|''War on Terror'']], according to human rights lawyers. They have claimed that the US has tried to conceal the numbers and whereabouts of detainees. Although no credible information to support these assertions has ever come to light, the alleged justification for prison ships is primarily to remove the ability for jihadists to target a fixed location to facilitate the escape of high value targets, commanders, operations chiefs etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Duncan Campbell |author2=Richard Norton-Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/02/usa.humanrights |title=US accused of holding terror suspects on prison ships |work=The Guardian  |location=London |date= 2 June 2008|accessdate=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==

According to Joshua Goldstein, an [[international relations]] professor at the [[American University]], The Global War on Terror has seen fewer war deaths than any other decade in the past century.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Joshua S. [https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/08/15/think_again_war "Think Again: War"]. ''Foreign Policy Magazine'', 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no widely agreed on figure for the number of people that have been killed so far in the War on Terror as it has been defined by the Bush Administration to include the war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, and operations elsewhere. The [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]] and the Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Global Survival give total estimates ranging from {{nowrap|1.3 million}} to {{nowrap|2 million}} casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/study-1-3-million-killed-in-usa-war-on-terror/article/429180|title=Doctors' group says 1.3 million killed in U.S. 'War on Terror'|date=25 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study from 2018 by Brown University's [[Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs]] puts the total number of casualties of the War on Terror in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan between 480,000 and 507,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 9, 2018 |title=US 'war on terror' has killed over half a million people: study|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/wars-terror-killed-million-people-study-181109080620011.html|work=[[Al Jazeera]]|location= |access-date=November 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimates for regional conflicts include the following:

:*According to Marc W. Herold's extensive database,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mwherold/dossier |title=Dossier on Civilian Victims of United States' Aerial Bombing |publisher=Pubpages.unh.edu |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 3,100 and 3,600 civilians were directly killed by U.S. [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] bombing and Special Forces attacks between 7 October 2001 and 3 June 2003. This estimate counts only "impact deaths"—deaths that occurred in the immediate aftermath of an explosion or shooting—and does not count deaths that occurred later as a result of injuries sustained, or deaths that occurred as an indirect consequence of the U.S. airstrikes and invasion.

:*In an opinion article published in August 2002 in the magazine [[The Weekly Standard]], [[Joshua Muravchik]] of the [[American Enterprise Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2006/10/10/the_fp_memo_operation_comeback |title=The FP Memo: Operation Comeback – By Joshua Muravchik |publisher=Foreign Policy |date=10 October 2006 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; questioned Professor Herold's study entirely by one single incident that involved 25–93 deaths. He did not provide any estimate his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/001/565otmps.asp?pg=1 |title=The Prof Who Can't Count Straight |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=26 August 2002 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*In a pair of January 2002 studies, Carl Conetta of the Project on Defense Alternatives estimates that "at least" 4,200–4,500 civilians were killed by mid-January 2002 as a result of the war and Coalition airstrikes, both directly as casualties of the aerial bombing campaign, and indirectly in the resulting humanitarian crisis.

:*His first study, "Operation Enduring Freedom: Why a Higher Rate of Civilian Bombing Casualties?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0201oef.html |title=Operation Enduring Freedom: Why a Higher Rate of Civilian Bombing Casualties? |publisher=Comw.org |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; released 18 January 2002, estimates that, at the low end, "at least" 1,000–1,300 civilians were directly killed in the aerial bombing campaign in just the three months between 7 October 2001 to 1 January 2002. The author found it impossible to provide an upper-end estimate to direct civilian casualties from the [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] bombing campaign that he noted as having an increased use of [[cluster bombs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0201oef.html#1 |title=Operation Enduring Freedom: Why a Higher Rate of Civilian Bombing Casualties – Bombers and cluster bombs |publisher=Comw.org |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this lower-end estimate, only Western press sources were used for hard numbers, while heavy "reduction factors" were applied to Afghan government reports so that their estimates were reduced by as much as 75%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0201oef.html#appendix1 |title=Operation Enduring Freedom: Why a Higher Rate of Civilian Bombing Casualties – Appendix 1.

:*In similar numbers, a [[Los Angeles Times]] review of U.S., British, and Pakistani newspapers and international wire services found that between 1,067 and 1,201 direct civilian deaths were reported by those news organizations during the five months from 7 October 2001 to 28 February 2002. This review excluded all civilian deaths in Afghanistan that did not get reported by U.S., British, or Pakistani news, excluded 497 deaths that did get reported in U.S., British, and Pakistani news but that were not specifically identified as civilian or military, and excluded 754 civilian deaths that were reported by the Taliban but not independently confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/templates/misc/printstory.jsp?slug=la-060202bombs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020604082553/http://www.latimes.com/templates/misc/printstory.jsp?slug=la-060202bombs |archivedate=4 June 2002 |title='The Americans . . .

On December 7, 2015, the Washington Post reported that since 2001, in five theaters of the war (Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Somalia) that the total number of terrorists killed ranges from 65,800 to 88,600, with the Obama administration being responsible for between 30,000 and 33,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/07/president-obama-likes-to-brag-about-the-terrorists-he-has-taken-out-how-many-is-that-exactly/|title=How many terrorists has President Obama actually 'taken out'?

==Costs==
The War on Terror, spanning decades, is a multi-trillion-dollar war.

According to the Costs of War Project at [[Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs|Brown University's Watson Institute]], the War on Terror will have cost $5.6 trillion for operations between 2001-2018 plus anticipated future costs of veterans' care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Engelhardt|first1=Tom|title=America's 'War on Terror' Has Cost Taxpayers $5.6 Trillion|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/americas-war-on-terror-has-cost-taxpayers-5-6-trillion/|accessdate=20 May 2018|publisher=The Nation|date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Soufan Group in July 2015, the U.S. government was spending {{nowrap|$9.4 million}} per day in operations against ISIS in Syria and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://soufangroup.com/tsg-intelbrief-terrorism-in-the-horn-of-africa/|title = TSG IntelBrief: Terrorism in the Horn of Africa|date = 2015-07-28|accessdate = 2015-07-28|website = The Soufan Group|publisher = |location = New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of the War on Terror}}

[[File:World Can't Wait J4 Demo.jpg|thumb|Participants in a rally, dressed as hooded detainees]]

Criticism of the War on Terror addressed the issues, morality, efficiency, economics, and other questions surrounding the War on Terror and made against the phrase itself, calling it a [[misnomer]]. The notion of a "war" against "terrorism" has proven highly contentious, with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long-standing policy/military objectives,&lt;ref name="Monbiot2003"&gt;[[George Monbiot]], [http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2003/03/11/a-wilful-blindness "A Wilful Blindness"] ("Those who support the coming war with Iraq refuse to see that it has anything to do with US global domination"), ''monbiot.com'' (author's website archives), reposted from ''[[The Guardian]]'', 11 March 2003. Retrieved 28 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; reduce [[civil liberties]],&lt;ref name="Wired-FBI"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/03/fbi-tried-to-co/|title=FBI Tried to Cover Patriot Act Abuses With Flawed, Retroactive Subpoenas, Audit Finds|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=13 March 2008|work=Wired |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and infringe upon human rights. It is argued that the term war is not appropriate in this context (as in [[War on Drugs]]) since there is no identifiable enemy and that it is unlikely international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.&lt;ref name="Richissin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html |title="War on terror" difficult to define |last=Richissin |first=Todd |date=2 September 2004 |work=The Baltimore Sun |accessdate=28 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114085106/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html |archivedate=14 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics, such as [[Francis Fukuyama]], note that "[[Definition of terrorism|terrorism]]" is not an enemy, but a tactic; calling it a "war on terror", obscures differences between conflicts such as anti-occupation [[Insurgency|insurgents]] and international [[mujahideen]]. With a military presence in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and its associated collateral damage, [[Shirley Williams]] maintains this increases resentment and terrorist threats against the West.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Shirley.

==Other Wars on Terror==

In the 2010s, [[China]] has also been engaged in its own War on Terror, predominantly a domestic campaign in response to violent actions by [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] separatist movements in the [[Xinjiang conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/china/chinas-war-terror-september-11-uighur-separatism/p4765|title=China's 'War on Terror': September 11 and Uighur Separatism|date=|website=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign was widely criticized in international media due to the perception that it unfairly targets and [[persecutes]] [[Chinese Muslims]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/chinas-war-on-terror-becomes-all-out-attack-on-islam-in-xinjiang/2014/09/19/5c5840a4-1aa7-4bb6-bc63-69f6bfba07e9_story.html|title=China's war on terror becomes all-out attack on Islam in Xinjiang|author=Simon Denyer|date=19 September 2014|website=Washington Post|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially resulting in a negative backlash from [[China]]'s predominantly [[Muslim]] [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] population.

[[Russia]] has also been engaged on its own, also largely internally focused, counter-terrorism campaign often termed a war on terror, during the [[Second Chechen War]], the [[Insurgency in the North Caucasus]], and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2093529,00.html | work=Time | title=Breaking News, Analysis, Politics, Blogs, News Photos, Video, Tech Reviews - TIME.com | date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[China]]'s war on terror, [[Russia]]'s has also been focused on [[separatist]] and [[Islamist]] movements that use [[political violence]] to achieve their ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/demokratizatsiya%20archive/10-4_Cohen.PDF | title=Russia, Islam, and the War on Terrorism | first=Ariel | last=Cohen | accessdate=29 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
