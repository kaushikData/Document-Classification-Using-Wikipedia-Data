On 20 July 1944, [[Claus von Stauffenberg]] and other conspirators attempted to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Führer]] of [[Nazi Germany]], inside his [[Wolf's Lair]] field headquarters near [[Kętrzyn|Rastenburg]], [[East Prussia]]. The name [[Operation Valkyrie]]—originally referring to part of the conspiracy—has become associated with the entire event.

The apparent aim of the assassination attempt was to wrest political control of Germany and its armed forces from the [[Nazi Party]] (including the [[SS]]) and to make peace with the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] as soon as possible. The details of the conspirators' peace initiatives remain unknown,&lt;ref&gt;Hans Helmut Kirst "20th of July"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winston Churchill,war annual books, "1944"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William L. Shirer ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', part IV, chapter "20th July"&lt;/ref&gt; but they would have included unrealistic demands for the confirmation of Germany's extensive annexations of European territory.&lt;ref&gt; Klemens von Klemperer, ''German Resistance against Hitler: The Search for Allies Abroad 1938–1945''&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoffmann|1996|pp=608–609}}

The plot was the culmination of efforts by several groups in the [[German resistance]] to overthrow the Nazi German government. The failure of the assassination attempt and the intended military {{lang|fr|[[coup d'état]]}} that was to follow led the [[Gestapo]] to arrest more than 7,000&amp;nbsp;people, of whom they executed 4,980.&lt;ref name="shirer1393"&gt; According to Shirer, ''Führer Conferences on Naval Affairs'', 1960, p. 1393.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:1944-07-15GerWW2BattlefrontAtlas.jpg|thumb|300px|Battle fronts in Europe as of 15 July 1944]]
Since 1938, there had been groups plotting an overthrow of some kind within the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] and in the German [[Abwehr|Military Intelligence Organization]]. Early leaders of these plots included Major General [[Hans Oster]], Colonel General [[Ludwig Beck]] and Field Marshal [[Erwin von Witzleben]]. Oster was the deputy head of the Military Intelligence Office. Beck was a former Chief of Staff of the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|German Army High Command]] (OKH). Von Witzleben was the former commander of the [[1st Army (Wehrmacht)|German 1st Army]] and the former [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[OB West|German Army Command in the West]]. They soon established contacts with several prominent civilians, including [[Carl Goerdeler]], the former mayor of [[Leipzig]], and [[Helmuth James Graf von Moltke]], the great-grandnephew of [[Moltke the Elder]], hero of the [[Franco-Prussian War]].

Groups of military plotters exchanged ideas with civilian, political, and intellectual resistance groups in the [[Kreisau Circle|Kreisauer Kreis]] (which met at the [[Krzyzowa, Swidnica County|von Moltke estate in Kreisau]]) and in other secret circles. Moltke was against killing Hitler; instead, he wanted him placed on trial. Moltke said, "we are all amateurs and would only bungle it". Moltke also believed killing Hitler would be hypocritical. Hitler and National Socialism had turned "wrong-doing" into a system, something which the resistance should avoid.{{sfn|Kurtz|1946|p=224}}

Plans to stage an overthrow and prevent Hitler from launching a new world war were developed in 1938 and 1939, but were aborted because of the indecision of Army General [[Franz Halder]] and Field Marshal [[Walther von Brauchitsch]], and the failure of the Western powers to oppose Hitler's aggression until 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett 1967, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, a new conspiratorial group formed, led by Colonel [[Henning von Tresckow]], a member of Field Marshal [[Fedor von Bock]]'s staff, who commanded Army Group Centre in [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Tresckow systematically recruited oppositionists to the Group's staff, making it the nerve centre of the army resistance. Little could be done against Hitler as he was heavily guarded, and none of the plotters could get near enough to him.{{sfn|Kurtz|1946|p=226}}

During 1942, Oster and Tresckow nevertheless succeeded in rebuilding an effective resistance network. Their most important recruit was General [[Friedrich Olbricht]], head of the General Army Office headquarters at the [[Bendlerblock]] in central Berlin, who controlled an independent system of communications to reserve units throughout Germany. Linking this asset to Tresckow's resistance group in Army Group Centre created a viable coup apparatus.{{sfn|Fest|1997|p=188}}

In late 1942, Tresckow and Olbricht formulated a plan to assassinate Hitler and stage an overthrow during Hitler's visit to the headquarters of Army Group Centre at [[Smolensk]] in March 1943, by placing a bomb on his plane ([[Operation Spark (1940)|Operation Spark]]). The bomb failed to detonate, and a second attempt a week later with Hitler at an exhibition of captured Soviet weaponry in Berlin also failed. These failures demoralised the conspirators. During 1943 Tresckow tried without success to recruit senior army field commanders such as Field Marshal [[Erich von Manstein]] and Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], to support a seizure of power. Tresckow in particular worked on his Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Centre, Field Marshal [[Günther von Kluge]], to persuade him to move against Hitler and at times succeeded in gaining his consent, only to find him indecisive at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;von Schlabrendorff, Fabian, ''They Almost Killed Hitler'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite their refusals, none of the Field Marshals reported their treasonous activities to the [[Gestapo]] or Hitler.

=== Motivation and goals ===
While the main goal of the plotters was to remove Hitler from power, they did so for various reasons. The majority of the group behind the 20 July plot were conservative nationalists and did not necessarily believe in democratic ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Contemporary German Culture, "The heroes of West German accounts at this time were the men involved in the largely conservative, nationalist resistance of the July Plot of 1944. It was not until much later that a new generation of left-liberal historians pointed out just how little many of those involved in the July Plot actually sympathized with or understood democratic ideas. John Sandford. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Faith and Democracy: Political Transformations at the German Protestant Kirchentag", 1949—1969 Benjamin Carl Pearson 2007 
In a similar way, one could argue that the conservative, nationalist resistance circles that grew up during the war years, whose activity culminated in the July 1944 Officers Plot&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Borschat writes that the plot was mainly done by conservative elites who were initially integrated by the Nazi government but during the war lost their influence and were concerned about regaining it.{{sfn|Evans|2015|p=198}}

==== Territorial demands ====
Among demands issued by the plotters towards the Allies were such points as re-establishment of Germany's 1914 boundaries with Belgium, France and Poland and no reparations. Plotters' demands meant annexation to pre-1939 Germany of 70,000 square kilometers of non-German territory, especially the disputed Polish areas; it seems highly unlikely that the Allies would have accepted such enormous demands.&lt;ref&gt;Resistance and Conformity in the Third Reich Martyn Housden&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=April 2018}} Like most of the rest of German resistance, the July 20th plotters believed in the idea of [[Greater Germany]] and as a condition for peace demanded that the western allies recognize at minimum the Nazi annexations of Austria, Alsace-Lorraine, Sudetenland, and Polish territories, with even restoration of some of the overseas colonies. They believed that Europe should be controlled under German hegemony{{sfn|Evans|2015|pp=198–199}}

The overall goals towards Poland were mixed within the plotters. Most of the plotters found it desirable to restore the old German borders from 1914, while others pointed out that the demands were unrealistic and amendments had to be made.&lt;ref&gt;German Foreign Policy. By Klaus Hilderbrand page 185–188&lt;/ref&gt; Some like Friedrich-Werner Graf von der Schulenburg even wanted all of Poland annexed to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Alternatives to Hitler: German Resistance Under the Third Reich Hans Mommsen p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

To Poland, which was fighting as an ally with both its army and government in exile, the vast territorial demands and traditional nationalistic visions of resistance made the plotters lose all credibility, and Poles saw little difference between them and racist policies of Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;German Foreign Policy Klaus Hilderbrand, page 188&lt;/ref&gt; Stauffenberg, as one of the leaders of the plot, stated five years before the coup in 1939 during the [[invasion of Poland|Poland campaign]] about Poles and Poland: "It is essential that we begin a systemic colonisation in Poland. But I have no fear that this will not occur." &lt;ref&gt;Peter Hoffman Stauffenberg: A Family History, 1905–1944; page 116; 2003 McGill-Queen's Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;War of extermination page 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Political vision of post-Hitler Germany ====
Many members of the plot had helped the Nazis gain power and shared revisionist foreign policy goals pursued by Hitler, and even at the time of the plot were anti-democratic, hoping to replace Hitler with a conservative-authoritarian government, which would be ruled by elites. They opposed popular legitimation or mass participation in governance of the state.&lt;ref&gt;A Concise History of Germany page 200 Mary Fulbrook&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planning a coup ==
{{see also|List of members of the 20 July plot}}

=== Von Stauffenberg joins ===
By mid-1943, the tide of war was turning decisively against Germany. The army plotters and their civilian allies became convinced that Hitler should be assassinated, so that a government acceptable to the western Allies could be formed, and a separate peace negotiated in time to prevent a Soviet invasion of Germany. In August 1943, Tresckow met, for the first time, a young staff officer named Lieutenant Colonel [[Claus von Stauffenberg]]. Severely wounded in North Africa, Claus von Stauffenberg was a political conservative, a zealous German nationalist, and a Roman Catholic.

From early 1942, he had come to share two basic convictions with many military officers: that Germany was being led to disaster, and that Hitler's removal from power was necessary. After the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in December 1942, despite his religious scruples, he concluded that the Führer's assassination was a lesser moral evil than Hitler's remaining in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaminski|first1=Joseph|title=The Plots to Kill Hitler|url=http://josephkaminski.net/2015/02/16/the-plots-to-kill-hitler/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407163855/http://josephkaminski.net/2015/02/16/the-plots-to-kill-hitler/|archivedate=7 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stauffenberg brought a new tone of decisiveness to the ranks of the resistance movement. When Tresckow was assigned to the Eastern Front, Stauffenberg took charge of planning and executing the assassination attempt.

=== New plan ===
Olbricht now put forward a new strategy for staging a coup against Hitler. The [[Replacement Army]] (''Ersatzheer'') had an operational plan called [[Operation Valkyrie]], which was to be used in the event that the disruption caused by the Allied bombing of German cities caused a breakdown in law and order, or an uprising by the millions of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers from occupied countries]] now being used in German factories. Olbricht suggested that this plan could be used to mobilise the Reserve Army for the purpose of the coup.

In August and September 1943, Tresckow drafted the "revised" Valkyrie plan and new supplementary orders. A secret declaration began with these words: "The Führer Adolf Hitler is dead! A treacherous group of party leaders has attempted to exploit the situation by attacking our embattled soldiers from the rear in order to seize power for themselves." Detailed instructions were written for occupation of government ministries in Berlin, [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s headquarters in East Prussia, radio stations and telephone offices, and other Nazi apparatus through military districts, and concentration camps.{{sfn|Fest|1997|p=219}}

Previously, it was believed that Stauffenberg was mainly responsible for the Valkyrie plan, but documents recovered by the Soviet Union after the war and released in 2007 suggest that the plan was developed by Tresckow by autumn of 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Peter. [http://www.atypon-link.com/OLD/doi/pdf/10.1524/VfZg.2007.55.2.331 "Oberst i. G. Henning von Tresckow und die Staatsstreichpläne im Jahr 1943"]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; All written information was handled by Tresckow's wife, Erika, and by [[Margarethe von Oven]], his secretary. Both women wore gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints.{{sfn|Fest|1997|p=220}} On at least two other occasions Tresckow had tried to assassinate the Führer. The first plan was to shoot him during dinner at the army base camp, but this plan was aborted because it was widely believed that Hitler wore a bullet-proof vest. The conspirators also considered poisoning him, but this was not possible because his food was specially prepared and tasted. They concluded that a time bomb was the only option.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2007|p=241}}

Operation Valkyrie could only be put into effect by General [[Friedrich Fromm]], commander of the Reserve Army, so he must either be won over to the conspiracy or in some way neutralised if the plan was to succeed. Fromm, like many senior officers, knew in general about the military conspiracies against Hitler but neither supported them nor reported them to the Gestapo.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

=== Previous failed attempts ===
{{Main article|Operation Spark (1940)|List of assassination attempts on Adolf Hitler}}
During 1943 and early 1944 von Tresckow and von Stauffenberg organised at least five attempts to get one of the military conspirators near enough to Hitler, for long enough to kill him with hand grenades, bombs, or a revolver:
* on 13 March 1943 by [[Henning von Tresckow#Plots_against_Hitler|von Tresckow himself]]
* on 21 March 1943 by [[Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff]]
* in late November 1943 by [[Axel Freiherr von dem Bussche-Streithorst]]
* in February 1944 by [[Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin]]
* on 11 March 1944 by [[Eberhard von Breitenbuch|Eberhard Freiherr von Breitenbuch]]

As the war situation deteriorated, Hitler no longer appeared in public and rarely visited Berlin. He spent most of his time at his headquarters at the {{lang|de|[[Wolfsschanze]]}} near [[Rastenburg]] in [[East Prussia]], with occasional breaks at his [[Bavaria]]n mountain retreat [[Obersalzberg]] near [[Berchtesgaden]]. In both places he was heavily guarded and rarely saw people he did not know or trust. [[Himmler]] and the Gestapo were increasingly suspicious of plots against Hitler and rightly suspected the officers of the General Staff, which was indeed the source of many conspiracies against Hitler.

=== Preparations ===
By the summer of 1944, the Gestapo was closing in on the conspirators. When Stauffenberg sent Tresckow a message through Lieutenant [[Heinrich Graf von Lehndorff-Steinort]] asking whether there was any reason for trying to assassinate Hitler given that no political purpose would be served, Tresckow's response was: "The assassination must be attempted, ''coûte que coûte'' [whatever the cost]. Even if it fails, we must take action in Berlin. For the practical purpose no longer matters; what matters now is that the German resistance movement must take the plunge before the eyes of the world and of history. Compared to that, nothing else matters."{{sfn|Fest|1997|p=236}}

Himmler had at least one conversation with a known oppositionist when, in August 1943, the [[Prussia]]n Finance Minister [[Johannes Popitz]], who was involved in Goerdeler's network, came to see him and offered him the support of the opposition if he would make a move to displace Hitler and secure a negotiated end to the war.{{sfn|Fest|1997|p=228}} Nothing came of this meeting, but Popitz was not immediately arrested (although he was later executed towards the end of the war), and Himmler apparently did nothing to track down the resistance network which he knew was operating within the state bureaucracy. It is possible that Himmler, who by late 1943 knew that the war was unwinnable, allowed the plot to go ahead in the knowledge that if it succeeded he would be Hitler's successor, and could then bring about a peace settlement.

Popitz was not alone in seeing in Himmler a potential ally. General von Bock advised Tresckow to seek his support, but there is no evidence that he did so. Goerdeler was apparently also in indirect contact with Himmler via a mutual acquaintance, [[Carl Langbehn]]. [[Wilhelm Canaris]] biographer [[Heinz Höhne]] suggests that Canaris and Himmler were working together to bring about a change of regime, but this remains speculation.&lt;ref&gt;Himmler's contacts with the opposition and his possible motives are discussed by Padfield, ''Himmler'', pp. 419–424.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tresckow and the inner circle of plotters had no intention of removing Hitler just to see him replaced by the dreaded and ruthless SS chief, and the plan was to kill them both if possible – to the extent that Stauffenberg's first attempt on 11 July was aborted because Himmler was not present.

== Countdown to Stauffenberg's attempt ==

Bodenschatz was seriously wounded five days later by Stauffenberg's bomb. [[Rastenburg]], 15 July 1944.]]

=== First week of July ===
On Saturday, 1 July 1944 Stauffenberg was appointed chief of staff to General Fromm at the Reserve Army headquarters on Bendlerstraße in central Berlin. This position enabled Stauffenberg to attend Hitler's military conferences, either at the ''[[Wolfsschanze]]'' in [[East Prussia]] or at [[Berchtesgaden]], and would thus give him an opportunity, perhaps the last that would present itself, to kill Hitler with a bomb or a pistol. Meanwhile, new key allies had been gained. These included General [[Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel]], the German military commander in France, who would take control in Paris when Hitler was killed and, it was hoped, negotiate an immediate armistice with the invading Allied armies.

=== Aborted attempts ===
The plot was now fully prepared. On 7 July 1944 General [[Helmuth Stieff]] was to kill Hitler at a display of new uniforms at [[Schloss Klessheim|Klessheim castle]] near [[Salzburg]]. However, Stieff felt unable to kill Hitler. Stauffenberg now decided to do both: to assassinate Hitler, wherever he was, and to manage the plot in Berlin.

On 14 July Stauffenberg attended Hitler's conferences carrying a bomb in his briefcase, but because the conspirators had decided that [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Hermann Göring]] should be killed simultaneously if the planned mobilisation of Operation Valkyrie was to have a chance to succeed, he held back at the last minute because Himmler was not present. In fact, it was unusual for Himmler to attend military conferences.{{sfn|Kurtz|1946|p=226}}

By 15 July, when Stauffenberg again flew to the {{lang|de|Wolfsschanze}}, this condition had been dropped. The plan was for Stauffenberg to plant the briefcase with the bomb in Hitler's conference room with a timer running, excuse himself from the meeting, wait for the explosion, then fly back to Berlin and join the other plotters at the [[Bendlerblock]]. Operation Valkyrie would be mobilised, the Reserve Army would take control of Germany and the other Nazi leaders would be arrested. Beck would be appointed provisional head of state, Goerdeler would be chancellor, and Witzleben would be commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

Again on 15 July the attempt was called off at the last minute. Himmler and Göring were present, but Hitler was called out of the room at the last moment. Stauffenberg was able to intercept the bomb and prevent its discovery.{{sfn|Kurtz|1946|p=226}}

== 20 July 1944 ==

=== Operation Valkyrie ===

[[File:20 July Conference Room Floorplan.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Distribution of casualties]]
{{main|Operation Valkyrie}}
On 18 July rumours reached Stauffenberg that the Gestapo had knowledge of the conspiracy and that he might be arrested at any time—this was apparently not true, but there was a sense that the net was closing in and that the next opportunity to kill Hitler must be taken because there might not be another. In the morning of 20 July Stauffenberg flew back to the ''Wolfsschanze'' for another Hitler military conference, once again with a bomb in his briefcase.

At around 12:30&amp;nbsp;pm as the conference began, Stauffenberg made an excuse to use a washroom in [[Wilhelm Keitel]]'s office where he used pliers to crush the end of a [[pencil detonator]] inserted into a {{convert|1|kg|lb}} block of [[plastic explosive]] wrapped in brown paper, that was prepared by [[Wessel von Freytag-Loringhoven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geopolintelligence.com/6-assassination-attempts-on-hitler/|title=6 assassination attempts on Hitler|date=28 August 2015|publisher=Geopol Intelligence|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detonator consisted of a thin copper tube containing copper chloride that would take about ten minutes to silently eat through wire holding back the [[firing pin]] from the [[percussion cap]]. It was slow going due to war wounds that had cost Stauffenberg an eye, his right hand, and two fingers on his left hand. Interrupted by a guard knocking on the door advising him that the meeting was about to begin, he was not able to prime the second bomb, which he gave to his {{lang|fr|aide-de-camp}}, [[Werner von Haeften]].

Stauffenberg placed the single primed bomb inside his briefcase and, &lt;span&gt;with the unwitting assistance of Major &lt;/span&gt;[[Ernst John von Freyend]]&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;entered the conference room containing Hitler and 20 officers, positioning the briefcase under the table near Hitler.&lt;ref name=GermanResistance&gt;{{Cite book|year=1996|first=Peter|last=Hoffman |isbn=0773515313|title=The History of the German Resistance, 1933–1945|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GermanOpposition&gt;{{Cite book |year=1997|author=Thomsett, Michael C. |isbn=0786403721|title=The German Opposition to Hitler: The Resistance, the Underground, and Assassination Plots, 1938–1945 |publisher=McFarland}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few minutes, Stauffenberg received a planned telephone call and left the room. It is presumed that Colonel [[Heinz Brandt]], who was standing next to Hitler, used his foot to move the briefcase aside by pushing it behind the leg of the conference table,&lt;ref name=spiegel12h/&gt;&lt;!--"Heinz Brandt schiebt sie wohl mit dem Fuß noch ein Stück zur Seite - hinter die massive Stütze des schweren Lagetisches" "Heinz Brandt presumably pushed it a bit aside with his foot - behind the massive leg of the heavy conference table"--&gt; thus unwittingly deflecting the blast from Hitler but causing his own demise and the loss of one of his legs when the bomb detonated.

At 12:42&lt;ref name=spiegel12h&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,309271,00.html Spiegel.de] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bomb detonated, demolishing the conference room and killing a stenographer. More than 20 people were injured with three officers later perishing. Hitler survived, as did everyone else who was shielded from the blast by the conference table leg. His trousers were singed and tattered (see photograph below) and he suffered from a perforated eardrum, as did most of the other 24 people in the room.&lt;ref name=spiegel12h/&gt;&lt;!--"Fast allen 24 Anwesenden, auch Hitler, zerfetzt es die Trommelfelle. ..

=== Escape from the Wolf's Lair and flight to Berlin ===
Stauffenberg was seen leaving the conference building by Kurt Salterberg, a soldier on guard duty who did not consider this out of the ordinary as attendees sometimes left to collect documents. He then saw a "massive" cloud of smoke, wood splinters and paper and men being hurled through a window and door.&lt;ref name=dw&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/germany-remembers-the-plot-to-kill-hitler/a-17792469 Germany remembers the plot to kill hitler at dw]. Retrieved 22 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Stauffenberg, upon witnessing the explosion and smoke, erroneously assumed that Hitler was truly dead. He then climbed into a staff car with his aide [[Werner von Haeften]] and managed to bluff his way past three checkpoints to exit the {{lang|de|Wolfsschanze}} complex. Werner von Haeften then tossed the second unprimed bomb into the forest as they made a dash for Rastenburg airfield, reaching it before it could be realised that Stauffenberg could be responsible for the explosion. By 13:00 he was airborne in a [[Heinkel He 111]]&lt;ref name=Sereny&gt;{{cite book|date=9 August 1996|author=Gitta Sereny|isbn=0330346970|title=Albert Speer His Battle With The Truth|publisher=Picador}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite book|year=2005|author=Martin A.

By the time Stauffenberg's aircraft reached Berlin about 16:00,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ondemand-mp3.dradio.de/file/dradio/2010/07/20/dlf_20100720_1423_950da222.mp3 German radio broadcast 10 July 2010]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} on [[Deutschlandfunk]] (MP3; in German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.br-online.de/bayern1/mittags-in-mainfranken/regionalnews-frankenmagazin-stauffenberg-ID1279545336073.xml German radio broadcast 10 July 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605073429/http://www.br-online.de/bayern1/mittags-in-mainfranken/regionalnews-frankenmagazin-stauffenberg-ID1279545336073.xml |date=5 June 2011 }} on [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|Bayern1]] (written version; in German)&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Erich Fellgiebel]], an officer at the {{lang|de|Wolfsschanze}} who was in on the plot, had phoned the [[Bendlerblock]] and told the plotters that Hitler had survived the explosion. As a result, the plot to mobilise Operation Valkyrie would have no chance of succeeding once the officers of the Reserve Army knew that Hitler was alive. There was more confusion when Stauffenberg's aircraft landed and he phoned from the airport to say that Hitler was in fact dead.{{sfn|Kurtz|1946|p=227}} The Bendlerblock plotters did not know whom to believe.

Finally at 16:00 Olbricht issued the orders for Operation Valkyrie to be mobilised. The vacillating General Fromm, however, phoned Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] at the Wolf's Lair and was assured that Hitler was alive. Keitel demanded to know Stauffenberg's whereabouts. This told Fromm that the plot had been traced to his headquarters, and that he was in mortal danger. Fromm replied that he thought Stauffenberg was with Hitler.{{sfn|Galante|Silianoff|1991|pp=11–12}}

Meanwhile, [[Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel]], military governor of [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupied France]], managed to disarm the SD and SS, and captured most of their leadership. He travelled to [[Günther von Kluge]]'s headquarters and asked him to contact the Allies, only to be informed that Hitler was alive.{{sfn|Kurtz|1946|p=227}} At 16:40 Stauffenberg and Haeften arrived at the Bendlerblock. Fromm, presumably to protect himself, changed sides and attempted to have Stauffenberg arrested. Olbricht and Stauffenberg restrained him at gunpoint and Olbricht then appointed General [[Erich Hoepner]] to take over his duties.

By this time Himmler had taken charge of the situation and had issued orders countermanding Olbricht's mobilisation of Operation Valkyrie. In many places the coup was going ahead, led by officers who believed that Hitler was dead. City Commandant, and conspirator, [[Paul von Hase|General Paul von Hase]] ordered the {{lang|de|[[Grossdeutschland Division|Wachbataillon Großdeutschland]]}}, under the command of [[Otto Ernst Remer|Major Otto Ernst Remer]], to secure the [[Wilhelmstraße]] and arrest [[Reichs Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]].{{sfn|Galante|Silianoff|1991|p=209}} In [[Vienna]], Prague, and many other places troops occupied Nazi Party offices and arrested [[Gauleiter]]s and SS officers.

=== Failure of the coup ===
{{see also|List of people killed or wounded in the 20 July plot}}
At around 18:00, the commander of Military District III (Berlin), General [[Joachim von Kortzfleisch]], was summoned to the [[Bendlerblock]]; he angrily refused Olbricht's orders, kept shouting "the Führer is alive",{{sfn|Hoffmann|1996|p=426}} was arrested and was held under guard. General [[Karl Freiherr von Thüngen]] was appointed in his place, but proved to be of little help. General [[Fritz Lindemann]], who was supposed to make a proclamation to the German people over the radio, failed to appear and as he held the only copy, Beck had to work on a new one.{{sfn|Fest|1997|pp=270–272}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-109-19A, Berlin, Soldaten und Waffen-SS im "Bendlerblock".jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Soldiers and Waffen SS men at the [[Bendlerblock]], July 1944]]
At 19:00, Hitler was sufficiently recovered to make phone calls. He called Goebbels at the Propaganda Ministry. Goebbels arranged for Hitler to speak to Major Remer, commander of the troops surrounding the Ministry. After assuring him that he was still alive, Hitler ordered Remer to regain control of the situation in Berlin. Major Remer ordered his troops to surround and seal off the Bendlerblock, but not to enter the buildings.{{sfn|Galante|Silianoff|1991|p=209}} At 20:00 a furious Witzleben arrived at the Bendlerblock and had a bitter argument with Stauffenberg, who was still insisting that the coup could go ahead. Witzleben left shortly afterwards. At around this time the planned seizure of power in Paris was aborted when Field Marshal [[Günther von Kluge]], who had recently been appointed commander-in-chief in the west, learned that Hitler was alive.

As Remer regained control of the city and word spread that Hitler was still alive, the less resolute members of the conspiracy in Berlin began to change sides. Fighting broke out in the Bendlerblock between officers supporting and opposing the coup, and Stauffenberg was wounded. By 23:00 Fromm had regained control, hoping by a show of zealous loyalty to save himself. Beck, realising the situation was hopeless, shot himself—the first of many attempted suicides in the coming days. At first Beck only seriously wounded himself—he was then shot in the neck and killed by soldiers.

Fromm convened an impromptu [[court martial]] consisting of himself, and sentenced Olbricht, Stauffenberg, Haeften and another officer, [[Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim]], to death. At 00:10 on 21 July they were executed in the courtyard outside, possibly to prevent them from revealing Fromm's involvement.{{sfn|Kurtz|1946|p=227}} Others would have been executed as well, but at 00:30 SS personnel led by [[Otto Skorzeny]] arrived and further executions were forbidden. The original order given from Hitler to Remer was to capture the members of the conspiracy alive.

Over the following weeks, Himmler's Gestapo, driven by a furious Hitler, rounded up nearly everyone who had the remotest connection with the plot. The discovery of letters and diaries in the homes and offices of those arrested revealed the plots of 1938, 1939, and 1943, and this led to further rounds of arrests, including that of [[Franz Halder]], who finished the war in a concentration camp. Under Himmler's new {{lang|de|[[Sippenhaft]]}} (blood guilt) laws, many relatives of the principal plotters were also arrested in the immediate aftermath of the failed plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxHxaq6sMroC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Sippenhaft&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjriIiL39zdAhVFSK0KHSA-CwkQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Sippenhaft&amp;f=false|title=Family Punishment in Nazi Germany: Sippenhaft, Terror and Myth|last=Loeffel|first=Robert|date=2012-05-29|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230343054|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 7,000 people were arrested&lt;ref&gt;The Gestapo claimed 7,000 arrests. This can be found in [[William L. Shirer]]'s ''[[Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'', ch.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt; and 4,980 were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian. ''Hitler 1936–1945: Nemesis'', p. 693.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of them were connected with the plot, since the Gestapo used the occasion to settle scores with many other people suspected of opposition sympathies. [[Alfons Heck]], former Hitler Youth member and later a historian, describes the reaction many Germans felt to the punishments of the conspirators:

{{quote|When I heard that German officers had tried to kill Adolf Hitler ... I was enraged. I fully concurred with the sentences imposed on them, strangling I felt was too good for them; this was the time, precisely, when we were at a very ... precarious military situation. And the only man who could possibly stave off disaster ... was Adolf Hitler. That opinion was shared by many Germans, Germans who did not adore Hitler, who did not belong to the [Nazi] Party.}}

The British radio also named possible suspects who had not yet been implicated but then were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Tatiana von Metternich-Winneburg|Metternich, Tatiana]]|title=Purgatory of Fools|publisher=Quadrangle |year=1976|page=202|isbn=0812906918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few of the plotters tried to escape or to deny their guilt when arrested. Those who survived interrogation were given perfunctory trials before the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]], a [[kangaroo court]] that always decided in favour of the prosecution. The court's president, [[Roland Freisler]], was a fanatical Nazi seen shouting furiously and insulting the accused in the trial, which was filmed for propaganda purposes. The plotters were stripped of their uniforms and given old, shabby clothing to humiliate them for the cameras.&lt;ref name="See Shirer 1070-1071"&gt;See Shirer 1070–1071.&lt;/ref&gt; The officers involved in the plot were "tried" before the Court of Military Honour, a [[drumhead court-martial]] that merely considered the evidence furnished to it by the Gestapo before expelling the accused from the Army in disgrace and handing them over to the People's Court.&lt;ref name="RiseFall"&gt;William Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' (Touchstone Edition) (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first trials were held on 7 and 8 August 1944. Hitler had ordered that those found guilty should be "hanged like cattle".&lt;ref name="See Shirer 1070-1071"/&gt; Many people took their own lives prior to either their trial or their execution, including Kluge, who was accused of having knowledge of the plot beforehand and not revealing it to Hitler. Stülpnagel tried to commit suicide, but survived and was hanged.

Tresckow killed himself the day after the failed plot by use of a hand grenade in no man's land between Russian and German lines. According to post-war recollections of [[Fabian von Schlabrendorff]], Tresckow said the following before his death:
{{quote|The whole world will vilify us now, but I am still totally convinced that we did the right thing. Hitler is the archenemy not only of Germany but of the world. When, in few hours' time, I go before God to account for what I have done and left undone, I know I will be able to justify what I did in the struggle against Hitler. None of us can bewail his own death; those who consented to join our circle put on the [[Shirt of Nessus|robe of Nessus]]. A human being's moral integrity begins when he is prepared to sacrifice his life for his convictions.{{sfn|Fest|1997|pp=289–290}}}}

Fromm's attempt to win favour by executing Stauffenberg and others on the night of 20 July had merely exposed his own previous lack of action and apparent failure to report the plot. Having been arrested on 21 July, Fromm was later convicted and sentenced to death by the People's Court. Despite his knowledge of the conspiracy, his formal sentence charged him with poor performance in his duties. He was executed in [[Brandenburg an der Havel]]. Hitler personally commuted his death sentence from hanging to the "more honourable" firing squad. [[Erwin Planck]], the son of the famous physicist [[Max Planck]], was executed for his involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Alleged July Plot Conspirators Executed in Plötzensee Prison |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Plotzensee1.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5glwSeWmw?url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Plotzensee1.html |archivedate=14 May 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=19 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Heideking|first=Jürgen |author2=Mauch, Christof

A member of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] convicted of participating in the plot was [[Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf]], who was the {{lang|de|[[Ordnungspolizei|Orpo]]}} Police Chief of Berlin and had been in contact with members of the resistance since before the war. Collaborating closely with [[Arthur Nebe]], he was supposed to direct all police forces in Berlin to stand down and not interfere in the military actions to seize the government. However, his actions on 20 July had little influence on the events. For his involvement in the conspiracy, he was later arrested, convicted of treason and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Harrison: ''"Alter Kämpfer" im Widerstand. Graf Helldorff, die NS-Bewegung und die Opposition gegen Hitler.'' Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte [http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/1997_3.pdf 45(1997)] (PDF, 6,5 MB), p. 385–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 3 February 1945, when Freisler was killed in an American air raid, there were no more formal trials, but as late as April, with the war weeks away from its end, Canaris' diary was found, and many more people were implicated. Executions continued to the last days of the war.

Hitler took his survival to be a "divine moment in history", and commissioned a special decoration to be made for each person wounded or killed in the blast. The result was the [[Wound Badge]] of 20 July 1944. The badges were struck in three values: gold, silver, and black (the colors denoted the severity of the wounds received by each recipient). A total of 100 badges were manufactured,&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Adrian (1993). ''Guide to Third Reich German Awards...And Their Values'' (2nd Ed.) San Jose, CA: R. James Bender. {{ISBN|9780912138398}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 47 are believed to have actually been awarded. Each badge was accompanied by an ornate award document personally signed by Hitler. The badges themselves bore a facsimile of his signature, making them among the rarest [[List of military decorations of Nazi Germany|decorations to have been awarded by Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Angolia, John R. (1976). ''For Führer and Fatherland: Military Awards of the Third Reich'' (1st Ed.) San Jose, CA: R. James Bender. {{oclc|2853647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his role in stopping the coup, Major Remer was promoted to colonel and ended the war as a major general. After the war, he co-founded the [[Socialist Reich Party]] and remained a prominent [[Neo-Nazi]] and advocate of [[Holocaust Denial]] until his death in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hdot.org/en/denial/biographies Holocaust Denial on Trial: Using History to Confront Distortions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918111359/http://www.hdot.org/en/denial/biographies |date=18 September 2009 }}.

[[Philipp von Boeselager]], the German officer who provided the plastic explosives used in the bomb, escaped detection and survived the war. He was the second-to-last survivor of those involved in the plot and died on 1 May 2008, aged 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Hitler plot survivor dies aged 90|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7380365.stm |publisher=BBC News Online|location = London|date = 2 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last survivor of the 20 July Plot was [[Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin]], the thwarted plotter of just a few months before.

As a result of the failed coup, every member of the {{lang|de|[[Wehrmacht]]}} was required to reswear his loyalty oath, by name, to Hitler and, on 24 July 1944, the military salute was replaced throughout the armed forces with the [[Hitler Salute]] in which the arm was outstretched and the salutation {{lang|de|Heil Hitler}} was given.{{sfn|Büchber|1991}}

== Planned government ==
The conspirators were earlier designated positions in secret to form a government that would take office after the assassination of Hitler were it to prove successful. Because of the plot's failure, such a government never rose to power and most of its members were executed. 

The following were slated for these roles as of July 1944:{{sfn|Hoffmann|1996|p=367}}
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* [[Ludwig Beck]] – [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|President]]

* [[Josef Wirmer]] – Minister of Justice
* [[Bernhard Letterhaus]] – Reconstruction Minister
* [[Henning von Tresckow]] – Chief of Police
{{div end}}

[[Albert Speer]] was listed in several notes of the conspirators as a possible Minister of Armaments; however, most of these notes stated Speer should not be approached until after Hitler was dead and one conjectural government chart had a question mark beside Speer's name. This most likely saved Speer from arrest by the SS in addition to Speer being one of Hitler's closest and most trusted friends.&lt;ref&gt;Speer, Albert. ''Inside the Third Reich''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Erwin Rommel's involvement ==
The extent of Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]]'s involvement in the military's [[German resistance to Nazism|resistance against Hitler]] or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain, as people most directly involved did not survive and limited documentation on the conspirators' plans and preparations exists. Thus, Rommel's participation remains ambiguous and the perception of it largely has its source in the subsequent events (especially Rommel's forced suicide) and the accounts by surviving participants.{{sfn|Beckett|2014|p=6}}
 
According to a post-war account by [[Karl Strölin]], the {{lang|de|Oberbürgermeister}} of Stuttgart at that time, he and two other conspirators, [[Alexander von Falkenhausen]] and [[Carl Heinrich von Stülpnagel]] began efforts to bring Rommel into the anti-Hitler conspiracy in early 1944.{{sfn|Shirer|2011|pp=1031, 1177}} On 15 April 1944 Rommel's new chief of staff, [[Hans Speidel]], arrived in Normandy and reintroduced Rommel to Stülpnagel.{{sfn|Hart|2014|pp=142–150}} Speidel had previously been connected to [[Carl Goerdeler]], the civilian leader of the resistance, but not to the plotters led by Stauffenberg, and only came to the attention of Stauffenberg due to his appointment to Rommel's headquarters. The conspirators felt they needed the support of a field marshal on active duty. Witzleben was a field marshal, but had not been on active duty since 1942. The conspirators gave instructions to Speidel to bring Rommel into their circle.{{sfn|Hart|2014|pp=139–142}}

Speidel met with former foreign minister [[Konstantin von Neurath]] and Strölin on 27 May in Germany, ostensibly at Rommel's request, although the latter was not present. Neurath and Strölin suggested opening immediate surrender negotiations in the West, and, according to Speidel, Rommel agreed to further discussions and preparations.{{sfn|Hart|2014|p=146}} Around the same timeframe, however, the plotters in Berlin were not aware that Rommel had reportedly decided to take part in the conspiracy. On 16 May, they informed [[Allen Dulles]], through whom they hoped to negotiate with the Western Allies, that Rommel could not be counted on for support.{{sfn|Hart|2014|pp=145–146}} Three days before the assassination attempt, on 17 July, Rommel's staff car was strafed by an Allied aircraft in France; he was hospitalised with major injuries and incapacitated on 20 July.

Rommel opposed assassinating Hitler. After the war, his widow maintained that he believed an assassination attempt would spark a civil war.{{sfn|Hart|2014|p=140}} According to journalist and author [[William L. Shirer]], Rommel knew about the conspiracy and advocated that Hitler be arrested and placed on trial. The historian Ian Becket argues that "there is no credible evidence that Rommel had more than limited and superficial knowledge of the plot" and concludes that he would not have acted to aid the plotters in the aftermath of the attempt on 20 July,{{sfn|Beckett|2014|p=6}} while the historian Ralf Georg Reuth contends that "there was no indication of any active participation of Rommel in the conspiracy."{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=tbd}} Historian [[Richard J. Evans]] concluded that he knew of a plot, but was not involved.{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=642}}

What is not debated are the results of the failed bomb plot of 20 July. Many conspirators were arrested and the dragnet expanded to thousands.{{sfn|Hart|2014|p=152}} Consequently, it did not take long for Rommel to come under suspicion. He was primarily implicated through his connection to Kluge.{{sfn|Beckett|2014|p=6}} Rommel's name also came up in confessions made under torture by Stülpnagel and Hofacker, and was included in Goerdeler's papers on a list of potential supporters.{{sfn|Hart|2014|pp=141, 152}}{{sfn|Reuth|2005|p=183}} Hofacker confessed that Rommel had agreed to demand for Hitler to step down, and if he refused, Rommel would join the other conspirators in deposing Hitler. Rommel was also planned to become a member of the post-Hitler government in papers drawn up by Goerdeler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Nigel H. |author-link=Nigel H.

Hitler knew it would cause a major scandal on the home front to have the popular Rommel publicly branded as a traitor. With this in mind, he opted to give Rommel the option of suicide via cyanide or a public trial by Freisler's People's Court. Rommel was well aware that being hauled before the People's Court was tantamount to a death sentence. He also knew that if he chose to stand trial, his family [[Sippenhaft|would have been severely punished]] even before the all-but-certain conviction and execution. With this in mind, he committed suicide on 14 October 1944. He was buried with full military honours and his family was spared from persecution; his cause of death did not come to light until after the war.{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=642}}

== Criticism ==

=== Involvement in war crimes and atrocities ===
Involvement of the plotters in war crimes and atrocities has been studied by historians such as [[Christian Gerlach]].&lt;ref&gt;Men of 20 July and the war in the Soviet Union. [[Hannes Heer]], [[Klaus Naumann (historian)|Klaus Naumann]] (eds.): War Of Extermination: The German Military In World War II, [[Berghahn Books]]; New york, Oxford, 2004, 127–145&lt;/ref&gt; Gerlach proved that plotters like Tresckow or Gersdorff were aware of mass murder happening in the East from at least 1941. He writes: "Especially with reference to the murder of the Jews, [it is said that] 'the SS' had deceived the officers by killing in secret, filing incomplete reports or none at all; if general staff offices protested, the SS threatened them." Gerlach concludes: "This is, of course, nonsense."

Tresckow also "signed orders for the deportation of thousands of orphaned children for forced labor in the Reich"—the so-called {{lang|de|[[Heu-Aktion]]}}. Such actions lead historians to question the motives of the plotters, which seemed more concerned with the military situation than with Nazi atrocities and German war crimes. However some others assert that, in such actions, Tresckow had to act out of principle to continue with his coup plans.&lt;ref&gt;The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany Roderick Stackelberg page 250&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerlach pointed out that the plotters had "selective moral criteria" and while they were concerned about Jews being exterminated in the [[Holocaust]], they were far less disturbed about mass murder of civilians in the East.&lt;ref name="Century page 134"&gt;Christianity and Resistance in the 20th Century: From Kaj Munk and Dietrich Bonhoeffer to Desmond Tutu (International Studies in Religion and Society Series) page 134 and 135, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; To Gerlach, the primary motivation of the plotters was to ensure German victory in the war or at least prevent defeat.&lt;ref name="Century page 134"/&gt; Gerlach's arguments were later supported by historian [[Hans Mommsen]], who stated that the plotters were interested above all in military victory.&lt;ref&gt;Christianity and Resistance in the 20th Century: From Kaj Munk and Dietrich Bonhoeffer to Desmond Tutu (International Studies in Religion and Society Series) page 135, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Germany: 1933–1990 – Page 96 Heinrich August Winkler – 2007&lt;/ref&gt; But Gerlach's arguments were also criticized by some scholars, among them [[Peter Hoffmann (historian)|Peter Hoffmann]] from [[McGill University]] and {{ill|Klaus Jochen Arnold|de}} from the [[Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung]]. While acknowledging that Tresckow and other 20 July conspirators had been involved in war crimes, Arnold writes that Gerlach's argument is oversimplifed.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hoffmann, Carl Goerdeler and the Jewish question, 1933–1942, Cambridge ; New York : Cambridge University Press, 2011, xvi.&lt;br&gt;Klaus Jochen Arnold, [http://www.zeitgeschichte-online.de/sites/default/files/media/20juli_arnold.pdf Verbrecher aus eigener Initiative? Der 20. Juli 1944 und die Thesen Christian Gerlachs]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemoration and collective memory ==
A 1951 survey by the [[Allensbach Institute]] revealed that "Only a third of respondents had a positive opinion about the men and women who had tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Nazi regime."&lt;ref name = "dwelle2014"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Dittrich| first = Monika| title = How traitors became heroes| work = [[Deutsche Welle]]| accessdate = 2014-07-20| date = 2014-07-20| url = http://www.dw.de/how-traitors-became-heroes/a-17796469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "first official memorial service for the resistance fighters of July 20" was held on the tenth anniversary in 1954. In his speech at the event, [[Theodor Heuss]], the first [[President of Germany|President of the Federal Republic of Germany]], said that "harsh words" were necessary, and that "There have been cases of refusal to carry out orders that have achieved historic greatness."&lt;ref name = "dwelle2014" /&gt; After this speech, public opinion in Germany began to shift.

Nonetheless, a 1956 proposal to name a school after Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg was opposed by a majority of citizens, and, according to [[Deutsche Welle]],

{{quote|East Germany's communist leadership had ignored the assassination attempt for decades, mainly because the conservative and aristocratic conspirators around Stauffenberg did not match the socialist ideal.&lt;ref name = "dwelle2014" /&gt;}}

The first all-German commemoration of the event did not take place until 1990. In 2013, the last surviving member of the plot, Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin, died in [[Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/julyplot.html|title=Operation Valkyrie - The "July Plot" to Assassinate Hitler {{!}} Jewish Virtual Library|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the resistance fighters are generally considered heroes in Germany, according to Deutsche Welle.&lt;ref name = "dwelle2014" /&gt;

The '''2G spectrum case''' was an alleged scam by the politicians and government officials under the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (Congress) coalition government in India. The Union Government of that time was accused of undercharging [[mobile telephone]] companies for [[frequency allocation]] licenses, which they used to create [[2G]] [[Radio spectrum|spectrum]] subscriptions for cell phones. The Government chose NM Rothschild and Sons to design a first-of-its-kind e-auction mechanism in the world, a US$2.27 billion landmark deal. The difference between the money collected and that mandated to be collected was estimated by the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]] at {{INRConvert|1.76|t|nolink=yes}}, based on 2010 [[Indian Telecom Spectrum Auction|3G and BWA spectrum-auction]] prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cag.gov.in/sites/default/files/audit_report_files/Union_Performance_Civil_Allocation_2G_Spectrum_19_2010.pdf |title=Performance Audit Report on the Issue of Licences and Allocation of 2G Spectrum |accessdate = 5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a charge sheet filed on 2 April 2011 by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI), the loss was pegged at {{INRConvert|3098455|m|nolink=yes}}.&lt;ref name="Indiatimes 2G loss"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-07/india/30122800_1_spectrum-trai-2g|newspaper=Times of India | title=2G loss?

On 2 February 2012, the [[Supreme Court of India]] ruled on a [[Public interest litigation in India|Public Interest Litigation]] (PIL) related to the 2G spectrum allocation. The court declared the allotment of spectrum "unconstitutional and arbitrary", cancelling the 122 licenses issued in 2008 under [[A. Raja]], the [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (India)|Minister of Communications &amp; IT from 2007 to 2009]], the primary official accused.&lt;ref name="SC quashes 122 licences" /&gt; According to the court, Raja "wanted to favour some companies at the cost of the public exchequer" and "virtually gifted away important national asset[s]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2G verdict: A Raja 'virtually gifted away important national asset', says Supreme Court|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-02/india/31016547_1_2g-raja-swan-telecom|newspaper=Times of India | date=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zero-loss theory was discredited&lt;ref name="Cabinet decision on 2G auction price demolishes zero-loss theory" /&gt; on 3 August 2012 when, after a Supreme Court directive, the Government of India revised the base price for 5-MHz 2G spectrum auctions to {{INRConvert|140|b|nolink=yes}}, raising its value to about {{INRConvert|28|b|nolink=yes}} per MHz (near the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India|Comptroller and Auditor General]] estimate of {{INRConvert|33.5|b|nolink=yes}} per MHz).&lt;ref name="Cabinet sets Rs 14,000 cr as reserve price for 2G spectrum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Loss R.I.P.|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/article3742967.ece|work=The Hindu|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
India is divided into 22 telecommunications zones, with 281 zonal licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Factbox: India top court orders 200spaper=NDTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 122 new [[2G|second-generation 2G]] Unified Access Service (UAS) licenses were granted to telecom companies on a first-come, first-served basis at the 2001 price. According to the CBI charge sheet, several laws were violated and bribes were paid to favour certain firms in granting 2G spectrum licenses. According to a [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India|CAG]] audit, licenses were granted to ineligible corporations, those with no experience in the telecom sector (such as Unitech and Swan Telecom)&lt;ref name="What is 2G Scam"&gt;{{cite news|title=What is 2G scam |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/what-is-2g-spectrum-scam-66418|newspaper=NDTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those who had concealed relevant information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Here's how CAG report on 2G scam blasts Raja|url=http://www.rediff.com/business/slide-show/slide-show-1-tech-what-the-cag-report-on-2g-scam-says/20101116.htm|publisher=Rediff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although former [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]] advised Raja to allot 2G spectrum transparently and revise the license fee in a November 2007 letter, Raja rejected many of Singh's recommendations.&lt;ref name="Chronology of 2G scam"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-05-20/news/29564752_1_2g-spectrum-case-licence-fee|title=2G Spectrum Scam: Chronology of events|publisher=The Economic Times|date=2011-05-02|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another letter that month, the [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]] expressed procedural concerns to the [[Department of Telecommunications|DOT]];&lt;ref name="Chronology of 2G scam"/&gt; these were ignored, and the cut-off date was moved forward from 1 October to 25 September 2007.&lt;ref name="Chronology of 2G scam"/&gt;

In its ruling the court said that former telecom minister A. Raja "wanted to favour some companies at the cost of the public exchequer", listing seven steps he took to ensure this:&lt;ref name="SC quashes 122 licences"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=SC singles out Raja, says officers were cowed down|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sc-singles-out-raja-says-officers-were-cowed-down/907187/|newspaper=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# After becoming telecom minister, Raja directed that all applications for spectrum licences would be held pending [[Telecom Regulatory Authority of India]] recommendations.&lt;ref name="SC quashes 122 licences"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt;
# The 28 August 2007 TRAI recommendations were not presented to the full Telecom Commission, which would have included the finance secretary. Although the TRAI recommendations for allocation of 2G spectrum had serious financial implications (and finance ministry input was required under the Government of India Transaction of Business Rules, 1961), Telecom Commission non-permanent members were not notified of the meeting.&lt;ref name="SC quashes 122 licences"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt;
# The DoT officers attending 10 October 2007 Telecom Commission meeting were coerced into approving the TRAI recommendations, or they would have "incurred" Raja's "wrath".&lt;ref name="SC quashes 122 licences"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt;
# Since the Cabinet had approved the Group of Ministers recommendations, the DoT had to discuss the issue of spectrum pricing with the finance ministry. However, Raja did not consult the finance minister or other officials because the finance secretary had objected to allocating 2G spectrum at 2001 rates.&lt;ref name="SC quashes 122 licences"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt;
# Raja dismissed the law minister's suggestion that the issue should be presented to the Group of Ministers. After receiving the PM's 2 November 2007 letter suggesting transparency in spectrum allocation of the spectrum, Raja said it would be unfair, discriminatory, arbitrary and capricious to auction spectrum to new applicants because it would not give them a level playing field. Although a 24 September DoT press release said that 1 October would be the application deadline, he changed the deadline to 25 September. Raja's arbitrary action, "though appear[ing] to be innocuous was actually intended to benefit some of the real estate firms who did not have any experience in dealing with telecom services and who had made applications only on 24 September 2007, i.e. one day before the cut-off date fixed by the C&amp;IT minister on his own".&lt;ref name="SC quashes 122 licences"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt;
# The 25 September cut-off date decided by Raja on 2 November was not made public until a 10 January 2008 press release in which he changed the first-come, first-served principle which had been in operation since 2003. "This enabled some of the applicants, who had access either to the minister or DoT officers, get bank drafts prepared towards performance guarantee of about Rs 16&amp;nbsp;billion".&lt;ref name="SC quashes 122 licences"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt;
# "The manner in which the exercise for grant of LoIs to the applicants was conducted on 10 January 2008 leaves no room for doubt that everything was stage managed to favour those who were able to know in advance change in the implementation of the first-come-first-served policy." As a result, some companies who had submitted applications in 2004 or 2006 were pushed down the list in favour of those who had applied in August and September 2007.&lt;ref name="SC quashes 122 licences"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt;

==Aircel-Maxis deal controversy==
{{See also2|[[C Sivasankaran]]|[[Dayanidhi Maran]]|[[Tatparanandam Ananda Krishnan|T Ananda Krishnan]]|[[Maxis Communications]]}}
On 6 June 2011 former [[Aircel]] chief C. Sivasankaran complained to the CBI about not receiving a telecom licence and being forced by telecom minister [[Dayanidhi Maran]] to sell Aircel to the Malaysia-based [[Maxis Communications]] group, owned by T. Ananda Krishnan. The licences were allegedly issued after the deal was made. Sivasankaran also alleged that brothers Dayanidhi and [[Kalanithi Maran]] received kickbacks in the form of investments by the Maxis group through the Astro network in [[Sun TV Network]], owned by the Maran family.&lt;ref name="Aircel-Maxis deal: CBI books Dayanidhi Maran, brother"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maran booked, raided"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBI books Maran brothers in Aircel-Maxis deal, raids premises"/&gt; In the wake of the allegations, Maran resigned on 7 July.&lt;ref name="Dayanidhi Maran resigns from Union Cabinet"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dayanidhi Maran resigns from Union Cabinet|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-07-08/india/29751351_1_malaysian-telecom-firm-maxis-union-cabinet-resignation|accessdate=11 September 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October, the CBI registered a case and raided properties owned by the Marans. CBI sources said that although no evidence of coercion was found in the Aircel sale, they found substantial evidence that Maran had favoured the company's takeover by Maxis and deliberately delayed Sivasankar's files.&lt;ref name="Aircel-Maxis deal: CBI books Dayanidhi Maran, brother"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maran booked, raided"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBI books Maran brothers in Aircel-Maxis deal, raids premises"/&gt; On 8 February 2012, the Enforcement Directorate registered a money-laundering case against the Maran brothers&lt;ref name="ibnlive.in.com"/&gt; for allegedly receiving illegal compensation of about {{INR}}5.5&amp;nbsp;billion in the Aircel-Maxis deal.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"/&gt;

During the CBI probe Sivasankaran said that the Maran brothers had forced him to sell his 74% share in Aircel to Maxis by threatening his life, giving the CBI a list of over 10 witnesses. In September 2012, the CBI said it finished its Indian investigation and was awaiting the response to a [[letter rogatory]] sent to Malaysia and a questionnaire from T.

==Response to the allegations==
When Indian media began citing the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India|CAG]] report identifying the loss at {{INR}}1.76&amp;nbsp;trillion ([[Long and short scales|short scale]]), the Indian opposition parties unanimously demanded the formation of a [[joint parliamentary committee]] to investigate the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Opposition demands JPC |url=http://www.news24online.com/Opposition-demands-JPC-on-2G-scam_News24_17551.aspx |newspaper=News 24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193503/http://www.news24online.com/Opposition-demands-JPC-on-2G-scam_News24_17551.aspx |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ndtv.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=2G scam: Opposition chants 'we want JPC'; No, says Government|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/2g-scam-opposition-chants-we-want-jpc-no-says-government-66550|newspaper=NDTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the government rejected their demand,&lt;ref name="ndtv.com"/&gt; when the winter session of Parliament began on 9 November 2010 the opposition again pressed for a JPC; again, their demand was rejected.&lt;ref name="ndtv.com"/&gt; The demand for a JPC gained further momentum when the CAG report was tabled in Parliament on 16 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CAG report tabled in parliament|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/cag-report-in-parliament-today/135092-37-64.html|newspaper=IBN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition blocked the proceedings, again pressing for a JPC;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spectrum sparks fly, opposition blocks parliament|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/spectrum-sparks-fly-opposition-blocks-parliament.html|newspaper=Yahoo India News}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government again rejected their demand, creating an impasse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parliament logjam continues... 10, 13, 15, 18 days... |first=Sushmita |last=Dutta |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/zee-exclusive/parliament-logjam-continues-10-13-15-18-days_673057.html |newspaper=Zee News |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=23 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202137/http://zeenews.india.com/news/zee-exclusive/parliament-logjam-continues-10-13-15-18-days_673057.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Speaker of the Lok Sabha]] [[Meira Kumar]] unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the impasse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meira Kumar's bid to end 2G logjam fails|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-31/india/28238727_1_jpc-demand-cpi-leader-logjam|newspaper=Times of india}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winter session of Parliament concluded on 13 December 2010.

In June 2011 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh criticised the CAG for commenting on policy issues, warning it "to limit the office to the role defined in the constitution."&lt;ref name="pmhitsout"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-30/india/29720931_1_2g-telecom-minister-vinod-rai |title=PM hits out at CAG on 2G, oil firms |date=30 June 2011 |work=[[The Times of India]] |publisher=[[The Times Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Singh's criticism the CAG conducted a "rigorous internal appraisal" and stood by its findings, citing additional events as corroboration. The CAG reiterated that there was "an undeniable loss to the exchequer", the calculation of which was based on three estimates: the 3G auctions and the Swan and Unitech transactions. It cited the Supreme Court ruling of 2 February 2012 that the actions of Raja and officers at the Department of Telecom were "wholly arbitrary, capricious and contrary to the public interest, apart from being violative of the doctrine of equality. The material produced for the quote showed that the Minister for C&amp;IT wanted to favour some companies at the cost of the public exchequer." It said its estimate of loss of 1.76-lakh crore was justified, since the May 2012 TRAI collation of reserve prices for 2G spectrum was about the same as that in the November 2010 CAG report. TRAI had recommended a reserve price for 2G spectrum of {{INR}}180&amp;nbsp;billion for a pan-India 5&amp;nbsp;MHz licence, higher than the 3G value of {{INR}}167.50&amp;nbsp;billion for 5&amp;nbsp;MHz used by the CAG for arriving at a loss figure of {{INR}}1,760&amp;nbsp;billion. It concluded that it was only examining the "implementation of policy", and policy-making was the government's prerogative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3603229.ece|title=After rigorous self-appraisal, CAG sticks to its guns on 2G|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barbara Kruger''' (born January 26, 1945) is an American [[conceptual art]]ist and [[collage|collagist]].&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=July 19, 2000 |title=Barbara Kruger, Ad Industry Heroine |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/culturebox/2000/07/barbara_kruger_ad_industry_heroine.html |newspaper=Slate|access-date=January 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her work consists of black-and-white photographs, overlaid with declarative captions, stated in white-on-red [[Futura (typeface)|Futura Bold Oblique]] or [[Helvetica|Helvetica Ultra Condensed]] text. The phrases in her works often include pronouns such as "you", "your", "I", "we", and "they", addressing cultural constructions of power, identity, and sexuality. Kruger currently lives and works in New York and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/barbara-kruger "Barbara Kruger"] PBS, Retrieved 14 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next ten years, Kruger established herself whilst pursuing [[graphic design]] for magazines, [[Freelancer|freelance]] picture editing, as well as designing book jackets.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rogallery.com/Kruger_Barbara/kruger-biography.html|title=Barbara Kruger, American (1945- )|last=|first=|date=2017-03-17|website=Rhode Island Gallery|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the later 1960s, Kruger gained interest in poetry, and began attending [[poetry reading]]s and writings. Kruger studied art and design with [[Diane Arbus]] and [[Marvin Israel]] at [[Parsons School of Design]] in New York. Kruger soon obtained a design job at [[Condé Nast Publications]].&lt;ref name= PBS/&gt; There after, Kruger was awarded the head designer for that following year. She initially worked as a designer at [[Mademoiselle (magazine)|''Mademoiselle'']] and later moved on to work part-time as a picture editor at [[House &amp; Garden (magazine)|House and Garden]], [[Aperture]], and other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbarakruger.com/biography.shtml |title=Biography - Barbara Kruger - Photograph Collage, Advertising, Slogans, Art |publisher=Barbara Kruger |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote film, television, and music columns for ''[[Artforum]]'' and ''Real Life Magazine'' at the suggestion of her friend [[Ingrid Sischy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kruger's earliest works date back to 1969. These works were large wall hangings made out of different materials such as yarn, beads, sequins, feathers and ribbons. These pieces represented the feminist recuperation of craft during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rogallery.com/Kruger_Barbara/kruger-biography.html|title=Barbara Kruger, American (1945- )|last=|first=|date=2017-03-17|website=Rhode Island Gallery|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kruger crocheted, sewed and painted bright-hued and erotically suggestive objects, some of which were included by curator [[Marcia Tucker]] in the 1973 [[Whitney Biennial]].&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words" /&gt; They were inspired by [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]]'s show at the Museum of Modern Art. Although some of these works were included in the [[Whitney Biennial]], Kruger became detached and unsatisfied with her working output.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1976 she took a break from making what had become more abstract works, feeling that her work had become meaningless and mindless.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She then moved to Berkeley, California where she taught at the [[University of California]] and became inspired by the writings of [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1977 she returned to artmaking, working with her own architectural photographs and publishing an artist's book, ''Picture/Readings'', in 1979.&lt;ref name="christies.com"&gt;[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5496978 Barbara Kruger, ''Untitled (When I hear the word culture I take out my checkbook)'' (1985)] [[Christie's]] Evening Sale of Works from the Peter Norton Collection, 8 November 2011, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; She was inspired to photograph architecture from her family "looking at family homes [they] could never afford."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/barbara-kruger#_|title=Barbara Kruger|last=Bollen|first=Christopher|date=February 28, 2013|website=Interview Magazine|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of her art career, she was intimidated to enter New York galleries due to the art scene which was an atmosphere that, to her, did not welcome "particularly independent, non-masochistic women."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, she received early support for her projects from groups such as the Public Art Fund that encouraged her to continue art making.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She switched to her modern practice of collage in the early 80's.

==Artistic practice==
Addressing issues of language and sign, Kruger has often been grouped with such [[feminist art|feminist postmodern artists]] as [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Sherrie Levine]], [[Martha Rosler]], and [[Cindy Sherman]].&lt;ref name="christies.com"/&gt; Like Holzer and Sherman, in particular, she uses the techniques of mass communication and advertising to explore gender and identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nga.gov.au/exhibitions/readMyLips/index.html Read My Lips: Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger, Cindy Sherman, June 6 - August 9, 1998] [[National Gallery of Australia]].&lt;/ref&gt; Kruger is considered to be part of the [[The Pictures Generation|Pictures Generation]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Eklund, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pcgn/hd_pcgn.htm Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History: The Pictures Generation] Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagery and text===
[[File:Belief+Doubt (2012).jpg|thumb|Belief+Doubt (2012) at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]]
Much of Kruger's work pairs found photographs with pithy and assertive text that challenges the viewer. Her method includes developing her ideas on a computer, later transferring the results (often billboard-sized) into images.&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words"/&gt; Examples of her instantly recognizable slogans read "I shop therefore I am," and "Your body is a battleground," appearing in her trademark white letters against a red background. Much of her text calls attention to ideas such as [[feminism]], [[consumerism]], and individual autonomy and desire, frequently appropriating images from mainstream magazines and using her bold phrases to frame them in a new context.

Kruger has said that "I work with pictures and words because they have the ability to determine who we are and who we aren't."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schirn.de/en/exhibitions/2010/barbara-kruger.html Barbara Kruger: Circus, December 15, 2010 - January 30, 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224141600/http://www.schirn.de/en/exhibitions/2010/barbara-kruger.html |date=December 24, 2010 }} Kunsthalle Schirn, Frankfurt.&lt;/ref&gt; A larger category that threads through her work is the appropriation and alteration of existing images. In describing her use of appropriation, Kruger states: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pictures and words seem to become the rallying points for certain assumptions. There are assumptions of truth and falsity and I guess the narratives of falsity are called fictions. I replicate certain words and watch them stray from or coincide with the notions of fact and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, Barbara &amp; Richard Prince. [http://bombsite.com/issues/3/articles/63 "Interview with Barbara Kruger and Richard Prince"], ''BOMB Magazine'', Spring, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her poster for the 1989 [[List of protest marches on Washington, D.C.|Women's March on Washington]] in support of legal abortion included a woman's face bisected into positive and negative photographic reproductions, accompanied by the text "Your body is a battleground."&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words" /&gt; A year later, Kruger used this slogan in a billboard commissioned by the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]]. Twelve hours later, a group opposed to abortion responded to Kruger's work by replacing the adjacent billboard with an image depicting an eight-week-old fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/barbara-kruger#page5 |title=Barbara Kruger - Page |publisher=Interview Magazine |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kruger's early monochrome pre-digital works, known as 'paste ups', reveal the influence of the artist's experience as a magazine editorial designer during her early career. These small scale works, the largest of which is 11 x 13&amp;nbsp;inches (28 x 33&amp;nbsp;cm), are composed of altered found images, and texts either culled from the media or invented by the artist. A negative of each work was then produced and used to make enlarged versions of these initial 'paste ups'.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Kruger: Paste Up, November 21, 2009 - January 23, 2010, Sprüth Magers Gallery, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1978 and 1979, she completed "Picture/Readings," simple photographs of modest houses alternating with panels of words.&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words" /&gt;  From 1992 on, Kruger designed several magazine covers, such as ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', and ''[[The New Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hagen (June 14, 1992), [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/14/arts/art-barbara-kruger-cover-girl.html Barbara Kruger: Cover Girl] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Her signature font style of [[Futura (typeface)|Futura Bold]] type is likely inspired from the "Big Idea" or "Creative Revolution" advertising style of the 1960s that she was exposed to during her experience at ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle.]]''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1990, Kruger scandalized the Japanese American community of [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles]], with her proposal to paint the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], bordered by provocative questions, on the side of a warehouse in the heart of the historic downtown neighborhood.&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words"/&gt; Kruger had been commissioned by MOCA to paint a mural for "A Forest of Signs: Art in the Crisis of Representation," a 1989 exhibition that also included works by [[Barbara Bloom (artist)|Barbara Bloom]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Jeff Koons]], [[Sherrie Levine]], and [[Richard Prince]]. But before the mural went up, Kruger herself and curator Ann Goldstein presented it at various community meetings over the time period of 18 months.&lt;ref name="MOCA's mural mess"&gt;Christopher Knight (December 14, 2010), [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/12/moca-whitewashes-blu-mural.html MOCA's mural mess] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Only after protests did the artist offer to eliminate the pledge from her mural proposal, while still retaining a series of questions painted in the colors and format of the American flag: "Who is bought and sold? Who is beyond the law? Who is free to choose? Who follows orders? Who salutes longest? Who prays loudest? Who dies first? Who laughs last?".&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words"/&gt; A full year after the exhibition closed, Kruger's reconfigured mural finally went up for a two-year run.&lt;ref name="MOCA's mural mess"/&gt;

In 1994, Kruger's ''L'empathie peut changer le monde'' (''Empathy can change the world'') was installed on a train station platform in [[Strasbourg]], France. One year later, with architects Henry Smith-Miller and Laurie Hawkinson and landscape architect Nicholas Quennell, she designed the 200-foot-long (60 m) sculptural letters ''Picture This'' for a stage and outdoor amphitheater at the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]], Raleigh.&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words"/&gt; Between 1998 and 2008, she created permanent installations for the [[Fisher College of Business]], the Broad Contemporary Art Museum at [[LACMA]], the [[Moderna Museet]], Stockholm, and the [[Price Center]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stuartcollection.ucsd.edu/StuartCollection/Kruger.htm Barbara Kruger: Another, 2008] University of California, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt; For a site-specific piece that she produced at the [[Parrish Art Museum]] in 1998, Kruger placed across the upper range of the museum's Romanesque facade stark red letters that read, "You belong here"; below, on columns separating three arched entry portals, stacked letters spelled "Money" and "Taste."&lt;ref&gt;Ken Johnson (August 6, 2004), [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/arts/art-review-the-hamptons-a-playground-for-creativity.html The Hamptons, A Playground For Creativity] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2005, Kruger installed a digitally printed vinyl mural across the entire facade of the Italian pavilion, thereby dividing it into three parts—green at the left, red at the right, white in between. In English and Italian, the words "money" and "power" climbed the portico's columns; the left wall said, "Pretend things are going as planned," while "God is on my side; he told me so" fills the right.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Knight (June 21, 2005), [http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/21/entertainment/et-venice21 Fueled by politics] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, her installation ''Belief+Doubt'', which covers 6,700 square feet (620 m²) of surface area and was printed onto wallpaper-like sheets in the artist's signature colors of red, black and white, was installed at the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]].&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;Kelly Crow (August 2, 2012), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443866404577564944016522540 An Artist Has Her Say—All Over a Museum's Lobby and Store] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
Since the mid-1990s, Kruger has created large-scale immersive video and audio installations. Enveloping the viewer with the seductions of direct address, the work continues her questioning of power, control, affection and contempt: still images now move and speak and spatialize their commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Kruger: The Globe Shrinks, September, 3 - October 23, 2010, Sprüth Magers Gallery, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Kruger produced a series of fiberglass sculptures of compromised celebrities, including [[John F. Kennedy|John F.]] and [[Robert Kennedy]] hoisting [[Marilyn Monroe]] on their shoulders.&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words"/&gt; For a concurrent show that same year in New York, she had city buses wrapped with quotations from figures such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Courtney Love]], and [[H.L. Mencken]]. For her first retrospective, at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]], she created 15 billboards and countless wild postings, executed and installed in both English and Spanish.&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words"/&gt; For a public awareness campaign to promote arts instruction in the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]], Kruger covered a bus with phrases like "Give your brain as much attention as you do your hair and you'll be a thousand times better off"; "from here to there"; "Don't be a jerk"; and "You want it. You buy it. You forget it."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Blume (October 8, 2012), [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/10/launified-arts-education-campaign-launched.html Campaign launched to promote arts education in L.A. Unified] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Kruger created a work protesting the election of [[Donald Trump]] for the cover of [[New York Magazine]] and participated in a January 20, 2017 inauguration boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=31 October 2016 |title=Trump the Loser, according to Kruger |url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/in-the-frame/trump-the-loser-according-to-kruger/ |newspaper=The Art Newspaper |location= |access-date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trumpprotestart.org/dont-boycott-make-protest-art/ |title=Don't boycott, make protest art! |date=13 January 2017 |website=trumpprotestart.org |publisher= |access-date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching===
Kruger has taught at the Independent Study Program at the [[Whitney Museum]]; [[California Institute of the Arts]], Valencia; [[University of California, Berkeley]]; Chicago; and [[UCSD]] for five years before joining the faculty at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]]. In 1995–96, she was artist in residence at the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]], where she created Public Service Announcements addressing issues of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wexarts.org/about/residencies/ Wexner Center Residency Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525165749/http://www.wexarts.org/about/residencies/ |date=May 25, 2012 }} [[Wexner Center for the Arts]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, she was the Wiegand Foundation Artist in Residence at [[Scripps College]], Claremont.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.scrippscollege.edu/press-releases/barbara-kruger-to-be-wiegand-artist-in-residence-at-scripps Barbara Kruger to be Wiegand Foundation Artist in Residence at Scripps] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701122206/http://media.scrippscollege.edu/press-releases/barbara-kruger-to-be-wiegand-artist-in-residence-at-scripps |date=July 1, 2013 }} [[Scripps College]], Claremont.&lt;/ref&gt; She has written about television, film and culture for ''[[Artforum]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''The New York Times'', and ''[[The Village Voice]]''.

=== Connections with other artists ===
Kruger was involved with a group of artists from her graduating classes from [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]] in the 1970s, including [[Ross Bleckner]] and [[David Salle]], listing them as her "first peer group." She considered [[Diane Arbus]] to be her "first female role model ... [that] didn't wash the floor six times a day." She also was connected with [[Julian Schnabel]], Marilyn Lerner, [[Sherrie Levine]], [[Cindy Sherman]], Jim Welling, [[Nancy Dwyer]], [[Louise Lawler]], [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Laurie Simmons]], Carol Squiers, [[Judith Barry]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Richard Prince]], [[Becky Johnston]], and [[Lynne Tillman]]. She was also involved in a group called Artists Meeting for Cultural Change.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Exhibitions==
&lt;!-- [[File:Shop barbara kruger.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of Barbara Kruger work]] --&gt;
In 1979, Barbara Kruger exhibited her first works combining appropriated photographs and fragments of superimposed text at [[MoMA PS1|P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center]], in Long Island City, Queens. Her first institutional show was staged in London, when [[Iwona Blazwick]] decided to exhibit her work at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;Caroline Roux (May 9, 2011), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/barbara-kruger-slogans-that-shake-society-2281119.html Barbara Kruger: Slogans that shake society] ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Los Angeles mounted the first retrospective exhibition to provide a comprehensive overview of Kruger's career since 1978, which travelled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], New York in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moca.org/library/archive/exhibition/detail/1999/kruger Barbara Kruger, October 17, 1999 - February 13, 2000] Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; Kruger has since been the subject of many one-person exhibitions, including shows organized by the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London (1983); the [[Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal]] (1985); [[Serpentine Gallery]] in London (1994); Palazzo delle Papesse Centro Arte Contemporanea in [[Siena]] (2002); [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]] (2005); and [[Moderna Museet]] in Stockholm (2008). In 2009, Kruger was included in the seminal show "[[The Pictures Generation]], 1974–1984" at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Kruger has also participated in the [[Whitney Biennial]] (1983, 1985, and 1987) and [[Documenta]] 7 and 8 (1982 and 1987). She represented the United States at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1982 and again participated in 2005, when she received the [[Leone d'Oro]] for lifetime achievement.

In 2007, Kruger was one of the many artists to be a part of South Korea's [[Incheon Women Artists' Biennale]] in [[Seoul]]. This marked [[South Korea]]'s first women's [[wikt:biennale|biennial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= South Korea Kicks off First Women's Biennial | publisher=ARTINFO  | date= November 6, 2007| url= http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/26010/south-korea-kicks-off-first-womens-biennial/ | accessdate=2008-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, she designed "Consider This ...", an exhibition at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/consider-this%E2%80%A6 Consider This..., April 9, 2006–January 15, 2007] [[LACMA]]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, Kruger's ''Between Being Born and Dying'', a major installation commissioned by the Lever House Art Collection, opened at the New York City architectural landmark [[Lever House]]. In 2012, as a member of the board of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA)]], Kruger volunteered to be the lead funder of the museum's scholarly exhibit ''Ends of the Earth: Land Art to 1974'' and to create a new work on vinyl to sell with proceeds going entirely toward the show's $1 million budget.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Boehm (March 28, 2012), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-moca-20120328,0,5295919,full.story MOCA bets on festival's star power] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; An exhibition of new and recent work from Barbara Kruger was hosted by [[Modern Art Oxford]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/event/barbara-kruger/&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014.

Kruger's words and pictures have been displayed in both galleries and public spaces, as well as framed and unframed photographs, posters, postcards, T-shirts, electronic signboards, façade banners, and billboards.

==Recognition==
The [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] awarded Kruger the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles#Women in the Arts|MOCA Award to Distinguished Women in the Arts]] in 2001. In 2005, she was included in The Experience of Art at the [[Venice Biennale]] and was the recipient of the [[Leone d'Oro]] for lifetime achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/612 "Barbara Kruger"] Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Retrieved 14 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 10th anniversary Gala in the Garden at the [[Hammer Museum]] in 2012, Kruger was honored by TV presenter [[Rachel Maddow]].&lt;ref&gt;Julie Miller (October 7, 2012), [http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2012/10/steve-martin-tom-hanks-katy-perry-hammer-museum Steve Martin and Rachel Maddow Toast World-Renowned Artists at the Hammer Museum; Katy Perry Toasts Nail Art] ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Kruger joined [[John Baldessari]] and [[Catherine Opie]] in leaving the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]]'s board in protest, but later returned in support of the museum's new director, Philippe Vergne, in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Boehm and Deborah Vankin (March 19, 2014), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-moca-board-news-20140319,0,7583742.story Artists return to MOCA board] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art market==
Kruger's first dealer was [[Gagosian Gallery]], with which she did two shows in Los Angeles in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; In 1986, she was the first woman to join the prominent contemporary art gallery of [[Mary Boone]]&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Spears (August 24, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/arts/design/29kruger.html Resurgent Agitprop in Capital Letters] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; and has had nine solo shows there since. Kruger is also represented by Rhona Hoffman Gallery, Chicago; and [[Sprüth Magers Berlin London]] and L&amp;M Arts in Los Angeles. In late 2011, her 1985 photo of a [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist's dummy]], ''Untitled (When I Hear the Word Culture I Take Out My Checkbook),'' was sold at [[Christie's]] for a record $902,500.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt;

== Supreme lawsuit ==
[[Supreme (clothing)|Supreme]], a skateboard and apparel brand established in 1994, have been accused of taking their logo, the white word "Supreme" on a red box, from Kruger's signature style. [[James Jebbia]], founder of Supreme, has admitted that the logo was taken from Barbara Kruger's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2013/05/supreme-court-the-12-greatest-moments-of-supremes-legal-battle-with-leah-mcsweeney/128|title=Supreme™ Court: The 12 Greatest Moments of Supreme's Legal Battle With Leah McSweeney|last=Deleon|first=Jian|date=May 1, 2013|website=Complex|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara herself had not commented on this issue until a recent lawsuit between Supreme and [[Leah McSweeney]], founder of Married to the Mob (MTTM), a women's street clothing brand. MTTM used the Supreme logo to make a "Supreme Bitch" logo that was printed on T-shirts and hats. In response, Kruger said, "What a ridiculous clusterfuck of totally uncool jokers.

'''Christia V. Daniels Adair''' (October 22, 1893 – December 31, 1989) was an [[African Americans|African-American]] [[suffragist]] and civil rights worker based in Texas. There is a mural in Texas about her life, displayed in a county park which is named for her.

==Early life and education==
Christia V. Daniels was born in 1893 in [[Victoria, Texas]] and grew up in [[Edna, Texas]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=African American Women|last=Salem|first=Dorothy C.|publisher=Garland Publishing|year=1993|isbn=0-8240-9782-3|location=New York and London|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the daughter of Hardy Daniels and Ada Crosby Daniels. Her father had a hauling business, and her mother was a laundress.&lt;ref name="Pruitt"&gt;Bernadette Pruitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-YSzAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;ots=7OA7SlXOmA&amp;dq=Christia%20Adair&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=Christia%20Adair&amp;f=false ''The Other Great Migration: The Movement of Rural African Americans to Houston, 1900-1941''] (Texas A&amp;M University Press 2013): 176. {{ISBN|9781603449489}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had an older, half-sister who had been legally adopted by her mother as well as two younger brothers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/digital_objects/95362|title=Christia Adair.

==Career==
Christia Daniels taught at public schools in Edna for three years and then left teaching in 1918 after she married Elbert H. Adair, a [[brakeman]] for the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad|Missouri-Pacific Railroad]], and moved to [[Kingsville, Texas]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Here, she joined a women's group and fought against gambling establishments and organized petition drives for women's suffrage. Despite the success of the [[Women's suffrage|women's suffrage movement,]] she was prevented from voting in Texas and turned away from a polling place due to state stating that black Americans cannot vote in primaries, even though she was allowed to register to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalyn Terborg-Penn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=U6o0ttZqgtUC&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=Christia%20Adair&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=Christia%20Adair&amp;f=false ''African-American Women in the Struggle for the Vote, 1850-1920''] (Indiana University Press 1998): 147-148. {{ISBN|9780253211767}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This incident prompted Adair to begin working with the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights]] movement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/aalgs/00016/aal-00016.html|title=Christia Adair Collection MSS.0017 An Inventory of her Records at the African American Library at the Gregory School, Houston Public Library|website=legacy.lib.utexas.edu|language=en|others=Adair, Christia V.

Allwright]] case. After the case was decided in the favor of Smith, the Houston chapter of the NAACP became a popular target for bomb threats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She refused to divulge the group's membership rolls to police due to the belief that the Houston police were trying to procure the list in order to break up the chapter, under the guise of claims of [[Barratry (common law)|barratry]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was one of the chapter members who testified during the trial regarding the attempted seizure of the chapter's records.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{lead too short|date=October 2016}}
The '''Constitutional history of Australia''' began with the first white settlement in Sydney in 1788 and has undergone numerous constitutional changes since.

==Settlement==
Prior to European settlement of Australia in 1788, Europeans had been to the land merely as explorers. The only exception was [[James Cook]] who in 1770 sailed up most of the east coast of Australia and then claimed the entire coastline he had just explored as British territory. The basis of the claim is not clear, but it is clear that the indigenous peoples were not consulted and no treaty was entered into. In later years the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' was invoked in justification of the act.

Orders-in-Council were issued in London on 6 December 1785 for the establishment of a colony in Botany Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63477180 |title=Historic Landmarks |newspaper=[[Townsville Daily Bulletin]] |location=Qld. |date=2 October 1952 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Phillip]] was appointed Governor-designate of the new colony in October 1786. In Phillip‘s commission, the boundary was defined as the [[135th meridian east|135th meridian east longitude]] (&lt;abbr title="135th meridian east longitude"&gt;135° east&lt;/abbr&gt;),&lt;ref name="NAA1787"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=35 | title = Governor Phillip's Instructions 25 April 1787 (UK) | work = Documenting a Democracy | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2006-05-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195616/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=35 | archivedate = 15 June 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Territorial evolution of Australia#26 January 1788|26 January 1788 - Map]]) taking the line from [[Melchisédech Thévenot]]'s chart, ''Hollandia Nova‒‒Terre Australe,'' published in ''Relations de Divers Voyages Curieux'' (Paris, 1663).&lt;ref&gt;Sir Joseph Banks, 'Draft of proposed Introduction to Captn Flinders Voyages', November 1811; State Library of New South Wales, The Papers of Sir Joseph Banks, Series 70.16; quoted in Robert J. King, "Terra Australis, New Holland and New South Wales: the Treaty of Tordesillas and Australia", ''The Globe,'' no.47, 1998, pp.35–55, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Lord Sydney appointed him governor, Phillip drew up a detailed memorandum of his plans for the proposed new colony. In one paragraph he wrote: "The laws of this country [England] will of course, be introduced in [New] South Wales, and there is one that I would wish to take place from the moment his Majesty's forces take possession of the country: That there can be no slavery in a free land, and consequently no slaves."&lt;ref name="Phillip"&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical Records of New South Wales |last1=Britton |first1=A |last2=Bladen |first2=F.

The actual settlement was located at [[Sydney Cove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60569425 |title=Australian Discovery and Colonisation |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |location=Sydney |date=14 April 1865 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colony was formally proclaimed by Governor Phillip on 7 February 1788 at Sydney. However, though the settlement was a military prison, and Phillip had full power as governor, the colony also had a civil administration and courts of law.

The first test of the doctrine of ''terra nullius'' occurred in ''R v Tommy''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Tommy'',[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/NSWSupC/1827/70.html &amp;#91;1827&amp;#93; NSWSupC 70] [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court of NSW]] (24&amp;nbsp;November&amp;nbsp;1827).&lt;/ref&gt; which held that the native inhabitants were only subject to English law where the incident concerned both natives and settlers. The rationale was that Aboriginal tribal groups already operated under their own legal systems. This position was further reinforced by the decisions of ''R v Ballard'' &lt;ref&gt;''R v Ballard'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/NSWSupC/1829/26.html &amp;#91;1829&amp;#93; NSWSupC 26] [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court of NSW]] (23&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;1829).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''R v Boatman''.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Boatman'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/NSWSupC/1832/4.html &amp;#91;1832&amp;#93; NSWSupC 4] [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court of NSW]] (23&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;1832).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1835, [[Richard Bourke|Governor Bourke]] issued a proclamation which showed the implication of the doctrine of ''terra nullius''.{{r|1835Proclamation}} He proclaimed that [[Indigenous Australians]] could not sell or assign land, nor could an individual person or group acquire land, other than through distribution by the [[Crown land|Crown]].
{{refn|group=n|name=quote|This document{{r|1835Proclamation}} implemented the doctrine of ''terra nullius'' upon which British settlement was based, reinforcing the notion that the land belonged to no one prior the British Crown taking possession of it. Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown... Although many people at the time also recognised that the Aboriginal occupants had rights in the lands (and this was confirmed in a House of Commons report on Aboriginal relations in 1837), the law followed and almost always applied the principles expressed in Bourke's proclamation. This would not change until the Australian High Court's decision in {{cite AustLII |litigants=[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]|year=1992 |court=HCA |num=23 |parallelcite=(1992) 175 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1}}.}} The proclamation was approved by the [[Colonial Office]] on 10 October 1835. The proclamation was issued in response to the attempt by graziers from Van Diemen's Land to enter into an agreement with indigenous tribes in Port Philip, known as [[Batman's Treaty]].{{r|1835Proclamation}}

During the 19th century, separate British colonies were formed in Australia. In 1825, [[Tasmania]], named Van Diemen's Land, was proclaimed a separate colony from the colony of New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-73.html |title=New South Wales Act 1823 (UK) |via=[[Old Parliament House, Canberra#Museum of Australian Democracy|Museum of Australian Democracy]] |website=foundingdocs.gov.au |date= |access-date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-30.html |title=Order-in-Council separating Van Diemen's Land from New South Wales 14 June 1825 (UK) |via=[[Old Parliament House, Canberra#Museum of Australian Democracy|Museum of Australian Democracy]] |website=www.foundingdocs.gov.au |date= |access-date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swan River Colony]] of Western Australia was established in 1832, separately from that of New South Wales, effectively taking over by Britain of the remainder of the Australian continent.

==Responsible government==
{{main article|Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865}}
Between 1855 and 1890, the six colonies individually gained [[responsible government]], managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="Davisonp556"&gt;{{Harvnb|Davison, Hirst and Macintyre||p=556}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs,&lt;ref name="Davisonp138"&gt;{{Harvnb|Davison, Hirst and Macintyre||pp=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; defence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Colonial Defence and Imperial Repudiation|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=DSC18601113.2.12&amp;l=mi&amp;e=-------10--1----0-all|date=13 November 1860|issue=vol XVII, issue 1349|newspaper=Daily Southern Cross|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and international shipping. New Zealand achieved responsible government in 1853, New South Wales and Victoria in 1855, Tasmania in 1856, Queensland in 1859 ([[Separation of Queensland|separated from New South Wales]] in that year with self-government from the beginning) and Western Australia in 1890. These arrangements were confirmed by the ''[[Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865]]''.

The ''Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865'' was a British Act of Parliament to define the relationship between local ("colonial") and British ("imperial") legislation. It confirmed that colonial legislation was to have full effect within the colony, limited only to the extent that it was not in contradiction with ("repugnant to") any Imperial Act which extended to that colony. The Act had the effect of clarifying and strengthening the position of colonial legislatures, while at the same time restating their ultimate subordination to the British Parliament.

Until the passage of the Act, a number of colonial statutes had been struck down by local judges on the grounds of repugnancy to [[English law]]s (whether or not those English laws had been intended by Parliament to be effective in the colony). This had been a particular problem for the [[Government of South Australia|government]] in South Australia, where [[Benjamin Boothby|Justice Benjamin Boothby]] had struck down local statutes on numerous occasions in the colony's [[Supreme Court of South Australia|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;see for example ''Dawes v Quarrel '' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SAPelhamRp/1865/1.html (1865) Pelham's Reports 1] at p. 8 [[Supreme Court of South Australia|Supreme Court of SA]] (18&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;1865).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UTasLawRw/1965/3.html |author=Campbell, Enid |authorlink=Enid Campbell |title=Colonial Legislation and the Laws of England |publisher= (1965) 2(2) [[UTAS Faculty of Law|University of Tasmania Law Review]] 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLawJl/2013/13.html |author=Clark, David |title=The Struggle for Judicial Independence: The Amotion and Suspension of Supreme Court Judges in Nineteenth Century Australia |publisher=(2013) 12 [[Macquarie Law Journal]] 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Towards federation==
The first formal steps to federation of the colonies was in the form of the [[Federal Council of Australasia]] in 1885. However, the Council was a weak non-executive, non-legislative federation of Western Australia, Fiji, Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria. The movement for full federation developed in the late 19th century, culminating in the six Australian colonies forming a federation of States. It was envisaged that New Zealand might also join.

In the 1890s, two [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|constitutional conventions]] were called, which ultimately adopted a constitution based on a combination of British, American and other models (monarchy and parliamentary government from Britain, federalism from Canada and the United States, the use of the referendum from Switzerland). This constitution was then approved by the voters in each of the six colonies. (At the time women had the vote in only one of them: South Australia, and Aboriginal Australians in South Australia and Queensland only).

It was then passed (with an amendment allowing for some appeals to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] in London) as an Act of the British Parliament: the [[Constitution of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act]] 1900. The Act entered into force on 1 January 1901, at which point the Commonwealth of Australia came into being.

The Australian Constitution, besides other matters, dealt with the allocation of powers between the colonies, which became states, and the federal parliament. Most of the powers, including those of foreign affairs and defence, were concurrent powers, with the proviso that if there was a conflict between the federal and a state law, then the federal law "will prevail". But the United Kingdom still had the power to engage in foreign affairs on behalf of Australia, and to make laws for it. In the early years Australia continued to be represented by the United Kingdom as part of the British Empire at international conferences. In 1919, following Canadian lead, Australian Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] insisted that Australia have separate representatives at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Versailles Peace Conference]] and not as part of the British delegation.

The Constitution provided that the British monarch be represented in Australia by a Governor-General. Originally, appointments were made on the advice of the British, not the Australian, government, and was generally a British aristocrat. In 1930, the Australian government insisted that Australian-born [[Isaac Isaacs]] being appointed. The British government very reluctantly accepted the Australian position that such appointments be made on the advice of the Australian government.

Finally, the Constitution provided that any law of the Australian Parliament could be disallowed within a year by the British monarch (acting on the advice of British ministers), though this power was never in fact exercised. In summary, the constitutional position of the Commonwealth as a whole in relation to the United Kingdom was, originally, the same as that of the individual colonies before federation.

==From a united imperial Crown to a shared monarch==
A fundamental change in the constitutional structures of the British Commonwealth (formerly the British Empire, and not to be confused with the Commonwealth of Australia) did occur, however, in the late 1920s. Under the British [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]], which implemented a decision of an earlier Commonwealth conference, the unified Crown that had heretofore been the centre point of the Empire was replaced by multiple crowns worn by a ''shared monarch''.

Before 1927, King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] reigned as king ''in'' Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the [[Irish Free State]], [[South Africa]], etc., each of these states, in effect, as dominions, amounting to a subset of the United Kingdom. After 1927, he reigned as King ''of'' Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, South Africa, etc.

The form of use in the royal title as issued by King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=François Velde |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/britstyles.htm#1927 |title=Royal Arms, Styles, and Titles of Great Britain |publisher=Heraldica.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not mention the dominions by name, except 'Ireland', which changed from being referred to as ''Great Britain and Ireland'' to ''Great Britain, Ireland'', indicating that it was no longer part of the United Kingdom, but a separate state of which the monarch was now directly the head, rather than through linkage with Great Britain. Though unnamed, except through reference to the 'British Dominions beyond the Seas', the ground-breaking move shattered the previous concept of the shared monarch to one of multiple monarchies, all held by the one monarch.

Though this principle was implicit in the Act and in the King's new titles, and came out of a Commonwealth Conference, neither the British government nor the dominion governments seemed initially to grasp its significance. So while the Irish ''immediately'' put the principle into effect by assuming the right to select their own governor-general and to demand a direct right of audience with the King (excluding British ministers), other dominions were much slower to go down this path, and when they did so, they were faced with determined, though ultimately futile, attempts to block such evolution in London.

Whereas before 1927, it was correct in law to talk about the ''British monarch'' reigning in the dominions, after 1927, there was technically a [[Monarchy of Australia|King of Australia]], etc., even if that title was never used formally, with the only link being that that monarch was also monarch of the UK and resident outside the Commonwealth of Australia. Curiously, while the Irish asserted the title ''[[King of Ireland]]'' by having King George V sign an international treaty on behalf of his Irish realm as early as 1931 (where he was formally advised by the Irish Minister for External Affairs who formally attended His Majesty, with no British minister present), the formal title ''Queen of Australia'' was only adopted through the ''Royal Style and Titles Act'' 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A00044 |title=Royal Style and Titles Act 1973 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statute of Westminster 1931==
By the mid-1920s, it was accepted by the [[British government]] that [[British Dominions|dominions]] would have full legislative autonomy. This was given legislative effect in 1931 by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. The Statute took effect in Australia in 1942 with the passing of the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942]], with retroactive effect to 3 September 1939, the start of World War II. The adoption of the Statute repealed the application of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 in relation to federal legislation. However, the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 continued to have application in individual [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states]] until the [[Australia Act 1986]] came into effect in 1986.

==Crisis in 1975==
{{main article|1975 Australian constitutional crisis}}
The elections of the [[Australian Labor Party]] in 1972 and 1974 under its leader [[Gough Whitlam]] forced several constitutional issues to be tested. For two weeks in 1972, the Government had only two ministers, Whitlam and [[Lance Barnard]]. Although it had a majority in the lower House, the ALP faced a hostile Senate, and the defeat of Government bills led to a double dissolution and a consequent [[Joint Sitting, Australian parliament, 1974|joint sitting]] and the passing of the bills into law as allowed under section 57. The political situation however was not improved much by the 1974 election, and the Senate later failed to provide "supply" (i.e. to pass tax and expenditure acts). The resulting [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975]] raised a series of issues: 
* Must a State Governor appoint a party's nomination as a replacement in the Senate?
* Should the Senate refuse supply or refuse to discuss supply?
* Should the Prime Minister resign in such a situation?
* If he does not, should the Governor-General dismiss him?
* How can the Governor-General and Prime Minister have a sensible discussion when each is able to have the other dismissed immediately provided that the other has not already acted?

Of these, only the first has been partly resolved; an amendment in 1977 changed the procedure for casual appointment. While the State Parliaments can still require a state Governor to appoint somebody who is not the party's nominee, by stripping that nominee of their party membership the party can deny them appointment to the Senate. Under Section 11 of the Constitution a State parliament can still refuse to appoint the party's nominee; in this case, a stand-off can develop where the vacancy goes unfilled.  This occurred in 1987, when the Tasmanian state parliament refused to appoint the Labor Party's nominee for a casual vacancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/odgers13?file=chapter04&amp;section=25 |title=Odgers' Senate Practice |edition=13th |chapter=Delay in filling casual vacancies |year=2012 |ISBN=9781742296203 |pages=134–5 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two time-honoured constitutional principles were in conflict during the crisis. The first is that a ministry drawn from the majority of the lower house may continue to govern until it has lost the confidence of the House. The second is that a ministry may not continue to govern once supply has been exhausted. The potential of conflict has been resolved in the United Kingdom, where the [[House of Lords]] no longer has the power to block money bills. To date it has not been resolved in Australia. The crisis of 1975 may be repeated in the future, though it is unlikely.

==The Australia Act==
The power under the Statute of Westminster to request the British Parliament to make laws for Australia was used on several occasions, primarily to enable Australia to acquire new territories. But its most significant use was also its last. This was when the procedure was used to pass the [[Australia Act 1986]]. The Australia Act effectively terminated the ability of the British Parliament or Government to make laws for Australia or its States, even at their request; and provided that any law which was previously required to be passed by the British Parliament on behalf of Australia could now be passed by Australia and its States by themselves.

Since the Australia Act, the only remaining constitutional link with the United Kingdom (if it is one) is in the person of the monarch (see [[Queen of Australia]]). But even that connection may not be automatic. In an important constitutional case ([[Sue v Hill|''Sue v Hill'' (1999) 163 ALR 648]]), three justices of the [[High Court of Australia]] (the ultimate court of appeal) expressed the view that if the British Parliament were to alter the law of succession to the throne, such a change could ''not'' have any effect on the monarchy in Australia, because of the Australia Act: succession to the throne would continue in Australia according to the existing rule, unless and until that was altered ''in Australia''. None of the other four justices in that case disagreed with this reasoning. (Because it was not strictly necessary to decide the case at hand, this is not strictly a binding judicial determination; but it is almost certainly correct given the [[precedent]] of the [[Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII|Abdication Crisis of 1936]].)

The same case decided (and on this point the decision ''is'' binding) that the United Kingdom is a "foreign power" within the meaning of the Constitution, and therefore that holders of British citizenship are ineligible for election to the Federal Parliament (though a special "grandfathering" arrangement merely phases out the right of British citizens to vote).

==Towards an Australian republic?==
{{main article|Australian republicanism}}
As already seen, the only remaining constitutional connection with the United Kingdom is through the monarch, who is the monarch not only of the UK, but also of Australia and of each of its States. The main function of the monarch is to appoint and dismiss the Governor-General and the State Governors, and this function is exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or the relevant State Premier. (The monarch is also sometimes asked to perform some function, such as giving the Royal Assent to an Act of Parliament, for ceremonial purposes during a Royal visit.)

'''Counter-hegemonic globalization''' is a [[social movement]] based in a perspective of [[globalization]] that challenges the contemporary view of globalization; [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] globalization. [[Counterhegemony|Counter-hegemonic]] globalization confronts the implicit idea of neoliberal globalization that the system of domination, as a consequence of the development of transnational networks, transportation and communication, is a natural and inevitable course for globalization. It maintains that transnational connections can instead be harnessed as the means to bring about more equitable distribution of wealth, power, and sustainable communities. Counter-hegemonic globalization, unlike neoliberal globalization, uses the assets of globalization to stand against any form of domination by [[hegemony]], operating from a bottom-up process that stresses the empowerment of the local.

[[Peter B. Evans|Peter Evans]], a political sociologist renowned for his contributions to the development of this theory, defined counter-hegemonic globalization as “a globally organized effort to replace the neoliberal global regime with one that maximizes democratic political control and makes the equitable development of human capabilities and environment stewardship its priorities.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Evans |first=Peter |date=June 2008 |title=Is an alternative globalization possible? |journal=[[Politics &amp; Society]] |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=271–305 |doi=10.1177/0032329208316570 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In defense to the arbitrary exploitation by neo-liberal globalization, the number of advocates of counter-hegemonic globalization seems to have increased. There are already sets of transnational networks and ideological frames imposed by many activists pursuing the perspectives of counter-hegemonic globalization; collectively called the “[[global justice movement]]". The number of transnational [[Non-governmental organization|Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)]] supporting counter-hegemonic globalization has doubled between 1973 and 1983 and doubled again between 1983 and 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2005|p=665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, with the cultural and ideological diffusion of counter-hegemonic globalization proven significant in the recent [[Occupy Wall Street|Wall Street Protest]], the movement is beginning to be regarded as an effective and promising political antidote to the current domination-oriented globalization by many activists and theorists.

While Peter Evans and [[Boaventura de Sousa Santos]] remain two prominent theorists who have contributed to the counter-hegemonic globalization theory, classic Marxist socialist ideas are implicated in the theory. For example, [[Antonio Gramsci]] asserted that any struggle over globalization must be conducted at the level of the [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] (culture, institutions, political power structures, roles, rituals, and state), the revolutionary bloc is no longer determined solely by objective and economic factors of class but through subjective factors related to shared perceptions that cut across class lines to include all those individuals and social groups experiencing difficulty in the [[economic globalization]].

== History ==
The project of counter-hegemonic globalization emerged mainly as a result of neoliberal policies and [[Structural Adjustment Programs]] in Latin America in the 1980s. The fundamental base for counter-hegemonic globalization movement has been the long history of labor unions struggle for better work environments and equitable distribution of welfare against the dominating authority. Currently, local and transnational trade unions play majors parts in the counter-hegemonic globalization movement.

For example, the South-based [[World social forum|World Social Forum (WSF)]] was organized as a joint venture between [[Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and for Citizens' Action|ATTAC]] and the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Brazilian Workers Party]] to counter the [[World Economic Forum]]. It first began with the mission of rescuing classic social democratic agendas of social protection in danger of disappearing under neoliberal globalization and is now the representative organization that supports counter-hegemonic globalization.

== A global social movement ==
Originating from the worker's movement, the counter-hegemonic globalization movement has expanded to various different fields of [[social movement]]s. Three primary pillars constitute counter-hegemonic globalization: the [[labor movement|labor]], [[women's movement|women's]], and [[environmental movement]]s, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of each of these three global social movements depends on being able to complement each other and generate broad alliances among them.

===Labor movement===
Under the influence of neo-liberal globalization, labor was systematically reconstructed into a spot market rather than a social contract between employer and employee. Employment was outsourced and informalized throughout different countries and labor was bought and sold with minimum expectations regarding employment contract. Such security-threatening phenomenon triggered powerful global labor solidarity; various NGOs and activists unified to fight for labor security against abrupt and powerful hegemonies sweeping across the globe.

==== Teamsters UPS strike ====
The 1997 UPS strike by the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] (IBT) is recognized as one of the most triumphant moments in the history of counter-hegemonic globalization movements; for it has perfectly demonstrated the nature of counter-hegemonic globalization. The Teamsters Union went on strike against the UPS because UPS was "seen as representing the intrusion of the "American Model" of aggressive anti-union behavior, coupled with the expansion of part-time and temporary jobs with low pay and benefits and the use of subcontracting".

The first victory was in how IBT took advantage of a previously underexploited global organization — [[International Transport Workers' Federation|The International Transport Workers Federation]] (ITF). Through ITF, a World Council of UPS union was created. It started a "World Action Day" which mounted 150 jobs actions and demonstrators around the world. This action taken by ITF helped the workers win the strike, and also showed how international organizations, a product of hegemonic globalization, could be successfully used as a tool to fight against hegemonic globalization. The second victory came when numbers of European unions took action in support of US strikers.

===Women's movement===
Due to this new form of globalization, the transnational women's movement has been brought to the forefront of transnational social movement. Until the emergence of such revolutionary transformation of gender roles came into places, the disadvantages of inequitably allocation of resources derived from neo-liberal globalism fell heavily on women. According to Peter Evans, the "structural adjustment" and many of neo-liberal strategies for global governance of feminism is embedded in gender bias. Consequently, transnational women's movements now account for many of the leading roles in counter-hegemonic movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2005|p=667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the women's movement has been quite like the labor movement, in working with the issue of human rights, it also has more difficulty with the "contradictions of building politics around the universalistic language of rights." Evans points out that feminists have the advantage of universal recognition of "women's rights are human rights," and have been benefiting from globalization in helping and empowering oppressed women across the world. However, he also suggests that feminist movements are still confronted with the challenge of "one size fits all" [[Global feminism|global feminist]] agendas implemented by neo-liberal globalization. For example, the critics of the 1995 Beijing World Conference on Women argue that international organizations were "perpetuating colonialist power relations under the guise of transnational unity."

However, despite many of the challenges, feminists movement started to recognize the significance of more complex and efficient global agenda with the tide of counter-hegemonic movements. The adoption of CEDAW ([[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]) by the UN is considered equivalent of the victory in the Kyoto Accord on global warming. In addition, the development of a new organization in places such as India, South Africa, Turkey, and other countries in Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, called the [[Self-Employed Women's Association]] (SEWA) has become an intricate part of many cultures and governments.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://masksinmexico.blogspot.kr/2009/02/counterhegemonic-globalization.html |last=Modahl |first=Sara |date=2 February 2009 |website=Masks in Mexico |title=Counterhegemonic globalization |access-date=April 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=April 2017}} Due to the fact that this organization incorporates informal sector employment, consisting of the least privileged women of the global South, SEWA is considered the leading transnational organization to adopt "feminism without borders" agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2005|p=668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental movement===
Global [[Environmental movement|environment movements]] are usually considered the most successful of counter-hegemonic social movements.From environment movement's success, we see many advantageous correlations with the other two movements: labor movements and women's movements. Firstly, Just like the other two movements, political clout for environmental movements depend on the diffusion of universal ideology such as "saving the planet" as of "human rights" and "democracy" for women's movement and labor movement respectively. Secondly, the possibility of using governance structures empowered by hegemonic globalization also applies to the case of environment movement. UN system had been proved extremely valuable and effective in supporting and empowering transnational environmental movement. UN helps to organize international conferences, and to solidify transnational networks.From environment movement, we see counter-hegemonic movements, once again, leveraging the ideas and organizational structures implemented by hegemonic globalization.

However, the obstacles for environment movement still remains. The formidable gap separating the South's "environmentalism of the poor" and the "conservationist" of traditional Northern environmental groups still restrict many possible transnational environmental activities. In addition, building a global organization that can effectively integrate international interest of environment rather than focusing on nations' self-interest still remain as a challenge as well.

==== Narmada Valley Project  ====
The Narmada Valley Project includes the [[Sardar Sarovar Dam]], one of the most controversial projects in India. The communities of India protested against destroying prime agricultural land, large tracts of forests, rich horticulture, and hilly as well as densely populated habitats through lop-sided development, displacement and disparity growing with the presently imposed growth-centric paradigm of development for dominating corporate.

The '''Country Party''' of [[New Zealand]] was a political party which appealed to rural voters. It was represented in [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]] from 1928 to 1938. Its policies were a mixture of rural advocacy and [[social credit]] theory.

==History==
The Country Party had its origins in the Auckland Farmers' Union, a branch of the New Zealand Farmers' Union which covered most of the upper [[North Island]]. In the 1920s, members of this branch increasingly came to believe that the [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]], which traditionally enjoyed much support in rural areas, was now putting the interests of farmers behind those of businesses in the city. The Auckland branch was also strongly influenced by the social credit theory of [[monetary reform]], promoted by [[C. H. Douglas]].  Many farmers believed that the country's financial system did not treat them fairly, and that they were being exploited by big-city bankers and moneylenders.

The Auckland branch grew increasingly frustrated with the Farmers' Union leadership, which did not support having an independent rural party. Eventually members of the Auckland branch established the Country Party without the Union's backing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NZTR19241011.2.12&amp;l=mi&amp;e=-------10--1----0-all |title=Farmer Party Evangelist Ross Leads Secession |publisher=NZ Truth |date=11 October 1924 |accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, the branch broke away from the Union altogether, giving its full backing to the Country Party. Because of this geographical basis, the Country Party was largely confined to the upper North Island.

In the [[New Zealand general election, 1925|1925 elections]], the Country Party fielded five candidates, but only won 0.3% of the vote. In the [[New Zealand general election, 1928|1928 elections]], however, the party won 1.6% of the vote, and [[Harold Rushworth]], its candidate in the [[Bay of Islands (New Zealand electorate)|Bay of Islands]] seat, was narrowly elected. In Parliament, the Country Party tended to align itself with the growing [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], primarily because both parties were distrustful of the financial and banking industries.

In the [[New Zealand general election, 1931|1931 elections]], the Country Party increased its share of the vote to 2.3%, and Rushworth kept his seat. In the [[New Zealand general election, 1935|1935 elections]], the party's share of the vote dropped slightly, but it won two seats – Rushworth, aided by the Labour Party's decision not to stand a candidate against him, was re-elected, while [[Arthur Sexton]] was elected in the [[Franklin (New Zealand electorate)|Franklin]] electorate.

In the [[New Zealand general election, 1938|1938 elections]], the Country Party lost both its seats as Labour decided to contest them. Rushworth had retired (partly because of Labour's intervention) and Sexton was defeated by the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]. The party won only 0.23% of the vote, and disappeared soon afterwards. Most rural voters who had supported it turned to the National Party, which incorporated the Reform Party. Later, however, the [[Social Credit Party (New Zealand)|Social Credit Party]] would gain a certain amount of success in rural areas using much the same formula – some see the Country Party as a forerunner to the more long-lived Social Credit.{{sfn|Gully|1966|p=}}

== Country Party, 1969 == 
The Country Party was revived for the {{NZ election link|1969}} by Clifford Stanley Emeny of New Plymouth (1920–2000), a World War II air force veteran. The party put forward candidates in 15 seats, and they attracted 6,715 votes. Emeny stood in Stratford where he got 1130 votes, the largest vote for the party; and in Egmont, New Plymouth, Tauranga and Waimarino. The other seats contested were Ashburton, Hamilton West, Otago, Pahiatua, Raglan, Rangitikei, Rodney, Waikato, Waitomo and Wallace.

The Country Party had changed its name to the Liberal Reform Party in 1970. In the {{NZ election link|1972}}, Emeny stood as a Liberal Reform candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Norton |first= Clifford |title= New Zealand Parliamentary Election Results 1946–1987: Occasional Publications No 1, Department of Political Science |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 1988 |publisher=  Victoria University of Wellington |location=  Wellington |isbn= 0-475-11200-8 |oclc= |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Democracy Without Borders, or DWB''' is a [[nongovernmental organization]] based in Berlin and founded in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/#about|title=Democracy Without Borders: About|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that advocates the "democratization and strengthening of the United Nations and other international organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/#about|title=Democracy Without Borders: About|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization supports "global democracy and a holistic approach to democracy promotion that spans from the local to the global levels and at the same time embraces the dimensions of representation, participation, deliberation and co-decision." Prior to March 2017 the organization's name was the Committee for a Democratic UN, or KDUN (for its German name "Komitee für eine demokratische UNO").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/4027/the-committee-for-a-democratic-u-n-is-now-democracy-without-borders/ The Committee for a Democratic U.N. is now Democracy Without Borders]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
DWB's mandate states that the organisation "strives for a democratic world order in which citizens participate beyond national boundaries in shaping policy that serves their joint long-term interests." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/mandate/|title=Democracy Without Borders|work=Democracy Without Borders|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, it advocates the creation of a [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] (UNPA), through "democratization and reform of the United Nations and intergovernmental bodies in order to enable them to deal with transnational issues and threats successfully and on a legitimate basis." It seeks to achieve this through a gradual approach, starting first with forming the UNPA as a largely consultative body, before slowly empowering it as public support rises&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/#about|title=Website of Democracy Without Borders|website=Democracy Without Borders|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

DWB also maintains a blog, which publishes a range of articles relating to global governance and the proliferation of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/blog/|title=DWB Blog|last=|first=|date=|website=Democracy Without Borders|access-date=27/02/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DWB is co-founder and coordinator of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly|Campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.unpacampaign.org/about/|title=About the campaign|last=Assembly|first=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the latter has since gained support from over 1500 members of parliament from around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/|title=Supporters|last=Assembly|first=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In February 2018, a Swedish Democracy Without Borders association was formed, which focuses upon the promotion of the UNPA within Sweden. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/4669/swedish-association-of-democracy-without-borders-established-in-stockholm/|title=Swedish association of Democracy Without Borders established in Stockholm|last=|first=|date=|website=Democracy Without Borders|access-date=28/02/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is associated member of the [[World Federalist Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wfm-igp.org/members/wfm-organizations-map|title=Our Members Around The World {{!}} WFM-IGP|website=www.wfm-igp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dynamic defence''', is a key concept in [[Rhizome Manoeuvre]], and [[Three-Dimensional (3D) Tactics Analysis]], and is a key concept in contemporary [[Terrorist Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures]].

An “erratic assault/dynamic defence” is where one or both sides deliberately act without any plan as a means to create a chaotic situation during the battle, thereby overwhelming opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, C. (2009) 2D Verses 3D Tactical Supremacy in Urban Operations. Journal of Information Warfare. (8)2: 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the key concepts underpinning dynamic defence, are "deliberate erratic actions" and "attack zones"- the surfaces or spaces vulnerable to attack.

== Deliberate erratic actions ==
In military tactics, the deliberate use of "erratic action",&lt;ref&gt;Ranan D. Kuperman. (2007) Cycles of Violence: The Evolution of the Israeli Decision Regime Governing the Use of Limited Military Force. Lexington Books: 41.&lt;/ref&gt; forces an opponent, subjected to hit-and-run attacks without warning, to remain on constant alert; and which deliberately wears them down. Examples of erratic tactics used in [[terrorism]] are where attacks are opportunistic, and targets selected have only a generic relationships with the supposed political aims of the terrorists involved. The value of the attack, rests in the confusion, and ultimate shock value of the attack when it finally happens.

These tactics deliberately present ambiguity, and are largely impossible to predict. The advantage of an 'erratic attacks', is that these constitute an omnipresent and/or invisible threat, and as these occur seemingly randomly; such as for example - a wide range of potential targets are possible, however one will be chosen randomly, and immediately attacked. The purpose of which is to avoid encountering any form of prepared defence.

== Attack zones ==
An attack zone is an adaptation of the concept of an [[attack surface]], which in the world of computer security, means ‘the depth of methods a hacker can use to exploit a system’.&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, C. (2014) 3D Vulnerability Analysis Solution to the Problem of Military Energy Security and Interposing Tactics. Journal of Information Warfare. URL: http://www.jinfowar.com/3d-vulnerability-analysis-solution-problem-military-energy-security-interposing-tactics/&lt;/ref&gt; The concept, also has an historical military strategy parallel, in the 1921 Turkish defence at the [[Sakarya River]], was based on [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]’s instructions: “you will no longer have a line of defence, but a surface of defence.... All of Turkey shall be our surface of defence, upon which our units will resist everywhere and all the time”.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, P. (2001), Atatürk: The Rebirth of a Nation. Phoenix, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentally, an 'attack zone', is represented by a surface, or space, and is the set of ways in which an adversary can attack a system and potentially cause damage. There are two types of attack:	
* Avenue of attack: This focuses on a particular objective that is perceived to be tactically/strategically important. This type of attack is typically controlled by ‘force moderation’, and a deliberate process of targeting and selection.
* Zone attack: No real targets are identified, except that the attack zone contains a number of potential targets.
This situation places an attacker, at a tactical advantage, as the defenders tend to think in terms of deliberate process of targeting and selection. The attackers think in terms of no specific targets. Thus, adding to deception and confusion among the defenders. In particular, making [[interdiction]] for a defender difficult to implement; as attackers have an immediate advantage deploying in a target rich environment, behaving erratically to achieve surprise and deception, through a series of [[Rhizome Manoeuvre|rhizome manoeuvres]].

== Dynamic or randomized defence ==
In order to out-compete the erratic moving attacker, the defender has two options:
* Adopt a denial strategy (akin to concept of [[sea denial]]): The defender creates areas under surveillance or fire that become no-go-zones for a would-be attacker.
* Harness happenstance and coincidence: The defender begins to move themselves throughout the zone – meandering around, in order to create a situation where the attacker cannot be sure where the defender will be next and both combatants run the risk of coming across the other without warning. In which case, both forces, depend on having a higher state of [[situational awareness]] and high-end military capacity to out-perform them when encountered.

{{History of Mexico}}
Mexico's economic history has been characterized since the colonial era by resource extraction, agriculture, and a relatively underdeveloped industrial sector. Economic elites in the colonial period were predominantly Spanish born, active as transatlantic merchants and silver mine owners and diversifying their investments with the landed estates. The largest sector of the population was indigenous subsistence farmers, who lived mainly in the center and south.

[[New Spain]] was envisioned by the Spanish crown as a supplier of wealth to Iberia, which huge silver mines accomplished. A colonial economy to supply foodstuffs and products from ranching as well as a domestic textile industry meant that the economy supplied much of its own needs. Crown economic policy rattled American-born elites’ loyalty to Spain when in 1804 it instituted a policy to make mortgage holders pay immediately the principal on their loans, threatening the economic position of cash-strapped land owners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asunción Lavrin]], "The Execution of the Law of Consolidation in New Spain." ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 52 (Feb. 1973), 27-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Independence in Mexico in 1821 was economically difficult for the country, with the loss of its supply of mercury from Spain in silver mines.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Coatsworth, "Obstacles of Economic Growth in Nineteenth-Century Mexico", ''American Historical Review'', vol. 83, no. 1 (Feb. 1978) p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the patterns of wealth in the colonial era continued into the first half of the nineteenth century, with agriculture being the main economic activity with the labor of indigenous and mixed-race peasants. The mid-nineteenth-century Liberal [[Reforma]] (ca. 1850–1861; 1867–76) attempted to decrease the economic power of the Roman Catholic Church and to modernize and industrialize the Mexican economy. Following civil war and a foreign intervention, the late nineteenth century found political stability and economic prosperity during the presidential regime of General [[Porfirio Díaz]] (1876–1911). Mexico was opened to foreign investment and, to a lesser extent, foreign workers. Foreign capital built a railway network, one of the keys for transforming the Mexican economy, by linking regions of Mexico and major cities and ports. As the construction of the railway bridge over a deep canyon at Metlac demonstrates, Mexico's topography was a barrier to economic development. The mining industry revived in the north of Mexico and the petroleum industry developed in the north Gulf Coast states with foreign capital.

Regional civil wars broke out in 1910 and lasted until 1920, known generally as the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Following the military phase of the Revolution, Mexican regimes attempted to "transform a largely rural and backward country … into a middle-sized industrial power."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel S. Woinczek. "Industrialization, Foreign Capital, and Technology Transfer: The Mexican Experience, 1930–1985." ''Development and Change'' (SAGE. London, Beverly Hills, and New Delhi). Vol 17 (1986), 283–302.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican [[Constitution of 1917]] gave the Mexican government the power to expropriate property, which allowed for the distribution of land to peasants, but also the [[Mexican oil expropriation]] in 1938. Mexico benefited economically from its participation in World War II and the post-war years experienced what has been called the [[Mexican Miracle]] (ca. 1946–1970). This growth was fueled by [[import substitution industrialization]]. The Mexican economy experienced the limits of ISI and economic nationalism and Mexico sought a new model for economic growth. Huge oil reserves were discovered in the Gulf of Mexico in the late 1970s and Mexico borrowed heavily from foreign banks with loans denominated in U.S. dollars. When the price of oil dropped in the 1980s, Mexico experienced a severe financial crisis.

Under President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] Mexico campaigned to join the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] with the expanded treaty going into effect in Mexico, the U.S., and Canada on January 1, 1994. Mexico implemented [[neoliberal]] economic policies and changed significant articles of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 to ensure private property rights against future nationalization. In the twenty-first century, Mexico has strengthened its trade ties with China, but Chinese investment projects in Mexico have hit roadblocks in 2014–15. Mexico's continued dependence on oil revenues has had a deleterious impact when oil prices drop, as is happening 2014–15.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Wilkinson, "Mexico, buffeted by low oil prices, cuts spending", ''Los Angeles Times'', January 31, 2015, p. A7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy of New Spain, 1521–1821 ==

Mexico's economy in the colonial period was based on resource extraction (mainly [[silver]]), on agriculture and ranching, and on trade, with manufacturing playing a minor role. In the immediate post-conquest period (1521–40), the dense indigenous and hierarchically organized central Mexican peoples were a potential ready labor supply and producers of [[tribute]] goods. Indian communities' tribute and labor (but not land) were granted to individual conquerors in an arrangement called [[encomienda]]. Conquerors built private fortunes less from the plunder of the brief period of conquest than from the labor and tribute and the acquisition of land in areas where they held encomiendas, translating that into long-term sustainable wealth.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "Encomienda and Hacienda: The Evolution of the Great Estate in the Indies," ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 49:3(1969) 411–29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', Pearson 2003, 163–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonial landscape in central Mexico became a patchwork of different sized holdings by Spaniards and indigenous communities. As the crown began limiting the encomienda in the mid-sixteenth century to prevent the development of an independent seigneurial class, Spaniards who had become land owners acquired permanent and part-time labor from Indian and mixed-race workers. Although the encomienda was a major economic institution of the early period, in the end it was a transitory phase, due to the drop in the indigenous populations due to virgin land epidemics of diseases brought by Europeans, but also importantly rapid economic growth and the expansion of the number of Spaniards in New Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', Pearson 2003, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mining ===
Silver became the motor of the Spanish colonial economy both in New Spain and in Peru. It was mined under license from the crown, with a fifth of the proceeds (''[[quinto real]]'') rendered to the crown.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]] and Harry E. Cross, "Colonial Silver Mining: Mexico and Peru," ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 52:4(1972): 545–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Spaniards sought gold, and there were some small mines in Oaxaca and Michoacan, the big transformation in New Spain's economy came in the mid-sixteenth century with discoveries of large deposits of silver.&lt;ref name="Altman p. 169"&gt;Altman et al, ''Early History of Greater Mexico'' p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Close to Mexico City, the Nahua settlement of Taxco was found in 1534 to have silver.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Haskett, "Our Suffering with the Taxco Tribute: Involuntary Mine Labor and Indigenous Society in Central New Spain," ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 71:3(1991): 447–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the biggest strikes were in the north outside the zone of dense indigenous communities and Spanish settlement. Zacatecas and later Guanajuato became the most important centers of silver production, but there were many others, including in Parral (Chihuahua) and later strikes in San Luis Potosí, optimistically named after the famous Potosí silver mine of Peru.&lt;ref name="Altman p. 169" /&gt; Spaniards established of cities in the mining region as well as agrarian enterprises supplying foodstuffs and material goods necessary for the mining economy. For Mexico, which did not have a vast supply of trees to use as fuel to extract silver from ore by high heat, the invention in 1554 of the [[patio process]] that used mercury to chemically extract the silver from ore was a breakthrough.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Probert, "Bartolomé de Medina: The Patio Process and the Sixteenth Century Silver Crisis" in Bakewell, Peter, ed. ''Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas''. Variorum: Brookfield, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain had a mercury mine in [[Almadén]] whose mercury was exported to Mexico. (Peru had its own local source of mercury at [[Huancavelica]]). The higher the proportion of mercury in the process meant the higher the extraction of silver.
[[File:Minas de Almadén, Ciudad Real (RPS 21-07-2012).png|thumb|left|[[Almadén]] mercury mine in Spain]]
[[File:Cinnabar-180777.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cinnabar]] mercury amalgam from Almaden]]

The crown had a monopoly on mercury and set its price. During the [[Bourbon reforms]] of the eighteenth century, the crown increased mercury production at Almadén and lowered the price to miners by half resulting in a huge increase in Mexico's silver production.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'' p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;  As production costs dropped, mining became less risky so that there was a new surge of mine openings and improvements.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the eighteenth century, mining was professionalized and elevated in social prestige with the establishment of the royal college of mining and a miners' guild (''consulado''), making mining more respectable. The crown promulgated a new mining code that limited liability and protected patents as technical improvements were developed.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'' p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Highly successful miners purchased titles of nobility in the eighteenth century, valorizing their status in society as well as bringing revenues to the crown.&lt;ref name="Altman p. 292"&gt;Altman et al, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'' p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doris M. Ladd, ''The Mexican Nobility at Independence, 1780–1826''. Austin: University of Texas Institute of Latin American Studies 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealth from Spanish mining fueled the transatlantic economy, with silver becoming the main precious metal in circulation worldwide. Although the northern mining did not itself become the main center of power in New Spain, the silver extracted there was the most important export from the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bakewell, ''Silver Mining and Society in Colonial Mexico: Zacatecas 1546–1700''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; The control that the royal mints exerted over the uniform weight and quality of silver bars and coins made Spanish silver the most accepted and trusted currency.

Many of the laborers in the silver mines were free wage earners drawn by high wages and the opportunity to acquire wealth for themselves through the ''pepena'' system&lt;ref&gt;For their troubles, they were compensated with real salaries and, “far more important,” as Bishop Mota y Escobar perceptively wrote, “with silver ore that they got to keep and which they call among themselves pepena.” Indeed, after doing their daily work, free Indians were permitted to collect any silver-encrusted rocks they wanted. They could then sell this valuable ore in the black market or attempt to refine it into pure silver on their own. The pepena system existed in many mines throughout Mexico... Reséndez, Andrés. The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America (Kindle Locations 1857-1861). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed miners to take especially promising ore for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Already by the late sixteenth century, free wage earners outnumbered forced workers in some mines. More recent studies have revealed a sobering reality, however. While salaried workers did indeed account for a significant percentage of the workforce in many mines— including thirty-six percent of all Indians in Parral— these workers did not replace coerced laborers, but rather coexisted with them.

Reséndez, Andrés. The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America (Kindle Locations 1863-1866). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a brief period of mining in central and southern Mexico that mobilized indigenous men's involuntary labor by the ''repartimiento'', but Mexico's mines developed in the north outside of the zone of dense indigenous settlement. They were ethnically mixed and mobile, becoming culturally part of the Hispanic sphere even if their origins were indigenous. Mine workers were generally well paid with a daily wage of 4 ''reales'' per day plus a share of the ore produced, the ''partido''. In some cases, the ''partido'' was worth more than the daily wage. Mine owners sought to terminate the practice.&lt;ref name="Altman p. 292" /&gt; Mine workers pushed back against mine owners, particularly in a [[Real del Monte 1766 Strike|1766 strike]] at the Real del Monte mine, owned by the Conde de Regla, in which they closed down the mine and murdered a royal official.&lt;ref&gt;Doris M. Ladd, ''The Making of a Strike: Mexican Workers’ Struggles in Real del Monte, 1766–1775''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In the colonial period, mine workers were the elites of free workers,&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture and cattle ranching ===
[[File:Valle de México José Maria Velazco 3.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Valley of Mexico]] by [[José María Velasco Gómez|José María Velasco]]]]

Although pre-Hispanic Mexico produced surpluses of corn (maize) and other crops for tribute and subsistence use, Spaniards began commercial agriculture, cultivating wheat, sugar, fruit trees, and even for a period, [[mulberry trees]] for [[silk]] production in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', pp. 163–168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Woodrow Borah]], ''Silk Raising in Colonial Mexico''. Berkeley: University of California Press 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; Areas that had never seen indigenous cultivation became important for commercial agriculture, particularly what has been called the "near North" of Mexico, just north of indigenous settlement in central Mexico. Wheat cultivation using oxen and Spanish plows was done in the [[Bajío]], a region that includes a number of states of modern Mexico, [[Querétaro]], [[Jalisco]], and [[San Luis Potosí]].

The system of land tenure has been cited as one of the reasons that Mexico failed to develop economically during the colonial period, with large estates inefficiently organized and run and the "concentration of land ownership ''per se'' caused waste and misallocation of resources."&lt;ref&gt;Coatsworth, "Obstacles to Economic Growth," p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; These causes were posited before a plethora of studies of the [[hacienda]] and smaller agrarian enterprises as well as broader regional studies were done in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. These meticulous studies of individual haciendas and regions over time demonstrates that hacienda owners were profit-seeking entrepreneurs. They had the advantage of economies of scale that smaller holders and Indian villages did not in cultivation of grains, pulque, sugar, and [[sisal]] and in ranching, with cattle and sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Coatsworth, "Obstacles of Economic Growth", p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Great haciendas did not completely dominate the agrarian sector, since there were products that could be efficiently produced by smaller holders and Indian villages, such as fruits and vegetables, cochineal red dye, and animals that could be raised in confined spaces, such as pigs and chickens.&lt;ref name="Coatsworth p. 87"&gt;Coatsworth, "Obstacles to Economic Growth," p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Small holders also produced wine, cotton and tobacco.&lt;ref name="Coatsworth p. 87" /&gt; In the eighteenth century, the crown created a [[tobacco]] monopoly on both cultivation and manufacturing of tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Deans-Smith, ''Bureaucrats, Planters, and Workers: The Making of the Tobacco Monopoly in Bourbon Mexico''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hacendado Propriétaire by Claudio Linati 1828.jpg|thumb|left|A Mexican ''hacendado'' or estate owner by Italian lithographer [[Claudio Linati]]]]
As Spanish agrarian enterprises developed, acquiring title to land became important. As the size of the indigenous labor force dropped and as the number of Spaniards seeking land and access to labor increased, a transitional labor institution called ''repartimiento'' ("allotment") developed, in which the crown allotted indigenous labor to Spaniards on a temporary basis. Many Spanish landowners found the system unsatisfactory since they could not count on receiving an allocation that suited their needs. The repartimiento for agriculture was abolished in 1632.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al, ''Early History of Greater Mexico'' p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale landed estates or ''haciendas'' developed, and most needed both a small permanent labor force supplemented by temporary labor at peak times, such as planting and harvesting.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al, ‘’Early History of Greater Mexico’’, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and [[Stuart B. Schwartz|Stuart Schwartz]], ''Early Latin America''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle ranching need far less labor than agriculture, but did need sufficient grazing land for their herds to increase. As more Spaniards settled in the central areas of Mexico where there were already large numbers of indigenous settlements, the number of ranching enterprises declined and ranching was pushed north. Northern Mexico was mainly dry and its indigenous population nomadic or semi-nomadic, allowing Spanish ranching activities to expand largely without competition. As mining areas developed in the north, Spanish haciendas and ranches supplied products from cattle, not just meat, but hides and tallow, for the silver mining areas. Spaniards also grazed sheep, which resulted in ecological decline since sheep cropped grass to its roots preventing regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Elinor G.K. Melville, ''A plague of sheep : environmental consequences of the conquest of Mexico''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Central Mexico attracted a larger proportion of Spanish settlement and landed enterprises there shifted from mixed agriculture and ranching to solely agriculture. Ranching was more widespread in the north, with its vast expanses and little access to water. Spaniards imported seeds for production of wheat for their own consumption.
[[File:Indian collecting cochineal.jpg|right|thumb|''Indian Collecting Cochineal with a Deer Tail'' by [[José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez]] (1777). [[Cochineal]] was [[New Spain]]'s most important export product after silver and its production was almost exclusively in the hands of Indians]]
Both Spaniards and Indians produced native products commercially, particular the color-fast red dye [[cochineal]], as well as the fermented juice of the [[maguey cactus]], [[pulque]]. In the early colonial period Mexico was briefly a silk producer. When the transpacific trade with Manila developed in the late sixteenth century, the finer quality Asian silks out-competed locally produced ones.&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow W. Borah, ''Silk Raising in Colonial Mexico''. Berkeley: University of California Press 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of luxury yard goods were imported from northern Europe via Spain. For rough cloth for the urban masses, cotton and wool were produced and woven in Mexico in small workshops called ''obrajes''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Salvucci, ''Textiles and Capitalism in Mexico: An Economic History of Obrajes, 1539–1840.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cities, trade and transportation routes ===
Cities were where crown officials, high ecclesiastical officials, merchants, and artisans were centered. Mexico City, the viceregal capital, was founded on the ruins of the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]] and has never given up its primacy in Mexico. The [[history of Mexico City]] is deeply entwined in the development of the Mexican economy. Two main ports, Veracruz on the Caribbean coast the served the transatlantic trade and Acapulco on the Pacific coast, the terminus for the Asian trade via the [[Manila Galleon]], allowed the crown to regulate trade. In Spain the House of Trade (''Casa de Contratación'') in Seville registered and regulated exports and imports as well as issuing licenses for Spaniards emigrating to the New World. Exports were silver and dyestuffs and imported were luxury goods from Europe, while a local economy of high bulk, low value products were produced in Mexico. Artisans and workers of various types provided goods and services to urban dwellers. In Mexico City and other Spanish settlements, the lack of a system of potable water meant that the services of water carriers supplied individual households.
[[File:Water carrier in Mexico by Claudio Linati 1828.jpg|thumb|left|Urban Water Carrier, lithograph by [[Claudio Linati]]]]
A network of cities and towns developed, some were founded on previous indigenous city-states, (such as Mexico City) while secondary cities were established as provincial areas developed. The main axis was from Veracruz, via the well-situated city of Puebla, to Mexico City, the capital. Another axis connected Mexico City and Puebla to the mining areas of the north, centered on Guanajuato and Zacatecas. There was a road further north to New Mexico, but Mexico's far north, except for a few mining centers such as Parral, were of little economic interest. California's rich deposits of gold were unknown in the colonial era and had they been discovered that whole region's history would not be one of marginal importance.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "Trunk Lines and Feeder Lines," in ''Of Things of the Indies: Essays Old and New in Early Latin American History''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1999, 120–57.&lt;/ref&gt; To the south, trunk lines connected Mexico's center to Oaxaca and the port of Acapulco. Yucatán was more easily accessed from Cuba than Mexico City, but it had a dense Maya population so there was a potential labor force to produce products such as sugar, cacao, and later henequen (sisal).

Bad transportation was a major stumbling block to the movement of goods and people in Mexico, which had generally difficult topography. There were few paved roads and dirt tracks turned impassible during the rainy season. Rather than hauling goods by carts drawn by oxen or mules, the most common mode of transporting goods was via pack mules. Poor infrastructure was coupled with poor security, so that banditry was an impediment to the safe transport of people and goods. In the Northern area, the ''índios bárbaros'' or uncivilized Indians presented a threat to settlement and travel.
[[File:Cacique Apache by Claudio Linati 1828.png|thumb|right|Apache chief by Italian lithographer [[Claudio Linati]]]]
The eighteenth century saw New Spain increase the size and complexity of its economy. Silver remained the motor of the economy, and in fact production increased even though few new mines came into production. The key to the increased production was the lowering of the price of mercury, an essential element in refining silver. The larger the amount of mercury used in refining, the greater pure silver was extracted from ore. Another important element for the eighteenth-century economic boom was the number of wealthy Mexicans who were involved in multiple enterprises as owners, investors, or creditors. Mining is an expensive and uncertain extractive enterprise needed large capital investments for digging and shoring up shafts as well as draining water as mines got deeper.

Elites invested their fortunes in real estate, mainly in rural enterprises and to a lesser extent urban properties, with the Roman Catholic Church functioning as a mortgage bank. The Church itself accrued tremendous wealth, aided by the fact that as a corporation, its holdings were not broken up to distribute to heirs.

=== Crown policy and economic development ===
Crown policies generally impeded entrepreneurial activity in New Spain through laws and regulations that were disincentives to the creation of new enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Coatsworth, "Obstacles to Economic Development", p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no well-defined or enforceable set of property rights.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Vance, ''A Guide to the Law and Legal Literature of Mexico''. Washington, D.C. 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coatsworth p. 93"&gt;Coatsworth, "Obstacles to Economic Growth", p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lack of investment in a good system of paved roads made moving products to market insecure and expensive, so enterprises had a narrower reach for their products, particularly bulky agricultural products.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce A. Castleman, ''Building the King's Highway: Labor, Society, and Family on Mexico's Caminos Reales, 1757–1804''. Tucson: University of Arizona Press 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Although many enterprises, such as merchant houses and mining, were highly profitable, they were often family firms. The components of Roman Catholic Church had a considerable number of landed estates and the Church received income from the tithe, a ten percent tax on agricultural output. However, there were no laws that promoted "economies of scale through joint stock companies or corporations."&lt;ref name="Coatsworth p. 93" /&gt;  There were corporate entities, particularly the Church and indigenous communities, but also corporate groups with privileges (''fueros''), such as miners and merchants who had separate courts and exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;N.M. Farriss, ''Crown and Clergy in Colonial Mexico, 1759–1821: The Crisis of Ecclesiastical Privilege''. London: Athlone 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourbon Mexico 1971"&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''Miners and Merchants in Bourbon Mexico''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyle McAlister, ''"The Fuero Militar" in New Spain, 1764–1800''. Gaineville: University of Florida Press 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Borah, ''Justice by Insurance: The General Indian Court of Mexico and the Legal Aides of the Half-Real''. Berkeley: University of California Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no equal standing before the law, given the exemptions of corporate entities (including indigenous communities) and legal distinctions between races. Only those defined as Spaniards, either peninsular- or American-born of legitimate birth had access to a variety of elite privileges such as civil office holding, ecclesiastical positions, but also entrance of women into convents, which necessitated a significant dowry. A convent for Indian women of "pure blood" was established in the eighteenth century. Indian men from the mid-sixteenth century had been barred from the priesthood, not only excluding them from empowerment in the spiritual realm, but also depriving them of the honor, prestige, and income that a priest could garner.
[[File:Ignacio María Barreda - Las castas mexicanas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A single-canvas painting showing the [[casta]] system in eighteenth-century Mexico. Spaniards were at the top of the system with mixed-race men and women consigned to the bottom ranks, with both engaging in manual labor.]]
In the eighteenth century the Bourbon administrative reforms began restricting the number of American-born men appointed to office, which was not only a diminution of their own and their families’ status, but also excluded them from the revenues that flowed from office holding, not merely the salary but the networks of useful connections to do business.&lt;blockquote&gt;The interventionist and pervasively arbitrary nature of the institutional environment forced every enterprise, urban or rural, to operate in a highly politicized manner, using kinship networks, political influence, and family prestige to gain privileged access to subsidized credit, to aid various stratagems for recruiting labor, to collect debts or enforce contracts, to evade taxes or circumvent courts, and to defend titles to land.&lt;ref&gt;Coatsworth, "Obstacles to Economic Growth" p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most closely controlled commodity from New Spain (and Peru) was the production and transportation of silver. Crown officials monitored each step of the process, from licensing on those who developed mines, to transportation, to minting of uniform size and quality silver bars and coins.

The crown established monopolies in other commodities, most importantly mercury from Almadén, the key component in silver refining. But the crown also established monopolies over tobacco production and manufacturing. Guilds ("gremios") restricted the practice of certain professions, such as those engaged in painting, gilded framer makers, music instrument makers, and others. Indians and mixed–race castas were considered a threat, producing quality products far more cheaply.&lt;ref&gt;Manel Carrera Stampa, ''Los gremios mexicanos: La organización en Nueva España, 1521–1861''. Mexico: Edición y Distribución Ibero Americana Publicaciones 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crown sought to control trade and emigration to its overseas territories via the House of Trade (''Casa de Contratación''), based in Seville. Officials in Seville registered ships’ cargoes and passengers bound for the Indies (as the crown to the end of the colonial era called its territories) and upon arrival in New World ports, other crown officials inspected cargo and passengers. In Mexico, the Gulf Coast port of Veracruz, New Spain's oldest Spanish city and main port, and the Pacific coast port of Acapulco, the terminus of the [[Manila Galleon]] were busy when ships were in port, but they did not have large numbers of Spanish settlers in large part due to their disagreeable tropical climate.

Restricting trade put big merchant houses, largely family businesses, in a privileged position. A ''consulado'' a great merchant families was established in Mexico City, which raised the status of merchants, and later consulados were established in Veracruz, Guadalajara, and Guatemala City indicating the growth of a core economic group in those cities.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al. ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; Central regions could get imports those firms handled relatively easily, but with a bad transportation network, other regions became economic backwaters and smuggling and other non-sanctioned economic activity took place. The economic policy of ''comercio libre'' that was instituted in 1778, it was not full free trade but trade between ports in the Spanish empire and those in Spain; it was designed to stimulate trade. In Mexico, the big merchant families continued to dominate trade, with the main merchant house in Mexico City and smaller outlets staffed by junior members of the family in provincial cities.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; For merchants in Guatemala City dealing in indigo, they had direct contact with merchants in Cádiz, the main port in Spain, indicating the level of importance of this dye stuff in trade as well as the strengthening of previously remote areas with larger trade networks, in this case by passing Mexico City merchant houses.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; There was increased commercial traffic between New Spain, New Granada (northern South America), and Peru and during wartime, trade was permitted with neutral countries.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal trade was hampered by taxes and levies, legal and otherwise, by officials. The ''alcabala'' or sales tax was established in Spain in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and was especially favored by the crown because in Spain it did not fall under the jurisdiction of the ''cortes'' or assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Goods produced by or for Indians were exempted from the alcabala.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century, with more effective collection of the sales tax, the revenues increased significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Other taxes included the tithe, which was a ten percent tax on agricultural production; tributes paid by non-whites (Indians, Blacks and mixed-race [[castas]]); and fees for licensing and other government regulation. Crown officials (with the exception of the viceroy) often purchased their offices, with the price recouped through fees and other means.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Parry, ''The Sale of Public Office in the Indies Under the Hapsburgs''. Berkeley: University of California Press 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the late eighteenth century with the [[Bourbon reforms]], the crown established a new administrative system, the intendancy, with much better paid crown officials, with the hope that graft and other personal enrichment would not be so tempting.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al, ''Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century, there were new and increased taxes including on maize, wheat flour, and wood.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fluctuations in rainfall and harvests played havoc with the price of maize, which often resulted in civil unrest, such that the crown began establishing granaries (''alhondigas'') to moderate the fluctuations and to forestall rioting.

In a major move to tap what it thought was a major source of revenue, the crown in 1804 promulgated the Act of Consolidation (''Consolidación de Vales Reales''), in which the crown mandated that the church turn over its funds to the crown, which would in turn pay the church five percent on the principal.&lt;ref&gt;Asunción Lavrin, "The Execution of the Law of Consolidacion in New Spain: Economic Aims and Results." ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' Vol. 53, No. 1 (Feb., 1973), pp. 27-49 Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2512521&lt;/ref&gt; Since the church was the major source of credit for hacendados, miners, and merchants, the new law meant that they had to pay the principal to the church immediately. For borrowers who counted on thirty or more year mortgages to repay the principal, the law was a threat to their economic survival. For conservative elements in New Spain that were loyal to the crown, this most recent change in policy was a blow. With the Napoleonic invasion of Iberia in 1808, which placed Napoleon's brother Joseph on the Spanish throne, an impact in New Spain was to suspend the implementation on the deleterious Act of Consolidation.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', pp. 311–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Chowning, "The Consolidación de Vales Reales in the Bishopric of Michoacan," ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 69(3)(1989) 451–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Spanish intellectual [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] wrote a critique of the decline of Spain as an economic power in 1796 that contended the stagnation of Spanish agriculture was a major cause of Spain's economic problems. He recommended that the crown press for major changes in the agrarian sector, including the breakup of entailed estates, sale of common lands to individuals, and other instruments to make agriculture more profitable.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''The First America''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1991, pp. 510–12.&lt;/ref&gt; In New Spain, the bishop-elect of the diocese of Michoacan, [[Manuel Abad y Queipo]], was influenced by Jovellanos's work and proposed similar measures in Mexico. The bishop-elect's proposal for [[agrarian land reform in Mexico]] in the early nineteenth century, influenced by Jovellanos's from the late eighteenth century, had a direct impact on Mexican liberals seeking to make the agrarian sector more profitable. Abad y Queipo "fixed upon the inequitable distribution of property as the chief cause of New Spain's social squalor and advocated ownership of land as the chief remedy."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brading|D.A. Brading]], ''The First America'', p. 568.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the colonial era, land was concentrated in large haciendas and the vast number of peasants had insufficient land and the agrarian sector stagnated.

== From the era of independence to the Mexican Revolution, 1800–1920 ==

=== Late colonial era and independence, 1800–22 ===
In the late colonial era, the Spanish crown had implemented what has been called a "revolution in government", which significantly realigned New Spain's administration with significant economic impacts.&lt;ref name="Bourbon Mexico 1971"/&gt; When the Napoleonic invasion of Iberia ousted the Bourbon monarch, there was a significant period of political instability in Spain and Spain's overseas possessions, as many elements of society viewed Joseph Napoleon as an illegitimate usurper of the throne. In 1810, with the massive revolt led by secular cleric [[Miguel Hidalgo]] rapidly expanded into a social upheaval of Indians and mixed-race [[castas]] that targeted Spaniards (both peninsular-born and American-born) and their properties. American-born Spaniards who might have opted for political independence retrenched and supported to conservative elements and the insurgency for independence was a small regional struggle. In 1812, Spanish liberals adopted a written constitution that established the crown as a constitutional monarch and limited the power of the Roman Catholic Church.

[[File:ChihHidalgo1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Painting of Father [[Miguel Hidalgo]], considered the father of Mexican independence and a martyr to the cause. He was executed in the [[Government Palace of Chihuahua]]. Mural by [[Aarón Piña Mora]]]] When the Bourbon monarchy was restored in 1814, Ferdinand VII swore allegiance to the constitution, but almost immediately reneged and returned to autocratic rule and asserted his rule being "by the grace of God" as the 8 ''real'' silver of coin minted in 1821 asserts.&lt;ref&gt;image of Ferdinand VII of Spain on the eight ''real'' coin.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-French forces, particularly the British, had enabled the return of Ferdinand VII to the throne. Ferdinand's armed forces were to be sent to its overseas empire to reverse the gains that many colonial regions had gained. However, the troops mutinied and prevented a renewed assertion of royal control in the Indies.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, ''Early Latin America''. New York and Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1983, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820, Spanish liberals staged a coup and forced Ferdinand to reinstate the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] passed by the [[Cortes de Cadiz]]. For elites in New Spain, the specter of liberal policies that would have a deleterious impact on their social and economic position propelled former royalists to join the insurgent cause, thus bringing about Mexican independence in 1821. A pact between former royalist officer [[Agustín de Iturbide]] and insurgent [[Vicente Guerrero]] unified under the [[Plan de Iguala]] and the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] brought about Mexican independence in September 1821. Rather than the insurgency being a social revolution, in the end it allowed conservative forces in now independent Mexico to remain at the top of the social and economic system.

Although independence might have brought about rapid economic growth in Mexico since the Spanish crown was no longer the sovereign, Mexico's economic position in 1800 was far better than it would be for over the next hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Coatsworth, "Obstacles to Economic Growth in Nineteenth-Century Mexico"&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways the colonial economic system remained largely in place, despite the transition to formal political independence.

At the end of the colonial era, there was no national market and only poorly developed regional markets. The largest proportion of the population was poor, both peasants, who worked small holdings for subsistence or worked for low wages, and urban dwellers, most of whom were underemployed or unemployed, with only a small artisan sector. Although New Spain had been the major producer of silver and the greatest source of income for the Spanish crown, Mexico ceased to produce silver in any significant amounts until the late nineteenth century. Poor transportation, the disappearance of a ready source of mercury from Spain, and deterioration and destruction of deep mining shafts meant that the motor of Mexico's economy ground to a halt. A brief period of monarchic rule in the [[First Mexican Empire]] ended with a military coup in 1822 and the formation of a weak federated republic under the [[Constitution of 1824]].

=== Early republic to 1855 ===
{{Main|First Mexican Republic|Centralist Republic of Mexico|Second Mexican Republic}}
The early post-independence period in Mexican was organized as a federal republic under the [[Constitution of 1824]]. Mexican state was a weak institution, with regional struggles between those favoring federalism and a weak central government versus those favoring a strong central government with states subordinate to it. The weakness of the state contrasts with the strength of [[Roman Catholic Church in Mexico]], which was the exclusive religious institution with spiritual power, but it was also a major holder of real estate and source of credit for Mexican elites. The Mexican military was also a stronger institution than the state, and intervened in politics on a regular basis. Local militias also continued to exist, with the potential for both enforcing order and creating disorder.
[[File:Miliciens provinciaux de Guazacualco by Claudio Linati 1828.png|thumb|right|Militia of Guazacualco by [[Claudio Linati]], 1828]]
The new republic's situation did not promote economic growth and development.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Coatsworth, "Obstacles to Economic Growth in Nineteenth-Century Mexico," ''American Historical Review'' vol. 83, No. 1 (Feb. 1978), pp. 80–100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Haber, "Assessing the Obstacles to Industrialisation: The Mexican Economy, 1830–1940," ''Journal of Latin American Studies'', 24#1 (1992), pp. 1–32&lt;/ref&gt;  The British established a network of merchant houses in the major cities.  However, according to Hilarie J. Heath, the results were bleak:
:Trade was stagnant, imports did not pay, contraband drove prices down, debts private and public went unpaid, merchants suffered all manner of injustices and operated at the mercy of weak and corruptible governments, commercial houses skirted bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Hilarie J. Heath, "British Merchant Houses in Mexico, 1821-1860: Conforming Business Practices and Ethics," ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 73#2 (1993), pp. 261-290 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2517756 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna 1852.jpg|thumb|left|General and President [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] in 1852. The "Age of Santa Anna" is characterized by poor conditions for economic growth and development.]]
The early republic has often been called the "Age of Santa Anna," a military hero, participant in the coup ousting emperor Augustín I during Mexico's brief post-independence monarchy. He was president of Mexico on multiple occasions, seeming to prefer having the job rather than doing the job. Mexico in this period was characterized by the collapse of silver exports, political instability, and foreign invasions and conflicts that lost Mexico a huge area of its North.

The social hierarchy in Mexico was modified in the early independence era, such that racial distinctions were eliminated and the formal bars to non-whites' upward mobility were eliminated. When the Mexican republic was established in 1824, noble titles were eliminated, however, special privileges (''fueros'') of two corporate groups, churchmen and the military, remained in force so that there were differential legal rights and access to courts. Elite Mexicans dominated the agrarian sector, owning large estates. With the Roman Catholic Church still the only religion and its economic power as a source of credit for elites, conservative landowners and the Church held tremendous economic power. The largest percentage of the Mexican population was engaged in subsistence agriculture and many were only marginally engaged in market activities. Foreigners dominated commerce and trade.&lt;ref&gt;William Schell, Jr. "Banking and Finance: 1821–1910" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 1, p. 131. Chicago: Fitzroy and Dearborn 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Catedral de México.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]]. The Catholic Church was a major economic force during the colonial era and early nineteenth century]]
It was contended by Mexican liberals that the Roman Catholic Church was an obstacle to Mexico's development through its economic activities. The Church was the beneficiary of the tithe, a ten percent tax on agricultural production, until its abolition in 1833. Church properties and Indian villages produced a significant proportion of agricultural output and were outside tithe collection, while private agriculturalists' costs were higher due to the tithe. It has been argued that an impact of the tithe was in fact to keep more land in the hands of the Church and Indian villages.&lt;ref&gt;Coatsworth, ''Obstacles to Economic Growth'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; As for the uses the Church put this ten percent of the agrarian output subject to it, it has been argued that rather being spent on "unproductive" activities that the Church had a greater liquidity that could be translated into credit for enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Coatsworth, ''Obstacles to Economic Growth'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the nineteenth century, obstacles to industrialization were largely internal, while in the second half largely external.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing Obstacles to Industrialisation", pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Internal impediments to industrialization were due to Mexico's difficult topography and lack of secure and efficient transportation, remedied in the late nineteenth century by railroad construction. But the problems of entrepreneurship in the colonial period carried forward into the post-independence period. Internal tariffs, licensing for enterprises, special taxes, lack of legislation to promote joint-stock companies that protected investors, lack of enforcement to collect loans or enforce contracts, lack of patent protections, and the lack of a unified court system or legal framework to promote business made creating an enterprise a lengthy and fraught process.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing the Obstacles to Industrialisation", p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican government could not count on revenues from silver mining to fund its operations. The exit of Spanish merchants involved in the transatlantic trade was also a blow to the Mexican economy. The division of the former viceroyalty into separate states of a federal system, all needed a source of revenue to function meant that internal tariffs impeded trade.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing Obstacles to Industrialisation," p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; For the weak federal government, a large source of revenue was the customs revenue on imports and exports. The Mexican government floated loans to foreign firms in the form of bonds. In 1824 the Mexican government floated a bond taken up by a London bank, B.A. Goldschmidt and Company; in 1825 Barclay, Herring, Richardson and Company of London not only loaned more money to the Mexican government, but opened a permanent office.&lt;ref&gt;Schell, "Banking and Finance", p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of a permanent branch of Barclay, Herring, Richardson and Co. in Mexico in 1825 and then establishment of the Banco de Londres y Sud América in Mexico set the framework for foreign loans and investment in Mexico. The Banco de Londres issued paper money for private not public debt. Paper money was a first for Mexico which had long used silver coinage.&lt;ref&gt;Schell, "Banking and Finance" p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; After an extended civil war and foreign invasions, the late nineteenth century saw the more systematic growth of banking and foreign investment during the Porfiriato (1876–1911).
[[File:Lucas Alamán.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lucas Alamán]], politician and government official, founder of the Banco de Avío]]
Faced with political disruptions, civil wars, unstable currency, and the constant threat of banditry in the countryside, most wealthy Mexicans invested their assets the only stable productive enterprises that remained viable: large agricultural estates with access to credit from the Catholic Church. These entrepreneurs were later accused of preferring the symbolic wealth of tangible, secure, and unproductive property to the riskier and more difficult but innovative and potentially more profitable work of investing in industry, but the fact is that agriculture was the only marginally safe [[investment]] in times of such uncertainty. Furthermore, with low per capita income and a stagnant, shallow market, agriculture was not very profitable. The Church could have loaned money for industrial enterprises, the costs and risks of starting one in the circumstances of bad transportation and lack of consumer spending power or demand meant that agriculture was a more prudent investment.&lt;ref&gt;Coatsworth, ''Obstacles to Economic Growth in Nineteenth-Century Mexico''.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, conservative intellectual and government official [[Lucas Alamán]] founded the investment bank, Banco de Avío, in 1830 in an attempt to give direct government support to enterprise. The bank never achieved its purpose of providing capital for industrial investment and ceased to exist twelve years after its founding.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Potash, ''Mexican Government and Industrial Development: The Banco de Avío''. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite obstacles to industrialization in the early post-independence period, cotton textiles produced in factories owned by Mexicans date from the 1830s in the central region.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing Obstacles to Industrialization", p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Banco de Avío did loan money to cotton textile factories during its existence, so that in the 1840s, there were close to 60 factories in Puebla and Mexico City to supply the most robust consumer market in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing Obstacles to Industrialisation," p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In the colonial era, that region had seen the development of ''obrajes'', small-scale workshops that wove cotton and woolen cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Salvucci, ''Textiles and Capitalism in Mexico: an Economic History of the Obrajes, 1539–1840''. Princeton: Princeton University Press 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early republic, other industries developed on a modest scale, including glass, paper, and beer brewing. Other enterprises produced leather footwear, hats, wood-working, tailoring, and bakeries, all of which were small-scale and designed to serve domestic, urban consumers within a narrow market.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing Obstacles to Industrialisation," p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  There were no factories to produce machines used in manufacturing, although there was a small iron and steel industry in the late 1870s before Porfirio Díaz's regime took hold after 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, Assessing Obstacles to Industrialisation," p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the factors that impeded Mexico's own industrial development were also barriers to penetration of British capital and goods in the early republic. Small-scale manufacturing in Mexico could make a modest profit in the regions where it existed, but with high transportation costs and protective import tariffs and internal transit tariffs, there was not enough profit for British to pursue that route.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing the Obstacles to Industrialisation," p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Era of the Liberal reform and French intervention, 1855–67 ===
[[File:Portada Constitucion 1857.png|Liberal Constitution of 1857|thumb|left|The Constitution incorporated individual laws passed during the Liberal [[Reforma]] and touched off an extended conflict between Liberals and Conservatives]]
[[File:Dell'Acqua Ernennung Maximilians zum Kaiser Mexikos.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Mexican deputation, including many members of the Mexican nobility, offering the [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexican throne]] to Austrian [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Archduke Maximilian]], of the [[House of Habsburg]], and grandson of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]].]]
The Liberals' ouster of conservative [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] in 1854 ushered in a major period of institutional and economic reform, but also one of civil war and foreign invasion. The Liberal [[Reforma]] via the [[lerdo law]] abolished corporations’ right to own property as corporations, a reform aimed at breaking the economic power of the Catholic Church and of Indian communities which held land as corporate communities. The Reform also mandated equality before the law, so that the special privileges or ''fueros'' that had allowed ecclesiastics and the military personnel to be tried by their own courts were abolished. The Liberals codified the Reform in the [[Constitution of 1857]]. A civil war between Liberals and Conservatives, known as the [[War of the Reform]] or the Three Years’ War was won by Liberals, but Mexico was plunged again in conflict with the government of [[Benito Juárez]] reneging on payment of foreign loans contracted by the rival conservative government. European powers prepared to intervene for repayment of the loans, but it was France with imperial ambitions that carried out an invasion and the installation of Maximilian of Habsburg as Emperor of Mexico.

=== Restored republic, 1867–76 ===
The seeds of economic modernization were laid under the Restored Republic (1867–76), following the fall of the French-backed empire of Maximilian of Habsburg (1862–67). Mexican conservatives had invited Maximilian to be Mexico's monarch with the expectation that he would implement policies favorable to conservatives. Maximilian held liberal ideas and alienated his Mexican conservative supporters. The withdrawal of French military support for Maximilian, alienation of his conservative patrons, and post-Civil War support for Benito Juárez's republican government by the U.S. government precipitated Maximilian's fall. The conservatives' support for the foreign monarch destroyed their credibility and allowed the liberal republicans to implement economic policy as they saw fit after 1867 until the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910.

President [[Benito Juárez]] (1857–72) sought to attract foreign capital to finance Mexico's economic modernization. His government revised the tax and [[tariff]] structure to revitalize the mining industry, and it improved the transportation and communications infrastructure to allow fuller exploitation of the country's natural resources. The government issued contracts for construction of a new rail line northward to the United States, and in 1873 it finally completed the commercially vital Mexico City–Veracruz railroad, begun in 1837 but disrupted by civil wars and the French invasion from 1850 to 1868. Protected by high tariffs, Mexico's [[textile industry]] doubled its production of processed items between 1854 and 1877. Overall, manufacturing grew using domestic capital, though only modestly.

Mexican per capita income had fallen during the period 1800 until sometime in the 1860s, but began recovering during the Restored Republic. However, it was during the [[Porfiriato]] (the rule of General and President [[Porfirio Díaz]] (1876–1911)) that per capita incomes climbed, finally reaching again the level of the late colonial era. "Between 1877 and 1910 national income per capita grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent—extremely rapid growth by world standards, so fast indeed that per capita income more than doubled in thirty-three years."&lt;ref&gt;John H. Coatsworth, "Obstacles to Economic Growth in Nineteenth-Century Mexico," ''American Historical Review'' vol. 83, no. 1 (Feb. 1978) p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Porfiriato, 1876–1911 ===
During the [[Porfiriato]], Mexico underwent rapid but highly unequal growth. The railway system expanded from a single line from Mexico City to the Gulf Coast port of Veracruz to create an entire network of railways that encompassed most regions of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Coatsworth, ''Growth Against Development: The Economic Impact of Railroads in Porfirian Mexico''. DeKalb: Northern Illinois University 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial sector, mainly in textiles, in central Mexico that drew on Mexican capital and labor, vastly expanded in the late nineteenth century with the influx not only of foreign capital and entrepreneurs, but also foreign workers.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Coatsworth, "Obstacles to Economic Growth in Nineteenth-Century Mexico," ''American Historical Review'', vol. 83 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic advisers of liberal politician and military hero from the [[Battle of Puebla]], 1862, President [[Porfirio Díaz]] reversed the country's decades-long opposition to foreign investment, and by playing off British, French, and U.S. investors and governments against one another, was able to maintain a modicum of national independence. Taking "order and progress" as its watchwords, the Porfirian regime established political stability and at least an image of social peace and the rule of law. Other watchwords for Díaz's presidency were "less politics, more administration," which in practice meant the either the suppression or co-optation of political rivals, so that Díaz did not have to contend with uprisings or civil wars. Three-quarters of nineteenth-century Mexican history was plagued by internal political instability and foreign interventions.
[[File:Porfirio Diaz.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Porfirio Díaz]], liberal military hero and President of Mexico 1876–1911]]

Under Díaz, the British turned their attention in Mexico primarily to investments in railways and mines, sending both money and engineers and skilled mechanics. The British invested £7.4 million in railways during the decade of the 1880s, jumping to £53.4 million in 1910s. The decade-total of new investment in mining went from £1.3 million in 1880s to £11.6  million in 1910s. Investments in land and other properties rose from near zero in 1880s to £19.7  million in 1910s. The totals reached  £135  million, almost as much as the United States. In 1900, there were 2800 British citizens living in Mexico, a relatively small number in contrast to the 15,000 Americans,  16,000 Spaniards, 4000 French, and 2600 Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Tenenbaum, and James N. McElveen, "From speculative to substantive boom: the British in Mexico, 1821-1911." in Oliver Marshall, ed. ''English speaking communities in Latin America'' (Macmillan, 2000): 51-79, at p 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a major innovation in the late nineteenth century was large-scale foreign investment, Mexican entrepreneurs also created large enterprises, many of which were vertically integrated. Some of these include steel, cement, glass, explosives, cigarette, soap, cotton and wool textiles, and paper.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing Obstacles to Industrialization", 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yucatán underwent an agricultural boom with the creation of large-scale henequen (sisal) haciendas. Yucatán's capital of Mérida saw many elites build mansions based on the fortunes they made in henequen.

The financing of Mexican domestic industry was accomplished through a small group of merchant-financiers, who could raise the capital for high start up costs of domestic enterprises, which included the importation of machinery. Although industries were created, the national market was yet to be built so that enterprises ran inefficiently well below their capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing the Obstacles of Industrialisation," 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Overproduction was a problem since even a minor downturn in the economy meant the consumers with little buying power had to choose necessities over consumer-goods.

The apparent stability of the Porfiriato brought increased foreign capital investment to finance national development and modernization. His minister of finance, [[José Yves Limantour]] developed policies that forwarded both those aims.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schmidt, "José Ives Limantour" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 1, pp. 746–49. Fitzroy and Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign investors clustered in export related sectors, such as petroleum and mining, but the earliest and most far reaching investment was in the creation of a railway network. Railroads dramatically decreased transportation costs so that heavy or bulky products could be exported to Mexico's Gulf Coast ports as well as rail links on the U.S. border. Railroads were initially owned almost exclusively by foreign investors, expanded from 1,000 kilometers to 19,000 kilometers of track between 1876 and 1910. Railways have been termed a "critical agent of capitalist penetration,"&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Foreign and Native-Born Workers'', p. 811.&lt;/ref&gt; Railways linked areas of the country that suffered from poor transportation capability previously. The Interoceanic Railway linked Mexico City to the port of Veracruz; the Monterrey and Mexican Railroad linked that northern city with the Gulf Coast port of Tampico; the Southern Pacific of Mexico linked west coast cities from Guaymas to Mazatlan; the Sonora Railway linked Nogales to the port of Guaymas; and the Mexican Central Railroad went north to the U.S. border at El Paso, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, "Foreign and Native-Born Workers", map. p. 788&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in fundamental legal principles of ownership during the Porfiriato had a positive effect on foreign investors. During Spanish rule, the crown controlled subsoil rights of its territory so that silver mining, the motor of the colonial economy, was controlled by the crown with licenses to mining entrepreneurs was a privilege not a right. The Mexican government changed the law to giving absolute subsoil rights to property owners. For foreign investors, protection of their property rights meant that mining and oil enterprises became much more attractive investments and consistent with liberal principles. The rush of foreign investment into the extractive industries and many Mexicans' sense that they national patrimony was being usurped by foreigners became the impetus during the framing of the [[Constitution of 1917]] to return sovereignty to the nation via Article 27. In the realm of labor, in 1886, Mexico repealed laws requiring the registration of foreigners and bestowed equal rights as Mexicans held.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan C. Brown, "Foreign and Native-Born Workers in Porfirian Mexico", ''American Historical Review'' 98 (June 993) 786–818.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural banditry, which had increased following the demobilization of republican forces in 1867 fighting Maximilian's supporters, was suppressed The rural police force, known as the [[rurales]], was established under Juárez's government and increased in size and importance under Díaz. Other factors promoting a better economic situation were the elimination of local customs duties that had hindered domestic trade were abolished; increased foreign investment in mining; and communications and transportation facilities were modernized as the Mexican railroad system.

The economic growth of the Porfirian era was heavily concentrated in the north of the country—the region with the greatest concentration of mineral resources and, coincidentally, the region closest to the recently acquired Southwestern states of the United States. U.S. entrepreneurs invested heavily in mining, mineral refining operations, and the railroad system that connected northern Mexico with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan C. Brown, "Foreign and Native-Born Workers in Porfirian Mexico".&lt;/ref&gt; As the railroad system improved, and as the population grew in the western U.S., long-distance commercial agriculture became viable, and both U.S. and Mexican entrepreneurs began investing heavily in modernized large-scale agricultural estates along the railroad lines of the north. The family of future Mexican president [[Francisco I. Madero]] developed successful enterprises in the [[Comarca Lagunera]] region, which spans the states of [[Coahuila]] and [[Durango]], where cotton was commercially grown. Madero sought to interest fellow large landowners in the region in pushing for the construction of a high dam to control periodic flooding along the Nazas river;  and increase agricultural production there. One was constructed in the post-revolutionary period.&lt;ref&gt;Mikael D. Wolfe, ''Watering the Revolution: An Environmental and Technological History of Agrarian Reform in Mexico''. Durham: Duke University Press 2017, pp. 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The bilingual son of a U.S. immigrant to Mexico and the niece of the powerful Creel family of Chihuahua, [[Enrique Creel]] became a banker and intermediary between foreign investors and the Mexican government. As a powerful politician and landowner, Creel "became one of the most hated symbols of the Porfirian regime."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wasserman, "Enrique Clay Creel" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 1, p. 369. Chicago: Fitzroy and Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Enrique C Creel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Enrique Creel]], northern banker and landowner, key figure in the Díaz regime]]
The North was also the region with the smallest indigenous populations and ones that were not engaged in subsistence agriculture, so that from the colonial period onward, the North developed huge landed estates devoted mainly to cattle ranching. With the expansion of the rail network northward, linking central Mexico with the United States, northern areas that could produce crops but which previously could not get crops to market cheaply could now develop. The family of [[Francisco Madero]], who challenged Díaz for the presidency in 1910, made an agricultural fortune in Coahuila in the late nineteenth century due to the expansion of railroads. The linkage between the capital and the port of Veracruz was important for making travel and communication more efficient on the trunk line established immediately after the conquest in 1521. As the railway network increased, so too did the building of telegraph lines by the tracks, allowing for the first time rapid communication between the central government and regions of Mexico that had developed largely in isolation. If there was a telegraph report of an uprising, the rural police force and their horses could be put on trains to suppress it. The central government was thus able to effectively control its territory, and, with better security, foreign investors were more confident in putting their capital to work in Mexico by establishing businesses.

The development of the [[petroleum industry in Mexico]] on the Gulf Coast dates from the late nineteenth century. Two prominent foreign investors were [[Weetman Pearson]], who was later knighted by the British crown, and [[Edward L. Doheny]], a U.S. businessman. Oil has been an important contributor to the Mexican economy as well as an ongoing political issue, since early development was in the hands of foreigners. Economic nationalism played the key role in the [[Mexican oil expropriation]] of 1938.

Silver mining revived in Mexico during the Porfiriato and once again, silver coins from Mexico found their way to China as they had during the colonial transpacific trade of the [[Manila galleon]].

The technocratic economic advisers, the [[científico]]s,  of the late period Porfirio Díaz regime, as well as the foreign investors they invited into the country, were quite satisfied with the advances that the Mexican economy made between 1876 and 1910. Under the surface, however, popular discontent was reaching the boiling point. The economic-political elite scarcely noticed the country's widespread dissatisfaction with the political stagnation of the Porfiriato, the increased demands for worker productivity during a time of stagnating or decreasing wages and deteriorating work conditions, the repression of worker's unions by the police and army, and the highly unequal distribution of wealth. When a political opposition to the Porfirian regime developed in 1910, following Díaz's initial statement that he would not run again for the presidency in 1910 and then reneging, there was considerable unrest.

With the growth of industry in Mexico, an industrial work force was also created. Railways, mining, and petroleum were developed by foreign capital, but also brought U.S. workers from north of the border. Industrialists needed a docile, reliable workforce that showed up on time, did a full day's work, was skilled, sober, and honest. Many Mexicans willing to work for a wage continued to keep ties to their home communities, which meant they were not completely dependent on wage labor for their livelihood. Creating a skilled and loyal workforce entirely dependent on wage labor was more ideal for industrialists. Industrialists attempt to impose work discipline met considerable worker resistance, with laborers not putting in a full day or week, with Mondays notoriously a day of worker absence and termed tongue-in-cheek "San Lunes", St Monday, with workers extending the weekend a day. Workers drank, which affected their work. Wage labor, however, also created a market for [[beer in Mexico]], produced in factories built by German or Austrian immigrants to Mexico.

Foreign enterprises employed significant numbers of foreign workers, especially in skilled, higher paying positions keeping Mexicans in semi-skilled positions with much lower pay. The foreign workers did not generally know Spanish, so business transactions were done in the foreign industrialists' language. The cultural divide extended to religious affiliation (many were Protestants) and different attitudes "about authority and justice."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, "Foreign and Native-Born Workers", p. 789.&lt;/ref&gt;  There were few foreigners in the central Mexican textile industry, but many in mining and petroleum, where Mexicans had little or no experience with advanced technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, "Foreign and Native-Born Workers," p. 790.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cananea tienda de raya.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mexican workers confront the U.S. mining company during the [[Cananea]] strike of 1906.]]
Although there was a small sector of foreigners working in foreign owned industries, Mexico was not a destination for immigrants the way the United States, Argentina, and Canada were in the nineteenth century. Mexico's population in 1800 at 6 million was a million larger than that of the young U.S. republic, but in 1910 Mexico's population was 15 million while that of the U.S. was 92 million. Lack of slow natural increase and higher death rates coupled with lack of immigration meant that Mexico had a much smaller labor force in comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Coatsworth, "Obstacles to Economic Growth," p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Era of the Mexican Revolution, 1910–20 ===
The outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 began as a political crisis over presidential succession and exploded into civil wars in northern Mexico and the peasant center of the country near Mexico City. Political demands by the Mexican Liberal Party (PLM, Partido Liberal de Mexico) included many that set the political and economic agenda for the successful revolutionary faction that wrote the [[Constitution of 1917]]. That constitution had provisions that asserted the state's power over its land and subsoil rights (Article 27) that could be utilized for land reform benefiting peasants and economic nationalism that charted a course for Mexican industrialization. Labor was a big winner in the constitution, with Article 123 empowering labor to organize but more importantly put the government on the side of workers, guaranteeing an eight-day and other protections for labor. The power of the Catholic Church was curbed with even tighter restrictions on it. Although many areas that experienced warring factions' conflicts, the Gulf Coast petroleum sector escaped violence and oil revenues in fact helped fund the winning [[Constitutionalist]] faction. With the end of the armed conflict by 1920 and the new revolutionary constitution, twentieth-century presidential regimes worked to turn Mexico from a largely rural and economically stagnant country into a modern, urban, industrial power.
[[File:Portada Original de la Constitucion Mexicana de 1917.png|thumb|right|[[Constitution of 1917]] that set a new framework for the Mexican political and economic systems]]

== Consolidation of the Revolution and the Great Depression, 1920–40 ==

During the ten-year military phase of the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–20), Mexico's social and economic problems erupted.&lt;ref name=iopaz&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35749.htm |title=Mexico |publisher=State.gov |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict was regional, with the [[Constitutionalist]] faction of Mexico's North being the big winner. Organized labor in Mexico was mobilized against the peasant uprising in Morelos under [[Emiliano Zapata]], since they had fundamental interests that contrasted urban labor's need for cheap food and desire for the expansion of the industrial sector versus subsistence peasant agriculture. A major outcome of the nearly decade-long conflict was the [[Constitution of 1917]]. Organized labor was a big winner, with Article 123 enshrining in the constitution basic worker rights, such as the right to organize and strike, the eight-hour day, and safe working conditions. Organized labor could no longer be simply suppressed by the industrialists or the Mexican state. Although Mexican and foreign industrialists now had to contend with a new legal framework, the Revolution did not, in fact, destroy the industrial sector, either its factories, extractive facilities, or its industrial entrepreneurs, so that once the fighting stopped in 1917, production resumed.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing the Obstacles to Industrialisation: the Mexican Economy, 1830–1940," p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

An even more important provision of the constitution was Article 27, which empowered the state to expropriate private holdings if deemed in the national interest and returned subsoil rights to the state. Article 27 enshrined the right of the state could expropriate land and redistribute it to peasant cultivators, which was done in the 1920s and 1930s. The state's power regarding subsoil rights meant that the mining and petroleum industries that were developed and owned by foreign industrialists now had less secure title to their enterprises. The industrial sector of Mexico escaped the destruction of revolutionary violence and many Mexican and foreign industrialists remained in Mexico, but the uncertainty and risk of new investments in Mexican industry meant that it did not expand in the immediate post-Revolutionary period.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing the Obstacles to Industrialisation", p.&amp;nbsp;27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; An empowered labor movement with constitutionally guaranteed rights was a new factor industrialists also had to deal with. However, despite the protections of organized labor's rights to fair wages and working conditions, the constitution restricted laborers' ability to emigrate to the U.S. to work. It "required each Mexican to have a labor contract signed by municipal authories and the consulate of the country where they intended to work."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kelly Lytle Hernández]], "The Crimes and Consequences of Illegal Immigration: A Cross-Border Examination of Operation Wetback, 1943–1954." ''The Western Historical Quarterly'', vol. 37. no. 4 (Winter, 2006), p.423.&lt;/ref&gt; Since "U.S. law prohibited offering contracts to foreign laborers before they entered the United States," Mexicans migrating without a permission from Mexico did so illegally.&lt;ref&gt;Hernández, "The Crimes and Consequences", p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alvaro Obregón.jpg|thumbnail|left|220px|[[Álvaro Obregón]], General and President of México (1920–24), who lost an arm during the Mexican Revolution, negotiated the [[Bucareli Treaty]] with the United States, an important step in securing the legitimacy of the post-revolutionary regime]]
Concessions made to foreign oil during the Porfiriato were a particularly difficult matter in the post-Revolutionary period, but General and President [[Alvaro Obregón]] negotiated a settlement in 1923, the [[Bucareli Treaty]], that guaranteed petroleum enterprises already built in Mexico. It also settled some claims between the U.S. and Mexico stemming from the Revolution. The treaty had an important impact for the Mexican government, since it paved the way for U.S. recognition of Obregón's government. The agreement not only normalized diplomatic relations, but also opened the way for U.S. military aid to the regime and gave Obregón the means to suppress a rebellion. As the Porfiriato had demonstrated, a strong government that could maintain order paved the way for other national benefits; however, the Constitution of 1917 sought to enshrine rights of groups that suffered under that authoritarian regime.
.
General and President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] succeeded Obregón in the presidency; he was another of the revolutionary generals who then became president of Mexico. An important economic achievement of the Calles administration was the 1925 founding of the [[Banco de México]], that became the first permanent government bank (following the nineteenth-century failure of the Banco de Avío). Although this was an important economic achievement, Calles enforced the [[anticlerical]] articles of the Constitution of 1917, prompting a major outbreak of violence in the [[Cristero rebellion]] of 1926–29. Such violence in the center of the country killed tens of thousands and prompted many living in the region to migrate to the United States. For the United States, the situation was worrisome, since U.S. industrialists continued to have significant investments in Mexico and the U.S. government had a long-term desire for peace along its long southern border with Mexico. The U.S. ambassador to Mexico, [[Dwight Morrow]], a former Wall Street banker, brokered an agreement in 1929 between the Mexican government and the Roman Catholic Church, which restored better conditions for economic development.

The Mexican political system was again seen as fragile when in 1928 a religious fanatic assassinated president-elect Obregón, who would have returned to the presidency after a four-year hiatus. Calles stepped in to form in 1929 the ''Partido Nacional Revolucionario'', the precursor to the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], helped stabilize the political and economic system, creating a mechanism to manage conflicts and set the stage for more orderly presidential elections. Later that year, the U.S. stock market crashed and the Mexican economy suffered as the worldwide [[Great Depression]] took hold. It had already slowed in the 1920s, with investor pessimism and the fall of Mexican exports as well as capital flight. Even before the Great Crash of the U.S. stock market in 1929, Mexican export incomes fell between 1926 and 1928 from $334 million to $299 million (approximately 10%) and then fell even further as the Depression took hold, essentially collapsing.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing Obstacles to Industrialisation," p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, GDP dropped 16%, after drops in 1927 of 5.9%, in 1928 5.4%, and 7.7%, such that there was a drop in GDP of 30.9% in a six-year period.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing the Obstacles to Industrialisation", pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Cárdenas, ''La industrialización mexicana durante la Gran Depresión''. Mexico 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression brought Mexico a sharp drop in national income and internal demand after 1929. A complicating factor for [[Mexico-United States relations]] in this period was forced [[Mexican repatriation]] of undocumented Mexican workers in the U.S. at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Hoffman, ''Unwanted Mexican Americans in the Great Depression: Repatriation Pressures, 1929–1939''. Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Balderrama and Raymond Rodríguez, ''Decade of Betrayal: Mexican Repatriation in the 1930s''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest sector of the Mexican economy remained subsistence agriculture so that these fluctuations in the world market and the Mexican industrial sector did not affect all sectors of Mexico equally.

In the mid-1930s, Mexico's economy started to recover under the General and President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] (1934–40), which initiated a new phase of industrialization in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing Obstacles to Industrialisation," p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Cárdenas created the National Finance Bank(''Nacional Financiera SA'' (Nafinsa)).&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Nacional Financiera (México)]]&lt;/ref&gt; as a "semi-private finance company to sell rural real estate" but its mandate was expanded during the term of Cárdenas's successor, [[Manuel Avila Camacho]] term to include any enterprise in which the government had an interest.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, ''Mexico: Revolution to Evolution: 1940–1960''. New York: Oxford University Press 1963, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; An important achievement of the Cárdenas presidency was "the restoration of social peace"&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing Obstacles to Industrialisation," p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; achieved in part by not exacerbating the long simmering post-revolutionary conflict between the Mexican state and the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico, extensive redistribution of land to the peasantry, and re-organizing the party originally created by [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] into one with sectoral representation of workers, peasants, the popular sector, and the Mexican army. The ''Partido Revolucionario Mexicana'' created the mechanism to manage conflicting economic and political groups and manage national elections.

Education had always been a key factor in the nation's development, with liberals enshrining secular, public education in the [[Constitution of 1857]] and the [[Constitution of 1917]] to exclude and counter the Roman Catholic Church from its long-standing role in education. Cárdenas founded the [[Instituto Politécnico Nacional]] in 1936 in northern Mexico City, to train professional scientists and engineers to forward Mexico's economic development. The [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] traditionally trained lawyers and doctors, and in its colonial incarnation, it was a religiously affiliated university. UNAM has continued to be the main university for aspiring politicians to attend, at least as undergraduates, but the National Polytechnic Institute marked a significant step in reforming Mexican higher education.

The railroads had been nationalized in 1929 and 1930 under Cárdenas's predecessors, but his nationalization of the Mexican petroleum industry was a major move in 1938, which created ''Petroleos Mexicanos'' or [[PEMEX]].
Cárdenas also nationalized the paper industry, whose best-selling product was newsprint. In Mexico the paper industry was controlled by a single firm, the San Rafael y Anexas paper company. Since there was no well-developed capital market in Mexico ca. 1900, a single company could dominate the market. But in 1936, Cárdenas considered newsprint a strategic company and nationalized it. By nationalizing it, a company with poor prospects for flourishing could continue via government support.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, "Assessing the Obstacles to Industrialisation," pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, agricultural production also rose steadily, and urban employment expanded in response to rising domestic demand. The government offered tax incentives for production directed toward the home market. [[Import-substitution industrialization]] began to make a slow advance during the 1930s, although it was not yet official government policy.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

To foster industrial expansion, the administration of [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]] (1940–46) in 1941 reorganized the National Finance Bank.
During his presidency, Mexico's economy recovered from the Depression and entered a period of sustained growth, known as the [[Mexican Miracle]].

Mexico's inward-looking development strategy produced sustained economic growth of 3 to 4 percent and modest 3 percent inflation annually from the 1940s until the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} This growth was sustained by the government's increasing commitment to primary education for the general population from the late 1920s through the 1940s.

''The Journal of Economic History'' Vol. 41 No. 1, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; consequently when this generation was employed by the 1940s their economic output was more productive. Additionally, the government fostered the development of consumer goods industries directed toward domestic markets by imposing high protective tariffs and other barriers to imports. The share of imports subject to licensing requirements rose from 28 percent in 1956 to an average of more than 60 percent during the 1960s and about 70 percent in the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Industry accounted for 22 percent of total output in 1950, 24 percent in 1960, and 29 percent in 1970.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The share of total output arising from agriculture and other primary activities declined during the same period, while services stayed constant. The government promoted industrial expansion through public investment in agricultural, energy, and transportation infrastructure. Cities grew rapidly during these years, reflecting the shift of employment from agriculture to industry and services. The urban population increased at a high rate after 1940 (see Urban Society, ch. 2).

Although growth of the urban labor force exceeded even the growth rate of industrial employment, with surplus workers taking low-paying service jobs, many Mexican laborers migrated to the United States where wages were higher. During World War II, [[Mexico-United States relations]] had improved significantly from the previous three decades. The [[Bracero Program]] was set up with orderly migration flows were regulated by both governments. However. many Mexicans could not qualify for the program and migrated north illegally, without permission from their own government and without sanction from the U.S. authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Hernández, "The Crimes and Consequences of Illegal Immigration," p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war period as the U.S. economy boomed and as Mexico's entered a phase of rapid industrialization, the U.S. and Mexico cooperated closely on illegal border crossings by Mexicans. For the Mexican government, this loss of labor was "a shameful exposure of the failure of the Mexican Revolution to provide economic well-being for many of Mexico's citizens, but it also drained the country of one of its greatest natural resources, a cheap and flexible labor supply."&lt;ref&gt;Hernández, "The Crimes and Consequences of Immigration," p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. and Mexico cooperated closely to stop the flow, including the 1954 program called [[Operation Wetback]].
[[File:Papaloapanrivermap.png|thumb|Map of the Papaloapan River drainage basin before construction of the [[Cerro de Oro Dam]], showing the [[Miguel Alemán Lake ]](center)]]
In the years following [[World War II]], President [[Miguel Alemán Valdés]]'s (1946–52) full-scale import-substitution program stimulated output by boosting internal demand. The government raised import controls on consumer goods but relaxed them on capital goods, which it purchased with international reserves accumulated during the war. The government spent heavily on infrastructure. By 1950 Mexico's road network had expanded to 21,000 kilometers, of which some 13,600 were paved. Large-scale dam building for [[hydroelectric]] power and flood control were initiated, most prominently the Papaloapan Project in southern Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, ''The United States and Mexico'', revised and enlarged edition. New York: Atheneum 1963, (originally published by Harvard University Press 1953, pp. 374–75, 382–85.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been a re-evaluation of such infrastructure projects, particularly their negative impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick H. Cosby, "Leviathan in the Tropics: A postcolonial environmental history of the Papaloapan Projects in Mexico." PhD diss. University of Florida 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico's strong economic performance continued into the 1960s, when GDP growth averaged about 7 percent overall and about 3 percent per capita. Consumer price inflation averaged only 3 percent annually. Manufacturing remained the country's dominant growth sector, expanding 7 percent annually and attracting considerable foreign investment. Mining grew at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent, trade at 6 percent, and agriculture at 3 percent. By 1970 Mexico had diversified its export base and become largely self-sufficient in food crops, steel, and most [[consumer good]]s. Although its imports remained high, most were [[capital good]]s used to expand domestic production.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Deterioration in the 1970s ==
Although the Mexican economy maintained its rapid growth during most of the 1970s, it was progressively undermined by fiscal mismanagement and by a poor export industrial sector and a resulting sharp deterioration of the investment climate. The GDP grew more than 6 percent annually during the administration of President [[Luis Echeverría Álvarez]] (1970–76), and at about a 6 percent rate during that of his successor, [[José López Portillo y Pacheco]] (1976–82). But economic activity fluctuated wildly during the decade, with spurts of rapid growth followed by sharp depressions in 1976 and 1982.
[[File:Jose Lopez Portillo.jpg|thumb|left|[[José López Portillo]], President of Mexico 1976–82, whose government borrowed heavily from foreign banks with loans in dollars against future oil revenues, crashed the Mexican economy when the price of oil dropped]]

Fiscal profligacy combined with the [[1973 oil shock]] to exacerbate inflation and upset the balance of payments. Moreover, President Echeverría's leftist rhetoric and actions—such as abetting illegal land seizures by peasants—eroded investor confidence and alienated the private sector. The [[balance of payments]] disequilibrium became unmanageable as capital flight intensified, forcing the government in 1976 to devalue the peso by 58 percent. The action ended Mexico's twenty-year [[fixed exchange rate]]. Mexico accepted an IMF adjustment program and received financial backing from the United States. According to a 2017 study, "Key US and Mexican officials recognized that an IMF program of currency devaluation and austerity would probably fail in its stated objective of reducing Mexico's balance of payments deficit. Nevertheless, US Treasury and Federal Reserve officials, fearing that a Mexican default might lead to bank failures and subsequent global financial crisis, intervened to an unprecedented degree in the negotiations between the IMF and Mexico. The United States offered direct financial support and worked through diplomatic channels to insist that Mexico accept an IMF adjustment program, as a way of bailing out US banks. Mexican president Luis Echeverría's administration consented to IMF adjustment because officials perceived it as the least politically costly option among a range of alternatives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kershaw|first=Paul V.|date=2017-05-16|title=Averting a global financial crisis: the US, the IMF, and the Mexican debt crisis of 1976|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07075332.2017.1326966|journal=The International History Review|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/07075332.2017.1326966|issn=0707-5332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although significant oil discoveries in 1976 allowed a temporary recovery, the windfall from petroleum sales also allowed continuation of Echeverría's destructive fiscal policies. In the mid-1970s, Mexico went from being a net importer of oil and petroleum products to a significant exporter. Oil and petrochemicals became the economy's most dynamic growth sector. Rising oil income allowed the government to continue its expansionary fiscal policy, partially financed by higher foreign borrowing. Between 1978 and 1981, the economy grew more than 8 percent annually, as the government spent heavily on energy, transportation, and basic industries. Manufacturing output expanded modestly during these years, growing by 8.2 percent in 1978, 9.3 percent in 1979, and 8.2 percent in 1980.

This renewed growth rested on shaky foundations. Mexico's external indebtedness mounted, and the peso became increasingly overvalued, hurting non-oil exports in the late 1970s and forcing a second peso devaluation in 1980. Production of basic food crops stagnated and the population increase was skyrocketing, forcing Mexico in the early 1980s to become a net importer of foodstuffs. The portion of import categories subject to controls rose from 20 percent of the total in 1977 to 24 percent in 1979. The government raised tariffs concurrently to shield domestic producers from foreign competition, further hampering the modernization and competitiveness of Mexican industry.

== 1982 crisis and recovery ==
{{See also|La Década Perdida}}
The macroeconomic policies of the 1970s left Mexico's economy highly vulnerable to external conditions. These turned sharply against Mexico in the early 1980s, and caused the worst [[recession]] since the 1930s, with the period known in Mexico as [[La Década Perdida]], "the lost decade", i.e., of economic growth. By mid-1981, Mexico was beset by [[1980s oil glut|falling oil prices]], higher world interest rates, rising inflation, a chronically overvalued [[peso]], and a deteriorating balance of payments that spurred massive [[capital flight]]. This disequilibrium, along with the virtual disappearance of Mexico's [[international reserves]]—by the end of 1982 they were insufficient to cover three weeks' imports—forced the government to devalue the peso three times during 1982. The devaluation further fueled inflation and prevented short-term recovery. The devaluations depressed real wages and increased the private sector's burden in servicing its dollar-denominated debt. Interest payments on long-term debt alone were equal to 28 percent of export revenue. Cut off from additional credit, the government declared an involuntary moratorium on debt payments in August 1982, and the following month it announced the nationalization of Mexico's private banking system.
[[File:De la madrid1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Miguel de la Madrid]], President of Mexico 1982–88, who dealt with the financial debacle of the 1980s]]
By late 1982, incoming President [[Miguel de la Madrid]] reduced public spending drastically, stimulated exports, and fostered economic growth to balance the national accounts. Recovery was slow to materialize, however. The economy stagnated throughout the 1980s as a result of continuing negative terms of trade, high domestic interest rates, and scarce credit. Widespread fears that the government might fail to achieve fiscal balance and have to expand the money supply and raise taxes deterred private investment and encouraged massive capital flight that further increased inflationary pressures. The resulting reduction in domestic savings impeded growth, as did the government's rapid and drastic reductions in public investment and its raising of real domestic interest rates to deter capital flight.

Mexico's GDP grew at an average rate of just 0.1 percent per year between 1983 and 1988, while inflation on an average of 100%. Public consumption grew at an average annual rate of less than 2 percent, and private consumption not at all. Total investment fell at an average annual rate of 4 percent and public investment at an 11 percent pace. Throughout the 1980s, the productive sectors of the economy contributed a decreasing share to GDP, while the services sectors expanded their share, reflecting the rapid growth of the informal economy and the change from good jobs to bad ones (services jobs). De la Madrid's stabilization strategy imposed high social costs: real [[disposable income]] per capita fell 5 percent each year between 1983 and 1988. High levels of unemployment and [[underemployment]], especially in rural areas, stimulated migration to [[Mexico City]] and to the United States.

By 1988 (de la Madrid's final year as President) inflation was at last under control, fiscal and monetary discipline attained, relative price adjustment achieved, structural reform in trade and public-sector management underway, and the economy was bound for recovery. But these positive developments were inadequate to attract foreign investment and return capital in sufficient quantities for sustained recovery. A shift in development strategy became necessary, predicated on the need to generate a net [[capital inflow]].

In April 1989, President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] announced his government's national development plan for 1989–94, which called for annual GDP growth of 6 percent and an inflation rate similar to those of Mexico's main trading partners. Salinas planned to achieve this sustained growth by boosting the investment share of GDP and by encouraging private investment through [[denationalization]] of state enterprises and [[deregulation]] of the economy. His first priority was to reduce Mexico's external debt; in mid-1989 the government reached agreement with its commercial bank creditors to reduce its medium- and long-term debt. The following year, Salinas took his next step toward higher capital inflows by lowering domestic borrowing costs, reprivatizing the banking system, and broaching the idea of a free-trade agreement with the United States. These announcements were soon followed by increased levels of capital repatriation and foreign investment.

Due to the financial crisis that took place in 1982, the total public investment on infrastructure plummeted from 12.5% of GDP to 3.5% in 1989. After rising during the early years of Salinas' presidency, the growth rate of real GDP began to slow during the early 1990s. During 1993 the economy grew by a negligible amount, but growth rebounded to almost 4 percent during 1994, as fiscal and monetary policy were relaxed and foreign investment was bolstered by United States ratification of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). In 1994 the commerce and services sectors accounted for 22 percent of Mexico's total GDP. Manufacturing followed at 20 percent; transport and communications at 10 percent; agriculture, forestry, and fishing at 8 percent; construction at 5 percent; mining at 2 percent; and electricity, gas, and water at 2 percent (services 80%, industry and mining 12%, agriculture 8%). Some two-thirds of GDP in 1994 (67 percent) was spent on private consumption, 11 percent on public consumption, and 22 percent on fixed investment. During 1994 private consumption rose by 4 percent, public consumption by 2 percent, public investment by 9 percent, and private investment by 8 percent.

== 1993: Hyperinflation and the ''Nuevo Peso'' ==
The nuevo peso (new peso) was the result of hyperinflation in Mexico. In 1993, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari stripped three zeros from the peso, creating a parity of $1 new peso for $1000 of the old ones.

January 1, 1994, the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada went into effect.
[[File:NAFTA logo.svg|thumb|left|Logo for the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]]]

The collapse of the new peso in December 1994 and the ensuing economic crisis caused the economy to contract by an estimated 7 percent during 1995. Investment and consumption both fell sharply, the latter by some 10 percent. Agriculture, livestock, and fishing contracted by 4 percent; mining by 1 percent; manufacturing by 6 percent; construction by 22 percent; and transport, storage, and communications by 2 percent. The only sector to register positive growth was utilities, which expanded by 3 percent.

By 1996 Mexican government and independent analysts saw signs that the country had begun to emerge from its economic recession. The economy contracted by 1 percent during the first quarter of 1996. The Mexican government reported growth of 7 percent for the second quarter, and the Union Bank of Switzerland forecast economic growth of 4 percent for all of 1996.

== 2011: 40 years of lag in income ==
{{expand section|date=August 2013}}
Data by the Encuesta Nacional Ingreso Gasto de los Hogares (ENIGH) revealed that one minimum wage in 1970 equals 3 minimum wages in 2010. That is expressed in real salaries, which means the real buying power of salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El deterioro salarial suma 40 años en México|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/graficos/graficosanimados11/EU_deterioro_salarial/encuesta.html|work=El Universal|accessdate=21 May 2013|author=Ixel Yutzil González|author2=Mónica Rodriguez Sosa |author3=Mario Benítez Rétiz |language=Spanish|date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El deterioro salarial suma 40 años en México|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/primera/36804.html|accessdate=21 May 2013|author=Ixchel Yutzil González|language=Spanish|date=9 May 2011|quote=Wages lag 40 years in Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mexico and China ==
China has attempted to expand its investment and trade in Mexico in recent years, similar to China's moves elsewhere in Latin America and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=29 January 2015 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-30982544|title=Why Latin America should not squander the China boom|author= Kevin P Gallagher|publisher=BBC News|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; China was set to construct a $200 million, 1,400-acre mega-mall, Dragon Mart, near the beach resort of Cancún. The mall would have been not only a major emporium of Chinese goods, but also a gateway for Chinese goods elsewhere in the hemisphere. Mexican environmentalists have opposed the project on the grounds of environmental degradation of sensitive wetlands. The city of [[Cancún]] initially turned down the permit for the Chinese to build, but they appealed to the state of [[Quintana Roo]] and the federal government, which granted the permit. The government of [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] reversed that decision in January 2015. Mexico's environmental protection agency's head, Guillermo Haro, has cancelled the contract and imposed a fine of $1.5 million for damage already done. The mega-mall was likened to a permanent trade show, with booths for 3,000 exhibitors. Mexican industrialists were pleased with the government's decision because the mega-mall was expected to flood the Mexican market with Chinese goods. Environmentalists hailed the decision as a victory and a precedent for evaluating future projects. In November 2014, the Mexican government cancelled a contract for China to build a bullet train in Mexico. One of the successful bidders on that contract sold a mansion to the wife of the president on favorable terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eedition2.latimes.com/Olive/ODE/LATimes2/LandingPage/LandingPage.aspx?href=TEFULzIwMTUvMDEvMjk.&amp;pageno=MQ..&amp;entity=QXIwMDEwMg..&amp;view=ZW50aXR5|authors=Cecilia Sanchez and Tracy Wilkinson|title=Mexico Halts Massive Chinese Project|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=29 January 2015|page= A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The award was rescinded and a new bidding was to take place in 2015, but the government has "indefinitely suspended" the project.&lt;ref name=Tracy&gt;Tracy Wilkinson, "Mexico, buffeted by low oil prices, cuts spending," ''Los Angeles Times'', Saturday, January 31, 2015, p. A7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts of drop in oil prices, 2014–15 ==
Mexico has again felt the negative impact of the drop in oil prices, with the government cutting planned spending in 2015 and likely 2016 as well. Estimates are the one-third of Mexico's revenues come from petroleum, so that with oil prices going from $100/barrel in mid-2014 to $38/barrel in January 2015, the government is squeezed financially.&lt;ref name="Tracy" /&gt;  The Minister of Finance, Luis Videgaray, moved to curtail spending by cancelling a rail project in Yucatán, shelving indefinitely a joint China-Mexico bullet train project, and there were to be cutbacks in the Mexican state oil company, Pemex, and in the education ministry.&lt;ref name="Tracy"/&gt;  Gas prices for Mexicans have risen, and the U.S. dollar is strengthening against the peso, so that Mexican consumers are under pressure.&lt;ref name="Tracy"/&gt;

[[File:Lustra (private print) - Ezra Pound - Frontispiece.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph of Ezra H. Pound|Ezra Pound photographed in 1913 by [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]]]]

'''Ezra Weston Loomis Pound''' (30 October 1885&amp;nbsp;– 1 November 1972) was an [[expatriate]] American poet and critic, and a major figure in the early [[modernist poetry]] movement. His contribution to poetry began with his development of [[Imagism]], a movement derived from classical [[Chinese poetry|Chinese]] and [[Japanese poetry|Japanese]] poetry, stressing clarity, precision and economy of language. His works include ''[[Ripostes]]'' (1912), ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' (1920) and the unfinished 120-section epic, ''[[The Cantos]]'' (1917–1969).

Pound worked in London during the early 20th century as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, and helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[James Joyce]], [[Robert Frost]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]].{{efn|[[Ernest Hemingway]] wrote in 1925: "[W]e have Pound the major poet devoting, say, one fifth of his time to poetry. With the rest of his time he tries to advance the fortunes, both material and artistic, of his friends. He defends them when they are attacked, he gets them into magazines and out of jail. He loans them money. He sells their pictures. He arranges concerts for them. He writes articles about them. He introduces them to wealthy women. He gets publishers to take their books. He sits up all night with them when they claim to be dying and he witnesses their wills. He advances them hospital expenses and dissuades them from suicide. And in the end a few of them refrain from knifing him at the first opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway, "Homage to Ezra", ''This Quarter'', 1, Spring 1925, 221–225, in Hemingway (2006), 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;}} Angered by the carnage of [[World War I]], Pound lost faith in [[Great Britain]] and blamed the war on [[usury]] and international capitalism. He moved to Italy in 1924 and throughout the 1930s and 1940s embraced [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian Fascism|fascism]], expressed support for [[Adolf Hitler]], and wrote for publications owned by the British fascist [[Sir Oswald Mosley]]. During [[World War II]], he was paid by the Italian government to make hundreds of radio broadcasts criticizing the United States, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Jews]], as a result of which he was arrested in 1945 by American forces in Italy on charges of [[treason]]. He spent months in detention in a U.S. military camp in [[Pisa]], including three weeks in a {{convert|6|by|6|ft|m|adj=on}} outdoor steel cage, which he said triggered a mental breakdown: "when the raft broke and the waters went over me". The following year he was deemed unfit to stand trial, and incarcerated in [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|St. Elizabeths]] psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C., for over 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pisan Cantos'' (80.665–67), Sieburth (2003), xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound began work on sections of ''The Cantos'' while in custody in Italy. These parts were published as ''[[The Cantos#LXXIV–LXXXIV (The Pisan Cantos)|The Pisan Cantos]]'' (1948), for which he was awarded the [[Bollingen Prize]] in 1949 by the [[Library of Congress]], leading to enormous controversy. Largely due to a campaign by his fellow writers, he was released from St. Elizabeths in 1958 and returned to live in Italy until his death. His political views ensure that his work remains as controversial now as it was during his lifetime; in 1933 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called him "a cat that walks by himself, tenaciously unhousebroken and very unsafe for children". Hemingway wrote: "The best of Pound's writing—and it is in the ''Cantos''—will last as long as there is any literature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,745380,00.html "Books: Unpegged Pound"], ''Time'', 20 March 1933; Hemingway (2006), 25, from ''The Cantos of Ezra Pound: Some Testimonies by Ernest Hemingway, Ford Madox Ford, T. S. Eliot, Hugh Walpole, Archibald McLeish, James Joyce, and Others'', Farrar &amp; Rinehart, March 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life (1885–1908)==

===Background===
{{see also|Homer Pound House}}
[[File:Thaddeus C. Pound - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|[[Thaddeus C. Pound|Thaddeus Pound]], Pound's grandfather, in the late 1880s]]
Pound was born in a small, two-story house in [[Hailey, Idaho|Hailey]], [[Idaho Territory]], the only child of Homer Loomis Pound (1858–1942) and Isabel Weston (1860–1948). His father had worked in Hailey since 1883 as registrar of the [[General Land Office]].&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 4; Ridler, Keith. [http://seattletimes.com/html/travel/2004430400_tridahopoet25.html "Poet's Idaho home is reborn"], Associated Press, 25 May 2008; for Idaho Territory, see Wilson (2014), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both parents' ancestors had emigrated from England in the 17th century. On his mother's side, Pound was descended from [[William Wadsworth (patriarch)|William Wadsworth]] (1594–1675), a [[Puritanism|Puritan]] who emigrated to Boston on the ''[[English ship Lion (1557)|Lion]]'' in 1632.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 11&lt;/ref&gt; The Wadsworths married into the Westons of New York. Harding Weston and Mary Parker were the parents of Isabel Weston, Ezra's mother.&lt;ref name=Moodyxiii/&gt; Harding apparently spent most of his life without work, with his brother, Ezra Weston, and his brother's wife, Frances, looking after Mary and Isabel's needs.&lt;ref name ="Cockram238"/&gt;

On his father's side, the immigrant ancestor was John Pound, a [[Quaker]], who arrived from England around 1650. Ezra's grandfather, [[Thaddeus C. Pound|Thaddeus Coleman Pound]] (1832–1914), was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman from northwest [[Wisconsin]] who had made and lost a fortune in the lumber business. Thaddeus's son Homer, Pound's father, worked for Thaddeus in the lumber business until Thaddeus secured him the appointment as registrar of the Hailey land office. Homer and Isabel married the following year and Homer built a [[Homer Pound House|house in Hailey]].&lt;ref name=Moodyxiii&gt;Moody (2007), xiii–13&lt;/ref&gt; Isabel was unhappy in Hailey and took Ezra with her to New York in 1887, when he was 18 months old.&lt;ref name ="Cockram238"&gt;Cockram (2005), 238&lt;/ref&gt; Homer followed them, and in 1889 he found a job as an [[Metallurgical assay|assayer]] at the [[Philadelphia Mint]]. The family moved to [[Jenkintown, Pennsylvania]], and in 1893 bought a six-bedroom house in [[Wyncote, Pennsylvania|Wyncote]].&lt;ref name=Moodyxiii/&gt;

===Education===
[[File:EzraPound&amp;IsabelPound1898.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=photograph|Pound, in his Cheltenham Military Academy uniform, with his mother in 1898]]
Pound's education began in a series of [[dame school]]s, some of them run by Quakers: Miss Elliott's school in Jenkintown in 1892, the Heathcock family's Chelten Hills School in Wyncote in 1893, and the Florence Ridpath school from 1894, also in Wyncote.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), xiii&lt;/ref&gt; His first publication was on 7 November 1896 in the ''Jenkintown Times-Chronicle'' ("by E. L. Pound, Wyncote, aged 11 years"), a [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]] about [[William Jennings Bryan]], who had just lost the [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896 presidential election]]: "There was a young man from the West, / He did what he could for what he thought best; / But election came round, / He found himself drowned, / And the papers will tell you the rest."&lt;ref&gt;Rachewiltz, Moody and Moody (2011), x&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1897 and 1900 Pound attended Cheltenham Military Academy, sometimes as a boarder, where he specialized in Latin. The boys wore [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-style uniforms and besides Latin were taught English, history, arithmetic, marksmanship, military drilling and the importance of submitting to authority. Pound made his first trip overseas in mid-1898 when he was 13, a three-month tour of Europe with his mother and Frances Weston (Aunt Frank), who took him to England, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- reference for previous two sentences --&gt; After the academy he may have attended Cheltenham Township High School for one year, and in 1901, aged 15, he was admitted to the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s College of Liberal Arts.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 14; for Cheltenham Township High School, see McDonald (2005), 91, and Stock (1970), 11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hdpoet.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|[[H.D.]], c. 1921. She followed Pound to London and became involved in developing [[Imagism]].]]
Pound met Hilda Doolittle (later known as the poet [[H.D.]]) at Pennsylvania in 1901, and she became his first serious romance.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (2004), 18; Barnstone (1998), 202&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 she followed Pound to London and became involved in developing the Imagism movement. Between 1905 and 1907 Pound wrote a number of poems for her, 25 of which he hand-bound and called ''Hilda's Book'',&lt;ref&gt;Doolittle (1979), 67–68; ''Hilda's Book'' is in the [[Houghton Library]] at Harvard; see [https://web.archive.org/web/20040607154442/http://loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=201&amp;section=notes "Poems and Translations"], Library of America.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1908 he asked her father, the astronomy professor Charles Doolittle, for permission to marry her, but Doolittle dismissed Pound as a nomad.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (2004), 31&lt;/ref&gt; Pound was seeing two other women at the same time—Viola Baxter and Mary Moore—later dedicating a book of poetry, ''Personae'' (1909), to the latter. He asked Moore to marry him too, but she turned him down.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 24–28; for dedication of ''Personae'', see Nadel (1999), xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents and Frances Weston took Pound on another three-month European tour in 1902, after which he transferred, in 1903, to [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in Clinton, New York, possibly because of poor grades. Signed up for the Latin–Scientific course, he studied the [[Provençal dialect]] with William Pierce Shephard and [[Old English]] with Joseph D. Ibbotson; with Shephard he read [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and from this began the idea for a long poem in three parts—of emotion, instruction and contemplation—planting the seeds for ''The Cantos''.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 18–25&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in 1913, in "How I Began":

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;I resolved that at thirty I would know more about poetry than any man living&amp;nbsp;... that I would know what was accounted poetry everywhere, what part of poetry was 'indestructible', what part could ''not be lost'' by translation and—scarcely less important—what effects were obtainable in ''one'' language only and were utterly incapable of being translated.{{pb}}In this search I learned more or less of nine foreign languages, I read Oriental stuff in translations, I fought every University regulation and every professor who tried to make me learn anything except this, or who bothered me with "requirements for degrees".&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1964), 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pound graduated from Hamilton College with a BPhil in 1905, then studied [[Romance languages]] under Hugo A. Rennert at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), where he obtained an MA in early 1906 and registered to write a PhD thesis on the jesters in [[Lope de Vega]]'s plays. A Harrison fellowship covered his tuition fees and gave him a travel grant of $500, which he used to return to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 19, 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; Pound spent three weeks in Madrid in various libraries, including one in the royal palace. There, on 31 May 1906, he happened to be standing outside when the attempted assassination of [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso]] took place, and Pound subsequently left the country for fear he would be identified with the anarchists. After Spain he spent two weeks in Paris, attending lectures at the [[Sorbonne]], followed by a week in London.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

In July he returned to the United States, where in September his first essay, "Raphaelite Latin", was published in ''Book News Monthly''. He took courses in the English department at Penn in 1907, where he fell out with several lecturers; during lectures on Shakespeare by [[Felix Emanuel Schelling|Felix Schelling]], the department head, he would wind an enormous tin watch very slowly while Schelling spoke. His fellowship was not renewed. Schelling told him that he was wasting everyone's time, and Pound left without finishing his doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
From late 1907 Pound taught Romance languages at [[Wabash College]] in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]], a conservative town that he called "the [[Inferno (Dante)#Sixth Circle (Heresy)|sixth circle of hell]]". The equally conservative college dismissed him after he deliberately provoked the college authorities. Smoking was forbidden, but he would smoke [[cigarillo]]s in his office down the corridor from the president's. He annoyed his landlords by entertaining friends, including women, and was forced out of one house after "[t]wo stewdents found me sharing my meagre repast with the lady–gent impersonator in my privut apartments", he told a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

He was asked to leave the college in 1908 after offering a stranded chorus girl tea and his bed for the night when she was caught in a snowstorm. When she was discovered the next morning by the landladies, Ida and Belle Hall, his insistence that he had slept on the floor was met with disbelief. Glad to be free of the place, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 60–62; Wilhelm (1985), 177; Carpenter (1988), 80; Nadel (2004), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==London (1908–1920)==

===Introduction to the literary scene===
Pound arrived in [[Gibraltar]] on 23 March 1908, where for a few weeks he earned $15 a day working as a guide to American tourists. By the end of April he was in [[Venice]], living over a bakery near the San Vio bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 62, 63; for the bakery, Tytell (1987), 35&lt;/ref&gt; In July he self-published his first book of poetry, ''[[A Lume Spento]]'' (''With Tapers Quenched''). The  ''London Evening Standard'' called it "wild and haunting stuff, absolutely poetic, original, imaginative, passionate, and spiritual".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1917), 5&lt;/ref&gt; The title was from the third canto of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Purgatorio]]'', which alluded to the death of [[Manfred, King of Sicily]]. The book was dedicated to his friend, the Philadelphia artist [[William Brooke Smith]], who had recently died of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinnes (1980), xi; for information about Brooke Smith, see Carpenter (1988), 91, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:48 Langham Street, London W1.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|upright|48 Langham Street, London W1]]
In August Pound moved to London, where he lived almost continuously for the next 12 years; he told his university friend [[William Carlos Williams]]: "London, deah old Lundon, is the place for poesy." English poets such as [[Maurice Hewlett]], [[Rudyard Kipling]] and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]] had made a particular kind of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] verse—stirring, pompous and propagandistic—popular with the public. According to modernist scholar James Knapp, Pound rejected the idea of poetry as "versified moral essay"; he wanted to focus on the individual experience, the concrete rather than the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp (1979), 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving in the city with just ₤3, he moved into lodgings at 48 Langham Street, near [[Great Titchfield Street]], a penny bus ride from the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; The house sat across an alley from the Yorkshire Grey pub, which made an appearance in the ''Pisan Cantos'', "concerning the landlady's ''doings'' / with a lodger unnamed / az waz near Gt Titchfield St. next door to the pub".&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), 4; Pound (2003), 80, lines 334–336; also see Campbell, James. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/17/poetry3 "Home from home"], ''The Guardian'', 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound persuaded the bookseller [[Charles Elkin Mathews|Elkin Mathews]] to display ''A Lume Spento'', and by October 1908 he was being discussed by the literati. In December he published a second collection, ''A Quinzaine for This Yule'', and after the death of a lecturer at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]] he managed to acquire a position lecturing in the evenings, from January to February 1909, on "The Development of Literature in Southern Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), 5–11&lt;/ref&gt; He would spend his mornings in the [[British Museum Reading Room]], then lunch at the Vienna Café on [[Oxford Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), 7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ford Madox Ford]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;Ezra&amp;nbsp;... would approach with the step of a dancer, making passes with a cane at an imaginary opponent. He would wear trousers made of green billiard cloth, a pink coat, a blue shirt, a tie hand-painted by a Japanese friend, an immense sombrero, a flaming beard cut to a point, and a single, large blue earring.&lt;ref&gt;Ford 1999, 277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hemingway described Pound as "tall&amp;nbsp;... [with] a patchy red beard, fine eyes, strange haircuts and&amp;nbsp;... very shy": "But he has the temperament of a ''[[Spanish Fighting Bull|toro di lidia]]'' from the breeding establishments of [[Miura bull|Don Eduardo Miura]]. No one ever presents a cape, or shakes a [[muleta]] at him without getting a charge."&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (2006), 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meeting Dorothy Shakespear, ''Personae''===
At a literary [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] in January 1909, Pound met the novelist [[Olivia Shakespear]] and her daughter [[Dorothy Shakespear|Dorothy]], who became his wife in 1914. Through Olivia Shakespear he was introduced to her former lover [[W. B. Yeats]], in Pound's view the greatest living poet. Pound had sent Yeats a copy of ''A Lume Spento'' the previous year, before he left for Venice, and Yeats had apparently found it charming. The men became close friends, although Yeats was older by 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DorothyPound.jpg|thumb|left|alt=photograph|upright|Pound met [[Dorothy Shakespear]] in 1909, and they were married in 1914.]]
Pound was also introduced to sculptor [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]], painter [[Wyndham Lewis]] and to the cream of London's literary circle, including the poet [[T. E. Hulme]]. The American heiress Margaret Lanier Cravens (1881–1912) became a patron; after knowing him a short time she offered a large annual sum to allow him to focus on his work. Cravens killed herself in 1912, after the pianist [[Walter Morse Rummel|Walter Rummel]], long the object of her affection, married someone else. She may also have been discouraged by Pound's engagement to Dorothy.&lt;ref&gt;For the money from Cravens, see Moody (2007), 124–125; for the speculation that they were lovers, see Carpenter (1988), 155; Dennis (1999), 264; Pound, Omar (1988), 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1909 the ''Personae'' collection became the first of Pound's works to have any commercial success. It was favorably reviewed; one review said it was "full of human passion and natural magic".&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 91; Elek, Jon. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=2841 "Personae"], ''The Literary Encyclopedia'', 8 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rupert Brooke]] was unimpressed, complaining that Pound had fallen under the influence of [[Walt Whitman]], writing in "unmetrical sprawling lengths".&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 93&lt;/ref&gt; In September a further 27 poems appeared as ''Exultations''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Peter. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5224 "Exultations"], ''The Literary Encyclopedia'', 20 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time Pound moved into new rooms at Church Walk, off [[Kensington High Street]], where he lived most of the time until 1914.&lt;ref name="Moody 2007, 180"&gt;Moody (2007), 180&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1910 Pound returned to the United States for eight months; his arrival coincided with the publication of his first book of literary criticism'', [[The Spirit of Romance]]'', based on his lecture notes at the polytechnic.&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 70, 81–89&lt;/ref&gt; His essays on the United States were written during this period, compiled as ''Patria Mia'' and not published until 1950. He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity, and he no longer felt at home there.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), 62–65&lt;/ref&gt; He found the [[New York Public Library]], then being built, especially offensive and, according to [[Paul L. Montgomery]], visited the architects' offices almost every day to shout at them.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;Montgomery, Paul L. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB091EF83A591A7493C0A9178AD95F468785F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22A%20Man%20of%20Contradictions%22%20Ezra%20Pound&amp;st=cse "Ezra Pound: A Man of Contradictions"], ''The New York Times'', 2 November 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound persuaded his parents to finance his passage back to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 59–62&lt;/ref&gt; It was nearly 30 years before he visited the United States again. On 22 February 1911 he sailed from New York on the [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|R.M.S. ''Mauretania'']], arriving in Southampton six days later.&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 95&lt;/ref&gt; After a few days in London he went to Paris, where he worked on a new collection of poetry, ''Canzoni'' (1911), panned by the ''Westminster Gazette'' as a "medley of pretension". When he returned to London in August 1911, [[Alfred Richard Orage|A. R. Orage]], editor of the socialist journal ''[[The New Age]],'' hired him to write a weekly column, giving him a steady income.&lt;ref&gt;Elek, Jon. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=6100 "Canzoni"], ''The Literary Encyclopedia'', 8 March 2005. Orage was referred to in ''The Cantos'' ([[Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|Possum]] refers to T. S. Eliot): "But the lot of 'em, / Yeats, Possum and Wyndham / had no ground beneath 'em. / Orage had." See Wilhelm (2008), 83, citing Canto 98/685.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagism===

[[File:Home of Ezra Pound, London.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|10 Church Walk, [[Kensington]]]]
Hilda Doolittle arrived in London from Philadelphia in May 1911 with the poet Frances Gregg and Gregg's mother; when they returned in September, Doolittle decided to stay on. Pound introduced her to his friends, including the poet [[Richard Aldington]], whom she would marry in 1913. Before that the three of them lived in Church Walk, Kensington—Pound at no. 10, Doolittle at no. 6, and Aldington at no. 8—and worked daily in the British Museum Reading Room.&lt;ref name="Moody 2007, 180"/&gt;

At the museum Pound met regularly with the curator and poet [[Laurence Binyon]], who introduced him to the East Asian artistic and literary concepts that inspired the imagery and technique of his later poetry. The museum's visitors' books show that Pound was often found during 1912 and 1913 in the Print Room examining Japanese [[ukiyo-e]], some inscribed with [[Waka (poetry)|Japanese ''waka'' verse]], a genre of poetry whose economy and strict conventions likely contributed to Imagist techniques of composition.&lt;ref&gt;Arrowsmith (2011), 103–164; also see Arrowsmith (2011), 27–42, 118, and Dennis (2000), 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Arrowsmith lecture"&gt;Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard (March 2012). [http://vimeo.com/arrowsmith/cosmopolitanism-and-modernism "Cosmopolitanism and Modernism"] (video of a lecture discussing the importance of Japanese culture to Pound's early poetry), [[London University School of Advanced Study]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was working at the time on the poems that became ''Ripostes'' (1912), trying to move away from his earlier work; he wrote that the "stilted language" of ''Canzoni'' had reduced Ford Madox Ford to rolling on the floor with laughter.&lt;ref&gt;Witemeyer (1961), 112.&lt;/ref&gt; He realized with his translation work that the problem lay not in his knowledge of the other languages, but in his use of English:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;What obfuscated me was not the Italian but the crust of dead English, the sediment present in my own available vocabulary&amp;nbsp;... You can't go round this sort of thing. It takes six or eight years to get educated in one's art, and another ten to get rid of that education.

Neither can anyone learn English, one can only learn a series of Englishes. Rossetti made his own language. I hadn't in 1910 made a language, I don't mean a language to use, but even a language to think in.&lt;ref&gt;Venuti (1979), 88; Knapp (1979), 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While living at Church Walk in 1912, Pound, Aldington and Doolittle started working on ideas about language. While in the British Museum tearoom one afternoon, they decided to begin a 'movement' in poetry, called Imagism. ''Imagisme'', Pound would write in ''Riposte'', is "concerned solely with ''language'' and ''presentation''".&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 180, 222&lt;/ref&gt; The aim was clarity: a fight against abstraction, romanticism, rhetoric, inversion of word order, and over-use of adjectives. They agreed on three principles:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;1. Direct treatment of the "thing" whether subjective or objective.&lt;br /&gt;
2. To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.&lt;br /&gt;
3. As regarding rhythm: to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome.&lt;ref name=Pound1918&gt;Pound, Ezra. "A Retrospect", in T. S. Eliot. (1968). ''Literary Essays of Ezra Pound''. New York: New Directions Publishing (first published 1918), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uOQMlH_zYNAC&amp;pg=PA3 3–5].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Superfluous words, particularly adjectives, should be avoided, as well as expressions like "dim lands of peace", which Pound thought dulled the image by mixing the abstract with the concrete. He wrote that the natural object was always the "adequate symbol". Poets should "go in fear of abstractions", and should not re-tell in mediocre verse what has already been told in good prose.&lt;ref name=Pound1918/&gt;

A typical example is Pound's "[[In a Station of the Metro]]" (1913), inspired by an experience on the [[Paris Métro|Paris Underground]], about which he wrote, "I got out of a train at, I think, [[Concorde (Paris Métro)|La Concorde]], and in the jostle I saw a beautiful face, and then, turning suddenly, another and another, and then a beautiful child's face, and then another beautiful face. All that day I tried to find words for what this made me feel." He worked on the poem for a year, reducing it to its essence in the style of a Japanese [[haiku]].&lt;ref&gt;Witemeyer (1969), 34; for its description as ''the'' classic Imagist poem, see Witemeyer (1999), 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other modernist artists of the period, Pound was inspired by Japanese art, but the aim was to re-make—or as Pound said, "make it new"—and blend cultural styles, instead of copying directly or slavishly. He may have been inspired by a [[Suzuki Harunobu]] print he almost certainly saw in the British Library (Richard Aldington mentions the specific prints he matched to verse), and probably attempted to write haiku-like verse during this period.&lt;ref name ="Arrowsmith lecture"/&gt;

===''Ripostes'' and translations===
''[[Ripostes]]'', published in October 1912, begins Pound's shift toward minimalist language. [[Michael J. Alexander|Michael Alexander]] describes the poems as showing a greater concentration of meaning and economy of rhythm than his earlier work.&lt;ref name=Alexander1979p62&gt;Alexander (1979), 62&lt;/ref&gt; It was published when Pound had just begun his move toward [[Imagism]]; his first use of the word ''Imagiste'' appears in his prefatory note to the volume.&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Ezra, ''Ripostes'', Stephen Swift &amp; Co Ltd, London, 1912; Pound (1918), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uOQMlH_zYNAC&amp;pg=PA4 4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For submission and publication dates, see Pound, Ezra. ''Poems and translations'', Library of America, (2003), 1239&lt;/ref&gt; The collection includes five poems by Hulme and a translation of the 8th-century [[Old English literature|Old English]] poem ''[[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]]'', although not a literal translation.&lt;ref&gt;For the original text of ''The Seafarer'', see [http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;type=text&amp;id=Sfr "The Seafarer"], Anglo-Saxons.net; for Pound's interpretation, see Pound, Ezra.

Alexander writes that in some circles, Pound's translations made him more unpopular than the treason charge, and the reaction to ''The Seafarer'' was a rehearsal for the negative response to ''Homage to Sextus Propertius'' in 1919.&lt;ref name=Alexander1979p62/&gt; His translation from the Italian of ''Sonnets and ballate of [[Guido Cavalcanti]]'' was also published in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Sieburth (2010), xv&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ezra Pound - Cathay Title Page 1915.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=book cover|In 1913 Pound was given [[Ernest Fenollosa]]'s unpublished notes, which led to ''[[Cathay (poetry collection)|Cathay]]'' (1915).]]

Pound was fascinated by the translations of [[Japanese poetry]] and [[Noh]] plays which he discovered in the papers of [[Ernest Fenollosa]], an American professor who had taught in Japan. Fenollosa had studied Chinese poetry under Japanese scholars; in 1913 his widow, Mary McNeil Fenollosa, decided to give his unpublished notes to Pound after seeing his work; she was looking for someone who cared about poetry rather than philology.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 239&lt;/ref&gt; Pound edited and published Fenellosa's ''The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry'' in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry: A Critical Edition'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The title page of the collection ''[[Cathay (poetry collection)|Cathay]]'' (1915), refers to the poet "Rihaku", the pronunciation in Japanese of the [[Tang dynasty]] Chinese poet, [[Li Bai]], whose poems were much beloved in China and Japan for their technical mastery and much translated in the West because of their seeming simplicity. Alexander thinks this is the most attractive  of Pound's work.&lt;ref name=Alexander95&gt;Alexander (1979), 95&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese critic [[Wai-lim Yip]] writes of it: "One can easily excommunicate Pound from the Forbidden City of Chinese studies, but it seems clear that in his dealings with ''Cathay,'' even when he is given only the barest details, he is able to get into the central concerns of the original author by what we may perhaps call a kind of clairvoyance."&lt;ref&gt;Yip, Wai-lim.  ''Ezra Pound's Cathay''. Princeton University Press, 1969, cited in Alexander (1979), 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound could not understand Chinese himself, yet some critics see his translations of Chinese poetry as among the best (others complain of their mistakes).&lt;ref name=Alexander95/&gt; ''Cathay'' was the first of many translations Pound would make from the Chinese. Pound often followed the translations made by [[Herbert Giles]] in his ''[[History of Chinese Literature]] '' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Orientalism, Modernism, and the American Poem | first = Robert |last = Kern | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-521-49613-1 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=uWeRGJW5sNwC&amp;pg=PA185 | pp= [https://books.google.com/books?id=kxK2RkkL_asC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Giles&amp;f=false 186–189]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used Fenollosa's work as a starting point for what he called the [[ideogrammic method]], which proceeded on Fenollosa's entirely mistaken but fruitful idea that each character represented an image or pictograph, based on sight rather than sound.&lt;ref&gt;"The Fenollosa Papers" in Stock (1965), 177–179&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Graves]] recalled "I once asked Arthur Waley how much Chinese Pound knew; Waley shook his head despondently."&lt;ref&gt;Graves, from "These Be Your Gods, O Israel" (138–139)&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Yao, scholar of American and Asian literature, sees ''Cathay'' as a "major feat"; a work where Pound shows that translation is possible without a thorough knowledge of the source language. Yao does not view Pound's lack of Chinese as an obstacle, and states that the poet's trawl through centuries of scholarly interpretations resulted in a genuine understanding of the original poem.&lt;ref&gt;Yao (2010), 36–39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage, ''Blast''===
[[File:William Butler Yeats 1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|[[W. B. Yeats]] invited Pound to spend the winter of 1913–1914 with him in Sussex.]]

In August 1912 [[Harriet Monroe]] hired Pound as a regular contributor to ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]''. He submitted his own poems, as well as poems by [[James Joyce]], [[Robert Frost]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], Yeats, H.D. and Aldington, and collected material for a 64-page anthology, ''Des Imagistes'' (1914). The Imagist movement began to attract attention from critics.&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 143–147; Tytell (1987), 97&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1913 Yeats, whose eyesight was failing, rented Stone Cottage in [[Coleman's Hatch]], Sussex, and invited Pound to accompany him as his secretary. They stayed there for 10 weeks, reading and writing, walking in the woods and fencing. It was the first of three winters they spent together at Stone Cottage, including two with Dorothy after she and Pound married on 20 April 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 240; Longenbach (1988); Longenbach, James. [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/10/books/the-odd-couple-pound-and-yeats-together.html "The Odd Couple: Pound and Yeats Together"], ''The New York Times'', 10 January 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage had proceeded despite opposition from her parents, who worried about Pound's meager income, earned from contributions to literary magazines and probably less than £300 a year. Dorothy's annual income was £50, aided by £150 from her family. Her parents eventually consented, perhaps out of fear that she was getting older with no other suitor in sight. Pound's concession to marry in church helped convince them. Afterward he and Dorothy moved into an apartment with no bathroom at 5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, with the newly wed Hilda (H.D.) and Richard Aldington living next door.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 246–249&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound wrote for Wyndham Lewis' literary magazine ''[[Blast (magazine)|Blast]],'' although only two issues were published. An advertisement in ''The Egoist'' promised it would cover "Cubism, Futurism, Imagisme and all Vital Forms of Modern Art". Pound took the opportunity to extend the definition of Imagisme to art, naming it [[Vorticism]]: "The image is a radiant node or cluster; it is&amp;nbsp;... a ''vortex'', from which, and through which, and into which, ideas are constantly rushing."&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 230, 256&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting to the magazine, the poet [[Lascelles Abercrombie]] called for the rejection of Imagism and a return to the traditionalism of [[William Wordsworth]]; Pound challenged him to a duel on the basis that "Stupidity carried beyond a certain point becomes a public menace".&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 159&lt;/ref&gt; Abercrombie suggested their choice of weapon be unsold copies of their own books.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;Campbell, James. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/17/poetry3 "Home from home"], ''The Guardian'', 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of ''Blast'' was celebrated at a dinner attended by New England poet [[Amy Lowell]], then in London to meet the Imagists. But Hilda and Richard were already moving away from Pound's understanding of the movement, as he aligned more with Wyndham Lewis's ideas. When Lowell agreed to finance an anthology of Imagist poets, Pound's work was not included. Upset at Lowell, he began to call ''Imagisme'' "Amygism", and in July 1914 he declared the movement dead and asked that the group not continue to call themselves Imagists. They dissented, not believing that the movement was Pound's invention, and Lowell eventually Anglicized the term.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 222–225&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I, disillusionment===
{{further|Lost Generation}}
[[File:T. S. Eliot by Lady Ottoline Morrell, 1923.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=photograph|[[T.S. Eliot]] in 1923. Pound persuaded ''Poetry'' to publish Eliot's "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]".]]
Between 1914 and 1916 Pound assisted in the serialisation of James Joyce's ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' in ''The Egoist'', then helped to have it published in book form. In 1915 he persuaded ''Poetry'' to publish [[T. S. Eliot]]'s "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]". Eliot had sent "Prufrock" to almost every editor in England, but was rejected. He eventually sent it to Pound, who instantly saw it as a work of genius and submitted it to ''Poetry''.&lt;ref name=Aiken&gt;Aiken (1965), 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; "[Eliot] has actually trained himself AND modernized himself ON HIS OWN", Pound wrote to Monroe in October 1914. "The rest of the promising young have done one or the other but never both. Most of the swine have done neither."&lt;ref&gt;Mertens, Richard. [http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0108/features/letter.html "Letter by letter"], ''University of Chicago Magazine'', April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication in 1915 of ''Cathay'', Pound mentioned he was working on a long poem, casting about for the correct form. He told a friend in August: "It is a huge, I was going to say, gamble, but shan't", and in September described it as a "cryselephantine poem of immeasurable length which will occupy me for the next four decades unless it becomes a bore". About a year later, in January 1917, he had the first three trial cantos, distilled to one, published as Canto I in ''Poetry''.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; He was now a regular contributor to three literary magazines. From 1917 he wrote music reviews for ''The New Age'' under the pen name William Atheling, and weekly pieces for ''The Egoist'' and ''[[The Little Review]]''; many of the latter were directed against provincialism and ignorance. The volume of writing exhausted him. He feared he was wasting his time writing outside poetry,&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 330, 334&lt;/ref&gt; exclaiming that he "''must'' stop writing so much prose".&lt;ref name="m342"&gt;Moody (2007), 342&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieratic Head of Ezra Pound 01 (brightened).jpg|thumb|upright|Pound commissioned this sculpture from [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] in 1913.]]
Pound was deeply affected by the war. He was devastated when Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, from whom he had commissioned a sculpture of himself two years earlier, was killed in the trenches in 1915. He published ''Gaudier-Brzeska: A Memoir'' the following year, in reaction to what he saw as an unnecessary loss.&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 174, 180–182&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1917 his depression worsened. He blamed American provincialism for the seizure of the October issue of ''The Little Review''.  The [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]] applied the [[Comstock Laws]] against an article Lewis wrote, describing it as lewd and indecent. Around the same time, Hulme was killed by shell-fire in Flanders, and Yeats married [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]].&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 334–335&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, after a bout of illness which was presumably the [[Spanish influenza]], Pound decided to stop writing for ''The Little Review'', mostly because of the volume of work. He asked the publisher for a raise to hire 23-year-old [[Iseult Gonne]] as a typist, causing rumors that Pound was having an affair with her, but he was turned down.&lt;ref name="m342" /&gt;

In 1919 he published a collection of his essays for ''The Little Review'' as ''Instigations'', and in the March 1919 issue ''Poetry,'' he published ''Poems from the Propertius Series'', which appeared to be a translation of the Latin Poet [[Sextus Propertius]]. When he included this in his next poetry collection in 1921, he had renamed it ''Homage to Sextus Propertius'' in response to criticism of his translation skills. "Propertius" is not a strict translation; biographer David Moody describes it as "the refraction of an ancient poet through a modern intelligence". Harriet Monroe, editor of ''Poetry'', published a letter from a professor of Latin, [[William Gardner Hale|W. G. Hale]], saying that Pound was "incredibly ignorant" of the language, and alluded to "about three-score errors" in ''Homage''. Monroe did not publish Pound's response, which began "Cat-piss and porcupines!!" and continued, "The thing is no more a translation than my 'Altaforte' is a translation, or than [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Fitzgerald]]'s [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Omar]] is a translation". Moore interpreted Pound's silence after that as his resignation as foreign editor.&lt;ref&gt;Kenner (1971), 286&lt;/ref&gt;

His poem ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' consists of 18 short parts, and describes a poet whose life has become sterile and meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Ezra. [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/23538/pg23538.html "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley"], Project Gutenberg, 18 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Published in June 1920, it marked his farewell to London. He was disgusted by the massive loss of life during the war and was unable to reconcile himself with it. Stephen J. Adams writes that, just as Eliot denied he was Prufrock, so Pound denied he was Mauberley, but the work can nevertheless be read as autobiographical. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene, before turning to social criticism, economics, and an attack on the causes of the war; here the word ''usury'' appears in his work for the first time. The critic [[F. R. Leavis]] saw the poem as Pound's major achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (2005), 149; Leavis (1932), 134, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war had shattered Pound's belief in modern western civilization. He saw the Vorticist movement as finished and doubted his own future as a poet. He had only the ''New Age'' to write for; his relationship with ''Poetry'' was finished, ''The Egoist'' was quickly running out of money because of censorship problems caused by the serialization of Joyce's ''Ulysses'', and the funds for ''The Little Review'' had dried up. Other magazines ignored his submissions or refused to review his work. Toward the end of 1920 he and Dorothy decided their time in London was over and resolved to move to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Moody (2007), 394–396&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New Age'' published Pound's ''Axiomata'' in January 1921, a statement of his views on consciousness and the universe: "the intimate essence of the universe is ''not'' of the same nature as our own consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Witemeyer (1969), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YN_FZn452n4C&amp;pg=PA25 25]; Orage (1921), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MOkS64ayYvgC&amp;pg=PA201 201]&lt;/ref&gt; Orage wrote in the same issue:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;Mr. Pound has shaken the dust of London from his feet with not too emphatic a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.&amp;nbsp;...

With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends&amp;nbsp;... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, as I have said, is not unusual&amp;nbsp;... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.&lt;ref&gt;Orage (1921), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MOkS64ayYvgC&amp;pg=PA199 199–200]; Stock (1970), 235; Moody (2007), 410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Olga Rudge advertisement.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|Pound met [[Olga Rudge]] in 1922.]]
The Pounds settled in Paris in January 1921, and several months later moved into an inexpensive apartment at 70 ''bis'' [[:fr:Rue Notre Dame des Champs|Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Pound became friendly with [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Fernand Léger]] and others of the [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movements, as well as [[Basil Bunting]], Ernest Hemingway and his wife, [[Hadley Richardson]].&lt;ref name="Meyers 1985 70 74"&gt;Meyers (1985), 70–74&lt;/ref&gt; He spent most of his time building furniture for his apartment and bookshelves for the bookstore [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]], and in 1921 the volume ''Poems 1918–1921'' was published. In 1922 Eliot sent him the manuscript of ''[[The Waste Land]]'', then arrived in Paris to edit it with Pound, who [[Blue pencil (editing)|blue-inked]] the manuscript with comments like "make up yr. mind&amp;nbsp;..." and "georgian".&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein (1999), 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot wrote: "I should like to think that the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared irrecoverably; yet, on the other hand, I should wish the blue pencilling on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound's critical genius."&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

In 1924 Pound secured funding for Ford Madox Ford's ''[[The Transatlantic Review]]'' from American attorney [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]]. The ''Review'' published works by Pound, Hemingway and [[Gertrude Stein]], as well as extracts from Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', before the money ran out in 1925. It also published several Pound music reviews, later collected into ''Antheil and the Treatise on Harmony''.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 430–431, 448&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway asked Pound to blue-ink his short stories. Although Hemingway was 14 years younger, the two forged a lifelong relationship of mutual respect and friendship, living on the same street for a time, and touring Italy together in 1923. "They liked each other personally, shared the same aesthetic aims, and admired each other's work", writes Hemingway biographer [[Jeffrey Meyers]], with Hemingway assuming the status of pupil to Pound's teaching. Pound introduced Hemingway to Lewis, Ford, and Joyce, while Hemingway in turn tried to teach Pound to box, but as he told [[Sherwood Anderson]], "[Ezra] habitually leads with his chin and has the general grace of a crayfish or crawfish".&lt;ref name="Meyers 1985 70 74"/&gt;

Pound was 36 when he met the 26-year-old American violinist [[Olga Rudge]] in Paris in late 1922, beginning a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer [[John Tytell]] believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had turned a blind eye to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress [[Natalie Barney]] in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]]. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy [[Youngstown, Ohio]], steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the [[Rive Droite|Right Bank]], socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 180; Wilhelm (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UpmBwzOT7hwC&amp;pg=PA251 251]&lt;/ref&gt; They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with [[George Antheil]] to apply the concept of [[Vorticism]] to music, and managed to write two operas, including ''Le Testament de Villon''. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.&lt;ref&gt;For his operas, see Kenner (1973), 390; for his pieces for violin, see Stock (1970), 252–256&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pounds were unhappy in Paris; Dorothy complained about the winters and Ezra's health was poor. At one dinner, a guest randomly tried to stab him; to Pound  this underlined that their time in France was over.&lt;ref name=Tytell191/&gt; Hemingway saw how Pound "indulged in a small nervous breakdown", leading to two days in an American hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (1981), 127&lt;/ref&gt; They decided to move to a quieter place, choosing [[Rapallo]], Italy, a town of 15,000. "Italy is my place for starting things", he told a friend.&lt;ref name=Tytell191&gt;Tytell (1987), 191–193&lt;/ref&gt; During this period they lived on Dorothy's income, supplemented by dividends from stock she had invested in.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 225&lt;/ref&gt;

Olga Rudge, pregnant with Pound's child, followed them to Italy. She had little interest in raising a child, but may have felt that having one would maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 she gave birth to their daughter, [[Mary de Rachewiltz|Mary]]. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 198&lt;/ref&gt;

When Pound told Dorothy about the birth, she separated from him for much of that year and the next.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=s3mw-IZom4sC&amp;pg=PA13 13–15]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1925, she left on an extended trip to Egypt. She was pregnant by her return in March.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 450–451&lt;/ref&gt; In June she and Pound left Rapallo for Paris for the premiere of ''[[Le Testament de Villon]]'', without mentioning the pregnancy to his friends or parents. In September, Hemingway drove Dorothy to the [[American Hospital of Paris]] for the birth of a son, [[Omar Pound]]. In a letter to his parents in October, Pound wrote, "next generation (male) arrived. Both D &amp; it appear to be doing well".&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), 452–453&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy gave the baby son to her mother, Olivia, who raised him in London until he was old enough to go to boarding school. When Dorothy went to England each summer to see Omar, Pound would spend the time with Olga, whose father had bought her a house in Venice. The arrangement meant his children were raised very differently. Mary had a single pair of shoes, and books about Jesus and the saints, while Omar was raised in Kensington as an English gentleman by his sophisticated grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;For the house in Venice, see Tytell (1987), 198, and Mamoli Zorzi (2007), 15, 23; for Mary's memoir, see de Rachewiltz (1971), 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 the literary magazine ''This Quarter'' dedicated its first issue to Pound, including tributes from Hemingway and Joyce. Pound published ''Cantos XVII–XIX'' in the winter editions. In March 1927 he launched his own literary magazine, ''The Exile'', but only four issues were published. It did well in the first year, with contributions from Hemingway, [[E. E. Cummings]], Basil Bunting, Yeats, William Carlos Williams and [[Robert McAlmon]];  some of the poorest work in the magazine were Pound's rambling editorials on [[Confucianism]] and or in praise of Lenin, according to biographer J. J. Wilhelm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s3mw-IZom4sC&amp;pg=PA22 Wilhelm (1994), 22–24]&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to work on Fenollosa's manuscripts, and in 1928 won ''[[The Dial]]'''s poetry award for his translation of the [[Confucian classic]] ''[[Great Learning]]'' (''Dà Xué'', transliterated as ''Ta Hio'').&lt;ref name=Nadelxxii&gt;Nadel (1999), xxi–xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; That year his parents Homer and Isabel visited him in Rapallo, seeing him for the first time since 1914. By then Homer had retired, so they decided to move to Rapallo themselves. They took a small house, Villa Raggio, on a hill above the town.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 215&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound began work on ''[[The Cantos]]'' in earnest after relocating to Italy. The poems concern good and evil, a descent into hell followed by redemption and paradise. Its hundreds of characters fall into three groupings: those who enjoy hell and stay there; those who experience a metamorphosis and want to leave; and a few who lead the rest to ''paradiso terrestre''. Its composition was difficult and involved several false starts, and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts, beginning again in 1922.&lt;ref name=Terrellvii&gt;Terrell (1980), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8uEqOrAnat0C&amp;pg=PR7 vii]&lt;/ref&gt; The first three appear in ''Poetry'' in June–August 1917. The ''Malatesta Cantos'' appeared in ''[[The Criterion]]'' in July 1923, and two further cantos were published in ''The Transatlantic Review'' in January 1924. Pound published 90 copies in Paris in 1925 of ''A Draft of XVI. Cantos of Ezra Pound for the Beginning of a Poem of some Length now first made into a Book''.&lt;ref&gt;Bush (1976), xiii–xv&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turn to fascism, World War II===
Pound came to believe that the cause of World War I was finance capitalism, which he called "[[usury]]", that the solution lay in [[C. H. Douglas]]'s idea of [[social credit]], and that [[fascism]] was the vehicle for reform. He had met Douglas in the ''New Age'' offices and had been impressed by his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Preda (2005), 90&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a series of lectures on economics, and made contact&lt;!--vague--&gt; with politicians in the United States to discuss education, interstate commerce and international affairs. Although Hemingway advised against it, on 30 January 1933 Pound met [[Benito Mussolini]]. Olga Rudge played for Mussolini and told him about Pound, who had earlier sent him a copy of ''Cantos XXX''. During the meeting Pound tried to present Mussolini with a digest of his economic ideas, but Mussolini brushed them aside, though he called the ''Cantos'' "''divertente''" (entertaining). The meeting was recorded in ''Canto XLI'': "'Ma questo' /  said the boss, 'è divertente.'" Pound said he had "never met anyone who seemed to ''get'' my ideas so quickly as the boss".&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 228–232&lt;/ref&gt;

When Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to organize the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar for the first time in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C., where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 250–253&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1939 he received an honorary doctorate from Hamilton College, and a week later returned to Italy from the States and began writing [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] material for Italian newspapers. He wrote to [[James Laughlin]] that Roosevelt represented Jewry, and signed the letter with "[[Heil Hitler]]". He started writing for ''Action'', a newspaper owned by the British fascist [[Sir Oswald Mosley]], arguing that the [[Third Reich]] was the "natural civilizer of Russia".&lt;ref name=Tytell254&gt;Tytell (1987), 254&lt;/ref&gt; After war broke out in September that year, he began a furious letter-writing campaign to the politicians he had petitioned six months earlier, arguing that the war was the result of an international banking conspiracy and that the United States should keep out of it.&lt;ref name=Tytell253&gt;Tytell (1987), 253–265&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Tytell writes that, by the 1940s, no American or English poet had been so active politically since [[William Blake]]. Pound wrote over a thousand letters a year during the 1930s and presented his ideas in hundreds of articles, as well as in ''The Cantos''. His greatest fear was an economic structure dependent on the armaments industry, where the profit motive would govern war and peace. He read [[George Santayana]] and ''The Law of Civilization and Decay'' by [[Brooks Adams]], finding confirmation of the danger of the capitalist and usurer becoming dominant. He wrote in ''[[The Japan Times]]'' that "Democracy is now currently defined in Europe as a 'country run by Jews,'" and told Sir Oswald Mosley's newspaper that the English were a slave race governed since Waterloo by the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].&lt;ref name=Tytell253/&gt;

Pound broadcast over Rome Radio, although the Italian government was at first reluctant, concerned that he might be a double agent. He told a friend: "It took me, I think it was, ''two'' years, insistence and wrangling etc., to ''get hold'' of their microphone."&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 260&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded over a hundred broadcasts criticizing the United States, Roosevelt, Roosevelt's family and the Jews, his poetry, economics and Chinese philosophy. The first was in January 1935, and by February 1940 he was broadcasting regularly; he traveled to Rome one week a month to pre-record the 10-minute broadcasts, for which he was paid around $17, and they were broadcast every three days. The broadcasts required the Italian government's approval, although he often changed the text in the studio. Tytell wrote that Pound's voice had assumed a "rasping, buzzing quality like the sound of a hornet stuck in a jar", that throughout the "disordered rhetoric of the talks he sustained the notes of chaos, hysteria, and exacerbated outrage". The politics apart, Pound needed the money; his father's pension payments had stopped—his father died in February 1942 in Rapallo—and Pound had his mother and Dorothy to look after.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 264–266&lt;/ref&gt;

The broadcasts were monitored by the United States [[Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service]] listening station at [[Princeton University]], and in July 1943 Pound was indicted ''in absentia'' for treason. He answered the charge by writing a letter to Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]], which Tytell describes as "long, reasoned, and temperate", defending his right to free speech.&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 268–270&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to broadcast and write under pseudonyms until April 1945, shortly before his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Gill (2005), 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

The war years threw Pound's domestic arrangements into disarray. Olga lost possession of her house in Venice and took a small house with Mary above Rapallo at Sant' Ambrogio.&lt;ref&gt;Gery (2010), 222&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 Pound and Dorothy were evicted from their apartment in Rapallo. His mother's apartment was too small, and the couple moved in with Olga. Mary, then 19 and finished with convent school, was quickly sent back to Gais in Switzerland, leaving Pound, as she would later write, "pent up with two women who loved him, whom he loved, and who coldly hated each other."&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 262&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound was in Rome early in September when [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy surrendered]]. He borrowed a pair of hiking boots and a knapsack and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked the rest of the way; he apparently traveled over 450 miles in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty and tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.{{efn|Stock (1970): "In a letter written in October 1966 Mrs Pound recalled the period in these words: 'E.P. was in Rome when it was taken and he walked out (in a pair of Degli Uberti's heavy boots, many years later restored to owner) along the only road going north not infested by troops—spent a night in the open and with some peasants—got to a junction where there was a train going north with a herd of the dismantled Italian army ...' In an article published in 1966 his daughter said that during the long journey he slept in farms, in dormitories, and in the open, receiving food from kindly women on the way. Altogether Pound travelled more than 450 miles, arriving at Gais, his daughter said, 'one late afternoon, exhausted, his feet all blisters'."&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 401; also see Tytell (1987), 264–273&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He returned home to Rapallo, where on 3 May 1945, four days after Mussolini was shot, armed [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] arrived at the house to find Pound alone. He stuffed a copy of Confucius and a Chinese dictionary in his pocket before he was taken to their headquarters in [[Chiavari]]. He was released shortly afterwards, then with Olga gave himself up to an American military post in the nearby town of [[Lavagna]].&lt;ref name = Sieburthix/&gt;

[[File:Toilet paper, Pisan Cantos.JPG|upright|left|thumb|alt=photograph|Sheet of toilet paper showing start of Canto LXXXIV, c. May 1945, suggesting Pound began it in the steel cage&lt;ref&gt;Sieburth (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TubCKx3F6UQC&amp;pg=PR36 xxxvi]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Pound was transferred to U.S. [[Counterintelligence Corps (United States Army)|Counter Intelligence Corps]] headquarters in Genoa, where he was interrogated by Frank L. Amprin, an FBI agent assigned by [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. Pound asked to send a cable to [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] to offer to help negotiate peace with Japan. He also asked to be allowed a final broadcast, a script called "Ashes of Europe Calling", in which he recommended peace with Japan, American management of Italy, the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, and leniency toward Germany. His requests were denied and the script was forwarded to Hoover.&lt;ref name = Sieburthix&gt;Sieburth (2003), ix–xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May, the day Germany surrendered, Pound told an American reporter, Ed Johnston, that Hitler was "a Jeanne d'Arc, a saint", and that Mussolini was an "imperfect character who lost his head".&lt;ref&gt;Sieburth Stock (1970), 408; Sieburth (2003b), xi&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May he was transferred to the United States Army Disciplinary Training Center north of Pisa, where he was placed in one of the camp's "death cells", a series of six-by-six-foot outdoor steel cages lit up at night by floodlights; engineers reinforced his cage with heavier steel for fear the fascists would try to break him out.&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), 408&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound spent three weeks in isolation in the heat, sleeping on the concrete, denied exercise and communication, except for conversations with the chaplain. After two and a half weeks he began to break down under the strain. [[Richard Sieburth]] wrote that Pound recorded it in ''Canto LXXX'', where [[Odysseus]] is saved from drowning by [[Leucothea]]: "hast'ou swum in a sea of air strip / through an aeon of nothingness, / when the raft broke and the waters went over me." Medical staff moved him out of the cage the following week. On 14 and 15 June he was examined by psychiatrists, one of whom found symptoms of a mental breakdown, after which he was transferred to his own tent and allowed reading material. He began to write, drafting what became known as ''[[The Cantos#LXXIV–LXXXIV (The Pisan Cantos)|The Pisan Cantos]]''.&lt;ref name = Sieburthix/&gt; The existence of a few sheets of toilet paper showing the beginning of ''Canto LXXIV'' suggests he started it while in the cage.&lt;ref name = "Kimpel470-474"/&gt;

[[File:Center building at Saint Elizabeths, National Photo Company, circa 1909-1932.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|[[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] (photographed c.&amp;nbsp;1909–1932)]]

On 15 November 1945 Pound was transferred to the United States. An escorting officer's impression was that "he is an intellectual 'crackpot' who imagined that he could correct all the economic ills of the world and who resented the fact that ordinary mortals were not sufficiently intelligent to understand his aims and motives".&lt;ref name = "Kimpel470-474"&gt;Kimpel (1981), 470–474&lt;/ref&gt; He was arraigned in Washington, D.C., on the 25th of that month on charges of treason. The charges included broadcasting for the enemy, attempting to persuade American citizens to undermine government support of the war, and strengthening morale in Italy against the United States.&lt;ref name=Tytell289/&gt;

He was admitted to [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]], and in June the following year Dorothy was declared his legal guardian. He was held for a time in the hospital's prison ward—Howard's Hall, known as the "hell-hole", a building without windows—in a room with a thick steel door and nine peepholes to allow the psychiatrists to observe him as they tried to agree on a diagnosis. Visitors were admitted for only 15 minutes at a time, while patients wandered around screaming and frothing at the mouth.&lt;ref name=Tytell289/&gt;

Pound's lawyer, [[Julien Cornell]], whose efforts to have him declared insane are credited with having saved him from life imprisonment, requested his release at a bail hearing in January 1947.&lt;ref&gt;For Cornell's efforts, see [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/07/obituaries/julien-cornell-83-the-defense-lawyer-in-ezra-pound-case.html "Julien Cornell, 83, The Defense Lawyer In Ezra Pound Case"], ''The New York Times'', 7 December 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital's superintendent, [[Winfred Overholser]], agreed instead to move him to the more pleasant surroundings of Chestnut Ward, close to Overholser's private quarters, which is where he spent the next 12 years.&lt;ref name=Tytell289/&gt; The historian [[Stanley Kutler]] was given access in the 1980s to military intelligence and other government documents about Pound, including his hospital records, and wrote that the psychiatrists believed Pound had a [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic personality]], but they considered him sane. Kutler believes that Overholser protected Pound from the criminal justice system because he was fascinated by him.&lt;ref&gt;Mitgang, Herbert. "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9A02E0DC1139F932A05753C1A967948260 Researchers dispute Ezra Pound's 'insanity']",  ''The New York Times'', 31 October 1981; also see Kutler, Stanley I. (1983). ''American Inquisition: Justice and Injustice in the Cold War''. Hill &amp; Wang.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tytell writes that Pound was in his element in Chestnut Ward. He was at last provided for, and was allowed to read, write and receive visitors, including Dorothy for several hours a day. He took over a small alcove with wicker chairs just outside his room, and turned it into his private living room, where he entertained his friends and important literary figures. He began work on his translation of [[Sophocles]]'s ''[[Women of Trachis]]'' and ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', and continued work on ''The Cantos''. It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released. Olga Rudge visited him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955, and was unable to convince him to be more assertive about his release. She wrote to a friend: "E.P. has—as he had before—bats in the belfry but it strikes me that he has fewer not more than before his incarceration."&lt;ref name=Tytell289&gt;Tytell (1987), 289–297, 304–305&lt;/ref&gt;

James Laughlin had "Cantos LXXIV–LXXXIV" ready for publication in 1946 under the title ''The Pisan Cantos'', and gave Pound an advance copy, but he held back, waiting for an appropriate time to publish. A group of Pound's friends—Eliot, Cummings, [[W. H. Auden]], Allen Tate, and Julien Cornell—met Laughlin to discuss how to get him released. They planned to have Pound awarded the first [[Bollingen Prize]], a new national poetry award by the Library of Congress, with $1,000 prize money donated by the [[Mellon family]].&lt;ref name=Tytell302/&gt;

The awards committee consisted of 15 fellows of the Library of Congress, including several of Pound's supporters, such as Eliot, Tate, Conrad Aiken, Amy Lowell, [[Katherine Anne Porter]] and [[Theodore Spencer]].{{efn|The Associated Press reported the list of judges as Conrad Aiken, W. H. Auden, Louise Bogan, Katherine Garrison Chapin, T. S. Eliot, Paul Green, Robert Lowell, Katherine Anne Porter, Karl Shapiro, Allen Tate, Willard Thorp and Robert Penn Warren. Also on the list were Leonie Adams, the Library of Congress's poetry consultant, and Theodore Spencer, who died on 18 January 1949, just before the award was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/02/20/84196391.pdf "Pound, in Mental Clinic, Wins Prize for Poetry Penned in Treason Cell"], Associated Press, 19 February 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The idea was that the Justice Department would be placed in an untenable position if Pound won a major award and was not released.&lt;ref name=Tytell302/&gt; Laughlin published ''The Pisan Cantos'' on 30 July 1948, and the following year the prize went to Pound.{{efn|"At their [the committee's first] meeting [in November 1948], and to no one's great surprise, given [Allen] Tate's behind-the-scenes maneuverings and the intimidating presence of recent Nobel Laureate T.

Pound responded to the award with "No comment from the bughouse."&lt;ref name=Tytell302&gt;Tytell (1987), 293, 302–303; Tytell cites MacLeish, Archibald. ''Riders on the Earth'', Houghton Mifflin, 1978, 120; Winnick, R. H. (ed.) ''Letters of Archibald MacLeish, 1907 to 1982''. Houghton Mifflin, 1983, and in particular a letter from MacLeish to Milton Eisenhower, which is in the Library of Congress. For more details of who supported and opposed, see McGuire (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

There was uproar. The ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' quoted critics who said "poetry [cannot] convert words into maggots that eat at human dignity and still be good poetry". [[Robert Hillyer]], a Pulitzer Prize winner and president of the Poetry Society of America, attacked the committee in ''The Saturday Review of Literature'', telling journalists that he "never saw anything to admire in Pound, not one line".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4eQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=imoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1394,1049824&amp;hl=en "Canto Controversy"] ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', 22 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hillyer, Robert.

Javits]] demanded an investigation into the awards committee. It was the last time the prize was administered by the Library of Congress.&lt;ref name=Tytell302/&gt;

===Views and relationships===
Although Pound repudiated his antisemitism in public, he maintained his views in private. He refused to talk to psychiatrists with Jewish-sounding names, dismissed people he disliked as "Jews", and urged visitors to read the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (1903), a forgery claiming to represent a Jewish plan for world domination.&lt;ref name=Tytell289/&gt; He struck up a friendship with the conspiracy theorist and antisemite [[Eustace Mullins]], believed to be associated with the Aryan League of America, and author of the 1961 biography ''This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound''.&lt;ref name="Wilhelm286"&gt;Wilhelm (1994), 286, 306&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more damaging was his friendship with [[John Kasper]], a far-right activist and [[Ku Klux Klan]] member. Kasper had come to admire Pound during literature classes at university, and after he wrote to Pound in 1950 the two had become friends. Kasper opened a bookstore in [[Greenwich Village]] in 1953 called "Make it New", reflecting his commitment to Pound's ideas; the store specialized in far-right material, including Nazi literature, and Pound's poetry and translations were displayed on the window front.&lt;ref name=Hickman127&gt;Hickman (2005), 127&lt;/ref&gt; Kasper and another follower of Pound's, David Horton, set up a publishing imprint, Square Dollar Series, which Pound used as a vehicle for his tracts about economic reform.&lt;ref name=Tytell306&gt;Tytell (1987), 306–308&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm writes that there were a lot of conventional people visiting Pound too, such as the classicist J.P. Sullivan and the writer [[Guy Davenport]], but it was the association with Mullins and Kasper that stood out and delayed his release from St Elizabeths.&lt;ref name=Wilhelm286/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tytell306/&gt;

===Release===
Pound's friends continued to try to get him out. Shortly after Hemingway won the [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1954, he told ''Time'' magazine that "this would be a good year to release poets".&lt;ref name = "Stock437"&gt;Stock (1970), 437&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Archibald MacLeish]] asked Hemingway in June 1957 to write a letter on Pound's behalf. Hemingway believed Pound was unable to abstain from awkward political statements or from friendships with people like Kasper, but he signed a letter of support anyway and pledged $1,500 to be given to Pound when he was released.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2000), 303&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for the ''Paris Review'' in early 1958, Hemingway said that Kasper should be jailed and Pound  released.&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway, Ernest.

Several publications began campaigning for Pound's release in 1957. ''Le Figaro'' published an appeal entitled "The Lunatic at St Elizabeths". ''The New Republic'', ''Esquire'' and ''The Nation'' followed suit; ''The Nation'' argued that Pound was a sick and vicious old man, but had rights. In 1958 MacLeish hired [[Thurman Arnold]], a prestigious lawyer who ended up charging no fee, to file a motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment. Overholser, the hospital's superintendent, supported the application with an affidavit saying Pound was permanently and incurably insane, and that confinement served no therapeutic purpose.&lt;ref name=LewisNYT&gt;Lewis, Anthony.

The Department of Justice did not oppose the motion, and Pound was free.&lt;ref name=Tytell325&gt;Tytell (1987), 325–326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thurman |last= Arnold |title= Fair Fights and Foul: A Dissenting Lawyer's Life |publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc. |year=1965|place=New York|pages=236–242 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy (1958–1972)==
Pound arrived in Naples in July 1958, where he was photographed giving a [[Roman salute#Italy|fascist salute]] to the waiting press. When asked when he had been released from the mental hospital, he replied: "I never was. When I left the hospital I was still in America, and all America is an insane asylum."&lt;ref name="NYT58"&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0E12FF3C5F117B93C2A8178CD85F4C8585F9 "Pound, in Italy, Gives Fascist Salute; Calls United States an 'Insane Asylum'"], ''The New York Times'', 10 July 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; He and Dorothy went to live with Mary at [[Schloss Brunnenburg]], near [[Merano]] in the Province of [[South Tyrol]], where he met his grandson, Walter, and his granddaughter, Patrizia, for the first time, then returned to Rapallo, where Olga Rudge was waiting to join them.&lt;ref name=Tytell328/&gt;

They were accompanied by a teacher Pound had met in hospital, Marcella Spann, 40 years his junior, ostensibly acting as his secretary and collecting poems for an anthology. The four women soon fell out, vying for control over him; ''Canto CXIII'': alluded to it: "Pride, jealousy and possessiveness / 3 pains of hell." Pound was in love with Spann, seeing in her his last chance for love and youth. He wrote about her in ''Canto CXIII'': "The long flank, the firm breast / and to know beauty and death and despair / And to think that what has been shall be, / flowing, ever unstill." Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Spann was seen off, sent back to the United States.&lt;ref name=Tytell328&gt;Tytell (1987), 328–332; for the reference to "Canto 113", see Sieburth (2003), xl&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 1959, Pound was mired in depression. He saw his work as worthless and ''The Cantos'' botched. In a 1960 interview given in Rome to [[Donald Hall]] for ''Paris Review'', he said: "You—find me—in fragments." Hall wrote that he seemed in an "abject despair, [[Acedia|accidie]], meaninglessness, [[Aboulia|abulia]], waste". He paced up and down during the three days it took to complete the interview, never finishing a sentence, bursting with energy one minute, then suddenly sagging, and at one point seemed about to collapse. Hall said it was clear that he "doubted the value of everything he had done in his life".&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 347; Hall, Donald. [http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4598/the-art-of-poetry-no-5-ezra-pound "Ezra Pound, The Art of Poetry No. 5"], ''The Paris Review'', 28, Summer–Fall 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those close to him thought he was suffering from dementia, and in mid-1960, Mary placed him in a clinic near Merano when his weight dropped. He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga in Rapallo, then Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. Pound attended a neo-Fascist May Day parade in 1962, but his health continued to decline. The following year he told an interviewer, Grazia Levi: "I spoil everything I touch. I have always blundered&amp;nbsp;... All my life I believed I knew nothing, yes, knew nothing. And so words became devoid of meaning."&lt;ref name=Tytell333&gt;Tytell (1987), 333–336&lt;/ref&gt;

William Carlos Williams died in 1963, followed by Eliot in 1965. Pound went to Eliot's funeral in London and on to Dublin to visit Yeats's widow. Two years later he went to New York where he attended the opening of an exhibition featuring his blue-inked version of Eliot's ''The Waste Land''.&lt;ref name = "Nadel18"&gt;Nadel (2007), 18&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to Hamilton College where he received a standing ovation.&lt;ref name=Tytell337/&gt;

[[File:poundgrave.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|Pound's grave on the [[Isola di San Michele]]]]
Shortly before his death in 1972 it was proposed that he be awarded the [[Emerson-Thoreau Medal]] of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, but after a storm of protest the academy's council opposed it by 13 to 9. The sociologist [[Daniel Bell]], who was on the committee, argued that it was important to distinguish between those who explore hate and those who approve it. Two weeks before he died, Pound read for a gathering of friends at a café: "re ''usury''/ I was out of focus, taking a symptom for a cause. / The cause is ''avarice''."&lt;ref name=Tytell337&gt;Tytell (1987), 337–339&lt;/ref&gt;

On his 87th birthday, 30 October 1972, he was too weak to leave his bedroom. The next night he was admitted to the Civil Hospital of Venice, where he died in his sleep of an [[intestinal blockage]] on 1 November, with Olga at his side. Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral. Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed the body to the island cemetery, [[Isola di San Michele]], where he was buried near [[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Tytell (1987), 339; [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/11/02/79477128.pdf "Ezra Pound Dies in Venice at Age of 87"], ''The New York Times'', 2 November 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy died in England the following year. Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound.&lt;ref name = "Nadel18"/&gt;

==Style==
Critics generally agree that Pound was a strong yet subtle lyricist, particularly in his early work, such as "The River Merchant's Wife".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor (1963), 7, 19&lt;/ref&gt; According to Witmeyer a modern style is evident as early as ''Ripostes'', and Nadel sees evidence of modernism even before he began ''The Cantos'', writing that Pound wanted his poetry to represent an "objective presentation of material which he believed could stand on its own" without use of symbolism or romanticism.&lt;ref name=Nadel19991&gt;Nadel (1999), 1–6; Witmeyer (1999), 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on literature from a variety of disciplines, Pound intentionally layered often confusing juxtapositions, yet led the reader to an intended conclusion, believing the "thoughtful man" would apply a sense of organization and uncover the underlying symbolism and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Coats (2009), 87–89&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring Victorian and Edwardian grammar and structure, he created a unique form of speech, employing odd and strange words, jargon, avoiding verbs, and using rhetorical devices such as [[parataxis]].&lt;ref&gt;Stark (2001) 10–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound's relationship to music is essential to his poetry. Although he was tone deaf and his speaking voice is described as "raucous, nasal, scratchy", Michael Ingam writes that Pound is on a short list of poets possessed of a sense of sound, an "ear" for words, imbuing his poetry with [[Ezra Pound's Three Kinds of Poetry|melopoeia]].&lt;ref name = "Ingham236"/&gt; His study of troubadour poetry—words written to be sung (''motz et son'')—led him to think modern poetry should be written similarly.&lt;ref name = "Ingham236"&gt;Ingham (1999), 236–237&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that rhythm is "the hardest quality of a man's style to counterfeit".&lt;ref&gt;Pound (1968), 103&lt;/ref&gt; Ingham compares the form of ''The Cantos'' to a [[fugue]]; without adhering strictly to the traditions of the form, nevertheless multiple themes are explored simultaneously. He goes on to write that Pound's use of [[counterpoint]] is integral to the structure and cohesion of ''The Cantos'', which show multi-voiced counterpoint and, with the juxtaposition of images, non-linear themes. The pieces are presented in fragments "which taken together, can be seen to unfold in time as music does".&lt;ref&gt;Ingham (1999), 244–245&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagism and Vorticism===
[[File:EzraPound Ripostes.png|thumb|upright|alt=cover|[[Dorothy Shakespear]] designed the Vorticism-inspired [[cover art]] for Pound's 1915 ''Ripostes''.]]

Opinion varies about the nature of Pound's writing style. Nadel writes that imagism was to change Pound's poetry.&lt;ref name=Nadel19991/&gt; Like Wyndham Lewis, Pound reacted against decorative flourishes found in Edwardian writing, saying poetry required a precise and economic use of language and that the poet should always use the "exact" word, stripping the writing down to the "barest essence".&lt;ref&gt;Oliver (2011), 87&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nadel, "Imagism evolved as a reaction against abstraction&amp;nbsp;... replacing Victorian generalities with the clarity in Japanese haiku and ancient Greek lyrics."&lt;ref name=Nadel19991/&gt; Daniel Albright writes that Pound tried to condense and eliminate "all but the hardest kernel" from a poem, such as in the two-line poem "In a Station of the Metro".&lt;ref name = "Albright60"/&gt; However, Pound learned that Imagism did not lend itself well to the writing of an epic, so he turned to the more dynamic structure of Vorticism for ''The Cantos''.&lt;ref name = "Albright60"&gt;Albright (1999), 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translations===
Pound's translations represent a substantial part of his work. He began his career with translations of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ballads and ended with translations of Egyptian poetry. Yao says the body of translations by modernist poets in general, much of which Pound started, consists of some the most "significant modernist achievements in English".&lt;ref&gt;Yao (2010), 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; Pound was the first English language poet since [[John Dryden]], some three centuries earlier, to give primacy to translations in English literature. The fullness of the achievement for the modernists is that they renewed interest in multiculturalism, multilingualism, and, perhaps of greater importance, they treated translations not in a strict sense of the word but instead saw a translation as the creation of an original work.&lt;ref&gt;Yao (2010), 33–36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael J. Alexander|Michael Alexander]] writes that, as a translator, Pound was a pioneer with a great gift of language and an incisive intelligence. He helped popularize major poets such as [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and [[Du Fu]], and brought [[Occitan language|Provençal]] and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences. He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama. He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and helped keep them alive at a time when poets no longer considered translations central to their craft.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1997), 23–30&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pound's Fenollosa translations, unlike previous American translators of Chinese poetry, which tended to work with strict [[metre (poetry)|metrical]] and [[stanza]]ic patterns, Pound created [[free verse]] translations. Whether the poems are valuable as translations continues to be a source of controversy.&lt;ref name=Xie1999/&gt;  [[Hugh Kenner]] contends that ''Cathay'' should be read primarily as a work about World War I, not as an attempt at accurately translating ancient Eastern poems. The real achievement of the book, Kenner argues, is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship with an effort to "rethink the nature of an English poem". These ostensible translations of ancient Eastern texts, Kenner argues, are actually experiments in English poetics and compelling elegies for a warring West.&lt;ref name=Kenner199&gt;Kenner (1971), 199&lt;/ref&gt; Pound scholar Ming Xie explains that Pound's use of language in his translation of "The Seafarer" is deliberate, in that he avoids merely "trying to assimilate the original into contemporary language".&lt;ref name=Xie1999&gt;Xie (1999), 204–212&lt;/ref&gt;

Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea, and
We set up mast and sail on that swart ship,
Bore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also
Heavy with weeping, and winds from sternward
Bore us out onward with bellying canvas,
Circe's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.
Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller,
Thus with stretched sail, we went over sea til day's end.&lt;/poem&gt;
 |source=— Canto I (1917)}}
''The Cantos'' is difficult to decipher. In the epic poem, Pound disregards literary genres, mixing satire, hymns, [[Elegy|elegies]], essays and memoirs.&lt;ref name= "Nadel1-6"&gt;Nadel (1999), 1–6&lt;/ref&gt; Pound scholar Rebecca Beasley believes it amounts to a rejection of the 19th-century nationalistic approach in favor of early-20th-century [[comparative literature]]. Pound reaches across cultures and time periods, assembling and juxtaposing "themes and history" from [[Homer]] to [[Ovid]] and [[Dante]], from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]], and many others. The work presents a multitude of protagonists as "travellers between nations". The nature of ''The Cantos'', she says, is to compare and measure among historical periods and cultures and against "a Poundian standard" of modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley (2010), 662&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound layered ideas, cultures and historical periods, writing in as many as 15 different languages, using modern [[vernacular]], Classical languages and Chinese ideograms.&lt;ref&gt;Xie (1999), 217&lt;/ref&gt; Ira Nadel says ''The Cantos'' is an [[Epic poetry|epic]], that is "a poem including history", and that the "historical figures lend referentiality to the text". It functions as a contemporary memoir, in which "personal history [and] lyrical retrospection mingle"—most clearly represented in the ''Pisan Cantos''.&lt;ref name ="Nadel1-6"/&gt; Michael Ingham sees in ''The Cantos'' an American tradition of experimental literature, writing about it,  "These works include everything but the kitchen sink, and then add the kitchen sink".&lt;ref&gt;Ingham (1999), 240&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s William O'Connor described ''The Cantos'' as filled with "cryptic and gnomic utterances, dirty jokes, obscenities of various sorts".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor (1963), 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allen Tate]] believes the poem is not about anything and is without beginning, middle or end. He argues that Pound was incapable of sustained thought and "at the mercy of random flights of 'angelic insight,' an [[Icarians|Icarian]] self-indulgence of prejudice which is not checked by a total view to which it could be subordinated".&lt;ref&gt;Tate (1965), 87&lt;/ref&gt; This perceived lack of logical consistency or form is a common criticism of ''The Cantos''.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (1999), 8&lt;/ref&gt; Pound himself felt this absence of form was his great failure, and regretted that he could not "make it cohere".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls (1999), 144&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary criticism and economic theory===
Pound's literary criticism and essays are, according to [[Massimo Bacigalupo]], a "form of intellectual journal". In early works, such as ''The Spirit of Romance'' and "I Gather the Limbs of Osiris", Pound paid attention to medieval [[troubadour]] poets—[[Arnaut Daniel]] and [[François Villon]]. The former piece was to "remain one of Pound's principal sourcebooks for his poetry"; in the latter he introduces the concept of "luminous details".&lt;ref&gt;Bacigalupo (1999), 188–191&lt;/ref&gt; The [[leitmotif]]s in Pound's literary criticism are recurrent patterns found in historical events, which, he believed, through the use of judicious juxtapositions illuminate truth; and in them he reveals forgotten writers and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Bacigalupo (1999), 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound wrote intensively about economic theory with the ''ABC of Economics'' and ''Jefferson and/or Mussolini'', published in the mid-1930s right after he was introduced to Mussolini. These were followed by ''The Guide to Kulchur'', covering 2500 years of history, which [[Tim Redman]] describes as the "most complete synthesis of Pound's political and economic thought".&lt;ref&gt;Redman (1999), 258&lt;/ref&gt; Pound thought writing the cantos meant writing an epic about history and economics, and he wove his economic theories throughout; neither can be understood without the other.&lt;ref&gt;Redman (1999), 255–260&lt;/ref&gt; In these pamphlets and in ''[[The ABC of Reading]]'', he sought to emphasize the value of art and to "aestheticize the political", written forcefully, according to Nadel, and in a "determined voice".&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (1999), 10&lt;/ref&gt; In form his criticism and essays are direct, repetitive and reductionist, his rhetoric minimalist, filled with "strident impatience", according to Pound scholar Jason Coats, and frequently failing to make a coherent claim. He rejected traditional rhetoric and created his own, although not very successfully, in Coats's view.&lt;ref&gt;Bacigalupo (1999), 203; Coats (2009), 80, 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
In 1922, the literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]] reviewed Pound's latest published volume of poetry, ''Poems 1918–21'', and took the opportunity to provide an overview of his estimation of Pound as poet. In his essay on Pound, titled "Ezra Pound's Patchwork", Wilson wrote:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;Ezra Pound is really at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It is true that he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could scarcely have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.&amp;nbsp;... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=Wilson1922&gt;Wilson, Edmund (2007). "Ezra Pound's Patchwork", ''Literary Essays and Reviews of the 1920s &amp; 30s''. Library of America, 44, 45; the essay was first published on 19 April 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Wilson, the lines in Pound's poems stood isolated, with fragmentary wording contributing to poems that "do not hang together". Citing Pound's first seven cantos, Wilson dubbed the writing "unsatisfactory". He found ''The Cantos'' disjointed and its contents reflecting a too-obvious reliance on the literary works of other authors, and an awkward use of Latin and Chinese translations as a device inserted among reminiscences of Pound's own life.&lt;ref name=Wilson1922/&gt;

The rise of [[New Criticism]] during the 1950s, in which author is separated from text, secured Pound's poetic reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley (2010), 651&lt;/ref&gt; Nadel writes that the publication of T.S. Eliot's ''Literary Essays'' in 1954 "initiated the recuperation of Ezra Pound". Eliot's essays coincided with the work of [[Hugh Kenner]], who visited Pound extensively at St. Elizabeths.&lt;ref name= "Nadel12"&gt;Nadel (1999), 12&lt;/ref&gt; Kenner wrote that there was no great contemporary writer less read than Pound, adding that there is also no one to appeal more through "sheer beauty of language".&lt;ref&gt;Kenner (1983), 16&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Donald Davie]], Kenner brought a new appreciation to Pound's work in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1997), 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Gallup's Pound bibliography was published in 1963 and Kenner's ''[[The Pound Era]]'' in 1971.&lt;ref name= "Nadel12"/&gt; In the 1970s a literary journal dedicated to Pound studies (''Paideuma'') was established, and Ronald Bush published the first dedicated critical study of ''The Cantos'', to be followed by a number of research editions of ''The Cantos''.&lt;ref name= "Nadel12"/&gt;

Following Mullins' biography, described by Nadel as "partisan" and "melodramatic", was Noel Stock's factual 1970 ''Life of Ezra Pound'', although the material included was subject to Dorothy's approval. The 1980s saw three significant biographies: [[John Tytell]]'s "neutral" account in 1987, followed by Wilhelm's multi-volume biography. [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s sprawling narrative, a "complete life", built on what Stock began; unlike Stock, Carpenter had the benefit of working without intervention from Pound's relatives. In 2007 David Moody published the first of his multi-volume biography, combining narrative with literary criticism, the first work to link the two.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (2010b), 162–165&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Mary de Rachewiltz released the first dual-language edition of ''The Cantos'', including "Canto LXXII" and "Canto LXXIII".&lt;ref name= "Nadel13"/&gt; These cantos had originally been published in fascist magazines, and are characterized by 21st-century literary scholars as no more than war-time propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2012), 94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 a complete facsimile edition of Pound's prose and poetry was published, now considered a "fundamental research tool", according to Nadel.&lt;ref name= "Nadel13"&gt;Nadel (1999), 13&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarship in the 1990s turned toward in-depth investigations of his antisemitism and Rome years. Tim Redman writes about Pound's fascism and his relationship with Mussolini, and Leon Surrette about Pound's economic theories, especially during the Italian period, investigating how Pound the poet became Pound the fascist.&lt;ref&gt;Coats (2009), 81&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 Surrette wrote about the state of Pound criticism, that "the effort to uncover coherence in a&amp;nbsp;... crazy quilt of verse styles, critical principles, crankish economic theories and distasteful political affiliations has made it difficult to perceive the genesis and development of any of these components". He emphasized that Pound's "economic and political opinions have not been properly dated, nor has the suddenness of his radicalization been appreciated".&lt;ref&gt;Surrette (1999) 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadel's 2010 ''Pound in Context'' is a contextual literary approach to Pound scholarship. Pound's life, "the social, political, historical, and literary developments of his period", is fully investigated, which, according to Nadel is "the grid for reading Pound's poetry".&lt;ref&gt;Nadel (2010a), 1–6&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Matthew Feldman wrote that the more than 1,500 documents in the "Pound files" held by the FBI have been ignored by scholars, and almost certainly contain evidence that "Pound was politically cannier, was more bureaucratically involved with Italian Fascism, and was more involved with Mussolini's regime than has been posited".&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2012), 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Pound helped advance the careers of some of the best-known modernist writers of the early 20th century. In addition to Eliot, Joyce, Lewis, Frost, Williams, Hemingway and [[Conrad Aiken]], he befriended and helped [[Marianne Moore]], [[Louis Zukofsky]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Basil Bunting]], [[E. E. Cummings]], [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]], [[George Oppen]] and [[Charles Olson]].&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein (1999), 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Witemeyer argues that the Imagist movement was the most important in 20th-century English-language poetry because it affected all the leading poets of Pound's generation and the two generations after him.&lt;ref&gt;Witemeyer (1999), 48&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, [[Carl Sandburg]] wrote in ''Poetry'': "All talk on modern poetry, by people who know, ends with dragging in Ezra Pound somewhere. He may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker, poseur, trifler and vagrant. Or he may be classed as filling a niche today like that of Keats in a preceding epoch. The point is, he will be mentioned."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot (1917), 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Pound strongly influenced  the two significant modernising poets in the [[Irish Language]] in the mid-twentieth century, [[Seán Ó Ríordáin]] and [[Máirtín Ó Direáin]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien (1978), 205&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

The outrage after Pound's wartime collaboration with Mussolini's regime was so deep that the imagined method of his execution dominated the discussion. [[Arthur Miller]] considered him worse than Hitler: "In his wildest moments of human vilification Hitler never approached our Ezra&amp;nbsp;... he knew all America's weaknesses and he played them as expertly as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] ever did." The response went so far as to denounce all modernists as fascists, and it was only in the 1980s that critics began a re-evaluation. [[Macha Rosenthal]] wrote that it was "as if all the beautiful vitality and all the brilliant rottenness of our heritage in its luxuriant variety were both at once made manifest" in Ezra Pound.&lt;ref&gt;For Arthur Miller's quote, see Torrey (1984), 200. For Rosenthal, see her ''A Primer of Ezra Pound''. Macmillan, 1960, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound's antisemitism has soured evaluation of his poetry. Pound scholar Wendy Stallard Flory writes that separating the poetry from the antisemitism is perceived as apologetic. She believes the positioning of Pound as "National Monster" and "designated fascist intellectual" made him a stand-in for the silent majority in Germany, occupied France and Belgium, as well as Britain and the United States, who, she argues, made the [[Holocaust]] possible by aiding or standing by.&lt;ref&gt;Flory (1999), 285–286, 294–300&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in his life, Pound analyzed what he judged to be his own failings as a writer attributable to his adherence to ideological fallacies.&lt;ref name ="Carpenter898ff"/&gt; [[Allen Ginsberg]] states that, in a private conversation in 1967, Pound told the young poet, "my poems don't make sense." He went on to say that he "was not a lunatic, but a moron", and to characterize his writing as "stupid and ignorant", "a mess". Ginsberg reassured Pound that he "had shown us the way", but Pound refused to be mollified:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;'Any good I've done has been spoiled by bad intentions—the preoccupation with irrelevant and stupid things,' [he] replied. Then very slowly, with emphasis, surely conscious of Ginsberg's being Jewish: 'But the worst mistake I made was that stupid, suburban prejudice of anti-semitism.'&lt;ref name ="Carpenter898ff"&gt;Carpenter (1988), 898–899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Fbi index form1.png|right|thumb|upright|Notable American singer [[Paul Robeson]]'s index card update form from the 1970s]]
The '''FBI Indexes''' are a system used to track American citizens and other people by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) before the adoption by the FBI of computerized databases. The name signifies that the lists were originally made on paper index cards, compiled by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] before he became director of the FBI.&lt;ref&gt; name="Gentry, Curt 1992"&gt;Gentry, Curt.  J. Edgar Hoover: The Man and the Secrets. NY: Penguin Group, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The Index List was used to track U.S. citizens and others believed by the FBI to be dangerous to [[national security]], and was subdivided into various divisions which generally were rated based on different classes of danger the subject was thought to represent. There is no indication the FBI stopped adding names onto its Index List before September 11, 2001.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

After September 11, 2001, the date which the FBI folded its Index List into the [[Terrorist Screening Database]] (TSDB) is unknown, while the FBI consolidates the TSDB from other lists and manages its information. The TSDB is currently available to all U.S. national security agencies, while select information contained on the TSDB is forwarded to other nation states and international security agencies.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

== General Intelligence Division ==
Around the time of [[World War I]] and the [[First Red Scare]], [[William J. Flynn]] of the Bureau of Investigation had [[J. Edgar Hoover]]{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} set up a General Intelligence Division (GID). Hoover used his experience working as a [[librarian|library clerk]] at the National Archives to set up the system using extensive [[cross-referencing]].

The GID took files from the Bureau of Investigations (later renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation) and 'systematized' them via index cards; according to Walker and contrary to evidence, the cards covered 200,000 people.&lt;ref name=walker1/&gt; But by 1939, Hoover had more than 10 million people 'Indexed' in the FBI's domestic file system.&lt;ref name="Gentry, Curt 1992"&gt;Gentry, Curt.  J. Edgar Hoover: The Man and the Secrets. NY: Penguin Group, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the GID was shut down in 1924 after objections from people such as [[William J. Donovan]] who called into question its constitutionality,&lt;ref name=riebling1/&gt; Hoover and the FBI continued to expand the Index system for use by the agency, by Hoover, and by Hoover's political associates well into the 1970s. Today, the Index files covering untold numbers of Americans are still accessible by the FBI and its 29 field offices.

Titles to numerous Index catalogs include:&lt;ref name="Gentry, Curt 1992"/&gt; The Reserve Index, for influential people to be "arrested and held" in case of a national emergency; The Custodial Index, which included 110,000 Japanese Americans that were held in internment prison camps during World War II; The Sexual Deviant Index; The Agitator Index; The Communist Index; and The Administrative Index, which compiled several other earlier indexes.

Even though a complete list of Index titles is currently unavailable, Hoover and the FBI used their Index system to catalog Native American and African American liberation movements during the 1960s and 1970s, as well as Vietnam War protesters and other college students.

== Custodial Detention Index ==
The '''Custodial Detention Index''' ('''CDI'''), or '''Custodial Detention List''' was formed in 1939–1941, in the frame of a program called variously the "Custodial Detention Program" or "Alien Enemy Control".

J. Edgar Hoover described it as having come from his resurrected General Intelligence Division in Washington. According to Hoover, it created large numbers of files on "individuals, groups, and organizations engaged in subversive activities", including espionage, and enabled the Bureau to immediately identify potential threats.&lt;ref name=gentry1/&gt; Congressmen [[Vito Marcantonio]] called it "terror by index cards". Senator [[George W. Norris]] complained as well.&lt;ref name=gentry1/&gt;

The Custodial Detention Index was a list of suspects and potential subversives, classified as "A", "B" and "C"; the ones classified as "A" were destined to be immediately arrested and interned at the outbreak of war. Category A were leaders of Axis-related organizations, category B were members deemed "less dangerous" and category C were sympathizers. The actual assignment of the categories was, however, based on the perceived individual commitment to the person's native country, rather than the actual potential to cause harm; leaders of cultural organizations could be classified as "A".

The program involved creation of individual dossiers from secretly obtained information, including unsubstantiated data and in some cases, even hearsay and unsolicited phone tips, and information acquired without judicial warrants by [[mail cover]]s and [[postal interception|interception of mail]], [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]]s and covert searches. While the program targeted primarily Japanese, Italian, and German "[[enemy alien]]s", it also included some native-born American citizens. The program was run without Congress-approved legal authority, with no [[judicial oversight]] and outside of the official legal boundaries of the FBI. A person against which an accusation was made was investigated and eventually placed on the index; it was not removed until the person died. Getting on the list was easy; getting off of it was virtually impossible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031128111253/http://www.uvm.edu/~apreston/Taken_Into_Custody.html Taken Into Custody: the Internment of German and Italian Americans during World War II]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the press releases at the beginning of the war, one of the purposes of the program was to demonstrate the diligence and vigilance of the government by following, arresting and isolating a previously identified group of people with allegedly documented sympathies for [[Axis powers]] and potential for [[espionage]] or [[fifth column]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longwood.k12.ny.us/history/upton/pow1.htm Sketches Drawn of POW Tent at Camp Upton]&lt;/ref&gt; The list was later used for [[Japanese American internment]] after Roosevelt's [[Executive Order 9066]].{{fact|date=October 2018}} Although some say Hoover actually opposed those measures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asian-nation.org/internment.shtml Internerment], asian-nation.org, Dr. C.N. Le&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover and the FBI created the list from which 110,000 people were interned, 70,000 of which were American-born.

[[Attorney general|Attorney General]] [[Francis Biddle]], when he found out about the Index, labeled it "dangerous, illegal" and ordered its end. However, [[J. Edgar Hoover]] simply renamed it the Security Index,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2002/4/2002_4_30.shtml “THE MOST DANGEROUS INSTITUTION”]&lt;/ref&gt; and told his people not to mention it.

== Reserve Index/Security Index ==

The Security Index pertained to the FBI list of dangerous individuals who might commit acts inimical to the national defense and public safety of the United States in time of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indispensable Zinn: The Essential Writings of the "People's Historian"|last=Zinn|first=Howard|publisher=The New Press|year=2012|isbn=9781595586223|location=New York|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list also included those who could be arrested upon the order of a U.S. President invoking the Emergency Detention Program. The Reserve Index, on the other hand, listed all left-wingers and individuals suspected of being a [[Communist Party USA|Communist]]. By 1950s, for instance, there were 5,000 names under the Security Index while the Reserve Index had 50,000 in the [[Chicago]] field office.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=FBI Secrets|last=Swearingen|first=M. Wesley|publisher=South End Press|year=1995|isbn=0896085015|location=Boston, MA|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual in the Reserve Index could be transferred to the Security Index if such individual posed a threat to U.S. interests in a period of national emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Color of Law: Ernie Goodman, Detroit, and the Struggle for Labor and Civil Rights|last=Babson|first=Steve|last2=Elsila|first2=David|last3=Riddle|first3=Dave|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780814334966|location=Detroit|pages=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; A difference between these indices involved their color scheme. The files of those under the Security Index were all in white while the Reserve Index varied in colors depending on the occupation of the subject.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Prominent figures listed in the Security Index includes [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]]. The FBI had been monitoring his activities with the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] since 1957 and by 1962, he was finally listed in the FBI index due to the involvement of two of his advisers with the U.S. Communist Party, although he failed to meet the criteria for inclusion in the Security Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide|last=Theoharis|first=Athan|last2=Poveda|first2=Tony|last3=Rosenfeld|first3=Susan|last4=Powers|first4=Richard|publisher=Oryx Press|year=1999|isbn=9780897749916|location=Phoenix|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Security Index itself was merged with the Agitator Index and the Communist Index. Renamed to the Reserve Index in 1960, this index included a Section A for teachers, doctors, lawyers, entertainers, and other people considered influential and not politically conservative.  Hoover had Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. added to the Reserve Index, Section A, in retaliation for his civil rights work and worldwide popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, Curt. J. Edgar Hoover: The man and his Secrets. NY: penguin Group, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renamed again to the Administrative Index (ADEX) in 1971, and allegedly discontinued in 1978, the records are still kept as inactive at FBI headquarters and 29 field offices.&lt;ref name=fas1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationarchive.com/Summaries/v227i0001_06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administrative Index ==
[[File:Adex1.png|right|upright|thumb|FBI rep describing ADEX, 1975&lt;ref name=fbi1/&gt;]]
ADEX, or Administrative Index, lasted from 1971 to January 1978. It integrated the Security Index, the [[Agitator Index]], and the [[Reserve Index]].&lt;ref name=fas1/&gt; It was used to track people "considered to be a threat to the security of the country".&lt;ref name=fbi1/&gt; ADEX had four 'categories'.&lt;ref name=hz1/&gt;

An illustrative example of these files and the rationale for categorization can be seen in the case of historian [[Howard Zinn]], a noted government critic. In his FBI files, there are two separate pages in which an agent says he should be in category III:&lt;ref name=hz1/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He has been a member of the Communist Party, 1949–1953. A chief critic of the United States Government policies. A familiar figure at anti-war demonstrations up to 1972. Organized a protest rally to protest serious indictments against [[Daniel Berrigan|Father Berrigan]] and other members of the East Coast Conspiracy in the Summer of 1971&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is recommended that subject be included in ADEX, Category III, because he has participated in activities of revolutionary organizations within the last five years as evidenced by overt acts and statements established through reliable informants&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Singer [[Paul Robeson]] was also on ADEX as Category III: "because of his long time close contact with CPUSA leaders. He was honored by the CP as recently as 1969".&lt;ref name=robes1/&gt;

The concept of a '''gatekeeper state''' was introduced by the [[History of Africa|Historian of Africa]] [[Frederick Cooper (historian)|Frederick Cooper]] in his book ''Africa Since 1940: The Past of the Present''. It is used to describe African nations whose main function is balancing the instability of internal political control against the influence of external factors.

== Concept ==
According to Cooper, African governments suffer from a peculiar politico-economic dysfunction that derives from a particular historical sequence. Specifically, he contends "Africa was systematically conquered but not so systematically ruled" (2002: 196-197) and hence "colonial states had been gate-keeper states" (''ibid''.: 5) which had "trouble extending their power and their command of people’s respect... inward" (''ibid''.: 156) but could control "the interface of national and world economies" (''ibid''.: 141).

Colonial powers mainly sought to extract resources from Africa (e.g. [[natural resources]], [[Labour economics|labor]]) which resulted in limited political foundation in territories. Ultimately, the authority of colonial regimes depended on the superior military forces of the metropole, which could easily defeat organised resistance but could neither routinize [[authority]] nor gain [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] (''ibid''.: 157).

Over the course of African history, replacement of colonial leaders with native African leaders did little to gain support or stability among constituents.  The survival of each colony therefore still depended on external resources and support, not on internal factors as in established states. Due to weak internal control, this external dependence produced an outward orientation focused on ‘guarding the gate’: gatekeepers collected most of their revenues from taxes on imports and exports, controlled entry and exit visas, distributed foreign aid, decided who could move currency in or out, and [[License raj|issued licenses]] that determined who could engage in business activities (''2002''.: 5, 97, 157).

The post-colonial "successor states," Cooper goes on to argue, inherited the mantle of gate-keeper from their former rulers. Independence, however, greatly exacerbated the negative consequences of gate-keeping because whereas before it was taken for granted who would control the gate (along with the power and wealth derived therefrom), in the post-colonial period there was no external military force to impose order.

Furthermore, unlike the colonial powers (at least before the "development era" after about 1940) African rulers wanted to impose their authority internally in order to affect a far-reaching transformation of the economy and society. And given, moreover, that control of the gate was an "either/or phenomenon" (''ibid''.: 159) or a [[zero-sum game]], the stakes of control were extremely high because the winners gained control of resources they could use to entrench their rule. Consequently, fierce competition for control of the gate arose soon after independence, and this resulted in the collectively irrational political instability that occurred in Africa after independence as evidenced by, among other things, cycles of coups and counter coups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17615">A '''humectant''' {{IPAc-en|h|juː|ˈ|m|ɛ|k|t|ən|t}} is a [[hygroscopic]] [[Chemical substance|substance]] used to keep things moist; it is the opposite of a [[desiccant]] because it is wet.  It is often a molecule with several [[hydrophilic]] groups, most often [[hydroxyl group]]s; however, [[amine]]s and [[carboxyl group]]s, sometimes [[ester]]ified, can be encountered as well (its affinity to form [[hydrogen bond]]s with molecules of water is the crucial trait). They are used in many products, including food, cosmetics, medicines and pesticides.

A humectant attracts and retains the moisture in the air nearby via absorption, drawing the water vapor into or beneath the organism's or object's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/humectant|title=humectant|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=17 November 2016|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-an-humectant.htm|title=What is an Humectant? (with pictures)|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used as a [[food additive]], a humectant has the effect of keeping the foodstuff moist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1bzCYeHoJ8sC&amp;pg=PA343&amp;dq=humectant+food+additives#v=onepage&amp;q=humectant%20food%20additives&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Nutrition and Good Health|last=Ronzio|first=Robert A.|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816066308|location=|pages=343|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humectants are sometimes used as a component of [[antistatic]] coatings for [[plastic]]s.

In pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, humectants can be used in [[topical]] [[dosage form]]s to increase the solubility of a chemical compound's [[active ingredient]]s, increasing the active ingredients' ability to penetrate skin, or its activity time. This hydrating property can also be needed to counteract a dehydrating active ingredient (e.g., [[soap]]s, [[corticoid]]s, and some [[alcohol]]s), which is why humectants are common ingredients in a wide range of cosmetic and personal care products that make moisturization claims (e.g., [[hair conditioner]]s, [[body lotion]]s, face or body cleansers, lip balms, and eye creams).

==Examples==
Examples of some humectants include:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* [[Propylene glycol]], [[hexylene glycol]], and [[butylene glycol]]
* [[Aloe vera]] gel
* [[Alpha hydroxy acid]]s such as [[lactic acid]]
* [[Egg yolk]] and [[egg white]]
* [[Glyceryl triacetate]]
* [[Honey]]
* [[Lithium chloride]]
* [[Molasses]]
* Polymeric [[polyol]]s  such as [[polydextrose]]
* [[Quillaia]]
* [[Sodium hexametaphosphate]] E452i
* [[Sugar alcohol]]s (sugar polyols) such as [[glycerol]], [[sorbitol]], [[xylitol]], [[maltitol]]
* [[UREA]]
{{div col end}}

==Uses==
A humectant is a substance that is used to keep products moisturized and affects the preservation of items, which can be used in cosmetic products, food and tobacco. A
humectant-rich formulation contains simple alcoholic sugar that can increase skin hydration and helps to remove and reduce thickness of skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23521561 | doi=10.1111/srt.12066 | volume=19 | issue=4 | title=The influence of a humectant-rich mixture on normal skin barrier function and on once- and twice-daily treatment of foot xerosis. A prospective, randomized, evaluator-blind, bilateral and untreated-control study | year=2013 | journal=Skin Res Technol | pages=438–45 |vauthors=Lodén M, von Scheele J, Michelson S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food additives===
Some common humectants used in food are [[honey]] and glucose syrup both for their water absorption and sweet flavor.&lt;ref name="Farris, S. S. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Farris S. S. |author2=Piergiovanni L. L. |author3=Limbo S. S. | year = 2008 | title = EFFECT OF BAMBOO FIBRE AND GLUCOSE SYRUP AS NEW INGREDIENTS IN THE MANUFACTURE OF AMARETTI COOKIES | url = | journal = Italian Journal of Food Science | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 75–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose syrup also helps to retain the shape of the product better than other alternatives, for a longer period of time. In addition, some humectants are recognized in different countries as good [[food additives]] because of the increase in nutritional value that they provide, such as [[sodium hexametaphosphate]].&lt;ref&gt;Broad Chemicals as Food Additives. (2010). ''China Chemical Reporter'', 21(4), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to gauge a compound's humectancy, scientists will put it through a series of tests, often involving water absorption. In tests involving toothpaste, the process is also coupled with a sweetness test and a crystallization test. When humectancy is being assessed in different products, testers will compare the results to other humectants that are already used in those products, in order to evaluate efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lu Y. Y. | year = 2001 | title = Humectancies of d-tagatose and d-sorbitol | url = | journal = International Journal of Cosmetic Science | volume = 23 | issue = 3| page = 178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these humectants are seen in non-ionic [[polyols]] like [[sucrose]], [[glycerin]] or [[glycerol]] and its triester ([[triacetin]]). These humectant food additives are used for the purpose of controlling [[viscosity]] and texture. Humectants also add bulk, retain moisture, reduce water activity, and improve softness. A main advantage of humectant food additives is that, since they are non-ionic, they are not expected to influence any variation of the [[pH]] [[aqueous]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Preservatives|doi=10.1002/9781118274132.ch15|journal=Chemistry of Food Additives and Preservatives|pages=224–243|year = 2012|isbn = 9781118274132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glycerol or glycerin humectants undergo a pretreatment process using [[saponification]], bleaching, ion exchange exclusion, both cationic and ionic ion exchanges, vacuum flash evaporation, thin film distillation, and heating to produce a 100% pure glycerol.&lt;ref&gt;Msagati, Titus A. M. ''The Chemistry of Food Additives and Preservatives''. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2013. PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humectants are used in stabilization of food products and lengthening shelf life through food and moisture control. The available moisture determines [[microbial]] activity, physical properties, sensory properties and the rate of chemical changes, that if not controlled, are the cause of reduced shelf life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Severini C. |author2=Corbo M. |author3=Derossi A. |author4=Bevilacqua A. |author5=Giuliani R. | year = 2008 | title = Use of humectants for the stabilization of pesto sauce | url = | journal = International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology | volume = 43 | issue = 6| pages = 1041–1046 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2621.2007.01560.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are dry [[cereal]] with semi-moist [[raisins]], [[ice cream]] in a cone, [[chocolate]], [[hard candy]] with liquid centers and [[cheese]]. Humectants are used to stabilize the moisture content of foodstuffs and are incorporated as food additives. Humectants are also used in military technology for the use of [[MRE]]s and other military rations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-26255153|title=The military pizza that lasts for three years|author=|date=19 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=17 November 2016|via=www.bbc.com|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of food items always need to be moist. The use of humectants reduces the available water, thus reducing bacterial activity. They are used for safety issues, for quality, and to have a longer shelf-life in food products.

An example of where humectants are used to keep food moist is in products like [[toothpaste]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lu | first1 = Y. Y. | year = 2001 | title = Humectancies of d-tagatose and d-sorbitol | url = | journal = International Journal of Cosmetic Science | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 175–81 | doi=10.1046/j.1467-2494.2001.00084.x| pmid = 18498471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as certain kinds of [[cookies]]. Regional kinds of cookies often use humectants as a binding agent in order to keep moisture locked into the center of the cookie rather than have it evaporate out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Farris S. S. |author2=Piergiovanni L. L. |author3=Limbo S. S. | year = 2008 | title = EFFECT OF BAMBOO FIBRE AND  GLUCOSE SYRUP AS NEW INGREDIENTS IN THE MANUFACTURE OF AMARETTI COOKIES | url = | journal = Italian Journal of Food Science | volume = 20 | issue = 1| page = 77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humectants are favored in food products because of their ability to keep consumable goods moist and increase shelf-life.&lt;ref name="Farris, S. S. 2008"/&gt;

===Cosmetics===
Humectants are frequently used in cosmetics as a way of increasing and maintaining moisture in the skin and hair, in  products including shampoo, conditioner, frizz serum, lotions, creams, lip treatments, cleansers, after-sun lotion, and some soaps or body lotions. As hygroscopic moisturizers, humectants work by attracting water to the upper layer of the skin (stratum corneum).&lt;ref&gt;Making Cosmetics, Inc. http://www.makingcosmetics.com/articles/13-humectants-moisturizing-agents-in-cosmetics.pdf (Accessed 5/10/14{{Clarify|reason=ambiguous date format|date=November 2016}})&lt;/ref&gt; All humectants have common hydroxyl groups which allow them to participate in hydrogen bonding and attract water. This process attracts moisture from the outer layer of the skin or, in high humidity, from the atmosphere. The moisture is then trapped against the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] or the shaft of the hair, depending on where the humectant is applied. Various humectants have different ways of behaving because they differ in water binding capacity at different humidities.&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, P., Maibach, H. (2005) Cosmecuticals and Active Cosmetics – Drugs Versus Cosmetics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humectants used in cosmetics include [[triethylene glycol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = Final Report on the Safety Assessment of Triethylene Glycol and PEG-41 | url = | journal = International Journal of Toxicology | volume = 25 | issue = 2_suppl| pages = 121–138 | doi = 10.1080/10915810600964642 | pmid = 17090481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tripropylene|tripropylene glycol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fiume M. M. |author2=Bergfeld W. F. |author3=Belsito D. V. |author4=Hill R. A. |author5=Klaassen C. D. |author6=Liebler D. |author7=Andersen F. | year = 2012 | title = Safety Assessment of Propylene Glycol, Tripropylene Glycol, and PPGs as Used in Cosmetics | url = | journal = International Journal of Toxicology | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 245S–260S | doi = 10.1177/1091581812461381 |pmid=23064775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[propylene glycol]], and [[Polypropylene glycol|PPGs]]. Other popular humectants in cosmetics include glycerin, sorbitol (sugar alcohol), hexylene and butylene glycol, urea, and collagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Peng Y. |author2=Glattauer V. |author3=Werkmeister J. A. |author4=Ramshaw J. A. M. | year = 2004 | title = Evaluation for collagen products for cosmetic application | url = | journal = International Journal of Cosmetic Science | volume = 26 | issue = 6| page = 313 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-2494.2004.00245_2.x |citeseerx=10.1.1.504.6688 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glycerin is one of the most popular humectants used because it produces the desired result fairly frequently and is low in cost. A category of humectants called nanolipidgels allow skin to retain moisture, but also possess antifungal properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nanolipidgel for enhanced skin deposition and improved antifungal activity|first1=Preeti|last1=Wavikar|first2=Pradeep|last2=Vavia|date=1 March 2013|journal=AAPS PharmSciTech|volume=14|issue=1|pages=222–233|doi=10.1208/s12249-012-9908-y|pmid=23263751|pmc=3581678}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists are also working to discover different types of humectants; a study published in 2011 concluded that extracts from wine cakes have the potential to be used as a humectant in cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chiang H. |author2=Ko Y. |author3=Shih I. |author4=Wen K. | year = | title = Development of Wine Cake as a Skin-Whitening Agent and Humectant | url = | journal = Journal of Food &amp; Drug Analysis | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 223–229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humectants have been added to skin moisturizing products to treat [[xerosis]]. Some moisturizers tend to weaken the skin barrier function, but studies on xerosis have proven that moisturizers containing humectants increase desired moisturizing effects on the affected area without damage to the skin barrier function.&lt;ref name=Loden&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lodén, M., Scheele, J., &amp; Michelson, S. | date = 2013 | title = The influence of a humectant-rich mixture on normal skin barrier function and on once- and twice-daily treatment of foot xerosis. A prospective, randomized, evaluator-blind, bilateral and untreated-control study | journal = Skin Research &amp; Technology | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 438–445}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this xerosis treatments study, some “smarting and stinging” was also reported from the use of humectant-rich treatment products.&lt;ref name=Loden/&gt;

When the humectant glycerol was added to soaps for the cleansing of wounds, similar effects were found. There was an increase in moisture in the areas that the soap was applied, however, “further consideration of conditioning the use of glycerol to improve the absorption of exudates from wounds for an advanced wound healing is needed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gwon, H., Lim, Y., Nho, Y., &amp; Baik, S. | date = 2010 | title = Humectants effect on aqueous fluids absorption of γ-irradiated PVA hydrogel followed by freeze thawing | journal = Radiation Physics &amp; Chemistry | volume = 79 | issue = 5 | pages = 650–653 | doi=10.1016/j.radphyschem.2009.12.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The healing properties of humectants are therefore uncertain.

===Tobacco products===
Humectants are used in the manufacturing of some [[tobacco]] products, such as [[cigarettes]], [[e-cigarettes]], and self-rolled tobacco. They are used to control and maintain the moisture content of the cut tobacco filler and add flavor. Humectants are vital to the creation of cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Heck D. |author2=Gaworski C. |author3=Rajendran N. |author4=Morrissey R. | year = 2002 | title = Toxicologic Evaluation of Humectants Added To Cigarette Tobacco: 13-Week Smoke Inhalation Study | url = | journal = Inhalation Toxicology | volume = 14 | issue = 11| pages = 1135–1152 | doi = 10.1080/08958370290084827 |pmid=12454795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an examination of waterpipe smoking, researchers worked to identify substances such as [[Formaldehyde|formaldehyde]], [[Acetaldehyde|acetaldehyde]], and [[Acrolein|acrolein]] in the smoke of a waterpipe, discovering that the value of formaldehyde detected in one smoking session was five times higher than that of a regular cigarette. This data demonstrated that increasing amounts of humectants in the unburned tobacco lowered the temperature in the waterpipe head during smoking, so that considerable amounts of toxic substances were present. Further, e-cigarettes produce aerosol by heating a humectant containing nicotine without burning tobacco. Those “vaping” then inhale the aerosol and receive nicotine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unboundmedicine.com/evidence/ub/citation/22707202/Waterpipe_smoking:_the_role_of_humectants_in_the_release_of_toxic_carbonyls_ Schubert, J. Waterpipe smoking: the role of humectants in the release of toxic carbonyls. ''Archives of Toxicology'', 86, 1309–1316]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main health concern regarding e-cigarettes is that their production is not regulated, and there is immense uncertainty of quality control during manufacturing. Self-rolled tobacco contains more humectants, which are added to tobacco to make it taste better and keep from drying out. As the humectants burn, they unleash chemicals such as acrolein. Humectants are found in most cigarettes and are considered one of the most dangerous chemicals found in tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smokefreeoxfordshire.nhs.uk/why-stop-smoking/smoking-its-dangers/roll-ups/ Roll-ups. 2012, January 1. Retrieved May 11, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have been conflicting claims about the degree to which these products warrant a health concern. In a literary study of e-cigarette health risks, 388 different symptoms were reported; mouth and throat concerns generated more negative symptoms than any other group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmir.org/2013/4/e59/|title=Health-Related Effects Reported by Electronic Cigarette Users in Online Forums|first1=My|last1=Hua|first2=Mina|last2=Alfi|first3=Prue|last3=Talbot|date=1 January 2013|volume=15|issue=4|accessdate=17 November 2016|doi=10.2196/jmir.2324|pmid=23567935|pmc=3636314|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|pages=e59}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are not enough studies or sufficient evidence to suggest that products, particularly the contaminants of the aerosol in e-cigarettes, produce health risks at a concerning level. More research is currently being conducted to find the true dangers of the use of humectants in cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Burstyn  | year = 2014 | title = Peering through the mist: systematic review of what the chemistry of contaminants in electronic cigarettes tells us about health risks | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3937158/pdf/1471-2458-14-18.pdf | format = PDF | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 14 | issue = | page = 18 | pmc=3937158 | pmid=24406205 | doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Italian irredentist map, 1918. Malta is marked in red.]]

'''Italian irredentism in Malta''' is related to the Maltese people who supported [[Italian irredentism]] in [[Malta]] and believe the Maltese islands are part of [[Italy]]. Italian irredentism in Malta refers to past support in [[Malta]] for Italian [[Territorial dispute|territorial claims]] on the islands. It is therefore not be confused with [[Italophilia]]. Although [[Malta]] had formally ceased to be part of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] only since 1814 following the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]], Italian irredentism in Malta was of some significance mainly during the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Melita Historica|last=Frendo|first=Henry|title=Intra-European Colonial Nationalism: The Case of Malta: 1922-1927|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.11(1992-95)/MH.11(1992)1/07.pdf|volume=11|issue=1|pages=79-93|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416143544/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.11(1992-95)/MH.11(1992)1/07.pdf|archive-date=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italy and Malta before 1814 ==
''Main: [[Italian Maltese]]''
[[File:Malta mapa2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of Malta in the 16th century, when Italian was declared the official language by the Knights of Malta]] 
Until the end of the 18th century [[History of Malta|Malta's]] fortunes—political, economic, religious, cultural—were closely tied with [[History of Sicily|Sicily's]]. Successive waves of immigration from Sicily and Italy strengthened these ties and increased the [[demography|demographic]] similarity. Italian was Malta's language of administration, law, contracts and public records, [[Culture of Malta|Malta's culture]] was similar to [[Culture of Italy|Italy's]], Malta's nobility was originally composed of Italian families who had moved to Malta mainly in the 13th century and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malta|Maltese Catholic Church]] was suffragan of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Palermo|Archdiocese of Palermo]].

There were minor and subtle differences, however. In the early 15th century Malta was incorporated directly into the Sicilian crown following an uprising which led to the abolishment of the [[Count of Malta|County of Malta]]. Domestic governance was thus left to the ''Università'' and the Popular Council, early forms of representative local government. The [[Maltese language]], the creation of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malta|Diocese of Malta]] as well as the [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|granting]] of Malta to the [[Knights Hospitaller]] in 1530 were developments which started to give a distinct character to Maltese culture and history.

Following a brief [[French occupation of Malta|French occupation]] (1798–1800) the British took [[Malta Protectorate|military control]] of Malta even though it was still formally part of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. The initial intention - expressed in the [[Treaty of Amiens]] - was to re-establish the "status quo ante" returning Malta to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, but British interests in the Mediterranean changed it abruptly. So  Malta became a [[Malta Colony|British Crown Colony]] in 1813 even if with diplomatic protests from southern Italian authorities, which was confirmed a year later through the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]].

== Italian culture in Malta between 1814 and the Fascist era ==
Cultural changes were few even after 1814. In 1842, all literate Maltese learned Italian while only 4.5% could read, write and/or speak English.&lt;ref&gt;Brincat, Giuseppe. "Malta. Una storia linguistica".Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; However there was a huge increase in the number of maltese magazines and newspapers in Italian language during the 1800s and early 1900s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girodivite.it/Sergio-Portelli.html Italian magazines in Malta during the 1800s (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;, so as a consequence the Italian was understood (but not spoken fluently) by more than half the Maltese people before [[WW1]].
[[File:SetteGiugno2009.jpg|thumb|The [[Sette Giugno]] monument, symbol of the pro-[[Italian Maltese]].]]

In 1878, a Royal Commission ([[the Rowsell-Julyan-Keenan Commission]]) recommended in its report the [[Anglicisation]] of the educational and judicial systems. While the judicial system remained predominantly Italian until the 20th century, teaching of the English language started to be enforced in State schools at the expense of Italian. In 1911, English overtook Italian as the secondary language after Maltese, spoken fluently by 13.1% of the population compared to 11.5% for Italian.

The Royal Commission's report also had significant political impact. Supporters and opponents organised themselves into a Reform and Anti-Reform parties which, apart from being the forerunners of the present day two main political parties in Malta, assumed respectively the [[anglophile]] and [[italophile]] imprint (and also, subsequently, pro-colonial and anti-colonial policies) that were to characterise them for decades to come.

[[Sette Giugno]], a popular revolt in Malta in 1919, was later considered in fascist Italy as the beginning of the "active" Italian irredentism in Malta. This commemoration (official since 1986) is in remembrance of the riots of 1919 when the Maltese population revolted against the British government to obtain some form of representative government. Four people died when fire was opened on the protesters.

== Fascist era and World War II ==
[[File:Enrico Mizzi 140x190.jpg|thumb|[[Enrico Mizzi]] (Malta Prime Minister in 1950) was jailed in 1940 for his "pro-Italian irredentism" opinions.]]
The Fascists invested heavily in promoting Italian culture in Malta. They were making overtures to a minority who not only loved Italy's language but also saw Malta as a geographical extension of the Italian mainland. Malta was described as "the extreme end of Italian soil" (Senator Caruana Gatto who represented the nobility in the Maltese in 1923).

The battle, however, was still being fought in largely cultural terms, as the "Language Question" on the role of Italian in education. This led to the revoking (the second) of the Maltese Constitution in 1934 over the Government's budgetary vote for the teaching of Italian in elementary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ITA2413/_P6.HTM |title=Studi maltesi: testo – IntraText CT |publisher=Intratext.com |date=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian was eventually dropped from official language status in Malta in 1934, its place being taken by Maltese. Italian ceased to be taught at all levels of education and the language of instruction at the [[University of Malta]] and the Law Courts. In 1935 there were manifestations against all these decisions, promoted by the Maltese fascists: the Nationalist Party declared that most of the Maltese population was supporting directly or indirectly the [[Italian Maltese]]'s struggle. But when [[Italy]] entered the war on the side of the [[Axis powers]] and aerial bombardments of Malta began, what little interest in Italian irredentism that existed in Malta was lost.

The colonial authorities however took precautions: in 1940 they interned and eventually deported to Uganda 49 [[italophile]] Maltese including the leader of the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]], [[Enrico Mizzi]]. Other 700 Maltese with ideals linked to the Italian irredentism in Malta were sent to concentration camps in central Africa &lt;ref&gt;Article in Italian about Borg Pisani, in which many of the 700 Maltese irredentists are named ([http://www.isses.it/borg.htm])&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Maltese living in Italy participated in fascist organizations and joined the Italian military forces during World War II. Among them were [[Carmelo Borg Pisani]], Antonio Cortis, Paolo Frendo, Ivo Leone Ganado, Roberto Mallia, Manuele Mizzi, Antonio Vassallo, Joe d’Ancona and Carlo Liberto. Carmelo Borg Pisani attempted to enter Malta during the war ([[Operation Herkules]]), but was captured and executed as an alleged spy in November 1942. He received the [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]], the highest Italian military award, by King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] a few days after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quirinale.it/elementi/DettaglioOnorificenze.aspx?decorato=14144|title=Le onorificenze della Repubblica Italiana|work=Segretariato generale della Presidenza della Repubblica-Servizio sistemi informatici- reparto |trans-title=Italian Republic official list and motivation|publisher=Quirinale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Requests have been made by his family and the Italian government to exhume his body and give it a burial outside prison grounds, which request has never been acceded to. [[Benito Mussolini]] called him a "Maltese Martyr" and created in his honor in [[Liguria]] the ''Battaglione Borg Pisani'' in November 1943, in which other Maltese irredentists fought.

== After World War II ==

Since World War II, there have been no calls for Italian irredentism in Malta. Enrico Mizzi become Malta's [[Prime Minister of Malta|Prime Minister]] in 1950, but never denied his past when promoved the union of Malta to Italy: he defined himself as "a man without stain and without fear" (in Italian : "Uomo senza macchia e senza paura")&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Mizzi declared in 1949, just before being elected Prime Minister: "I hope that when I pass from this life to become a memory to posterity I hope no one will slander me... for party reasons.... As I had been declared by the Nationalist Party some thirty years ago, I am still, thank God, before the Party, before the people, and above all else before my own conscience 'senza macchia e senza paura'." (''Legislative Assembly Debates'', Sitting No 8, 17 March 1949, p.397)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Khotin Uprising''' was an [[insurrection]] by [[Ukrainians]] in northern [[Bessarabia]] less than a year after its [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|Union]] with the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]], on January 23–February 1, 1919. The city of Khotin ({{lang-uk|Хотин, [[Khotyn]]}}, {{lang-ro|Hotin}}) is located now in the [[Chernivtsi Oblast]], [[Ukraine]].

==Historical context==
In 1918 the town of Khotin was annexed to [[Greater Romania]], along with the rest of Bessarabia, after its representative body ([[Sfatul Ţării]]) voted to join Romania. Bessarabia had been part of the [[Russian Empire]] since the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)]]. The Khotin region (The Northern part of the Khotin/[[Hotin County]]) had acquired a large Ukrainian population during the 19th century by migration from neighboring [[Podolia]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} and many villages became almost entirely Ukrainian. Before 1713, the region was part of [[Moldavia]], which is why Romania made claims to the region.

==Romanian occupation==
During [[World War I]] fighting in the region, [[Austria-Hungary]] had occupied most of the Khotyn/Hotin county in late 1917 and early 1918. While, the rest of Bessarabia was under Romanian control from the vote in Sfatul Ţării on April 9, 1918, the region occupied by Austrian troops remained under Austrian control. The Romanian troops took control of it only when the Central Powers were defeated. They entered the city on November 10, 1918,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bucoda.cv.ua/Hotyn1000/history.html Хотину - 1000 років! - Історія та сьогодення&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; just after Romania re-entered the war on the side of the Allies and were met with active resistance{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}&lt;!--it would be nice to have a link to a source here. Obviously, Ukrainians were not thrilled, but since the text claims "active resistance", giving a source right away would be logical--&gt; of the Ukrainian population and the official protest from the [[Ukrainian State]], which also laid claim on it. The area's swift occupation by the Romanian troops was largely supported by the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] that considered Romania instrumental for stopping the spreading of [[Bolshevism]] towards the south-Eastern Europe.

The Ukrainian population saw the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] whose lands where just across the [[Dniester River]] as the solution to their strive for self-determination. However, the UPR was involved at the time in an armed conflict with the Bolshevik forces, while the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], another nascent Ukrainian state to the north of the region, was at the time involved in a [[Polish-Ukrainian War|war with Poland]] which eventually crushed the Western Ukrainian statehood attempt. Both conflicts involved all of the Ukrainian military forces, and none could be spared to start yet another armed conflict with Romania.

==The Uprising==
The first task of the Romanian force was to suppress and harass the Ukrainian population who saw little future for themselves in the [[Kingdom of Romania]].&lt;ref name=Derh&gt;Oleksandr Derhachov (editor), "Українська державність у XX столітті." (Ukrainian Statehood in the Twentieth Century: Historical and Political Analysis), Chapter: "Ukraine in Romanian concepts of the foreign policy", 1996, Kiev {{ISBN|966-543-040-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such policies only radicalised the opposition and in the night of January 23 the population of Khotin rose into armed rebellion. By the morning the city was cleared of Romanian forces and in two following days the entire district was seized by the partisans. The power was assumed by a newly created 5-member ''Khotyn Directory'' (head - M. Liskun, secretary - L. Tokan),&lt;ref name="Вiртуальна Русь: Бібліотека"&gt;[http://www.vesna.org.ua/txt/dov/istukr/IIIh.html Вiртуальна Русь: Бібліотека&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720092245/http://www.vesna.org.ua/txt/dov/istukr/IIIh.html |date=2006-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that proclaimed the right of self-determination for the Bessarabians and "overthrowing of the Romanian yoke". The directory of UNR has sent to the uprising its representative I. Maevki, and helped them with weapons. Three regiments were created, centered in three villages: Rukshin, Anadol, Dankovtsi.

Seeing little chance to obtain any assistance from the nascent Ukrainian states they had to rely on their own in an attempt to liberate themselves from Romanian rule.  The rebel force quickly grew to almost 30,000 people organized into three infantry regiments, a cavalry squadron and an artillery squadron.&lt;ref name=Dovidn&gt;Dovidnyk z istoriï Ukraïny, 3-Volumes, Article "[http://www.vesna.org.ua/txt/dov/istukr/IIIh.html Hotyns'ke Povstannya, 1919] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720092245/http://www.vesna.org.ua/txt/dov/istukr/IIIh.html |date=2006-07-20 }}" (T.3), Kiev, 1993-1999, {{ISBN|5-7707-5190-8}} (t. 1), {{ISBN|5-7707-8552-7}} (t. 2), {{ISBN|966-504-237-8}} (t. 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Khotyn region were regarded as of secondary importance by the Romanian authorities until the uprising, the killing of Romanian general [[Stan Poetaş]] in the village of Atachi, a northern suburb of Khotyn, the highest ranking Romanian officer killed during World War I, has awakened them to the importance of the territory.  A week later, major forces of the Romanian army arrived to the area in order to quell the rebellion.  The rebels could not succeed against the well-organized regular army equipped with the modern ammunition, partly provided by the Entente. The Ukrainians retreated towards the Dniester River still hoping to receive some assistance from the UPR; the latter, however, facing the critical situation in the war with the Bolshevik forces was unable to provide any.  Romanian Army re-took control of the region on February 1, 1919.  Facing tremendous losses from the overwhelming Romanian force, the guerrillas rushed across the river followed by the refugees.  About 4,000 fighters and up to 50,000 refugees crossed into Ukraine during the 12 days of the uprising.&lt;ref name=ukrainozna&gt;Volodymyr Kubiiovych;  Zenon Kuzelia, ''Енциклопедія українознавства (Encyclopedia of Ukrainian studies)'', 3-volumes,  Kiev, 1994, {{ISBN|5-7702-0554-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them returned several months later, when the Romanian authorities, under pressure from local Ukrainian civilians whose husbands fled, declared an amnesty.

==Aftermath==
The plight of those who remained was miserable. The number of people killed in action or executed by Romanian authorities is estimated to be up to 15,000.&lt;ref name=Dovidn/&gt; During the reign of terror that followed, dozens of Ukrainian villages in Bukovina were set on fire (Рукшин, Недобоївці, Ширівці, Ставчани, Керстенці, etc.)&lt;ref name="Вiртуальна Русь: Бібліотека"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burkut&gt;Ihor Burkut, [http://chas.ukr.rom.cv.ua/History/History_019.htm Khotyn uprising against Greater Romania], "[http://www.chas.cv.ua/arhiv/2-03/golovna.htm Chas]", January 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and razed to the ground{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}&lt;!--request for citation, indicating which villages were rased to the ground--&gt;. The plunder by the Romanian army was accompanied by a large scale maraudering,&lt;ref name=Burkut/&gt; 
torture{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} and rape.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Until 1940, when the area was ceded to the [[Soviet Union]] following the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina#Soviet ultimatum|Soviet Ultimatum to Romania]], the authorities implemented a policy of forced [[Romanianization]] of the Ukrainian population.

The Romanian historian Ion Nistor ascribed the revolt partly to the Bolshevik agitation, trying to minimize the role of the anti-Ukrainian actions of the Romanian Troops in the region.&lt;ref name=Revis&gt;L. "Mişcarea subversivă în Basarabia", [[Chişinău]], 1925; [[Ion Nistor]], "Istoria Basarabiei, Chişinău, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rebels were separated from Bolshevik forces by the lands of the UPR which was involved in its own armed conflict with the Bolsheviks.

The Military Technical Agreement between the International Security Force ("KFOR") and the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia (commonly known as the Military Technical Agreement or Kumanovo Agreement) was an accord concluded on 9 June 1999 in [[Kumanovo]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. It concluded the [[Kosovo War]]. The full text can be found on the website of [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |title= Military Technical Agreement between the International Security Force ("KFOR") and the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia |last= NATO |authorlink = |date= 1999-06-09 |url= http://www.nato.int/kosovo/docu/a990609a.htm |accessdate= 2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The run-up to the Kumanovo Agreement involved a flurry of negotiations not just between Yugoslavia and Serbia but also NATO and Russia. Despite the initial agreement, for instance, on a withdrawal timetable for the Serbian forces in Kosovo, NATO's Operation Allied Force was still underway, pending the completion of full withdrawal of the Serbian troops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Russian Civil-Military Relations and the Origins of the Second Chechen War|last=Lajos|first=Szaszdi|publisher=University Press of America, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=9780761840374|location=Lanham|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are sources that cite the role that Russia played in the immediate resolution of the accord. There was a claim about a meeting between [[Igor Ivanov|Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov]] and [[Madeleine Albright|U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright]]. An initial agreement between the two parties was reached, which involved a commitment on the part of NATO to cease its airstrikes and a willingness to remove a passage it wanted to include in the Kumanovo Agreement in exchange for Russian support for a forthcoming UN Resolution agreed by the [[Group of Eight]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Without the Russian participation, the UN Security Council Resolution on Kosovo would not have been approved and the NATO airstrikes would have continued.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

==Provisions of the agreement==

The key provisions of the agreement were designed to enable the following:

* A cessation of hostilities between [[NATO]]'s [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) and the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FRY) followed by an end to the bombing campaign should FRY comply effectively with the agreement.
* Definition of a 25 km air safety zone and 5km ground safety zone around Kosovo's boundaries, into FRY where necessary, which FRY forces could not enter without NATO permission.
* Over 11 days from signing, the staged withdrawal from Kosovo by FRY forces, including the clearing of military assets (mines, booby traps) from communications lines, and the provision of information to NATO about remaining hazards.
* The deployment of civil and security forces within Kosovo, pursuant to an at that point unapproved, but drafted [[United Nations Security Council]] Resolution.

The NATO presence was sanctioned by the [[United Nations Security Council]] on the strength of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|Resolution 1244]] (1999), which authorized UN Member states and international organizations to maintain an international security presence via the KFOR in Kosovo until an agreement is finally concluded and its terms implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: A Commentary|last=Dorr|first=Oliver|last2=Schmalenbach|first2=Kirsten|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783662551592|location=London|pages=958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KFOR was authorized to take all actions necessary to ensure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law|last=Weller|first=Marc|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780199673049|location=Oxford|pages=976}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Status of agreement==
Legal expert Enrico Milano has argued that the Kumanovo Agreement "is dubious under the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] (VCLT) and, as a consequence, so too are parts of Resolution 1244 referring, implicitly or explicitly, to paragraph 10 of Annex 2 of the same resolution."&lt;ref name="action"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Security Council Action in the Balkans: Reviewing the Legality of Kosovo’s Territorial Status | first= Enrico | last= Milano | journal= [[European Journal of International Law]] | volume= 14 | issue= 5 | year= 2003 | pages= 999–1022 | doi= 10.1093/ejil/14.5.999 | url= http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/14/5/455.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One particular argument is that "it is doubtful whether the Kumanovo Agreement can be considered valid according to Article 52 of the VCLT, which states that ‘a treaty is void if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations’. The legal arguments continue that in fact to remedy the legal issues arising what is needed is for Status of Forces Agreement to be entered into with Belgrade.&lt;ref name="action"/&gt;

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ([[LGBT]]) people in [[Piauí]],  a  [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Brazil]] located in the country's [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]] enjoy  many of the same legal protections available to non-LGBT people. Homosexuality is legal in the state.

==Recognition of same-sex marriages==
*On December 14, 2012, the Court of [[Piauí]] began granting same-sex couples marriage licenses through all notaries statewide, thus ending a long struggle for marriage equality in state. Now, couples do not need to have a judge's approval to get married. This change was published officially in the 'Diário do Justiça' of this state on December 17, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diariodeteresina.com.br/chamadas/corregedoria-do-tj-regulamenta-casamento-gay-no-piaui/#.UNEVbuSZmSo Casamento gay no PI/Same-sex marriage in PI&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; {{pt icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lyndale Park''' is a [[Minneapolis]] city park on the northeast side of [[Lake Harriet (Minnesota)|Lake Harriet]]. It is next to [[Lakewood Cemetery]], southeast of [[Bde Maka Ska]]. It is part of an enormous greenspace circling through Minneapolis called the [[Grand Rounds Scenic Byway]], and is one of the seven districts within, called the [[Chain of Lakes (Minneapolis)|Chain of Lakes]].  The other six districts within Grand Rounds are the Downtown Riverfront, [[Mississippi River]], [[Minnehaha]], [[Theodore Wirth]], [[Victory Memorial Parkway]], and Northeast.  Managed by the [[Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board]], the {{convert|53|mi|km|sing=on}} parkway system has numerous parks and parkways, lakes (22 within the city limits), streams and creeks, the Mississippi River, and the {{convert|53|ft|m|sing=on}} high [[Minnehaha Falls]].  The {{convert|6400|acre|km2|sing=on}} park system is designed so that every home in Minneapolis is within six blocks of green space.

Lyndale Park is {{convert|61|acre|m2}} and contains four gardens; the Peace Garden, the Rose Garden, the Perennial Garden, and the Perennial Trial Garden. Immediately adjacent to the Peace Garden is the Thomas Sadler Roberts Bird Sanctuary.

==Arboretum==
The park's [[arboretum]] was conceived by [[Theodore Wirth]] in 1907 and by 1915 the bulk of the collection had been planted.  Many of the original plantings still survive.  Major collections include [[rose]]s and [[Malus|crabapple trees]].  Heritage trees, defined as the oldest or largest specimen found within the city limits, include the Cucumber Magnolia, River Birch, Golden Larch, Mugo Pine, White Fir, Austrian Pine, Japanese Yew, and Wafer Ash.

==Rose Gardens==
This is the second oldest public rose garden in the United States and was designed by the Park Superintendent Theodore Wirth. It is {{convert|1|acre|m2|sing=on}} in size and at peak season the garden can contain as many as 60,000 blooms.  Construction of the garden occurred during 1907-08. An official AARS (All America Rose Selections) test rose garden was added in 1946. The garden features more than 4000 plants and 250 species. Two fountains border the garden; the bronze-and-marble Heffelfinger Fountain is from the Villa Montalto near Florence, Italy and donated to the Park Board by Frank Heffelfinger in 1944. There is a cherub surfing on a dolphin at the top, surrounded by satyrs. Human faces on the pedestal base show the progress of age.

==Perennial Garden and Perennial Trial Garden==
This garden was built in 1962-63 when the Phelps (turtle) fountain was moved from the downtown Gateway to the east end of this garden. Two long perennial borders edge this garden and six annual beds are featured between these borders. Many wedding ceremonies are performed in this garden area located between the Phelps and Heffelfinger fountains.

The Perennial Trial Garden is a recent addition to the Lyndale Park, and features perennials that are tested over several seasons for hardiness, disease resistance and other features. Maintained by the volunteers from the Men's Garden Club of Minneapolis, this garden is a meandering border that begins near King's Highway and follows the wood line down towards the Peace Garden. This perennial trial garden is planted in the area once occupied by an elaborate perennial border that was first installed in 1925 and later abandoned in the 1960s.

==Thomas Sadler Roberts Bird Sanctuary==
{{main|Thomas Sadler Roberts Bird Sanctuary}}
Primarily a sanctuary for migratory songbirds in the spring, the warblers are the primary attraction. The Minnesota Audubon Society offers free tours every Tuesday at 9a during April and May.  It is also a quiet and peaceful nature walk in the midst of the city.  The main entrance to the sanctuary is in the Lyndale Park Gardens parking lot, and trails through that back of the Peace Garden.  Named for [[Thomas Sadler Roberts]], M.D., D.Sc. (1858&amp;ndash;1946), Founding Member of the Minneapolis Young Naturalists Society, and the [[American Ornithologists' Union]], and member of the Minnesota Ornithologists' Union.

==Lyndale Farmstead Park==
Another park with a similar name, Lyndale Farmstead Park, is a separate park located between West 38th Street and West 40th Street on Bryant Avenue South.  Lyndale Farmstead Park contains a recreation center and the [[Theodore Wirth]] house, [[Theodore Wirth House-Administration Building]].  The house is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

'''Nabil Sahraoui''' (26 September 1969 – 20 June 2004), alias '''Mustapha Abou Ibrahim''', was an Algerian [[Islamist]] militant, and the head of the radical ''Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat'' (GSPC, later renamed [[Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb]]) from August 2003 until his death the following year.

==Early life==
Sahraoui was born in [[Batna, Algeria]], on 26 September 1966.&lt;ref name=iwire&gt;{{cite news|title=Algerian Islamist GSPC leader Nabil Sahraoui profiled|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-21485118_ITM|accessdate=23 January 2013|newspaper=Asia Africa Intelligence Wire|date=28 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==GSPC==
In 2003, Sahraoui replaced [[Hassan Hattab]] as the leader of the GSPC, since the latter was removed from the post due to his view that reconciliation with the government should be encouraged.&lt;ref name=tawil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tawil|first=Camille|title=New Strategies in al-Qaeda’s Battle for Algeria|journal=Terrorism Monitor|date=27 July 2009|volume=7|issue=22|url=https://www.cimicweb.org/cmo/medbasin/Documents/North%20Africa/Security/New%20Strategies-AQ%20battle%20for%20Algeria.pdf|accessdate=21 January 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003, Sahraoui pledged allegiance as GSPC leader to both [[Usama bin Ladin]]'s [[Al Qaeda]] organization and to the Taliban leader [[Mullah Omar]].&lt;ref name=guido&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Guido|title=Towards a "political turn" in the fight against Jihadist terrorism|journal=Politique Etrangere|year=2008|pages=175–187|url=http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/fachpublikationen/ksSteinberg_Political_Turn.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''People's National Party''' of [[Belize]] was a political movement headquartered in [[Punta Gorda, Belize|Punta Gorda]], [[Toledo District]], Belize. Operating primarily in southern Belize, the party fielded candidates in the [[Belizean general election, 2008|2008]] and [[Belizean general and local elections, 2012|2012 general elections]]. It held its first meeting on Monday, 19 February 2007 in [[San Antonio, Toledo|San Antonio Village]], Toledo District. 

In September 2015 the party merged with elements of [[Vision Inspired by the People]] and other opposition political groups to form the [[Belize Progressive Party]].&lt;ref name="merger"&gt;[http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/119488 "A New, Consolidated Third Party Emerges"], [[Great Belize Television]], 1 October 2015. (accessed 2 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The party leader was Wil Maheia, who is a consultant in farming, tourism and the environment. Maheia stood in the [[Toledo East]] constituency in the 2008 and 2012 elections. The PNP ran seven candidates in 2012, but failed to crack six percent of the vote in any race.&lt;ref name="2k12"&gt;[http://www.elections.gov.bz/modules/wfdownloads/visit.php?cid=14&amp;lid=545 GENERAL ELECTION RESULTS 2012], [[Belize Elections and Boundaries Commission]]. (accessed 19 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Maheia also led PNP slates in municipal elections in Punta Gorda, most recently in [[Belizean municipal elections, 2015|March 2015]].&lt;ref name="15results"&gt;[http://www.elections.gov.bz/modules/article_publish/?tac=RESULTS_4th_MARCH_2015"  MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS OFFICIAL RESULTS 4th MARCH 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913001908/http://www.elections.gov.bz/modules/article_publish/?tac=RESULTS_4th_MARCH_2015 |date=2015-09-13 }}, [[Belize Elections and Boundaries Commission]]. (accessed 16 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Maheia became the deputy leader of the BPP upon its founding.

==Ideology==

The PNP's platform was anti-corruption and favoured campaign finance reform as well as increased local control in Belizean government. The party strongly opposeed making any territorial concessions with respect to the ongoing [[Belizean–Guatemalan territorial dispute]], inclusive of accepting any potential rulings from the [[International Court of Justice]] on the matter.&lt;ref name="platform"&gt;[http://www.pnpbelize.org/policies.html National Policy Goals: Governance], People's National Party. (accessed 15 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Maheia in particular is a strident opponent of Guatemalan territorial claims in Belize.&lt;ref name="border"&gt;[http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/83194 "Another border line clearing by Wil Maheia and his Territorial Volunteers"], [[Great Belize Television]], 15 March 2013. (accessed 19 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alliances ==
The PNP joined a coalition of third parties contesting the 2008 general elections, known as the [[National Belizean Alliance]] (NBA). The NBA elected Maheia as leader, however the alliance became defunct after the election.

In the years prior to the merger, the PNP maintained an informal alliance with the [[Belmopan]]-based Vision Inspired by the People, with which it shared similar anti-corruption stances.&lt;ref name="coalition"&gt;[http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=31779 "Who Will Be PG's Mayor?"], [[Tropical Vision Limited]], 2 March 2015.

"Aguas Blancas" were at that time economically irrelevant. The border Peru-Bolivia was not officially determined, and different maps show different boundary lines.]]

The '''Peruvian nitrate monopoly'''{{efn-ua|In Spanish, it is also known as the "Peruvian saltpeter monopoly" (''Monopolio peruano del salitre'') and "Peruvian saltpeter state monopoly" (''Estanco peruano del salitre'').}} was a [[state monopoly|state-owned enterprise]] over the mining and sale of [[saltpeter]] ([[sodium nitrate]]){{refn|group=nota|This chemical has several names depending on how and where it is produced: [[Nitratine]], saltpeter, salpeter, Sodium nitrate, salitre or [[caliche]]. The first saltpeter works, with low capital costs, were named ''paradas''; subsequent works, using the more efficient but costly Shanks system, were called ''oficinas'', and the whole place (deposits, installations, machinery, roads) ''salitrera'' sometimes ''calichera'', and the owners were the ''salitreros''. Regarding weights, there were ''quintal métrico'' (qm) of 100 [[kg]] and ''quintal español'' (qq) of 46 kg.&lt;ref name="Crozier 1997"/&gt;{{rp|58}} Estanco is a Spanish word for Monopoly, and was used preferentially during the colonial times.}} created by the government of [[Peru]] in 1875 and operated by the [[Peruvian Nitrate Company]].&lt;ref&gt;David P. Werlich, ''Peru: A Shorty History'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1978), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Peru intended for the monopoly to capitalize on the world market's high demand for nitrates, thereby increasing the country's fiscal revenues and supplementing the financial role that [[guano]] sales had provided for the nation during the [[Guano Era]] (1840s-1860s).

During the 19th century Peru established a virtual international monopoly in the trade of guano, another [[fertilizer]], and since the 1840s income from this source had financed the Peruvian [[Guano Era]]. By the 1860s  these revenues were in decline, as deteriorating quality led to a reduction of exports. Alongside this trend, nitrate exports from the Peruvian province of [[Tarapacá Province (Peru)|Tarapacá]] grew, and became an important competitor to guano in the international market.&lt;ref name=Greenhill&gt;{{harvnb|Greenhill &amp; Miller|1973|}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|108}} In January 1873 the government of [[Manuel Pardo]] imposed an ''estanco'', a state control on production and sales of nitrate, but this proved impractical and the law was shelved in March 1873, before it was ever applied.

In 1875, as the economic situation deteriorated and Peru's overseas debts increased, the government expropriated the saltpeter industry and imposed a full state monopoly on production and exports.&lt;ref name=Greenhill/&gt; However, there were nitrate deposits in Bolivia and Chile, and although the latter were not economically viable, exports from Bolivia by the Chilean ''Compañía de Salitres y Ferrocarriles de Antofagasta'' (CSFA) made Peruvian price controls impossible. Following the Peruvian state's failure to raise new loan capital from Europe to finance its [[nationalization]] program, the government proceeded to acquire Bolivian licenses to exploit newly discovered nitrate fields, and encouraged the Bolivian government to withdraw from the [[Boundary Treaty of 1874 between Chile and Bolivia]]. This treaty had fixed for 25 years the tax rate on the Chilean saltpeter company, in return for Chile's relinquishing of its sovereignty claims over the disputed region of [[Antofagasta]].

In 1878 the Bolivian Government imposed a 0.35 Pounds Sterling per tonne (10 cents Bolivian Bolivianos per 100&amp;nbsp;kg){{refn|group=nota|name=10cents}} tax over the CSFA's export of saltpeter, contrary to Article IV of the Boundary Treaty. Although it is uncertain whether Peru exerted direct pressure on Bolivia to impose this tax, its consequence was the confiscation and auctioning off of the CSFA, the major competitor to Peruvian saltpeter. 

Historians agree that control over the nitrate fields in the [[Atacama]] were a central cause for the start of the [[War of the Pacific]].&lt;ref name="Reyes"&gt;Peruvian historian Alejandro Reyes Flores, ''Relaciones Internacionales en el Pacífico Sur'', in ''La Guerra del Pacífico'', Volume 1, Wilson Reategui, Alejandro Reyes &amp; others, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima 1979, page 110:
:"Jorge Basadre respecto a este problema económico crucial dice ''Al realizar el estado peruano con la ley del 28 de marzo de 1875, la expropiación y monopolio de las salitreras de Tarapacá, era necesario evitar la competencia de las salitreras del Toco [in Bolivia]...''. Aquí es donde se internacionalizaba el conflicto, pues estas salitreras, económicamente estaban en poder de chilenos y británicos"
:(transl.) Jorge Basadre states regarding this crucial economic issue: ''The Peruvian state, in carrying out the law of 28 March 1875, expropriated and monopolized the nitrate fields of Tarapaca, because it was necessary avoid the competition of the Toco's nitrate fields [in Bolivia], ...'' In this moment the [Peruvian debt] problem became international, because the nitrate fields were property of Chileans and British.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heraclio Bonilla, "La crisis de 1872", Ponencia presentada a la Comisión de Historia Económica del Congreso Nacional de Investigación Histórica organizada por el Concejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONCYTEC), Lima, 13 al 15 de noviembre de 1984, pág. 21-22:
:"Más bien, la cuestión del salitre, añadido a la cuestión de la deuda externa, se convertirá en un poderoso factor en el desencadenamiento de la guerra de 1879."
:(transl.)the saltpeter problem, added to the problem of the external debt became rather a mighty factor of unleashing the war&lt;/ref&gt; Some Chilean historians consider that the Peruvian plan to control the price and production of the Bolivian nitrate fields was what ultimately caused the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879-1883).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Contreras Carranza|2012|p=92}}:
:"El deseo de controlar también la producción del litoral boliviano condujo al Perú a una política de alianzas internacionales que desembocó en la guerra de 1879"
:(transl.)The quest to control also the production of the Bolivian litoral led Peru to a policy of international alliances which ended in the 1879 war"&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Chilean government, Peru's actions were the primary cause of the 1879 war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ravest Mora|2008|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most historians consider that the war was actually precipitated by the Chilean government's [[Chilean expansionism|expansionist]] foreign policy and its ambitions over the Atacama's mineral wealth in Bolivian and Peruvian territory.&lt;ref&gt;J.R.

Peru was rich in guano, a highly effective fertilizer because of its exceptionally high content of [[nitrate]]s, [[phosphate]]s and [[potassium]], which had since the 1840s provided the government with dramatically increasing revenues. To obtain the best possible price for the guano, the Peruvian state   established a system of [[consignment]] to private companies, to sell the product in Europe and the United States. The consignees were   important elements in the government's finances, because they delivered the cash and   credits for the government's spending. From the beginning of the guano exports  until 1869, the consignees were Peruvian traders.

In 1865 a [[coup d'etat]] brought a new Peruvian leader, [[Mariano Ignacio Prado]]. During his first administration (1865-1868) the finance minister, [[Manuel Pardo]] (later President of Peru  1872-1876), needed fresh revenues to replace the declining guano income, and imposed  new taxes  on saltpeter, wool, sugar, cotton, etc., as well as an inheritance and property transfer tax.   Opposition to the new taxes (see cartoons), combined with the weak Peruvian economy  and its bureaucratic inefficiency, the new taxes yielded  much less than expected. Prado resigned in 1868 and most of his new taxes were subsequently abolished.&lt;ref name="CCC"&gt;{{harvnb|Contreras Carranza|2012|}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|65;77–79}}

In July 1869 the new government contracted with a French businessman, [[Auguste Dreyfus]] to sell   two million tons of guano over a six-year period. This contract gave Peru   access to the international financial markets and enabled  President [[José Balta]] (1868-1872) to raise  loans of ₤36 millions  in Europe. However, the proceeds were spent on unprofitable public undertalings and prestige projects such as the sumptuous [[Palacio de la Exposición|Peruvian Exposition of 1872]]. As a result, Peru accumulated a large internal debt and a serious budget deficit. The quality and quantity of guano exports also declined over these years, and from the 1860s saltpeter exports  competed with guano in the international markets. Unlike the production and marketing of guano, which was in the hands of the government,  the saltpeter industry was privately owned and operated. In June 1876, the  Peruvian Guano Company{{refn|group=nota|Not to be confused with the [[Peruvian Corporation]], which administered some Peruvian debt bonds after the 1879 war.}}, owned by the Peruvian Raphael Holding, became the consignee for Europe through the [[Raphael Contract]].&lt;ref name="CCC"/&gt;{{rp|104}}

There are several benchmarks or dates for the crisis. The second administration of President Prado (1876-1879) had six [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Peru)|Finance Ministers]],  none of whom lasted a year. Contreras Carranza cites 1873  as marking the crisis. The Dreyfus organisation suspended the payment of guano export revenues to the Peruvian State, because all the money was spent in debt service.&lt;ref name="CCC"/&gt;{{rp|83, 101}} Guano exports fell from 575,000 tons in 1869 to less than 350,000 tons in 1873, and the [[Chincha Islands]] and other guano islands were depleted or almost depleted. Also, the quality (nitrogen content) of the guano fell.&lt;ref name=Greenhill/&gt;{{rp|112}} By  contrast, saltpeter was increasing its share in the export market: while some 1.7 million metric tonnes had been shipped from Tarapacá between 1860 and 1870, in the following decade the figure rose to over 4.4 million tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, "The Politics of Nitrate in Chile", p 288&lt;/ref&gt;

The falling income from guano was outweighed by the increasing volume of saltpeter sales and also by the increasing sugar exports;  Contreras states that the real cause of the crisis was the debt contracted in 1870-1872.&lt;ref name="CCC"/&gt;{{rp|102–103}} He specifies the failure of Balta's railroad plans as the origin of the disaster: from 1868 to 1875, 130 million soles were invested in eleven railroad lines, but only four were completed between  places of commercial importance, and only one of these according to plan. The annual revenue of 600,000 soles represented a yield of only one-tenth of the usual 5% or 6% per annum interest on South American investments at the time.&lt;ref name="CCC"/&gt;{{rp|121–125}}

=== Proposals ===
By 1872 the declining income from guano was insufficient to service state debts. On 28 September Manuel Pardo, now Peru's president,  announced in his inaugural address that the state was bankrupt and that he had to apply long-term solutions: administrative decentralization, an increase in customs duties, and an export duty on nitrate. He began his administration in the conditions he had warned about in 1866 when he was finance minister: rising debts and falling guano revenues.&lt;ref name="CCC"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

The discussion of Pardo's proposals produced two options for increasing revenue. The nitrate producers, who wanted to keep control over production volume and costs, favored a new tax on exports depending on the international price. A second idea, promoted by the guano traders who were eager to participate in the nitrate business, was to create a state monopoly on nitrate sales. An [[ad hoc]] senate committee advocated an export tax or, alternatively, a nationalization of the nitrate fields,&lt;ref name="CCC"/&gt;{{rp|87–88}} which would stop competition between the two fertilizers and bring the nitrate profit directly into the government treasury.

The guano traders, who had been displaced from the guano commerce by the Dreyfus Contract, were interested in a state control on the nitrate industry – control of production and output quotas, or even the expropriation of the ''salitreras'', in the hope of earning a greater part of the new lucrative business. They therefore supported the [[Civilista Party]], and its state control law (Ley del Estanco). The nitrate producers were represented&lt;ref name="CCC"/&gt;{{rp|106}} by [[Nicolas de Pierola]], who voiced a prevailing public mood against  the guano traders and the elite of Lima. Carlos Contreras writes:
:''Surgió una especie de odio social contra los consignatarios guaneros, los miembros del alto comercio y los dueños y directores de los bancos, personajes que solían entrelazarse o ser los mismos y estar vinculados casi todos ellos al partido civil a cuyos integrantes se les conoció como "la argolla". El caudillo arequipeño Piérola logró capitalizar el descontento contra esta oligarquía básicamente limeña ...''
:(transl.) ''It arose some kind of social hate against the guano consignees, the mighty traders, the owner and directors of banks, often related to each other or even the same persons, almost all of them were members of the Civilista Party, whose members were known as "La argolla" (Span. for "the ring") The [[caudillo]] from [[Arequipa]] Pierola reap benefits from dissatisfaction against this oligarchy from Lima ...''

[[Henry Meiggs]] also secretly supported Pierola's uprising against the government of Prado.&lt;ref name="Crozier 1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Crozier|1997|}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116}} (which provoked the [[Battle of Pacocha]] on 29 May 1877 between the Peruvian ship [[Huáscar (ship)|Huáscar]] and the British ship [[HMS Shah (1873)|HMS Shah]].)

As well as the new{{refn|group=nota|On 28 May 1828, a tax of 4% ad valorem was imposed on nitrate exports, but this was suppressed in 1849, imposed again in 1865 (7.50 soles per metric tonne) and suppressed again in 1868.&lt;ref name="CCC"&gt;{{harvnb|Contreras Carranza|2012|}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89}}&lt;ref name="Crozier 1997"/&gt;{{rp|58–59}} }} tax proposed by the senate committee, the government prepared to create a state monopoly of nitrate sales; the ''"Ley del Estanco"'' (Monopoly Law) was issued on 18 January 1873,&lt;ref&gt;Text of the law [http://www.leyes.congreso.gob.pe/Documentos/LeyesXIX/1873001.pdf Estanco del Salitre]&lt;/ref&gt; to become effective after two months. The Peruvian state would pay 24 soles per tonne{{refn|group=nota|Carlos Contreras Carranza states that 1875 the [[Peruvian sol (1863–1985)]] was worth 35 to 40 [[Penny|pence]] in 1875 but 22.5 to 29.5 pence in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Contreras Carranza|2012|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} to the producers, and if the nitrate sold for over 31 soles per tonne the state and the producers would share the profits. The law also set [[production quota]]s based on capacity and existing output. Unexploited saltpeter fields were transferred to the state, further private investments in the nitrate industry was forbidden. Four Peruvian banks, ''Nacional'', ''Providencial'', ''Perú'' and ''Lima'', would undertake the administration of the Monopoly Law.&lt;ref name="Greenhill"/&gt;{{rp|113}} Producers could export their product directly, but they had to pay  to the state the excess of any price over 31 soles per tonne.

As stated by the newspaper [[El Comercio (Peru)]] on 30 September 1872,   the new law would regulate  the nitrate supply, increase  the price,  eliminate  the competition between guano and salitre, and displace Chilean investors from Tarapaca.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Alejandro Salinas in ''Compendio de Historia económica del Perú'', Carlos Contreras (Editor), Volumen 4, page 360&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it threatened the independence of the producers, who had created their own [[enclave]] in a sparsely populated and infertile region physically isolated from the rest of Peru. The industry was largely organized by foreigners and net income went overseas. Materials, capital and equipment were brought from Valparaiso or Europe. The companies resented the allocation of quotas, and refused to co-operate. In February, in a "fear of gate closing", as firms raised output to increase their quotas, the saltpeter price fell to 18.70 soles per tonne, less than the government had promised to pay to the producers.

In March 1873 the government postponed the law, and in the autumn shelved the entire plan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leyes.congreso.gob.pe/Documentos/LeyesXIX/1873023.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Greenhill &amp; Miller cite as reasons for the project's failure the political crisis in Lima, high administrative costs, a lack of trained officials, and Valparaiso's strength as a sales center. Two measures survived the disaster: the export duties of 1.50 soles per tonne, and the "Compañía Administradora del Estanco del Salitre" to collect export duties.&lt;ref name="Greenhill"/&gt;{{rp|114–115}}

== Expropriation of the ''salitreras'' ==

The competition between guano and saltpeter sharpened and the state finances worsened, despite the fresh money from the saltpeter export tax.&lt;ref name=CCC/&gt;{{rp|93}}

On 28 May 1875 a Nationalization Law was issued; this stipulated that all the nitrate industry in Peru was to be expropriated and their owners compensated according to a property appraisal. For this purpose a loan of ₤7 million had to be raised in Europe. The new state "Compañía Salitrera del Perú" (from 1878 "Compañía Nacional del Salitre" under Banco de la Providencia) would supervise production, set output quotas and a ban on further investment was issued. Technically this was not a compulsory purchase; rather the law authorized the state to buy nitrate property. All owners had to continue the work of their ''oficinas'' for the government. Producers who opposed state interference or were confident in their abilities could continue to work in their properties, albeit under a higher export duty.

But Peru's (and South America's in general) lack of creditworthiness and the state of European money markets prevented Peru from raising the required £7 million loan in Europe; rather than paying in cash, the Peruvian state had to offer the mine owners two-year certificates bearing 8% interest and a 4% [[sinking fund]] in exchange for the properties, although some small ''salitreras'' were paid in cash.&lt;ref name="Contreras Carranza 2012 125"&gt;{{harvnb|Contreras Carranza|2012|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenhill"/&gt;{{rp|117}}

Greenhill &amp; Miller agree that "The severity of the financial crisis and the approaching termination of Pardo's presidency unduly hastened its completion."&lt;ref name="Greenhill"/&gt;{{rp|118–119}} Dishonest officials, lack of managerial expertise, unclear ownership rights, spurious claims of output and ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Basadre|1964|2235}} cites "la incuria, la ineptitud, la venalidad o el favoritismo&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, equal bonds were issued for different kind of properties (real estate, machines, spare parts, consumables), some bonds were made out to bearer or nominal [[payee]] and some bonds weren't assigned to a specific property.   This made possible speculation.&lt;ref name="Crozier 1997"/&gt;{{rp|109}}&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;{{harvnb|Gonzales Miranda|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the long delay (12 months) between proposing and implementing the expropriation encouraged abnormally high  output and consequently a low price of saltpeter, beside the [[Great Depression of British Agriculture]]. [[Anthony Gibbs and Sons]]'s ''"Compañía de Salitres de Tarapacá"'' got a "good, even inflated price" for its nitrate properties and Crozier remarks that they were ready to work for the government only for the profit derived from the iodine production, a fact that was unknown to the Peruvian government.&lt;ref name="Crozier 1997"/&gt;{{rp|109–110}}

== Quest for control of Bolivian nitrate ==
{{POV section|date=November 2016}}

The ''Compañía de Salitres y Ferrocarriles de Antofagasta'' (CSFA) was a Chilean company, based in [[Valparaiso]]; a 29% minority share was held by the British [[Anthony Gibbs and Sons]]. From the 1860s the company had exploited the nitrate fields in Antofagasta, with a [[tax exemption]] license of the Bolivian government.&lt;ref name="Crozier 1997"/&gt;{{rp|99–100}} Beyond that, article IV of the Boundary Treaty between Chile and Bolivia of 1874 explicitly ruled out new or higher taxes upon Chilean companies or persons working in Antofagasta. The CSFA was the only competitor of Peruvian saltpeter in the international markets, and the urgent necessity to maintain the prices of saltpeter and guano brought the Peruvian government to intervene actively in the Bolivian saltpeter policy.

On February 6, 1873, a few days after the signing of the ''Ley del Estanco'', the Peruvian senate approved the [[Secret treaty of alliance between Peru and Bolivia of 1873|secret treaty of alliance between Peru and Bolivia]]; the parliamentary proceedings have disappeared since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Basadre|1964|p=2278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peruvian historian [[Jorge Basadre]] asserts that the two projects were unrelated to each other, but Hugo Pereira Plascencia has contributed several items of evidences to the contrary: in 1873 the Italian author Pietro Perolari–Malmignati cited the Peruvian interest in defending its saltpeter monopoly against the Chilean production in Bolivia as the main cause of the secret treaty, and also said that the Peruvian Foreign Minister, [[José de la Riva-Agüero y Looz Corswaren|José de la Riva-Agüero]] informed the Chilean Minister in Lima, Joaquín Godoy, about negotiations with Bolivia to expand the ''estanco'' in Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Pereira Plascencia, [http://blog.pucp.edu.pe/blog/hpereyra/2014/12/31/la-pol-tica-salitrera-del-presidente-manuel-pardo-el-tratado-chileno-boliviano-de-1874-su-violaci-n-y-el-comienzo-de-la-guerra-del-pac-fico/ La política salitrera del presidente Manuel Pardo]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 the Peruvian government bought the saltpeter licenses for "El Toco" fields in Bolivia through an intermediary, [[Henry Meiggs]], the builder of the Peruvian railroads, but also with the involvement of Anthony Gibbs and Sons, the company that would owe Bolivia for the licenses. The picturesque agreement, as Crozier called it, about property would have long standing consequences; it was called "Caso Squire" in the Chilean courts after the war.&lt;ref name="Crozier 1997"/&gt;{{rp|116}}

In 1876 President Pardo urged Gibbs to ensure the success of the monopoly by limiting the production of the CSFA, and in 1878, Anthony Gibbs and Sons warned the management board of the CSFA that they would get trouble with a "neighbouring Government" [sic] if they insisted on swamping the market with their nitrate.&lt;ref name="Ravest"&gt;Manuel Ravest Mora, ''[http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0717-71942008000100003 La Casa Gibbs y el Monopolio Salitrero Peruano, 1876-1878]'', Historia N°41, vol. I, enero-junio 2008: 63-77, ISSN 0073-2435&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|69}}

Bolivian historian Querejazu cited George Hicks, manager of the Chilean CSFA, who knew that the highest bidder for the confiscated property of the CSFA on 14 February 1879 would be the Peruvian consul in Antofagasta.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Querejazu|1979|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anthony Gibbs and Sons, represented in South America by (Williams or) Guillermo Gibbs &amp; Cia. of Valparaiso, had much more important investments in Peru than in Chile. In Peru, the House of Gibbs owned of 58% of the ''Compañía de Salitres de Tarapacá''&lt;ref name="Crozier 1997"/&gt;{{rp|82}} ("Tarapaca Nitrate Company") and had been guano consignee of the government in Europe.&lt;ref name="Greenhill"/&gt;{{rp|120–121}}

=== The Bolivian ten cents tax ===

On 14 February 1878, the Bolivian senate enacted a new tax of 7 shillings{{refn |group=nota |name=10cents |The name of the Bolivian currency at the time was "Boliviano" (Spanish for "Bolivian") and tax was 10 cents Boliviano per quintal métrico, i.e. 100 kg. In 1878 10 Bolivian cents were equal to roughly 3.7 pence, so the tax amounted to 7 shillings per ton. As the price of nitrate was 10.6 pounds sterling per ton, the tax was equivalent to about 3% ad valorem.&lt;ref name="FIW"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sicotte |first1=Richard |last2=Vizcarra |first2=Catalina |last3=Wandschneider |first3=Kirsten |title=The fiscal impact of the War of the Pacific |date=2009 |publisher=Springer Verlag |page=101 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} per metric tonne on the export of nitrate. The CSFA refused to pay the new tax because of article 4 of the Border Treaty and the License. In February 1879, the Bolivian government retired the license of exploitation and confiscated the property of the company.

On 14 February 1879, Chilean troops occupied the port of Antofagasta, which was populated by a majority of Chileans. Bolivia declared war on Chile on 1 March 1879. Peru, allied with Bolivia under the secret treaty, pretended to mediate, but as the Chilean government asked Peru to declare its neutrality, Peru tried to delay negotiations. Chile declared war on Peru and Bolivia on 5 April.

Ronald Bruce St John put it in the following words:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|St John|1992|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Although persuasive evidence linking Peru to either the ten centavos tax or Bolivia's decision to confiscate Chilean holdings in Antofagasta never surfaced, it must be recognized that Peruvian interests had deep-seated economical and political reasons for going to war."

== War of the Pacific ==
{{main article|War of the Pacific}}

[[File:Salida-de-chilenos-de-Iquique.png|thumb|right|300px|At the outset of the war, about 30,000 Chilean workers had to leave Peru within 8 days. Later the Chilean Navy blockaded and shelled the port. The lack of workers and the blockade disrupted the operations of the saltpeter industry. [[La Ilustración Española y Americana]] published on 15 June 1879 an image (of April 1879) of Chileans waiting at the port of [[Iquique]] for ships to return home.]]

In November 1879, during the [[Tarapacá Campaign]], the Chilean Army seized the Peruvian ''salitreras'' and most of the guano deposits, whose export ports were already under blockade by the Chilean Navy. On 12 September 1879, five months after beginning of the war, the Chilean government had imposed a tax of 4 [[Chilean peso]]s{{refn|group=nota|Chilean historian Wilhelm Ekdahl states that 1 peso chileno was equivalent to 30 pence in his "[https://issuu.com/albedu/docs/ekdahl__wilhelm_-_historia_militar_de_la_guerra_de Historia Militar de la Guerra del Pacífico]", Tomo I, page 28}} per [[metric ton]] upon Antofagasta's export of saltpeter to finance the war effort, despite protest by the Chilean CSFA.

After the occupation of Tarapaca, the Chilean government had to decide what to do with the nitrate industry. They had two alternatives: to follow Peru's way, i.e. to pay the Peruvian debt certificates (₤ 4 Millions&lt;ref name="WED"/&gt;{{rp|28}}) and create a state company to manage the production and marketing of nitrate; or to return the property to the holder of nitrate certificates and let them restart the business. The Chilean government decided on the latter course: on Juni 11 1881 (provisionally) and on 28 March 1882 (definitively) they allowed the bondholders to retake their properties and continue the exploitation.&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;{{harvnb|Gonzales Miranda|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to [[privatization]] has been much criticized and Chile lamented for having been duped into losing her economic future to the hands of "predatory" capitalists. But William Edmundson states:
:''But it is difficult to see what else the Chilean government could have done in the current circumstances. There was an urgent need to revive nitrate exports as soon as possible in order to help to pay off the costs of the ongoing conflict.''

He cites the catastrophic Peruvian attempt, the uncertainty over the property rights, the immense fiscal and bureaucratic burden, and that for the public opinion in Chile "government ownership of the means of production was regarded as beyond the ideological pale".&lt;ref name="WED"&gt;William Edmondson, The Nitrate King, ''A Biography of "Colonel" John Thomas North''&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27–28}}

The [[Treaty of Ancon]] in 1883 formally ceded Tarapacá to Chile and finished the Peruvian control over the nitrate fields. But the court proceedings in Peru, Chile and Europe about property rights and debts continued until 1920.

== Aftermath ==
{{POV section|date=November 2016}}

Historians agree that the monopoly did not meet the expectations set out in the law of 1875, and that the same or higher revenues could have been obtained with a simple export tax.&lt;ref name="Contreras Carranza 2012 125"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenhill &amp; Miller|1973|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harvnb|Basadre|1964"&gt;{{harvnb|Basadre|1964|}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2235}}

According to Carlos Contreras Carranza, there are two views on the law's significance for Peru. While some authors consider that the war interrupted a fiscal reform which was not irrevocably doomed to fail, other historians see it as yet another improvised policy, which the easy guano revenues had generated.&lt;ref name="CCC"/&gt;{{rp|129}} In the former view, the nationalization was the birth of a new [[bourgeoisie]], national and progressive; in the latter view it was an abortion of a new bourgeoisie of Tarapacá, expropriated and displaced from the business in favor of Lima's old elite, accustomed to enriching themselves from state economy.&lt;ref name="CCC"/&gt;{{rp|96}}

On the eve of the war, [[Guillermo Billinghurst]], then a member of the Peruvian senate and later president of Peru, advocated the restitution of the ''salitreras'' to the former owners, but the outbreak of war made a discussion impossible.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Basadre|1964"/&gt;{{rp|2236}}

In 1890 the Peruvian government approved a settlement, known as the [[Grace Contract]], which resulted in the holders of Peruvian sovereign debt taking control of the country's railroads. The government did not issue new sovereign debt until 1906.&lt;ref name="SVW"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sicotte|first1=Richard|last2=Vizcarra|first2=Catalina|last3=Wandschneider|first3=Kirsten|title=Military Conquest and Sovereign Debt: Chile, Peru and the London Bond Market, 1876-1890|date=2009|publisher=University of Vermont|page=42|url=https://www.uvm.edu/~econ/documents/SVWRevisionfinal.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the origins of the War of the Pacific are closely related to saltpeter, Peruvian historiography has been reluctant to review the issue.&lt;ref name="Documento de trabajo 216"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Contreras Carranza| first1=Carlos| title=La teoría de la dependencia en la historia económica de la república| url=http://www.pucp.edu.pe/economia/pdf/DDD216.pdf| website=Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú| accessdate=22 August 2016 |page=12}}:
: ''Aunque los orígenes de la guerra con Chile estuvieron tan íntimamente ligados a la cuestión del salitre, el tema de la política salitrera del gobierno peruano durante la década de 1870 ha sido particularmente esquivado por la historiografía peruana.''&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this attitude, the Bolivian historian said that "it is a egregious lie that Peru went to war only to help Bolivia".&lt;ref&gt;Querejazu, "Guano, Salitre y Sangre", versión pdf, pág. 439: 
:''infundio de que el Perú ingresó a la guerra nada más que por ayudar a Bolivia.''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Chile possessed all guano and saltpeter fields of the Pacific Coast of South America, but never built a state monopoly. Nonetheless, its control gave the country a virtual monopoly of nitrates, and the income acquired from its taxation allowed the country to fund its development. During the 20th century, Chile would further exploit the Atacama's mineral wealth by [[Chilean nationalization of copper|nationalizing the copper industry]].

It is through the performance of this function that individuals are inducted into the political culture and their orientations towards political objects are formed.&lt;ref&gt;Varkey, K. (2003).

==Agents of socialization==
Agents of socialization, sometimes referred to as [[institution]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, work together to influence and shape people's political and economic norms and values. Such institutions include, but are not limited to: [[Family|families]], [[Media (communication)|media]], [[Peer group|peers]], [[School|schools,]] [[religion]]s, work and [[legal systems]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Agents===
# '''Family''': Families perpetuate values that support political authorities and can heavily contribute to children's initial political ideological views, or party affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=VENTURA|first=RAPHAEL|date=2016|title=Family Political Socialization in Multiparty Systems|url=|journal=Comparative Political Studies|volume= 34| issue = 6|pages=666–691|doi=10.1177/0010414001034006004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Families have an effect on "political knowledge, identification, efficacy, and participation", depending on variables such as "family demographics, life cycle, parenting style, parental level of political cynicism and frequency of political discussions."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kononova|first=A.|last2=Saleem|first2=A.|date=2011|title=The role of media in the process of socialization to American politics among international students.|url=|journal=International Communication Gazette|volume= 73| issue = 4|pages=302–321|doi=10.1177/1748048511398592}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# '''Schools''': Spending numerous years in school, children in the United States are taught and reinforced a view of the world that "privileges capitalism and ownership, competitive individualism, and democracy."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through primary, secondary and high schools, students are taught key principles such as individual rights and property, personal responsibility and duty to their nation. 
# '''Media:''' Mass media is not only a source of political information; it is an influence on political values and beliefs. Various media outlets, through news coverage and late-night programs, provide different partisan policy stances that are associated with political participation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# '''Religion''': Religions beliefs and practices play a role in political opinion formation and political participation. The theological and moral perspectives offered by religious institutions shape judgement regarding public policy, and ultimately, translates to direct "political decision making on governmental matters such as the redistribution of wealth, equality, tolerance for deviance and the limits on individual freedom, the severity of criminal punishment, policies relating to family structure, gender roles, and the value of human life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195326529.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195326529-e-6|title=Religion and Political Socialization|last=Pearson‐Merkowitz|first=Shanna|last2=Gimpel|first2=James G.|date=2009-08-19|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195326529.003.0006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Political parties]]''': Scholars such as Campbell (1960) note that political parties have very little direct influence on a child due to a contrast of social factors such as age, context, power, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. M. (1960). The American Voter. New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
#  '''The state''': The state is a key source of information for media outlets, and has the ability to "inform, misinform, or disinform the press and thus the public", a strategy which may be referred to as [[propaganda]], in order to serve a political or economic agenda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Media's effect ==

=== In children ===
Political socialization begins in childhood. Some research suggests that family and school teachers are the most influential factors in socializing children, but recent research designs have more accurately estimated the high influence of the media in the process of political socialization. On average, both young children and teenagers in the United States spend more time a week consuming television and digital media than they spend in school. Young children consume an average of thirty-one hours a week, while teenagers consume forty-eight hours of media a week. High school students attribute the information that forms their opinions and attitudes about race, war, economics, and patriotism to mass media much more than their friends, family, or teachers. Research has also shown that children who consume more media than others show greater support for and understanding of American values, such as free speech. This may be because eighty percent of the media content children consume is intended for an adult audience. In addition, the impact of the messages is more powerful because children's brains are "prime for learning", thus more likely to take messages and representations of the world at face value.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris|publisher = CQ Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-8728-7|location = |pages = |last2 = Dunaway|first2 = Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In adulthood ===
Media's role into political socialization continues in adulthood through both fictional and factual media sources. Adults have increased exposure to news and political information embedded in entertainment; fictional entertainment (mostly television) is the most common source for political information. The culmination of information gained from entertainment becomes the values and standards by which people judge.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014" /&gt;

While political socialization by the media is lifelong process, after adolescence, people's basic values generally do not change. Most people choose what media they are exposed to based on their already existing values, and they use information from the media to reaffirm what they already believe. Studies show two-thirds of newspaper readers do not know their newspaper's position on specific issues- and most media stories are quickly forgotten. Studies on public opinion of the Bush administration's energy policies show that the public pays more attention to issues that receive a lot of media coverage, and forms collective opinions about these issues. This demonstrates that the mass media attention to an issue affects public opinion. More so, extensive exposure to television has led to "mainstreaming", aligning people's perception of political life and society with television's portrayal of it.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014" /&gt;

=== Patterns ===
There are different patterns in socialization based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, income, education, geographic region, and city size. For example, generally, African Americans and Hispanics rely on television for their information more than white people. More women than men watch daytime television, and more men than women follow sports programs. Older people read more newspapers than younger people, and people from the ages of twelve to seventeen (although they consume the most media) consume the least amount of news. Northerners listen to radio programs more than Southerners do. News outlets on the East Coast tend to cover international affairs in Europe and the Middle East the most, while West Coast news outlets are more likely to cover Asian affairs; this demonstrates that region affects patterns in media socialization. Income level is also an important factor; high-income families rely more on print media than television, and consume less television than most of the population.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014" /&gt;

Ultimately, however, the common core of information, and the interpretation the media applies to it, leads to a shared knowledge and basic values throughout the United States. Most media entertainment and information does not vary much throughout the country, and it is consumed by all types of audiences. Although there are still disagreements and different political beliefs and party affiliations, generally there are not huge ideological disparities among the population because the media helps create a broad consensus on basic US democratic principles.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4121">"'''Question authority'''" is a popular slogan often used on [[bumper sticker]]s, T-shirts and as [[graffiti]]. The slogan was popularized by controversial [[psychologist]] [[Timothy Leary]],&lt;ref name=pppqpvab51&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SoLjB4x0hMoC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=question+authority+socrates+timothy+leary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=my0n2gpUhD&amp;sig=H5q0ynWp7zEOYW50j2p-exYZE8M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=puF3U9KjLsScyATV1YDQAw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=question%20authority%20socrates%20timothy%20leary&amp;f=false|title=Question Authority; Think for Yourself|author1=Beverly Potter|author2=Mark Estren|publisher=Ronin Publishing|page=22|year=2012|isbn=1579511627|accessdate=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some people have suggested that the idea behind the slogan can be traced back to the ancient [[Greek philosopher]] [[Socrates]].&lt;ref&gt;http://radicalreference.info/node/832&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential icons in the [[counterculture movement]] which formed in the late 1960s out of opposition to the [[Vietnam War]]'s escalation, Leary gained influence among much of the youth by advocating the use of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] – which was criminalized in the [[United States]] in 1966&lt;ref name=pppqpvab287 /&gt; –  as a way to escape from the burdens of society.&lt;ref name=pppqpvab287&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sixties Chronicle|author=David Farber|publisher=Legacy Publishing|page=287|year=2004|isbn=141271009X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Watergate Scandal]], which resulted in the resignation of [[US President]] [[Richard Nixon]] and the conviction of several officials in the Nixon administration, the slogan became arguably the most accepted form of ideology among [[baby boomers]].&lt;ref name=pppqpvab48&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sixties Chronicle|author=David Farber|publisher=Legacy Publishing|page=448|year=2004|isbn=141271009X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is intended to encourage people to avoid fallacious [[argument from authority|appeals to authority]].  The term has always symbolized the necessity of paying attention to the rules and regulations promulgated by a government unto its citizenry.  However, psychologists have also criticized Leary's method of questioning authority and have argued that it resulted in widespread [[Manifest and latent functions and dysfunctions#Dysfunctions|dysfunctionality]].&lt;ref name=uoooa&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SoLjB4x0hMoC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=question+authority+socrates+timothy+leary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=my0n2gpUhD&amp;sig=H5q0ynWp7zEOYW50j2p-exYZE8M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=puF3U9KjLsScyATV1YDQAw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=question%20authority%20socrates%20timothy%20leary&amp;f=false|title=Question Authority; Think for Yourself|author1=Beverly Potter|author2=Mark Estren|publisher=Ronin Publishing|page=23|year=2012|isbn=1579511627|accessdate=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In their book ''Question Authority, Think For Yourself'', psychologists Beverly Potter and Mark Estren alleged that the practice of Leary's philosophy enhances a person's self-interest and greatly weakens the ability to cooperate with others.

However, this was foreseen in concept by C. Wright Mills in his 1956 book, ''The Power Elite''. quoting:
"“Authority ''formally'' resides ‘in the people,’ but the power of initiation is in fact held by small circles of men. That is why the standard strategy of manipulation is to make it appear that the people, or at least a large group of them, ‘really made the decision.’ That is why even when authority is available, men with access to it may still prefer the secret, quieter ways of manipulation.”  Mills noted earlier that "It is in this mixed case—as in the intermediate reality of the American today—that manipulation is a prime way of exercising power."

'''Robert Laird Harris''' (March 10, 1911 – April 25, 2008) was a [[Presbyterian]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]], church leader, and [[Old Testament]] [[scholarship|scholar]].

==Biography==
Harris was born near [[Upper Makefield Township, Pennsylvania]]. He earned a [[B.S.]] from the [[University of Delaware]] (1931), a [[Th.B.]] (1935) and a [[Th.M.]] (1937) from [[Westminster Theological Seminary]], an [[Master of Arts#North America|A.M.]] from [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1941), and a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Dropsie College]] (1947).

He was licensed as a minister in the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] in 1935, joined the newly formed [[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]] in 1936, then teamed up with those forming the [[Bible Presbyterian Church]] in 1937, and was in 1956 moderator of a new offshoot [[religious denomination|denomination]], the Bible Presbyterian Synod (BPS). He was involved on the committee that brought about the merger of the BPS with another [[religious denomination|denomination]] to become the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod]] (RPCES) in 1965, and then the RPCES, along with its education institutions [[Covenant College]] and [[Covenant Theological Seminary]], became part of the [[Presbyterian Church in America]] in 1982, at which time Harris was elected moderator of the 10th [[Presbyterian polity|General Assembly]] of that body.

He was part-time instructor in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at the University of Pennsylvania (1946–1947) and then taught for twenty years at Faith Theological Seminary (1937–1956). He resigned from that institution because of his belief in the propriety of denomination-controlled institutions, and he then helped found the [[Covenant Theological Seminary]], which was a denominational institution and where he was chairman of the [[Old Testament]] department until he retired in 1981. Harris served as Professor of Old Testament as [[adjunct professor]] at [[Knox Theological Seminary]] at its founding in 1989. He was actively involved with the development of the Old Testament department there, teaching Hebrew, Hebrew Exegesis, the Pentateuch, and Survey through 1993.&lt;ref name="Knox Theological Seminary"&gt;{{cite web | title=Home Page | website=Knox Theological Seminary | url=https://www.knoxseminary.edu/ | access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris's first wife, Elizabeth K. Nelson, was born on April 30, 1910 and died in 1980. He then married Anne P. Krauss and lived in [[Quarryville, Pennsylvania]].

==Publications==
Harris published several books including ''Introductory Hebrew Grammar'', ''Inspiration and Canonicity of the Bible'', ''Your Bible'', and ''Man—God's Eternal Creation''

He also served as editor of ''The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament'' and was a contributing editor to the ''Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible''. He was contributed articles to the ''Wycliffe Bible Commentary'' and the ''Expositor's Bible'', and he served as chairman of the Committee on Bible Translation for the [[New International Version]].

{{Politics of Catalonia}}

The party was founded in March 1931 as the union of the independentist [[Estat Català]] (''Catalan State''), led by [[Francesc Macià]], the [[Catalan Republican Party]], led by [[Lluís Companys]] and the ''L'Opinió'' Group of [[Joan Lluhí i Vallescà]]. The party had done extremely well in the municipal elections of 12 April 1931. Two days later, on 14 April, few hours before the proclamation of the Spanish Republic in [[Madrid]], Macià declared in [[Barcelona]] that [[Catalonia]] would become an [[Catalan State (1931)|independent republic]] within the Iberian Federation. This was not exactly what had been agreed in the [[Pact of San Sebastián]], so three days later they negotiated with the Madrid government that Macià would become [[president]] of the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]], an autonomous Catalan government within the new [[Spanish Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Battle for Spain" Beevor (2006) p.25&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1932, the Spanish Republican Cortes approved the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1932|Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]] which, among other provisions, granted a [[Catalan Parliament]] with full legislative powers, and [[Catalan regional election, 1932|it was elected on 20 November 1932]]. The Republican Left of Catalonia won a large majority of seats.

On 6 October 1934, Lluís Companys, elected by the Parliament of Catalonia as new President of the Generalitat after the death of Francesc Macià in December 1933, unlawfully declared a [[Catalan State (1934)|Catalan State]] within a ''Spanish Federal Republic'', following the entry of right-wing ministers of the [[Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups|Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] (CEDA) into the Government of the Spanish Republic. considered close to fascism and, therefore, they feared that it was the first step of this party to suppress the autonomy and take the complete power in Spain. The proclamation was quickly suppressed by the Spanish army, and Catalan Government were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Finestres| first1=Jordi| last2=López| first2=Manel| title = Entre la revolució i l'estelada| year=2014| publisher=Sàpiens| location=Barcelona| language=Catalan| issn=1695-2014|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party leaders (including Companys itself) and the Catalan Government were sentenced by the Spanish Republic and jailed, and the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia was suspended until February 1936.

In 1936, at the dawn of the [[Spanish Civil War]], ERC decided to become part of the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] to contest that year's election, which it won. Esquerra became the leading force of the ''Popular Front'' in Catalonia and during the war tried to maintain the unity of the Front in the face of growing tensions between the [[POUM|Workers' Party of Marxist Unification]] (POUM) and the pro-soviet [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]] (PSUC).

The party was declared illegal (along with all other participants in the ''Popular Front'') by [[Francisco Franco]] after he came to power in 1939. The former president of the Catalan [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Generalitat]], [[Lluís Companys]], was arrested by German agents {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} in collaboration with [[Vichy France]], returned to Spain and executed on 15 October 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul (2012).

The party is also federated with parties in the [[Balearic Islands]] and in [[Northern Catalonia]] in France, as well as with [[Republican Left of the Valencian Country]] in the [[Valencian Community]]. Except for their Balearic counterpart, none of the latter currently have any parliamentary representation in their respective territories, though they do have 8 municipal councillors in the Balearic Islands&lt;ref name=argos&gt;[http://www.argos.gva.es/ahe/pls/argos_elec/DMEDB_ElecComunidades.informeElecDetallado?aNComuId=4&amp;aNNumElec=1&amp;aVTipoElec=L&amp;aVFechaElec=2011&amp;aVLengua=v. Dades electorals detallades de les Eleccions Locals 2011], arxiu històric electora, accessed 28 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and 6 councillors in the Valencian Community.&lt;ref name=argos /&gt;

==Political principles and representation==
Its basic political principles are defined in the Statement of Ideology approved at the 19th National Congress in 1993.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} This is organised into the three areas that give the organisation its name: [[Left-wing politics|Esquerra]] (commitment to the Left's agenda in the political debate), [[Republic|República]] (commitment to the Republican form of government vs. Spain's current [[constitutional monarchy]]) and [[Catalonia|Catalunya]] ([[Catalan independentism]], which, as understood by ERC, comprises the [[Catalan Countries]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Despite having been one of the main forces behind the movement for amendment, the party eventually opposed the 2006 changes to the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia|Catalan Statute of Autonomy]] to increase Catalonia's autonomy. It did so on the grounds that it did not do enough to increase Catalan independence. This caused a government crisis with its partners (specially with the [[Partit dels Socialistes de Catalunya]], PSC) which led to an [[Catalan Parliament election, 2006|early election in 2006]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

''Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya'' has 21 seats in the [[Catalan Parliament]], suffering a dramatic setback after the [[Catalan regional election, 2010|2010 Catalan parliamentary election]] and an equally dramatic gain in [[Catalan regional election, 2012|2012]], and one seat in the [[Parliament of the Balearic Islands|Balearic Parliament]]. Until 2010, it was one of the three coalition members of the tripartite left-wing [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan Government]], together with [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia]] (PSC) and [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens]] (ICV). The coalition was often uneasy due to tensions related to the new [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]]. The snap election on November 25, 2012 saw ERC rise to a total of 21 seats in the Catalan Parliament.

Out of [[Catalonia]], it has nine seats (fifth largest group by seats) in the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish Parliament]] and two seats in the [[European Parliament]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4132">'''Rightful Resistance''' is a form of partially institutionalized popular contention against the state whereby aggrieved citizens seek to legitimize their causes by making use of state's own laws, policies or rhetoric in framing their protests. Rightful resistance is contrasted with other forms of popular protest where citizens challenge the legitimacy of rulers; the rightful resister accepts the legitimacy of laws, policies and core values of the state, but protests when they perceive that authorities have failed to deliver on their own promises, or have defied the laws or widely accepted values. Rightful resisters are characterized by the peaceful nature of their protests, which often make use of institutionalized channels of dissent. Unlike more conventional resisters who may employ covert or quiet means of sabotage against the state, rightful resisters actively seek the attention of the elites, and their protests are public and open.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. O'Brien, "Rightful Resistance," World Politics Journal, Volume 49, Number 1, October 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept was first explained by the political scientist Kevin O'Brien in the 1996 article ''Rightful Resistance'', which focused on its applications in rural [[People's Republic of China|China]], as well as in a variety of other political settings, including the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]]. The concept was elaborated on in O'Brien and Lianjiang Li's 2006 book ''Rightful Resistance in Rural China,''&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. O'Brien and Li Lianjiang, "Rightful Resistance in Rural China." Cambridge University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been adopted by a number of other social change theorists to describe the methods by which citizens may gradually seek to advance their rights and interests.

==Example of Rightful Resistance==

===China===
{{Weiquan_Lawyers}}
The concept of rightful resistance devised by O'Brien was initially used to describe protest actions adopted in [[rural China]], where citizens confront a range of grievances stemming from official corruption, environmental pollution, predatory taxes, and economic misappropriation, among others. As the "rights consciousness" of Chinese citizens grew in the era of [[Deng Xiaoping]] and onward, citizens began making use of [[Petitioning (China)|petitioning]] channels, the legal system, and of central government directives to hold local-level authorities to account. To illustrate, O'Brien provides the example of a group of villagers in [[Henan]] province facing excessive taxes from local authorities. In response, the villages presented authorities with a copy of central government regulations which prescribed strict limits of taxes, and threatened that if the local authorities failed to drop the excessive taxes, they would take their complaints up the ladder.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rightful resistance in China is manifest in a variety of other ways, include use of the petitioning system, village elections, and legal system to seek redress against grievances. [[Weiquan movement|Weiquan]] (rights defending) lawyers, who regularly defy authorities by defending individuals whose human or civil rights have been violated by the party-state, have been described as engaging in a form of rightful resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Pils, "The practice of law as conscientious resistance: Chinese weiquan lawyers' experience," in Impact of China's 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, Jean-Philippe Beja (ed) (Routledge, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Weiquan lawyers typically frame their arguments by making appeals to [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|China's constitution]], arguing that abuses of human rights—sanctioned as they may be by the state—are in contravention of the country's laws.&lt;ref&gt;Keith J. Hand. "Using Law for a Righteous Purpose: The Sun Zhigang Incident and Evolving Forms of Citizen Action in the People's Republic of China." Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, Issue 45 (2006), pp. 114-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''riot''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|aɪ|ə|t|}}) is a form of [[civil disorder]] commonly characterized by a group lashing out in a violent public disturbance against [[authority]], [[property]] or [[people]]. Riots typically involve [[theft]], [[vandalism]], and destruction of property, public or private. The property targeted varies depending on the riot and the inclinations of those involved. Targets can include shops, cars, restaurants, state-owned institutions, and religious buildings.&lt;ref name="Braha, D. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Braha, D.|year=2012|title=Global Civil Unrest: Contagion, Self-Organization, and Prediction|volume=7|issue=10|page=e48596|url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0048596|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0048596|journal=PLoS ONE|pmid=23119067|pmc=3485346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riots often occur in reaction to a [[grievance]] or out of [[dissent]]. Historically, riots have occurred due to poor working or [[quality of life|living conditions]], governmental [[oppression]], [[taxation]] or [[conscription]], conflicts between [[ethnic group]]s, ([[race riot]]) or religions ([[sectarian violence]], [[pogrom]]), the outcome of a sporting event ([[sports riot]], [[football hooliganism]]) or frustration with legal channels through which to air grievances.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph.|date=June 2014}}

While individuals may attempt to lead or control a riot, riots typically consist of disorganized groups that are frequently "chaotic and exhibit [[herd behavior]]."&lt;ref name="Braha, D. 2012"/&gt; However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that riots are not irrational, herd-like behavior, but actually follow inverted social norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/19/riots-psychology-crowds|title=You won't prevent future riots by disregarding the psychology of crowds|work=The Guardian|date=Aug 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. S. Ashton]], in his study of food riots among [[Colliery|colliers]], noted that "the turbulence of the colliers is, of course, to be accounted for by something more elementary than politics: it was the instinctive reaction of virility to hunger."&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, T. S., and Joseph Sykes. 1967. ''The Coal Industry of the Eighteenth Century''. 2d ed. New York: A. M. Kelley. p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. H. Wilson (historian)|Charles Wilson]] noted, "Spasmodic rises in food prices provoked keelmen on the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] to riot in 1709, tin miners to plunder granaries at [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in 1727."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=E.P. Thompson|title=The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century|work=Past and Present|volume=50|date=Feb 1971|page=77|jstor=650244|subscription=yes|doi=10.1093/past/50.1.76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=May 2014}}

Today, some rioters have an improved understanding of the tactics used by police in riot situations. Manuals for successful rioting are available on the internet, with tips such as encouraging rioters to get the press involved, as there is more safety and attention with the cameras rolling. Citizens with [[video camera]]s may also have an effect on both rioters and police.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Dealing with riots is often a difficult task for police forces. They may use [[tear gas]] or [[CS gas]] to control rioters. Riot police may use [[less-than-lethal]] methods of control, such as shotguns that fire [[flexible baton round]]s to injure or otherwise incapacitate rioters for easier arrest.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Classification==
[[File:Tompkins square riot 1874.jpg|thumbnail|New York police violently attacking unemployed workers in [[Tompkins Square Riot (1874)|Tompkins Square Park]], 1874.]]
A '''[[police riot]]''' is a term for the disproportionate and unlawful use of force by a group of police against a group of civilians. This term is commonly used to describe a police attack on peaceful civilians, or provoking peaceful civilians into violence.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

A '''[[prison riot]]''' is a large-scale, temporary act of concerted defiance or disorder by a group of prisoners against prison administrators, prison officers, or other groups of prisoners. It is often done to express a grievance, force change or attempt escape.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In a '''[[race riot]]''', race or ethnicity is the key factor. The term had entered the English language in the United States by the 1890s. Early use of the term referred to riots that were often a mob action by members of a majority racial group against people of other perceived races.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In a '''[[religious riot]]''', the key factor is [[religion]]. The rioting mob targets people and properties of a specific religion, or those believed to belong to that religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/07/03/india.pig.religious.riot/index.html|work=CNN|title=Thrown pig leads to religious riots in India|accessdate=May 22, 2010|date=July 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Student riot]]s''' are riots precipitated by students, often in higher education, such as a college or university. Student riots in the US and Western Europe in the 1960s and the 1970s were often political in nature. Student riots may also occur as a result of oppression of peaceful demonstration or after sporting events. Students may constitute an active political force in a given country. Such riots may occur in the context of wider political or social grievances.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

'''[[Urban riots]]''' are riots in the context of urban decay, provoked by conditions such as discrimination, poverty, high unemployment, poor schools, poor healthcare, housing inadequacy and police brutality and bias. Urban riots are closely associated with [[race riots]] and [[police riot]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

'''[[Sports riot]]s''' such as the [[Nika riots]] can be sparked by the losing or winning of a specific team or athlete. Fans of the two teams may also fight. Sports riots may happen as a result of teams contending for a championship, a long series of matches, or scores that are close. Sports are the most common cause of riots in the United States, accompanying more than half of all championship games or series.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Almost all sports riots occur in the winning team's city.&lt;ref name="ballard20111226"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?urlID=467201362&amp;action=cpt&amp;partnerID=289881|title=The Kiss|work=Sports Illustrated|date=2011-12-26|accessdate=December 24, 2011|author=Ballard, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Food riot|Food and bread riots]]''' are caused by [[harvest]] failures, incompetent food storage, hoarding, poisoning of food, or attacks by pests like [[locusts]]. When the public becomes desperate from such conditions, groups may attack shops, farms, homes, or government buildings to obtain bread or other staple foods like grain or salt, as in the [[1977 Egyptian Bread Riots]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Effects==
[[File:Riots1844staugestine.jpg|thumb|St. Augustine's Church on fire during the [[Philadelphia Nativist Riots]] in 1844]]
The economic and political effects of riots can be as complex as their origins. Property destruction and harm to individuals are often immediately measurable. During the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], 2,383 people were injured, 8,000 were arrested, 63 were killed and over 700 businesses burned. Property damage was estimated at over $1 billion. At least ten of those killed were shot by police or National Guard forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2002-05-02/news/the-l-a-53/|title=The L.A. 53|author=Jim Crogan|date=Apr 24, 2002|work=LA Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|2005 civil unrest in France#Assessment of rioting}}
Similarly, the [[2005 civil unrest in France]] lasted over three weeks and spread to nearly 300 towns. By the end of the incident, over 10,000 vehicles were destroyed and over 300 buildings burned. Over 2,800 suspected rioters were arrested and 126 police and firefighters were injured. Estimated damages were over €200 Million.

Many governments and political systems have fallen after riots, including:
* [[Russian Empire]]
* [[Ancien Régime]]
* [[British Raj]] in [[India]], when bread and salt riots hastened the withdrawal in 1947
* Governments across the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] during the [[Arab Spring]]

==Riot control and laws==
{{Main|Riot control}}
[[File:Police fighting against anti-Sarkozy with tear gas (487645695).jpg|thumb|upright|Law enforcement teams deployed to control riots often wear body armor and shields, and may use [[tear gas]]]]

Riots are typically dealt with by the police, although methods differ from country to country. Tactics and weapons used can include [[attack dog]]s, [[water cannon]]s, [[plastic bullet]]s, [[rubber bullets]], [[pepper spray]], [[flexible baton round]]s, and [[snatch squad]]s. Many police forces have dedicated divisions to deal with public order situations. Some examples are the [[Territorial Support Group]], [[Special Patrol Group]], [[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité]], [[Mobiele Eenheid]], and [[Arrest unit]]s.

The policing of riots has been marred by incidents in which police have been accused of provoking rioting or crowd violence. While the weapons described above are officially designated as [[non-lethal]], a number of people have died or been injured as a result of their use. For example, seventeen deaths were caused by [[rubber bullets]] in [[Northern Ireland]] over the thirty five years between 1970 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/baton.htm|title=Less-lethal ammunition|quote=an amended version of an article which first appeared in ''Jane's Police Products Review'', October/November 2007, and includes information from British 37mm Baton Rounds, which appeared in ''Small Arms Review'' in August 2008|author=Williams, Anthony G.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903200133/http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/baton.htm|archivedate=2009-09-03|df=}}&lt;!--The "quote" could be better re-written not as a quote and placed here instead of this comment, but uncommented (i.e. outside the cite web template).--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk of arrest===
A high risk of being arrested is even more effective against rioting than severe punishments.&lt;ref name=bb&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-12/how-riots-start-and-how-they-can-be-stopped-edward-glaeser.html How Riots Start, and How They Can Be Stopped: Edward Glaeser], Edward Glaeser, Bloomberg.com, Aug 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=August 2011|reason=This is the opinion of a one economics professor apparently based only the observation of two events - needs more robust sources}} As more and more people join the riot, the risk of being arrested goes down, which persuades still more people to join. This leads to a vicious circle, which is typically ended only by sufficient police or military presence to increase the risk of being arrested.&lt;ref name=bb/&gt;

====India====
In India, rioting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://devgan.in/indian_penal_code/index.php?q=rioting&amp;a=1|title=Offences related to Rioting in Indian Penal Code}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an offense under the [[Indian Penal Code]] (IPC).

====United Kingdom====

=====England and Wales=====
[[File:1981 Brixton Riots.jpg|thumb|The [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton race riot]] in London, 1981]]

'''Riot''' is a [[statutory]] offence in [[England and Wales]]. It is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/1 section 1(1)] of the [[Public Order Act 1986]]. Sections 1(1) to (5) of that Act read:

:(1) Where 12 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose and the conduct of them (taken together) is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety, each of the persons using unlawful violence for the common purpose is guilty of riot.
:(2) It is immaterial whether or not the 12 or more use or threaten unlawful violence simultaneously.
:(3) The common purpose may be inferred from conduct.
:(4) No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene.
:(5) Riot may be committed in private as well as in public places.

A single person can be liable for an offence of riot when they ''use'' violence, provided that it is shown there were at least twelve present ''using or threatening'' unlawful violence.

The word "violence" is defined by section 8. The violence can be against the person or against property. The ''[[mens rea]]'' is defined by section 6(1).

'''Indictment'''

See R v Tyler and others, 96 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 332, [1993] Crim LR 60, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]].

'''Mode of trial and sentence'''

Riot is an [[indictable-only offence]]. A person convicted of riot is liable to [[imprisonment]] for any term not exceeding ten years, or to a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Public Order Act 1986]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/1 section 1(6)]&lt;/ref&gt;

See the following cases:
* R v Luttman [1973] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]] 127, CA
* R v Pilgrim, 5 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 140, CA
* R v Keys, 84 Cr App R 204, 8 Cr App R (S) 444, [1987] Crim LR 207, CA
* R v Cooke, 9 Cr App R (S) 116, CA

'''Association football matches'''

In the case of riot connected to football hooliganism, the offender may be banned from football grounds for a set or indeterminate period of time and may be required to surrender their passport to the police for a period of time in the event of a club or international match, or international tournament, connected with the offence. This prevents travelling to the match or tournament in question. (The measures were brought in by the [[Football (Disorder) Act 2000]] after rioting of England fans at [[Euro 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/25/notes/contents |title=Explanatory Notes to the Football (Disorder) Act 2000 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Compensation for riot damage'''

See the [[Riot (Damages) Act 1886]] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/21/section/235 section 235] of the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1995]]..

'''Construction of "riot" and cognate expressions in other instruments'''

Section 10 of the Public Order Act 1986 now provides:

:(1) In the [[Riot (Damages) Act 1886]] . . . (compensation for riot damage) "riotous" and "riotously" shall be construed in accordance with section 1 above.
:(2) In Schedule 1 to the [[Marine Insurance Act 1906]] (form and rules for the construction of certain insurance policies) "rioters" in rule 8 and "riot" in rule 10 shall, in the application of the rules to any policy taking effect on or after the [[coming into force]] of this section, be construed in accordance with section 1 above unless a different intention appears.
:(3) "Riot" and cognate expressions in any [[enactment (British legal term)|enactment]] in force before the coming into force of this section (other than the enactments mentioned in subsections (1) and (2) above) shall be construed in accordance with section 1 above if they would have been construed in accordance with the common law offence of riot apart from this Part.
:(4) Subject to subsections (1) to (3) above and unless a different intention appears, nothing in this Part affects the meaning of "riot" or any cognate expression in any enactment in force, or other instrument taking effect, before the coming into force of this section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/10 Digitized copy]&lt;/ref&gt;

As to this provision, see pages 84 and 85 of the Law Commission's report.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1983/123.pdf Criminal Law: Offences relating to Public Order] (Law Com 123). HMSO. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Common law offence'''

The [[common law offence]] of riot was abolished&lt;ref&gt;The [[Public Order Act 1986]], section 9(1)&lt;/ref&gt; for England and Wales&lt;ref&gt;The [[Public Order Act 1986]], section 42&lt;/ref&gt; on 1 April 1987.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Public Order Act 1986 (Commencement No. 2) Order 1987]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1987/198/article/2/made article 2] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1987/198/schedule/made Schedule] (1987/198 (C. 4))&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''

In the past, the [[Riot Act]] had to be read by an official - with the wording exactly correct - before violent policing action could take place. If the group did not disperse after the Act was read, lethal force could legally be used against the crowd. See also the [[Black Act]].

Section 515 of the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1894]] formerly made provision for compensation for riot damage.

=====Northern Ireland=====
Riot is a serious offence for the purposes of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008.&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/2008/1216/article/12 article 12(2)] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/2008/1216/schedule/1 Schedule 1], paragraph 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

See [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apni/1962/14/schedule/5/paragraph/13 paragraph 13] of Schedule 5 to the [[Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1962]].

=====Scotland=====
There is an offence under the law of Scotland which is known both as "[[Mobbing (Scots law)|mobbing]]" and "mobbing and rioting".

In July 1981, both Dundee and Edinburgh saw significant disorder as part of the events of that July,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/14/opinion/the-riot-experts.html| title=The Riot Experts |publisher=The New York Times, July 14, 1981| accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/2461950/| title=Police report flare-ups Police at Dundee, The Kokomo Tribune|publisher=newspapers.com The Kokomo Tribune from Kokomo, Indiana · Page 1 July 13, 1981| accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmisi.org/ma/26_02/kirk.pdf| title=The Architecture of Servitude and Boredom, Russell Kirk |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-s0XRjs-LU| title="eh16" - The Craigmillar Riots of 1994| accessdate=2015-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-braced-further-attacks-edinburgh-2041698| title=Police braced for further rioting in Edinburgh after patrol cars are petrol bombed, Daily Record, 10 July 2013 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; two years after the English riots of August 2011, Edinburgh saw rioting, albeit localised to one specific area and not part of any bigger 'riot wave'. Events in 1981 were very similar to those in England, although sources are severely limited. Both [[Niddrie, Edinburgh|Niddrie]] and [[Craigmillar]] saw riots in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unregardededinburgh.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/niddrie-old-police-station/| title=Unregarded Edinburgh, Niddrie Old Police Station| accessdate=2015-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{See also|Civil Rights Act of 1968}}
[[File:Leffler - 1968 Washington, D.C. Martin Luther King, Jr. riots.jpg|thumb|The aftermath of a [[1968 Washington, D.C. riots|Washington, D.C. riot]] in April 1968.]]
Under [[Law of the United States|United States federal law]], a riot is defined as:
&lt;blockquote&gt; A public disturbance involving (1) an act or acts of violence by one or more persons part of an assemblage of three or more persons, which act or acts shall constitute a clear and present danger of, or shall result in, damage or injury to the property of any other person or to the person of any other individual or (2) a threat or threats of the commission of an act or acts of violence by one or more persons part of an assemblage of three or more persons having, individually or collectively, the ability of immediate execution of such threat or threats, where the performance of the threatened act or acts of violence would constitute a clear and present danger of, or would result in, damage or injury to the property of any other person or to the person of any other individual.{{usc|18|2102}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Each state may have its own definition of a riot. In [[New York (state)|New York]], the term ''riot'' is not defined explicitly, but under § 240.08 of the [[N.Y. Penal Law]],"A person is guilty of inciting to riot when one urges ten or more persons to engage in tumultuous and violent conduct of a kind likely to create public alarm."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4593">{{Canadian Charter}}
'''Section 21''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' is one of several sections of the ''Charter'' relating to the [[official language]]s of [[Canada]]. The official languages, under [[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 16]] of the ''Charter'', are [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. Sections 16 to [[Section Twenty of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|20]] guarantee a number of rights in regard to the use of these languages in the federal and [[New Brunswick]] courts and other government institutions. Thus, section 21 clarifies that language rights regarding English and French in the [[Constitution of Canada]], outside the ''Charter'', remain valid and are not limited by the language rights within the ''Charter''.

==Text==
In full, it reads,

{{cquote|21. Nothing in sections 16 to 20 abrogates or derogates from any right, privilege or obligation with respect to the English and French languages, or either of them, that exists or is continued by virtue of any other provision of the Constitution of Canada.}}

==Function==
Section 21 thus reaffirms language rights in the Constitution in respect to the provinces of [[Quebec]] and [[Manitoba]]. Although neither of these provinces are officially bilingual, there are constitutional rights regarding the use of English and French in those provinces that are not duplicated in the Charter. Specifically, section 133 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' guarantees that anyone in the Quebec legislature (now known as the [[National Assembly of Quebec]]) may speak in either language, and that the records of the National Assembly must be kept in both languages. Furthermore, bilingualism is allowed in Quebec courts. 

The same rights are guaranteed in respect to the federal government under section 133, but these are repeated in [[Section Seventeen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 17]], [[Section Eighteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 18]] and [[Section Nineteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 19]] of the ''Charter''.

The ''[[Manitoba Act]]'', which created the province of Manitoba in 1870 and is considered part of the Constitution of Canada, contains similar language rights. Section 23 of that Act states that everyone may speak in English or French in the legislature and in Manitoba courts, and that the records of the legislature must be kept in both languages. These rights, too, are not duplicated by the Charter but are reaffirmed by section 21 of the ''Charter''.

==Comparisons to other ''Charter'' sections==
Whereas section 16 can be used to guarantee rights to those working in government offices to use either French or English, it has been noted that the rights referred to in section 21 do not.&lt;ref&gt;Tremblay, Andre. "The Language Rights." In ''The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: Commentary,'' eds. [[Walter S. Tarnopolsky]] and Gerard-A. Beaudoin (Toronto: The Carswell Company Limited, 1982), 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 21 can be better compared to some of the sections under the heading "General" (sections 25-31). This is because it is "negative in form," not guaranteeing rights but protecting pre-existing ones. Like section 21, [[Section Twenty-nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 29]] protects rights (in this case [[denominational school]] rights) that appear elsewhere in the Constitution. [[Section Twenty-five of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 25]] refers to [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] rights and [[Section Twenty-six of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 26]] refers to other rights not in the ''Charter'', although unlike section 21 these sections recognize rights outside the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Lysyk, Kenneth M. "The Rights and Freedoms of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada." In ''The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: Commentary,'' eds. [[Walter S. Tarnopolsky]] and Gerard-A. Beaudoin (Toronto: The Carswell Company Limited, 1982), 471.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1513">'''Skaneateles Community''' was a [[utopian]] [[social experiment]] established in 1843 by the Society for Universal Inquiry and Reform in a {{convert|350|acre|km2|sing=on}} farm near [[Mottville, New York|Mottville]], in [[Skaneateles (town), New York|Skaneateles]] in [[Upstate New York]]. It was one of several communities established by the Society prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. It survived for three years. John A. Collins (1810–1900), a noted [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionst]], became the [[community leader]]. During its life, the community had about a hundred members who shared living quarters as well as work on the [[farm]], and in the [[sawmill]] and [[printer (publisher)|print shop]]. Although economically viable, internal differences and Collins' waning leadership resulted in the dissolution of the community.

Although it was not originally used pejoratively by Šuvaković, because of its reverberation of the very name of [[Socialist Realism|Socialistic Realism]], a style of socialist propaganda in painting and sculpture, it has staid an irony of a renewed political funding of art, that censors by financing not forbidding.

As a party representing a national minority, the SSW declines to identify itself with a [[Left–right politics|left-right political scale]], but it models its policies on those of the [[Nordic model|Nordic]] countries, which often means favouring a strong [[welfare state]], but, on the other hand, a more [[free market]] labour policy than the German [[social market economy]] model.&lt;ref name="Magone2011"/&gt; The SSW is represented in the [[Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein]] and several regional and municipal councils. The party has not contested any [[Elections in Germany|federal elections in Germany]] since 1965.

As a party for the national Danish minority in [[Southern Schleswig]], the SSW is not subject to the general requirement of passing a 5% vote threshold to gain proportional seats in either the state parliament (Landtag) or the federal German parliament (Bundestag).&lt;ref name="Marten2015"/&gt; In the most recent [[Schleswig-Holstein state election, 2017|2017 state election]], the SSW received 3.3% of the votes and four seats.

==History==
In the [[Schleswig-Holstein state election, 2005|2005 state election]] the SSW received 3.6% (two seats). This was enough for the SSW to hold the balance of power between the national parties of the left and right, and the SSW chose to support a coalition of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and [[Alliance '90/The Greens|The Greens]], without joining the coalition itself.&lt;ref name="Magone2011"/&gt; This resulted in criticism from the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) and from German national conservative circles, who asserted that since the SSW had been granted a special status, it was obliged to defend only minority interests, and that its status should be revoked if the SSW behaved like a "regular" party. The SSW representatives, however, insisted on the full value of their parliamentary seats and their equal rights as German citizens. One particular point was that the SSW had taken a strong position on educational principles in the state (abolishing the traditional German system of dividing pupils according to academic ability already after the 4th grade into different types of secondary schools). The CDU argued that since there were separate Danish-language schools, it was unreasonable for the SSW to involve itself in the affairs of the public schools.

As the planned SPD-Greens coalition did not make it into office after the [[Schleswig-Holstein state election, 2009|2009 state election]], a centre-right coalition was formed between the CDU and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP), and the SSW joined the opposition.

In the [[Schleswig-Holstein state election, 2012|2012 state election]], the SSW gained 4.6% of all votes and three seats in the state Landtag.&lt;ref name="StatAmt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landtagswahl-sh.de/wahlen.php?site=left/gebiete&amp;wahl=23#index.php?site=right/ergebnis&amp;wahl=23&amp;anzeige=4&amp;gebiet=1&amp;idx=0&amp;typ=1&amp;stimme=2&amp;hoch=0&amp;partei=&amp;untertyp=0&amp;flip=1&amp;sitz=0&amp;sitzHoch=0&amp;mode=liste |title=Landtagswahl in Schleswig-Holstein am 6. Mai 2012 |language=German |publisher=Statistical Office for Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg |date=7 May 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A coalition of the SPD, Greens and SSW was concluded in June 2012, and the former parliamentary leader, [[Anke Spoorendonk]], was appointed Minister for Culture, Justice and European Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article106500808/Daenen-Ampel-steht-Albig-regiert-in-Kiel.html |title=Dänen-Ampel steht – Albig regiert in Kiel |language=German |date=12 June 2012 |accessdate=18 June 2012 |work=[[Die Welt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time in German history that a minority party had participated in a state government. The new coalition government has plenty of nicknames, for instance "Dänen-Ampel" ("Dane-[[Traffic light coalition|traffic light]]"), "Schleswig-Holstein-Ampel", "rot-grün-blaue Koaltion" or "rød-grøn-blå koalitionsregering" (red–green–blue alliance), "Küstenampel" (Coastal traffic light) and "Nord-Ampel" (North traffic light).

==SSWUngdom==
The [[SSW-Youth|Youth in the SSW]] ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''SSWUngdom'', [[German language|German]]: ''Jugend im SSW'') is the youth wing of the South Schleswig Voter Federation.  The current Chairman of the committee is Christopher Andresen.

'''Security and strategic studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] centered on the study of [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] and [[peace]] [[Strategy|strategies]], often devoting special attention to the relationship between [[international politics]], [[geostrategy]], [[international diplomacy]], [[international economics]], and [[armed forces|military power]]. In the scope of the studies are also subjects such as the role of [[intelligence]], [[diplomacy]], and international cooperation for security and defense. The subject is normally taught at the [[post-graduate]] academic or professional, usually strategic-political and strategic-military levels.

The academic foundations of the subject began with classic texts initially from the Orient such as [[Sun Tzu]]’s ''[[Art of War]]'' and went on to gain a European focus with [[Carl von Clausewitz]]’s ''[[On War]]''. Like Clausewitz, many academics in this field reject monocausal theories and hypotheses that reduce the study of conflict to one independent variable and one dependent variable.  Already in the late eighteenth century, a colourful mathematician named [[Dietrich Heinrich von Bülow]] attempted to establish mathematical formulae for the conduct of war.  Carl von Clausewitz rejected Bülow’s approach and his popular claim that warfare could be reduced to positivist, teachable principles of war.  Instead of formulae, we find Clausewitz stressing, time and again, that the whole purpose of educating the military commander is not to give him a series of answers for the task he will face (the complexities of which cannot be foreseen), but to educate him about different aspects of what will face him so as to let him evaluate the situation for himself, and develop his own strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Otte: “Educating Bellona: Carl von Clausewitz and Military Education”, in G.C. Kennedy &amp; K. Neilson (eds): ''Military Education: Past, Present and Future'' (New York: Praeger, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Strategic thinkers on the whole will search for recurrent patterns, which in themselves cannot predict the characteristics of any individual case even if it doubtless fits a larger category; not all patterns of characteristics will be found in all cases.

In recent times, the major conflicts of the nineteenth century and the two [[World Wars]] have spurred strategic thinkers such as [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahan]], [[Julian Corbett|Corbett]], [[Giulio Douhet]], [[Liddell Hart]] and, later, [[Andre Beaufre|André Beaufre]]. The Cold War with its danger of degenerating into a nuclear war produced an expansion of the discipline, with authors like [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]], [[Michael Howard (historian)|Michael Howard]], [[Raymond Aron]], [[Lucien Poirier]], [[Lawrence Freedman]], [[Colin S. Gray|Colin Gray]], and many others.

The '''Supreme Soviet''' ({{lang-ru|Верховный Совет}}, ''Verkhovny Sovet'', {{lang-en|literally "Supreme Council"}}) was the common name for the [[legislative bodies]] (parliaments) of the [[Soviet socialist republic]]s (SSR) in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR). These soviets were modeled after the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]], established in 1938, and were nearly identical.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XAItI5C_JPUC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;f=false Where nation-states come from: institutional change in the age of nationalism by Philip G.

The Supreme Soviets also elected the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union | Council of Ministers]], an executive body. After the [[dissolution of the USSR]] in late December 1991, most of these soviets became the legislatures of independent countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2550">A '''take-off warning system''' or '''TOWS''' is a set of warning signals required on most commercial aircraft, designed to alert the pilots of potentially-dangerous errors in an aircraft's take-off configuration.

There are numerous systems on board an aircraft that must be set in the proper configuration to allow it to take off safely. Prior to every flight, the flight officers use checklists to verify that each of the many systems is operating and has been configured correctly. However, due to the inevitability of [[human error]], even the checklist procedure can lead to failures to properly configure the aircraft.

Several improper configurations can leave an aircraft completely unable to become airborne—these conditions can easily result in fatal [[hull loss]] accidents. In order to reduce this, all major nations now mandate something similar to the US requirement that on (nearly) "all airplanes with a maximum weight more than 6,000 pounds and all jets [...] a takeoff warning system must be installed". This system must meet the following requirements:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) The system must provide to the pilots an aural warning that is automatically activated during the initial portion of the takeoff roll if the airplane is in a configuration that would not allow a safe takeoff. The warning must continue until—

:(1) The configuration is changed to allow safe takeoff, or

:(2) Action is taken by the pilot to abandon the takeoff roll.

(b) The means used to activate the system must function properly for all authorized takeoff power settings and procedures and throughout the ranges of takeoff weights, altitudes, and temperatures for which certification is requested.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/23.703&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

TOWS is designed to sound a warning for numerous other dangerous errors in the take-off configuration, such as the flaps and slats not being extended when the throttles are opened while the aircraft is on the ground. The alert is typically in the form of an audible warning horn accompanied by a voice message that indicates the nature of the configuration error.

A number of aircraft disasters due to improper configuration have happened in spite of the presence of a functional take-off warning system:

* [[Delta Air Lines Flight 1141]]
* [[LAPA Flight 3142]]
* [[Lufthansa Flight 540]]
* [[Mandala Airlines Flight 91]]
* [[Northwest Airlines Flight 255]]
* [[Spanair Flight 5022]]

==Etymology==
The word ''Taliban'' is [[Pashto]], {{lang|ps|طالبان}} ''{{transl|ps|ṭālibān}}'', meaning "students", the plural of ''[[Talibe|ṭālib]]''. This is a [[loanword]] from [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|طالب}} ''{{transl|ar|ṭālib}}'',  using the [[Persian language|Persian]] plural ending ''-ān'' {{lang|ps|ان}}. In Arabic {{lang|ar|طالبان}} ''{{transl|ar|ṭālibān}}'' means not "students" but "two students", as it is a [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form, the Arabic plural being {{lang|ar|طلاب}} ''{{transl|ar|ṭullāb}}''—occasionally causing some confusion to Arabic speakers. Since becoming a loanword in English, ''Taliban'', besides a plural noun referring to the group, has also been used as a singular noun referring to an individual. For example, [[John Walker Lindh]] has been referred to as "an American Taliban", rather than "an American Talib". In the English language newspapers of Pakistan, the word ''Talibans'' is often used when referring to more than one Taliban. The spelling ''Taliban'' has come to be predominant over ''Taleban'' in English.&lt;ref name="Arabic Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.ectaco.co.uk/main.jsp?do=e-services-dictionaries-word_translate1&amp;status=translate&amp;lang1=23&amp;lang2=ar&amp;source_id=2248807 |title=English &lt;-&gt; Arabic Online Dictionary |publisher=Online.ectaco.co.uk |date=2006-12-28 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Curtis |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2009/06/from_taleban_to_taliban.html |title=From 'Taleban' to 'Taliban' |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Soviet intervention (1978–1992)===
[[File:Reagan sitting with people from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region in February 1983.jpg|thumb|President [[Ronald Reagan]] meeting with [[Afghan Mujahideen]] leaders in the Oval Office in 1983]]
After [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)#Soviet intervention and withdrawal|the Soviet Union intervened and occupied Afghanistan in 1979]], Islamic [[mujahideen]] fighters engaged in war with those Soviet forces.

[[Pakistan]]'s President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] feared that the Soviets were planning to invade also [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], Pakistan, so he sent [[Akhtar Abdur Rahman]] to [[Saudi Arabia]] to garner support for the Afghan resistance against Soviet occupation forces. A while later, the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and Saudi Arabic General Intelligence Directorate (GID) funneled funding and equipment through the [[Pakistan]]I [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Inter-Service Intelligence Agency]] (ISI) to the Afghan mujahideen.&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pakistan: A Plethora of Problems |url=http://globalsecuritystudies.com/Price%20Pakistan.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-12-22 |work=Global Security Studies, Winter 2012, Volume 3, Issue 1, by Colin Price, School of Graduate and Continuing Studies in Diplomacy |location=Norwich University, Northfield, VT.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 90,000 Afghans, including [[Mohammed Omar]], were trained by Pakistan's ISI during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;
The British Professor [[Carole Hillenbrand]] concluded that the Taliban have arisen from those US-Saudi-Pakistan-supported mujahideen: "The West helped the Taliban to fight the Soviet takeover of Afghanistan".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hillenbrand|2015|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Soviet-backed regime of [[Mohammad Najibullah]] in 1992, many Afghan political parties, but not [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s [[Hezb-e Islami]], [[Hizb-e Wahdat]], and [[Ittihad-i Islami]], in April agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement, the [[Peshawar Accord]], which created the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] and appointed an interim government for a transitional period; but that Islamic State and its government were paralyzed right from the start, due to rivalling groups contending for total power over Kabul and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=photius,peshawar&gt;[https://photius.com/countries/afghanistan/government/afghanistan_government_the_peshawar_accord~72.html 'The Peshawar Accord, April 25, 1992'].

Hekmatyar's [[Hezb-e Islami]] party refused to recognize the interim government, and [[Afghan Civil War (1992–1996)#Timeline|in April infiltrated Kabul to take power for itself, thus starting this civil war]]. In May, Hekmatyar started attacks against government forces and [[Kabul]].&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch (4)"/&gt; Hekmatyar received operational, financial and military support from Pakistan's ISI.&lt;ref name="Neamatollah Nojumi"&gt;{{cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |pages=| publisher = Palgrave, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; With that help,  Hekmatyar's forces were able to destroy half of Kabul.&lt;ref name="Amin Saikal"/&gt; [[Iran]] assisted the [[Hizb-e Wahdat]] forces of [[Abdul Ali Mazari]].

[[File:Aerial view of a section of Kandahar in 2013.jpg|thumb|The Taliban emerged in the southern Afghan city of [[Kandahar]] around September 1994.]]
Due to this sudden initiation of civil war, working government departments, police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly created [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] did not have time to form. Horrific crimes were committed by individuals inside different factions. Ceasefires, negotiated by representatives of the Islamic State's newly appointed Defense Minister [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], President [[Sibghatullah Mojaddedi]] and later President [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] (the interim government), or officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), commonly collapsed within days.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch (4)"/&gt; The countryside in northern Afghanistan, parts of which was under the control of Defense Minister Massoud remained calm and some reconstruction took place. The city of Herat under the rule of Islamic State ally [[Ismail Khan]] also witnessed relative calm.

Meanwhile, southern Afghanistan was neither under the control of foreign-backed militias nor the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as [[Gul Agha Sherzai]] and their militias. The Taliban only first [[Afghan Civil War (1992–1996)#July–December|emerged on the scene in August 1994]], announcing to liberate Afghanistan from its present corrupt leadership of warlords, and establish a pure Islamic society.

{{Further|Afghan Civil War (1992–1996)#1994}}
The Taliban are a movement of religious students (''talib'') from the [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] areas of eastern and southern Afghanistan who were educated in [[Madrassas in Pakistan|traditional Islamic schools in Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=massacreMazar,II&gt;{{cite web |year= |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-01.htm#P81_13959 |title=Afghanistan: The massacre in Mazar-i Sharif.

====Education====

[[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Mohammad Omar]] in September 1994 in his hometown of [[Kandahar]] with 50 students founded the group.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25"&gt;Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994–1997'', [[Oxford University Press]], (1999), pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Omar had since 1992 been studying in the [[Singesar|Sang-i-Hisar]] [[madrasa|madrassa]] in [[Maiwand]] (northern [[Kandahar Province]]), was disappointed that [[Islam]]ic law had not been installed in Afghanistan after the ousting of communist rule, and now with his group pledged to rid Afghanistan of warlords and criminals.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/367 'The Taliban']. ''Mapping Militant Organizations.'' Stanford University. Updated 15 July 2016. Retrieved 24 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within months, 15,000 students, often Afghan refugees, from religious schools or [[madrasa]]s – one source calls them [[Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (F)#Madrassas|Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-run madrasas]]&lt;ref name="Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25"/&gt; – in [[Pakistan]] joined the group.

The U.S. government covertly provided violent schoolbooks filled with militant Islamic teachings and jihad and images of weapons and soldiers in an effort to inculcate in children anti-Soviet insurgency and hate for foreigners. The Taliban used the American textbooks but scratched out human faces in keeping with strict fundamentalist interpretation. The [[United States Agency for International Development]] gave millions of dollars to the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]] in the 1980s to develop and publish the textbooks in local languages.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, 23 Mar. 2002, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/03/23/from-us-the-abcs-of-jihad/d079075a-3ed3-4030-9a96-0d48f6355e54/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9c1d636700bd From U.S., the ABC's of Jihad]"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Motivation====
Those early Taliban were motivated by the suffering among the Afghan people, which they believed resulted from power struggles between Afghan groups not adhering to the moral code of Islam; in their religious schools they had been taught a belief in strict Islamic law.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Turbulent&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ogata|first1=Sadako N.|title=The Turbulent Decade: Confronting the Refugee Crises of the 1990s|date=2005|publisher=W.

====Pakistani involvement====

But sources state that [[Pakistan]] was heavily involved, already in October 1994, in the "creating" of the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Brenda|title=The Limits of Culture: Islam and Foreign Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEOd-cDWVwQC&amp;pg=PA267|year=2006|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-19529-4|page=267|quote=Pakistani involvement in creating the movement is seen as central}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See further references in [[Taliban#Role of the Pakistani military|§ Role of the Pakistani military]], [[Taliban#Pakistan|§ Relations with Pakistan]], and article [[Afghan Civil War (1992–1996)#1994]]&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] agency (ISI), strongly supporting the Taliban in 1994, hoped for a new ruling power in Afghanistan favorable to Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

On 3 November 1994, the Taliban in a surprise attack conquered [[Kandahar|Kandahar City]].&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt; Before 4 January 1995, they controlled 12 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|Afghan provinces]].&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;
Militias controlling the different areas often surrendered without a fight. Omar's commanders were a mixture of former small-unit military commanders and madrassa teachers.&lt;ref name=Felbab-Brow&gt;{{cite book|last=Felbab-Brow |first=Vanda|title=Shooting up: counterinsurgency and the war on drugs|year=2010|publisher=Brookings Institution Press |isbn=978-0-8157-0328-0|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rashid 2000 27–29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=27–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch (5)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=29"&gt;{{Harvnb |Rashid|2000|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Goodson|2001 | p = 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At these stages, the Taliban were popular, because they stamped out corruption, curbed lawlessness, and made the roads and area safe.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

===1995 – September 1996===
{{Further|Afghan Civil War (1992–1996)#1995}}
In a bid to establish their rule over all Afghanistan, the Taliban started shelling [[Kabul]] in early 1995.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;Amnesty International. "Document – Afghanistan: further information on fear for safety and new concern: deliberate and arbitrary killings: civilians in Kabul". 16 November 1995 Accessed at [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa11/015/1995/en/ Amnesty.org]  &lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban first suffered a devastating defeat against government forces of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] under the command of Ahmad Shah Massoud.

Pakistan, however, started to provide stronger military support to the Taliban.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} On September 26, 1996, as the Taliban prepared for another major offensive, Massoud ordered a full retreat from Kabul to continue anti-Taliban resistance in the northeastern [[Hindu Kush]] mountains instead of engaging in street battles in Kabul. The Taliban entered Kabul on September 27, 1996, and established the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]. Analysts described the Taliban then as developing into a [[Proxy war|proxy]] force for Pakistan's regional interests.&lt;ref name="Amin Saikal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch (5)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-01.htm#P81_13959 |title=II.

===Taliban's Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996–2001)===
{{Main|Afghan Civil War (1996–2001)|Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan}}
The military goal of the Taliban during the period 1995 to 2001 was to return the order of [[Abdur Rahman Khan|Abdur Rahman]] (''the Iron [[Emir]]'') by the re-establishment of a state with [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] dominance within the northern areas.&lt;ref name="B.G.

By 1998, the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban's Emirate]] controlled 90% of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

In December 2000, the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1333|UNSC in Resolution 1333]], recognizing humanitarian needs of the Afghan people, condemning the use of Taliban territory for training of "terrorists" and Taliban providing safehaven to [[Osama bin Laden]], issued severe sanctions against Afghanistan under Taliban control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N00/806/62/DOC/N0080662.DOC UNSC Resolution 1333, 19 December 2000] (sanctions against Taliban territory). Retrieved 26 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2001, the [[United States]], with allies including the Afghan [[Northern Alliance]], invaded Afghanistan and routed the Taliban regime. The Taliban leadership fled into Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

====Afghanistan during Taliban rule====
{{Main|Talibanization}}
When the Taliban took power in 1996, [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|twenty years of continuous warfare]] had devastated Afghanistan's [[infrastructure]] and economy. There was no running water, little electricity, few telephones, functioning roads or regular energy supplies. Basic necessities like water, food, housing and others were in desperately short supply. In addition, the [[clan]] and family structure that provided Afghans with a social/economic safety net was also badly damaged.  Afghanistan's infant mortality was the highest in the world. A full quarter of all children died before they reached their fifth birthday, a rate several times higher than most other developing countries.&lt;ref name="rashid 107"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
UNCP Country Development Indicators, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

International charitable and/or development organisations ([[non-governmental organization]]s or NGOs) were extremely important to the supply of food, employment, reconstruction, and other services, but the Taliban proved highly suspicious towards the 'help' those organizations offered (see [[Taliban#United Nations and NGOs|§ United Nations and NGOs]]). With one million plus deaths during the years of war, the number of families headed by widows had reached 98,000 by 1998. In Kabul, where vast portions of the city had been devastated from rocket attacks, more than half of its 1.2 million people benefited in some way from NGO activities, even for water to drink.  The [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)|civil war]] and its never-ending refugee stream continued throughout the Taliban's reign. The Mazar, Herat, and Shomali valley offensives displaced more than three-quarters of a million civilians, using "[[scorched earth]]" tactics to prevent them from supplying the enemy with aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00141.x?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=hico |title=Quoting the ICRC |journal=History Compass |volume=3 |publisher=Blackwell-synergy.com |date=2005|doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00141.x |last1=Nichols |first1=Robert }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=64, 78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taliban decision-makers, particularly Mullah Omar, seldom if ever talked directly to non-Muslim foreigners, so aid providers had to deal with intermediaries whose approvals and agreements were often reversed.&lt;ref name="rashid 101-102"/&gt; Around September 1997 the heads of three UN agencies in Kandahar were expelled from the country after protesting when a female [[lawyer|attorney]] for the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] was forced to talk from behind a curtain so her face would not be visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the UN increased the number of Muslim women staff to satisfy Taliban demands, the Taliban then required all female Muslim UN staff traveling to Afghanistan to be chaperoned by a [[mahram]] or a blood relative.&lt;ref name=taliban71&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1998, the Taliban closed "all NGO offices" by force after those organizations refused to move to a bombed-out former [[Institute of technology|Polytechnic]] College as ordered.&lt;ref name=bmj&gt;
[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7155/369/a Aid agencies pull out of Kabul] The building had neither electricity or running water.&lt;/ref&gt; One month later the UN offices were also shut down.&lt;ref name=rashid,71&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=71–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As food prices rose and conditions deteriorated, Planning Minister Qari Din Mohammed explained the Taliban's indifference to the loss of humanitarian aid:

{{quote|We Muslims believe God the Almighty will feed everybody one way or another. If the foreign NGOs leave then it is their decision. We have not expelled them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]], "Taliban reject warnings of aid pull-out", 1998-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Role of the Pakistani military====
The Taliban were largely founded by Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] beginning in 1994; the I.S.I. used the Taliban to establish a regime in Afghanistan which would be favorable to Pakistan, as they were trying to gain [[strategic depth]]. Since the creation of the Taliban, the ISI and the Pakistani military have given financial, logistical and military support.&lt;ref name="Giraldo"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaffer2&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Brenda|title=The Limits of Culture: Islam and Foreign Policy|year=2006|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-69321-9|page=267|quote=Pakistani involvement in creating the movement is seen as central}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forsythe3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David P.|title=Encyclopedia of human rights|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533402-9|page=2|edition=Volume 1|quote=In 1994 the Taliban was created, funded and inspired by Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="[[Hall Gardner]]"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Hall|title=American global strategy and the 'war on terrorism'|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-7094-0|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Owen Bennett|title=Pakistan: eye of the storm|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10147-8|page =240|quote=The ISI's undemocratic tendencies are not restricted to its interference in the electoral process.

According to Pakistani Afghanistan expert [[Ahmed Rashid]], "between 1994 and 1999, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Pakistanis trained and fought in Afghanistan" on the side of the Taliban. [[Peter Tomsen]] stated that up until 9/11 Pakistani military and ISI officers along with thousands of regular Pakistani armed forces personnel had been involved in the fighting in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=Maley&gt;{{cite book|last=Maley|first=William|title=The Afghanistan wars|year=2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-21313-5|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tomsen-322&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomsen|first=Peter|title=Wars of Afghanistan|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-763-8|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2001, according to several international sources, 28,000–30,000 Pakistani nationals, 14,000–15,000 Afghan Taliban and 2,000–3,000 [[Al-Qaeda]] militants were fighting against anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan as a roughly 45,000 strong military force.  Pakistani President [[Pervez Musharraf]] – then as Chief of Army Staff – was responsible for sending thousands of Pakistanis to fight alongside the Taliban and Bin Laden against the forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud. Of the estimated 28,000 Pakistani nationals fighting in Afghanistan, 8,000 were militants recruited in [[madrassa]]s filling regular Taliban ranks. The document further states that the parents of those Pakistani nationals "know nothing regarding their child's military involvement with the Taliban until their bodies are brought back to Pakistan". A 1998 document by the [[U.S. State Department]] confirms that "20–40 percent of [regular] Taliban soldiers are Pakistani."  According to the U.S. State Department report and reports by Human Rights Watch, the other Pakistani nationals fighting in Afghanistan were regular Pakistani soldiers, especially from the [[Frontier Corps]] but also from the army providing direct combat support.&lt;ref name="Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="George Washington University"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch-PST-no-quote"&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghan2/Afghan0701-02.htm | title = Pakistan's support of the Taliban | publisher = Human Rights Watch | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edward Girardet"&gt;{{cite book | last = Edward Girardet| title =Killing the Cranes: A Reporter's Journey Through Three Decades of War in Afghanistan |edition=August 3, 2011 |page=416 | publisher = Chelsea Green Publishing| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rashid 2000 91"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "National Geographic"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007 |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpQI6HKV-ZY&amp;feature=related |title = Inside the Taliban| publisher = [[National Geographic Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch wrote in 2000:

{{quote|Of all the foreign powers involved in efforts to sustain and manipulate the ongoing fighting [in Afghanistan], Pakistan is distinguished both by the sweep of its objectives and the scale of its efforts, which include soliciting funding for the Taliban, bankrolling Taliban operations, providing diplomatic support as the Taliban's virtual emissaries abroad, arranging training for Taliban fighters, recruiting skilled and unskilled manpower to serve in Taliban armies, planning and directing offensives, providing and facilitating shipments of ammunition and fuel, and ... directly providing combat support.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch-PST"/&gt;}}

On 1 August 1997, the Taliban launched an attack on Sheberghan, the main military base of Abdul Rashid Dostum. Dostum has said the reason the attack was successful was due to 1500 Pakistani commandos taking part and that the Pakistani air force also gave support.&lt;ref name=Clements2&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Frank|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a historical encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-402-8|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Iran accused Pakistan of sending its air force to bomb [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] in support of Taliban forces and directly accused Pakistani troops for "war crimes at [[Bamiyan]]". The same year, Russia said Pakistan was responsible for the "military expansion" of the Taliban in northern Afghanistan by sending large numbers of Pakistani troops, some of whom had subsequently been taken as prisoners by the anti-Taliban United Front.&lt;ref name="Washington Post (2)"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/34079877.html?dids=34079877:34079877&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+16%2C+1998&amp;author=Pamela+Constable&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Afghanistan%3A+Arena+for+a+New+Rivalry&amp;pqatl=google| title = Afghanistan: Arena for a New Rivalry | last =Constable| first = Pamela| work = The Washington Post| date=1998-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Press Trust of India"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19980812/22450054.html | title = Pak involved in Taliban offensive – Russia | publisher = Express India | year = 1998 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050128030041/http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19980812/22450054.html | archivedate = 2005-01-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2000, the UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo against military support to the Taliban, with UN officials explicitly singling out Pakistan. The UN secretary-general implicitly criticized Pakistan for its military support and the Security Council stated it was "deeply distress[ed] over reports of involvement in the fighting, on the Taliban side, of thousands of non-Afghan nationals". In July 2001, several countries, including the United States, accused Pakistan of being "in violation of U.N. sanctions because of its military aid to the Taliban". The Taliban also obtained financial resources from Pakistan. In 1997 alone, after the [[Battle of Kabul (1992–1996)|capture of Kabul]] by the Taliban, Pakistan gave $30 million in aid and a further $10 million for government wages.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.un.org/News/dh/latest/afghan/un-afghan-history.shtml | title = Afghanistan &amp; the United Nations | publisher = [[United Nations]] | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Times (2)"&gt;{{cite news | url =http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&amp;p_theme=wt&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED02FA7F968789D&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM| title = U.S. presses for bin Laden's ejection | work = [[The Washington Times]] | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Byman&gt;{{cite book|last=Byman|first=Daniel|title=Deadly connections: states that sponsor terrorism|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83973-0|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2000, [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Intelligence]] reported that the ISI was taking an active role in several [[Al-Qaeda]] training camps. The ISI helped with the construction of training camps for both the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. From 1996 to 2001 the [[Al-Qaeda]] of [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] became a state within the Taliban state.

The role of the Pakistani military has been described by international observers as well as by the anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud as a "creeping invasion".&lt;ref name="Maley"/&gt;

====Anti-Taliban resistance under Massoud====

[[File:Afghanistan politisch 2000.png|thumb|The [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] and the [[Northern Alliance]] in the spring of 2000, when the Taliban was at the height of its power.]]

[[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], former enemies, created the United Front ([[Northern Alliance]]) against the Taliban that were preparing offensives against the remaining areas under the control of Massoud and those under the control of Dostum. The United Front included beside the dominantly [[Tajiks|Tajik]] forces of Massoud and the [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] forces of Dostum, [[Hazaras|Hazara]] troops led by [[Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq]] and [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] forces under the leadership of commanders such as [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]] and [[Haji Abdul Qadir]]. Notable politicians and diplomats of the United Front included [[Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai]], [[Abdullah Abdullah]] and [[Massoud Khalili]]. From the Taliban conquest of Kabul in September 1996 until November 2001 the United Front controlled roughly 30% of Afghanistan's population in provinces such as [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], [[Kapisa Province|Kapisa]], [[Takhar Province|Takhar]] and parts of [[Parwan Province|Parwan]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]], [[Laghman Province|Laghman]], [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]], [[Ghor Province|Ghōr]] and [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]].

After longstanding battles, especially for the northern city of [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], Abdul Rashid Dostum and his Junbish forces were defeated by the Taliban and their allies in 1998. Dostum subsequently went into exile. Ahmad Shah Massoud remained the only major anti-Taliban leader inside Afghanistan who was able to defend vast parts of his territory against the Taliban.

In the areas under his control Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the [[Women's Rights]] Declaration.  In the area of Massoud, women and girls did not have to wear the Afghan burqa. They were allowed to work and to go to school. In at least two known instances, Massoud personally intervened against cases of forced marriage.

{{quote|It is our conviction and we believe that both men and women are created by the Almighty. Both have equal rights.

{{quote|Massoud is adamant that in Afghanistan women have suffered oppression for generations. He says that "the cultural environment of the country suffocates women. But the Taliban exacerbate this with oppression." His most ambitious project is to shatter this cultural prejudice and so give more space, freedom and equality to women – they would have the same rights as men.&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book"/&gt;|Pepe Escobar|Massoud: From Warrior to Statesman}}

Afghan traditions would need a generation or more to overcome and could only be challenged by education, he said. Humayun Tandar, who took part as an Afghan diplomat in the 2001 [[International Conference on Afghanistan, Bonn (2001)|International Conference on Afghanistan]] in Bonn, said that "strictures of language, ethnicity, region were [also] stifling for Massoud. That is why ... he wanted to create a unity which could surpass the situation in which we found ourselves and still find ourselves to this day." This applied also to strictures of religion. Jean-José Puig describes how Massoud often led prayers before a meal or at times asked his fellow Muslims to lead the prayer but also did not hesitate to ask a Christian friend Jean-José Puig or the Jewish [[Princeton University]] Professor Michael Barry: "Jean-José, we believe in the same God. Please, tell us the prayer before lunch or dinner in your own language."&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book"/&gt;

Human Rights Watch cites no human rights crimes for the forces under direct control of Massoud for the period from October 1996 until the assassination of Massoud in September 2001. 400,000 to one million Afghans fled from the Taliban to the area of Massoud.&lt;ref name="National Geographic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch-backgrounder-2001"&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/afghan-bck1005.htm#uf |title = Human Rights Watch Backgrounder, October 2001| publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2007 |url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/inside-the-taliban-3274/Overview |title=Inside the Taliban |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813110219/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/inside-the-taliban-3274/Overview |archivedate=August 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] concluded in its documentary ''Inside the Taliban'': "The only thing standing in the way of future Taliban massacres is Ahmad Shah Massoud."&lt;ref name="National Geographic"/&gt;

The Taliban repeatedly offered Massoud a position of power to make him stop his resistance. Massoud declined. He explained in one interview:

{{quote|The Taliban say: "Come and accept the post of prime minister and be with us", and they would keep the highest office in the country, the presidentship. But at what cost?!

The United Front in its [https://web.archive.org/web/20120310123118/http://www.peace-initiatives.com/frame.htm Proposals for Peace] demanded the Taliban to join a political process leading towards nationwide democratic elections. In early 2001, Massoud employed a new strategy of local military pressure and global political appeals. Resentment was increasingly gathering against Taliban rule from the bottom of Afghan society, including the Pashtun areas. Massoud publicized their cause of "popular consensus, general elections and democracy" worldwide. At the same time he was very wary not to revive the failed Kabul government of the early 1990s. Already in 1999, he started the training of police forces which he trained specifically in order to keep order and protect the civilian population in case the United Front would be successful.&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars"/&gt; Massoud stated:

{{quote|The Taliban are not a force to be considered invincible. They are distanced from the people now. They are weaker than in the past.

From 1999 onwards, a renewed process was set into motion by the Tajik Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Pashtun Abdul Haq to unite all the ethnicities of Afghanistan. While Massoud united the Tajiks, Hazara and Uzbeks as well as some Pashtun commanders under his United Front command, the famed Pashtun commander [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]] received increasing numbers of defecting Pashtun Taliban as "Taliban popularity trended downward". Both agreed to work together with the exiled Afghan king [[Zahir Shah]]. International officials who met with representatives of the new alliance, which Pulitzer Prize winner [[Steve Coll]] referred to as the "grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance", said, "It's crazy that you have this today ... Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazara ... They were all ready to buy in to the process ... to work under the king's banner for an ethnically balanced Afghanistan." Senior diplomat and Afghanistan expert [[Peter Tomsen]] wrote: "The 'Lion of Kabul' [Abdul Haq] and the 'Lion of Panjshir' [Ahmad Shah Massoud] ... Haq, Massoud, and Karzai, Afghanistan's three leading moderates, could transcend the Pashtun–non-Pashtun, north–south divide." The most senior Hazara and Uzbek leader were also part of the process. In late 2000, Massoud officially brought together this new alliance in a meeting in Northern Afghanistan to discuss, among other things, "a Loya Jirga, or a traditional council of elders, to settle political turmoil in Afghanistan".  That part of the Pashtun–Tajik–Hazara–Uzbek peace plan did eventually materialize. An account of the meeting by author and journalist [[Sebastian Junger]] says: "In 2000, when I was there ... I happened to be there in a very interesting time. ... Massoud brought together Afghan leaders from all ethnic groups. They flew from London, Paris, the USA, all parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India. He brought them all into the northern area where he was. He held a council of ... prominent Afghans from all over the world, brought there to discuss the Afghan government after the Taliban. ... we met all these men and interviewed them briefly. One was Hamid Karzai; I did not have any idea who he would end up being".&lt;ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars"&gt;{{cite book | last = Steve Coll| authorlink = Steve Coll| title =Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001 |edition=February 23, 2004 |page=558| publisher =Penguin Press HC | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tomsen-565&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomsen|first=Peter|title=Wars of Afghanistan|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-763-8|page=565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New Statesman"&gt;{{cite web |year=2011|url = http://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/2011/11/haq-afghanistan-taliban-kabul|title = The lost lion of Kabul| publisher = The New Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corbis"&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/AAEC001272/council-of-afghan-opposition?popup=1 |title = Council of Afghan opposition| publisher = Corbis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book 2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Marcela Grad| title = Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=1 March 2009 |page=65 | publisher = Webster University Press| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2001, Ahmad Shah Massoud with ethnic leaders from all of Afghanistan addressed the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] asking the [[international community]] to provide [[humanitarian]] help to the people of Afghanistan. He stated that the Taliban and [[Al-Qaeda]] had introduced "a very wrong perception of [[Islam]]" and that without the support of Pakistan and Bin Laden the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year. On this visit to Europe he also warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a large-scale attack on U.S. soil being imminent. The president of the European Parliament, [[Nicole Fontaine]], called him the "pole of liberty in Afghanistan".&lt;ref name="EU Parliament (2)"&gt;{{cite web|year=2001 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1iCsEnXdIw |title=Massoud in the European Parliament 2001 |publisher=EU media |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610222028/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1iCsEnXdIw |archivedate=June 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EU Parliament"&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78N6Q5VD60 |title = Massoud in the European Parliament 2001| publisher =EU media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gwu.edu"&gt;Defense Intelligence Agency (2001) report [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB97/tal32.pdf GWU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author="" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78N6Q5VD60 |title=see video |publisher=YouTube |date=2001-03-05 |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2001, Massoud, then aged 48, was the target of a [[suicide attack]] by two Arabs posing as journalists at Khwaja Bahauddin, in the [[Takhar Province]] of Afghanistan. Massoud, who had survived countless assassination attempts over a period of 26 years, died in a helicopter taking him to a hospital. The first attempt on Massoud's life had been carried out by Hekmatyar and two Pakistani ISI agents in 1975, when Massoud was only 22 years old. In early 2001, Al-Qaeda would-be assassins were captured by Massoud's forces while trying to enter his territory.&lt;ref name="Roy Gutman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/10/world/taliban-foe-hurt-and-aide-killed-by-bomb.html |title=Taliban Foe Hurt and Aide Killed by Bomb |location=Afghanistan |work=The New York Times |date=2001-09-10 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burns |first=John F. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/09/world/threats-responses-assassination-afghans-too-mark-day-disaster-hero-was-lost.html |title=Threats and responses: assassination; Afghans, Too, Mark a Day of Disaster: A Hero Was Lost |location=Afghanistan |work=The New York Times |date=2002-09-09 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral, though in a rather rural area, was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourning people.

The assassination of Massoud is believed to have a connection to the [[September 11 attacks]] on U.S. soil, which killed nearly 3000 people, and which appeared to be the terrorist attack that Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier. [[John P. O'Neill]] was a counter-terrorism expert and the Assistant Director of the [[FBI]] until late 2001. He retired from the FBI and was offered the position of director of security at the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] (WTC). He took the job at the WTC two weeks before 9/11. On September 10, 2001, O'Neill told two of his friends, "We're due. And we're due for something big. ... Some things have happened in Afghanistan. [referring to the assassination of Massoud] I don't like the way things are lining up in Afghanistan. ... I sense a shift, and I think things are going to happen ... soon."  O'Neill died on September 11, 2001, when the [[Two World Trade Center|South Tower]] collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boettcher|first=Mike|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/11/06/massoud.cable/index.html|title=How much did Afghan leader know?|publisher=CNN|date=2003-11-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820231434/http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/11/06/massoud.cable/index.html|archivedate=2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |year=2002 |url =https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/etc/script.html|title =The Man Who Knew | publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Massoud's United Front troops and United Front troops of Abdul Rashid Dostum (who returned from exile) ousted the Taliban from power in Kabul with American air support in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|Operation Enduring Freedom]]. From October to December 2001, the United Front gained control of much of the country and played a crucial role in establishing the post-Taliban interim government under Hamid Karzai.

====Prelude====
On 20 September 2001, U.S. president [[George W. Bush]], speaking to a joint session of Congress, tentatively blamed Al-Qaeda for the September 11 attacks; the president stated that the "leadership of Al Qaeda ha[d] great influence in Afghanistan and support[ed] the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country". Bush then said: "We condemn the Taliban regime", and went on to state, "Tonight the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban", which he said were "not open to negotiation or discussion":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/20/gen.bush.transcript/ |title=Transcript of President Bush's address |publisher=CNN |date=2001-09-21 |accessdate=2010-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819021954/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/20/gen.bush.transcript/ |archivedate=August 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/bushaddress_092001.html Text: President Bush Addresses the Nation] Washington Post, 20 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. petitioned the international community to back a military campaign to overthrow the Taliban. The U.N. issued two resolutions on terrorism after the September 11 attacks. The resolutions called on all states to "[increase] cooperation and full implementation of the relevant international conventions relating to terrorism" and specified consensus recommendations for all countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[:en:United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368|United Nations S.C.

The Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Salem Zaeef, responded to the ultimatum by demanding "convincing evidence" that Bin Laden was involved in the attacks, stating "our position is that if America has evidence and proof, they should produce it".  Additionally, the Taliban insisted that any trial of Bin Laden be held in an Afghan court. Zaeef also claimed that "4,000 Jews working in the Trade Center had prior knowledge of the suicide missions, and 'were absent on that day'."  This response was generally dismissed as a delaying tactic, rather than a sincere attempt to cooperate with the ultimatum.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Burns, John F.

On September 22, the [[United Arab Emirates]], and later [[Saudi Arabia]], withdrew recognition of the Taliban as Afghanistan's legal government, leaving neighbouring Pakistan as the only remaining country with diplomatic ties. On 4 October, the Taliban agreed to turn bin Laden over to Pakistan for trial in an international [[tribunal]]  that operated according to Islamic ''[[Sharia]]'' law, but Pakistan blocked the offer as it was not possible to guarantee his safety.  On October 7, the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan offered to detain bin Laden and try him under Islamic law if the U.S. made a formal request and presented the Taliban with evidence. A Bush administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, rejected the Taliban offer, and stated that the U.S. would not negotiate their demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.j-n-v.org/AW_briefings/ARROW_briefing005.htm |title=Briefing 05: The Smoking Gun |publisher=J-n-v.org |date=2001-10-08 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

====Coalition attack====
[[File:SF Sgt Mario Vigil with SF and NA forces west of Konduz in November 2001.jpg|thumb|The Taliban were removed from power in October 2001 by a unified effort of [[United Islamic Front]] (Northern Alliance) ground forces, small [[United States special operations forces|U.S. Special Operations teams]] and [[USAF|U.S. air support]].]]
On October 7, less than one month after the September 11 attacks, the U.S., aided by the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries including several from the NATO alliance, initiated [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|military action]], bombing Taliban and Al-Qaeda-related camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/10/07/gen.america.under.attack/ |title=Afghanistan wakes after night of intense bombings.

The CIA's elite [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) units were the first U.S. forces to enter Afghanistan (noting that many different countries' intelligence agencies were on the ground or operating within theatre before SAD, and that SAD are not technically military forces, but civilian paramilitaries). They joined with the Afghan United Front ([[Northern Alliance]]) to prepare for the subsequent arrival of U.S. Special Operations forces. The United Front (Northern Alliance) and SAD and [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] combined to overthrow the Taliban with minimal coalition casualties, and without the use of international conventional ground forces. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated in an editorial by John Lehman in 2006:

{{quote|What made the Afghan campaign a landmark in the U.S. Military's history is that it was prosecuted by Special Operations forces from all the services, along with [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] tactical power, operations by the Afghan Northern Alliance and the CIA were equally important and fully integrated. No large [[United States Army|Army]] or [[United States Marine|Marine]] force was employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/30/AR2006083002730.html|title=We're Not Winning This War|work=The Washington Post|date=2006-08-31 |accessdate=2009-12-03 | first=John | last=Lehman}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On October 14, the Taliban offered to discuss handing over Osama bin Laden to a neutral country in return for a bombing halt, but only if the Taliban were given evidence of bin Laden's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/waronterror/story/0,1361,573975,00.html |title=Taliban offers to hand bin Laden to a neutral nation for trial |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2012-09-02 |location=London |date=2001-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. rejected this offer, and continued military operations. [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] fell to United Front troops of [[Ustad Atta Mohammad Noor]] and Abdul Rashid Dostum on 9 November, triggering a cascade of provinces falling with minimal resistance.

In November 2001, before the [[Siege of Kunduz|capture of Kunduz]] by United Front troops under the command of [[Mohammad Daud Daud]], thousands of top commanders and regular fighters of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence agents and military personnel, and other volunteers and sympathizers in the [[Kunduz airlift]], dubbed the [[Airlift of Evil]] by US military forces around Kunduz and subsequently used as a term in media reports, were evacuated and airlifted out of [[Kunduz]] by Pakistan Army cargo aircraft to Pakistan Air Force air bases in [[Chitral]] and [[Gilgit]] in Pakistan's [[Northern Areas]].&lt;ref name="www_newyorker_com10"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news |first=Romesh |last=Ratnescar |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/10/10/timep.afghanistan.year.later.tm/index.html |title=Afghanistan: One year on |date=2002-10-10 |accessdate=2011-11-05 |work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www_msnbc_com11"&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Moran |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3340165 |title=The 'airlift of evil' |date=2001-11-29 |accessdate=2008-02-15 |publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=express&gt;{{cite web |last=[[Press Trust of India]] |url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=6813 |title=India protests airlift of Pakistani fighters from Kunduz |date=2002-01-24 |accessdate=2011-11-05 |work=[[The Indian Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news_bbc_co_uk12"&gt;{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=George |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1677157.stm |title=Kunduz celebrates end of siege |date=2001-11-26 |accessdate=2008-02-15 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=descent&gt;{{cite book |title=Descent into Chaos: The United States and the Failure of Nation Building in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Central Asia |last=Rashid |first=Ahmed |year=2008 |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[United States]] |isbn=978-0-670-01970-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of November 12, the Taliban retreated south from Kabul. On November 15, they released eight Western [[aid worker]]s after [[Attacks on humanitarian workers|three months in captivity]]. By November 13, the Taliban had withdrawn from both Kabul and [[Jalalabad]]. Finally, in early December, the Taliban gave up [[Kandahar]], their last stronghold, dispersing without surrendering.

====Targeted killings====
{{Main|Targeted killing}}
The United States has conducted [[targeted killings]] against Taliban leaders, mainly using [[Special Forces]], and sometimes [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s. British forces also used similar tactics, mostly in [[Helmand Province]], Afghanistan. During [[Operation Herrick]], British special forces [[assassinated]] at least fifty high and local Taliban commanders in targeted killings in Helmand Province, which received both positive and negative coverage in the British media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Larcombe|first1=Duncan|newspaper=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date={{date|February 11, 2010}}|accessdate={{date|23 September 2013}}|title=SAS assassinate Taliban commanders|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/campaigns/our_boys/2848942/SAS-men-and-Navy-SEAL-teams-take-out-top-50-Taliban-leaders.html|subscription=yes |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban also used targeted killings. In 2011 alone, they killed notable anti-Taliban leaders, such as former Afghan President [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]], the police chief in northern Afghanistan, the commander of the elite anti-Taliban 303 Pamir Corps, [[Mohammad Daud Daud]], and the police chief of Kunduz, Abdul Rahman Saidkhaili. All of them belonged to the Massoud faction of the United Front. According to Guantanamo Bay charge sheets, the [[United States Department of Defense]] believes the Taliban may maintain a 40-man undercover unit called "Jihad Kandahar", which is used for [[undercover operation]]s, including targeted killings.&lt;ref&gt;[[OARDEC]] (2008).

===Taliban resurgence after 2001===
{{Main|Taliban insurgency}}
{{Further|War in Afghanistan (2001–present)}}
After the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of 11 September 2001 on the United States]], Pakistan has been accused of continuing to support the Taliban, an allegation Pakistan denies.&lt;ref name=Barnes/&gt;&lt;ref name="CQ Researcher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Researcher|first=CQ|title=Issues in Terrorism and Homeland Security: Selections From CQ Researcher|year=2010|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-9201-5|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the fall of Kabul to anti-Taliban forces in November 2001, ISI forces worked with and helped Taliban militias who were in full retreat.  In November 2001, Taliban, Al-Qaeda combatants and ISI operatives were safely evacuated from Kunduz on [[Pakistan Army]] cargo aircraft to [[Pakistan Air Force]] bases in [[Chitral]] and [[Gilgit]] in Pakistan's [[Northern Areas]] (see [[Kunduz airlift]]). Former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf wrote in his memoirs that [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]], the former US deputy secretary of state, said Pakistan would be "bombed back to the stone-age" if it continued to support the Taliban, although Armitage has since denied using the "stone age" phrase.&lt;ref name=Lansford-37&gt;{{cite book|last=Lansford|first=Tom|title=9/11 and the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq: A Chronology and Reference Guide|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-419-1|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lall&gt;{{cite book|last=Lall|first=Marie|title=International security and the United States: an encyclopedia|year=2008|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-275-99254-5|page=10|edition=Volume 1|editor=Karl R.

[[File:Neotaliban insurgency 2002-2006 en.png|thumb|Development of a then-small Taliban insurgency in 2002 until 2006, the year which saw an escalation in Taliban attacks]]

In May and June 2003, high Taliban officials proclaimed the Taliban regrouped and ready for guerrilla war to expel US forces from Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="CSMontorTalibanResurge"&gt;{{cite news |title=Taliban appears to be regrouped and well-funded|author1=Tohid, Owias  |author2=Baldauf, Scott |lastauthoramp=yes |work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=8 May 2003|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0508/p01s02-wosc.html |accessdate=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chr.June2003&gt;{{cite web |title=Taliban regroups&amp;nbsp;– on the road|author=Tohid, Owias|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=27 June 2003|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0627/p06s01-wosc.html?related |accessdate=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar]] announced an insurgency against "America and its puppets" (i.e. [[Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan|transitional Afghan government]] forces) to "regain the sovereignty of our country".&lt;ref name=NYTNov2004&gt;{{cite news |title=Asia: Afghanistan: Taliban Leader Vows Return |last=Gall |first=Carlotta |work=The New York Times |date=13 November 2004 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E5DB173FF930A25752C1A9629C8B63 |accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2006, while according to American website ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'' Afghanistan faced "a mounting threat from armed Taliban fighters in the countryside", a US military truck of a convoy in Kabul lost control and plowed into twelve civilian vehicles, killing one and injuring six people. The surrounding crowd got angry and a riot arose, lasting all day ending with 20 dead and 160 injured. When stone-throwing and gunfire had come from a crowd of some 400 men, the US troops had used their weapons "to defend themselves" while leaving the scene, a US military spokesman said. A correspondent for the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in Kabul suggested that this was the outbreak of "a ground swell of resentment" and "growing hostility to foreigners" that had been growing and building since 2004, and may also have been triggered by a US air strike a week earlier in southern Afghanistan killing 30 civilians, where she assumed that "the Taliban had been sheltering in civilian houses".&lt;ref&gt;

The continued support from tribal and other groups in Pakistan, the drug trade, and the small number of NATO forces, combined with the long history of resistance and isolation, indicated that Taliban forces and leaders were surviving. [[Suicide attack]]s and other terrorist methods not used in 2001 became more common. Observers suggested that [[poppy]] eradication, which destroys the livelihoods of rural Afghans, and civilian deaths caused by airstrikes encouraged the resurgence. These observers maintained that policy should focus on "hearts and minds" and on [[economic reconstruction]], which could profit from switching from interdicting to diverting poppy production—to make medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In September 2006, Pakistan recognized the [[Islamic Emirate of Waziristan]], an association of [[Waziristan]]i chieftains with close ties to the Taliban, as the de facto security force for Waziristan. This recognition was part of the agreement to end the [[War in North-West Pakistan|Waziristan War]], which had exacted a heavy toll on the [[Pakistan Army]] since early 2004. Some commentators viewed [[Islamabad]]'s shift from war to diplomacy as implicit recognition of the growing power of the resurgent Taliban relative to American influence, with the U.S. distracted by the threat of looming crises in [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Iran]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Other commentators viewed Islamabad's shift from war to diplomacy as an effort to appease growing discontent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaces.brad.ac.uk:8080/display/ssispsru/Home |title=Pakistan Security Research Unit (PSRU) |publisher=Spaces.brad.ac.uk:8080 |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915030412/http://spaces.brad.ac.uk:8080/display/ssispsru/Home |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the Taliban's leadership structure, Mullah Dadullah's [[targeted killing|assassination]] in May 2007 did not have a significant effect, other than to damage incipient relations with Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Pashtun [[tribe|tribal group]], with over 40 million members (including Afghans and Pakistanis) had a [[Pashtun people#Pashtuns in the modern era|long history]] of resistance to occupation forces, so the Taliban may have comprised only a part of the insurgency. Most post-invasion Taliban fighters were new recruits, mostly drawn from local madrasas.

In December 2009, [[Asia Times Online]] reported that the Taliban had offered to give the US "legal guarantees" that it would not allow Afghanistan to be used for attacks on other countries, and that the US had given no response.&lt;ref name="atimes.com"/&gt;

==Condemned Taliban practices==

===Massacre campaigns===
According to a 55-page report by the [[United Nations]], the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic [[massacre]]s against civilians.  UN officials stated that there had been "15 massacres" between 1996 and 2001. They also said, that "[t]hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the [Taliban] Ministry of Defense or to [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] himself."  "These are the same type of war crimes as were committed in Bosnia and should be prosecuted in international courts", one UN official was quoted as saying. The documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in these killings. Bin Laden's so-called [[055 Brigade]] was responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians.  The report by the [[United Nations]] quotes "eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people". The Taliban's former ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, in late 2011 stated that cruel behaviour under and by the Taliban had been "necessary".&lt;ref name="Newsday 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="papillonsartpalace.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=31 December 2011 |url=http://www.tolonews.com/en/purso-pal/4847-cruel-behaviour-was-necessary-during-taliban-rule-zaeef-says |title=Taliban spokesman: Cruel behavior was necessary |publisher=Tolonews.com |date=2011-12-31 |accessdate=2012-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423154739/http://www.tolonews.com/en/purso-pal/4847-cruel-behaviour-was-necessary-during-taliban-rule-zaeef-says |archivedate=April 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the United Nations accused the Taliban of denying emergency food by the UN's [[World Food Programme]] to 160,000 hungry and starving people "for political and military reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=APAB&amp;d_place=APAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F8B4F98500EA0F8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Associated Press: U.N. says Taliban starving hungry people for military agenda |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date=1998-01-07 |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN said the Taliban were starving people for their military agenda and using humanitarian assistance as a weapon of war.

On August 8, 1998 the Taliban launched an attack on [[Mazar-i Sharif]]. Of 1500 defenders only 100 survived the engagement. Once in control the Taliban began to kill people indiscriminately. At first shooting people in the street, they soon began to target Hazaras. Women were raped, and thousands of people were locked in containers and left to suffocate. This [[ethnic cleansing]] left an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 dead. At this time [[1998 Iranian diplomats assassination in Afghanistan|ten Iranian diplomats]] and a journalist were killed. Iran assumed the Taliban had murdered them, and mobilized its army, deploying men along the border with Afghanistan. By the middle of September there were 250,000 Iranian personnel stationed on the border. Pakistan mediated and the bodies were returned to Tehran towards the end of the month. The killings of the Diplomats had been carried out by [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan|Sipah-e-Sahaba]] a Pakistani Sunni group with close ties to the ISI.  They burned orchards, crops and destroyed irrigation systems, and forced more than 100,000 people from their homes with hundreds of men, women and children still unaccounted for.&lt;ref name=Armajani-207&gt;{{cite book|last=Armajani|first=Jon|title=Modern Islamist Movements: History, Religion, and Politics|year=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-1742-5|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Riedel-66-7&gt;{{cite book|last=Riedel|first=Bruce|title=The Search for Al Qaeda: Its Leadership, Ideology, and Future|year=2010|publisher=Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-0451-5|pages=66–67|edition=2nd Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clements3&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Frank|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a historical encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-402-8|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gutman&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutman|first=Roy|title=How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Hijacking of Afghanistan|year=2008|publisher=Institute of Peace Press|isbn=978-1-60127-024-5|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tripathi&gt;{{cite book|last=Tripathi|first=Deepak|title=Breeding Ground: Afghanistan and the Origins of Islamist Terrorism|year=2011|publisher=Potomac|isbn=978-1-59797-530-8|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a major effort to retake the Shomali plains from the United Front, the Taliban indiscriminately killed civilians, while uprooting and expelling the population. Among others, Kamal Hossein, a special reporter for the UN, reported on these and other [[war crimes]]. In [[Istalif]], which was home to more than 45,000 people, the Taliban gave 24 hours' notice to the population to leave, then completely razed the town leaving the people destitute.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coburn&gt;{{cite book|last=Coburn|first=Noah|title=Bazaar Politics: Power and Pottery in an Afghan Market Town|year=2011|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0804776725|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the town of [[Bamian]] was taken, hundreds of men, women and children were executed. Houses were razed and some were used for forced labor. There was a further massacre at the town of [[Yakaolang]] in January 2001. An estimated 300 people were murdered, along with two delegations of Hazara elders who had tried to intercede.&lt;ref name=Maley2-240&gt;{{cite book|last=Maley|first=William|title=The Afghanistan wars|year=2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-80290-8|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clements4&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Frank|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a historical encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-402-8|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1999, the Taliban had forced hundreds of thousands of people from the Shomali Plains and other regions conducting a policy of scorched earth burning homes, farm land and gardens.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

===Human trafficking===
Several Taliban and al-Qaeda commanders ran a network of human trafficking, abducting women and selling them into sex slavery in Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Time Magazine"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,201892,00.html| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|title=Lifting The Veil On Taliban Sex Slavery|date=2002-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine writes: "The Taliban often argued that the restrictions they placed on women were actually a way of revering and protecting the opposite sex. The behavior of the Taliban during the six years they expanded their rule in Afghanistan made a mockery of that claim."&lt;ref name="Time Magazine"/&gt;

The targets for human trafficking were especially women from the Tajik, Uzbek, Hazara and other ethnic groups in Afghanistan. Some women preferred to commit suicide over slavery, killing themselves. During one Taliban and al-Qaeda offensive in 1999 in the Shomali Plains alone, more than 600 women were kidnapped.&lt;ref name="Time Magazine"/&gt; Arab and Pakistani al-Qaeda militants with local Taliban forces, forced them into trucks and buses.&lt;ref name="Time Magazine"/&gt; ''Time'' magazine writes: "The trail of the missing Shomali women leads to Jalalabad, not far from the Pakistan border. There, according to eyewitnesses, the women were penned up inside Sar Shahi camp in the desert. The more desirable among them were selected and taken away. Some were trucked to Peshawar with the apparent complicity of Pakistani border guards. Others were taken to Khost, where bin Laden had several training camps." Officials from relief agencies say, the trail of many of the vanished women leads to Pakistan where they were sold to brothels or into private households to be kept as slaves.&lt;ref name="Time Magazine"/&gt;

However, not all Taliban commanders engaged in human trafficking. Many Taliban were opposed to the human trafficking operations conducted by al-Qaeda and other Taliban commanders. Nuruludah, a Taliban commander, is quoted as saying that in the Shomali Plains, he and 10 of his men freed some women who were being abducted by Pakistani members of al-Qaeda. In Jalalabad, local Taliban commanders freed women that were being held by Arab members of al-Qaeda in a camp.&lt;ref name="Time Magazine"/&gt;

===Oppression of women===

The Taliban were condemned internationally for their [[Taliban treatment of women|brutal repression of women]]. In 2001 [[Laura Bush]] in a radio address condemned the Taliban's brutality to women.  In areas they controlled the Taliban issued edicts which forbade women from being educated, girls were forced to leave schools and colleges. Those who wished to leave their home to go shopping had to be accompanied by a male relative, and were required to wear the ''[[burqa]]'', a traditional dress covering the entire body except for a small screen to see out of. Those who appeared to disobey were publicly beaten. Sohaila, a young woman who was convicted of walking with a man who was not a relative, was charged with adultery. She was publicly flogged in [[Ghazi Stadium]] and received 100 lashes. The [[Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Afghanistan)|religious police]] routinely carried out inhumane abuse on women.  Employment for women was restricted to the medical sector, because male medical personnel were not allowed to treat women and girls. One result of the banning of employment of women by the Taliban was the closing down in places like Kabul of primary schools not only for girls but for boys, because almost all the teachers there were women.  Taliban restrictions became more severe after they took control of the capital. In February 1998, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul, and issued new regulations ordering people to blacken their windows, so that women would not be visible from the outside.&lt;ref name="Forsythe3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maley3"&gt;Dupree Hatch, Nancy.

===Violence against Afghan civilians===
According to the [[United Nations]], the Taliban and its allies were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009, 75% in 2010 and 80% in 2011.&lt;ref name="UNAMA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kegley&gt;{{cite book|last=Kegley|first=Charles W.|title=World Politics: Trend and Transformation|year=2011|publisher=Cengage|isbn=978-0-495-90655-1|page=230|author2=Shannon L Blanton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the Taliban's bombings and other attacks which have led to civilian casualties "sharply escalated in 2006" when "at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at non-combatants."&lt;ref name=hrw-cbceia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/04/16/afghan15688.htm |title=Human Rights News, Afghanistan: Civilians Bear Cost of Escalating Insurgent Attacks |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=2007-04-17 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/afghanistan0407/ |title=The Consequences of Insurgent Attacks in Afghanistan, April 2007, Volume 19, No. 6(C) |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=2007-04-16 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations reported that the number of civilians killed by both the Taliban and pro-government forces in the war rose nearly 50% between 2007 and 2009.  The high number of civilians killed by the Taliban is blamed in part on their increasing use of [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs), "for instance, 16 IEDs have been planted in girls' schools" by the Taliban.&lt;ref name="Arnoldy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0731/p06s15-wosc.html |title=In Afghanistan, Taliban kills more civilians than US |date= 2009-07-31 |author=Ben Arnoldy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Colonel [[Richard Kemp]], formerly Commander of British forces in Afghanistan and the intelligence coordinator for the British government, drew parallels between the tactics and strategy of [[Hamas]] in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] to those of the Taliban. Kemp wrote:

{{quote|Like Hamas in Gaza, the Taliban in southern Afghanistan are masters at shielding themselves behind the civilian population and then melting in among them for protection. Women and children are trained and equipped to fight, collect intelligence, and ferry arms and ammunition between battles. Female suicide bombers are increasingly common. The use of women to shield gunmen as they engage [[NATO]] forces is now so normal it is deemed barely worthy of comment. Schools and houses are routinely booby-trapped. Snipers shelter in houses deliberately filled with women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/analysis/analysis_280909_goldstone_kemp.html |title=The UN Goldstone Commission: A Lesson in Farcical Hypocrisy, Defense Update.

===Intimidating and murdering aid workers===
Taliban between 2008 and 2012 several times claimed to have assassinated Western and Afghani medical or aid workers in Afghanistan, either for fear of the vaccination of children against [[polio]], or for suspicion that the 'medical workers' were in truth spies, or for suspecting them to be proselytizing Christianity.

In August 2008, three Western women (British, Canadian, US) working for [[Humanitarian aid|aid group]] 'International Rescue Committee' were murdered in [[Kabul]]. Taliban claimed to have killed them because they were foreign spies.&lt;ref name="BBC, Oct008"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7679212.stm |title=UK charity worker killed in Kabul|publisher=BBC News |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, the British woman [[Gayle Williams]] working for Christian UK charity '[[SERVE Afghanistan|Serve Afghanistan]]' – focusing on training and education for disabled persons – was murdered near Kabul. Taliban claimed they killed her because her organisation "was preaching Christianity in Afghanistan".&lt;ref name="BBC, Oct008"/&gt;  In all 2008 until October, 29 aid workers, 5 of whom non-Afghanis, were killed in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="BBC, Oct008"/&gt;

In August 2010, the Taliban claimed to have murdered 10 medical aid workers passing through [[Badakhshan Province]] on the way from Kabul to [[Nuristan Province]] — but also Afghan Islamic party/militia [[Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin]] has claimed those killings. The victims were six Americans, one Briton, one German and two Afghanis, working for self-proclaimed "non-profit, Christian organization" called 'International Assistance Mission'. Taliban said they murdered them because of proselytizing Christianity, having Bibles translated in [[Dari language]] in their possession when they were encountered. IAM however contended afterwards that they "were not missionaries".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2010/08/hizbiislam_taliban_b.php 'Hizb-i-Islami, Taliban both claim killing 10 medical workers in northern Afghanistan'].  FDD's Long War Journal, 7 August 2010. Retrieved 5 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, unidentified gunmen killed four female UN polio-workers in [[Karachi]] in Pakistan; Western news media suggested a connection with the outspoken Taliban objections against and suspicions about such 'polio vaccinations'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/gunmen-kill-4-female-polio-workers-pakistan-091459457.html "Gunmen kill 4 female polio workers in Pakistan"] (18 December 2012), ''Yahoo! News'', The Associated Press. Retrieved 10 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually in 2012, a [[Pakistan]]i Taliban commander in [[North Waziristan]] in Pakistan banned polio vaccinations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban Block Vaccinations in Pakistan|author=Walsh, D.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/world/asia/taliban-block-vaccinations-in-pakistan.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 June 2012|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in March 2013, the Afghan government was forced to suspend vaccination efforts from the [[Nuristan Province]] because of a large Taliban influence in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban stopping polio vaccinations, says Afghan governor|author=Graham-Harrison, E.|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/12/taliban-stopping-polio-vaccinations-afghanistan|newspaper=Guardian|date=12 March 2013|accessdate=27 May 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But in May 2013, Taliban leaders changed their stance on polio vaccination, saying the vaccine is the only way to prevent polio and that they would work with immunisation volunteers so long as polio workers are "unbiased" and "harmonised with the regional conditions, Islamic values and local cultural traditions."&lt;ref name=poliotelegraph &gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban renounces war on anti-polio workers|author1=Babakarkhail, Z. |author2=Nelson, D. |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/10053981/Taliban-renounces-war-on-anti-polio-workers.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=13 May 2013|accessdate=27 May 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban pledge support for Afghan polio campaign|author=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/05/14/afghanistan-taliban-polio.html|newspaper=CBC News|date=14 May 2013|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
{{Islamism sidebar}}
{{Wikiquote|religious police}}

The Taliban's ideology has been described as an "innovative form of ''[[sharia]]'' combining Pashtun tribal codes,"&lt;ref name="Muslim World 2004"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World,'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Pashtunwali]], with radical [[Deobandi]] interpretations of Islam favored by JUI and its splinter groups. Also contributing to the mix was the [[militant Islamism]] and [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] [[jihadism]] of Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=132, 139}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their ideology was a departure from the [[Islamism]] of the anti-Soviet mujahideen rulers{{Clarify|reason=|date=October 2017}} they replaced who tended to be mystical [[Sufism|Sufis]], traditionalists,{{Clarify|reason=|date=October 2017}} or radical Islamism{{Clarify|reason=|date=October 2017}} inspired by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] (Ikhwan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to journalist [[Ahmed Rashid]], at least in the first years of their rule, the Taliban adopted Deobandi and [[Islamist]] anti-nationalist beliefs, and opposed "tribal and feudal structures," eliminating traditional tribal or feudal leaders from leadership roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban strictly enforced their ideology in major cities like [[Herat]], [[Kabul]], and [[Kandahar]]. But in rural areas the Taliban had little direct control, and promoted village [[jirga]]s, so it did not enforce its ideology as stringently in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

===(Deobandi) Islamic rules===
The Taliban regime interpreted the [[sharia law]] as to forbid pork, alcohol, music, many types of consumer technology such as television, filming and the Internet as well as most forms of art such as [[paintings]] or [[photography]], and female participation in [[sport]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldman, Amy&lt;/ref&gt; Men were forbidden to shave their beards, and required to wear a head covering.&lt;ref name="cr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/sa/8222.htm |title=US Country Report on Human Rights Practices – Afghanistan 2001 |publisher=State.gov |date=2002-03-04 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban emphasized dreams as a means of revelation.&lt;ref&gt;
Roy, Olivier, ''Globalized Islam'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like ''Wahhabi'' and other Deobandis, the Taliban do not consider [[Shia Islam|Shiites]] to be Muslims. The Shia in Afghanistan consist mostly of the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic group which totaled almost 10% of Afghanistan's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-03.htm#P186_38364 |title=Human Rights Watch Report, `Afghanistan, the massacre in Mazar-e-Sharif`, November 1998. |chapter=IV.

The Taliban were averse to debating doctrine with other Muslims. "The Taliban did not allow even Muslim reporters to question [their] edicts or to discuss interpretations of the [[Qur'an]]."&lt;ref name="rashid 107"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pashtun cultural influences===
The Taliban frequently used the pre-Islamic Pashtun tribal code, [[Pashtunwali]], in deciding certain social matters. Such is the case with the Pashtun practice of dividing inheritances equally among sons, even though the Qur'an clearly states that women are to receive one-half a man's share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwf.edu/atcdev/afghanistan/people/Lesson6Pastunwali.html|title=Peoples and Ethnic Groups – Pashtunwali: The Code|work=uwf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lubnaa.com/article.php?id=301|title=&lt;?php echo $header ?&gt;|website=www.Lubnaa.com|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ali A. Jalali and Lester Grau, the Taliban "received extensive support from Pashtuns across the country who thought that the movement might restore their national dominance. Even Pashtun intellectuals in the West, who differed with the Taliban on many issues, expressed support for the movement on purely ethnic grounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/990306-taliban.htm |title=Foreign Military Studies Office, "Whither the Taliban?" by Mr. Ali A.

===Bamyan Buddhas===
[[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|right|Taller Buddha in 1963 and in 2008 after destruction]]
In 1999, Mullah Omar issued a decree protecting the [[Buddhas of Bamyan|Buddha statues at Bamyan]], two 6th-century monumental statues of standing [[buddha]]s carved into the side of a cliff in the [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamyan]] valley in the [[Hazarajat]] region of central Afghanistan. But in March 2001, the statues were destroyed by the Taliban of Mullah Omar, following a decree stating: "all the statues around Afghanistan must be destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Luke Harding |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4145138,00.html |title=How the Buddha got his wounds|date=2001-03-03|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2010-08-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yahya Massoud, brother of the anti-Taliban and resistance leader [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], recalls the following incident after the destruction of the Buddha statues at Bamyan:

{{quote|It was the spring of 2001. I was in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, together with my brother [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], the leader of the Afghan resistance against the Taliban, and Bismillah Khan, who currently serves as Afghanistan's interior minister. One of our commanders, Commandant Momin, wanted us to see 30 Taliban fighters who had been taken hostage after a gun battle. My brother agreed to meet them.

I remember that his first question concerned the centuries-old Buddha statues that were dynamited by the Taliban in March of that year, shortly before our encounter. Two Taliban combatants from Kandahar confidently responded that worshiping anything outside of Islam was unacceptable and that therefore these statues had to be destroyed. My brother looked at them and said, this time in Pashto, 'There are still many sun- worshippers in this country. Will you also try to get rid of the sun and drop darkness over the Earth?'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Yahya Massoud |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/07/30/afghans_can_win_this_war |title=Afghans Can Win This War |date=July 2010 |work=Foreign Policy |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110042810/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/07/30/afghans_can_win_this_war |archivedate=January 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Consistency===
The Taliban ideology was not static. Before its capture of Kabul, members of the Taliban talked about stepping aside once a government of "good Muslims" took power and law and order were restored. The decision making process of the Taliban in Kandahar was modeled on the Pashtun tribal council (''[[jirga]]''), together with what was believed to be the early Islamic model. Discussion was followed by a building of a consensus by the believers.&lt;ref name="Rashid 2000 95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the Taliban's power grew, decisions were made by Mullah Omar without consulting the ''jirga'' and without Omar's visits to other parts of the country. He visited the capital, Kabul, only twice while in power.  Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Decisions are based on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us consultation is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the Sharia. We abide by the Amir's view even if he alone takes this view. There will not be a head of state. Instead there will be an Amir al-Mu'minin. Mullah Omar will be the highest authority and the government will not be able to implement any decision to which he does not agree. General elections are incompatible with Sharia and therefore we reject them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;Interview with Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil in Arabic magazine ''Al-Majallah'', 1996-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another evolution of Taliban ideology was Mullah Omar 1999 decree calling for the protection of the [[Buddhas of Bamyan|Buddha statues at Bamyan]] and the March 2001 destruction of them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4145138,00.html "How the Buddha got his wounds," ''Guardian'', 2001-03-03.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explanation of ideology===
The author Ahmed Rashid suggests that the devastation and hardship of the Soviet invasion and the following period influenced Taliban ideology.&lt;ref name="rashid 32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the Taliban did not include scholars learned in Islamic law and history. The refugee students, brought up in a totally male society, not only had no education in mathematics, science, history or geography, but also had no traditional skills of farming, [[herding]], or [[handicraft]]-making, nor even knowledge of their tribal and clan [[Kinship|lineages]].&lt;ref name="rashid 32"/&gt; In such an environment, war meant employment, peace meant unemployment. Dominating women simply affirmed manhood. For their leadership, rigid fundamentalism was a matter not only of principle, but also of political survival. Taliban leaders "repeatedly told" Rashid that "if they gave women greater freedom or a chance to go to school, they would lose the support of their rank and file."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
The Taliban have been criticized for their strictness toward those who disobeyed their imposed rules, and [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]]'s taking of the title of [[Amir al-Mu'minin]].

[[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] was criticised for calling himself [[Amir al-Mu'minin]] on the grounds that he lacked scholarly learning, tribal pedigree, or connections to the [[Prophet Mohammed|Prophet's]] family. Sanction for the title traditionally required the support of all of the country's [[ulema]], whereas only some 1,200 Pashtun Taliban-supporting Mullahs had declared Omar the Amir. According to Ahmed Rashid, "no Afghan had adopted the title since 1834, when King [[Dost Mohammed Khan]] assumed the title before he declared jihad against the [[Sikh]] kingdom in [[Peshawar]]. But Dost Mohammed was fighting foreigners, while Omar had declared jihad against other Afghans."&lt;ref name="rashid 41-42"/&gt;

Another criticism was that the Taliban called their 20% tax on truckloads of opium "[[zakat]]", which is traditionally limited to 2.5% of the zakat-payers' disposable income (or wealth).&lt;ref name="rashid 41-42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=41–42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taliban have been compared to the 7th-century [[Kharijites]] for developing extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819100539/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 August 2013|title=Wayback Machine|date=19 August 2013|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|author=Mohamad Jebara More Mohamad Jebara|work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular the Taliban have been accused of takfir towards Shia. After the August 1998 slaughter of 8000 mostly Shia Hazaras non-combatants at Mazar-i-Sharif,  Mullah Niazi, the Taliban commander of the attack and the new governor of Mazar, declared from Mazar's central mosque:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Last year you rebelled against us and killed us. From all your homes you shot at us. Now we are here to deal with you. The Hazaras are not Muslims and now have to kill Hazaras. You either accept to be Muslims or leave Afghanistan. Wherever you go we will catch you. If you go up we will pull you down by your feet; if you hide below, we will pull you up by your hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-03.htm#P186_38364|title=THE MASSACRE IN MAZAR-I SHARIF|website=www.HRW.org|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Overview===

The Taliban initially enjoyed goodwill from Afghans weary of the warlords' corruption, brutality, and incessant fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world / editor in chief, Richard C. Martin, Macmillan Reference USA : Thomson/Gale, c2004&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this popularity was not universal, particularly among non-Pashtuns.

In 2001, the Taliban, ''[[de jure]]'', controlled 85% of Afghanistan. ''[[De facto]]'' the areas under its direct control were mainly Afghanistan's major cities and highways. Tribal [[Khan (title)|khans]] and warlords had ''de facto'' direct control over various small towns, villages, and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 226.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Taliban-herat-2001 retouched.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Taliban police patrolling the streets of [[Herat]] in a pickup truck]]

Rashid described the Taliban government as "a secret society run by [[Kandahar]]is ... mysterious, secretive, and dictatorial."&lt;ref name="Rashid 2000 98"/&gt; They did not hold elections, as their spokesman explained:

{{quote|The ''[[Sharia]]'' does not allow politics or political parties. That is why we give no salaries to officials or soldiers, just food, clothes, shoes, and weapons. We want to live a life like the Prophet lived 1400 years ago, and jihad is our right. We want to recreate the time of the Prophet, and we are only carrying out what the Afghan people have wanted for the past 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=43}} Interview with Mullah Wakil, March 1996&lt;/ref&gt;}}

They modeled their decision-making process on the Pashtun tribal council (''[[jirga]]''), together with what they believed to be the early Islamic model. Discussion was followed by a building of a consensus by the "believers".&lt;ref name="Rashid 2000 95"/&gt; Before capturing Kabul, there was talk of stepping aside once a government of "good Muslims" took power, and law and order were restored.

As the Taliban's power grew, decisions were made by Mullah Omar without consulting the ''jirga'' and without consulting other parts of the country. He visited the capital, Kabul, only twice while in power. Instead of an election, their leader's legitimacy came from an oath of allegiance ("[[Bay'ah]]"), in imitation of the Prophet and the first four [[Caliph]]s. On April 4, 1996, Mullah Omar had "the Cloak of the Prophet Mohammed" taken from its shrine for the first time in 60 years. Wrapping himself in the relic, he appeared on the roof of a building in the center of Kandahar while hundreds of Pashtun [[mullah]]s below shouted "[[Amir al-Mu'minin]]!" (Commander of the Faithful), in a pledge of support. Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil explained:

{{quote|Decisions are based on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us consultation is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the ''Sharia''. We abide by the Amir's view even if he alone takes this view. There will not be a head of state. Instead there will be an Amir al-Mu'minin. Mullah Omar will be the highest authority, and the government will not be able to implement any decision to which he does not agree. General elections are incompatible with ''Sharia'' and therefore we reject them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;}}

The Taliban were very reluctant to share power, and since their ranks were overwhelmingly Pashtun they ruled as overlords over the 60% of Afghans from other ethnic groups. In local government, such as Kabul city council&lt;ref name="Rashid 2000 98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or Herat,&lt;ref name="rashid 39-40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=39–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taliban loyalists, not locals, dominated, even when the [[Pashto language|Pashto]]-speaking Taliban could not communicate with the roughly half of the population who spoke [[Dari language|Dari]] or other non-Pashtun tongues.&lt;ref name="rashid 39-40"/&gt; Critics complained that this "lack of local representation in urban administration made the Taliban appear as an occupying force."&lt;ref name="rashid 101-102"/&gt;

===Organization===
Consistent with the governance of early Muslims was the absence of state institutions or "a methodology for command and control" that is standard today even among non-Westernized states. The Taliban did not issue press releases, policy statements, or hold regular press conferences. The outside world and most Afghans did not even know what their leaders looked like, since photography was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "regular army" resembled a lashkar or traditional tribal [[militia]] force with only 25,000 men (of whom 11,000 were non-Afghans).

[[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] ministers and deputies were mullahs with a "[[madrasah]] education." Several of them, such as the Minister of Health and Governor of the State bank, were primarily military commanders who left their administrative posts to fight when needed. Military reverses that trapped them behind lines or led to their deaths increased the chaos in the national administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, "all senior [[Tājik people|Tajik]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] and [[Hazara people|Hazara]] bureaucrats" were replaced "with Pashtuns, whether qualified or not." Consequently, the ministries "by and large ceased to function."&lt;ref name="rashid 101-102"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=101–102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Finance had neither a budget nor "qualified economist or banker." Mullah Omar collected and dispersed cash without bookkeeping.

===Conscription===
{{Main|Taliban conscription}}
According to the testimony of [[Guantanamo captive]]s before their [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its [[civil service]].&lt;ref name="Flee Taliban"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Robyn|title=Afghans in Kabul Flee Taliban, Not U.S. Raids|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/oct/13/news/mn-56835|accessdate=11 December 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=13 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{See also|Economy of Afghanistan}}

The Kabul money markets responded positively during the first weeks of the Taliban occupation (1996). But the [[Afghan afghani|Afghani]] soon fell in value.  They imposed a 50% tax on any company operating in the country, and those who failed to pay were attacked.  They also imposed a 6% import tax on anything brought into the country,  and by 1998 had control of the major airports and border crossings which allowed them to establish a monopoly on all trade.  By 2001 the per capita income of the 25 million population was under $200,  and the country was close to total economic collapse.  As of 2007 the economy had begun to recover, with estimated foreign reserves of three billion dollars and a 13% increase in economic growth.&lt;ref name="Skaine1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lansford-147&gt;{{cite book|last=Lansford|first=Tom|title=9/11 and the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq: A Chronology and Reference Guide|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-419-1|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;{{cite book|last=Marsden|first=Peter|title=The Taliban: war, religion and the new order in Afghanistan|year=1998|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-85649-522-6|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pugh1&gt;{{cite book|last=Pugh|first=Michael C.|title=War Economies in a Regional Context: Challenges of Transformation|year=2004|publisher=Lynne Rienner|isbn=978-1-58826-211-0|page=48|author2=Neil Cooper Jonathan Goodhand }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Castillo&gt;{{cite book|last=Castillo|first=Graciana del|title=Rebuilding War-Torn States: The Challenge of Post-Conflict Economic Reconstruction|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-923773-9|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Skaine2&gt;{{cite book|last=Skaine|first=Rosemarie|title=Women of Afghanistan in the Post-Taliban Era: How Lives Have Changed and Where They Stand Today|year=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3792-4|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ANA soldier shows opium captured in an alleged Taliban safe house in Helmand.jpg|thumb|right|Opium in Taliban safehouse in [[Helmand]]]]
Under the Transit treaty between Afghanistan and Pakistan a massive network for smuggling developed. It had an estimated turnover of 2.5 billion dollars with the Taliban receiving between $100 and $130 million per year. These operations along with the trade from the [[Golden Crescent]] financed the war in Afghanistan and also had the side effect of destroying start up industries in Pakistan. [[Ahmed Rashid]] also explained that the Afghan Transit Trade agreed on by Pakistan was "the largest official source of revenue for the Taliban."&lt;ref name=Nojum1&gt;{{cite book|last=Nojum|first=Neamatollah|title=The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War and the Future of the Region|year=2002|publisher=St Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-29584-4|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nojum2&gt;{{cite book|last=Nojum|first=Neamatollah|title=The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War and the Future of the Region|year=2002|publisher=St Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-29584-4|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chouvy1&gt;{{cite book|last=Chouvy|first=Pierre-Arnaud|title=Opium: uncovering the politics of the poppy|year=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=|pages=52ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1996 and 1999 Mullah Omar reversed his opinions on the drug trade, apparently as it only harmed [[kafirs]]. The Taliban controlled 96% of Afghanistan's poppy fields and made opium its largest source of taxation. Taxes on opium exports became one of the mainstays of Taliban income and their war economy. According to Rashid, "drug money funded the weapons, ammunition and fuel for the war." In ''[[The New York Times]]'', the Finance Minister of the United Front, Wahidullah Sabawoon, declared the Taliban had no annual budget but that they "appeared to spend US$300 million a year, nearly all of it on war." He added that the Taliban had come to increasingly rely on three sources of money: "poppy, the Pakistanis and bin Laden."&lt;ref name="Chouvy1"/&gt;

In an economic sense it seems however he had little choice, as the war of attrition continued with the Northern Alliance the income from continued opium production was all that prevented the country from starvation. By 2000 Afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75% of the world's supply and in 2000 grew an estimated 3276 tonnes of opium from poppy cultivation on 82,171 hectares.  At this juncture Omar passed a decree banning the cultivation of opium, and production dropped to an estimated 74 metric tonnes from poppy cultivation on 1,685 hectares.  Many observers say the ban – which came in a bid for international recognition at the United Nations – was only issued in order to raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles.  The year 1999 had yielded a record crop and had been followed by a lower but still large 2000 harvest. The trafficking of accumulated stocks by the Taliban continued in 2000 and 2001. In 2002, the UN mentioned the "existence of significant stocks of opiates accumulated during previous years of bumper harvests." In September 2001 – before the 11 September attacks against the United States – the Taliban allegedly authorized Afghan peasants to sow opium again.&lt;ref name="Chouvy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaffer3&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Brenda|title=The limits of culture: Islam and foreign policy|year=2006|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-69321-9|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thourni&gt;{{cite book|last=Thourni|first=Francisco E.|title=The Organized Crime Community: Essays in Honor of Alan A.

There was also an environmental toll to the country, heavy deforestation from the illegal trade in timber with hundreds of acres of pine and cedar forests in [[Kunar Province]] and [[Loya Paktia|Paktya]] being cleared. Throughout the country millions of acres were denuded to supply timber to the Pakistani markets, with no attempt made at reforestation, which has led to significant environmental damage. By 2001, when the [[Afghan Interim Administration]] took power the country's infrastructure was in ruins, Telecommunications had failed, the road network was destroyed and Ministry of Finance buildings were in such a state of disrepair some were on the verge of collapse.  On July 6, 1999 then president [[Bill Clinton]] signed into effect executive order 13129. This order implemented a complete ban on any trade between America and the Taliban regime and on August 10 they froze £5000,000 in Ariana assets. On December 19, 2000 UN resolution 1333 was passed. It called for all assets to be frozen and for all states to close any offices belonging to the Taliban.  This included the offices of [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]].  In 1999 the UN had passed resolution 1267 which had banned all international flights by Ariana apart from preapproved humanitarian missions.&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Michael|title=Reaping the whirlwind: the Taliban movement in Afghanistan|year=2000|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1274-3|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wehr&gt;{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Kevin|title=Green Culture: An A-to-Z Guide|year=2011|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-9693-8|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rashid&gt;{{cite book|last=Rashid|first=Ahmed|title=Taliban: Islam, oil and the new great game in central Asia|year=2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-830-4|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clements&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Frank|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a historical encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-402-8|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Adam|title=Reconstructing Afghanistan|year=2005|publisher=International Monetary Fund|isbn=978-1-58906-324-2|page=29|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Farah&gt;{{cite book|last=Farah|first=Douglas|title=Merchant of Death: Money, Guns, Planes, and the Man Who Makes War Possible|year=2008|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-26196-5|page=146|author2=Stephen Braun }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Askari&gt;{{cite book|last=Askari|first=Hossein|title=Economic sanctions: examining their philosophy and efficacy|year=2003|publisher=Potomac|isbn=978-1-56720-542-8|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pillar&gt;{{cite book|last=Pillar|first=Paul R.|title=Terrorism and U.S. foreign policy|year=2003|publisher=Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-7077-0|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International relations==
During its time in power (1996–2001), at its height ruling 90% of Afghanistan, the Taliban regime, or "[[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]", gained [[diplomatic recognition]] from only three states: the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Saudi Arabia]], all of which provided substantial aid. The other nations including the [[United Nations]] recognized the government of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] (1992–2002) (parts of whom were part of the [[Northern Alliance|United Front, also called Northern Alliance]]) as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

[[Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman]], leader of the [[Pakistan]]i [[Islam]]ic ([[Deobandi]]) political party [[Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (F)]] (JUI), was an ally of [[Benazir Bhutto]], Pakistani prime minister in 1993–1996, and then had access to the Pakistani government, army and the ISI, whom he influenced to help the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) has since 1994 heavily supported the Taliban, while the group conquered most of Afghanistan in 1994–98.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraphgodfathers"&gt;{{cite news

Human Rights Watch writes, "Pakistani aircraft assisted with troop rotations of Taliban forces during combat operations in late 2000 and ... senior members of Pakistan's intelligence agency and army were involved in planning military operations."&lt;ref name=hrw-coi-2001&gt;{{cite report| url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3bd540b60.html | title=Crisis of Impunity|date = July 2001| publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan provided military equipment, recruiting assistance, training, and tactical advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frantz|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially Pakistan denied supporting the Taliban militarily.

Author [[Ahmed Rashid]] claims that the Taliban had "unprecedented access" among Pakistan's lobbies and interest groups. He also writes that they at times were able to "play off one lobby against another and extend their influence in Pakistan even further".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998–99, Taliban-style groups in Pakistan's Pashtun belt, and to an extent in [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]], "were banning TV and videos ... and forcing people, particularly women, to adapt to the Taliban dress code and way of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=93, 137}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the U.S. operation in Afghanistan the Afghan Taliban leadership is claimed to have fled to Pakistan where they regrouped and created several shuras to coordinate their insurgency in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/world/asia/21quetta.html?pagewanted=print |title =At Border, Signs of Pakistani Role in Taliban Surge | work = The New York Times | first=Carlotta|last=Gall|date=2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghan officials implied the Pakistani ISI's involvement in a July 2008 Taliban attack on the Indian embassy. Numerous U.S. officials have accused the ISI of supporting terrorist groups including the Afghan Taliban. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and others suggest the ISI maintains links with groups like the Afghan Taliban as a "strategic hedge" to help Islamabad gain influence in Kabul once U.S. troops exit the region.
U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen in 2011 called the [[Haqqani network]] (the Afghan Taliban's most destructive element) a "veritable arm of Pakistan's ISI".&lt;ref name="longwarjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas |last=Joscelyn |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2011/09/admiral_mullen_pakis.php |title=Admiral Mullen: Pakistani ISI sponsoring Haqqani attacks |work=The Long War Journal |date=2011-09-22 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/pakistan/isi-terrorism-behind-accusations/p11644 |title=The ISI and Terrorism: Behind the Accusations – Council on Foreign Relations |publisher=Cfr.org |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010, a report by a leading British institution also claimed that Pakistan's intelligence service still today has a strong link with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Published by the [[London School of Economics]], the report said that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) has an "official policy" of support for the Taliban. It said the ISI provides funding and training for the Taliban, and that the agency has representatives on the so-called [[Quetta Shura]], the Taliban's leadership council. It is alleged that the [[Quetta Shura]] is exiled in [[Quetta]].  The report, based on interviews with Taliban commanders in Afghanistan, was written by Matt Waldman, a fellow at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pape2&gt;{{cite book|last=Pape|first=Robert Anthony|title=Cutting the Fuse: The Explosion of Global Suicide Terrorism and How to Stop It|year=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-64560-5|page=142|author2=James K.

"Pakistan appears to be playing a double-game of astonishing magnitude," the report said. The report also linked high-level members of the Pakistani government with the Taliban. It said [[Asif Ali Zardari]], the Pakistani president, met with senior Taliban prisoners in 2010 and promised to release them. Zardari reportedly told the detainees they were only arrested because of American pressure. "The Pakistan government's apparent duplicity – and awareness of it among the American public and political establishment – could have enormous geopolitical implications," Waldman said. "Without a change in Pakistani behaviour it will be difficult if not impossible for international forces and the Afghan government to make progress against the insurgency." Afghan officials have long been suspicious of the ISI's role. [[Amrullah Saleh]], the former director of Afghanistan's intelligence service, told Reuters that the ISI was "part of a landscape of destruction in this country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6571VE20100608 | title=Afghan ex-intel chief opposed Karzai peace plan | date=2010-06-08 | agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (Pakistani Taliban)===
{{Main|Islamic Emirate of Waziristan|War in North-West Pakistan|Battle of Wana|Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan}}

Before the creation of the Tehrik-i-Taliban (Pakistan), some of their leaders and fighters were part of the 8,000 Pakistani militants fighting in the [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)|War in Afghanistan (1996–2001)]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)]] against the [[United Islamic Front]] and [[NATO]] forces.&lt;ref name="Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph" /&gt; Most of them hail from the Pakistani side of the Af-Pak border regions. After the fall of the Afghan Taliban in late 2001 most Pakistani militants including members of today's TTP fled home to Pakistan.

After the creation of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in 2007, headed by [[Baitullah Mehsud]],  its members have officially defined goals to establish their rule over Pakistan's [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]]. They engage the Pakistani army in heavy combat operations. Some intelligence analysts believe that the TTP's attacks on the Pakistani government, police and army strained the TTP's relations with the Afghan Taliban.&lt;ref name=Tighe-Katz&gt;{{cite news|author1=Tighe, Paul|author2=Katz, Ian|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Pakistan Challenges Taliban to Show Leader Mehsud Still Alive|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=akFq_Knl5Gd0|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2009-08-10|accessdate=2009-08-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720134650/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=akFq_Knl5Gd0|archivedate=2012-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=sanctionsunc/&gt;

The Afghan Taliban and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan differ greatly in their history, leadership and goals although they share a common interpretation of Islam and are both predominantly Pashtun.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Shane |title=Insurgents Share a Name, but Pursue Different Goals |date=2009-10-22 |publisher=The New York Times Company |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/world/asia/23taliban.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Afghan Taliban have no affiliation with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan and routinely deny any connection to the TTP. ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted a spokesman for the Afghan Taliban stating that:

{{quote|We don't like to be involved with them, as we have rejected all affiliation with Pakistani Taliban fighters ... We have sympathy for them as Muslims, but beside that, there is nothing else between us.&lt;ref name= gall2009327&gt;{{cite news |author =[[Carlotta Gall]], Ismail Khan, [[Pir Zubair Shah]] and Taimoor Shah|title=Pakistani and Afghan Taliban Unify in Face of US Influx |work=The New York Times|date=2009-03-26|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/world/asia/27taliban.html |accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is alleged that Afghan Taliban relied on support by the Pakistani army in the past and are still supported by them today in their campaign to control Afghanistan. Regular Pakistani army troops fought alongside the Afghan Taliban in the [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)|War in Afghanistan (1996–2001)]]. Major leaders of the Afghan Taliban including [[Mullah Omar]], [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]] and [[Siraj Haqqani]] are believed to enjoy or have enjoyed safe haven in Pakistan. In 2006 [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]] was allegedly called a 'Pakistani asset' by a senior official of Inter-Services Intelligence. Pakistan denies any links with Haqqani or other terrorist groups. Haqqani himself has denied any links with Pakistan as well.&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes 2008-09-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="George Washington University"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/world/asia/09iht-09pstan.15996896.html U.S. attack on Taliban kills 23 in Pakistan], [[The New York Times]], 2008-09-09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newser1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Spak |first=Kevin |url=http://www.newser.com/story/130046/haqqani-denies-link-with-pakistan.html |title=Haqqani Denies Link With Pakistan – And insists it didn't assassinate peace envoy Burhanuddin Rabbani |publisher=Newser.com |date=2011-10-03 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="armytimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2011/10/ap-haqqani-denies-links-pakistani-government-100311/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130117093139/http://www.armytimes.com/news/2011/10/ap-haqqani-denies-links-pakistani-government-100311/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-17 |title=Haqqani denies links to Pakistani government |work=Army Times |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="windsorstar1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mullen |first=Mike |url=http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=3d2d9649-7d20-47c9-9aaf-0330abc741a4 |title=Pakistan denies links to Haqqani network |publisher=Windsorstar.com |agency=Reuters |date=30 September 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002215555/http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=3d2d9649-7d20-47c9-9aaf-0330abc741a4 |archivedate=2 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tribune1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/265783/haqqanis-deny-killing-afghan-peace-envoy-bbc/ |agency=Agence France-Presse |title=Haqqani network denies links to ISI: BBC |work=The Express Tribune |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghan Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] asked the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in late 2008 and early 2009 to stop attacks inside Pakistan, to change their focus as an organization and to fight the [[Afghan National Army]] and [[ISAF]] forces in [[Afghanistan]] instead.  In late December 2008 and early January 2009 he sent a delegation, led by former [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay detainee]] [[Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul|Mullah Abdullah Zakir]], to persuade leading members of the TTP to put aside differences with Pakistan.&lt;ref name=gall2009327/&gt;

Some regional experts state the common name "Taliban" may be more misleading than illuminating.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;
Gilles Dorronsoro, a scholar of [[South Asia]] currently at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in Washington says:

{{quote|The fact that they have the same name causes all kinds of confusion.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;}}

As the Pakistani Army began offensives against the Pakistani Taliban, many unfamiliar with the region thought incorrectly that the assault was against the Afghan Taliban of Mullah Omar which was not the case.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;

The Pakistani Taliban were put under sanctions by [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]] for terrorists attacks in Pakistan and the [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]].&lt;ref name=sanctionsunc&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/report/unsc-slaps-sanctions-on-pakistani-taliban/20110730.htm UNSC slaps sanctions on Pakistani Taliban], July 30, 2011, rediff.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malakand Taliban===
Malakand Taliban is a militant outfit led by Sufi Muhammad and his son in law Molvi Fazalullah.  Sufi Muhammad is in Pakistani government custody, however, Molvi Fazalullah is believed to be in Afghanistan.  In the last week of May 2011, eight security personnel and civilians fell victim to four hundred armed Taliban who attacked Shaltalo check post in Dir, a frontier District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, located few kilometers away from Afghan border. Although, they have been linked with Waziristan-based Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the connection between these two groups was of symbolic nature.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a"&gt;{{cite web|first=Akbar |last=Mayo |url=http://outlookafghanistan.net/topics.php?post_id=828 |title=Rise of Malakand Taliban |publisher=The Daily Outlook Afghanistan |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===al-Qaeda===
[[File:Hamid Mir interviewing Osama bin Laden.jpg|thumb|Pakistani journalist [[Hamid Mir]] interviewing [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]] in Afghanistan, November 2001.]]
In 1996, bin Laden moved to Afghanistan from [[Sudan]]. He came without invitation, and sometimes irritated Mullah Omar with his declaration of war and fatwas against citizens of third-party countries,  but relations between the two groups improved over time, to the point that Mullah Omar rebuffed his group's patron Saudi Arabia, insulting Saudi minister [[Turki bin Faisal Al Saud|Prince Turki]] while reneging on an earlier promise to turn bin Laden over to the Saudis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=246–247, 287–288}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=288–289}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden was able to forge an [[military alliance|alliance]] between the Taliban and [[al-Qaeda]]. The al-Qaeda-trained [[055 Brigade]] integrated with the Taliban army between 1997 and 2001. Several hundred Arab and Afghan fighters sent by bin Laden assisted the Taliban in the [[Mazar-i-Sharif#1997–1998 civil unrest|Mazar-e-Sharif slaughter in 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=139}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1996 to 2001, the organization of Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become a virtual state within the Taliban state. The British newspaper [[Telegraph Media Group|''The Telegraph'']] stated in September 2001 that 2,500 Arabs under command of Bin Laden fought for the Taliban.&lt;ref name="Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1340244/Afghanistan-resistance-leader-feared-dead-in-blast.html |title =Afghanistan resistance leader feared dead in blast| publisher = Ahmed Rashid in the Telegraph| location= London| date= 2001-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taliban-al-Qaeda connections were also strengthened by the reported marriage of one of bin Laden's sons to Omar's daughter. While in Afghanistan, bin Laden may have helped finance the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&amp;id=1328# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311034029/http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&amp;id=1328%23 |archivedate=March 11, 2007 |df= }}, archived from [http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&amp;id=1328 the original]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818155310/http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&amp;id=1328 |date=August 18, 2006 }} on 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, [[Lawrence Wright]] claims bin Laden was almost completely broke at this time, cut off from his family income, and fleeced by the Sudanese.{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=222–223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] in Africa, [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists#Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]] and several al-Qaeda members were indicted in U.S. criminal court.  The Taliban rejected [[extradition]] requests by the U.S., variously claiming that bin Laden had "gone missing",  or that Washington "cannot provide any evidence or any proof" that bin Laden is involved in terrorist activities and that "without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin... he is a free man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/binladen/usbinladen1.pdf |title=Indictments |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324205702/http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/binladen/usbinladen1.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Bin Laden in turn, praised the Taliban as the "only Islamic government" in existence, and lauded Mullah Omar for his destruction of idols such as the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Embassy bombing defendant linked to bin Laden|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/LAW/02/14/embassy.bombing.02/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=February 14, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226122935/http://edition.cnn.com/2001/LAW/02/14/embassy.bombing.02/index.html|archivedate=2006-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?entity=osama_bin_laden |title=Cooperative Research records of evidence against bin Laden |publisher=Cooperativeresearch.org |accessdate=2012-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819140619/http://cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?entity=osama_bin_laden |archivedate=August 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

At the end of 2008, the Taliban was in talks to sever all ties with al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/10/06/afghan.saudi.talks/?iref=mpstoryview | publisher=CNN | title=Sources: Taliban split with al Qaeda, seek peace | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805103333/http://www.cnn.com/2001/LAW/02/14/embassy.bombing.02/index.html|archivedate=August 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Alex Strick van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn at New York University's Center on International Cooperation claimed that the two groups did not get along at times before the September 11 attacks, and they have continued to fight since on account of their differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Noel |last=Brinkerhoff |url=http://www.allgov.com/US_and_the_World/ViewNews/Surprise_Taliban_and_Al_Qaeda_are_Worlds_Apart_110209 |title=Surprise!

In July 2012, an anonymous senior-ranking Taliban commander stated that "Our people consider al-Qaeda to be a plague that was sent down to us by the heavens. Some even concluded that al-Qaeda are actually the spies of America. Originally, the Taliban were naive and ignorant of politics and welcomed al-Qaeda into their homes. But al-Qaeda abused our hospitality." He went on to further claim that about 70% of the Taliban are angry with al-Qaeda, revealing the icy relationship between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/taliban-commander-taliban-win-afghan-war-report/story?id=16753203 |title=Taliban Commander Says Taliban Cannot Win Afghan War: Report – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2012-05-02 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/07/preview-michael-semple-interviews-senior-member-taliban |title=Preview: Michael Semple interviews a senior member of the Taliban |publisher=New Statesman |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
Iran has historically been an enemy of the Taliban. In early August 1998, after attacking the city of [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], Taliban forces killed several thousand civilians{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} and [[1998 killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan|11 Iranian diplomats]] and intelligence officers in the Iranian consulate. Alleged radio intercepts indicate Mullah Omar personally approved the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=74–75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following crisis between Iran and the Taliban, the Iranian government amassed up to 200,000 regular troops on the Afghan-Iranian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John |last=Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/1998/09/wwwh8915.html |title=Iranian-Afghan tensions |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=1998-09-15 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; War was eventually averted.

Reports in which [[NATO]] states accused Iran of supplying and training some Taliban insurgents started coming forward since 2004/2005.

There are several sources as well stating the relationship between the Taliban and Iran in recent years. This said to occur from leadership change in the Taliban itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/27/mullah-mansour-iran-afghanistan-taliban-drone/|title=What Was Mullah Mansour Doing in Iran?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-Iran media outlets have also reported that the Taliban has included Shia [[Hazaras|Hazara]] fighters into its ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mobile.almasdarnews.com/article/shiite-hazara-gunmen-join-taliban/|title=Shi'ite Hazara gunmen join the Taliban|date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban have also condemned [[ISIS]] linked attacks on the [[Hazaras|Hazara]] Shia minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1205456|title=Afghan Taliban take apparent dig at IS over Hazara killings|author=AFP|date=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States never recognized the Taliban government in Afghanistan. However, Ahmed Rashid states that the U.S. indirectly supported the Taliban through its ally in [[Pakistan]] between 1994 and 1996 because Washington viewed the Taliban as anti-[[Iran–United States relations|Iranian]], anti-[[Shia Islam|Shia]] and pro-Western.  Washington furthermore hoped that the Taliban would support development planned by the U.S.-based oil company ''[[Unocal]]''. For example, it made no comment when the Taliban captured Herat in 1995, and expelled thousands of girls from schools. In late 1997, American Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] began to distance the U.S. from the Taliban, and the American-based oil company [[Unocal]] withdrew from negotiations on pipeline construction from Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=175–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=177}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/west_asia/38115.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=US pledges support for Afghan oil pipeline if Taliban makes peace |date=1997-12-10 |accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One day before the August 1998 capture of Mazar, bin Laden affiliates [[1998 United States embassy bombings|bombed two U.S. embassies]] in Africa, killing 224 and wounding 4,500, mostly Africans. The U.S. responded by launching cruise missiles on suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan, killing over 20 though failing to kill bin Laden or even many Al-Qaeda. Mullah Omar condemned the missile attack and American President [[Bill Clinton]]. Saudi Arabia expelled the Taliban envoy in protest over the refusal to turn over bin Laden, and after Mullah Omar allegedly insulted the Saudi royal family. In mid-October the U.N. [[Security Council]] voted unanimously to ban commercial aircraft flights to and from Afghanistan, and freeze its bank accounts worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, "Taliban blame Clinton scam for attacks", 1998-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=138, 231}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GIs burn a house described as a Taliban safehouse.jpg|thumb|upright|US soldiers burn a suspected Taliban safehouse.]]
Adjusting its [[counterinsurgency]] strategy, in October 2009, the U.S. announced plans to pay Taliban fighters to switch sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/10/28/afghanistan.taliban.pay/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=U.S. set to pay Taliban members to switch sides |accessdate=2010-04-09 |date=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--here--&gt;

On November 26, 2009, in an interview with [[CNN]]'s [[Christiane Amanpour]], President [[Hamid Karzai]] said there is an "urgent need" for negotiations with the Taliban, and made it clear that the Obama administration had opposed such talks. There was no formal American response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipsnews.net/text/news.asp?idnews=49701 |title=IPS Inter Press Service |publisher=Ipsnews.net |accessdate=2010-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055814/http://ipsnews.net/text/news.asp?idnews=49701 |archivedate=June 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2009/12/06/right-after-interviewing-karzai/ |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2010-04-09 |title=Right after interviewing&amp;nbsp;Karzai |date=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Asian Times Online reported that the Taliban had offered to give the U.S. "legal guarantees" that they would not allow Afghanistan to be used for attacks on other countries, and that there had been no formal American response.&lt;ref name="atimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/KL17Df02.html |title=Asia Times Online :: South Asia news, business and economy from India and Pakistan |work=Asia Times |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, U.S. officials indicated that they have not ruled out talks with the Taliban.  Several days later it was reported that Gates saw potential for reconciliation with the Taliban, but not with Al-Qaeda. Furthermore, he said that reconciliation would politically end the insurgency and the war. But he said reconciliation must be on the Afghan government's terms, and that the Taliban must be subject to the sovereignty of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Homan |first=Timothy R. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aUO6eLdxBxqo&amp;pos=9 |publisher=bloomberg.com |date=2009-12-06 |accessdate=2010-08-27 |title=Talks With Taliban Not Ruled Out, U.S. Officials Say (Update1) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613163056/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087 |archivedate=June 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/666993 |title=Pentagon sees reconciliation with Taliban |publisher=stuff.co.nz |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, General McChrystal said his troop surge could lead to a negotiated peace with the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=AFP |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iKXQC2HwynedmTU1YcjQQFpyPA_g |title=McChrystal focuses on peace with Taliban: report |publisher=Google |date=2010-01-24 |accessdate=2010-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128055633/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iKXQC2HwynedmTU1YcjQQFpyPA_g |archivedate=January 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
After the 9/11 attacks, the United Kingdom froze the Taliban's assets in the U.K., nearly $200 million by early October 2001.  The U.K. also supported the U.S. decision to remove the Taliban, both politically and militarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s380395.htm |title=AM Archive – UK freezes $200 million worth of Taliban assets |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Clements|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: A Historical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bv4hzxpo424C&amp;pg=PA154|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-402-8|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN agreed that NATO would act on its behalf, focusing on counter-terrorist operations in Afghanistan after the Taliban had been "defeated". The United Kingdom took operational responsibility for [[Helmand Province]], a major poppy-growing province in southern Afghanistan, deploying troops there in the summer of 2006, and encountered resistance by re-formed Taliban forces allegedly entering Afghanistan from Pakistan. The Taliban turned towards the use of [[improvised explosive devices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/onthefrontline/2171923/General-Sir-Michael-Jackson-We-must-maintain-our-will-in-Afghanistan.html |title=General Sir Michael Jackson: We must maintain our will in Afghanistan |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2008-06-21 |accessdate=2010-11-04 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2008 the United Kingdom announced plans to pay Taliban fighters to switch sides or lay down arms; the proceeding year the U.K. government supported negotiations with the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/2529278/British-cash-to-buy-off-Taliban-goes-to-farmers.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=British cash to buy off Taliban 'goes to farmers' |first=Nick |last=Meo |date=2008-08-09 |accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/8628150 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2010-04-09 |title=UK news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
India is one of the Taliban's most outspoken critics. India did not recognize the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and instead maintained close strategic and military ties with the [[Northern Alliance]] so as to contain the rise of Taliban during the 1990s. India was one of the closest allies of former Afghan president [[Mohammad Najibullah]] and strongly condemned his public execution by the Taliban. Pakistan and Kashmir-based militant groups thought to have ties with the Taliban have historically been involved in the [[Kashmir insurgency]] targeted against Indian security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawa.org/massoud.htm |title=Massoud joins hands with India |publisher=Rawa.org |date=1999-07-01 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen P.

In December 1999, [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]] en route from [[Kathmandu]] to [[Delhi]] was hijacked and taken to [[Kandahar]]. The Taliban moved its militias near the hijacked aircraft, supposedly to prevent [[Special Forces of India|Indian special forces]] from storming the aircraft, and stalled the negotiations between India and the hijackers for days. ''[[The New York Times]]'' later reported that there were credible links between the hijackers and the Taliban. As a part of the deal to free the plane, India released three militants. The Taliban gave a safe passage to the hijackers and the released militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/dec/07ter.htm |title=Bombay terrorist reveals links with IC 814 hijackers |publisher=Rediff.com |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GH30Df01.html |title=India reaches out to Afghanistan |work=Asia Times |date=2005-08-30 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the hijacking, India drastically increased its efforts to help Massoud, providing an arms depot in [[Dushanbe]], [[Tajikistan]].  India also provided a wide range of high-altitude warfare equipment, helicopter technicians, medical services, and tactical advice.  According to one report, Indian military support to anti-Taliban forces totaled US$70 million, including five [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters, and US$8 million worth of high-altitude equipment in 2001.  India extensively supported the new administration in Afghanistan,  leading several reconstruction projects and by 2001 had emerged as the country's largest regional donor.&lt;ref&gt;

In the wake of recent [[Terrorism in India|terrorist attacks in India]], there have been growing concerns about fundamentalist organisations such as the Taliban seeking to expand their activities into India. During the [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]] which was co-hosted in India, Pakistani Interior Minister [[Rehman Malik]] and Interpol chief [[Ronald Noble]] revealed that a terrorist bid to disrupt the tournament had been foiled; following a conference with Noble, Malik said that the Taliban had begun to base their activities in India with reports from neighboring countries exposing their activities in the country and a Sri Lankan terrorist planning to target cricketers was arrested in Colombo.

[[Russia]] has been accused of arming the Taliban by multiple politicians including [[Rex Tillerson]] and the Afghan government.&lt;ref&gt;https{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/22/russia-supplying-taliban-afghanistan|title=Russia accused of supplying Taliban as power shifts create strange bedfellows|first=Sune Engel|last=Rasmussen|date=22 October 2017|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no public evidence to substantiate such allegations, and several independent experts are skeptical that Russia materially supported the Taliban in any way.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/08/russia-taliban-weapons/537807/|title=Is Russia Really Arming the Taliban?|first=Krishnadev|last=Calamur|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=2017-08-25|accessdate=2018-08-28|quote=The U.S. claim—including those made in news reports—comes with no accompanying evidence, and the experts I spoke to said none of the open-source information they have seen suggest there is a direct link.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations and NGOs===
Despite the aid of [[United Nations]] (UN) and [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) given (see [[Taliban#Afghanistan during Taliban rule|§ Afghanistan during Taliban rule]]), the Taliban's attitude in 1996–2001 toward the UN and NGOs was often one of suspicion. The UN did not recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, most foreign donors and aid workers were non-Muslims, and the Taliban vented fundamental objections to the sort of 'help' the UN offered. As the Taliban's Attorney General Maulvi Jalil-ullah Maulvizada put it in 1997:

{{quote|Let us state what sort of education the UN wants. This is a big infidel policy which gives such obscene freedom to women which would lead to [[adultery]] and herald the destruction of Islam. In any Islamic country where adultery becomes common, that country is destroyed and enters the domination of the infidels because their men become like women and women cannot defend themselves. Anyone who talks to us should do so within Islam's framework. The Holy Koran cannot adjust itself to other people's requirements, people should adjust themselves to the requirements of the Holy Koran.&lt;ref&gt;Maulvi Jalil-ullah Maulvizada, June 1997 interview with Ahmed Rashid; {{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=111–112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 1998, the Taliban closed "all NGO offices" by force after those organizations refused to move to a bombed-out former [[Institute of technology|Polytechnic]] College as ordered.&lt;ref name=bmj /&gt; One month later the UN offices were also shut down.&lt;ref name=rashid,71 /&gt;

Around 2000, the UN drew up sanctions against officials and leaders of Taliban, because of their harbouring [[Osama bin Laden]]. Several of them Taliban leaders have subsequently been killed.&lt;ref name=telegraphJan2010 /&gt;

In 2009, British foreign secretary Miliband and US Secretary Hillary Clinton had called for talks with 'regular Taliban fighters' while bypassing their top leaders who supposedly were 'committed to global jihad'. Kai Eide, the top UN official in Afghanistan, however called for talks with Taliban at the highest level, suggesting [[Mullah Omar]]—even though Omar had recently dismissed such overtures as long as foreign troops were in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/un-official-calls-for-talks-with-taliban-leaders-news-international-jicuarhgaeb.html |title=UN official calls for talks with taliban leaders |publisher=sify.com |date=2 August 2009|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the U.N lifted sanctions on the Taliban, and requested that Taliban leaders and others be removed from terrorism watch lists. In 2010 the U.S. and Europe announced support for President Karzai's latest attempt to negotiate peace with the Taliban.&lt;ref name=telegraphJan2010&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7067537/UN-lift-sanctions-on-Taliban-to-build-peace-in-Afghanistan.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=UN: lift sanctions on Taliban to build peace in Afghanistan |first=Ben |last=Farmer |date=2010-01-25 |accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/01/25/UN-Reduce-Taliban-names-on-terror-list/UPI-69591264400185/ |title=UN Reduce Taliban names on terror list |agency=United Press International |date=2010-01-25 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/01/2010125185642602982.html |title=Asia News |publisher=english.aljazeera.net |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gorkha3.jpg|thumb|Gorkhali soldiers preparing war against Kathmandu Valley]]
Before the Shah dynasty took over [[Nepal]], it was limited to the [[Kathmandu Valley|Kathmandu valley]] and surrounding territories which consisted of many kingdoms. After conquering the valley in the mid-eighteenth century, King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] moved his ruling state to Nepal from [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]]. He then started his conquering campaign with the banner of Nepal than Gorkha. 

==Establishment of expanded Gorkha kingdom==
Gorkha was the kingdom which was small in size and was low in economic status. When Prithvi Narayan Shah became the king on 25 Chaitra 1799 he started unification of Nepal from 1800. Prithvi Narayan Shah wanted at first to attack over Nuwakot because Nuwakot durbar was at height so no one could attack easily. So he attacked over Nuwakot.

==Invasion in Nuwakot==
[[Nara Bhupal Shah]], the king of Nepal, had already tried to invade in [[Nuwakot, Bagmati|Nuwakot]] in 1794 B.S. At that time, Nuwakot was under the administrative control of Kantipur (today known as [[Kathmandu]]), so Kantipur supported Nuwakot during the invasion. After his defeat, Nara Bhupal Shah gave up all his efforts at unification and handed the administrative power over to [[Prithivi Narayan Shah]] and Chandraprabhawati (the eldest queen of Nara Bhupal Shah). Nara Bhupal Shah died in 1799 B.S. and Prithivi Narayan Shah ascended to the throne on Chaitra 25, 1799 B.S.

After his succession to the throne, he planned to begin a unification campaign by attacking Nuwakot in 1800 B.S. He sent Gorkhali troops, under Kaji Biraj Thapa, to attack Nuwakot. Biraj Thapa waited at Khinchet by the side of [[Trishuli River]] for an appropriate time to launch the attack. Prithivi Narayan Shah didn't like the strategy of Biraj Thapa and even didn't trust him because of the fault of reporting Maheshwor Panta. So, he sent another Gorkhali troops again under Maheshwor Panta. The troops under Maheshwor Panta were defeated.

After his conquest of the Kathmandu Valley, Prithvi Narayan Shah conquered other smaller territories south of the valley to keep other smaller fiefdoms near his Gurkha state out of the influence and control of British rule. After his kingdom spread from north to south, he made Kantipur the capital of expanded country which was known as Kingdom of Gorkha (Gorkha Samrajya).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/nepal/history&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bindloss2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Bindloss|title=Nepal 8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiIw2_WFwC4C&amp;pg=PA37|date=15 September 2010|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|isbn=978-1-74220-361-4|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan''' ({{zh|東突厥斯坦聯合革命陣線}}; '''URFET''') was a [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] group in [[Xinjiang]] that participated in the [[Xinjiang conflict]] as an armed separatist force. It was led by [[Yusupbek Mukhlisi]], who operated in-exile with other former URFET members in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Riots sparked off by public executions, says leader of exiles|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/riots-sparked-off-by-public-executions-says-leader-of-exiles-1.42035|date=12 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was allegedly supported logistically by the [[Soviet Union]] until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5I2b_hrJO8sC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=soviet+turkestan+people's+party&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dpQcU9iPN-fN0wHUrYCYAQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=soviet%20turkestan%20people's%20party&amp;f=false The ETIM: China's Islamic Militants and the Global Terrorist Threat - J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4014">'''UnitingCare Partnership''' is a consortium of [[Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust]] and [[Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]]

== Bid Award ==

The partnership was selected as the preferred bidder by Cambridgeshire and Peterborough [[Clinical Commissioning Group]] as Lead Provider of older people’s healthcare and adult community services, able to integrate services, with the intention providing more joined-up care for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UnitingCare Partnership chosen as preferred bidder for Cambridgeshire’s older people’s healthcare contract|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/UnitingCare-Partnership-chosen-preferred-bidder/story-23025347-detail/story.html|accessdate=2 October 2014|publisher=Cambridge News|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This decision came after a 15-month service design and procurement process and the partnership started delivering services on April 1, 2015.  Commonly NHS contracts are just one or two years in length. This contract was to be a five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preferred Bidder Chosen To Take Over Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Services|url=http://www.heart.co.uk/cambridgeshire/news/local/preferred-bidder-cambridgeshire-peterborough-nhs/|accessdate=2 October 2014|publisher=Heart Cambridgeshire|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julian Huppert]] MP for Cambridge welcomed the news that the new combined services for elderly people will be run by the NHS.  He said he wanted services to stay in the NHS, where the quality of health care is prioritised, as opposed to provision by private companies who have an obligation to generate a profit for their shareholders.

== Criticism of Bidding Process ==

The process of awarding the £800 million contract was criticised by campaigning group Stop the NHS Sell-Off, which is supported by [https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/stop-the-nhs-sell-off-in-cambridgeshire-and-peterborough 38 Degrees] who said the process cost £1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridgeshire's £800m NHS bid process 'unnecessary'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-29439924|accessdate=2 October 2014|agency=BBC News|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation plans to provide: 
* new neighbourhood teams to bring together community health, mental health, acute care and third sector providers into teams “built around general practices in local neighbourhoods”;
* a new “OneCall” service: a 24/7 single point of coordination, provided by [[South Central Ambulance Service]], which GPs or local clinicians can contact to arrange for urgent care for people most at risk of admission; and
a 24/7 urgent care, community based rapid response service, called the joint emergency team, provided by [[Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust]].

The contract provides seven domains against which its outcomes will be judged: patient experience; safe care; quality care; prevention; urgent care; long term care; and end of life care. Within these there are 62 indicators. Eventually 15% of the contract value will depend on performance against these indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New NHS company reveals outcomes based targets|url=http://www.lgcplus.com/news/health/social-care/new-nhs-company-reveals-outcomes-based-targets/5085245.article|accessdate=13 June 2015|publisher=Local Government Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contract Termination ==

On December 3, 2015 UnitingCare Partnership and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough [[Clinical Commissioning Group]] released a joint statement explaining that the contract was being terminated because they agreed it was no longer financially sustainable. The statement suggested that the service delivery model will continue for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambridgeshireandpeterboroughccg.nhs.uk/news-and-events/A_PR_728.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5836">'''White Terror''' ({{lang-el|Λευκή Τρομοκρατία}}) is the term used in [[Greece]], analogous to [[White Terror (disambiguation)|similar cases]], for the period of persecution of members of the [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party of Greece (KKE)]] and other former members of the leftist [[World War II]]-era [[Greek Resistance|resistance organization]] [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front (EAM)]] in 1945–46, prior to the outbreak of the [[Greek Civil War]].

== Background ==
During the [[Axis occupation of Greece]], the [[Communist Party of Greece|communist]]-dominated EAM-ELAS had become the major organization within the [[Greek Resistance]] movement. By the summer of 1944, with an estimated membership of between half and two million, and disposing of some 150,000 fighters, it dwarfed its nearest non-communist rivals, [[EDES]] and [[National and Social Liberation|EKKA]].{{sfn|Tucker|2013|p=155}}{{sfn|Stavrakis|1989|pp=11–14}}{{sfn|Clogg|1979|p=150}} The EAM-ELAS' provoked mounting tensions between itself and the other rival groups, divided by ideology as well as EAM-ELAS' ambition to be the sole instrument of "national liberation", led to repeated clashes in 1943–44, in what was later termed the "first phase" of the Civil War.{{sfn|Stavrakis|1989|pp=14–15}} 
At the time of Greece's liberation in October 1944, EAM-ELAS dominated the country except for the major cities, especially Athens, where British forces supported the returned [[Greek government in exile]]. As from the return of the exiled government, a new {{Interlanguage link multi|Government of National Unity headed by Georgios Papandreou|el|3=Κυβέρνηση Γεωργίου Παπανδρέου Εθνικής Ενότητος 1944}} was established in Greece, with the participation of [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|EAM]] and [[Communist Party of Greece|KKE]], according to {{Interlanguage link multi|Caserta Agreement|el|3=Συμφωνία της Καζέρτας}}. The internal disagreents of thw government, resulted  the withdrawal of [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|EAM]] and [[Communist Party of Greece|KKE]] by it. The  dormant rivalry between the Papandreou's government and EAM-ELAS resulted in the ''[[Dekemvriana]]'' clashes in Athens (December 1944 – January 1945), where EAM-ELAS was defeated, and the disarmament of the organization in the [[Treaty of Varkiza]] (February 1945).{{sfn|Rajak|2010|pp=203–204}}

== White Terror and outbreak of the Civil War ==
With EAM-ELAS neutralized, its members became easy prey for persecution by various right-wing groups in retaliation for the preceding "Red Terror".{{sfn|Rajak|2010|p=204}} These ranged from former members of the collaborationist Security Battalions to the government's paramilitary security services, chiefly the [[Greek Gendarmerie]] and the National Guard, acting with the government's tacit support. According to the left-wing view, "[w]hereas elsewhere in Europe prisons were flooded with fascists and their collaborators, in Greece most of the prisoners were members of leftist resistance organizations". According to the British Legal Mission in Greece, of the 16,700 prison inmates on 1 October 1945, 7,077 were common law criminals, 6,027 were left-wing prisoners imprisoned after the ''Dekemvriana'', and only 2,896 were collaborators.{{sfn|Voglis|2004|pp=143ff.}} The campaign of persecution lasted through 1945 and much of 1946, and was a critical element in the radicalization and polarization of the political climate in the country;{{sfn|Close|1995|pp=150ff.}} it led to the formation of leftist self-defence troops, the Left's boycott of the [[Greek legislative election, 1946|1946 election]], and finally the resumption of warfare with the outbreak of the second, or main phase, of the Greek Civil War in spring 1946.

The '''Worshipful Company of Wax Chandlers''' is one of the oldest [[Livery Company|livery companies]] of the [[City of London]], with one of the smallest memberships (about 120 members).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Leisure_and_culture/Local_history_and_heritage/Livery/ City Corporation of London Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wax Chandlers' Company, ranked 20th in the [[City of London|City]] [[Livery Companies#Precedence|Livery Company order of precedence]], has an association with the [[St Vedast alias Foster|Church of St Vedast alias Foster]] in nearby Foster Lane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedast.org.uk/the-parish/livery-companies.html www.vedast.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Established before 1330 (when it was recorded as being invited to contribute funds to [[Edward III|King Edward III]]) and possibly before 1199 (from when there is some documentary evidence, relating to a property in Aldersgate Street, of its existence as a body), the company received further Byelaws and Ordinances from [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]] John Stodeye in 1358. New Ordinances were issued in 1371 and the company was granted a [[Royal Charter]] in 1484 – one of only three known Royal Charters of [[Richard III of England|King Richard III]], the others being for the [[College of Arms]] and for the incorporation as a county borough of the city of [[Gloucester]]. The Company remains governed under its 1663 Royal Charter of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and corresponding [[Byelaws in the United Kingdom|Ordinances]] of 1664.

Wax chandlers (or merchants in [[beeswax]] [[product (business)|product]]s) traded separately from [[Worshipful Company of Tallow Chandlers|Tallow Chandlers]]; beeswax [[candle]]s, being expensive, were usually reserved for [[Church (building)|churches]] and the [[house]]holds of [[royal family|royalty]] and [[nobility]], while [[tallow]] candles were generally used in ordinary homes. In recent years, in February, the two companies have celebrated the Feast of [[Candlemas]] together.

==Company today==
As with many City Livery Companies today, the Wax Chandlers' Company no longer operates primarily as a [[trade association]].  Its role has evolved into being a civic, ceremonial, educational and charitable institution. Like other livery companies, it takes an active role in supporting the corporate governance of the [[City of London]] and the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor]].
The Company's current 'theme' is [[sustainability]], which it actively supports and promotes through, for example, a lecture series.

Examples of its [[Charity (practice)|charitable giving]] are its affiliation with Armed Forces units ([[HMS Protector]] and [[The Rifles|5 Rifles]]), the donation of candles to [[St Paul's Cathedral]] (every [[Feast of the Cross|Holy Cross Day]] in September), support to those in need throughout [[the City of London|the City]] and [[Greater London]] (particularly in the [[London Borough of Bexley]]), patronage of the [[National Honey Show]] and the [[Beekeeping in the United Kingdom|British Beekeeping Association]].

==Wax Chandlers' Hall==
The Company has maintained a Hall on the same site (6 [[Gresham Street]], [[London]]) since 1501. The Wax Chandlers' current premises, their sixth, were substantially rebuilt in 1954 after damage during [[World War II]]. Recently refurbished, the Hall is popular for hire on corporate or social occasions. Wax Chandlers' Hall can sometimes be viewed by the general public during the annual [[London Open House Weekend]] or by prior arrangement. The Company owns other property on Fleet Street in London.

==Membership==
The Wax Chandlers' membership comprises Liverymen and Freemen (who initially join the Company by [[Apprenticeship|servitude]] (as Apprentices), by [[Family patrimony|patrimony]], or by [[purchase|redemption]]). &lt;br/&gt;
The Company is governed by the Master Wax Chandler, Wardens (''Upper Warden'' and ''Renter Warden'') and a [[Court of Assistants]]. Election Court each June determines appointments to senior office, with ceremonial installation on or around the [[Feast of the Transfiguration]], in the first week of August.
&lt;br/&gt;The Company has supplied five [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayors of London]] since the 18th Century, including two in the 21st: [[Gavyn Farr Arthur|Sir Gavyn Arthur]] and Dame [[Fiona Woolf]] DBE.
&lt;br/&gt;The Company is administered by the [[Clerk]] and day-to-day management of the Hall is overseen by the [[Beadle]].

The Company's current membership includes: 
*The Rt Rev &amp; Rt Hon [[The Lord Williams of Oystermouth]] (Master of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]])
*Dame [[Fiona Woolf]] DBE (686th [[Lord Mayor of London]], former President of the [[Law Society of England and Wales]])

==Arms&lt;ref&gt;some material from Bromley and Child, ''The Armorial Bearings of the Guilds of London'' (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;==
[[File:Wax Chandlers' Arms - Shield.jpg|thumb|200px|left|&lt;center&gt;Wax Chandlers' Arms&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Company received a Grant of [[coat of arms|Arms]] from [[Sir]] Thomas Holme, [[Clarenceux King of Arms]], on 3 February 1485, the year following the [[College of Arms]]' foundation; the Charter of foundation of the [[College of Arms]] and that incorporating the city of Gloucester are the only known Charters of [[Richard III]] other than that which established the Wax Chandlers' Company. There were minor changes (grant of supporters and their modification), but not to the escutcheon or crest, in 1530 and 1536. &lt;br/&gt;
The Company’s extant [[Coat of arms|armorial bearings]], as confirmed in the Visitation of London in 1630, are [[blazon]]ed:

*'''[[Escutcheon (heraldry)|Shield]]''': Azure on a Chevron Argent three Roses Gules seeded Or between three Mortars royal Or. (A ''mortar'' is a type of candle-holder, similar to the mortar of a [[mortar and pestle|pestle-and-mortar]]; a mortar ''royal'' is particularly splendid.)
*'''[[Crest (heraldry)|Crest]]''': On a wreath Or and Gules a Maiden vested in a Surcoat of Cloth of Or furred with Ermine, kneeling among divers Flowers Proper and making thereof a Garland. 
*'''Mantling''': Azure doubled Ermine. 
*'''[[Supporter]]s''' ([[Grant of arms|grant]]ed in 1530, modified in 1536, but reverting to the 1530 version in 1630): On either side a Unicorn Argent gorged with a Garland of various Flowers Proper, the Horn wreathed Or and Gules.
