'''''A Tourist Guide To Lancre''''' is the third book in the ''[[Discworld]] Mapp'' series, and the first to be illustrated by [[Paul Kidby]]. As with the other maps, the basic design and booklet were compiled by [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[Stephen Briggs]].

The Mapp shows the mountain country of [[Lancre]], with the [[Ramtops]] drawn in a vertigo-inducing perspective shot, rather than as a relief diagram. The accompanying booklet details the history, geography and folklore of the country, with contributions from both [[Nanny Ogg|Gytha Ogg]] (anticipating the style of ''[[Nanny Ogg's Cookbook]]'') and Eric Wheelbrace, the [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]]'s most famous hillwalker (a parody of [[Alfred Wainwright]]).

'''Abraham Zacuto''' ({{lang-he|'''אברהם זכות'''}}, {{lang-pt|'''Abraão ben Samuel Zacuto'''}}, also '''Abraham ben Samuel Zacut''' and '''Abraham Zacut''') (Salamanca, August 12, 1452 – Damascus, probably 1515) was a Spanish [[astronomer]], [[astrologer]], [[mathematician]], rabbi and historian who served as Royal Astronomer in the 15th century to King [[John II of Portugal]]. The crater [[Zagut (crater)|Zagut]] on the Moon is named after him.

== Life ==
Zacuto was born in [[Salamanca]], [[Spain]] in 1452.&lt;ref name=chabas&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wUNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=Zacut&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=96edX7GNO_&amp;sig=348nB4Ne5KG4y-Ca7isgYR-R4bg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TeQ2SqO0JYncM6Ww6ZEN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7|title=Astronomy in the Iberian Peninsula | author=Chabas, Jose | author2=Goldstein, Bernard R  |pages=6–11 |chapter=Abraham Zacut:Supplemental Note for a Biography|publisher=Diane Publishing|date=2000 |isbn=0-87169-902-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may have studied and taught [[astronomy]] at the [[University of Salamanca]]. He later was for a time teacher of astronomy at the universities of [[Zaragoza]] and then [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Bensaude (1912): L'astronomie antique au Portugal á l'épogue des grandes
découvertes, pp. 6, 18–29&lt;/ref&gt; He was versed in [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], and was [[rabbi]] of his community.

With the general [[Alhambra decree|expulsion of the Jews]] from [[Spain]] in 1492, Zacuto took refuge in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. Already famous in academic circles, he was invited to court and nominated Royal Astronomer and Historian by King [[John II of Portugal]], a position which he held until the early reign of [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]]. He was consulted by the king on the possibility of a sea route to [[India]], a project which he supported and encouraged. Zacuto would be one of the few who managed to flee Portugal during the forced conversions and prohibitions of departure that Manuel I enacted, in order to keep the Jews in Portugal as nominal Christians for foreign policy reasons (see [[Expulsion of the Jews from Portugal]]). He fled first to [[Tunis]], and later moved to [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=chabas/&gt; He died probably in 1515 in Jerusalem, however, other reports indicate his final home was the Hebrew community of Damascus and the death occurred in 1520.&lt;ref name=chabas/&gt; However, in a similar vein to other giants of the Jewish faith, such as [[Saadia]], [[Maimonides]] and the [[Vilna Gaon]], he followed the extremely old Jewish custom (believed to have begun in Babylon) of being buried as close to Jerusalem as possible. Zacuto had established his wish to make his death pilgrimage at a Passover gathering.

Zacuto developed a new type of [[Mariner's astrolabe|astrolabe]], specialized for practical determination of [[latitude]] while at sea, in contrast to earlier multipurpose [[astrolabe|devices]] intended for use ashore. Abraham Zacuto's principal claim to fame is the great astronomical treatise, written while he was in Salamanca, in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], with the title ''Ha-ḥibbur ha-gadol'' ({{lang-he|'''החיבור הגדול'''}}) ("The Great Book"), begun around 1470 and completed in 1478.&lt;ref name = z&gt;"Zacuto, Abraham" in Glick, T., S.J. Livesy and F. Williams, editors, (2005) ''Medieval science, technology, and medicine: an encyclopedia'', New York Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; It was composed of 65 detailed astronomical tables ([[ephemeris|ephemerides]]), with [[radix]] set in year 1473 and the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] at Salamanca, charting the positions of the Sun, Moon and five planets.&lt;ref name = z/&gt;  The calculations were based on the [[Alfonsine Tables]] and the works of earlier astronomers (notably of the 14th-century [[Majorcan cartographic school|Majorcan school]]).  Zacuto set out the data in a simple "almanac" format, with the positions of a planet easily interpolated between entries, making it quite easy to use.&lt;ref name = z/&gt;

The first [[Spanish language|Castilian]] translation was undertaken in 1481 by Juan de Salaya.&lt;ref name = z/&gt;  Zacuto's Portuguese disciple Joseph Vizinus (Mestre [[José Vizinho]], the much-valued physician and advisor of John II of Portugal) adapted it into a [[Latin language|Latin]] translation, under the title ''Tabulae tabularum Celestium motuum sive Almanach perpetuum'' ("Book of Tables on the celestial motions or the Perpetual Almanac"), immediately along with a new [[Spanish language|Castilian]] translation, and arranged for its publication in 1496 by [[Abraão de Ortas]] in [[Leiria]], Portugal.&lt;ref name = z/&gt; (one of the first books published in Portugal with a movable type printing press).

Zacuto's ''Almanach perpetuum'' (or ''Biur Luhoth'') helped immediately revolutionize ocean navigation.  Prior to the ''Almanach'', navigators seeking to determine their position in the high seas had to correct for "compass error" (the deviation of the [[magnetic north]] from the [[true north]]) by recourse to the [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and the [[Pole Star]]. But this proved less useful as they approached the [[equator]] and the Pole Star began to disappear into the horizon. Zacuto's ''Almanach'' supplied the first accurate table of solar [[declination]], allowing navigators to use the sun instead.  As the quadrant could not be used to look directly at the sun, Portuguese navigators began using the [[astrolabe]] on board (an old land-based instrument to measure the height of the sun indirectly). Zacuto's tables in conjunction with the new metal nautical [[Mariner's astrolabe|astrolabe]] allowed navigators to take accurate readings anywhere.  Already in 1497, [[Vasco da Gama]] took Zacuto's tables and the astrolabe with him on the maiden trip to India.&lt;ref&gt;Although it took a little time to adapt.  [[João de Barros]] (1552) ''Decadas de Asia'' Dec. 1.2,[https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&amp;lr&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA280#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 280–81], relates how Vasco da Gama, arriving at the Bay of St. Helen in November 1497, disembarked to take the readings because he did not quite trust the new-fangled astrolabe on board. Physician-astronomer Master [[João Faras]], aboard the fleet of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], upon landing in [[Brazil]] in 1500, also complains about the astrolabe readings at sea.  But pilot [[João de Lisboa]] (writing c. 1514) indicates the use of astrolabe and tables were already perfected and routine.  See Albuquerque, Luís de, “Introdução”, in 1986 ed. of Abraão Zacuto, ''Almanach Perpetuum'', Lisbon: Imprensa Nacional Casa da Moeda&lt;/ref&gt;  It would continue to be used by Portuguese ships thereafter to reach far destinations such as [[Brazil]] and [[India]].

[[Vasco da Gama]] and his crew underwent a thorough briefing and preparation by Zacuto, in addition to learning to use the new instruments which he had developed for their trip before setting on the voyage to India in 1496. Prior to that, Zacuto had again improved on the existing astronomical tables, mostly those prepared under [[Alfonso X of Castile|King Alphonso X]] of Castille. Already [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] had used Zacuto's tables. The story is that on one of his voyages, when attacked by the natives, Columbus noted that Zacuto had predicted an eclipse for that day, and used this information to threaten the natives and convince them that he could extinguish the Sun and Moon and deprive them of all light. Zacuto's work thus saved the Admiral's life and that of his crew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/judaism/sefarad.html Astronomy in Sefarad]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham Zacuto might have an uncredited appearance in [[Luís de Camões]]'s 1572 epic poem, ''[[The Lusiad]]'', as the unnamed "old man of Restelo beach", a [[Cassandra]]-like character that surges forward just before [[Vasco da Gama]]'s departure to chide the vanity of fame and warn of the travails that await him  (Canto IV, v.94-111). This may be Camões' poetic interpretation of an alleged meeting (reported in [[Gaspar Correia]]) between Vasco da Gama and the older Abraham Zacuto at a monastery by [[Santa Maria de Belém (Lisbon)|Belém]] beach, just before his fleet's departure, in which Zacuto reportedly gave Gama some final navigational tips and warned him of dangers to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Gaspar Correia (c. 1550s) ''Lendas da India'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=XT8gAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.23])&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1504, while in [[Tunisia]], Abraham Zacuto wrote a history of the Jewish people, ''Sefer yuḥasin'' ({{lang-he|'''ספר יוחסין'''}}), since the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation of the World]] until 1500, and several other astronomical/astrological treatises. The ''History'' was greatly respected and was reprinted in Cracow in 1581, at Amsterdam in 1717, and at Königsberg in 1857, while a complete, uncensored,&lt;ref&gt;Dan Rabinowitz in ''Hakirah, The Flatbush Journal of Jewish Law and Thought'', [http://www.hakirah.org/Volume%202.htm volume 2 (fall 2015)], ''Nekkudot: The Dots that Connect Us'', p. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160305050901/http://hakirah.org/vol%202%20rabinowitz.pdf#page=16 64].&lt;/ref&gt; edition was published by Filipowski in London at 1857.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebrewbooks.org/5900 ''The Complete Yuchsin Book'', third edition (5723)]&lt;/ref&gt; Annotations in Hebrew to chapter five of "Sefer Hayuhasin", were published by Yoel Lieberman in 2001 in a masters thesis called "A Record of Medieval Sages In Sefer Yuchasin of Rabbi Abraham Zacut". The book was translated into English and published in 2005 by the Zacuto foundation founded by Dr. Vladimir Rozenblit, a 20th generation direct descendant of Zacuto.

'''Adrian Albert Mole''' is the fictional [[protagonist]] in a series of books by [[English literature|English author]] [[Sue Townsend]]. The character first appeared (as ''Nigel'') in a [[BBC Radio 4]] play in 1982. The books are written in the form of a diary, with some additional content such as correspondence. The first two books appealed to many readers as a realistic and humorous treatment of the inner life of an adolescent boy. They also captured something of the [[zeitgeist]] of the UK during the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher period]].

==Themes==
{{original research|section|date=December 2017}}
The series has many themes. The first books concentrate on Adrian's desires and ambitions in life (to marry his teenage sweetheart, publish his poetry and novels, obtain financial security) and his complete failure to achieve them. The series satirises human pretensions, and especially, in the first couple of volumes, teenage pretensions.

The second theme is depiction of the social and political situation in Britain, with particular reference to left-wing politics in the 1980s in the first three books. For example, Mr and Mrs Mole's divorce reflects rising divorce rates in the 1980s, and living together unmarried was becoming a norm. Adrian's mother becomes a staunch feminist and briefly joins the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp|Greenham Common]] campaigners. Pandora, Adrian's love interest, and her parents are part of an intellectualised and left-wing middle class that attempted to embrace the working class.

Humour arises from the outworking of larger social forces within a very ordinary household in a very ordinary part of [[Middle England]].

The last three books move in slightly new directions, showing Adrian as an adult in different environments. They have a stronger element of [[political satire]], mainly examining [[New Labour]], and in ''[[Adrian Mole and the Weapons of Mass Destruction|Weapons of Mass Destruction]]'', the [[Iraq War]]. The intervening book, ''[[Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years]]'', mixes these themes, with events such as the [[Gulf War]] seen from Adrian's naive and frustrated point of view, as well as depictions of his experiences of unemployment and public spending cutbacks, both major political issues at the time. In dealing with political events, a constant [[plot device]] is that Adrian makes confident predictions and statements that are known to be wrong by the reader, ranging from belief in the [[Hitler Diaries]] to an Iraqi victory in the Gulf War and the existence of their [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].

==Biography==
Adrian Albert Mole is born 2 April 1967, and grows up with his parents in the city of [[Leicester]]; he moves to [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] in England's [[East Midlands]]. Adrian's family are largely unskilled working class/[[lower middle class]]. He is an [[only child]] until the age of 15, when his half-brother Brett and half-sister Rosie are born. Adrian is not gifted academically but does tolerably well at school, though he does sometimes suffer the ire of headmaster "Pop-Eye" Scruton. Though not especially popular he has a small circle of friends and even a girlfriend Pandora Braithwaite (whose parents Ivan and Tania are affluent Trotskyites). At one point he falls into bad company with Barry Kent and his gang, who had bullied him in earlier years, but generally he keeps out of trouble. Throughout all this Adrian sees himself as an "intellectual" and a thwarted "Great Writer".{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Ironically Adrian actually ''is'' a good writer, as the quality of his diaries attests, but he feels he must adopt a "high" or [[avant-garde]] literary style to be taken seriously. His novel ''Lo! The Flat Hills of My Homeland'' is unsurprisingly never published: the few passages included in the diaries are painful to read (though Adrian himself regards them as "magnificent"), and the first few drafts were even written without vowels. Over several books he develops a script for a [[White van man|white van]] [[serial killer]] comedy programme which the [[BBC]] is reluctant to produce. Another of his works ''The Restless Tadpole: an Opus'' is described by one potential agent as "effete crap".

As a young man he moves to London and takes a job in a [[Soho]] restaurant catering to media types. London is going through a foodie renaissance and [[offal]] is all the rage. Adrian is persuaded to feature as a [[celebrity chef]] in a television cookery programme called ''Offally Good!''; although he is told the programme is a comedy, he typically fails to realise he is being set up as the stooge, the comic [[Wiktionary:straight man|straight man]]. He is contracted to write a book to accompany the show, but suffering from writer's block he eventually relies on his mother to write it for him.

He befriends an old pensioner called Archie Tait whilst he is living back at home with his mother. When Archie dies, Adrian goes to live in his old house, since Archie had no real ties. He finds out that Glenn Bott is his son and cannot pay Sharon all the money, so he cares for Glenn full-time. Glenn's remedial teacher, Eleanor Flood, a convicted arsonist, burns Archie's old house down.

Adrian ends up working in an [[antiquarian]] bookshop. Having lived in [[relative poverty]] for much of his life, and for some time in London in actual squalor, he overextends himself financially, lured by the banks' promises of easy credit, and buys a converted [[loft apartment]], at Rat Wharf. He is terrorized by swans, buys a talking fridge, and enjoys his newfound freedom as his children are "off his hands". Glenn is now in the British Army while William is living with his mother and Mole's ex-wife, Jojo, in Nigeria.

He gets caught up in a relationship with Marigold Flowers, a strange woman with a passion for dollshouses. He is attracted to her at first, but he likes her less each day and she costs him a lot of money. He tries and fails to end the relationship. Adrian's debt accumulates to such an extent that he owes £200,000 at one point.

Eventually Adrian moves into his parents' converted pigsties, along with Marigold's sister Daisy, whom he marries. The couple settle down and have a daughter Gracie, but Adrian's problems are far from over. He suffers the double tragedy of losing his new wife to the local squire while discovering that he himself has cancer. His loyal friend and co-worker Bernard Hopkins comes to the rescue, moving in with him and promising to remain until his cancer is in remission. Fortunately Adrian's cancer treatment is successful and Bernard leaves to pursue romance with a local widow, giving Adrian a pig as a farewell present. The final book ends with Adrian finding out he will be a grandfather and Pandora arriving outside the house.

===Family===
The Mole family is dysfunctional. Adrian's parents '''[[Pauline Mole|Pauline]]''' and '''[[George Mole]]''' are working-class characters with limited social mobility who drink and smoke heavily. Both are often unemployed; they have separated, divorced and remarried several times, often in the wake of extramarital affairs. In a reversal of a typical teenager-mother relationship, Pauline berates Adrian for keeping his room "like a bloody shrine". They move from [[Leicester]] to [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] with their dog (only ever referred to as "the dog", who is eventually replaced by "the new dog"). Adrian's paternal grandmother '''Edna May Mole''' is also prominent in the early diaries until her death in ''The Wilderness Years''.

Pauline first leaves George for their neighbour, Mr. Lucas, an insurance man. George fathers a second son, '''Brett''', by a lover, Doreen Slater, whom Adrian privately refers to as "Stick Insect". Brett makes a reappearance in the later books as a successful yet unpleasant businessman who loses his fortune during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|credit crunch]]. Doreen is killed off in ''Prostrate Years''. Pauline temporarily marries her younger lodger '''Martin Muffet''', who eventually leaves her for Adrian's girlfriend Bianca Dartington, giving Adrian and his mother a shared heartbreak. Later, George and Pauline effect a partner swap with Ivan and Tania Braithwaite (parents of Pandora), only to reunite after Ivan's untimely death.

Adrian's half-sister, '''[[Rosie Mole|Rosie Germaine Mole]]''' (after feminist [[Germaine Greer]]), grows up to be rebellious and street-smart, in contrast to Adrian. Despite opposing personalities, the siblings enjoy a close relationship, and Adrian often feels that she is the only family member who understands him. She also relies on him on occasion; when she becomes pregnant as a teenager, Adrian supports her decision to have an abortion.

Although the identity of Rosie's father is originally uncertain, in ''The Prostrate Years'' Mr Lucas, now wealthy, gets back in touch with Rosie and demands a DNA test on ''[[The Jeremy Kyle Show]]''. Adrian tries to talk his mother and Rosie out of informing George or appearing on the show, but they do so; the test proves that Mr Lucas is Rosie's father. As Rosie's relationship with her parents breaks down, she moves in with Mr Lucas and starts calling him "Dad" and herself "Rosie Lucas". Pauline also raises the possibility of Adrian's real father being a poetry-writing [[maggot]] farmer she dated before she married George, but Adrian decides not investigate. He thanks his father after learning that he raised him single-handedly during the first year of his life when Pauline was suffering from [[postpartum depression]].

It is mentioned that Adrian's [[middle name]], Albert, is after his paternal grandfather. However, in ''The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole'', it is stated that his name was Arnold, and as Arthur in ''Weapons of Mass Destruction''. However, he is simply called '''Grandad Mole'''. Adrian's [[maternal]] grandparents, the Sugdens, have never had their names revealed, although Pauline has two brothers, '''Dennis''' and '''Pete'''. Dennis married a woman called Marcia, and they had a son called Maurice, and Pete married a woman called Yvonne, who had died.. Grandma Sugden had died twenty years previously, as of ''The Lost Diaries''. Adrian's aunt, '''Susan Mole''', appears in most – if not all – of the books. Susan is a [[lesbian]] and prison warden at Holloway Prison. In earlier books, she is dating a woman called Gloria, but later is married to another woman called Amanda.

===Adrian's three children===
*'''Glenn Bott-Mole''', son of '''Sharon Bott''', whom Adrian knew at school and had an affair with as a young man. Sharon represents the [[underclass]] of British society. Glenn moves in with his father and it is revealed the boy has a lot of respect for him when Adrian sees the cover of his diary. He eventually joins the army and at the end of the last book is expecting a baby with his girlfriend, Finley-Rose.
*'''William Mole''', the son of his first wife JoJo, a Nigerian princess. She divorces Adrian and moves back home. Eventually William joins her, changing his forename to Wole to make it sound more African.
*'''Grace Pauline "Gracie" Mole''', the daughter of his second wife '''Daisy''' (née '''Flowers'''), a smart, successful PR career woman who resembles Nigella Lawson. Eventually she leaves him during his cancer episode for a thick aristocrat.

==Final volumes==
Production of sequels was interrupted by Townsend's declining health. At the time ''Adrian Mole – The Weapons of Mass Destruction'' was published in 2004, Townsend stated it would be the last Adrian Mole volume.  However, in an interview on Leicester hospital station Radio Fox on 5 June 2008, Townsend said that she was in fact writing a new Mole book entitled ''The Prostrate Years'', which was released in 2009. In October 2009 the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'' featured an interview with Townsend where she discussed the new Mole book and her plans for future works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/news/Adrian-Mole-battle-cancer/article-1451389-detail/article.html |title=Author Sue Townsend's new Adrian Mole book goes on sale |publisher=Thisisleicestershire.co.uk |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910234823/http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/news/Adrian-Mole-battle-cancer/article-1451389-detail/article.html |archivedate=10 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Townsend published a short Adrian Mole piece that tied into the wedding of [[Prince William]] and [[Kate Middleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/apr/17/adrian-mole-royal-wedding-diary|title=Adrian Mole's royal wedding diary, by Sue Townsend|author=Lamont, Tom|date=17 April 2011|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A very brief piece in which Adrian gave advice to writers followed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9027452/Adrian-Mole-recommends-books-for-would-be-writers.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Sue | last=Townsend | title=Adrian Mole recommends books for would-be writers | date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the last Adrian Mole works published in Townsend's lifetime, and the last original Mole stories to date.

In a 2013 interview, Townsend discussed her plans to wrap up the series in two further volumes, but also the fact that her continually declining health might make this plan impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9942147/Adrian-Mole-diaries-to-come-to-end-says-Sue-Townsend.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Alice | last=Vincent | title=Adrian Mole diaries to come to end, says Sue Townsend | date=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Townsend died on 10 April 2014. Her British publisher said the writer had been [[Unfinished creative work|working on a new Adrian Mole story at the time of her death]]. The book, which had the working title ''Pandora's Box'', was due for publication later in 2014. A spokesman for Michael Joseph said: "We can confirm that Sue was in the middle of writing the book. Her editor had seen what she describes as 'a few wonderful pages'. It was supposed to be out this autumn and we are very sad that we won't be able to show it to the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/14/sue-townsend-new-adrian-mole-novel|title=Sue Townsend was working on new Adrian Mole novel before her death|author=Irvine, Lindesay|date= 14 April 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==

*The books spawned three TV series. The first, ''[[The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole (TV series)|The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾]]'', was made by [[Thames Television]] for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network and broadcast between 16 September and 21 October 1985. The series featured a theme song "Profoundly in Love With Pandora" by [[Ian Dury]] and [[the Blockheads]] and starred [[Gian Sammarco]] as Adrian Mole with [[Julie Walters]] playing his mother and [[Lindsey Stagg]] as [[Pandora Braithwaite]]. The sequel, ''[[The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole (TV series)|The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole]]'' was broadcast between 5 January and 9 February 1987 with [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] replacing Julie Walters as Adrian's mother.  ''[[Adrian Mole: the Cappuccino Years (TV series)|Adrian Mole: the Cappuccino Years]]'' was broadcast on [[BBC One]] between 2 February and 9 March 2001, starring [[Stephen Mangan]] as Adrian Mole, [[Alison Steadman]] as Pauline Mole and [[Helen Baxendale]] as [[Pandora Braithwaite]].
*The character also featured in several radio series, such as ''[[Pirate Radio Four]]'' in 1985.
*A stage adaptation was written by Sue Townsend in 1984 of the first book – ''The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾: The Play'' with music and lyrics by [[Ken Howard (composer)|Ken Howard]] and Alan Blaikley. It starred [[Simon Schatzberger]] as Adrian Mole and [[Sheila Steafel]] as Pauline Mole. It was first performed at [[Phoenix Arts]], [[Leicester]] and went to [[Wyndham's Theatre]], London in December 1984.
*The first two books were adapted into [[interactive fiction|computer adventure games]] by [[Level 9 Computing]] in the 1980s.
*It has become a regular play throughout the world, e.g., the Roo Theatre in Australia
*A less well-known chapter of Adrian's life was chronicled in a weekly column called ''Diary of a Provincial Man'', which ran in ''[[The Guardian]]'' from December 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sue Townsend |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/adrianmole/article/0,,124422,00.html |title=Adrian Mole is now aged 32 &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; The Guardian |publisher=Books.guardian.co.uk |date= 27 January 2000|accessdate=7 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; to November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/adrianmole/0,,124404,00.html |title=Adrian Mole &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Books.guardian.co.uk |date= 22 July 2008|accessdate=7 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This material was published as ''[[The Lost Diaries of Adrian Mole, 1999-2001]]''. Set contemporaneously, as all the diaries are, it fills in two of the gap years between ''[[Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years]]'' and ''[[Adrian Mole and the Weapons of Mass Destruction]]''. Adrian spends this period living on a crime-ridden [[council estate]] with his sons, has an on-off romance with a woman named Pamela Pigg, and temporarily works in a lay-by trailer cafe. He befriends yet another pensioner who subsequently dies, and has a brief infatuation with his male therapist (which he insists is wholly spiritual, not homosexual). The series includes comment on the [[UK fuel protests#September 2000 protests|petrol crisis of 2000]], the [[9/11|9/11 attacks]] and the [[War on Terrorism]]. Adrian's illegitimate half-brother Brett Mole, born on 5 August 1982, is reintroduced as a 19-year-old; he is an athletic, popular, confident, promiscuous, super-intelligent Oxford undergraduate, already a published poet and TV documentarian – in short, the person Adrian always wanted to be. Brett's mediocre older sibling soon comes to regard him with envious loathing. In what was apparently supposed to be a retrospectively-written preface to the re-published Diaries, Mole notes their re-publication in novel-form and suggests that Townsend is impersonating him and profiting from his writings. He also claims that his life is still not as happy as he would like, but 'that is another story' – suggesting that there is another diary to come. This series of diaries is not normally considered as canonical.
*To mark the royal wedding between Prince William and Catherine Middleton, Sue Townsend wrote an exclusive Adrian Mole story for the Observer in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/apr/17/adrian-mole-royal-wedding-diary |title=Adrian Mole's royal wedding diary, by Sue Townsend |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date= 17 April 2011|accessdate=24 July 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An obscure chapter of Adrian's life appeared in the Christmas 1994 edition of the ''[[Radio Times]]''. Titled "Mole Cooks his Goose" it covered a stay by Adrian and Jojo at his mother's house over Christmas. It has never been republished.
*A new stage musical adaptation by [[Jake Brunger and Pippa Cleary]] opened at Leicester's [[Curve Theatre, Leicester|Curve]] in March 2015. Townsend had been working with the writers on the project at the time of her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10952603/Adrian-Mole-the-musical-Sue-Townsends-last-hurrah.html |title=Sue Townsend's last hurrah |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date= 8 July 2014|accessdate=7 August 2014 | location=London |first=Hannah |last=Furness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annamarie Castrilli''' (born 1949) is a former [[politician]] in [[Ontario]], Canada. A lawyer, and university lecturer, she sat on several boards of directors, including being the chair of the [[University of Toronto]]'s Governing Council.  She was first elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] in the 1995 [[Ontario general election, 1995|Ontario general election]] as a [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]], and served as a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) through June 1999. In 1996, she ran for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party, but finished sixth. After losing a nomination battle in her newly constituted constituency, she crossed the floor to the governing [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservatives]] on the day the [[Ontario general election, 1999|1999 Ontario general election]] was called. She ran in that campaign as a Conservative candidate in [[Parkdale—High Park (provincial electoral district)|Parkdale—High Park]], but lost to one of her fellow Liberal leadership contenders, [[Gerard Kennedy]]. She has not run for public office since.

==Background==
Castrilli was educated at the [[University of Toronto]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1969, a [[Master of Arts]] degree in 1970, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="Star Bio"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Lisa|title=Trilingual lawyer defies gender jinx|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=1996-10-16|location=Toronto|page=A21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She subsequently attended [[Osgoode Hall Law School]], receiving an [[LL.B.]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="UofT Bio"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biographical Sketches. "Elsa Amadio, Annamarie Castrilli and Maria Minna|journal=Italian Canadiana|year=1995|volume=11|pages=10–16|publisher=Frank Iacobucci Centre for Italian Canadian Studies, University of Toronto|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She worked as an Associate Lawyer with the firm of Harries, Hauser, Loudon &amp; Syron from 1985 to 1989 and was a Tax Partner with Bratty and Partners in 1990.  From 1991 to 1995, she ran a private practice as a corporate lawyer.&lt;ref name="Star Bio"/&gt;

Castrilli also served on the Governing Council of the University of Toronto from 1989 to 1995 (including two years as Chair), was a trustee with the [[Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre|Sunnybrook Hospital]] from 1993 to 1995, and was a director of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], also from 1993 to 1995.&lt;ref name="Star Bio"/&gt;   She was a founding member of the ''Italian Canadian Women's Alliance'' in 1976, and of the ''Women's Intercultural Council'' in 1988.  Before entering politics, she had written several articles on multiculturalism, women's issues and human rights.&lt;ref name="UofT Bio"/&gt;

==Politics==
In the [[Ontario general election, 1995|provincial election of 1995]], Castrilli was elected as a Liberal in the northwest [[Toronto]] riding of [[Downsview (electoral district)|Downsview]], defeating incumbent [[Ontario New Democratic Party|New Democrat]] [[Anthony Perruzza]] by 360 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Summary of Valid Ballots by Candidate: Downsview |url=http://results.elections.on.ca/results/1995_results/valid_votes.jsp?e_code=36 |work=General Election of 1995 |publisher=Elections Ontario |accessdate=2011-04-28 |author=Chief Returning Officer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yI0KxRYp?url=http://results.elections.on.ca/results/1995_results/valid_votes.jsp?e_code=36&amp;rec=0&amp;district=Downsview&amp;flag=E&amp;layout=G |archivedate=2011-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The general election was won by the Progressive Conservatives, and Castrilli became the Opposition Critic for Colleges and Universities, also serving as Associate Critic to the [[Attorney General of Ontario|Attorney-General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Annamaria Castrilli, MPP |url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/members/members_all_detail.do?locale=en |work=Past and Present MPPs |publisher=Legislative Assembly of Ontario |accessdate=2011-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yI0V8ONd?url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/members/members_all_detail.do?locale=en&amp;ID=322 |archivedate=2011-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fellow Liberals MPPs soon dubbed her "La Contessa" because of her patrician demeanour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crone|first=Greg|title=Liberals gather to pick leader: Convention could see last old-style wheeling, dealing|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/510714941.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+29%2C+1996&amp;author=Greg+Crone&amp;pub=The+Spectator&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=D.10&amp;desc=Liberals+gather+to+pick+leader%3A+Convention+could+see+last+old-style+wheeling%2C+dealing|accessdate=2011-04-28|newspaper=The Hamilton Spectator|date=1996-11-29|page=D10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Lyn McLeod]] resigned as Liberal leader in 1996, Castrilli entered the race to succeed her.  Her candidacy did not receive widespread support, and she placed sixth of out seven candidates on the first ballot.  Castrilli initially withdrew from the contest but changed her mind a few minutes later, causing a delay in the voting process as the ballots needed to be reprinted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toughhill|first=Kelly|title=Convention snarled by 'ridiculous' foul-ups|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=1996-12-01|location=Toronto|pages=A1,A6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She again placed sixth and was forced out of the contest, giving her support to eventual winner [[Dalton McGuinty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walkom|first=Thomas|title=Marathon vote reveals splits, pettiness in party|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=1996-12-01|location=Toronto|page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (See [[Ontario Liberal Leadership Conventions]].)

Castrilli initially planned to run as a Liberal in the [[Ontario general election, 1999|1999 provincial election]], but was defeated for the party's nomination in [[York Centre (provincial electoral district)|York Centre]] by fellow caucus member [[Monte Kwinter]].&lt;ref name="Rusk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rusk|first=James|title=MPP quits Liberals to enter Tory race|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=1999-05-06|author2=Immen, Wallace|page=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Progressive Conservative government had previously reduced the number of constituencies from 130 to 103, forcing several incumbent [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Members of Provincial Parliament]] (MPPs) to compete against one another for renomination.&lt;ref name="Urquhart"&gt;{{cite news|last=Urquhart|first=Ian|title=Lots of ego in nasty Liberal riding fight|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=1997-07-12|page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the last sitting day of the legislature, Castrilli [[crossed the floor]] to sit as a Progressive Conservative.&lt;ref name="Rusk"/&gt; She won the PC nomination in the [[Parkdale—High Park (provincial electoral district)|Parkdale—High Park]] constituency, and faced high-profile Liberal MPP [[Gerard Kennedy]] in the general election.&lt;ref name="Rusk"/&gt;  Kennedy and Castrilli were both candidates for the Liberal party leadership in 1996; she placed sixth while he finished second to McGuinty in the leadership contest.&lt;ref name="Rusk"/&gt;   One of Castrilli's most prominent supporters was [[John Nunziata]], an Independent member of the [[House of Commons of Canada]] who had left the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in 1996.

The contest between Kennedy and Castrilli was expected to be close, but it was not when Kennedy won with 23,030 votes, while Castrilli received 12,699.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Murray|title=Party defections add some spice to Parkdale|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=1999-05-26|page=A7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parkdale–High Park Results |url=http://results.elections.on.ca/results/1999_results/valid_votes.jsp?e_code=37&amp;rec=0&amp;district_code=64&amp;flag=E&amp;layout=G |work=Summary of Valid Ballots by Candidate |publisher=Elections Ontario |accessdate=2011-04-23 |author=Chief Returning Officer of Ontario |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317051953/http://results.elections.on.ca/results/1999_results/valid_votes.jsp?e_code=37&amp;rec=0&amp;district_code=64&amp;flag=E&amp;layout=G |archivedate=2012-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
She subsequently created "Partnership with Ontarians" to promote the province for international business, and is now a member of SEADAC Strategic Consultants.

In the [[Canadian general election, 2004|federal election of 2004]], Castrilli supported [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] candidate Michael Mostyn.  Later in the year, she was co-chair of [[Jim Flaherty]]'s unsuccessful [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leadership election, 2004|bid to lead the provincial Tories]].

'''''Bodil Lindqvist v Åklagarkammaren i Jönköping''''' (2003) is a decision by the [[Court of Justice of the European Communities]] (European Court of Justice).

The first substantial work on the subject was [[Alfred Bonnardot]]'s ''Essai sur l'art de Restaurer les Estampes et les Livres'' which was first published in Paris in 1846.  Further significant developments occurred as a result of specific events including the 1904 fire at the [[Turin National University Library]] and the [[1966 flood of the Arno]] which damaged over a million items in the [[National Central Library (Florence)|National Central Library]] in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=61 |title=Solving Cases |volume=28 |work=Bibliologia |author=Nicolangelo Scianna |publisher=Brepols |year=2010 |isbn=9782503533438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and training ==
In France, conservators specialized in graphic arts and books are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.

The '''CFDICT''' project was started by David Houstin in 2010 and is maintained by a team on [[Chine Informations]], with the aim to provide a complete [[Chinese language|Chinese]] to [[French language|French]] dictionary with pronunciation in [[pinyin]] for the Chinese characters.

== Content ==

CFDICT is a [[text file]]; other programs (or simply [[Microsoft Notepad|Notepad]] or [[egrep]] or equivalent) are needed to search and display it. This project is considered a standard Chinese-French reference on the Internet and is used by several other Chinese-French projects.  The [[Pleco Software]] uses CFDICT data for its Chinese-French Dictionary&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pleco.com/products/pleco-for-android/ PLECO for Android]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Features:
* [[Traditional Chinese]] and [[Simplified Chinese]]
* Pinyin
* French
* {{As of|2017|10|15}}, it had 50,580 entries &lt;ref&gt;[https://chine.in/mandarin/dictionnaire/CFDICT/]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[UTF-8]].

The basic format of the CFDICT.xml file is:
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;

[[File:Causeway Bay Bookstore.jpg|thumb|250px|The entrance of Causeway Bay Books. It has been closed since the disappearance of its fifth staff member, Lee Bo.]]

The '''Causeway Bay Books disappearances''' are a series of international disappearances concerning five staff members of [[Causeway Bay Books]], located in [[Causeway Bay]], [[Hong Kong]]. Between October and December 2015, five staff of Causeway Bay Books went missing. At least two of them disappeared in [[mainland China]], one in [[Thailand]]. One member was last seen in Hong Kong, and eventually revealed to be in [[Shenzhen]], across the Chinese border, without the travel documents necessary to have crossed the border through legal channels.

It was widely believed that the booksellers were detained in mainland China,&lt;ref name=20160107guardianpull/&gt;&lt;ref name=time4172407/&gt; and in February 2016 [[Guangdong]] provincial authorities confirmed that all five had been taken into custody in relation to an old traffic case involving [[Gui Minhai]].&lt;ref name=time4208964/&gt; While response to the October disappearances had been muted, perhaps in recognition that unexplained disappearances and lengthy [[extrajudicial detention]]s are known to occur in mainland China,&lt;ref name=bigstory1/&gt; the unprecedented disappearance of a person in Hong Kong, and the bizarre events surrounding it, shocked the city and crystallised international concern over the possible abduction of Hong Kong citizens by [[Chinese public security bureau]] officials and their likely [[extraordinary rendition|rendition]], and the violation of several articles of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]]. In his report to the British government and parliament in early January 2016, foreign secretary [[Philip Hammond]] said the incident was "a serious breach of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] on Hong Kong and undermines the principle of [[one country, two systems]]".&lt;ref name=20160212theguardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc35557226/&gt;

Following the international focus on the disappearances, there were virtual reappearances by two of the missing men, Lee Bo, in the form of letters and photographs, and Gui Minhai, in a confessional video broadcast on national television, in which they insisted that their return to [[mainland China]] was voluntary but which failed to account for their movement across national borders. These efforts were widely derided by commentators as a farce and a charade, as they failed to satisfy concerns over the breach of "one country, two systems" and its practical and constitutional implications.&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160129/&gt;&lt;ref name=20160111vohk/&gt;

On 16 June 2016, shortly after he returned to Hong Kong, [[Lam Wing-kee]] gave a long press conference in the presence of legislator [[Albert Ho]] in which he detailed the circumstances surrounding his eight-month detention, and describing how his confession and those of his associates had been scripted and stage-managed. Lam indicated the involvement of the [[Central Investigation Team]], which is under direct control of the highest level of the Beijing leadership. His revelations stunned Hong Kong and made headlines worldwide, prompting a scurry of counter-accusations and denials from mainland authorities and supporters.&lt;ref name="AutoRQ-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=20160616hongkongfp/&gt;

==Background==
Causeway Bay Books (銅鑼灣書店), located in [[Causeway Bay]], Hong Kong, was founded in 1994 by Lam Wing-kee.&lt;ref name=nextmedia54595242/&gt; It is one of about 110 independent Hong Kong bookshops that rent out space in upstairs locations to avoid high rents at street level.&lt;ref name=20160108hongkongfp/&gt; The bookstore sells a number of political books that are considered sensitive and banned in mainland China. [[Freedom of speech]] in Hong Kong is protected under [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]] Article 27, and these independent publishers thrive as they cater predominantly to people interested in the machinations of mainland politics.&lt;ref name=time4172407/&gt;&lt;ref name=nextmedia54595242/&gt;&lt;ref name=20160108hongkongfp/&gt; The bookstore has become popular amongst mainland Chinese tourists for this reason.&lt;ref name=nextmedia54595242/&gt;&lt;ref name=20160108hongkongfp/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc34782266/&gt; In 2014, the bookstore was sold to Mighty Current Media Company Limited (巨流傳媒有限公司), a publishing house. During the time of the disappearances, the company had three shareholders: Gui Minhai, Sophie Choi and Lui Bo.{{r|Initium}} According to industry sources, Mighty Current is a prolific publisher with a number of publishing subsidiaries, and this group may be responsible for 30 to 60 percent of the output of salacious books about Chinese political figures that are widely available at newsstands and in book stores, including one at Hong Kong International Airport.&lt;ref name=20160105nytimes/&gt;

Around the time of the disappearances, Gui Minhai was rumoured to have been working on a book regarding current CPC general secretary [[Xi Jinping]]'s personal history, tentatively named ''Xi and His Six Women'' (習近平和他的六個女人). The project was suggested to be linked to the disappearances.&lt;ref name=20160107guardianpull/&gt;&lt;ref name=20160105theguardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=20160120nytimes/&gt; The publishing house had also already gone to press with a book entitled ''2017: Upheaval in China'', but it was withdrawn by the author before publication.&lt;ref name=20160120nytimes/&gt;

In late 2013, Yiu Man-tin (姚文田), founder and chief editor of Morning Bell Press (晨鐘書局) and a Hong Kong resident, was arrested in Shenzhen after he had been tricked there.&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160104/&gt;&lt;ref name=20140129nytimes/&gt;{{r|Initium}} He was known to have been preparing to publish book by a Chinese writer residing in the US about Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping, entitled ''Godfather of China, Xi Jinping'' (中國教父習近平).&lt;ref name=20140129nytimes/&gt; Yiu was arrested by police in Shenzhen on charges of falsely labelling and smuggling industrial chemicals worth $220,000 in 2010 and was sentenced to prison for 10 years allegedly for smuggling, even though the real reason for the trumped up charges, in the eyes of many, was China's increasing restrictions on political expression under Xi.&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160104/&gt;&lt;ref name=20140129nytimes/&gt; Two Hong Kong magazine publishers, Wong Kin-man and Wo Chung-hau, were arrested and tried in November 2015 for running an illegal business in China after sending copies of a political magazine to people on the mainland.{{r|Initium}}&lt;ref name=20151109guardian/&gt;

Chinese [[PEN International|PEN Center]] director [[Bei Ling]] alerted ''Apple Daily'' to Lee Bo's disappearance, and the journal reported on 1 January 2016 that Lee had become the fifth member of Causeway Bay Books to disappear. His wife was unwilling to speak to the press at the time, but filed a missing person's report with the Hong Kong police the following day.&lt;ref name=20160105ejinsightunanswered/&gt;&lt;ref name=nextmedia54599826/&gt;

=== Guangdong Action Plan ===
According to  ''The Sunday Times'', the mainland authorities had issued instructions on 25 April 2015 to eradicate illegal publications and those containing sexual content. ''The Sunday Times'' published what was described to be an alleged internal Communist Party document entitled "Guangdong Action Plan", a summary of which had been circulating in journalistic and political circles the previous week, and the full document gives apparent authorisation for excursions by Guangdong enforcers targeting authors, publishers and booksellers. In it, 14 publishing houses and 21 publications in Hong Kong were named.&lt;ref name=thesundaytimes1659622 /&gt;&lt;ref name=mingjingnews32000001467 /&gt;

==Disappearances==
'''Lui Bo''' (呂波, age 45) is the manager and one of the three shareholders of Mighty Current. His last known location was the bookstore. On 14 October 2015, he logged in for the last time onto the bookstore computer. Unconfirmed sources state that he was taken away from his wife's home in [[Shenzhen]].{{r|Initium}}

'''[[Gui Minhai]]''' (桂民海, age 51) is a Swedish national and one of the three shareholders of Mighty Current.{{r|Initium}} He was taken away from his home in [[Pattaya]], Thailand by an unknown man on 17 October 2015.{{r|Gui1|Gui2}} Gui had written some 200 books during his ten years as author/publisher. He kept his movements to himself and his communications routed, and his work projects would also be shrouded in secrecy.{{R|20151208guardian}} Gui has not set foot inside the PRC for a long period – he never attended to his father when he was ill, and did not return upon his death.{{R|nextmedia19458046}} It is known that his home in Thailand was later searched by four Chinese men, who attempted to seize Gui's computer.{{r|Gui1|Gui2|time4184324}} A manager from the estate where Gui lived, in an effort to contact Gui, dialled the number that last called her regarding Gui, to be told by a taxi driver that the four men, who had left the telephone in the taxi, wanted to go to a border town in Cambodia.{{R|20151208guardian}} He was last heard from on 6 November when he called his wife to tell her that he was safe but was unwilling to reveal his whereabouts.{{r|Sweden2}} Gui's family contacted the Swedish embassy, and the Swedish police filed a report through Interpol, but ''the Guardian'', noting that the military junta was becoming increasingly accommodating to Chinese demands, observed that the Thais had done little to advance the case.{{R|20151208guardian}} The Thai authorities have no record of him leaving the country.{{R|scmp1902800}}

'''[[Lam Wing-kee]]''' (林榮基, age 60), the founder of Causeway Bay Books, has been missing since 24 October 2015.{{r|Lam2}} He habitually spent long hours at the bookshop and occasionally slept there.{{R|mingpao1452017341}} His wife filed a missing persons report with the police on 5 November and his family received a telephone call from him several hours later;{{R|mingpao1452017341}} he refused to reveal his whereabouts.{{r|Lam1}} When filing the police report, they were referred to the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]], who said it was against privacy policy to reveal a person's records of entry and exit of Hong Kong without the subject's permission.{{r|Lam2|mingpao1452017341}} However, legislator [[James To]] said this was a reasonable request that was exempt from privacy policy.{{R|mingpao1452017341}} Police followed up on his case once, asking whether they had heard from him. His family allege that upon learning that he had contacted his family, the officer who called them informed that the case would be closed as resolved.{{r|mingpao1452010640}}

'''Cheung Jiping''' (張志平, age 32), a manager of Mighty Current, was taken away from his wife's home in [[Fenggang, Dongguan]] by at least a dozen men in plainclothes.{{r|Initium}}

'''Lee Bo''' (aka '''Paul Lee''', 李波, age 65),{{R|bbc35233791}} was a British citizen and the husband of Sophie Choi, who is in turn one of the three shareholders of Mighty Current.{{r|Initium}} Lee regularly helped out in the bookstore. Lee Bo's wife has written a column for 20 years under the pen name of Syu Fei at ''[[Ta Kung Pao]]'' – owned by the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR|Liaison Office]]; Lee worked at [[Joint Publishing]] until he started work at the bookstore.{{R|20160111hongkongfpcolumn}} Since the disappearances of four of his colleagues, he had been doing anonymous interviews with [[BBC]] and various media. After the arrest of Yiu Man-tin and the disappearance of three of his colleagues, Lee went on record to say that their motive was purely economic, and that not setting foot in the mainland was the cost to bear for being in the publishing business.{{R|nextmedia329472}} Lee was last seen on 30 December 2015, while delivering books in [[Chai Wan]] to a certain unknown client.{{r|Lee1}} Choi, who had been expecting Lee home for dinner at around 7.15&amp;nbsp;pm on 30 December, raised the alarm when he failed to return home.{{R|nextmedia54599826|20160103hongkongfp|bbc35219260}} Lee had apparently received an order for about ten books from a new customer and had arranged to hand them over in person that night.{{R|nextmedia54599826}} He descended his building in a lift with at least eight other people at around 6&amp;nbsp;pm, and witnesses saw him being pushed by a group of men into a minivan, which sped away the moment he was securely on board.{{R|mingpao1452534776}} Choi, Lee Bo's wife, later received a telephone call from him from a Shenzhen number.{{R|nextmedia54599826|bbc35219260}} Uncharacteristically speaking in [[Mandarin Chinese]] and apparently with someone whispering over his shoulder,{{R|nextmedia54599826}} Lee said that he had to go to the mainland on urgent business and that he would not be back home for some time. He assured her that he was well but assisting with investigations. His wife was told to be discreet.{{r|20160105ejinsightunanswered|nextmedia54599826}} The Immigration Department has no record of Lee having left Hong Kong,{{R|ejinsight20160104}} and Hong Kong does not have any extradition agreement with the PRC.{{R|20160105nytimes}} The fact that his [[Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents|home return permit]] was left at home led many to fear that he may have somehow been abducted by the mainland [[Chinese public security bureau|public security bureau]] and [[Extraordinary rendition|rendition]]ed to [[Shenzhen]]. His disappearance is the only known disappearance that occurred in Hong Kong territory, and thus sparked even more concern on whether the integrity of "one country, two systems" is being maintained.{{R|bbc35219260|mingpao1451585098799|metrohk299289|nextmedia19436390|Ming1451757876466}}

==Reactions to Lee Bo's disappearance==
=== Local ===
[[File:Kidnap by Kacey Wong.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Kacey Wong]] at the protest against booksellers' disappearances on 10 January with red noose bearing the Chinese characters for "abduction" as props]]
Amongst local media outlets, only ''Apple Daily'' and ''Ming Pao'' ran coverage on their front pages initially, while other local newspapers carried only brief pieces about a missing person. Television viewers remarked that [[TVB]] did not run the story during its prime time news programmes for the first few days after news of the Lee Bo disappearance broke.&lt;ref name="20160104ejinsight-howsafe"/&gt; Lee Bo's disappearance spurred renewed interest about Lam Wing-kee, and his family received a police visit the same day after chief executive CY Leung spoke publicly on the case.&lt;ref name=mingpao1452017341/&gt;

Hong Kong's Chief Secretary [[Carrie Lam (politician)|Carrie Lam]] said that the Hong Kong government cares about the wellbeing of its people, and assured the public that police were working on the case.&lt;ref name=20160103hongkongfp/&gt; [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[CY Leung]] stated in a press conference on 4 January 2016 that if mainland Chinese law officials were operating in Hong Kong, it would be "unacceptable" and a breach of the [[Basic Law]].{{r|CY1}}&lt;ref name="20160105nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="20160107guardianpull" /&gt;&lt;ref name="20160105ejinsightunanswered" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ejinsight20160111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo054725278" /&gt; Article 22 states that no department of the central, provincial, or municipal governments within China may interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region administers on its own.&lt;ref name=basiclaw/&gt; Leung furthermore hoped that "anyone, especially Lee Bo himself, can provide relevant information" about his disappearance.&lt;ref name=mingpao1452017341/&gt;&lt;ref name=20160105hkfp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160109/&gt; In January 2016, after it was revealed that all five men were in mainland China, Lam expressed confidence in the sincerity and goodwill of the PRC government, and said that Lee Bo's disappearance was an isolated case that needed a swift resolution, but it did not amount to a breakdown of one country two systems.&lt;ref name=standnews/&gt; The American Chamber of Commerce asserted that with the rule of law, Hong Kong was still a preferable springboard to invest from, compared with Shanghai or Beijing, but nevertheless expressed concern at the disappearances.&lt;ref name=rthk1237613/&gt;

Leading pro-establishment figures cast doubt on the mainland's supposed role in the disappearances:&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160111/&gt; [[Ip Kwok-him]] said that it was possible to use mainland telephone lines in Hong Kong, so the phone call from a Shenzhen number did not necessarily mean Lee was in the mainland; he added that there was no evidence of abduction. After Lee's wife cancelled her police report, [[Yiu Si-wing]] disputed the need for LegCo to discuss his disappearance due to the cancellation; [[Michael Tien]] said that if Lee had voluntarily gone to the mainland, it could not be a question of mainland officials acting across the border; [[Wong Kwok-kin]] said that kidnappers demand ransoms and not cancellation of missing persons reports.&lt;ref name=nextmedia19445201/&gt; [[Regina Ip]] said it was odd that Lee would be able to apparently telephone his wife freely if he was in custody, unlike if he was detained in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=hkej1215102/&gt; [[Ng Leung-sing]], during a [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]] discussion, claimed to have received a tip from "an old friend" that all five booksellers had taken clandestine speedboats to Wai Lingding Island ([[:zh:外伶仃島|外伶仃島]]), an island south of Hong Kong that is administratively part of mainland China with no border facilities, and had been arrested for seeking prostitutes.{{r|Ng1}} The allegations of prostitution, criticised by pro-democracy figures as [[character assassination]], were carried by TVB on its prime time evening news as the leading item.&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160107a/&gt; Ng later apologised under pressure, saying that he had repeated a rumour without having checked the facts but never mentioned Lee's name.&lt;ref name=20160105nytimes/&gt;{{r|Ng2}} Ng said he was merely trying to state that it was indeed possible to leave Hong Kong without identity documents, and that it was inappropriate to speculate at present. Lee's wife criticised Ng for his insincere apology.&lt;ref name=metrohk299590/&gt;

[[Martin Lee]] said that "according to all the evidence that has been reported, I believe that Mr. Lee had been taken against his will by certain law enforcement agents from across the border through illegal means". He described the disappearances as the "most worrying thing that has happened in Hong Kong since the handover in 1997".&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160111prominent/&gt; [[Benny Tai]] and former chief secretary [[Anson Chan]] both said the case poses a genuine threat to the "one country, two systems" principle, which China ought to uphold. Former legislator [[Margaret Ng]] suggested that Hong Kong's status as a world city was coming into question, and said "Hong Kong can be deemed to be no longer safe unless we have a clear resolution of the problem".&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160111prominent/&gt; [[Albert Chan]] said "this is the first time there has been such a clear violation of Hong Kong's law, a clear violation of 'one country, two systems' principle, that has taken place in such an open manner", and [[Lee Cheuk-yan]], called the disappearances a "milestone for suppression".&lt;ref name=bbc35275309/&gt; [[Joseph Wong]], former secretary for the Hong Kong civil service, also said that the incident will have drastic consequences as foreign confidence in the one country two systems policy may be irreparably damaged, which may in turn jeopardise Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160113/&gt;

On 10 January, in excess of 6,000 people attended a protest march from the Hong Kong government headquarters in Admiralty to the China Liaison Office in Sai Wan demanding Beijing to respect the one country, two systems agreement to preserve Hong Kong's autonomy.&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160111/&gt;&lt;ref name=20160110hongkongfprally/&gt; ''Ta Kung Pao'' announced on the same day that Sophie Choi's regular "Syu Fei" column with the paper was temporarily suspended – a spokesman for the journal said that Choi had advised them just before the new year that she was unable to submit any copy in January.&lt;ref name=20160111hongkongfpcolumn/&gt; The Hong Kong police said that Lee Bo and his wife had met at a guesthouse in China on Saturday, 23 January. Choi acknowledged he was well and that he was "assisting in an investigation in the capacity of a witness".&lt;ref name=yahoo054725278/&gt;&lt;ref name=rthk1237844/&gt;&lt;ref name=20160124newsweek/&gt; After the latest revelation, legislator [[Fernando Cheung]] criticised the CY Leung administration for limpness, remarking that "up to now the whole handling of the Lee Bo fiasco is being conducted through unofficial means, bypassing the Hong Kong authorities, and Lee Bo seems to be releasing messages under the gun".&lt;ref name=20160124theguardian/&gt;

=== Authors and other publishers ===
The disappearances led to a very severe crisis of confidence within the publishing sector, with many booksellers being afraid to sell such books on mainland politics or featuring gossip on political figures.&lt;ref name=20160114guardian/&gt; As of 7 January 2016, over 500 publishers, writers, booksellers and members of the public had signed an online petition pledging to "not fear the white terror and uphold the principle of publication freedom". Some booksellers began to pull anti-China books off shelves.&lt;ref name=reutersspooked/&gt; Singapore-owned [[Page One (bookstore)|Page One]] removed some of the books published by Mighty Current – in particular many titles focusing on Xi Jinping – from their retail outlet at [[Hong Kong airport]].&lt;ref name=20160107guardianpull/&gt;&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160106pageone/&gt; The head of Open Publishing decided to abort the publication of ''Xi Jinping's Nightmare'', which had already come back from the printers.&lt;ref name=latimes20160120/&gt; The author was unable to find a publisher in Hong Kong, and has gone to Taiwan.&lt;ref name=20160114guardian/&gt; Richard Charkin, president of the International Publishers Association expressed "deep concern" for the missing men and called for their safe return home. He added that the disappearances "immediately raise dire questions about the Chinese government's commitment to freedom to publish".&lt;ref name=20160114guardian/&gt;

On the other hand, US-based writer Xi Nuo ({{zh|西諾|labels=no}}) released his book ''Xi Jinping and His Lovers'' that was turned down by Gui Minhai the previous year after he had received a visit from a Chinese government agent. Xi Nuo says his decision to publish the book was to challenge the Chinese authorities. "I want to tell the Chinese authorities and Xi Jinping, the president of China, that you are wrong. Completely wrong. You better release the five guys. Let them go back home".&lt;ref name=bbc35480229/&gt; American and European associations of publishers and booksellers – including [[PEN American Center]], the [[Authors Guild]] and the [[Federation of European Publishers]] – jointly wrote to CY Leung, urging him to take action on the missing Causeway Bay booksellers and "request a formal assurance from Beijing that it will respect Hong Kong's autonomy and abide by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration".&lt;ref name=20160218hongkongfp/&gt;

===National===
[[Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Foreign Minister]] stated that despite Lee Bo's dual Hong Kong and British citizenship, Lee is above all a Chinese citizen.{{r|BBC3}} This is viewed as a rebuke to Britain and a characterisation of the disappearance as an internal matter.&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160106/&gt; Wang claimed that there was no evidence that the missing persons were taken by the Chinese government, and urged for an end to "useless speculations." {{r|BBC3}} China's Foreign Ministry maintains that China opposes "any foreign country interfering with China's domestic politics or interfering with Hong Kong affairs".&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160107a/&gt;

''[[Global Times]]'', a tabloid subsidiary of ''[[People's Daily]]'', wrote three successive belligerent editorials on the case,&lt;ref name=nextmedia19445201/&gt; an act viewed by Hong Kong media as an indirect recognition of China's role in the disappearances.&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160109/&gt;&lt;ref name=nextmedia19445201/&gt;&lt;ref name=ltn1563388/&gt; The first editorial, on 4 January, opined that the bookshop's business model depended on "stirring up troubles on the mainland ... [and]... that it interferes with mainland affairs in a disguised way, and damages the mainland's vital interests to maintain its harmony and stability."&lt;ref name=20160105nytimes/&gt; On 6 January 2016, they published another editorial stating that Causeway Bay Books being under investigation by Chinese officials for slander is "reasonable", and also noted that "all powerful agencies in the world have ways to evade the law, so that those under investigation will cooperate".&lt;ref name=nextmedia19445201/&gt;&lt;ref name=huanqiu/&gt;

Mainland law enforcement agencies must notify their Hong Kong counterparts within 14 days under a reciprocal mechanism if any Hong Kong resident is detained across the border, but Hong Kong officials had received no word through these channels at the expiration of the deadline.&lt;ref name=20160118hongkongfp/&gt; On 8 January Chinese security officials acknowledged that Lee Bo was being held in China.&lt;ref name=201601asiancorrespondent/&gt;&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160119/&gt; This took the form of a nine-word message sent to the Hong Kong Police Force with no indication of his whereabouts or his activity status.&lt;ref name=latimes20160120/&gt;

===Interested third countries===
Speaking anonymously, a senior foreign diplomat in Hong Kong revealed that at least six countries had expressed their concern and asked for information regarding the disappearances as at 23 January 2016.&lt;ref name=20160124newsweek/&gt; Reuters revealed that fifteen ambassadors or consuls were concerned about the broad interpretation of Chinese nationality, and that the denial of consular access to a Swedish and a British passport holder was a violation of international treaties. Eight countries including the US, UK, Sweden, Canada, Japan, Australia and Germany had privately expressed concerns about the apparent breach of "One country, two systems".&lt;ref name=nextmedia54732705/&gt;
* {{flagu|United Kingdom}}: As Lee Bo is a [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizen]] of both the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] expressed "deep concerns" over the disappearances.{{r|BBC2}} On 5 January 2016, Foreign Minister [[Philip Hammond]], in a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, urged China and Hong Kong to locate the missing persons.{{r|BBC3}} Hammond said it was important to "know what has happened and who is responsible for it", and that it would be an "egregious breach of the one country, two systems policy, Hong Kong's Basic Law and the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration for someone to be spirited out of Hong Kong in order to face charges in a different jurisdiction".&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160107b/&gt; About 50 people protested in front of the Chinese embassy in London on 10 January 2016.&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160111/&gt;&lt;ref name=20160110hongkongfplondon/&gt; In his report on Hong Kong for the second half of 2015, British Foreign Secretary again expressed concern about Lee Bo's case, and called for Lee's immediate return to Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=20160212theguardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc35557226 /&gt;&lt;ref name=20160211govuk /&gt;
* {{flagu|Sweden}}: As Gui Minhai is a Swedish national, on 5 January 2016, the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] stated that they took a "serious view" on Gui's disappearance.{{r|Sweden1}}
* {{flagu|Republic of China}}: On 5 January 2016, chairman of [[Kuomintang]] and [[Taiwanese general election, 2016|2016 presidential candidate]] [[Eric Chu]] urged the Hong Kong and Chinese government to give clear answers on the incident. Likewise, on 6 January, fellow presidential candidate and [[Democratic Progressive Party]] leader [[Tsai Ing-wen]] called for answers and the protection of the freedom of speech in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=nextmedia19442087/&gt;
* {{flagu|European Union}}: On 7 January 2016, the European Union [[European External Action Service]] issued a statement calling the incident to be "extremely worrying," and urged the governments of China, Hong Kong and Thailand to investigate the disappearances.&lt;ref name=time4172407/&gt;&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; On 4 February, the European Parliament, while expressing their concern over the missing men, passed a motion calling for the immediate safe release of the booksellers and "all other persons arbitrarily arrested for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and publication in Hong Kong". The parliament also urged the Chinese government "to stop suppressing the free flow of information, including by restricting the use of the internet".&lt;ref name=20160205hongkongfp/&gt;
* {{flagu|United States}}: On 8 January 2016, [[US State Department]] spokesman [[John Kirby (admiral)|John Kirby]] said in a regular news briefing that the US government is "disturbed" by the disappearances and "[shares] the concern of the people of Hong Kong regarding these disappearances."&lt;ref name=USA/&gt;

=== Commentators ===
Commentators have noted a resurgent interest from citizens in renewing their [[BNO passport]]s as they are feeling insecure in having a Hong Kong passport.&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160113/&gt;&lt;ref name=sina5294389/&gt;&lt;ref name=rfi/&gt; Legal experts have become increasingly concerned at the reach of Chinese law enforcement. [[Jerome A. Cohen]], expert in Chinese law at [[New York University]], said China's increasing assertiveness in the world represents "not only the extending reach of Chinese law, but the extending reach of Chinese lawlessness."&lt;ref name=20160108nytimes/&gt; Willy Lam, professor at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], warned: "Not just the publishing and media circles, but the entire Hong Kong society, including people who do business in [mainland] China, and who might have commercial disputes with Chinese companies or different parts of the Chinese government, might fear for their safety because of such a very dangerous precedent".&lt;ref name=rthk1233405/&gt; "Freedom from fear is a thing of the past for Hong Kong and this applies to everyone: businessmen or student," said a spokesman for the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor.&lt;ref name=20160210theguardian/&gt;

Although alternative options to doing business with China are few for the business sector, many companies large and small, including within the important financial sector, are uneasy about the changing political climate. The head of the one business association in Hong Kong said: "The middle-class, the professionals, even the accountants: people are just freaked out about what is going on... The last bastion of Hong Kong's guarantees is the law. What we have left is our legal system, but people fear that this may be under attack too". Steve Vickers, the principal of one local risk assessment firm said: "The Hong Kong government appears to now have considerably diminished autonomy and the liaison office seems to be strengthening its position, [the disappearances have] certainly sent a chill through the business and social arenas in Hong Kong".&lt;ref name=20160210theguardian/&gt;

== Reappearances ==
=== Gui Minhai ===
Chinese state media published an interview on 17 January where Gui Minhai confessed to causing the death of a student whilst driving under the influence of alcohol in 2005 and for which he supposedly received a two-year suspended sentence.&lt;ref name=20160118hongkongfp /&gt;&lt;ref name=now165502 /&gt;&lt;ref name=xinhuanet1117800737 /&gt;&lt;ref name=time4183967 /&gt; He allegedly absconded before the damages could be settled. According to interviews with China Central Television and [[Xinhua News Agency]], Gui said that he had been consumed with guilt and had returned to China in October to face the consequences of his misdeed.&lt;ref name=20160118hongkongfp /&gt;&lt;ref name=now165502 /&gt;&lt;ref name=xinhuanet1117800737 /&gt;

In the video footage Gui said: "Returning to the Chinese mainland and surrendering was my personal choice and had nothing to do with anyone else. I should shoulder my responsibility and I don't want any individual or institutions to interfere, or viciously hype up my return".&lt;ref name=20160117hongkongfp /&gt; Gui appealed for the public not to hype his disappearance.&lt;ref name=20160118hongkongfpunconvincing /&gt;

The confession has been received with incredulity, and many of the facts surrounding his mysterious disappearance from Thailand, including the release of the video three months after him vanishing, have been called into question.&lt;ref name=20160117hongkongfp /&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp1902805 /&gt; The president of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, [[Jasper Tsang]], said: "the China Central Television (CCTV) report [and broadcast of Gui Minghai's confession] did not seem to be able to calm the public. As the case drags on, there will be more speculation".&lt;ref name=yahoo084600596 /&gt; Human Rights Watch was quoted in the ''Wall Street Journal'' saying: "Given that Gui has been held nearly three months incommunicado, in a secret location, and without a lawyer, his confession on state-controlled TV lacks credibility."&lt;ref name=201601asiancorrespondent /&gt; ''The Washington Post'' said: "The narrative seems messy and incoherent, blending possible fact with what seems like outright fiction. It feels illogical, absurd even. But that may be the point. Televised confessions don't tend to trade in logic, or truth. They trade in fear."&lt;ref name=20160118wapo /&gt;&lt;ref name=qz596565 /&gt; Following China Central Television's release of videotaped confessions from Gui Minhai – and of Swedish NGO staffer Peter Dahlin, [[Reporters Without Borders]] condemned China's "dissemination of forced 'confessions' that have no informational value". The organisation urged the EU to sanction CCTV and Xinhua for "knowingly peddling lies and statements presumably obtained under duress".&lt;ref name=yahoo082607414 /&gt; Hong Kong's chief executive said that he was unable to act as "the Gui Minhai case has not been reported to the Hong Kong police or the government".&lt;ref name=20151208guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=time4183967 /&gt;

The Swedish foreign ministry said an envoy had visited Gui in February,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; but Swedish diplomats had not been given access to him since.&lt;ref name="scmp1966843"/&gt;

On October 2017, he was formally released and ended up living in the eastern city of Ningbo, under heavy police presence and surveillance. In January 2018, Gui was travelling to Beijing for a medical exam at the Swedish embassy, accompanying him was two Swedish diplomats from the Swedish Consulate in Shanghai. Before reaching Beijing, 10 men in plain clothes kidnapped him away yet again in front of the diplomats. Chinese officials said that he was seized for allegedly  sharing secret information with Swedish diplomats and of meeting them illegally. This incident caused Sweden to summon its Chinese ambassador to explain.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/world/asia/china-police-bookseller-train-gui-minhai.html?smid=tw-share&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/01/23/sweden-summons-china-ambassador-bookseller-gui-minhai-reportedly-seized-train-front-diplomats/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lee Bo ===
After his wife reported his disappearance to the Hong Kong police, a letter purportedly handwritten by Lee Bo was faxed to Taiwan's [[Central News Agency (Taiwan)|Central News Agency]] on 4 January 2016, explaining that he had "returned to the mainland using my own methods" to work with "concerned parties".&lt;ref name="bbc letter" /&gt; Saying that she believed the letter was written voluntarily, Lee Bo's wife withdrew her request for police help.&lt;ref name="bbc letter" /&gt;&lt;ref name=abc7069766 /&gt; However, the case remains open as Hong Kong police confirmed that a missing person report can only be cancelled by the subject in person.&lt;ref name=20160108hongkongfp /&gt;

On 10 January, ''[[Headline Daily]]'' claimed to have obtained an exclusive video in which Lee Bo claimed that he was safe and that his disappearance was merely a personal trip.&lt;ref name=scmp1899705 /&gt;&lt;ref name=20160110hongkongfprally /&gt;&lt;ref name=headline1042590 /&gt; It also published a letter, purporting to say that he was "perplexed and puzzled" about the reaction over the disappearances. He also condemned a protest that was to be held on the same day.&lt;ref name=ejinsight20160111 /&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp1899705 /&gt;

Another letter allegedly written by Lee Bo to his wife was sent to ''[[Sing Tao Daily]]'' on 17 January, the day Gui Minhai's confession was aired, in which Lee denounced his colleague's reprehensible lack of morals in connection with his car accident, and blamed Gui for the fate that had befallen him.&lt;ref name=now165502 /&gt; In it, Lee also said that he had become good friends with his captors.&lt;ref name=nextmedia54660226 /&gt;

On 29 February, Lee Bo met with Hong Kong police and then gave a televised interview on the Hong Kong-based [[Phoenix Television]] in an undisclosed location in mainland China, in what was his first public appearance since he went missing. He held to the story that was in the letters published by ''Sing Tao'', saying he "resorted to illegal immigration" to get to the mainland "to cooperate in a judicial investigation" as he did not want to draw attention to his visit. He denied that he was kidnapped, but did not give details as to how he actually entered Mainland China without his travel documents. Adding that his British citizenship had been sensationalised, Lee Bo says that he will abandon his [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="AutoV4-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoV4-2"/&gt;

On 24 March Lee Bo returned to Hong Kong and asked the authorities to drop the case like his three colleagues did before. He said he would never again sell banned books, and was transported back into the mainland in a vehicle with cross-border licence plates the next day.&lt;ref name="scmp1930052"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scmp1930513"/&gt;

=== Lui Bo and Cheung Jiping ===
On 4 February 2016, provincial authorities in [[Guangdong]] confirmed that Lui Bo, Cheung Jiping, and Lam Wing-kee had been taken into custody in relation to a case involving Gui Minhai.&lt;ref name=time4208964 /&gt;&lt;ref name=infoP201602041116 /&gt; The Guangdong authorities accused them of being "involved in illegal activities on the mainland" saying that "criminal compulsory measures were imposed on them".&lt;ref name=ibtimes2295403 /&gt; On 28 February, the three men appeared on Phoenix Television along with Gui Minhai in which they confessed to conspiring with Gui to send banned books to mainland customers and expressed remorse for their "illegal book trading"; Lam, further claiming Gui's books were fabrication, having been compiled from information obtained from the internet and magazines, acknowledged that the books "generated lots of rumours in society and brought a bad influence".&lt;ref name=20160229guardian/&gt; Phoenix TV, citing police sources, said the three men showed "good attitude" by confessing and might be allowed to return to Hong Kong within the week while they await trial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the Hong Kong government, Lui Bo had returned to Hong Kong and met with Hong Kong police on the morning of 4 March. He requested that his missing person case be closed and expressed that he does not require assistance from the Hong Kong government and police.&lt;ref name="AutoV4-3"/&gt; Cheung Jiping also came back to Hong Kong two days later, and also asked the Hong Kong police to drop his missing person case. It appears that both men returned to mainland China hours after meeting with the Hong Kong authorities.&lt;ref name="scmp1922757"/&gt;

===Lam Wing-kee===
Lam Wing-kee was the last bookseller with Hong Kong citizenship to be allowed to return to Hong Kong from the mainland, eight months after he disappeared. On 13 June, Lam cancelled his missing person's report with the police, repudiating police assistance.&lt;ref name="scmp1975048"/&gt; Three days later, on the day he was due to return to the mainland, he held a press briefing in the presence of legislator [[Albert Ho]] during which he claimed that he was abducted by the mainland officials at the Hong Kong-China border control in [[Shenzhen]] on 24 October 2015.&lt;ref name="Lam"/&gt; He revealed that he had been transported handcuffed and blindfolded to [[Ningbo]].&lt;ref name="Lam"/&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp1976598/&gt; Lam was not told what offence he had committed until after he was taken to Ningbo, where he was held in solitary confinement and under 24-hour guard by six teams of gaolers from the "Central Investigation Team" ({{zh|中央專案組|labels=no}}) – a [[Cultural Revolution]]-era unit whose powers and authority exceed those of the [[Chinese public security bureau|public security bureau]]s (PSB), reporting to central leadership.&lt;ref name="AutoRQ-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRQ-3"/&gt; Lam felt he had no choice and signed away his rights of access to a lawyer and to inform family members of his detention.&lt;ref name=hk01-26430/&gt;&lt;ref name="scmp1976598"/&gt; During his detention, he was subject to frequent interrogations each lasting around 40 minutes during which he was repeatedly accused of illegally sending banned books to mainland China.&lt;ref name="AutoRQ-4"/&gt;

After March 2016, Lam was transferred to [[Shaoguan]], where he worked in a library, but was prevented from leaving the mainland.&lt;ref name="hk01-26430"/&gt;&lt;ref name="20160616hongkongfp"/&gt; His release was conditional upon retrieving a hard drive from the bookstore containing lists of readers who had bought books from his business and without divulging any details of his detention.&lt;ref name="Lam"/&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp1976598/&gt; He also stated that his confession on mainland TV in February was scripted, and that Lee Bo, who told him he was "taken away from Hong Kong", had also been forced to make a televised confession.&lt;ref name="Lam"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hk01-26430/&gt;

Lee Bo rejected Lam's assertions the next day, denying that he had told Lam how he ended up in the mainland or that he had handed over the bookstore's list of customers to mainland police. He also claimed that he was assisting Ningbo's PSB during his time there, and had never heard of the Central Investigation Team.&lt;ref name="scmp1976820"/&gt; ''Sing Tao Daily'' published a retort by a case officer in Ningbo, saying that Lam and his girlfriend had signed confessions to having been engaged in "illegal business operations" and agreements not to hire lawyers nor see their families. The officer said Lam was on bail, and was allowed to return to Hong Kong to attend to personal matters.&lt;ref name="scmp1976912"/&gt;

The Chinese foreign ministry said: "Lam Wing-kee is a Chinese citizen, and he has violated China's laws on the mainland... Relevant authorities in China are authorised to handle the case in accordance with the law."&lt;ref name="AutoRQ-5"/&gt;

[[Quality management system]]s involving laboratory accreditation under national and international accreditation/certification [[international standard|standard]]s such as [[ISO/IEC 17025]] require [[metrological traceability]] to Certified Reference Materials (where possible) when using reference materials for [[calibration]].&lt;ref name=ilac_p10sec4&gt;

; Reference Material:  Material, sufficiently homogeneous and stable with respect to one or more specified properties, which has been established to be fit for its intended use in a measurement process.
; Certified Reference Material:  Reference material characterized by a metrologically valid procedure for one or more specified properties, accompanied by a certificate that provides the value of the specified property, its associated uncertainty, and a statement of metrological traceability.

== Types of reference material ==
[[International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation|ILAC]] describes the following five types of reference material:&lt;ref name=ILAC_G9 /&gt;
# Pure substances; essentially pure [[chemical]]s, characterised for chemical purity and/or trace impurities.
# Standard solutions and gas mixtures, often prepared gravimetrically from pure substances.
# Matrix reference materials, characterised for the composition of specified major, minor or trace chemical constituents. Such materials may be prepared from matrices containing the components of interest, or by preparing synthetic mixtures.
# Physico-chemical reference materials, characterised for properties such as melting point, viscosity, or optical density.
# Reference objects or artifacts, characterised for functional properties such as taste, odour, octane number, flash point and hardness. This type also includes microscopy specimens characterised for properties ranging from fibre type to microbiological specimens.

== Production ==

=== Principal steps in producing certified reference materials ===
The preparation of certified reference materials is described in general in ISO Guide 17034&lt;ref name=standard17034&gt;{{cite book
   |title=ISO Guide 17034:2016 - General requirements for the competence of reference material producers
 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=29357

 |publisher=International Organization for Standardization
 |location=Geneva
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in more detail in ISO Guide 35.&lt;ref name=guide35&gt;{{cite book
   |title=ISO Guide 35:2017 - Reference materials — Guidance for characterization and assessment of homogeneity and stability  |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/60281.html
 |year=2017
 |publisher=International Organization for Standardization
 |location=Geneva
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparation of biological reference standards is described in WHO Guidance.&lt;ref name="who932_annex2" /&gt; General steps required in production of a certified reference material typically include:&lt;ref name=guide35 /&gt;

* Collection or synthesis of material
* Sample preparation (including homogenization, stabilization, bottling etc.)
* Homogeneity testing
* Stability assessment
* Value assignment ("characterization" in ISO REMCO terms).&lt;ref name=guide30&gt;{{cite book
   |title=ISO Guide 30:2015 Reference materials — Selected terms and definitions
 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=46209
 |year=2015
 |publisher=International Organization for Standardization
 |location=Geneva
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition it may be important to assess the [[commutability]] of a reference material; this is especially important for biological materials.&lt;ref name=who932_annex2 /&gt;

=== Sample preparation ===
Detailed sample preparation depends on the type of material. Pure standards are most likely to be prepared by chemical synthesis and purification and characterized by determination of remaining impurities.&lt;ref name=ILAC_G9/&gt; This is often done by commercial producers. Natural matrix CRMs (often shortened to 'matrix CRMs') contain an analyte or analytes in a natural sample (for, example, lead in fish tissue). These are typically produced by homogenization of a naturally occurring material followed by measurement of each analyte. Due to the difficulty in production and value assignment, these are usually produced by national or transnational metrology institutes like [[NIST]] (USA), [[Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung|BAM]] (Germany), [[KRISS]] (Korea) and [[Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements|IRMM]] (Joint Research Centre European Commission).

For natural materials, homogenization is often critical;&lt;ref name="lpv_2001"&gt;

=== Homogeneity testing ===
Homogeneity testing for a candidate reference material typically involves replicated measurements on multiple units or subsamples of the material.

Homogeneity tests for CRMs follow planned [[experimental design]]s. Because the experiment is intended to test for (or estimate the size of) variation in value between different CRM units, the designs are chosen to allow separation of variation in results due to random measurement error and variation due to differences between units of the CRM. Among the simplest designs recommended for this purpose is a simple balanced nested design (see schematic). [[File:Balanced nested design schematic for CRM homogeneity test.png|thumb|alt=caption|Schematic of a balanced nested design for a CRM homogeneity test. Large bottles show packaged individual CRM units; small vials show subsamples prepared for measurement.]] Typically 10-30 CRM units are taken from the batch at random; [[Stratified sampling|stratified random sampling]] is recommended so that the selected units are spread across the batch.&lt;ref name=nist260-125&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equal number of subsamples  (usually two or three) is then taken from each CRM unit and measured. Subsamples are measured in random order.&lt;ref name=guide35 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nist260-125 /&gt; Other designs, such as [[randomized block design]]s, have also been used for CRM certification.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Data processing for homogeneity tests usually involves a [[statistical hypothesis test|statistical significance test]] for  evidence of differences between units of the candidate CRM. For the simple balanced design above, this typically uses an [[F test]] following [[analysis of variance|ANOVA]]. A check for trends with production order is also recommended.&lt;ref name=nist260-125 /&gt;
This approach is not taken in ISO Guide 35:2017; rather, emphasis is placed on deciding whether the between-unit standard deviation is sufficiently small for the intended end use. If statistical tests are used, however, the homogeneity experiment should be capable of detecting important heterogeneity, ISO Guide 35:2017 in turn requiring a sufficient combination of precision of the measurement procedure, number of RM units and number of replicates per unit. Statistical power calculations can assist in ensuring a sufficiently effective test .&lt;ref name=guide35 /&gt;

In extreme cases, such as microanalysis, materials must be checked for homogeneity on sub-micron scales; this may involve much larger numbers of observations and adjustments to statistical analysis.&lt;ref name=mattiuzzi&gt;{{cite web

===Stability assessment===

====Stability assessment and testing strategies====
Stability is among the essential properties of a CRM (see [[#ISO_REMCO_definitions|definitions]] above), and stability assessment is accordingly required for certified reference materials.&lt;ref name="who932_annex2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=standard17034/&gt; Stability under long term storage and also under conditions of transport are both expected to be assessed.&lt;ref name=standard17034/&gt; "Assessment" is not synonymous with "testing"; some materials - for example, many minerals and metal alloys - may be so stable that experimental tests are not considered necessary.&lt;ref name="Bokhari2014"&gt;{{cite web

Where reference materials are certified for more than one property, stability is expected to be demonstrated for every certified property.&lt;ref name=standard17034 /&gt;

There are two important strategies for CRM stability testing; simple real-time studies and accelerated testing. Real-time studies simply keep units of the material at their planned storage temperature for a suitable period of time and observe the material at intervals. Accelerated studies use a range of more stringent conditions, most commonly increased temperature, to test whether the material is likely to be stable over longer time scales.

====Real-time stability studies====
Real-time stability studies simply hold a set of RM units at a proposed storage temperature and test a proportion of them at regular intervals. The results are usually assessed by inspection and by [[linear regression]] to determine whether there is a significant change in measured value over time.&lt;ref name="guide35" /&gt;

====Accelerated stability studies====
Accelerated studies have been in use since at least the mid-1950s, at least for biological reference materials.&lt;ref name=jerneperry1956&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, CRMs are monitored at a range of temperatures and the results are used to predict the rate of change at a proposed, usuallu low, storage temperature. Often, the prediction uses a well known degradation model such as an [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius model]].&lt;ref name="who932_annex2" /&gt; The advantage over real-time studies is that results are available sooner and predictions of stability over a much longer period than the stability study can be defended. For some applications, accelerated studies have been described as the only practical approach:&lt;ref name="WHO2006"&gt;{{cite web

{{Quote|text=In the absence of a reference method or a higher order standard,  ... accelerated studies under stress conditions provide the only approach for assessment of stability|author=World Health Organisation}}

The principal disadvantage of accelerated studies is that reference materials, like any other material, can degrade for unexpected reasons over time, or can degrade following different [[Chemical kinetics|kinetic models]]; predictions can then become unreliable.&lt;ref name="Linsinger2004"&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Isochronous studies====
In most stability studies, real-time or accelerated, a few units of the reference material are tested at intervals. If the measurement system used for testing the materials is not perfectly stable, this can generate imprecise data or can be mistaken for instability of the material. To overcome these difficulties, it is often possible to move RM units, at intervals, to some reference temperature where they remain stable, and then test all the accumulated units - which have undergone different exposure times - at the same time. This is referred to as an isochronous study. This strategy has the advantage of improving the precision of data used in assessing stability at the cost of delaying results until the end of the stability study period.&lt;ref name="Linsinger2004" /&gt;

'''Charles Louis Flint''' (May 8, 1824 – February 26, 1889) was a [[lawyer]], cofounder and first secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture, a lecturer in cattle and dairy farming, the first secretary of the [[Massachusetts Agricultural College]] Board of Trustees (now known as the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]) and the college's fourth president.

Flint was born in [[Middleton, Massachusetts|Middleton]], [[Massachusetts]], on May 8, 1824.  He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1849 and entered the Law School in 1850.  In 1853, he became secretary of the newly formed Massachusetts Board of Agriculture, remaining in that position for 27 years. He was a member of the Boston School Committee and was involved in founding of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

Flint was one of the founders of the [[Massachusetts Agricultural College]], where he lectured on dairy farming for four years. He served as elected secretary of the Board of Trustees for 22 years. On the resignation of President Clark during a budgetary crisis in 1879, Flint was elected president and served without a salary. After reorganizing the debt-ridden college with some success, he placed his resignation in the spring of 1880, and eventually left his post as secretary of the college board in 1885. In the later years of his life, Flint worked as president of the New England Mortgage Security Company, and remained an active member of the [[Massachusetts Horticultural Society]] and the [[Boston Society of Natural History]]. After a period of declining health he died during a trip to the South, on February 26, 1889 at a hotel in [[Sharon, Georgia|Hillman]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

==Education and early life==
Charles Flint, born in [[Middleton, Massachusetts]] on May 8, 1824, was the second son of farmers Jeremiah and Mary Flint (née Howard).&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hurd |first1=Duane Hamilton |title=History of Essex County, Massachusetts, with biographical sketches of many of its pioneers and prominent men  |url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofessexco01hurd#page/n3/mode/2up |accessdate=2011-07-01 |year=1888 |publisher=J.W.

Charles Flint and his siblings would be the seventh generation to farm on the family's heirloom estate; as a child, much of his time was divided between doing chores on the farm and attending school in the winter, both of which unquestionably influenced his careers in agriculture and education later in life.&lt;ref name=one/&gt;&lt;ref name=two/&gt; At the age of 12 everything changed when his mother died, and after the two years that followed he was sent to live with his uncle, owner a large farm in [[Norway, Maine]]&lt;ref name=one/&gt; There he would continue his studies in the local school, dedicating much of his remaining time to working on his uncle's farm. Flint would credit this entire turn of events as what ultimately gave him his drive as well as his ability to write concisely and fervently about agricultural, but his passion for writing had only begun to manifest itself. It was around this time that a teacher of his, having not accomplished the same, convinced him that to get liberal education in order benefit him in his future interests; ever determined to better himself, Flint left Maine at the age of 17, enrolling in the [[Phillips Academy]] of [[Andover, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=one/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andover.edu/about/notablealumni/longlist/Pages/1800s.aspx Notable Alumni- 1800s] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105222945/http://www.andover.edu/About/NotableAlumni/LongList/Pages/1800s.aspx# |date=2013-11-05 }}, Philips Academy.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately Flint would later attribute these trying times for his poor health in later years, having to constantly support himself while gaining his education.&lt;ref name=two/&gt; He would graduate from Philips in 1845, entering [[Harvard]] in the fall of that same year; ever having trust in the future, Flint attended both institutions virtually unaided financially. To pay for schooling he would constantly contribute essays, stories and prose to whichever publishers would accept them. One day, while waiting in the [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] railroad depot, Flint noticed an ad for the [[Topsfield, Massachusetts#Annual events|Essex Agricultural Society]] offering a $20 prize for the best essay on [[Indian corn]], after a moment's consideration, Flint decided to give it a chance. Upon returning to Cambridge he began to research the subject, becoming increasingly interested in its history until, by the time he had finished, it was a thorough history of the crop going back to its introduction as a staple to human civilization.&lt;ref name=two/&gt; Flint's essay would not only win the prize, but years later this paper would be responsible for his career as the Secretary of the Board of Agriculture.&lt;ref name=two/&gt;  In addition to this Flint entered several literary contests, winning $40&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Approx. equivalent to $1000 in 2010 US currency.

After four years of rigorous schooling and working to pay for this education, Flint graduated from Harvard debt-free, with honors, in the class of 1849.&lt;ref name=one/&gt;

==Massachusetts Board of Agriculture==
The organization of the [[Massachusetts Department of Food and Agriculture|Massachusetts Board of Agriculture]] had begun following the Governor's signing of its Act of Legislation on April 21, 1852, around the same time that Flint was finishing his studies in law.&lt;ref name=twentyfifth&gt;{{cite book |last1=Flint |first1=Charles L. |title=Twenty-Fifth Annual Report of the Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture |url=https://archive.org/stream/annualreportofse25mass#page/n7/mode/2up |accessdate=2011-07-03 |year=1878 |publisher=Rand, Avery &amp; Co., Printers to the Commonwealth |location=Boston |pages=258–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by the Hon. [[Marshall P. Wilder]], a merchant and advocate of agricultural education for more than a decade prior, the goal was to create a permanent government body that would accurately gather statistics on the crop returns of the county agricultural societies as well as provide a forum for the advancement of the state's agriculture.&lt;ref name=one/&gt;&lt;ref name=two/&gt;&lt;ref name=firstreport&gt;{{cite book |last1=Flint |first1=Charles L. |title=First Annual Report of the Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture |url=https://archive.org/stream/annualreportofse01mass#page/n11/mode/2up |accessdate=2011-07-03 |year=1854 |publisher=William White, Printer to the State |location=Boston |pages=15–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This Board was to be a representative body reporting to the state's [[Massachusetts Senate|senate]] and [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|house]], connected with to executive government with the [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts|Lieutenant Governor]] and [[Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth|Secretary of the Commonwealth]] serving as members ''[[ex officio|ex officiis]]''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Within the time that Flint was involved with the Board, the State Agricultural Chemist (known for a time as the "State Inspector of Fertilizers") and President of the Massachusetts Agricultural College would be added as two more members ex officiis. ''See the Fourteenth and Twenty-First Annual Reports of the Secretary of the Mass. Board of Agr.''&lt;/ref&gt; The governor and this executive council would then appoint 3 members considered of scientific background, with the remaining membership being elected delegates from each county agricultural society, serving in terms of 3 years each.&lt;ref name=one/&gt;

The first order of business for the Board would be to find a secretary of competent administrative ability but familiar with the sciences as well; Wilder saw such a figure is as imperative for the organization's survival. Initially the members petitioned [[Edward Hitchcock|Dr. Edward Hitchcock]], the president of [[Amherst College]], to fill the position, to which he consistently declined.&lt;ref name=twentyfifth/&gt;  By this time Charles Flint had gained some distinction in the field of agricultural studies, having been a regular contributor to the Boston monthly "Journal of Agriculture", many of his articles had been reprinted in other periodicals in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name=two/&gt; After reading Flint's essay on Indian corn, which had received two prizes by this time, Wilder and the other members of the Board became convinced that he was just the person they needed to fill the position.&lt;ref name=one/&gt; He was immediate writ a letter by a member of the Board, asking what he believed the duties of such a title would involve, to which Flint, ignorant to the fact that he was their prime candidate, responded to in great length.&lt;ref name=one/&gt; The Board was exceedingly impressed by this and promptly invited him to take the position, to which Flint emphatically declined.&lt;ref name=one/&gt; He felt that it would be a complete change from everything he had spent his life planning for, but after persistent solicitation by former Governor [[Edward Everett|Everett]], Wilder and others, along with the consultation of several close friends, Flint ultimately renounced his New York practice and accepted the position.&lt;ref name=one/&gt;&lt;ref name=two/&gt; Flint began his duties on February 14, 1853, spending the first several months conducting research at the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] of [[New Haven, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=one/&gt;&lt;ref name=firstreport/&gt; He would hold this position for 27 years.&lt;ref name=one/&gt;&lt;ref name=two/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/physicalplant/memorials/buildings/flint.html Flint Laboratory], Memorial Buildings, UMass Amherst&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until the time of the Board's founding (and those in other states) agricultural science had been in a state of relative neglect in this country, with the small amount of literature printed mainly being reprints from European journals, and the journals of other sciences, industry and the arts dwarfing the agricultural literature that did exist. Over the next two decades Flint would help to rectify this through the publishing of numerous annual reports and outside literature. Some examples of this include the first of his reports which contained an extensive history of agriculture in the Commonwealth, the fourth of which contained a treatise on "Grasses and Foraging Plants", a revised edition of [[Thaddeus William Harris|Harris's]] Injurious Insects, and a 450 book on "Milch Cows and Dairy Farming", all of which would go on to be printed for several more editions. His work was well received: [[Paul A. Chadbourne]], a board member and future president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College himself, once stated Flint's treatise on grasses "embodies the most practical and scientific information on the history, culture and nutritive value of the grasses and the grains. His style of writing is plain, simple, forcible and judiciously adapted to the ends he has in view. The large number of illustrations of the different species of grasses are drawn with great care and accuracy, and greatly facilitate the study and identification of unknown specimens."&lt;ref name=one/&gt;

After 25 years of service, Flint submitted his resignation to the Board. Originally he had been told that, ideally, he would hold the position for some twenty years, and having contemplated leaving for some years prior, Flint had decided that the time was overdue.&lt;ref name=twentyfifth/&gt; After consideration, the committee declined his resignation, unanimously adopting the following resolution:&lt;ref name=twentyfifth/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Wheras'', Hon. Charles L. Flint has presented to the Board a statement concerning his connection with the same during the past twenty-five years, and has offered his resignation as secretary:&lt;br&gt;
''Resolved'', That the Board desires to express its high appreciation of the valuable services of Secretary Flint, and hereby earnestly requests him to withdraw his resignation, and continue the good work on behalf of the agricultural interests of the Commonwealth, in which he has achieved so enviable a reputation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Marshall Wilder also added to the resolution the following amendment:&lt;ref name=twentyfifth/&gt;

''Resolved'', That the thanks and gratitiude of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture are eminently due to the Hon. Charles L. Flint, for the ability and fidelity with which he has discharged the duties of secretary for the last twenty-five years, in a manner alike honorable to the Commonwealth, and beneficial to its people.&lt;br&gt;

===International work===
In summer of 1862, Flint took an extended break in Europe during which he would pass through multiple countries and communicate with the farmers from each one. While passing through Germany, many of these farmers conversed with him about a grand-scale International Exhibition in [[Hamburg, Germany|Hamburg]] being planned July of the following year. It was to his surprise when, in the spring of 1863, the Board of Agriculture (along with every other state and Federal agricultural body) was given an invitation to attend this convention. The Board decided to name a commissioner to travel with the other state officials who would be in attendance, to which Flint received the appointment "unsought and unexpected[ly]".&lt;ref name=eleventh&gt;{{cite book |last1=Flint |first1=Charles L. |title=Eleventh Annual Report of the Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CncZAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-07-04 |year=1864 |publisher=Wright &amp; Potter, State Printers |location=Boston |page=105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His detailed account of the exposition can be found in the Board's [https://archive.org/stream/annualreportofse1163mass#page/n109/mode/2up/search/hamburg Eleventh Annual Report].

In 1863, Flint was elected Secretary of the Board of Trustees of the Massachusetts Agricultural College, the land-grant college that had been founded that same year under the recently passed [[Morrill Act]]; he would hold this position for the next 22 years.&lt;ref name=townhist&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carpenter |first1=Edward Wilton |last2=Morehouse |first2=Charles Frederick |title=The History of the Town of Amherst, Massachusetts  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAk1AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-07-04 |year=1896 |publisher=Carpenter &amp; Morehouse |volume=I |location=Amherst, MA |oclc= 2565330 |pages=558–559 |chapter=Chapter LXI |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAk1AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22March%2024%22%20Charles%20L%20Flint%20Massachusetts%20Agricultural&amp;pg=PA553#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flint would also give a series of courses on dairy farming from 1868 to 1872, the subject for which a campus laboratory bearing his name would later be built for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Henry Hill Goodell: the story of his life, with letters and a few of his addresses |last=Stebbins |first=Calvin K. |authorlink= |year=1911|page=282 |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Riverside Press |oclc=11485888|url=https://archive.org/stream/henryhillgoodell00steb#page/n3/mode/2up|accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dairylab&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/annualreport49mass#page/n39/mode/2up MAC Annual Report, March 1912], pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fifteenth&gt;{{cite book |last1=Flint |first1=Charles L. |title=Fifteenth Annual Report of the Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CncZAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-07-04 |year=1868 |publisher=Wright &amp; Potter, State Printers |location=Boston |page=251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the time of its founding the college had gone through 3 presidents: [[Henry F. French]], who resigned after 2 years of service, [[Paul A. Chadbourne]], a member of the Board of Agriculture who had to leave the post due to ill health, and [[William S. Clark]], now considered the college founder as the first president to admit students.&lt;ref name=formerchanc&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/chancellor/formerchancellors.html Former Chancellors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523233433/http://www.umass.edu/chancellor/formerchancellors.html# |date=2012-05-23 }}, Office of the Chancellor, UMass Amherst&lt;/ref&gt; For a time the college was considered a success while under Clark's leadership, however by the end of the 1870s enrollment had gone into steady decline, with no admissions from the farming region of Berkshire County in 1870 and less than 20 students admitted in the entering class of 1875.&lt;ref name=onehundred&gt;{{cite book |title=The University of Massachusetts; a history of one hundred years |last=Cary |first=Harold Whiting |authorlink= |year=1962 |place=Springfield, Mass. |publisher=Walter Whittum, Inc. |oclc=1029116 |url=https://archive.org/stream/universityofmass00cary#page/n7/mode/2up |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decline in students and revenue, along with the college's needs for a library and laboratories, was causing the institution to lose thousands with each passing year.&lt;ref name=onehundred/&gt; Clark was accused of incompetence, to which he would retort with consistent blame to the state for not providing the college with facilities, and the farming community for its indifference to the matter. As the situation worsened, agricultural societies began to discontinue their scholarships, there was no new support to be found from the state and between 1874 and 1877 the college's credit was upheld only by the personal backing of one of its trustees, William Knowlton.&lt;ref name=onehundred/&gt; During Clark's time at [[Sapporo Agricultural College|Sapporo]], Flint advocated for the state to give the college some two hundred scholarships from revenue that had been made from dog license fees. In the preceding year, the college had cut its veterinary science program in the face of mounting debt, leading the newspapers to call the move a "weakening of instruction".&lt;ref name=onehundred/&gt; Unfortunately Flint and the trustees' pleas for scholarship funding fell on deaf ears, as the legislature of that year only allotted a small sum for paying for student labor on the college farm.&lt;ref name=onehundred/&gt; In the next couple years journalists would continue to condemn the institution, with the [[Boston Globe]] insisting the school be abolished, and the [[Springfield Republican]] stating the college would serve better as a [[trade school]]; other cries from the Governor's office suggested that the college be turned over to [[Amherst College]] as an agricultural department.&lt;ref name=onehundred/&gt; The farming community hadn't embraced the college as a whole, the institution faced still-mounting debt and many at [[Massachusetts General Court|Beacon Hill]] had begun to declare the college a failure; Clark resigned on May 1, 1879, weary of "time serving politicians and unprincipled newspapers seeking only to float on the tide of public opinion."&lt;ref name=browne&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Browne |first=Patrick T.J |authorlink= |author2= |title=Cultivation of the Higher Self: William Smith Clark and Agricultural Education |journal=Historical Journal of Massachusetts |volume=36 |issue=Winter 2008 |pages= |publisher=Westfield State College |issn=0276-8313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eightyoneindex&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/index1881univ#page/6/mode/2up Mass.

In order to survive, the college would need to undergo a period of reorganization, something which had never been done up to that time in its nearly 20-year existence. At a meeting of the trustees later in May 1879, the situation was seen as particularly grave and it was decided that it wouldn't be likely nor beneficial to call in an outsider, thus Charles L. Flint was unanimously elected to serve as the president of the college. Reluctantly, Flint accepted and would hold the title without pay, as well as his other secretarial duties until his resignation on March 24 of the following year.&lt;ref name=one/&gt;&lt;ref name=GoodellCatalogue&gt;{{cite book |title=General Catalogue of the Massachusetts Agriculture College, 1862-1886 |last1=Goodell |first1=H.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As secretary of the Board of Agriculture, trustee and president of the Agricultural College, and author of various standard works on agricultural topics, the name of Charles Louis Flint will long be remembered and revered...When, in 1879, William S. Clark resigned the presidency of the college, Mr. Flint reluctantly consented to assume its responsibilities, and for a year, during perhaps the most stormy period of its existence, guided it in safety through the troubled waters. He believed in the college most thoroughly, and emphasized his convictions by both precept and example, sending to it his two sons for education. Through all the vicissitudes of its earlier years he was its firm friend, and to him it is deeply indebted for advice and services. He gave it his best efforts, and he gave them cheerfully. A lecturer at the college, without compensation, he presented the individual members of its first classes with copies of each of his works on "Milch Cows" and "Forage Plants ;" a president, without pay, he gave his services without a murmur, asking for no reward save that arising from the consciousness of having performed his duty; and in almost the last years of his life he gave a substantial token of his interest, subscribing a thousand dollars to the permanent library fund of the college."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the time Flint had resigned from his duties as president, the accumulated debt had been paid off by the state, "as a man puts money into a contribution box"&lt;ref name=eightyoneindex/&gt; states the 1881 Index, and the college had reduced its annual expenses by $10,000.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Equivalent to the end cost of overall salary expenditures for that year. Approx. equal to $225,000 in 2010 U.S. currency.

In the year that followed, Flint would also resign from his duties on the Board of Agriculture, but would remain on the college's Board of Trustees until 1885.&lt;ref name=GoodellCatalogue/&gt; Following the three short-lived tenures of [[Levi Stockbridge|Stockbridge]], [[Paul A.

===Massachusetts Institute of Technology===
Funding from the [[Morrill Acts]] not only provided income for the Massachusetts Agricultural College but endowed the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] as well. Flint was also instrumental in the creation of this institution, and spent a number of years serving on its founding committees, including the original Committee of Twenty, Committee of Publication, Committee of Associated Institutions, and the Back Bay Lands Committee.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Before moving to the Cambridge campus, the Institute was located at a smaller campus in Boston for its first fifty years.

Flint is described as an "ardent worker"&lt;ref name=two/&gt;&lt;ref name=three/&gt; in the founding of the institute, and would also serve on a committee of three alongside founding president [[William Barton Rogers|William Rogers]] and secretary [[Thomas Hopkins Webb|Thomas Webb]].

===Boston Public Schools===
Flint took up residence in Boston during his time with the Board of Agriculture, and would remain involved in the city's school committee for a number of years there.

For years he had been plagued with poor health, and would frequently take train rides south to recuperate for weeks at a time; accompanied by friend and associate O.B. Hadwen, his last trip proved too little and too much. After arriving days earlier, Charles Louis Flint died at the Electric Mound Hotel of [[Sharon, Georgia|Hillman, Georgia]] on Tuesday, February 26, 1889, at the age of 64.&lt;ref name=two/&gt;&lt;ref name=globeobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=geneal&gt;{{cite journal| editor1-last  = Dean| editor1-first = John Ward|date=April 1889| title = Scientific News| journal =  [[The New England Historical and Genealogical Register]]| volume = XLIII| pages = 214–215| location = Boston| publisher = David Clapp and Sons| accessdate = 2011-07-14| url  = https://books.google.com/?id=6i0wTJbBYpUC&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PA214#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Though he left the Board of Agriculture in 1880, the name Charles Flint would not be forgotten by its members with many of their later publications paying him tribute. William Sessions, the third secretary of the board said of Flint in 1893, "Time would fail me were I to describe the work accomplished by the first secretary...in the twenty seven years he served the Board."&lt;ref name=fortieth&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sessions |first1=William R. |title=Fortieth Annual Report of the Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CncZAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-07-17 |year=1893 |publisher=Wright &amp; Potter Printing Company, State Printers |location=Boston |pages=250, 351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year a portrait of Flint was donated to the Board by one of his sons, it would hang in the organization's office for a number of years, though its current whereabouts are unknown.&lt;ref name=fortieth/&gt;

The [[Flint Public Library|Charles Flint Public Library]], of [[Middleton, Massachusetts]] was established in 1891 with a $15,000&lt;ref group=note&gt;Conflicting accounts- according to the Flint Public Library $10,000 dollars were bequeathed to the town whereas an 1889 New York Times notice states the amount was $15,000 dollars.&lt;/ref&gt; endowment left to the town in Flint's will.&lt;ref name=charit&gt;{{cite news |title=Charitable Bequests |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York |date=March 23, 1889|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cultobit&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Minor Items |journal=The Cultivator &amp; Country Gentleman |volume=54 |issue=April 4, 1889 |page=275 |publisher=Luther Tucker &amp; Son|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96VMAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=1889%20%22charles%20L.%20flint%22%20electric&amp;pg=PA275#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this time however, all other libraries of the town had been impermanent and with notably sparse collections. When the Flint Library was established it had a total of 5,000 volumes, compared with the present library collection which currently contains upwards of "40,000 books, 1300 videotapes, 1100 audiotapes and subscriptions to 185 periodicals." &lt;ref name=flintlib&gt;[http://www.flintlibrary.org/aboutus.html About Us], Flint Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

Flint would also donate $10,000 to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], $5,000 to the [[New England Historic Genealogical Society|Genealogical]] and [[Boston Society of Natural History|Natural History]] societies, $5,000 to the [[Phillips Academy]] in the name of a scholarship, and $1,000 to the Massachusetts Home of Intemperate Women.&lt;ref name=charit/&gt;&lt;ref name=cultobit/&gt; Of the $10,000 donated to MIT, $5,000 would be dedicated to a scholarship fund in "support of some worthy student, [with] preference to be given some graduate of the English High School, Boston".&lt;ref name=mitbulletin&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e1AVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Charles+Lewia+Flint+Fund+(1119)+This+bequest+of+$5000+from+Charles+L.+Flint+is+for+the+%22support+of+some+worthy+student,+preference+to+be+given+to+some+graduate+of+the+English+High+School,+Boston.%22&amp;dq=Charles+Lewia+Flint+Fund+(1119)+This+bequest+of+$5000+from+Charles+L.+Flint+is+for+the+%22support+of+some+worthy+student,+preference+to+be+given+to+some+graduate+of+the+English+High+School,+Boston.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NEsUTvqLJIn50gG8_YjkDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA Bulletin], Volume 98, Issue 5, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of writing, the Hon. Charles L. Flint lives on in name alone, with much of his and others' works of the 19th century agricultural science movement having fallen into relative obscurity in the last century. At the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] [[Flint Laboratory|a dairy laboratory]] was built in his name in 1912, however the proposal for the building only credits him as the "fourth president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College", lacking mention of his extensive work in the state's other agricultural and educational affairs.&lt;ref name=dairylab/&gt; The building, known as Flint Laboratory, has since been converted into offices for use by the [http://www.isenberg.umass.edu/htm/ Department of Hospitality and Tourism Management].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isenberg.umass.edu/htm/Contact_Information/ Contact information], Department of Hospitality and Tourism Management, Isenberg School, UMass Amherst&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chinese Medical Herbology and Pharmacology''''' is a text on [[Chinese herbology]] by Dr. John K. Chen and Tina T. Chen. It is one of the few comprehensive texts on Chinese [[herbology]] in existence that has been published in the English and German language, and it is widely recognized by the [[oriental medicine]] community as both a valid teaching tool used in many [[oriental medicine]] universities in the US, as well as a reference book that is widely cited by many academic individuals and practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Typhonium Plus |url=http://www.typhoniumplus.com/chinese-medical-herbology.html |title=Chinese Medical Herbology Typhonium Plus |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herbaltherapeutics.net/recommendedreading.htm |title=David's Recommended Reading List |publisher=Herbaltherapeutics.net |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aimc.edu/current-students/registrar/textbooks/ |title=Textbooks &amp;#124; |publisher=Aimc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aoma.edu/current-students/academics/textbooks/ |title=Textbooks - AOMA Graduate School of Integrative Medicine |publisher=Aoma.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacredlotus.com/about/references.cfm |title=Sacred Lotus Arts - References |publisher=Sacredlotus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the traditional and modern uses of Chinese herbology, this text is also a tremendous source that details clinical studies and research, safety data and [[toxicology]], as well as western [[pharmacological]] and herb-drug interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilaaom.org/books.html |title=Book Reviews |publisher=Ilaaom.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henriettesherbal.com/faqs/medi-6-1-books.html |title=6.1 Good Books on Herbs and Herbal Medicine &amp;#124; Henriette's Herbal Homepage |publisher=Henriettesherbal.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text is also part of the required knowledge from the national ([[NCCAOM]]) as well as many state [[Acupuncture]] licensing boards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nccaom.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Chinese%20Herbology%20Study%20Guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acupuncture.ca.gov/students/exam_preparation&lt;/ref&gt; It has been and continues to be cited in many published articles and papers on Chinese Herbal Medicine, especially those that cover the subject of pharmacological and herbal interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shonez |first=Billy |url=http://www.nyctcm.edu/acupuncture-tcm-blog/2011/02/the-benefits-of-cinnamon.html |title=The Benefits of Cinnamon - Acupuncture &amp; TCM Blog |publisher=Nyctcm.edu |date=2011-02-26 |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thieme-connect.com/ejournals/html/plantamedica/doi/10.1055/s-0029-1186218 |title=Thieme eJournals - Full Text Article |publisher=Thieme-connect.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerhelps.com/research/chinese_medical_herbology.htm |title=Chinese Medical Herbology and Pharmacology |publisher=Cancerhelps.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MichaelW |url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/97251-chinese-healing-herbs-breast-cancer/ |title=Chinese Healing Herbs For Breast Cancer |publisher=Livestrong.Com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=30404 |title=The Treatment of Pertussis (Whooping Cough) With Chinese Herbal Medicine, Part One |publisher=Acupuncturetoday.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chronica Jutensis''''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Jyske Krønike'' [[English language|English]]: ''Jutland Chronicle'') also known as '''''Continuatio compendii Saxonis''''' or '''''Chronica Danorum''''', is a small [[Denmark|Danish]] historical work from the middle of the 14th century, written in [[Latin]]. It comes with a smaller summary edition, about one-fourth the size of the original, of [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]’s ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', known as ''[[Compendium Saxonis]]''.

The original manuscript is lost; however the work survives in four different handwritten copies, about a hundred years younger. One of them was written by a monk from [[Odense]] in 1431. 

The stories of ''Chronica Jutensis'' begin approximately where ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' ends, in King [[Canute VI]]'s reign, just before King [[Valdemar II]] gains the throne, and end with the beginning of King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark|Valdemar Atterdag]]'s reign, about 1342.

It was written somewhere around 1342&amp;ndash;1350. Since the book does not mention [[Estonia]] being sold to the [[Livonian Order]], which happened on 29 September 1346, it must have been written before this date or only shortly after. It would probably not be common knowledge for a few years, so it may have been written after 1346.

The author is not known. It is, however, thought that he was from [[Jutland]] because Jutland events and persons are thoroughly described and it seems that the writer is confident with both the [[topography]] and persons of Jutland.

Latin copies reside in:
* [[Danish Royal Library]] of [[Copenhagen]], Add.. 49 2o (1431)
* [[Den Arnamagnæanske Samling]], Copenhagen, AM 107 8o (16th century).
* Riksarkivet, [[Stockholm]], Skokloster 47 4o (15th century).
* [[Uppsala University Library]], De la Gardie 44 4o (15th century).

This gallery shows:
* [[Bar chart|Bar/Column chart]] - uses bars/columns to show frequencies or values for different categories.
* [[Line chart]] - two-dimensional [[Scatter plot|Scatterplot]] of ordered observations where the observations are connected following their order.
* [[Pie chart]] - shows percentage values as a slice of a pie.
* [[Area chart]] - line chart which displays graphically quantitive data. The area between axis and line are commonly emphasized with colors, textures and hatchings.
* [[Scatter plot]] - type of mathematical diagram using [[Cartesian coordinates]] to display values as collection of points for two variables for a set of data.
* [[Radar chart|Circular charts]] - [[Radar chart]] (Spider chart) or [[Pie chart#Polar area pie chart|Polar chart]] is a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point.
* [[Population pyramid|Accumulation charts]] - Pyramid (Cone) or Funnel chart displays data that, when combined, equals 100%.
* [[Treemapping|Tree/Heat map]] - chart where the areas of the rectangles correspond to values. Other dimensions can be represented with colour or [[hue]].
* [[Candlestick chart|Finance chart]] - [[stock market]] prices are often depicted with an [[open-high-low-close chart]] with a traditional bar chart of volume at the bottom.
* [[Cartogram|Cartogram chart]] is a map in which some thematic mapping variable – such as population, economic etc. – is substituted for land area.
* [[Gantt chart]] - helps in scheduling complex projects.
* [[Dependency graph]] is a [[directed graph]] representing dependencies of several objects towards each other.
* [[Nomogram]] - a two-dimensional diagram designed to allow the approximate graphical computation of a function: it uses a [[coordinate system]] other than Cartesian coordinates.
* [[Organizational chart]] is a diagram that shows the [[structure]] of an [[organization]] and the relationships and relative ranks of its parts and positions/jobs.
* [[Flowchart|Flow chart]] - a diagram, that represents an [[algorithm]] or [[Process (computing)|process]], showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting these with arrows.

&lt;!-- IMPORTANT  NOTE  –  READ  BEFORE  ADDING  AN  ENTRY
This is a list of NOTABLE feed aggregators, as judged by Wikipedia's notability policies, obtained by searching Wikipedia for WP:N. Please don't add external links or wikilinks to nonexistent articles – instead, read our notability policies and write the article first, ensuring to demonstrate notability. Entries without articles, redlinks, external links, and links to articles that aren't about the aggregator in question will be pruned periodically. Fill in the background info too, please, to make this article useful.
Important note ends. --&gt;

The following is a '''comparison of [[RSS]] [[feed aggregator]]s'''. Often e-mail programs and web browsers have the ability to display RSS feeds. They are listed here, too.

Many [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] [[BitTorrent client|clients]] support RSS feeds for [[broadcatching]] (see [[Comparison of BitTorrent clients]]).

With the rise of Cloud computing, some cloud based services offer feed aggregation. They are listed here as well.

'''''Diamond'''''  was built by John Crichton &amp; Co. of Saltney, Chester for Midland and Coast Canal Carrying Company of Wolverhampton. The boat was built in Chester in 1927 and  first registered at Wolverhampton in 1928. She was one of six iron boats in the fleet fitted with two cabins for long distance traffic between the Black Country and the ports on the Mersey Estuary. Having been damaged during an air raid on Birmingham in 1944 she was sold for scrap to Ernest Thomas by Fellows, Morton &amp; Clayton who had by then acquired Midlands and Coast. Rebuilt and renamed ‘Henry’ she carried coal until the 1960s when she was resold to ‘Caggy’ Stevens of Oldbury and renamed ‘Susan’.
It is now owned by the [[Black Country Living Museum]], where it is based and can be seen dockside in the Lord Ward’s Canal Arm at the [[Black Country Living Museum]] in Dudley.
Diamond is on the ''[[National Historic Ships]]'' register.

The '''''Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines d'après les textes et les monuments, contenant l'explication des termes qui se rapportent aux mœurs, aux institutions, à la religion, aux arts, aux sciences, au costume, au mobilier, à la guerre, à la marine, aux métiers, aux monnaies, poids et mesures, etc. etc., et en général à la vie publique et privée des anciens''''' was a large illustrated [[French language|French-language]] [[dictionary]] of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] edited by [[Charles Victor Daremberg]] and [[Edmond Saglio]] and published in 10 volumes between 1873 and 1919 by the publisher [[Hachette Livre]] in [[Paris]]. Individual entries consisted of (sometimes book-length) articles by prominent [[Classics|classical]] scholars, [[François Lenormant]] among them. It aimed to compete directly with the ''Altertumswissenschaft'' of German universities, who were the uncontested masters in the field from 1810 onward. In an 1887 review of the first volume of the ''Dictionnaire'' for ''The Classical Review'', John E. B. Mayor praised the result, saying "No other nation as yet possesses anything approaching to it in beauty and completeness; it is absolutely necessary to every classical library and to every public library frequented by scholars or artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mayor | first = John E. B. | title = Review of Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines d'après les textes et les monuments, contenant l'explication des termes qui se rapportent aux mœurs, aux institutions, à la religion, aux arts, aux sciences, au costume, au mobilier, à la guerre, à la marine, aux métiers, aux monnaies, poids et mesures, etc. etc., et en général à la vie publique et privée des anciens | journal = The Classical Review | volume = 1 | issue = 7 | pages = 201–202 |date=July 1887 | |doi=10.1017/S0009840X00182423|jstor=691131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dictionnaire'' represented a work of extraordinary volume and was published at a slow pace. It took eleven issuings to finally complete volume 1, which spanned 1,703 pages and only covered through the letter C, in 1886. The first volume included 3,000 illustrations. Each of the eleven parts of the first volume, printed in large [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|quarto]] form, was sold for five [[French franc|francs]]. Some thirty years after it was begun, the ''Dictionnaire'' had only reached the middle of the alphabet.

Today the dictionary has value as a legacy work, amongst the other large dictionaries of antiquity that appeared in Europe around the same time: starting in 1893, the Germans published the monumental ''[[Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft]]'' in eighty-three volumes; the Italian ''Dizionario epigrafico di antichità romana'' began in 1886; the English also published several dictionaries concerning the fields of [[classical antiquity]], including [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]'s 1,300-page ''[[A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]'', first published in 1842.

Although the articles are sourced from scholarship in a number of different fields, its contents are no longer up-to-date because of [[archaeology|archaeological]], [[epigraphy|epigraphical]], and [[numismatics|numismatic]] discoveries made in the years since the ''Dictionnaire'''s writing. The problems of studies of classical antiquity have also been profoundly renewed in the intervening years thanks to the contributions of [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], fields from which specialists in antiquity have integrated the methods.

'''Domains by Proxy''' (DBP) is an [[Internet]] company owned by [[GoDaddy]] founder [[Bob Parsons]].  It offers [[domain privacy]] services through partner [[domain registrars]] such as Go Daddy and Wild West Domains.

Subscribers list Domains by Proxy as their administrative and technical contacts in the Internet's [[WHOIS]] database, thereby delegating responsibility for managing unsolicited contacts from third parties and keeping the domains owners' personal information secret.  However, the company will release a registrant's personal information in some cases, such as by court order &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com/Private+domains+not+so+private/2100-1038_3-5833663.html Private domains not so private? | CNET News.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dbp_agreement"&gt;[http://www.domainsbyproxy.com/policy/ShowDoc.aspx?pageid=domain_nameproxy# Domains By Proxy Domain Proxy Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt; or for other reasons as deemed appropriate by the company per its Domain Name Proxy Agreement.&lt;ref name="dbp_agreement" /&gt;  

Over 9,850,000 domain names currently use the Domains by Proxy service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of 9,863,496 domain names using Domains By Proxy|url=https://whoisology.com/organization/archive_6/domains+by+proxy%2c+llc|website=Whoisology.com|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political usage==
In the run-up to the 2012 [[United States presidential primaries]], numerous domain names with derogatory expressions have been registered through Domains by Proxy by both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;Rucker, P. and Farnam, T.W. ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-campaign-2012-web-sites-are-the-new-real-estate/2011/10/17/gIQACSpssL_story.html?hpid=z3 In Campaign 2012, Web sites are the new real estate.]'' The Washington Post, 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domains by Proxy have allegedly been a target of the Internet organization [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] due to perceived malicious business activities including inducements to join their service, claims of privacy that are not fulfilled and the lowering of Google [[PageRank]] of the sites they link to.{{citation needed|date=April 2012|reason=This whole section seems very flaky}}

==Controversy==
===Fraudsters===
Controversially, Domains By Proxy is also used by a number of organizations such as Clearance.co that target vulnerable individuals by sending threatening [[psychic]] letters, such as zodiac-services.com, and fake drug companies such as the now-defunct uk-online-pharmacy.com.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Bob ''[http://www.dr-bob.org/babble/20090426/msgs/893015.html]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Advance Fee fraudsters also use Domains By Proxy. On 5 Feb 2016, the Artists Against 419 database reflected 1124 out of 108684 entries abused the services of Domains By Proxy. This represents a figure of slightly over one percent of the entries. &lt;ref&gt;Artists Against 419 Database ''[http://db.aa419.org/fakebankslist.php?psearch=domainsbyproxy.com]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy===
In 2014, Domains by Proxy handed over personal details of a site owner to [[Motion Picture Association]] due to potential copyright infringement despite the website not hosting any copyrighted files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/domains-proxy-hands-personal-details-pirate-site-owner-140307/ |title=‘Domains by Proxy’ Hands Over Personal Details of “Pirate” Site Owner |date=6 March 2014 |publisher=TorrentFreak |accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''G.E.E. Lindquist Native American Photographs Collection''' is an online presentation of the 1322 photographs, 124 postcards, 388 negatives, and 34 glass plate negatives/lantern slides, which derive from the G.E.E. Lindquist Papers archival collection at The Burke Library at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]], Columbia University in the City of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindquist|first=Gustavus E.E.|title=Lindquist Native American Photographs|url=http://lindquist.cul.columbia.edu/|publisher=Columbia University Libraries|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They depict the people, places, and practices of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and their communities from at least 34 States, plus Canada and Mexico in the period from 1909-1953. The majority of the images were taken by G. E. E. Lindquist (1886-1967), an itinerant representative of the ecumenical Home Missions Council of the [[Federal Council of Churches]].

== About the Collection ==

Sourced from Lindquist's archival papers, the Lindquist online image collection depicts the people, places, and practices of Native American communities from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. These photographs were taken by Lindquist, an ordained home missions administrator, as he traveled to reservations from 1909 to 1953 as part of his work with the Home Mission Council of the Federal Council of Churches.

Online access is now available to the collection, which includes 1322 photographs, 124 postcards, 388 negatives, and 34 glass plate negatives/lantern slides.

This collection consists of individual and group portraits, landscapes, buildings, agricultural and industrial scenes, cemeteries, parades and pageants, leisure activities, weather events, modes of transportation, and living conditions across a variety of Native communities.

The photographs will be of considerable research value to scholars and researchers exploring topics in 20th Native American history, [[anthropology]], Christian missions, architecture, photography, and the trans-Mississippi West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tonkiss Cameron|first=Ruth|title=Lindquist Native American Photographs|url=http://library.columbia.edu/news/libraries/2012/20120823_lindquist.html/|publisher=Columbia University Libraries|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16804">'''GOST 7.67''' or '''[[ISO 3166]]-88''' is [[GOST]] standard for [[country code]]s.

The standard defines country names in [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[English language]], [[Cyrillic]] three-letter country codes, [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] three- and two-letter country codes, as well as numeric country codes. The latter three are the same as [[ISO 3166]] codes (though, in practice, differences can arise due to changes in ISO 3166 that are still not introduced in GOST 7.67, for example three-letter code for [[Romania]] ROM, which is changed to ROU).

The '''German student movement''' (also called '''68er-Bewegung''', '''movement of 1968''', or '''soixante-huitards''') was a [[protest]] movement that took place during the late 1960s in [[West Germany]]. It was largely a reaction against the perceived [[authoritarianism]] and hypocrisy of the West German government and other Western governments, and the poor living conditions of [[student]]s. A wave of protests—some violent—swept West Germany, fueled by violent over-reaction by the police and encouraged by contemporary protest movements across the world. Following more than a century of [[conservatism]] among German students, the German student movement also marked a significant major shift to the [[left wing|left]] and radicalization of [[student activism]].

== Early stages of the movement ==
In 1966, for the first time in fifteen years, the German economy went into a slight recession and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] finally withdrew from the [[Second Erhard cabinet]] ([[Ludwig Erhard|Ludwig Erhard's]] [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]/FDP coalition government) in late October 1966. With the forming of the CDU/CSU/[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] coalition government under [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] (the first [[Grand coalition]]), the FDP (having 50 of 518 Bundestag seats) was the only voice of the opposition within the [[Bundestag]]. This led some students to conclude that this encouraged [[authoritarian]] and [[Anti-democratic thought|anti-democratic]] attitudes in government and therefore justified and indeed necessitated the transfer of opposition from parliament to bodies outside it (→ [[Außerparlamentarische Opposition]]). At the same time, the shock of realizing that the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' could not last forever led many in the student body, influenced by [[Marxism|Marxist]] economic theory, to believe that the economic wealth of the nation, instead of improving the [[standard of living]] of the [[working class]], would destroy it and lead to an ever-growing gap between the [[wealth|rich]] and the [[Poverty|poor]].

Through their critical work on many different topics and the reactions of the public and the government itself, these main goals formed in the minds of the students:

*Changing society for more [[democracy]].
*Dealing with Germany's and their parents' [[National Socialist]] past ([[Vergangenheitsbewältigung]]) 
*Reforming the curriculum.
*Stopping the [[war in Vietnam]] and improving the conditions in the [[Third World]].
*Reducing the influence of the [[right-wing]] press (especially publications from the [[Axel Springer]] publishing house) on the masses and its abuse of the [[freedom of press]].
*Stopping the planned [[German Emergency Acts|German emergency legislation]] (''Notstandsgesetze'') from being passed.

The first goal may have been the source of all the others and thus the most important in their minds.

To summarize, the students rejected traditional, parliamentary decision making-processes, [[social injustice]] and the inequalities of wealth. They felt the need to overcome and change these things.

== The past ==
To the students, the German chapter of Fascism was not yet closed. Many former National Socialists were still working for the government or at the universities (in fact, then-Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] had formerly been a member of the NSDAP) and the newly formed right-wing [[National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD)|National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD) was attracting more and more voters. In addition to that, the students had to deal with the fact that they were identified as Germans and blamed for the crimes committed by their parents' generation.

The students did not want to be held responsible for their parents' deeds. But their parents acted as if it were no concern of theirs; when the students tried to show the public that the anti-fascist idea of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|constitution]] was not yet established in German society, the government and the press felt extremely offended, feeling they had formed a democratic society and did not want it to be attacked.

== Students and universities ==
To support its new economic policies the government wanted to change the universities, producing graduates faster by introducing a time limit on courses and limiting the number of students. The students, however, did not want to adjust to the needs of the economy and the government. Rather, they wanted to adjust the universities to their own principles. They wanted more rights in the running of universities, better-equipped workplaces and the expulsion of the professors who had been active during the Third Reich. The university boards did not react to the students' protest and introduced the time limit for studying.

When this time limit was introduced at the [[Free University of Berlin]] during the summer holidays of 1966 the students were not there, and so were unable to protest against it; instead, the first big [[sit-in]] of the German student movement happened when they returned after the holidays, with about 4,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=891&lt;/ref&gt; The events at the Free University of Berlin are representative of the events at all universities in Germany, as the same events were quickly repeated elsewhere.

== The war in Vietnam and political suppression ==
Through their increasing interest in politics the students quickly engaged in discussions concerning the war in Vietnam. They formed the opinion that the [[United States]] had no right to fight in [[Vietnam]], not only because of the victims but mainly because of what they saw as an [[imperialism|imperialistic]] foreign policy.

The government, however, supported the USA in the [[Vietnam War]], and provided humanitarian and economic support to [[South Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/allied/ch07.htm#b4 CHAPTER VII Nonmilitary Aid to Vietnam&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, university boards put a ban on political activities by students (''e.g.'', discussions) at the universities. They explained this act by saying that science should always be neutral. The students wanted to be able to act politically, not only because of the war in Vietnam, but to protest against the conditions in the [[Third World]] as students and not only as individuals.

==Emergency Acts==
The students were strongly opposed to the [[German Emergency Acts]] which were due to be passed, which would allow the government to limit civil rights in the case of an emergency. Among other things, they would allow the government to restrict [[freedom of movement]] and to limit privacy and confidentiality of telecommunications correspondence.

== Action and reaction ==

By 1966 the number of students that were interested in the conflict between the students and the authorities had increased. Many of those who had not been interested before became at least passively interested by now. This newly formed public took part in the demonstrations, sit-ins and other protest actions arranged by the students and their organizations, ''e.g.'', the [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund]] (SDS).

The government tried to defuse the situation by decreasing the funds for universities and student organizations and by turning public opinion against the students with the help of the press. The view that students should study and not demonstrate grew stronger. The students were also repressed in the streets by the police. Yet, the more pressure the government put on the students, the more they came together.

On 2 June 1967 the conflict would finally escalate. Students had organized demonstrations against the official visit by the [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]]. In their opinion, the German government was demonstrating a positive attitude towards a [[dictatorship|dictatorial]] government that was suppressing and torturing its own people.

During the first demonstration in front of the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin|Opera House]], which the Shah was visiting, the police of [[Berlin]] and the [[Iran]]ian service attacked the protestors. In the turmoil, the unarmed student [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head from behind and killed by Polizeiobermeister (Police Sergeant) [[Karl-Heinz Kurras]] (in fact, Karl-Heinz Kurras was an agent of the [[East German]] secret service, the [[Stasi]]).

The following days saw many demonstrations throughout the whole republic against what was perceived as [[police brutality]]. The students in Berlin, however, were anxious and in a desperate situation. The police were preventing them from gathering in public, the universities had submitted their authority to the government and the press wrote that the students were the brutal and aggressive component of the demonstrations and that they had provoked the death of Benno Ohnesorg. Even though there were some students groups supporting the idea of a violent revolution the protesting students were mostly peaceful.

For the following days the students took over control of the Free University of Berlin. Finally being able to meet again, they used the time to discuss and reflect on the events of the past days.

== The revolt continues ==
The spirit of the students in Berlin spread across the whole country. In autumn 1967 there were organized protest groups at nearly all universities in Germany. In the following months some of the largest and most brutal demonstrations in the history of the German republic happened. The press, especially the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'' newspaper was telling the public what to think about those protesters{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. Its publisher, Axel Springer, did not publish any positive articles about the students. Springer supported the government and was spreading the government's views among its readers{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

At [[Easter]] 1968, there was an attempted assassination of one of the most important members of the [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|SDS]], [[Rudi Dutschke]]. The students were outraged because the "Springer" press and the government had named Rudi Dutschke their "public enemy". Overnight students all over Germany organized actions to block the delivery of the ''Bild-Zeitung'' by building blockades and protesting in front of "Springer" buildings. During these actions about 400 students were injured and two died. Rudi Dutschke died in 1979 of the late after-effects of his injury.

== The climax and the decline ==
The revolt against the government reached its climax in May 1968. Students, schoolchildren and members of workers' unions formed a group of 80,000 people who demonstrated in the capital [[Bonn]] against the emergency legislature. Even though the students mobilized as many people as possible to support their actions they could not stop the [[Bundestag]] from passing the new law.

This failure marks the beginning of the end for the student movement. The former union of many small student groups representing different theories on the same topics was falling apart because they were blaming other groups' theories and thinking for the failure of the whole movement. By the end of the year even the SDS, the strongest of all student organizations, was falling into pieces.

== Effects ==
Through their political work women came to the conclusion that they were being suppressed by a patriarchal society, and that they had to change this condition. In addition to that the student movement brought up many theories on education and the raising of children which have influenced the modern forms of these processes. These changes and the huge influence on culture and art were probably the most important effects of the student movement.

An indirect effect was the "[[Berufsverbot|radical decree]]" which was passed in 1972.  It allowed the government to prevent the employment of people in the public services if there were grounds to believe that they did not support the free and democratic principles (freiheitliche demokratische Grundordnung) outlined in the constitution (Grundgesetz). Under the decree, which gradually fell into disuse after 1976, around 3.5 million individuals were investigated and 10,000 refused employment (fewer than 0.3%); 130 were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Source of figures: http://www.dhm.de/ausstellungen/grundrechte/katalog/144-149.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of ministers in the [[Gerhard Schröder]] government were student activists in the 1960s and early 1970s.

They cover a wide range of uses, from functional modeling to data, simulation, object-oriented analysis/design and knowledge acquisition. These "definition languages" were developed under funding from [[U.S. Air Force]] and although still most commonly used by them, as well as other military and [[United States Department of Defense|United States Department of Defense (DoD)]] agencies, are in the [[public domain]].

The most-widely recognized and used components of the IDEF family are [[IDEF0]], a [[functional model]]ing language building on [[Structured Analysis and Design Technique|SADT]], and [[IDEF1X]], which addresses [[Data model|information models]] and [[database design]] issues.

== Overview of IDEF methods ==
IDEF refers to a family of [[modeling language]], which cover a wide range of uses, from functional modeling to data, simulation, object-oriented analysis/design and knowledge acquisition. Eventually the IDEF methods have been defined up to IDEF14:  
* [[IDEF0]] : Function modeling&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idef.com/IDEF0.htm IDEFØ Overview] at idef.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[IDEF1X#History|IDEF1]] : Information modeling &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idef.com/IDEF1.htm IDEF1 Overview] at idef.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[IDEF1X]] : Data modeling &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idef.com/IDEF1x.htm IDEF1x Overview] at idef.com&lt;/ref&gt;

* IDEF10 : Implementation architecture modeling
* IDEF11 : Information artifact modeling
* IDEF12 : Organization modeling
* IDEF13 : Three schema mapping design
* [[IDEF14]] : Network design

In 1995 only the [[IDEF0]], [[IDEF1X]], [[IDEF2]], [[IDEF3]] and [[IDEF4]] had been developed in full.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Hanrahan [http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/crosstalk/1995/06/IDEF.asp The IDEF Process Modeling Methodology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126094915/http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/crosstalk/1995/06/IDEF.asp |date=2007-01-26 }}. Software Technology Support Center. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other IDEF concepts had some preliminary design. Some of the last efforts were new IDEF developments in 1995 toward establishing reliable methods for business constraint discovery [[IDEF9]], design rationale capture [[IDEF6]], human system, interaction design [[IDEF8]], and network design [[IDEF14]].&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt; 

The methods IDEF7, IDEF10, IDEF11, IDEF 12 and IDEF13 haven't been developed any further than their initial definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/enterprise-solutions/idef-standards-overview-18730 Observations from a Tech Architect: Enterprise Implementation Issues &amp; Solutions] Craig Borysowich. Accessed 20 Jan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
IDEF originally stood for ''[[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing|ICAM]] Definition'', initiated in the 1970s at the US Air Force Materials Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio by [[Dennis E. Wisnosky]], Dan L. Shunk and others.&lt;ref name="Sav96"&gt;Charles M. Savage (1996). ''Fifth Generation Management : Co-creating Through Virtual Enterprising, Dynamic Teaming, and Knowledge Networking'' Butterworth-Heinemann, 1996. {{ISBN|0-7506-9701-6}}. p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and completed in the 1980s. IDEF was a product of the [[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing]] (ICAM) initiative of the [[United States Air Force]]. The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] recast the IDEF abbreviation as "Integration DEFinition."&lt;ref name="IEEE IDEF Ref"/&gt;

The specific projects that produced IDEF were ICAM project priorities 111 and 112 (later renumbered 1102). The subsequent Integrated Information Support System (IISS) project priorities 6201, 6202, and 6203 attempted to create an [[information processing]] environment that could be run in [[heterogeneous]] physical computing environments. Further development of IDEF occurred under those projects as a result of the experience gained from applications of the new modeling techniques. The intent of the IISS efforts was to create 'generic subsystems' that could be used by a large number of collaborating enterprises, such as U.S. [[defense contractor]]s and the armed forces of friendly nations.

At the time of the ICAM 1102 effort there were numerous, mostly incompatible, [[data model]] methods for storing computer data &amp;mdash; [[Sequential access|sequential]] ([[VSAM]]), [[Hierarchical model|hierarchical]] ([[Information Management System|IMS]]), [[Network model|network]] ([[Cincom]]'s TOTAL and [[CODASYL]], and [[Cullinet]]'s [[IDMS]]). The [[relational data model]] was just emerging as a promising way of thinking about structuring data for easy, efficient, and accurate access. [[Relational database management system|Relational database management systems]] had not yet emerged as a general standard for data management.

The ICAM program office deemed it valuable to create a "neutral" way of describing the data content of large-scale systems. The emerging academic literature suggested that methods were needed to process [[Data independence|data independently]] of the way it was [[data structure|physically stored]]. Thus the IDEF1 language was created to allow a neutral description of data structures that could be applied regardless of the storage method or file access method.

IDEF1 was developed under ICAM program priority 1102 by Dr Robert R. Brown of the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]], under contract to [[SofTech, Inc.]] Dr Brown had previously been responsible for the development of [[Information Management System|IMS]] while working at [[Rockwell International]]. Rockwell chose not to pursue IMS as a marketable product but [[International Business Machines|IBM]], which had served as a support contractor during development, subsequently took over the product and was successful in further developing it for market. Dr Brown credits his Hughes' colleague Mr Timothy Ramey as the inventor of IDEF1 as a viable formalism for modeling information structures. The two Hughes' researchers built on ideas from and interactions with many luminaries in the field at the time. In particular, IDEF1 draws on the following techniques:
* the evolving natural language information model ([[NIAM|ENALIM]]) technique of [[G. M. Nijssen|Dr G. M. Nijssen]] ([[Control Data Corporation]]) — this technique is now more widely known as [[NIAM]] or the object-role model [[Object-role modeling|ORM]];
* the network data structures technique, popularly called the [[CODASYL]] approach, of [[Charles Bachman|Dr Charles Bachman]] ([[Honeywell Information Systems]]);
* the hierarchical data management technique, implemented in IBM's IMS data management system, developed by [[R. R. Brown|Dr R. R. Brown]] ([[Rockwell International]]);
* the relational approach to data of [[E. F. Codd|Dr E. F. Codd]] ([[IBM]]);
* The [[entity-relationship model|entity-relationship approach]] (E-R) of [[Peter Chen|Dr Peter Chen]] ([[UCLA]]).
The effort to develop IDEF1 resulted in both a new method for information modeling and an example of its use in the form of a "reference information model of manufacturing." This latter artifact was developed by D. S. Coleman of the D. Appleton Company (DACOM) acting as a sub-contractor to Hughes and under the direction of Mr Ramey. Personnel at DACOM became quite expert at IDEF1 modeling and subsequently produced a training course and accompanying materials for the IDEF1 modeling technique.

Experience with IDEF1 revealed that the translation of ''information requirements'' into ''database designs'' was more difficult than had originally been anticipated. The most beneficial value of the IDEF1 information modeling technique was its ability to represent data independent of how those data were to be stored and used. It provided data modelers and data analysts with a way to represent ''data requirements'' during the requirements-gathering process. This allowed designers to decide which DBMS to use after the nature of the data requirements was understood and thus reduced the "misfit" between data requirements and the capabilities and limitations of the DBMS. The translation of IDEF1 models to database designs, however, proved to be difficult.

== The IDEF modeling languages ==

=== IDEF0 ===
{{main|IDEF0}}
[[Image:IDEF Diagram Example.jpg|280px|thumb|Example of an [[IDEF0]] diagram: a [[function model]] of the process of maintaining reparable spares]]

The IDEF0 functional modeling method is designed to model the decisions, actions, and activities of an organization or system.&lt;ref name = "VG00"&gt;Varun Grover, William J. Kettinger (2000). ''Process Think: Winning Perspectives for Business Change in the Information Age. p.168.&lt;/ref&gt; It was derived from the established graphic modeling language [[Structured Analysis and Design Technique|structured analysis and design technique]] (SADT) developed by [[Douglas T. Ross]] and [[SofTech, Inc.]]. In its original form, IDEF0 includes both a definition of a graphical modeling language ([[syntax]] and [[semantics]]) and a description of a comprehensive methodology for developing models.&lt;ref name= "ITL93"&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/idef02.doc FIPS Publication 183] released of IDEFØ December 1993 by the Computer Systems Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&lt;/ref&gt; The US Air Force commissioned the SADT developers to develop a [[function model]] method for analyzing and communicating the functional perspective of a system. IDEF0 should assist in organizing system analysis and promote effective communication between the analyst and the customer through simplified graphical devices.&lt;ref name = "VG00"/&gt;

=== IDEF1X ===
{{main|IDEF1X}}
[[Image:B 5 1 IDEF1X Diagram.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Example of an [[IDEF1X]] diagram]]

To satisfy the [[data modeling]] enhancement requirements that were identified in the IISS-6202 project, a sub-contractor, [[DACOM]], obtained a license to the [[logical database design technique]] (LDDT) and its supporting software (ADAM). LDDT had been developed in 1982 by Robert G. Brown of The Database Design Group entirely outside the IDEF program and with no knowledge of IDEF1. LDDT combined elements of the relational data model, the E-R model, and generalization in a way specifically intended to support data modeling and the transformation of the data models into database designs. The graphic syntax of LDDT differed from that of IDEF1 and, more importantly, LDDT contained interrelated modeling concepts not present in IDEF1. Mary E. Loomis wrote a concise summary of the syntax and semantics of a substantial subset of LDDT, using terminology compatible with IDEF1 wherever possible. DACOM labeled the result [[IDEF1X]] and supplied it to the ICAM program.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE (1998). ''IEEE Std 1320.2-1998. IEEE Standard for Conceptual Modeling Language Syntax and Semantics for IDEF1X''. New York. p. iii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Thomas A. (1992), Designing Quality Databases with IDEF1X Information Models, {{ISBN|0-932633-18-8}} p=xii&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because the IDEF program was funded by the government, the techniques are in the [[public domain]]. In addition to the ADAM software, sold by DACOM under the name Leverage, a number of [[Computer-aided software engineering|CASE]] tools use [[IDEF1X]] as their representation technique for data modeling. 

The IISS projects actually produced working prototypes of an information processing environment that would run in heterogeneous computing environments. Current advancements in such techniques as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[JDBC]] are now achieving the goals of ubiquity and versatility across computing environments which was first demonstrated by IISS.

The third IDEF (IDEF2) was originally intended as a user interface modeling method. However, since the [[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing]] (ICAM) program needed a simulation modeling tool, the resulting IDEF2 was a method for representing the time varying behavior of resources in a manufacturing system, providing a framework for specification of math model based simulations. It was the intent of the methodology program within [[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing|ICAM]] to rectify this situation but limitation of funding did not allow this to happen. As a result, the lack of a method which would support the structuring of descriptions of the [[user view]] of a system has been a major shortcoming of the IDEF system. The basic problem from a methodology point of view is the need to distinguish between a description of what a system (existing or proposed) is supposed to do and a representative simulation model that will predict what a system will do. The latter was the focus of [[IDEF2]], the former is the focus of [[IDEF3]].&lt;ref name="FB89"&gt;Patricia Griffith Friel and Thomas M. Blinn (1989).

NASA Johnson Space Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IDEF4 ===
{{main|IDEF4}}
[[File:118 The Behavior Diagram for methods Implementing Louder.jpg|thumb|left|210px|[[IDEF4]] behavior diagram]]

The development of [[IDEF4]] came from the recognition that the modularity, maintainability and code reusability that results from the [[object-oriented programming]] paradigm can be realized in traditional [[data processing]] applications. The proven ability of the object-oriented programming paradigm to support data level integration in large complex [[distributed system]]s is also a major factor in the widespread interest in this technology from the traditional data processing community.&lt;ref name="FB89"/&gt;

[[IDEF4]] was developed as a design tool for software designers who use object-oriented languages such as the [[Common Lisp Object System]], [[Flavors (programming language)|Flavors]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Objective-C]], [[C++]], and others. Since effective usage of the object-oriented paradigm requires a different thought process than used with conventional procedural or [[database language]]s, standard methodologies such as [[structure chart]]s, [[data flow diagram]]s, and traditional [[database model|data design model]]s (hierarchical, relational, and network) are not sufficient. IDEF4 seeks to provide the necessary facilities to support the object-oriented design decision making process.&lt;ref name="FB89"/&gt;

=== IDEF5 ===

[[Image:4-54 Composition Schematic for Ballpoint.jpg|thumb|240px|Example of an [[IDEF5]] composition schematic for a ballpoint pen]]

[[IDEF5]], or ''integrated definition for ontology description capture method'', is a software engineering method to develop and maintain usable, accurate, domain [[ontology (computer science)|ontologies]].&lt;ref name="PCB94"&gt;Perakath C. Benjamin et al. (1994). [http://www.idef.com/pdf/Idef5.pdf ''IDEF5 Method Report'']. Knowledge Based Systems, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of computer science ontologies are used to capture the [[concept and object]]s in a specific [[Domain analysis|domain]], along with associated relationships and meanings. In addition, ontology capture helps coordinate projects by standardizing [[terminology]] and creates opportunities for [[information]] reuse. The IDEF5 Ontology Capture Method has been developed to reliably construct ontologies in a way that closely reflects human [[understanding]] of the specific domain.&lt;ref name="PCB94"/&gt;

In the IDEF5 method, an ontology is constructed by capturing the content of certain assertions about real-world objects, their properties and their interrelationships, and representing that content in an intuitive and natural form. The IDEF5 method has three main components: A graphical language to support conceptual ontology analysis, a structured text language for detailed ontology characterization, and a systematic procedure that provides guidelines for effective ontology capture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Varun Grover, William J. Kettinger (2000). ''Process Think: Winning Perspectives for Business Change in the Information Age. p.176-178&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IDEF6 ===
{{main|IDEF6}}
[[File:IIDEF4 Design Activities.jpg|thumb|210px|left|IDEF6 model of IDEF4 design activities]]

[[IDEF6]], or ''integrated definition for design rationale capture'', is a method to facilitate the acquisition, representation, and manipulation of the [[design rationale]] used in the development of [[enterprise systems]]. Rationale is the reason, justification, underlying motivation, or excuse that moved the designer to select a particular strategy or design feature. More simply, rationale is interpreted as the answer to the question, “Why is this design being done in this manner?” Most design methods focus on what the design is (i.e. on the final product, rather than why the design is the way it is).&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt; 

IDEF6 will be a method that possesses the conceptual resources and linguistic capabilities needed
# to represent the nature and structure of the information that constitutes design rationale within a given system, and
# to associate that rationale with design specifications, models, and documentation for the system.
IDEF6 is applicable to all phases of the information system development process, from initial conceptualization through both preliminary and detailed design activities. To the extent that detailed design decisions for software systems are relegated to the coding phase, the IDEF6 technique should be usable during the software construction process as well.&lt;ref name= "MGM90"&gt;[[Richard J. Mayer|Mayer, Richard J.]] ; Griffith, Patricia A. ; Menzel, Christopher P. (1990-91) [http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA261594 "IDEF6: A Design Rationale Capture Method Concept Paper"] Defense Technical Information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IDEF8 ===
IDEF8, or ''integrated definition for human-system interaction design'', is a method for producing high-quality designs of interactions between users and the systems they operate. Systems are characterized as a collection of objects that perform functions to accomplish a particular goal. The system with which the user interacts can be any system, not necessarily a computer program. Human-system interactions are designed at three levels of specification within the IDEF8 method. The first level defines the philosophy of system operation and produces a set of models and textual descriptions of overall system processes. The second level of design specifies role-centered scenarios of system use. The third level of IDEF8 design is for human-system design detailing. At this level of design, IDEF8 provides a library of metaphors to help users and designers specify the desired behavior in terms of other objects whose behavior is more familiar. Metaphors provide a model of abstract concepts in terms of familiar, concrete objects and experiences.&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt;

=== IDEF9 ===
[[File:Typical business systems.jpg|thumb|320px|Typical business systems]]

IDEF9, or ''integrated definition for business constraint discovery'', is designed to assist in the discovery and analysis of constraints in a [[business system]]. A primary motivation driving the development of IDEF9 was an acknowledgment that the collection of constraints that forge an enterprise system is generally poorly defined. The knowledge of what constraints exist and how those constraints interact is incomplete, disjoint, distributed, and often completely unknown. This situation is not necessarily alarming. Just as living organisms do not need to be aware of the genetic or autonomous constraints that govern certain behaviors, organizations can (and most do) perform well without explicit knowledge of the glue that structures the system. In order to modify business in a predictable manner, however, the knowledge of these constraints is as critical as knowledge of genetics is to the genetic engineer.&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt;

=== IDEF14 ===
IDEF14, or ''integrated definition for network design method'', is a method that targets the modeling and design of [[computer network|computer]] and [[communication network]]s. It can be used to model existing ("as is") or envisioned ("to be") networks. It helps the network designer to investigate potential network designs and to document design rationale. The fundamental goals of the IDEF14 research project developed from a perceived need for good network designs that can be implemented quickly and accurately.&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt;

''Daily Herald''. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; His work has been exhibited in America, as well as in Germany and in France.&lt;ref name=Yochim/&gt;

==Biography==

Walker was born in Kirksville, Missouri, to James Franklin Walker Sr. and Mable Azalea Hunt. Walker's father was a landscape artist and an early influence,&lt;ref name=Yochim/&gt; and his brother is also an artist. Walker's passion for art evolved over his lifetime into a career as artist and teacher.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; He studied at the University of Iowa in Iowa City receiving a BFA. He then moved to New York City, where he studied at the [[American Artists School]] and at the studio of Nahum Tschacbasov.&lt;ref name=Yochim/&gt; His work was influenced by Tschacbasov's surrealist images.&lt;ref name=Algonquin&gt;{{cite news |title=Interesting Personalities Who Live in the Valley |newspaper=Algonquin Life |date=April 22, 1959 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker joined the army in 1941, serving in the Aleutian Islands until 1945. During the war, he married Leona Buchanan. They had one child, Joy Walker Hall.&lt;ref name=Algonquin/&gt; After World War II, he returned to the University of Iowa for an MA in art history and an MFA in studio printmaking.&lt;ref name=Yochim/&gt; At that time, he studied under [[Mauricio Lasansky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NMSU Presenting Art Exhibit of Three Generations |newspaper=Kirksville Daily Express and News |date=September 9, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered "one of the fathers of twentieth-century American printmaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |publisher=School of Art and Art History, University of Iowa |url=http://www.art.uiowa.edu/about/history |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasansky had brought his printmaking skills and techniques from [[Stanley William Hayter]]'s New York Atelier 17 to the University of Iowa School of Art and History (1945–1986). "If there is such a thing as a printmaking capital of the U.S., it could well be the Department of Graphic Arts at the State University of Iowa in Iowa City."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Art: Iowa's Printmaker |magazine=Time |date=December 1, 1961 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938829,00.html |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an interval teaching art in Kansas, Walker took a teaching position at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (1954–1959).&lt;ref name=Yochim/&gt; While at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, ''Art in America'' twice named him to the 100 Best New Talent List, 1956 and 1959.&lt;ref name=America/&gt;&lt;ref name=America2/&gt;

Many years later, Santa Fe artist Lorraine Dickinson remembered her time in Walker's drawing and collage classes at the School of the Art Institute. Her work was "all in the representational mode," she said. "I didn't get into abstract until I studied with James F. Walker in Chicago. He was determined that we were all going to stop painting traditionally. It was like pulling teeth but I finally got it. A few times I tried to revert back to representational, but I get so bored with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weideman |first=Paul |title=Opening the Door to the Ultimate Human Space |newspaper=The Sante Fe New Mexican |date=March 26, 1999 |page=Pasatiempo section, p 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Walker accepted a teaching position at Arlington High School and later at Elk Grove High School, both in Northwest Suburban High School District 214.&lt;ref name=Yochim/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; When interviewed by the Arlington High School newspaper, ''The Cardinal'', Walker explained his philosophy of education: "The art department isn't run especially for the talented student, but rather to enrich the cultural background for all students."&lt;ref&gt;''The Cardinal''. October 21, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from teaching in 1975&lt;ref name=Yochim/&gt; and moved with his family to Gravette, Arkansas, where he continued to work as an artist until his death in 1994.&lt;ref name=Schmitt/&gt;

Richard Calisch, division head of English and Fine Arts at Elk Grove High School said, "[Walker] was that special combination who had his own career and was also a fine teacher. The kids loved him."&lt;ref name=Schmitt/&gt;

==Work==

Walker's work builds on the legacy of his teacher, Mauricio Lasansky. Walker combines a spectrum of Lasansky's graphic techniques, including collage, monoprints, aquatint, pencil, brush, rubbings, etchings, and silkscreen. All combinations of these techniques appear in Walker's work.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;

In a statement to the [[Chicago Society of Artists]], Walker described his own work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My paintings project my intense concern for, and interest in, the nature of texture surfaces within the context of meticulously rendered forms, revealing the essence of Magic Realism, a microscopic view of every infinitesimal area upon the canvas.&lt;ref name=Yochim/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As he said to a reporter from ''Algonquin Life'', an Algonquin, Illinois, community newspaper,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A good artist paints what he sees, lives, thinks, and feels, although his finished product may not have the slightest congruency to what the ordinary person visualizes. In other words, he doesn't invent pictures—he portrays impressions—again, by what he sees, how he thinks, how he feels. The mistake that a young art student continues to make is this example: the country boy treks to the big city to attend art school. He decides that now he must paint with sophistication—rejecting all of his past association with country life, the hills, the trees, the farm animals, etc. This is a mistake.&lt;ref name=Algonquin/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Walker's ''L.H. Double O.Q.''===
[[File:L.H.DoubleO.Q.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Walker's painting ''L.H. Double O.Q.'' stirred controversy.]]
Walker is perhaps best known for ''L.H. Double O.Q.,'' often referred to as his ''Eisenhower Mona Lisa'', although Wide World Photos referred to it as "Ike the Enigma." ''L.H. Double O.Q.'' won the Award for Collage, Casein, and Drawing in the 1964 Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago and Vicinity Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barry |first=Edward |title=Winners in Chicago Artists Show Named |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |page=b1, section 2 |date=April 30, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a satirical image of one of America's greatest heroes.&lt;ref name=dailynews&gt;{{cite news |last=Herguth |first=Robert J. |title=They Like Ike, But Oh, That Modern Mona |newspaper=The Chicago Daily News |date=May 25, 1964 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His painting is a reference to Marcel Duchamp's 1919 painting ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]'' In this work, Duchamp simply painted a mustache and beard onto a postcard reproduction of the ''Mona Lisa.'' Walker went further.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;

Walker's painting—probably his most famous and controversial work—caused a media stir. It was a satirical portrait of President Dwight D. Eisenhower in drag with a Mona Lisa smile.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The big hit or most popular outrage, if you prefer—at this year's exhibit is a picture starkly titled, ''L.H. Double O.Q.'' It has the smiling face of President Eisenhower in a Mona Lisa pose, complete with headdress. A pair of false teeth floats in the sky. Somebody's antique hands—not Ike's—are in repose.&lt;ref name=dailynews/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A standalone photo in the ''Chicago Daily Defender'' called it "a 'kooky' portrait of Dwight D. Eisenhower in a Mona Lisa pose…"&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Daily Defender'' (May 4, 1964). p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a caption from UPI Telephotos, Walker "titled it ''L.H. Double O.Q.'' for what was 'no special reason at all.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=We Still Like Ike |newspaper=The Titusville Herald |date=May 5, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wide World Photos and UPI Telephotos broadcast photos of ''L.H. Double O.Q.'' to the world. Opinions on the piece fell roughly into two categories: "I like Ike," or "I don't like Ike."&lt;ref name=dailynews/&gt;

==From the critics==

"I found James Walker's collage, ''Creation of Eve'', particularly good with its curious integration of old objects and new movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weller |first=Allen S. |title=Chicago's No Jury Experiment |journal=Arts |date=May 1957 |volume=31 |issue=8 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==

Walker's works are included in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, Kansas Friends of Art, University of Iowa, and numerous private collections.&lt;ref name=Yochim/&gt; Three pieces by Walker are in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago: ''Pygmalion'' (1950), ''Birds in a Landscape'' (1952), and ''Landscape'' (1961).&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first=Kenan |last=Heise |title=James F.

The '''Kunstgewerbemuseum''', or '''Museum of Decorative Arts''', is an internationally important museum of the [[decorative arts]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], part of the [[Staatliche Museen zu Berlin]] (Berlin State Museums). The collection is split between the Kunstgewerbemuseum building at the [[Kulturforum]] {{nowrap|({{coord|52.5097|13.3674|type:landmark_region:DE|display=inline,title|name=Kunstgewerbemuseum, Kulturforum}})}} and [[Köpenick Palace]] {{nowrap|({{coord|52.4439|13.5728|type:landmark_region:DE|display=inline|name=Kunstgewerbemuseum, Schloss Köpenick}}).}}

==History==
It was founded in 1868 as the ''Deutsches Gewerbe-Museum zu Berlin'', and originally had a [[Kunstgewerbeschule|teaching institute]] as well as a public museum. The collection grew significantly in the 1870s, and it was renamed ''Kunstgewerbemuseum'' in 1879.  In 1881 it relocated into the [[Martin-Gropius-Bau]] – where [[Priam's Treasure]] was also on display for a time – and in 1921 it moved into the [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschloss]].&lt;ref name=zeit&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2009/21/Museumsfuehrer Heute mal Extremitäten] Tobias Timm, ''[[Die Zeit]]'', 31 August 2009. Retrieved 26 September 2010. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Schloss Koepenick Hofseite.jpg|thumb|[[Köpenick Palace|Köpenick palace]] ]]
Parts of the collection were destroyed in World War II,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smb.museum/smb/standorte/index.php?lang=de&amp;p=2&amp;objID=37&amp;n=8 Kunstgewerbemuseum] [[Berlin State Museums]]. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the surviving items were split between [[East Berlin|East]] and [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref name="zeit" /&gt; The Eastern collection moved into Köpenick Palace in 1963, while the Western exhibits moved first into [[Charlottenburg Palace]], then into the new museum building in the Kulturforum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturforum-berlin.com/extrafenster/kunstgewerbemuseum.html Kunstgewerbemuseum] [[Kulturforum]]. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1985, built by [[Rolf Gutbrod]].

==Exhibition==

The Kunstgewerbemuseum displays European (and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]]) decorative arts from all post-classical periods of art history, and features gold, silver, glass and [[enamelware|enamel]] items, [[porcelain]], furniture, [[panelling]], [[tapestry]], costumes, and silks.&lt;ref name=home&gt;[http://www.smb.spk-berlin.de/smb/sammlungen/details.php?lang=en&amp;objID=7 Museum of Decorative Arts] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Gropius Bau Berlin 1.jpg|thumb|The north wing of the former Kunstgewerbemuseum (today [[Martin-Gropius-Bau]]), which for many years accommodated the Unterrichtsanstalt des Kunstgewerbemuseums Berlin ("teaching institute")]]There is a very important collection of [[Late Antique]] objects in many media. The items from the [[Middle Ages]] include a large number of gold [[Reliquary|reliquaries]]. The [[Renaissance]] is represented by silverware from the city councillors of [[Lüneburg]], and [[bronze sculpture]]s, tapestries, furniture, [[Venetian glass]]es and [[maiolica]]s from the Italian princely courts.&lt;ref name="home" /&gt;

The [[Baroque]] era is represented by [[faience]]s from [[Delft]], and glass items. There is also European porcelain (particularly from [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen]] and the Royal Manufacturer of Berlin), and decorative crockery from the [[rococo]], [[Classicism|classicist]], [[Historicism|historicist]] and [[Art Nouveau]] styles. The "New Collection" of 20th century craftwork includes industrially-manufactured products.&lt;ref name="home" /&gt;

'''Lancichinetti–Fortunato–Radicchi (LFR)''' '''benchmark''' is an algorithm that generates [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] networks (artificial networks that resemble real-world networks). They have ''a priori'' known [[Community structure|communities]] and are used to compare different community detection methods.&lt;ref&gt;Hua-Wei Shen (2013). "Community Structure of Complex Networks". Springer Science &amp; Business Media. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The advantage of LFR over other methods is that it accounts for the [[Homogeneity (statistics)|heterogeneity]] in the distributions of [[Vertex (graph theory)|node]] [[Degree (graph theory)|degrees]] and of community sizes.&lt;ref name="original"&gt;A. Lancichinetti, S. Fortunato, and F. Radicchi.(2008) Benchmark graphs for testing community detection algorithms. Physical Review E, 78. https://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.4770v4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==The algorithm==
The node degrees and the community sizes are distributed according to a [[power law]], with different exponents. LFR assumes that both the degree and the community size have [[Power law distribution|power law distributions]] with different exponents, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of nodes and the average degree is &lt;math&gt;\langle k \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. There is a mixing parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, which is the average fraction of neighboring nodes of a node that do not belong to any community that the benchmark node belongs to.  This parameter controls the fraction of edges that are between communities.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt; Thus, it reflects the amount of noise in the network. At the extremes, when &lt;math&gt;\mu = 0&lt;/math&gt; all links are within community links, if &lt;math&gt; \mu = 1 &lt;/math&gt; all links are between nodes belonging to different communities.&lt;ref&gt;Twan van Laarhoven and Elena Marchiori (2013). "Network community detection with edge classifiers trained on LFR graphs". http://www.cs.ru.nl/~elenam/paper-learning-community.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One can generate a LFR benchmark network in the following steps.

&lt;big&gt;'''Step 1:'''&lt;/big&gt; Generate a network with nodes following a power law distribution with exponent &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and choose extremes of the distribution &lt;math&gt; k_{\min} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; k_{\max} &lt;/math&gt; to get desired average degree is &lt;math&gt;\langle k\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;big&gt;'''Step 2:'''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;(1 - \mu)&lt;/math&gt; fraction of links of every node is with nodes of the same community, while fraction &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is with the other nodes.

&lt;big&gt;'''Step 3:'''&lt;/big&gt; Generate community sizes from a power law distribution with exponent &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. The sum of all sizes must be equal to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. The minimal and maximal community sizes &lt;math&gt; s_{\min} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; s_{\max} &lt;/math&gt; must satisfy the definition of community so that every non-isolated node is in at least in one community:

: &lt;math&gt; s_{\min} &gt; k_{\min} &lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt; s_{\max} &gt; k_{\max} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Step 4:'''&lt;/big&gt; Initially, no nodes are assigned to communities. Then, each node is randomly assigned to a community. As long as the number of neighboring nodes within the community does not exceed the community size a new node is added to the community, otherwise stays out. In the following iterations the “homeless” node is randomly assigned to some community. If that community is complete, i.e. the size is exhausted, a randomly selected node of that community must be unlinked. Stop the iteration when all the communities are complete and all the nodes belong to at least one community.

&lt;big&gt;'''Step 5:'''&lt;/big&gt; Implement rewiring of nodes keeping the same node degrees but only affecting the fraction of internal and external links such that the number of links outside the community for each node is approximately equal to the mixing parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt;

==Testing==
Consider a [[Partition of a set|partition]] into communities that do not overlap. The communities of randomly chosen nodes in each iteration follow a &lt;math&gt;p(C)&lt;/math&gt; distribution that represents the probability that a randomly picked node is from the community &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Consider a partition of the same network that was predicted by some community finding algorithm and has &lt;math&gt;p(C_2)&lt;/math&gt; distribution. The benchmark partition has &lt;math&gt;p(C_1)&lt;/math&gt; distribution.
The joint distribution is &lt;math&gt;p(C_1, C_2)&lt;/math&gt;. The similarity of these two partitions is captured by the normalized [[mutual information]].

: &lt;math&gt; I_n = \frac{\sum_{C_1,C_2} p(C_1,C_2) \log_2 \frac{p(C_1,C_2)}{p(C_1)p(C_2)} }{\frac 1 2 H(\{p(C_1)\}) + \frac 1 2 H(\{p(C_2)\})} &lt;/math&gt;

If  &lt;math&gt; I_n=1 &lt;/math&gt; the benchmark and the detected partitions are identical, and if &lt;math&gt; I_n=0 &lt;/math&gt; then they are independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Barabasi, A.-L. (2014). "Network Science". Chapter 9: Communities.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary}}A '''majority''' is the greater part, or more than half, of the total. It is a [[subset]] of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] consisting of more than half of the set's elements.

"Majority" can be used to specify the voting requirement, as in a "majority vote". A majority vote is more than half of the votes cast.

A majority can be compared to a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], which is a subset larger than any other subset considered. A plurality is not necessarily a majority as the largest subset considered may consist of less than half the set's elements. This can occur when there are three or more possible choices.

In British English the term majority is also alternatively used to refer to the winning margin, i.e., the number of votes separating the first-place finisher from the second-place finisher.

Other related terms containing the word "majority" have their own meanings, which may sometimes be inconsistent in usage.

It is a situation when more than half the members in a group support a decision it is called majority

== Explanation ==
A majority is the greater part, or more than half, of the total.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;See dictionary definitions of "majority" at [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/majority Merriam-Webster], [https://dictionary.reference.com/browse/majority dictionary.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221102100/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/majority |date=2015-12-21 }}, [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/majority Oxford English Dictionary], [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/majority thefreedictionary.com], and [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/majority Cambridge English Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, say a group consists of 20 individuals. In this case, a majority would be 11 or more individuals. For this group, having 10 or fewer individuals would not constitute a majority.

== Majority vote ==
In [[parliamentary procedure]], the term "majority" simply means "more than half."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#4|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 4)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-29|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As it relates to a vote, a majority vote is more than half of the votes cast.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = 400|edition = 11th|ref = harv|quote = The word ''majority'' means "more than half"; and when the term ''majority vote'' is used without qualification—as in the case of the basic requirement—it means more than half of the votes cast by persons entitled to vote, excluding blanks or abstentions, at a regular or properly called meeting.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abstention]]s or blanks are excluded in calculating a majority vote.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#6|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 6)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-29|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the totals do not include votes cast by someone not entitled to vote or improper multiple votes by a single member.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Depending on the [[parliamentary authority]] used, there may be a difference in the total that is used to calculate a majority vote due to "illegal votes". Illegal votes are votes which are cast for unidentifiable or ineligible candidates or choices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this definition, "illegal" refers to the choices made on the ballot and does not refer to the persons who cast the votes (i.e. the persons are eligible to vote).

In [[Robert's Rules of Order|''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'']] (abbreviated RONR), illegal votes are counted as votes cast, but are not credited to any candidate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In ''[[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure]]'' (abbreviated ''TSC''), illegal votes are not included in the total and a majority vote is defined as being more than half of all eligible votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;''The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure'', 4th edition, 2001, pp. 134, 158-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of "illegal votes" does not exist when only two options are possible (e.g. "yes" or "no"), such as when a majority vote is required to adopt a proposal ([[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]]). In this context, a majority vote is more "yes" votes than "no" votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority vote is not the same as a vote of a "[[Majority#"Majority of the members present"|majority of the members present]]" or a vote of a "[[Majority#"Majority of the entire membership" and "majority of the fixed membership"|majority of the entire membership]]".

== Examples ==
For example, assume that votes are cast for three people for an office: Alice, Bob, and Carol.

=== Scenario 1 ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Candidate !! Votes
|-
|Alice || 14
|-
|Bob || 4
|-
|Carol || 2
|-
!Total !! 20
|}
In Scenario 1, Alice received a majority vote. There were 20 votes cast and Alice received more than half of them.

=== Scenario 2 ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Candidate !! Votes
|-
|Alice || 10
|-
|Bob || 6
|-
|Carol || 4
|-
!Total !! 20
|}
In Scenario 2, assume all three candidates are eligible. In this case, no one received a majority vote. This example also illustrates that half the votes cast is not a majority vote.

=== Scenario 3 ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Candidate !! Votes
|-
|Alice || 10
|-
|Bob || 6
|-
|Carol (ineligible) || 4
|-
!Total !! 20
|}
In Scenario 3, assume that Alice and Bob are eligible candidates, but Carol is not. Using ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'', no one received a majority vote, which is the same as Scenario 2. In this case, the 4 votes for Carol are counted in the total, but are not credited to Carol (which precludes the possibility of an ineligible candidate being credited with receiving a majority vote).

However, using ''[[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure|The Standard Code]]'', Alice received a majority vote since only votes for eligible candidates are counted using this book. In this case, there are 16 votes for eligible candidates and Alice received more than half of those 16 votes.

=== Comparison to plurality ===
In all three scenarios, Alice received a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], or the most votes among the candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 404–405}}: "A ''plurality vote'' is the largest number of votes to be given any candidate or proposition when three or more choices are possible; the candidate or proposition receiving the largest number of votes has a plurality."&lt;/ref&gt; However, only in Scenario 1 did Alice receive a majority vote using ''Robert's Rules of Order''.

== Related terms ==
Other related terms containing the word "majority" have their own meanings, which may sometimes be inconsistent in usage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A majority may sometimes be called a "simple majority" to contrast with other terms using "majority".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = International Institutional Law: Unity Within Diversity|last = Schermers|first = Henry G.|publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year = 2011|isbn = 978-90-04-18798-6|location = Leiden, The Netherlands|pages = 561–563|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OMXToQLp21UC&amp;pg=PA562|edition = Fifth Revised|last2 = Blokker|first2 = Niels M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "simple majority" may also mean a "relative majority", or a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]].&lt;ref&gt;See dictionary definition of "simple majority" at [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/simple-majority dictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt; These two definitions would conflict when a "simple majority" (i.e. plurality) is not a "majority" (also see the [[simple majority (disambiguation)|disambiguation page for simple majority]]).

An "[[Majority of the entire membership|absolute majority]]" may mean a majority of ''all'' electors, not just those who voted.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See dictionary definitions of "simple majority", "absolute majority", and "qualified majority" at [http://en.euabc.com/word/833 EUabc.com].&lt;/ref&gt; This usage would be equivalent to a "majority of the entire membership". However, the definition for "absolute majority" is not consistent, as it could also mean the same as "majority" or "simple majority".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See dictionary definition of "absolute majority" at [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/absolute-majority dictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/absolute-majority|title=Definition of absolute majority noun from Cambridge Dictionary Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"With three-cornered contests as common as they now are, we may have occasion to find a convenient single word for what we used to call an ''absolute majority''... In America the word ''majority'' itself has that meaning while a poll greater than that of any other candidate, but less than half the votes cast is called a ''plurality.'' It might be useful to borrow this distinction..." (Fowler, H.W. 1965 ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage'')&lt;/ref&gt; The meanings for "absolute majority" and "simple majority" would have to be determined from the context in which these terms are used.

A "[[supermajority]]", or a "qualified majority", is a specified higher threshold than one half.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A common use of a supermajority is a "[[two-thirds vote]]", which is sometimes referred to as a "two-thirds majority".

In [[parliamentary system]]s, an "overall majority" is the difference of legislators between the government and its opposition.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web
| title= Overall Majority
| url= http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/overall-majority
| work= Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English
| publisher= Longmans
| accessdate=2009-04-26}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term "majority" could be also alternatively used to refer to the winning margin, i.e. the number of votes separating the first-place finisher from the second-place finisher.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A "[[double majority]]" is a voting system which requires a majority of votes according to two separate criteria.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Temporary majority ==
A temporary majority exists when the positions of the members present and voting in a meeting of a deliberative assembly on a subject are not representative of the membership as a whole. Parliamentary procedure contains some provisions designed to protect against a temporary majority violating the rights of absentees. For instance, [[previous notice]] is required to [[rescind, repeal or annul]] or amend something previously adopted by a majority vote; if previous notice has not been given, a two-thirds vote is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 306}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in this and many other cases, previous notice is not required if a majority of the entire membership votes in favor, because that indicates that it is clearly not a temporary majority. Another protection against a decision being made by a temporary majority is the motion to [[reconsider and enter on the minutes]], by which two members can suspend action on a measure until it is called up at a meeting on another day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application in other voting requirements ==
"Majority" could be specified with respect to the voting body.

=== "Majority of the entire membership" and "majority of the fixed membership" ===
A "[[majority of the entire membership]]" means more than half of all the members of a body.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 403}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "[[majority of the fixed membership]]" means more than half of all the seats of a body.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A majority of the entire membership is different from a majority of the fixed membership when there are vacancies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

For example, say a [[Board of directors|board]] has 12 seats. If the board has the maximum number of members, or 12 members, a majority of the entire membership and a majority of the fixed membership would be 7 members. However, if there are two vacancies (so that there are only 10 members on the board), then a majority of the entire membership would be 6 members (more than half of 10), but a majority of the fixed membership would still be 7 members.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== "Majority of the members present" ===
A "majority of the members present" means more than half of the members at the meeting.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If 30 members were at a meeting, a majority of the members present would be 16. In any situation which specifies such a requirement for a vote, an abstention would have the same effect as a "no" vote.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A vote of a "majority of the members present" is not the same as a "majority vote". When unqualified, a "majority vote" is taken to mean more than half of the votes cast.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If 30 members were at a meeting, but only 20 votes were cast, a majority vote would be 11 votes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Erroneous definitions ==
Erroneous definitions of majority include "50% +1" and "51%".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== "50% + 1" ===
For example, say a board has 7 members. A majority would be 4 (more than half of 7). If "50% +1" is used, the number calculated would be 3.5+1, and thus majority may be mistaken as 4.5, and by rounding up, 5.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This confusion would exist for all odd numbers using the erroneous definition of "50%+1".

=== "51%" ===
In another example, say a [[Convention (meeting)|convention]] has 1000 [[delegate]]s. Using the erroneous definition of 51% would result in a majority being mistaken as 510 instead of 501.

The same logic applies for 50.1%, 50.01%, 50.001%, etc.

{{Linguistic typology topics}}

An '''oligoisolating language''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὀλίγος}}, meaning "few" or "little") is any [[language]] using very few [[morpheme]]s which tend towards [[isolating languages|an isolating structure]] of statements. Oligoisolation is almost entirely theoretical and would necessitate long, modifier-heavy sentences.

No natural language has oligoisolating properties; nevertheless it is present in some [[constructed language]]s, such as [[Toki Pona]] and [[aUI (language)|aUI]].

'''Palm Desktop''' is a [[personal information manager]] computer program for [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Mac OS]]/[[Mac OS X]], and can be used alone or in combination with a [[Palm OS]] [[personal digital assistant]].

==Features==
Palm Desktop contains four main modules which correspond to the four main modules of the original [[Palm Pilot]]:

* Contacts, analogous to [[index cards]] in a [[Rolodex]] card file or [[address book]]
* Calendar information as discrete or repeating appointments
* Tasks, sortable by priority, date or category in [[task list]]s
* Notes, for reference materials, memoranda or [[diary|journal]] entries

Palm Desktop ships with all current Palm devices, and it can synchronize with a variety of devices using Palm's HotSync software. It is also available as a free download and can be used as a standalone application on personal computers. The Macintosh version has a much more sophisticated interface and many more options inherited from its history as Claris Organizer, including extensive printing capabilities for mailing labels and printed pages in various sizes of paper organizer.

==History==
The original Macintosh and Windows versions were similar, until [[3Com]] purchased [[Claris Organizer]] (a Mac-only product) from [[Claris]] and rebranded it as Palm Desktop 2. The four modules of Claris Organizer had influenced some of the original Palm developers, who were familiar with it from earlier work on the Macintosh.

Palm Desktop 4.2 for Windows was perhaps the only version of Palm Desktop which was removed from Palm's website. The company removed it because there were problems with its installer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=twizza|title=Palm Updates Windows Palm Desktop|url=http://www.palminfocenter.com/news/8037/palm-updates-windows-palm-desktop/#111475|accessdate=7 March 2017|at=Comment 111475|quote=4.2 was pulled because of installation issues.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=arnstein|title=Palm Desktop 4.2 Rereleased as 4.1.4E|url=http://www.palminfocenter.com/news/8063/palm-desktop-42-rereleased-as-414e/#111653|accessdate=7 March 2017|at=Comment 111653|quote=I tried to install ... 4.2.

After trying to install three times, I discovered that my existing Palm software had become balled up, to the extent that I could no longer hotsync or launch the desktop software.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was replaced by Palm Desktop 4.1.4E, which is identical except for its improved installer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kairer|first1=Ryan|title=Palm Desktop 4.2 Rereleased as 4.1.4E|url=http://www.palminfocenter.com/news/8063/palm-desktop-42-rereleased-as-414e/|accessdate=7 March 2017|quote=Palm has rereleased the Palm Desktop for Windows that was initially billed as version 4.2. It is now called version 4.1.4E. The E denotes that it is meant for devices with the extended PIM applications. This update is identical to Palm Desktop 4.2, with simply a new version number. Palm Support says if you installed the version labeled 4.2, there is no need to install 4.1.4E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synchronizing with [[Palm Pre]]: some external companies made it possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=palm.com|url=http://forums.palm.com/t5/Synergy-webOS/Continue-to-sync-your-Pre-with-Palm-Desktop/m-p/206981|title= Continue to sync your Pre with Palm Desktop - Support Community}}&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last release==
Palm Desktop 6.2.2 for Windows Vista was released around 2008. Users considering an upgrade to Palm Desktop 6.2.2 should know that this version does not support color-coding of events in the calendar application.

===Compatibilities===
Palm Desktop 6.2.2 works with:
* [[Multi-core CPU]]s
* The following Windows versions:
** [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]], [[Windows 10]]  (64-bits systems needs to manually install drivers, see the incompatibilities section)
** [[Windows Vista]] - Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate ([[32-bit Windows|32-bit editions]])
** [[Windows XP Home]] and [[Windows XP Professional|Professional]] (32-bit editions)
** [[Windows Media Center]] 2005

===Incompatibilities===
This version is not compatible with the following:

* Computers featuring multiple CPUs
* [[64-bit Windows|64-bit editions of Windows]] - 64-bit Windows devices were — for a long time — incompatible with USB cable sync, and must use other options such as serial port, infrared, WiFi or Bluetooth to HotSync. (The desktop software itself — either older version 4.1.4E or newest version 6.2.2 — works fine on Windows 7, 8, or 10 as desktop software without a remote device connected.) Since years, ACEECA developed a 64-bit driver for palm/garnet OS, [http://aceeca.com/index.php/downloads available here.]
* [[Windows Server]]
* [[Microsoft Tablet PC]]

==Linux support==
Palm does not provide a version of the software for Linux operating system, nor do they officially support&lt;ref&gt;http://kb.palm.com/wps/portal/kb/common/article/6503_en.html ''Synchronizing with a Linux Desktop'' — a note at the official technical support Web site of Palm.&lt;/ref&gt; the ones developed by third parties such as:

[[File:Gerola.jpg|thumb|right|Giuseppe Gerola]]

'''Photographic archive Gerola''' is preserved by the [[Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti]] at Palazzo Loredan in [[Venice]].

==Archive history==
It is known that the European powers occupied [[Crete]] at the beginning of 1897, declaring its autonomy from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In consideration of the ambiguous situation that had come about on the big Mediterranean island and the rapid deterioration of its historical monuments (threatened by theft and reckless demolitions), in 1898 the Italian Ministry of Education decided to send an archaeological mission to Crete, directed by [[Federico Halbherr]].
A member and future president of the Royal Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, Carlo Francesco Ferraris, suggested to the members that they finance the sending of a delegate to [[Crete]] who could support the Italian mission with the specific task of exploring and illustrating the monuments that can still be found there of Venetian rule, which extended from 1204 to 1669.

In 1899 [[Giuseppe Gerola]] , on the recommendation of Halbherr (also originally from Rovereto),  was appointed by the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti to carry out a study campaign in Crete aimed at recording the monumental and artistic signs of Venetian rule there. The idea was to reproducing the numerous monuments of Venetian rule on the island partly with plaster casts and partly with photographs .
Gerola arrived in Crete on 18 January 1900.

During two and a half years in Crete, (1900 - 1902), Gerola collected a vast quantity of material, then published  over almost 30 years (between 1905 and 1932) in four monumental volumes, which in 1933 won him the ''Mussolini Prize'', awarded by the [[Royal Academy of Italy]].

==Documentation produced==
Gerola wrote five reports for the Istituto, made more than 50 plaster casts (most of which are in storage at the [[Museo Storico Navale]]), took 1500 photographs, whose negatives are held at the Istituto Veneto, and made a large number of sketches, drawings and notes &lt;ref&gt;A. S. Curuni and L. Donati, ''Creta veneziana. L'Istituto Veneto e la Missione Cretese di Giuseppe Gerola. Collezione fotografica 1900-1902'', Venice 1988, p. 459&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection consists of:
*1642 photographic plates
*1642 negatives 
*1642 photographic reproductions
*1000 original photographs
*291 flimsy papers
*102 blotting papers
*52 plaster casts

'''Ralph de Diceto''' (d. c. 1202) was [[archdeacon of Middlesex]], [[dean of St Paul's]] Cathedral (from c. 1180), and author of two chronicles, the ''Abbreviationes chronicorum'' and the ''Ymagines historiarum''.

==Early career==
Ralph is first mentioned in 1152, when he received the archdeaconry of [[Middlesex]]. He was probably born between 1120 and 1130; of his parentage and nationality we know nothing. The common statement that he derived his surname from [[Diss|Diss in Norfolk]] is a mere conjecture. ''Dicetum'' may equally well be a Latinized form of [[Dissai]], [[Dicy]], or [[Dizy (disambiguation)|Dizy]], place names in Maine, Picardy, Burgundy, and Champagne.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Diceto, Ralph de|volume=8|pages=177-178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1152 Ralph was already a master of arts and, presumably, he had studied at Paris. His reputation for learning and integrity stood high. He was regarded with respect and favor by [[Arnulf of Lisieux]] and [[Gilbert Foliot]], two of the most eminent bishops of their time. Quite naturally, the archdeacon took in the [[Becket controversy]] the same side as his friends.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

By 1164 Ralph had acquired the livings of Aynho, Northamptonshire, and Finchingfield, Essex, and served them both by vicars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spartacus-educational.com/Ralph_de_Diceto.htm Biography of Ralph de Diceto (August, 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ralph's narrative is colourless and although he was one of those who showed some sympathy for Becket at the [[council of Northampton]] in 1164, his correspondence shows that he regarded the archbishop's conduct as ill-considered and that he gave advice to those whom Becket regarded as his chief enemies.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Ralph was selected in 1166 as the envoy of the English bishops when they protested against the excommunications launched by Becket. But, apart from this episode, which he characteristically neglects to record, he remained in the background. The natural impartiality of his intellect was accentuated by a certain timidity, which is apparent in his writings no less than in his life.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Dean of St Paul's==
About 1180 Ralph became dean of [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]]. In this office, he distinguished himself by careful management of the estates, by restoring the discipline of the chapter, and by building at his own expense a deanery house. A scholar and a man of considerable erudition, he showed a strong preference for historical studies; and about the time when he was preferred to the deanery he began to collect materials for the history of his own times.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Ralph's friendships with [[Richard Fitz Nigel]], who succeeded Foliot in the see of London, with [[William Longchamp]], the chancellor of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]], and with [[Walter de Coutances]], the [[Archbishop of Rouen]], gave him excellent opportunities of collecting information.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Writings==
Ralph's two chief works, the ''Abbreviationes chronicorum'' and the ''Ymagines historiarum'', cover the history of the world from the birth of [[Christ]] to the year 1202. The former, which ends in 1147, is a work of learning and industry, but is almost entirely based upon extant sources. The latter, beginning as a compilation from [[Robert de Monte]] and the letters of Foliot, becomes an original authority c. 1172 and a contemporary record c. 1181. In precision and fullness of detail the ''Ymagines'' are inferior to the chronicles of [[Roger of Hoveden]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger's two ''Gesta'' were formerly attributed to [[Benedictus Abbas]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Though an annalist, Ralph is careless in his chronology. The documents which he incorporates, while often important, are selected on no principle. He has little sense of style but displays considerable insight when he ventures to discuss a political situation. For this reason, and on account of the details with which they supplement the more important chronicles of the period, the ''Ymagines'' are a valuable though a secondary source.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''The Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne''', the oldest provincial [[Antiquarian#Antiquarian societies|antiquarian society]] in England, was founded in 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newcastle-antiquaries.org.uk/index.php?pageId=278 |title=The Society's History |publisher=Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne |date=2013 |accessdate=2015-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] under English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|230888|THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has had a long-standing interest in the archaeology of the [[North East England|north-east of England]], particularly of [[Hadrian's Wall]], but also covering prehistoric and medieval periods, as well as [[industrial archaeology]]. It has also maintained an interest in the traditional music of the north-east of England, and particularly the [[Northumbrian smallpipes]]. 

The Society maintains several important collections. Its archaeological collection is held at the [[Great North Museum]]; its bagpipe collection, based on the collection assembled by [[William Alfred Cocks|William Cocks]], is held at in [[Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum]]; its collection of manuscripts is held at the [[Northumberland Record Office]]. Its journal is '''''Archaeologia Aeliana''''',&lt;ref&gt;ISSN 0261-3417&lt;/ref&gt; first published in 1822, and now published annually.

==Traditional music==
In 1855, the Society set up an Ancient Melodies Committee, with the object of collecting and preserving the characteristic songs and pipe music of the county. Its members were William Kell, John Clerevaulx Fenwick, and Robert White, together with John Collingwood Bruce a Secretary of the Society, appointed ''ex officio''. In 1857, the Committee delivered a preliminary report to the Duke of Northumberland, with the pipers [[William Green (piper)|William Green]] and [[Robert Reid (pipemaker)|James Reid]] both providing musical illustrations. However, they were reluctant to publish at this stage, considering that the question of distinguishing Northumbrian tunes from Scottish or southern English ones deserved more work. 

In the same year [[Thomas Doubleday]] wrote an open letter to the Duke &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xyNcAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ancient Northumbrian Music]&lt;/ref&gt;, criticising the slow progress of the Committee's work. He also made some observations on the characteristics of the unkeyed [[Northumbrian smallpipes]], with its distinctive closed fingering, which gives the instrument a brilliant staccato sound; he also lamented the tendency of some players to attempt inappropriate music, such as waltzes, on the newer keyed instrument. 

The Committee's work seems to have stalled after the deaths of White and Kell, and Fenwick's move to London, but the Society published the ''[[Northumbrian Minstrelsy]]'' in 1882, edited by Rev. [[John Collingwood Bruce]] and [[John Stokoe (author)|John Stokoe]]. This played a significant role in supporting the traditional instrumental music and song of the north-east of England.&lt;ref&gt;Northumbrian Minstrelsy, reprint, with foreword by A.L. Lloyd, Hatboro, Pennsylvania, 1965. https://archive.org/stream/ACollectionOfTheBalladsMelodiesAndSmall-pipeTunesOfNorthumbria/NorthumbrianBallads_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of the smallpipe tunes they published were drastically simplified, in particular dropping the variations found in the collection of [[John Peacock (piper)|John Peacock]], which they had used as a source. They also used very few of the tunes in  the [[William Vickers manuscript]], which was in their possession. Though primarily a fiddler's tunebook, it does contain many local pipe tunes. They also ignored the playing of contemporary traditional pipers such as [[Old Tom Clough]] and [[Thomas Todd]]. Despite these shortcomings, the book was very significant in the revival of wider interest in the smallpipes and its music.

'''The Interactive Encyclopedia System''', or '''TIES''', was a [[hypertext]] system developed at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] by [[Ben Shneiderman]] in 1983. The earliest versions of TIES ran in [[MS-DOS|DOS]] text mode, using the cursor arrow keys for navigating through information. A later version of HyperTIES for the Sun workstation was developed using the [[NeWS]] window system, with an authoring tool based on UniPress's [[Gosling Emacs]] text editor. 

==HyperTIES==
The TIES program has evolved into the HyperTIES commercial product, sold by the Cognetics Corporation. HyperTIES has a small feature set and has touch-screen support which makes it optimal for public displays and information kiosks. As for navigation types, only reference links are supported, which can be either text or graphics. The [[computer mouse|mouse]] pointer also highlights anchors when passing over them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5059">'''Universal Acceptance''' (UA) is the principle that every [[top-level domain]] (TLD) should function within all applications regardless of script, number of characters, or how new it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/universal-acceptance-2012-02-25-en|title=ICANN - Universal Acceptance|last=|first=|date=February 25, 2012|website=ICANN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, there were a limited number of TLDs available in strings of two or three Latin-script characters. This began to change in 2000, when ICANN introduced new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) that were longer than three characters, such as [[.info]] and [[.museum]]. Then in 2010, the first Internationalised Domain Names (IDNs), or domain names using non-Latin characters, were introduced. Finally, in 2013 [[ICANN]]’s New gTLD Program introuced over 1,000 new gTLDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2010-05-05-en|title=First IDN ccTLDs available|last=|first=|date=May 5, 2010|website=ICANN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One issue surrounding the expanision of the Domain Name System’s Root Zone has been the ability of Internet-based applications and systems to handle these domain names. For the principle of Universal Acceptance to be realized, all valid domain names and email addresses must be accepted, validated, stored, processed and displayed correctly and consistently by all Internet-enabled applications, devices and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uasg.tech/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/UASG005-160302-en-quickguide-digital.pdf|title=UASG Quick Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=Universal Acceptance Steering Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal Acceptance Steering Group==
In February 2015, the Universal Acceptance Steering Group (UASG) was formed by the ICANN community to facilitate the adoption of Universal Acceptance principles by software developers and website owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/universal-acceptance-2012-02-25-en|title=ICANN - Universal Acceptance|last=|first=|date=February 25, 2012|website=ICANN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal Acceptance of Popular Web Browsers==
One of the primary ways of interfacing with the Internet is through web browsers. For this reason, the UASG commissioned a report on the performance of major browsers in the treatment and acceptance of 17 different domain names registered for the purpose of providing test cases for UA readiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uasg.tech/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/UASG-Report-UASG016.pdf|title=Universal Acceptance of Popular Browsers |last=|first=|date=|website=Universal Acceptance Steering Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uasg.tech/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/UASG004-Use-Cases-for-UA-Readiness-Evaluation-2017-04-17.pdf|title=Use Cases for UA Readiness Evaluation|last=|first=|date=|website=Universal Acceptance Steering Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study found that desktop browsers generally performed well, but only [[Internet Explorer]] performed as expected. Common problems among the other browsers included the failure to properly render the URLs in the tab title bar and failing to treat an ideographic [[full stop]] as a delimiter. On mobile platforms, the results of the tests were much more varied, with the same browsers performing differently based on the [[operating system]], with one of the most common problems being the proper display of [[Unicode]] URLs.

The study concluded that developers are making progress in making browsers UA Ready, but there is more work to on every browser except Internet Explorer, a browser that has been discontinued.

'''The Woody Guthrie Foundation''', founded in 1972, is a non-profit organization which formerly served as administrator and caretaker of the [[Woody Guthrie]] Archives. Dedicated to the preservation and dissemination of information about Guthrie's vast cultural legacy, the Woody Guthrie Archives houses the largest collection of Woody Guthrie material in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/535470 3rd Annual Woody Guthrie Fellowship Program Opens]. [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI News]], September 21, 2007. Retrieved November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The archives opened to the public in New York City in 1996. The archives were subsequently moved to the new [[Woody Guthrie Center]] in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2013, after being acquired by the Tulsa-based [[George Kaiser]] Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/arts/music/woody-guthrie-gets-a-belated-honor-in-oklahoma.html?ref=arts&amp;_r=0]. December 28, 2011.

The Woody Guthrie Center features, in addition to the archives, a museum focused on the life and the influence of Guthrie through his music, writings, art, and political activities. The museum is open to the public; the archives is open only to researchers by appointment. The archives contains thousands of items related to Guthrie, including original artwork, books, correspondence, lyrics, manuscripts, media, notebooks, periodicals, personal papers, photographs, scrapbooks, and other special collections.&lt;ref&gt;http://woodyguthriecenter.org/archives/&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2007, Woody Guthrie Publications, in cooperation with the Woody Guthrie Foundation released ''The Live Wire: Woody Guthrie in Performance 1949'', accompanied by a 72-page book describing the performance and the project. Paul Braverman, a student at [[Rutgers University]] in 1949, made the recordings himself using a small wire recorder at a Guthrie concert in Newark, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;Himes, Geoffrey. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/arts/music/02himes.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5124&amp;en=732c25c27d89715f&amp;ex=1346299200&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink Dead 40 Years, Woody Guthrie Stays Busy.] ''The New York Times'', September 2, 2007. Retrieved on February 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 10, 2008, the release was the recipient of a Grammy Award in the category Best Historical Album.&lt;ref&gt;Grammy.com.

The Foundation was previously based in Brooklyn, New York and directed by Woody Guthrie's daughter Nora Guthrie. Nora Guthrie opened up the Foundation's archives to musicians of many types, who she encouraged to write and record music for the many hundreds of Woody Guthrie's written lyrics. Following Woody Guthrie's death, many of these lyrics were without surviving melodies, as Woody did not write musical notation and never recorded (or taught anyone) the majority of his original compositions.

In 1995, Nora Guthrie had invited alternative folk-rocker [[Billy Bragg]] to select some lyrics from the archive to be set to music and then to be recorded commercially.  Bragg then invited the [[Alternative country|alt-country]] band [[Wilco]] to help complete the project.  Wilco and Bragg released 2 acclaimed "Mermaid Avenue" albums in 1998 and 2000, using Woody's lyrics set to their own musical compositions. Also, a film documentary [[Man in the Sand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdtalk.com/noraguthrieinterview.html Man in The Sand: A Talk with Nora Guthrie]. [[DVDTalk|DVDtalk.com]], Retrieved November 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; was released documenting not only the making of the Mermaid Avenue albums but also Bragg's exploration of Woody Guthrie's origins in hometown [[Okemah, Oklahoma]]. Many other collaborative projects by others have followed.

* 2018 - Jimmy LaFave - ''Peace Town'' (album) - this posthumous release contains 3 songs with Guthrie lyrics set to LaFave music, including the title track.

One of the lyrics which was worked several times by Billy Bragg, "All You Fascists", has subsequently surfaced in a recording of a 1944 radio program "The Martins and the McCoys".  Guthrie appeared in the program with other folk singers and can be heard singing "All of You Fascists Bound to Lose&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwcKwGS7OSQ - Retrieved September 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;, set to his original melody, which is of course substantially different from the melodies Bragg has devised for it.

Given the quantity of these posthumous collaborations, it was perhaps inevitable that there would be some lyrics set to more than one melody. For instance, track 3 on the Wasserman album ("Ease My Revolutionary Mind") uses the same set of lyrics as track 3 on the Farrar album (as well as track 3 on the Autumn Defense album). Track 2 on the Brooke album ("You'd Oughta Be Satisfied Now") uses the same set of lyrics as track 5 on the third volume of "Mermaid Avenue". The Woody Guthrie Publications website&lt;ref&gt;http://www.woodyguthrie.org/Lyrics/Lyrics.htm&lt;/ref&gt; lists Jonatha Brooke's version of "You'd Oughta Be Satisfied Now" as a "[[derivative work]]".
