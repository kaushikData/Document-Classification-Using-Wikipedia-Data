[[File:Arthur Oncken Lovejoy.jpg|thumb|right|Arthur Oncken Lovejoy, historian and philosopher]]
'''Arthur Oncken Lovejoy''' (October 10, 1873 &amp;ndash; December 30, 1962) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[intellectual history|intellectual historian]], who founded the discipline known as the [[history of ideas]] with his book ''The Great Chain of Being'' (1936), on the [[Great chain of being|topic of that name]], which is regarded as 'probably the single most influential work in the history of ideas in the United States during the last half century'.&lt;ref name="Knuuttila" &gt;Simo Knuuttila (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8B8yBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3  ''Reforging the Great Chain of Being: Studies of the History of Modal Theories,''] Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2013 p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Lovejoy was born in [[Berlin]], [[German Empire|Germany]] while his father was doing medical research there. Eighteen months later, his mother committed suicide, whereupon his father gave up medicine and became a clergyman. Lovejoy studied [[philosophy]], first at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] at [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], then at [[Harvard]]&lt;ref name="DictPR"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33983842|title=Dictionary of philosophy and religion: Eastern and Western thought|last=Reese|first=William|date=1996|publisher=Humanities Press|isbn=0391038648|location=Atlantic Highlands, N.J.|oclc=33983842|page=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; under [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]]. In 1901, he resigned from his first job, at [[Stanford University]], to protest the dismissal of a colleague who had offended a trustee. The President of Harvard then vetoed hiring Lovejoy on the grounds that he was a known troublemaker. Over the subsequent decade, he taught at [[Washington University]], [[Columbia University]], and the [[University of Missouri]]. He never married.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

As a professor of philosophy at [[Johns Hopkins University]] from 1910 to 1938, Lovejoy founded and long presided over that university's History of Ideas Club, where many prominent and budding intellectual and social historians, as well as [[literary critic]]s, gathered. In 1940 he founded the ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]''. Lovejoy insisted that the history of ideas should focus on "unit ideas," single concepts (namely simple concepts sharing an abstract name with other concepts that were to be conceptually distinguished). Abstract nouns like 'pragmatism' 'idealism', 'rationalism' and the like were, in Lovejoy's view, constituted by distinct, analytically separate ideas, which the historian of the genealogy of ideas had to thresh out, and show how the basic unit ideas combine and recombine with each other over time.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur O. Lovejoy, [''The Great Chain of Being,''] (1936) Harper &amp; Row 1960 pp.5ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has, according to Simo Knuuttila, exercised a greater attraction on literary critics than on philosophers.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Lovejoy was active in the public arena. He helped found the [[American Association of University Professors]] and the [[Maryland]] chapter of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].  However, he qualified his belief in [[civil liberties]] to exclude what he considered threats to a free system. Thus, at the height of the [[McCarthy Era]] (in the February 14, 1952 edition of the ''Journal of Philosophy'') Lovejoy stated that, since it was a "matter of empirical fact" that membership in the [[Communist Party]] contributed "to the triumph of a world-wide organization" which was opposed to "freedom of inquiry, of opinion and of teaching," membership in the party constituted grounds for dismissal from academic positions. He also published numerous opinion pieces in the Baltimore press. He died in [[Baltimore]] on December 30, 1962.

==Scholarship==
In the domain of [[epistemology]], Lovejoy is remembered for an influential critique of the pragmatic movement, especially in the essay "The Thirteen Pragmatisms", written in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ATV5bb3ZsQC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=Arthur+Lovejoy+%22Thirteen+Pragmatisms%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y5fb_zAjG_&amp;sig=yTplB16a_MPxBvqvJPvEPanm8AA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9g5dSpCLBYvysgOW7ZCvCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 The Thirteen Pragmatisms], The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods, now''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'', Part I, 2 January 1908 p. 5-12.  Part II, 16 January 1908, p. 29-39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. F. Bynum|William F. Bynum]], looking back at Lovejoy's ''Great Chain of Being'' after 40 years, describes it as "a familiar feature of the intellectual landscape", indicating its great influence and "brisk" ongoing sales. Bynum argues that much more research is needed into how the concept of the great chain of being was replaced, but he agrees that Lovejoy was right that the crucial period was the end of the 18th century when "the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s chain of being was dismantled".&lt;ref&gt;William F. Bynum: [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1975HisSc..13....1B&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf "The Great Chain of Being after Forty Years: An Appraisal"], ''History of Science'' 13 (1975): 1-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's given name, which means "Blessed", varies among different languages. In Hebrew, it is written {{Hebrew|ברוך שפינוזה}}. His Portuguese name is {{lang|pt|Benedito "Bento" de Espinosa}}. In his Latin works, he used {{lang-la|Benedictus de Spinoza|links=no}}.

Spinoza was raised in a Portuguese-Jewish community in [[Amsterdam]]. He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the nature of the [[God|Divine]]. [[Portuguese Synagogue (Amsterdam)|Jewish religious authorities]] issued a ''[[Herem (censure)|herem]]'' ({{Hebrew|חרם}}) against him, causing him to be effectively shunned by Jewish society at age 23. His books were also later put on the Catholic Church's ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]]''.

Spinoza lived an outwardly simple life as an optical [[lens (optics)|lens]] grinder, collaborating on microscope and telescope lens designs with [[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.|Constantijn]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]]. He turned down rewards and honours throughout his life, including prestigious teaching positions. He died at the age of 44 in 1677 from a lung illness, perhaps [[tuberculosis]] or [[silicosis]] exacerbated by the inhalation of fine glass dust while grinding lenses. He is buried in the churchyard of the Christian [[Nieuwe Kerk (The Hague)|Nieuwe Kerk]] in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Speculum Spinozanum, 1677–1977 |first1=Benedictus |last1=de Spinoza |first2=Siegfried |last2=Hessing |publisher=[[Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul]] |year=1977 |page=828

Spinoza's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', the ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', was published posthumously in the year of his death. The work opposed Descartes' philosophy of [[mind–body dualism]], and earned Spinoza recognition as one of [[Western philosophy]]'s most important thinkers. In it, "Spinoza wrote the last indisputable Latin masterpiece, and one in which the refined conceptions of medieval philosophy are finally turned against themselves and destroyed entirely".{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=32}} [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] said, "The fact is that Spinoza is made a testing-point in modern philosophy, so that it may really be said: You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all."&lt;ref name="Hegel's History of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ESNZ3TUdN40C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=%22you+are+either+a+spinozist+or+not+a+philosopher+at+all%22 |title=Hegel's History of Philosophy |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=2 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110513033919/https://books.google.com/books?id=ESNZ3TUdN40C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=%22you+are+either+a+spinozist+or+not+a+philosopher+at+all%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XRsqJEbyNT&amp;sig=bCClaJ9V6lL_CJbOR-S3zaGwHqo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result| archivedate= 13 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophical accomplishments and moral character prompted [[Gilles Deleuze]] to name him "the 'prince' of philosophers."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in the translator's preface of Deleuze ''Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Family and community origins===
[[File:Spinoza -.jpg|thumb|His statue in Amsterdam]]
Spinoza's ancestors were of Sephardic Jewish descent and were a part of the community of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews |Portuguese Jews]] that had settled in the city of [[Amsterdam]] in the wake of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] (1536), which had resulted in [[converso|forced conversions]] and expulsions from the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Attracted by the Decree of Toleration issued in 1579 by the [[Union of Utrecht]], Portuguese converts to Catholicism first sailed to Amsterdam in 1593 and promptly [[Anusim|reconverted to Judaism]].{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=15}} In 1598, permission was granted to build a synagogue, and in 1615 an ordinance for the admission and government of the Jews was passed.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=19}} As a community of exiles, the Portuguese Jews of Amsterdam were highly proud of their identity.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=19}}

Although the Portuguese name "de Espinosa" or "Espinosa," then spelled with a "z," can be confused with the Spanish "de Espinoza" or "Espinoza," there is no evidence in Spinoza's genealogy that his family came from [[Espinosa de los Monteros]], near [[Burgos]], or from [[Espinosa de Cerrato]], near [[Palencia]], both in [[Castile (historical region)|Northern Castile]], [[Spain]].{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=20}} Still, this was a common Portuguese ''conversos'' family name.&lt;ref&gt;The family was probably [[Alhambra decree|expelled from Spain]] in 1492 and fled to Portugal. Portugal compelled them to convert to Catholicism in 1498. Cf. Javier Muguerza in his ''Desde la perplejidad''; see also Ben-Menahem, Ari, ''Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Volume 1'' (Springer, 2009), p. 1095.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's father was born roughly a century after the forced conversions in the small Portuguese city of [[Vidigueira]], near [[Beja, Portugal|Beja]] in [[Alentejo]]. When Spinoza's father Miguel (Michael) was still a child, Spinoza's grandfather, Isaac de Spinoza, who was from [[Lisbon]], took his family to [[Nantes]] in France. They were expelled in 1615 and moved to [[Rotterdam]], where Isaac died in 1627. Spinoza's father and his uncle Manuel then moved to Amsterdam where they resumed the practice of Judaism. Miguel was a successful merchant and became a warden of the synagogue and of the Amsterdam Jewish school.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=19}} He buried three wives and three of his six children died before reaching adulthood.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=20}}

===17th-century Netherlands===
Amsterdam and Rotterdam operated as important [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] centres where merchant ships from many parts of the world brought people of various customs and beliefs. This flourishing commercial activity encouraged a culture relatively tolerant of the play of new ideas, to a considerable degree sheltered from the censorious hand of ecclesiastical authority (though those considered to have gone "too far" might have gotten  persecuted even in the Netherlands). Not by chance were the philosophical works of both Descartes and Spinoza developed in the cultural and intellectual background of the Dutch Republic in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, J. (1998), The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477–1806, Oxford, [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 4, 583, 677, 917.&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza may have had access to a circle of friends who were unconventional in terms of social tradition, including members of the [[Collegiants]].&lt;ref&gt;De Dijn, Herman, ''Spinoza: The Way to Wisdom'' ([[Purdue University Press]], 1996), pp. 3 &amp; 4.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the people he knew was [[Nicolas Steno|Niels Stensen]], a brilliant [[Denmark|Danish]] student in [[Leiden]];{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=195}} others included [[Albert Burgh]], with whom Spinoza is known to have corresponded.&lt;ref&gt;Curley, Edwin, "Spinoza's exchange with Albert Burgh," in Melamed &amp; Rosenthal (eds.), ''Spinoza's'' Theological-Political Treatise'': A Critical Guide'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 11–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mozes en Aäronkerk.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|Spinoza lived where the [[Mozes en Aäronkerk (Amsterdam)|Moses and Aaron Church]] is located now, and there is strong evidence that he may have been born there.&lt;ref&gt;''Die Lebensgeschichte Spinozas.

Benedito de Espinoza was born on 24 November 1632 in the [[Jodenbuurt]] in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He was the second son of Miguel de Espinoza, a successful, although not wealthy, Portuguese [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jewish]] merchant in Amsterdam.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=1}} His mother, Ana Débora, Miguel's second wife, died when Baruch was only six years old.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=23|loc="his mother's death when he was six years old"}} Spinoza's mother tongue was Portuguese, although he also knew Hebrew, Spanish, Dutch, perhaps French, and later Latin.{{sfn|Nadler|1999|p=47}} Although he wrote in Latin, Spinoza learned the language only late in his youth.

Spinoza had a traditional Jewish upbringing, attending the Keter Torah [[yeshiva]] of the Amsterdam [[Talmud Torah]] congregation headed by the learned and traditional senior Rabbi [[Saul Levi Morteira]]. His teachers also included the less traditional Rabbi [[Manasseh ben Israel]], "a man of wide learning and secular interests, a friend of [[Gerardus Vossius|Vossius]], [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]], and [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]]".{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=8}} While presumably a star pupil, and perhaps considered as a potential rabbi, Spinoza never reached the advanced study of the Torah in the upper levels of the curriculum.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=1}} Instead, at the age of 17, after the death of his elder brother, Isaac, he cut short his formal studies in order to begin working in the family importing business.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=1}}

The precise date of Spinoza's first studies of Latin with Francis van den Enden ([[Franciscus van den Enden]]) is not known. Some state it began as early as 1654-1655, when Spinoza was 20; others note that the documentary record only attests to his presence in van den Enden's circle around 1657–58. Van den Enden was a notorious free thinker, former [[Jesuit]], and radical democrat who likely introduced Spinoza to scholastic and [[modern philosophy]], including that of Descartes.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=20-21}}{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=27}}{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=189}} (A decade later, in the early 1660s, Van den Enden was considered to be a [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] and [[atheist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.telenet.be/fvde/Bio3.htm |title= Franciscus van den Enden/Biography |author=Frank Mertens, [[Ghent University]] |date=30 June 2009 |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his books were put on the Catholic [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Banned Books]].)

Spinoza's father, Miguel, died in 1654 when Spinoza was 21. He duly recited [[Kaddish]], the Jewish prayer of mourning, for eleven months as required by Jewish law.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=1}} When his sister Rebekah disputed his inheritance, he took her to court to establish his claim, won his case, but then renounced his claim in her favour.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=21}}

Spinoza adopted the Latin name Benedictus de Spinoza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Paul Strathern|Strathern]], Paul| title = Spinoza in 90 Minutes| date = 25 September 1998| publisher=[[Ivan R. Dee]]| isbn = 978-1-56663-215-7| pages = 24–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; began boarding with Van den Enden, and began teaching in his school.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=21}}{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=27}}{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=189}} Following an anecdote in an early biography by [[Johannes Colerus]],&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Colerus, ''The Life of Benedict de Spinosa'' ([[London]]: Benjamin Bragg, 1706), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; he is said to have fallen in love with his teacher's daughter, Clara, but she rejected him for a richer student. (This story has been discounted on the basis that Clara Maria van den Enden was born in 1643 and would have been no more than about 13 years old when Spinoza left Amsterdam.{{sfn|Nadler|1999|p=104}} In 1671 she married [[Theodor Kerckring|Dirck Kerckring]].)

During this period Spinoza also became acquainted with the [[Collegiants]], an anti-clerical sect of [[Remonstrants]] with tendencies towards [[rationalism]], and with the [[Mennonite]]s who had existed for a century but were close to the Remonstrants.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=20}} Many of his friends belonged to dissident [[Christian]] groups which met regularly as discussion groups and which typically rejected the authority of established churches as well as traditional dogmas.&lt;ref name=tws908&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Anthony Gottlieb]] | title = God Exists, Philosophically (review of "Spinoza: A Life" by Steven Nadler) | publisher=[[The New York Times]], Books. 18 July 1999 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/18/reviews/990718.18gottlit.html | accessdate =7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's break with the prevailing dogmas of [[Judaism]], and particularly the insistence on non-[[Law of Moses|Mosaic]] authorship of the [[Pentateuch]], was not sudden; rather, it appears to have been the result of a lengthy internal struggle: "If anyone thinks my criticism [regarding the authorship of the Bible] is of too sweeping a nature and lacking sufficient foundation, I would ask him to undertake to show us in these narratives a definite plan such as might legitimately be imitated by historians in their chronicles... If he succeeds, I shall at once admit defeat, and he will be my mighty [[Apollo]]. For I confess that all my efforts over a long period have resulted in no such discovery. Indeed, I may add that I write nothing here that is not the fruit of lengthy reflection; and although I have been educated from boyhood in the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture, I have felt bound in the end to embrace the views I here express."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Benedictus de Spinoza, Tractatus Theologico-Politicus: Gebhardt Edition ([[E.J. Brill]], 1989), p. 179 (available at https://books.google.com/books?id=y3Cd7Yd73esC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, once branded as a heretic, Spinoza's clashes with authority became more pronounced. For example, questioned by two members of his synagogue, Spinoza apparently responded that God has a body and nothing in scripture says otherwise.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=21}} He was later attacked on the steps of the synagogue by a knife-wielding assailant shouting "Heretic!" He was apparently quite shaken by this attack and for years kept (and wore) his torn cloak, unmended, as a souvenir.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=21}}

After his father's death in 1654, Spinoza and his younger brother Gabriel (Abraham){{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=1}} ran the family importing business. The business ran into serious financial difficulties, however, perhaps as a result of the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]]. In March 1656, Spinoza filed suit with the Amsterdam municipal authorities to be declared an orphan in order to escape his father's business debts and so that he could inherit his mother's estate (which at first was incorporated into his father's estate) without it being subject to his father's creditors.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=25}} In addition, after having made substantial contributions to the Talmud Torah synagogue in 1654 and 1655, he reduced his December 1655 contribution and his March 1656 pledge to nominal amounts (and the March 1656 pledge was never paid).{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=26}}{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=27}}

Spinoza was eventually able to relinquish responsibility for the business and its debts to his younger brother, Gabriel, and devote himself chiefly to the study of philosophy, especially the system expounded by [[Descartes]], and to [[optics]].

===Expulsion from the Jewish community===
On 27 July 1656, the Talmud Torah congregation of Amsterdam issued a writ of ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'' (Hebrew: {{hebrew|חרם}}, a kind of ban, shunning, ostracism, expulsion, or [[excommunication]]) against the 23-year-old Spinoza.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=21}} The following document translates the official record of the censure:{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=120}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Lords of the ma'amad, having long known of the evil opinions and acts of Baruch de Espinoza, have endeavoured by various means and promises, to turn him from his evil ways. But having failed to make him mend his wicked ways, and, on the contrary, daily receiving more and more serious information about the abominable heresies which he practised and taught and about his monstrous deeds, and having for this numerous trustworthy witnesses who have deposed and borne witness to this effect in the presence of the said Espinoza, they became convinced of the truth of the matter; and after all of this has been investigated in the presence of the honourable ''chachamin'' [sages], they have decided, with their consent, that the said Espinoza should be excommunicated and expelled from the people of Israel. By the decree of the angels, and by the command of the holy men, we excommunicate, expel, curse and damn Baruch de Espinoza, with the consent of God, Blessed be He, and with the consent of all the Holy Congregation, in front of these holy Scrolls with the [[613 commandments|six-hundred-and-thirteen precepts]] which are written therein, with the excommunication with which [[Joshua]] [[Battle of Jericho|banned Jericho]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Joshua]] 6, 26: "And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the Lord, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it."&lt;/ref&gt; with the curse with which [[Elisha#Biography|Elisha]] cursed the boys &lt;ref&gt;[[Second Book of Kings]] 2, 23–24: "And as he [Elisha] was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.&lt;/ref&gt; and with all the curses which are written in the Book of the Law. Cursed be he by day and cursed be he by night; cursed be he when he lies down, and cursed be he when he rises up; cursed be he when he goes out, and cursed be he when he comes in. The Lord will not spare him; the anger and wrath of the Lord will rage against this man, and bring upon him all the curses which are written in this book, and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven, and the Lord will separate him to his injury from all the tribes of Israel with all the curses of the covenant, which are written in the Book of the Law. But you who cleave unto the Lord God are all alive this day. We order that no one should communicate with him orally or in writing, or show him any favour, or stay with him under the same roof, or within four [[ell]]s of him, or read anything composed or written by him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Espinoza estatua.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Statue of Spinoza, near his house on the Paviljoensgracht in [[The Hague]].]]
The Talmud Torah congregation issued censure routinely, on matters great and small, so such an edict was not unusual.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Melamed, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Johns Hopkins University, speaking at an Artistic Director's Roundtable, Theater J, Washington D.C., 18 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=7}} The language of Spinoza's censure is unusually harsh, however, and does not appear in any other censure known to have been issued by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=2}} The exact reason for expelling Spinoza is not stated.&lt;ref&gt;Steven B. Smith, ''Spinoza's book of life: freedom and redemption in the Ethics'', Yale University Press (1 December 2003), p. xx – Introduction [https://books.google.com/books?id=j0dMphwIwQ8C&amp;pg=PT19&amp;lpg=PT19&amp;dq=cherem+-+spinoza+-+unknown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OPBy3G58Jj&amp;sig=B4K5gEHFfPBwKtnK0kPxfqeE2mY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LlJITLe9FMT7lweKpMWbCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cherem%20-%20spinoza%20-%20unknown&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The censure refers only to the "abominable heresies that he practised and taught," to his "monstrous deeds," and to the testimony of witnesses "in the presence of the said Espinoza." There is no record of such testimony, but there appear to have been several likely reasons for the issuance of the censure.

First, there were Spinoza's radical theological views that he was apparently expressing in public. As philosopher and Spinoza biographer Steven Nadler puts it: "No doubt he was giving utterance to just those ideas that would soon appear in his philosophical treatises. In those works, Spinoza denies the immortality of the soul; strongly rejects the notion of a providential God—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and claims that the Law was neither literally given by God nor any longer binding on Jews. Can there be any mystery as to why one of history's boldest and most radical thinkers was sanctioned by an orthodox Jewish community?"&lt;ref&gt;Steven Nadler, Baruch Spinoza, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, First published Fri 29 June 2001; substantive revision Mon 1 December 2008, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#Bio plato.standord.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the Amsterdam Jewish community was largely composed of former "conversos" who had fled from the Portuguese Inquisition within the previous century, with their children and grandchildren. This community must have been concerned to protect its reputation from any association with Spinoza lest his controversial views provide the basis for their own possible persecution or expulsion.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|pp=17-22}} There is little evidence that the Amsterdam municipal authorities were directly involved in Spinoza's censure itself. But "in 1619, the town council expressly ordered [the Portuguese Jewish community] to regulate their conduct and ensure that the members of the community kept to a strict observance of Jewish law."{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=19}} Other evidence makes it clear that the danger of upsetting the civil authorities was never far from mind, such as bans adopted by the synagogue on public wedding or funeral processions and on discussing religious matters with Christians, lest such activity might "disturb the liberty we enjoy."{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=20}} Thus, the issuance of Spinoza's censure was almost certainly, in part, an exercise in self-censorship by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|pp=19-21}}

Third, it appears likely that Spinoza had already taken the initiative to separate himself from the Talmud Torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility to Judaism itself. He had probably stopped attending services at the synagogue, either after the lawsuit with his sister or after the knife attack on its steps. He might already have been voicing the view expressed later in his ''Theological-Political Treatise'' that the civil authorities should suppress Judaism as harmful to the Jews themselves. Either for financial or other reasons,{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=28}}{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=189}} he had in any case effectively stopped contributing to the synagogue by March 1656. He had also committed the "monstrous deed," contrary to the regulations of the synagogue and the views of some rabbinical authorities (including [[Maimonides]]), of filing suit in a civil court rather than with the synagogue authorities{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=25}}—to renounce his father's heritage, no less. Upon being notified of the issuance of the censure, he is reported to have said: "Very well; this does not force me to do anything that I would not have done of my own accord, had I not been afraid of a scandal."{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=22}} Thus, unlike most of the censure issued routinely by the Amsterdam congregation to discipline its members, the censure issued against Spinoza did not lead to repentance and so was never withdrawn.

After the censure, Spinoza is said to have addressed an "Apology" (defence), written in Spanish, to the elders of the synagogue, "in which he defended his views as orthodox, and condemned the rabbis for accusing him of 'horrible practices and other enormities' merely because he had neglected ceremonial observances."{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=22}} This "Apology" [[Lost works|does not survive]], but some of its contents may later have been included in his ''Theological-Political Treatise''.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=22}} For example, he cited a series of cryptic statements by medieval Biblical commentator [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] intimating that some apparently anachronistic passages of the Pentateuch (i.e., "[t]he Canaanite was then in the land," Genesis 12:6, which ibn Ezra called a "mystery" and exhorted those "who understand it [to] keep silent") were not of [[Mosaic authorship]] as proof that his own views had valid historical precedent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The most remarkable aspect of the censure may be not so much its issuance, or even Spinoza's refusal to submit, but the fact that Spinoza's expulsion from the Jewish community did not lead to his conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Yitzhak Melamed 2012"&gt;Yitzhak Melamed, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Johns Hopkins University, speaking at an Artistic Director's Roundtable, Theater J, Washington D.C., 18 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza kept the Latin (and so implicitly Christian) name Benedict de Spinoza, maintained a close association with the [[Collegiants]] (a Christian sect of Remonstrants) and [[Quaker|Quakers]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Benedict-de-Spinoza/Association-with-Collegiants-and-Quakers#ref1029792 Spinoza's Biography] in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;, even moved to a town near the Collegiants' headquarters, and was buried in a Christian Protestant graveyard—but there is no evidence or suggestion that he ever accepted baptism or participated in a Christian mass or Quaker meeting. Thus, by default, Baruch de Espinoza became the first secular Jew of modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Yitzhak Melamed 2012"/&gt;

In September 2012, the Portugees-Israëlietische Gemeente te Amsterdam asked the chief rabbi of their community [[Haham Pinchas Toledano]] to reconsider the cherem after consulting several Spinoza experts. However he declined to remove it, citing Spinoza's "preposterous ideas, where he was tearing apart the very fundamentals of our religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Simon Rocker | title = Why Baruch Spinoza is still excommunicated | newspaper = The Jewish Chronicle Online | date = August 28, 2014 | url = http://www.thejc.com/judaism/judaism-features/121838/why-baruch-spinoza-still-excommunicated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza spent his remaining 21 years writing and studying as a private scholar.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt;

Spinoza believed in a "Philosophy of tolerance and benevolence"&lt;ref name="God Exists, Philosophically"&gt;{{cite news|last1=GOTTLIEB|first1=ANTHONY|title=God Exists, Philosophically|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/18/reviews/990718.18gottlit.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and actually lived the life which he preached. He was criticized and ridiculed during his life and afterwards for his alleged atheism. However, even those who were against him "had to admit he lived a saintly life".&lt;ref name="God Exists, Philosophically"/&gt; Besides the religious controversies, nobody really had much bad to say about Spinoza other than, "he sometimes enjoyed watching spiders chase flies".&lt;ref name="God Exists, Philosophically"/&gt;

After the cherem, the Amsterdam municipal authorities expelled Spinoza from Amsterdam, "responding to the appeals of the rabbis, and also of the Calvinist clergy, who had been vicariously offended by the existence of a free thinker in the synagogue".{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=22}} He spent a brief time in or near the village of [[Ouderkerk aan de Amstel]], but returned soon afterwards to Amsterdam and lived there quietly for several years, giving private philosophy lessons and grinding lenses, before leaving the city in 1660 or 1661.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=22}}

During this time in Amsterdam, Spinoza wrote his ''Short Treatise on God, Man, and His Well-Being'', which he never published in his lifetime—assuming with good reason that it might get suppressed. Two Dutch translations of it survive, discovered about 1810."{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=22}}

Spinoza moved around 1660 or 1661 from Amsterdam to [[Rijnsburg]] (near [[Leiden]]), the headquarters of the Collegiants.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=23}} In Rijnsburg, he began work on his ''Descartes' "Principles of Philosophy"'' as well as on his masterpiece, the ''Ethics''. In 1663, he returned briefly to Amsterdam, where he finished and published ''Descartes' "Principles of Philosophy,"'' the only work published in his lifetime under his own name, and then moved the same year to [[Voorburg]].{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=24}}

In Voorburg, Spinoza continued work on the ''Ethics'' and corresponded with scientists, philosophers, and theologians throughout Europe.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=25}} He also wrote and published his ''Theological Political Treatise'' in 1670, in defence of secular and constitutional government, and in support of [[Johan de Witt|Jan de Witt]], the Grand Pensionary of the Netherlands, against the Stadtholder, the Prince of Orange.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=25}}{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=26}} [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] visited Spinoza and claimed that Spinoza's life was in danger when supporters of the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]] murdered de Witt in 1672.&lt;ref&gt;"…he [Spinoza] told me [Leibniz] he had a strong desire, on the day of the massacre of Mess. De Witt, to sally forth at night, and put up somewhere, near the place of the massacre, a paper with the words ''Ultimi barbarorum'' [ultimate barbarity]. But his host had shut the house to prevent his going out, for he would have run the risk of being torn to pieces."

===Lens-grinding and optics===
Spinoza earned a modest living from lens-grinding and instrument making, yet he was involved in important optical investigations of the day while living in Voorburg, through correspondence and friendships with scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] and mathematician [[Johannes Hudde]], including debate over microscope design with Huygens, favouring small objectives&lt;ref&gt;Christiaan Huygens, ''Oeuvres complètes'', Letter No. 1638, 11 May 1668&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborating on calculations for a prospective 40&amp;nbsp;ft. telescope which would have been one of the largest in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Christiaan Huygens, ''aOeuvres complètes'', letter to his brother 23 September 1667&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of Spinoza's lenses was much praised by Christiaan Huygens, among others.{{sfn|Nadler|2001|p=183}} In fact, his technique and instruments were so esteemed that [[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.|Constantijn Huygens]] ground a "clear and bright" 42&amp;nbsp;ft. telescope lens in 1687 from one of Spinoza's grinding dishes, ten years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Christiaan Huygens, ''Oeuvres complètes'', vol. XXII, p. 732, footnote&lt;/ref&gt; The exact type of lenses that Spinoza made are not known, but very likely included lenses for both the microscope and telescope. He was said by anatomist [[Theodor Kerckring]] to have produced an "excellent" microscope, the quality of which was the foundation of Kerckring's anatomy claims.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Kerckring, "Spicilegium Anatomicum" Observatio XCIII (1670)&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as a lens and instrument maker, he was also supported by small but regular donations from close friends.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt;

===The Hague===
In 1670, Spinoza moved to [[The Hague]] where he lived on a small pension from Jan de Witt and a small annuity from the brother of his dead friend, Simon de Vries.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=26}} He worked on the ''Ethics'', wrote an unfinished Hebrew grammar, began his ''Political Treatise'', wrote two scientific essays ("On the Rainbow" and "On the Calculation of Chances"), and began a Dutch translation of the Bible (which he later destroyed by burning).{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=26}}

Spinoza was offered the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Heidelberg]], but he refused it, perhaps because of the possibility that it might in some way curb his [[freedom of thought]].&lt;ref&gt;Chauí 1995 (2001 ed.), ch. 1, pp. 30–31: |A commentary on Descartes' work, Principles of Cartesian Philosophy, only work published under his own name, brought him on an invitation to teach philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. Spinoza, however, refused, thinking that it might be demanded the renouncement of his freedom of thought, for the invite stipulated that all care should be taken to "not insult the principles of the established religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1676, Spinoza met with Leibniz at The Hague for a discussion of his principal philosophical work, ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', which had been completed in 1676. This meeting was described in [[Matthew Stewart (philosopher)|Matthew Stewart]]'s ''The Courtier and the Heretic''.&lt;ref name="Lucas1960"&gt;Lucas, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's health began to fail in 1676, and he died on 21 February 1677 at the age of 44.{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=29}} His premature death was said to be due to lung illness, possibly [[silicosis]] as a result of breathing in glass dust from the lenses that he ground. Later, a shrine was made of his home in The Hague.&lt;ref name=tws9914&gt;{{cite news

Spinoza also corresponded with [[Peter Serrarius]], a radical Protestant and [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] merchant.

When the public reactions to the anonymously published ''Theologico-Political Treatise'' were extremely unfavourable to his brand of Cartesianism, Spinoza was compelled to abstain from publishing more of his works. Wary and independent, he wore a [[signet ring]] which he used to mark his letters and which was engraved with the word ''caute'' (Latin for "cautiously") underneath a rose, itself a symbol of secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Matthew, ''The Courtier and the Heretic'' (W.

The ''Ethics'' and all other works, apart from the ''Descartes' Principles of Philosophy'' and the ''Theologico-Political Treatise'', were published after his death in the ''[[Opera Posthuma]]'', edited by his friends in secrecy to avoid confiscation and destruction of manuscripts.

In a letter, written in December 1675 and sent to Albert Burgh, who wanted to defend [[Catholicism]], Spinoza clearly explained his view of both Catholicism and [[Islam]].

===Substance, attributes, and modes===
{{Main article|Philosophy of Baruch Spinoza}}
{{Quote|These are the fundamental concepts with which Spinoza sets forth a vision of Being, illuminated by his awareness of God. They may seem strange at first sight. To the question "What is?" he replies: "Substance, its attributes, and modes".|[[Karl Jaspers]]&lt;ref&gt;''Spinoza'', Karl Jaspers p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Spinoza argued that God exists and is abstract and impersonal.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; Spinoza's view of God is what [[Charles Hartshorne]] describes as [[Classical Pantheism]].&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, "Philosophers Speak of God," Humanity Books, 1953 ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza has also been described as an "[[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] materialist,"&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt; specifically in reference to his opposition to Cartesian mind-body dualism. This view was held by Epicureans before him, as they believed that atoms with their probabilistic paths were the only substance that existed fundamentally.&lt;ref name="Konstan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/epicurus/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=David|last=Konstan|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=21 February 2017|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', Part IV, preface: "''Deus seu Natura''".&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza, however, deviated significantly from Epicureans by adhering to strict determinism, much like the Stoics before him, in contrast to the Epicurean belief in the probabilistic path of atoms, which is more in line with contemporary thought on [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/spinoza.shtml|title=Baruch Spinoza, "Human Beings are Determined"|author=|date=|work=Lander.edu|access-date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Konstan"/&gt; Spinoza's system imparted order and unity to the tradition of radical [[thought]], offering powerful weapons for prevailing against "received authority." He contended that everything that exists in Nature (i.e., everything in the Universe) is one Reality (substance) and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality that surrounds us and of which we are part. Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality,&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt; namely a single, fundamental [[Substance theory|substance]] (meaning "that which stands beneath" rather than "matter") that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser "entities" are actually modes or modifications, that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects, and that the complex chain of cause-and-effect is understood only in part. His identification of God with nature was more fully explained in his posthumously published ''Ethics.''&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; Spinoza's main contention with Cartesian mind–body dualism was that, if mind and body were truly distinct, then it is not clear how they can coordinate in any manner. Humans presume themselves to have [[free will]], he argues, which is a result of their awareness of appetites that affect their minds, while being unable to understand the reasons why they desire what they desire and act as they do.

Spinoza contends that "''Deus sive Natura''" is a being of infinitely many attributes, of which thought and extension are two. His account of the nature of reality then seems to treat the physical and mental worlds as intertwined, causally related, and deriving from the same Substance. It is important to note that, in Parts 3 through 4 of the ''Ethics," Spinoza describes how the human mind is affected by both mental and physical factors. He directly contests and denies dualism. The universal Substance emanates both body and mind; while they are different attributes, there is no fundamental difference between these aspects. This formulation is a historically significant solution to the [[mind–body problem]] known as [[neutral monism]]. Spinoza's system also envisages a God that does not rule over the universe by Providence, by which it can and does make changes, but a God that is the deterministic system of which everything in nature is a part. Spinoza argues that "things could not have been produced by God in any other way or in any other order than is the case,";&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Spinoza. ''Ethics'', in'' Spinoza: Complete Works'', trans. by Samuel Shirley and ed. by Michael L. Morgan (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002), see Part I, Proposition 33.&lt;/ref&gt; he directly challenges a transcendental God that actively responds to events in the universe. Everything that has and will happen is a part of a long chain of cause-and-effect, which, at a metaphysical level, humans are unable to change. No amount of prayer or ritual will sway God. Only knowledge of God provides the best response to the world around them.
Not only is it impossible for two infinite Substances to exist (two infinities being absurd),&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Part I, Proposition 6.&lt;/ref&gt; God as the ultimate Substance cannot be affected by anything else, or else it would be affected by something else, and not be the fundamental, all-pervasive Substance.

Spinoza was a thoroughgoing [[determinism|determinist]] who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of [[Need|necessity]]. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know that we are determined and to understand ''why'' we act as we do. By forming more "adequate" ideas about what we do and our emotions or [[Affect (philosophy)|affections]], we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This process allows us to become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does.
Therefore, humans have no free will, despite strongly believing that they do. This illusionary perception of freedom stems from human consciousness, experience, and indifference to prior natural causes. Humans think they are free, but they ″dream with their eyes open″. For Spinoza, our actions are guided entirely by natural impulses. In his letter to G. H. Schuller (Letter 58), he wrote: "men are conscious of their desire and unaware of the causes by which [their desires] are determined."&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Pt. I, Prop. XXXVI, Appendix: "[M]en think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire."&lt;/ref&gt;

This picture of Spinoza's determinism is illuminated by this famous quote in ''Ethics'': ″the infant believes that it is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Part III, Proposition 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion. For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are nonexistent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience that we have a false idea of choice predicated upon this.

Spinoza's philosophy has much in common with [[Stoicism]] inasmuch as both philosophies sought to fulfil a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain happiness. Spinoza, however, differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: He utterly rejected their contention that [[reason]] could defeat emotion. On the contrary, he contended, an emotion can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger emotion. For him, the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not. He also held that knowledge of true causes of passive emotion can transform it to an active emotion, thus anticipating one of the key ideas of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]].{{sfn|Scruton|2002|p=86}}

===Ethical philosophy===
Spinoza shared ethical beliefs with ancient Epicureans, in renouncing ethics beyond the material world, although Epicureans focused more on physical pleasure and Spinoza more on emotional wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html|title=Epicurus - Principal Doctrines|first=Vincent|last=Cook|date=|work=Epicurus.net|access-date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encapsulated at the start in his ''Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding'' (''Tractatus de intellectus emendatione'') is the core of Spinoza's ethical philosophy, what he held to be the true and final good. Spinoza held good and evil to be [[relativism|relative]] concepts, claiming that nothing is intrinsically good or bad except relative to a particularity. Things that had classically been seen as good or evil, Spinoza argued, were simply good or bad for humans. Spinoza believes in a deterministic universe in which "All things in nature proceed from certain [definite] necessity and with the utmost perfection." Nothing happens by chance in Spinoza's world, and nothing is [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]].

Given Spinoza's insistence on a completely ordered world where "necessity" reigns, [[Good and evil|Good and Evil]] have no absolute meaning. The world as it exists looks imperfect only because of our limited perception.

===Spinoza's "''Ethics"''===
{{Main article|Ethics (Spinoza)}}
[[File:Spinoza Ethica.jpg|thumb|The opening page of Spinoza's ''magnum opus'', ''Ethics'']]

In the universe anything that happens comes from the essential nature of objects, or of God or Nature. According to Spinoza, reality is perfection. If circumstances are seen as unfortunate it is only because of our inadequate conception of reality. While components of the chain of cause and effect are not beyond the understanding of human reason, human grasp of the infinitely complex whole is limited because of the limits of science to empirically take account of the whole sequence. Spinoza also asserted that sense perception, though practical and useful, is inadequate for discovering truth. His concept of "[[conatus]]" states that human beings' natural inclination is to strive toward preserving an essential being, and asserts that virtue/human power is defined by success in this preservation of being by the guidance of reason as one's central ethical doctrine. According to Spinoza, the highest virtue is the intellectual love or knowledge of God/Nature/Universe.

Also in the "Ethics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedict|title=The Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza discusses his beliefs about what he considers to be the three kinds of knowledge that come with perceptions. The first kind of knowledge he writes about is the knowledge of experiences. More precisely, this first type of knowledge can be known as the knowledge of things that could be "mutilated, confused, and without order."&lt;ref name="Ethics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedict|title=The Ethics|date=1677|chapter=Books 1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation of what the first knowledge can be is that it is the knowledge of dangerous reasoning. Dangerous reason lacks any type of rationality, and causes the mind to be in a "passive" state. This type of "passive mind" that Spinoza writes about in the earlier books of The Ethics is a state of the mind in which adequate causes become passions.
Spinoza’s second knowledge involves reasoning plus emotions. He explains that this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes that have to do with anything common to the human mind. An example of this could be anything that is classified as being of imperfect virtue. Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete. Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue.
Spinoza defines the third and final knowledge as the knowledge of God, which requires rationality and reason of the mind. In more detail, Spinoza uses this type of knowledge to join together the essence of God with the individual essence. This knowledge is also formed from any adequate causes that include perfect virtue.&lt;ref name="Ethics"/&gt;

In the final part of the "[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]", his concern with the meaning of "true blessedness", and his explanation of how emotions must be detached from external causes in order to master them, foreshadow psychological techniques developed in the 1900s. His concept of three types of knowledge—opinion, reason, intuition—and his assertion that intuitive knowledge provides the greatest satisfaction of mind, lead to his proposition that the more we are conscious of ourselves and Nature/Universe, the more perfect and blessed we are (in reality) and that only intuitive knowledge is eternal.

==History of reception==

===Pantheist, panentheist, or atheist?===
{{Main article|Spinozism}}{{see also|Pantheism controversy}}
[[File:Baruch de Spinoza cover portrait.jpg|thumb|right|An unfavorable engraving depiction of philosopher Spinoza, captioned in Latin, "A Jew and an Atheist".]]
It is a widespread belief that Spinoza equated God with the material universe. He has therefore been called the "prophet"&lt;ref&gt;Picton, J. Allanson, "Pantheism: Its Story and Significance", 1905&lt;/ref&gt; and "prince"&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Alexander Campbell "Philosophy of Theism", William Blackwood and Sons, 1895, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; and most eminent expounder of [[pantheism]]. More specifically, in a letter to Henry Oldenburg he states, "as to the view of certain people that I identify God with Nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken".&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence of Benedict de Spinoza, Wilder Publications (26 March 2009), {{ISBN|978-1-60459-156-9}}, letter 73&lt;/ref&gt; For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a ''mode'' under two ''attributes'' of Thought and [[Extension (metaphysics)|Extension]]. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world.

According to German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] (1883–1969), when Spinoza wrote ''{{lang|la|Deus sive Natura}}'' (Latin for 'God or Nature'), Spinoza meant God was ''{{lang|la|[[natura naturans]]}}'' (nature doing what nature does; literally, 'nature naturing'), not ''{{lang|la|[[natura naturata]]}}'' (nature already created; literally, 'nature natured'). Jaspers believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's immanence.&lt;ref name="ts64"&gt;Karl Jaspers, Spinoza (Great Philosophers), Harvest Books (23 October 1974), {{ISBN|978-0-15-684730-8}}, pp. 14, 95&lt;/ref&gt; Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course "divisible"; it has parts. But Spinoza said, "no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided", meaning that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance. He also said, "a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible" (Ethics, Part I, Propositions 12 and 13).&lt;ref name="ts65"&gt;Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (2 October 1996), {{ISBN|978-0-415-10782-2}}, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore, according to Jaspers, the pantheist formula "One and All" would apply to Spinoza only if the "One" preserves its transcendence and the "All" were not interpreted as the totality of finite things.&lt;ref name=ts64/&gt;

[[Martial Guéroult]] (1891–1976) suggested the term "[[panentheism]]", rather than "pantheism" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, "in" God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God.&lt;ref name=ts65/&gt; However, American panentheist philosopher [[Charles Hartshorne]] (1897–2000) insisted on the term [[Classical Pantheism]] to describe Spinoza's view.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

In 1785, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] published a condemnation of Spinoza's pantheism, after [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Gotthold Lessing]] was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a "Spinozist", which was the equivalent in his time of being called an [[atheist]]. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute atheism. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and pantheism. The issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time.

The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late 18th-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:
* the unity of all that exists;
* the regularity of all that happens;
* the identity of spirit and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lange|first1=Frederick Albert|title=History of Materialism and Criticism of its Present Importance, Vol. II|date=1880|publisher=Houghton, Osgood, &amp; Co.|location=Boston|page=147|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmateria02lang|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1879, Spinoza’s pantheism was praised by many, but was considered by some to be alarming and dangerously inimical.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pantheism of Spinoza Dr. Smith regarded as the most dangerous enemy of Christianity, and as he announced his conviction that it had gained the control of the schools, press and pulpit of the Old World [Europe], and was rapidly gaining the same control of the New [United States], his alarm and indignation sometimes rose to the eloquence of genuine passion."

Henry Smith, D.D., LL D., Professor of Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Theology in [[Lane Theological Seminary]], Consisting of Addresses on Occasion of the Anniversary of the Seminary, May 8th, 1879, Together with Commemorative Resolutions'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's "God or Nature" (''Deus sive Natura'') provided a living, natural God, in contrast to [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[first cause argument]] and the dead mechanism of [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]]'s (1709–1751) work, ''[[Man a Machine]]'' (''{{lang|fr|L'homme machine}})''. Coleridge and Shelley saw in Spinoza's philosophy a ''religion of nature''.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; [[Novalis]] called him the "God-intoxicated man".&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws9902&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza inspired the poet Shelley to write his essay "[[The Necessity of Atheism]]".&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt;

Spinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word "God" (Deus) to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. "Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law...."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Thilly, ''A History of Philosophy'', § 47, Holt &amp; Co., New York, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God&lt;ref&gt;"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings." These words were spoken by Albert Einstein, upon being asked if he believed in God by Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the Institutional Synagogue, New York, 24 April 1921, published in the New York Times, 25 April 1929; from ''Einstein: The Life and Times'' Ronald W. Clark, New York: World Publishing Co., 1971, p. 413; also cited as a telegram to a Jewish newspaper, 1929, Einstein Archive 33-272, from Alice Calaprice, ed., ''The Expanded Quotable Einstein'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University&lt;/ref&gt; is the antithesis to the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.

According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Spinoza's God is an "infinite intellect" (''Ethics'' 2p11c) — all knowing (2p3), and capable of loving both himself—and us, insofar as we are part of his perfection (5p35c). And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends ''amor intellectualis dei'' (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1 appendix), and Spinoza insists that "neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God" (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God is really not the kind of being who could ever love us back. "He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return," says Spinoza (5p19).&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pantheism/#Per|title=Pantheism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Nadler]] suggests that settling the question of Spinoza's atheism or pantheism depends on an analysis of attitudes. If pantheism is associated with religiosity, then Spinoza is not a pantheist, since Spinoza believes that the proper stance to take towards God is not one of reverence or religious awe, but instead one of objective study and reason, since taking the religious stance would leave one open to the possibility of error and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#GodNat |title=Baruch Spinoza (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to Eastern philosophies===
Similarities between Spinoza's philosophy and Eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed by many authors. The 19th-century German Sanskritist [[Theodor Goldstücker]] was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the [[Vedanta]] tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was &lt;blockquote&gt;... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Literary Remains of the Late Professor Theodore Goldstucker, W. H. Allen, 1879. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Westminster Review, Volumes 78–79, Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, 1862. p. 1862&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Max Müller]], in his lectures, noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying "the Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'."&lt;ref&gt;Three Lectures on the Vedanta Philosophy. F. Max Muller. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helena Blavatsky]], a founder of the [[Theosophical Society]] also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay "As to Spinoza's Deity—natura naturans—conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity—as natura naturata or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct out-flowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple."&lt;ref&gt;H.P Blavatsky's Collected Writings, Volume 13, pp. 308–10. Quest Books&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinoza's reception in the 19th and 20th centuries===

Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries grew even more interested in Spinoza, often from a left-wing or [[Marxist]] perspective. [[Karl Marx]] liked Spinoza's account of the universe, interpreting it as [[Materialism|materialistic]].&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; The philosophers [[Louis Althusser]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Antonio Negri]] and [[Étienne Balibar]] have each drawn upon Spinoza's philosophy. Deleuze's doctoral thesis, published in 1968, calls him "the prince of philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nietzsche]] esteemed few philosophers, but he esteemed Spinoza.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, "FOURTH DIVISION Concerning the Soul of Artists and Authors", in ''Human, All-Too-Human: Parts One and Two: Pt. I&amp;II'' (Dover Philosophical Classics), Kindle Edition (2012-03-15), Aphorism 157, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, "EIGHTH DIVISION A Glance at the State", in ''Human, All-Too-Human: Parts One and Two: Pt. I&amp;II'' (Dover Philosophical Classics), Kindle Edition (2012-03-15), Aphorism 475, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, "PART I Miscellaneous Maxims and Opinions", in ''Human, All-Too-Human: Parts One and Two: Pt. I&amp;II'' (Dover Philosophical Classics), Kindle Edition (2012-03-15), Aphorism 408, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nietzsche never read Spinoza's works themselves, but learned about Spinoza from [[Kuno Fischer]]'s ''History of Modern Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Urs Sommer]]: Nietzsche’s Readings on Spinoza. A Contextualist Study, Particularly on the Reception of Kuno Fischer, in: ''Journal of Nietzsche Studies'' 43/2 (2012), pp. 156–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[George Santayana]] graduated from college, he published an essay, "The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza", in ''The Harvard Monthly''.&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, "The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza", ''The Harvard Monthly'', 2 (June 1886: 144–52)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he wrote an introduction to ''Spinoza's Ethics and "De intellectus emendatione"''.&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, "Introduction", in ''Spinoza's Ethics and "De intellectus emendatione"''(London: Dent, 1910, vii–xxii)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Santayana was invited to present an essay (published as "Ultimate Religion")&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, "Ultimate Religion", in ''Obiter Scripta'', eds. Justus Buchler and Benjamin Schwartz (New York and London: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1936) 280–97.&lt;/ref&gt; at a meeting at [[The Hague]] celebrating the tricentennial of Spinoza's birth. In Santayana's autobiography, he characterized Spinoza as his "master and model" in understanding the naturalistic basis of morality.&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, ''Persons and Places'' (Cambridge, MA and London: MIT Press, 1986) 233–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinoza's religious criticism and its effect on the philosophy of language===
[[File:Spinoza Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.jpg|right|thumb|''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'']]
Philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] evoked Spinoza with the title (suggested to him by [[G. E. Moore]]) of the English translation of his first definitive philosophical work, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', an allusion to Spinoza's ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]''. Elsewhere, Wittgenstein deliberately borrowed the expression ''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]'' from Spinoza (''Notebooks, 1914-16'', p.&amp;nbsp;83). The structure of his ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' does have some structural affinities with Spinoza's ''Ethics'' (though, admittedly, not with the latter's own ''Tractatus'') in erecting complex philosophical arguments upon basic logical assertions and principles. Furthermore, in propositions 6.4311 and 6.45 he alludes to a Spinozian understanding of eternity and interpretation of the religious concept of eternal life, stating that "If by eternity is understood not eternal temporal duration, but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present." (6.4311) "The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni is its contemplation as a limited whole." (6.45)

[[Leo Strauss]] dedicated his first book, ''Spinoza's Critique of Religion'', to an examination of the latter's ideas. In the book, Strauss identified Spinoza as part of the tradition of Enlightenment rationalism that eventually produced Modernity. Moreover, he identifies Spinoza and his works as the beginning of Jewish Modernity.&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt; More recently [[Jonathan Israel]] argued that, from 1650 to 1750, Spinoza was "the chief challenger of the fundamentals of revealed religion, received ideas, tradition, morality, and what was everywhere regarded, in absolutist and non-absolutist states alike, as divinely constituted political authority."&lt;ref&gt;Israel, J. (2001) Radical Enlightenment; Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650–1750, Oxford, Oxford University Press, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinoza in literature, art, and popular culture===
Spinoza has had influence beyond the confines of philosophy.
*Spinoza's ''Tractatus theologico-politicus'' was presented to the Chair of the Dutch Parliament, and shares a shelf with the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4500/Politiek/article/detail/3282363/2012/07/05/Van-der-Ham-biedt-Verbeet-Spinoza-aan---voor-naast-Bijbel-en-Koran.dhtml |title=Van der Ham biedt Verbeet Spinoza aan |publisher=RTL Nieuws | date=5 July 2012 |accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 17th-century philosopher [[John Locke]], who also spent time in Amsterdam, was influenced by his "pioneering and profound conceptions of religious tolerance and democratic government," according to Cornel West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=West|first1=Cornel|title=The spirit of Spinoza|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/07/28/the_spirit_of_spinoza_cornel_west/|accessdate=6 December 2017|publisher=Boston Globe|date=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 19th-century novelist [[George Eliot]] produced her own translation of the ''Ethics'', the first known English translation of it. Eliot liked Spinoza's vehement attacks on superstition.&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt;
*In his autobiography ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit|From My Life: Poetry and Truth]]'', [[Goethe]] recounts the way in which Spinoza's ''Ethics'' calmed the sometimes unbearable emotional turbulence of his youth. Goethe later displayed his grasp of Spinoza's metaphysics in a fragmentary elucidation of some Spinozist ontological principles entitled ''Study After Spinoza''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textlog.de/41473.html |title=Goethe: Studie nach Spinoza – Aufsätze und Rezensionen |publisher=Textlog.de |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110513034307/http://www.textlog.de/41473.html |archivedate = 13 May 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he cited Spinoza alongside Shakespeare and [[Carl Linnaeus]] as one of the three strongest influences on his life and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_3.html |title=Linné on line – What people have said about Linnaeus |publisher=Linnaeus.uu.se |accessdate=2 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608101238/http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_3.html |archivedate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 20th century novelist [[W. Somerset Maugham]] alluded to one of Spinoza's central concepts with the title of his novel ''[[Of Human Bondage]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*In the early ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[Where No Man Has Gone Before]]", the antagonist, [[Gary Mitchell (Star Trek)|Gary Mitchell]] is seen reading Spinoza, and Mitchell's remark regarding his ease in comprehending Spinoza implies that his intellectual capacity is increasing dramatically. The dialogue indicates that [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] is familiar with Spinoza's work, perhaps as part of his studies at [[Starfleet Academy]].
*In the ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' episode "[[M*A*S*H (season 6)|Fade Out, Fade In, Part 2]]", Major Charles Emerson Winchester, on his exile to Korea, describes himself as someone who "can quote Spinoza from memory".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5el200&lt;/ref&gt;
PBS television series, Jeeves and Wooster (1993) Season 4 Episode 2 has Spinoza as a central part of the plot.  This episode draws on the book Joy in the Morning by PG Wodehouse which also includes Jeeves desire to own a copy of the latest edition of Spinoza’s work.
*[[Albert Einstein]] named Spinoza as the philosopher who exerted the most influence on his [[world view]] (''Weltanschauung''). Spinoza equated God (infinite substance) with Nature, consistent with Einstein's belief in an impersonal deity. In 1929, Einstein was asked in a telegram by [[Herbert S. Goldstein|Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein]] whether he believed in God. Einstein responded by telegram: "I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings."&lt;ref name=tws9903&gt;{{cite news

*Spinoza is an important historical figure in the [[Netherlands]], where his portrait was featured prominently on the Dutch 1000-[[Dutch guilder|guilder]] [[banknote]], [[legal tender]] until the euro was introduced in 2002. The highest and most prestigious scientific award of the Netherlands is named the [[Spinoza Prize|''Spinozaprijs'' (Spinoza prize)]].

*The 2008 play "New Jerusalem", by [[David Ives]], is based on the cherem (ban, shunning, ostracism, expulsion or excommunication) issued against Spinoza by the Talmud Torah congregation in Amsterdam in 1656, and events leading to it.

*In ''Bento's Sketchbook'' (2011), the writer [[John Berger]] combines extracts from Spinoza, sketches, memoir, and observations in a book that contemplates the relationship of materialism to spirituality.

The '''Bechdel test''' ({{IPAc-en|'|b|ɛ|k|d|əl}} {{respell|BEK|dəl}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alison Bechdel Audio Name Pronunciation|url=http://www.teachingbooks.net/pronounce.cgi?aid=10597|website=TeachingBooks.net|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a measure of the representation of women in fiction. It asks whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named is sometimes added.&lt;ref name="savigny et al"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raalte |first1=Christa van |editor1-last=Savigny |editor1-first=Heather |editor2-last=Thorsen |editor2-first=Einar |editor3-last=Jackson |editor3-first=Daniel |editor4-last=Alexander |editor4-first=Jenny |title=Media, Margins and Popular Culture |date=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781137512819 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Er2hCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT32&amp;pg=PT32 |accessdate=10 June 2018 |language=en |chapter=1.

About half of all films meet these criteria, according to user-edited databases and the media industry press.&lt;!-- Please refer to sources cited below, the lead paragraph cites sources only for quotations --&gt; The test is used as an indicator for the active presence of women in films and other fiction, and to call attention to [[gender inequality in fiction]].

Also known as the '''Bechdel–Wallace test''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alison Bechdel Would Like You to Call It the "Bechdel–Wallace Test," ThankYouVeryMuch|url=http://www.themarysue.com/bechdel-wallace-test-please-alison-bechdel/|accessdate=26 August 2015|date=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is named after the American cartoonist [[Alison Bechdel]], in whose comic strip, ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]'', the test first appeared, in 1985. Bechdel credited the idea to a friend, Liz Wallace, and to the writings of [[Virginia Woolf]]. After the test became more widely discussed in the 2000s, a number of variants and tests inspired by it have been introduced.

==History==

===Gender portrayal in popular fiction===
[[File:Female and male characters in film.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Female and male characters in film, according to four studies]]
In her 1929 essay ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]] observed about the literature of her time what the Bechdel test would later highlight in more recent fiction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bechdel-Test: Frauen spielen keine Rolle|url=http://kurier.at/kultur/4506969-bechdel-test-frauen-spielen-keine-rolle.php|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=[[Kurier]]|date=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|All these relationships between women, I thought, rapidly recalling the splendid gallery of fictitious women, are too simple. ... And I tried to remember any case in the course of my reading where two women are represented as friends. ... They are now and then mothers and daughters. But almost without exception they are shown in their relation to men. It was strange to think that all the great women of fiction were, until [[Jane Austen]]'s day, not only seen by the other sex, but seen only in relation to the other sex. And how small a part of a woman's life is that ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolf|first=Virginia|title=A Room of One's Own: Chapter 5|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91r/complete.html|work=[[University of Adelaide#North Terrace|The University of Adelaide Library]]|publisher=[[University of Adelaide Press]]|accessdate=24 December 2012|authorlink=Virginia Woolf|editor=Thomas, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In film, a study of gender portrayals in 855 of the most financially successful U.S. films from 1950 to 2006 showed that there were, on average, two male characters for each female character, a ratio that remained stable over time. Female characters were portrayed as being involved in sex twice as often as male characters, and their proportion of scenes with explicit sexual content increased over time. Violence increased over time in male and female characters alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bleakley | first1 = A. | last2 = Jamieson | first2 = P.

According to a 2014 study by the [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]], in 120 films made worldwide from 2010 to 2013, only 31% of named characters were female, and 23% of the films had a female protagonist or co-protagonist. 7% of directors were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sakoui|first1=Anousha|last2=Magnusson|first2=Niklas|title='Hunger Games' success masks stubborn gender gap in Hollywood|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-wp-blm-news-bc-film-women22-20140922-story.html|accessdate=22 September 2014|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=22 September 2014}} With reference to: {{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Stacy L.|last2=Pieper|first2=Katherine|title=Gender Bias Without Borders: An Investigation of Female Characters in Popular Films Across 11 Countries|url=http://seejane.org/symposiums-on-gender-in-media/gender-bias-without-borders/|website=See Jane|accessdate=16 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study looking at the 700 top‐grossing films from 2007 to 2014 found that only 30% of the speaking characters were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Stacy L.|last2=Choueiti|first2=Marc|last3=Pieper|first3=Katherine|last4=Gillig|first4=Traci|last5=Lee|first5=Carmen|last6=Dylan|first6=DeLuca|title=Inequality in 700 Popular Films: Examining Portrayals of Gender, Race,  &amp; LGBT Status from 2007 to 2014|url=http://annenberg.usc.edu/pages/~/media/MDSCI/Inequality%20in%20700%20Popular%20Films%208215%20Final%20for%20Posting.ashx|publisher=USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 analysis of [[screenplay]]s of 2,005 commercially successful films, Hanah Anderson and Matt Daniels found that in 82% of the films, men had two of the top three speaking roles, while a woman had the most dialogue in only 22% of films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swanson|first1=Ana|title=The problem with almost all movies|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/12/the-problem-with-almost-all-movies/|work=The Washington Post|date=12 April 2016|language=en-US}} With reference to: {{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Hanah|last2=Daniels|first2=Matt|title=The Largest Analysis of Film Dialogue by Gender, Ever|url=http://polygraph.cool/films/|website=Polygraph|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bechdel test===
[[File:Dykes to Watch Out For (Bechdel test origin).jpg|400px|thumb|A character in ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]'' explains the rules that later came to be known as the Bechdel test (1985)]]
The rules now known as the Bechdel test first appeared in 1985 in Alison Bechdel's comic strip ''[[Dykes To Watch Out For]]''. In a strip titled "The Rule", two women, who resemble the future characters Mo and Ginger,&lt;ref name="Martindale"/&gt; discuss seeing a film and one woman explains that she only goes to a movie if it satisfies the following requirements:
# The movie has to have at least two women in it,
# who talk to each other,
# about something besides a man.&lt;ref&gt;Bechdel, Allison. Dykes to Watch Out For. Firebrand Books (October 1, 1986). {{ISBN|978-0932379177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/zizyphus/34585797/in/photostream/ "The Rule" comic page posted on Alison Bechdel's online photostream]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alisonbechdel.blogspot.com/2005/08/rule.html|title=The Rule|author=Alison Bechdel|date=August 16, 2005|publisher=DTWOF: The Blog|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test has also been referred to as the "Bechdel–Wallace test"&lt;ref name="sparqling" /&gt; (which Bechdel herself prefers),&lt;ref&gt;On the [[Fresh Air]] program on NPR on August 17, 2015, in response to a question from host Terry Gross, Bechdel said she would prefer the test be referred to as the Bechdel–Wallace Test.&lt;/ref&gt; the "Bechdel rule",&lt;ref name="ok" /&gt; "Bechdel's law",&lt;ref name="antipope" /&gt; or the "Mo Movie Measure".&lt;ref name=AB/&gt; Bechdel credited the idea for the test to a friend and [[karate]] training partner, Liz Wallace, whose name appears in the [[marquee (sign)|marquee]] of the strip.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94202522 NPR] [[Neda Ulaby|Ulaby, Neda]] "The 'Bechdel Rule,' Defining Pop-Culture Character".

According to [[Neda Ulaby]], the test resonates because "it articulates something often missing in popular culture: not the number of women we see on screen, but the depth of their stories, and the range of their concerns."&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; Dean Spade and Craig Willse described the test as a "commentary on how media representations enforce harmful [[gender norm]]s" by depicting women's relationships to men more than any other relationships, and women's lives as important only insofar as they relate to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Dean |last1=Spade|first2=Craig |last2=Willse|editor-last=Hawkesworth|editor-first=Mary|title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199328581|page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several variants of the test have been proposed—for example, that the two women must be named characters,&lt;ref name="EW 6 August 2010"/&gt; or that there must be at least a total of 60 seconds of conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/02/the-2012-oscars-and-the-bechdel-test/ |title=The Oscars and the Bechdel Test |publisher=Feminist Frequency |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test has also attracted academic interest from a computational analysis approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N15/N15-1084.pdf Bechdel Test academic paper.]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, the Bechdel test was added to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Suh |first1=Haley |title=Words To Know By Now: Binge-Watching, Bechdel Test Added To Oxford English Dictionary |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/haleysuh/2018/06/15/words-to-know-by-now-binge-watching-bechdel-test-added-to-oxford-english-dictionary |accessdate=20 June 2018 |work=Forbes |date=15 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in the film industry===
In 2013, four Swedish cinemas and the Scandinavian cable television channel [[Viasat Film]] incorporated the Bechdel test into some of their ratings, a move supported by the [[Swedish Film Institute]].&lt;ref name="G"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/swedish-cinemas-bechdel-test-films-gender-bias |title=Swedish cinemas take aim at gender bias with Bechdel test rating |work=The Guardian |date=November 6, 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the European cinema fund [[Eurimages]] incorporated the Bechdel test into its submission mechanism as part of an effort to collect information about gender equality in its projects. It requires "a Bechdel analysis of the script to be supplied by the script readers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender equality within Eurimages: current situation and scope for evolution|url=http://www.ewawomen.com/en/eurimages-news.html|website=European Women's Audiovisual Network|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[screenwriting software]] developers began incorporating functions that allow writers to analyze their scripts for gender representation. Software with such functions includes [[Highland 2]], [[WriterDuet]] and the forthcoming [[Final Draft (software)|Final Draft]] 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ryzik |first1=Melena |title=Is your script gender-balanced?

==Application==

In addition to films, the Bechdel test has been applied to other media such as video games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Kishonna|title=Race, Gender, and Deviance in Xbox Live: Theoretical Perspectives from the Virtual Margins|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317521803|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh-gBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anthropy |first=Anna |title=Rise of the videogame zinesters: How freaks, normals, amateurs, artists, dreamers, dropouts, queers, housewives, and people like you are taking back an art form |year=2012 |publisher=Seven Stories Press |isbn=9781609803735 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nc3GRXqgPZ8C&amp;lpg=PT7 |edition=Seven Stories Press 1st |accessdate=2014-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Agnello |first=Anthony John |title=Something other than a man: 15 games that pass the Bechdel Test |url=http://gameological.com/2012/07/something-other-than-a-man-15-games-that-pass-the-bechdel-test/ |accessdate=26 July 2012 |work=Gameological |date=July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and comics.&lt;ref name="MTV Geek! 22 February 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zalben |first=Alex |title=''Witchblade''/''Red Sonja #1'' Passes The Bechdel Test |url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/02/22/witchbladered-sonja-1-passes-the-bechdel-test-advance-review/ |accessdate=26 July 2012 |newspaper=[[MTV Geek!]] |date=22 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In theater, British actor Beth Watson launched a "Bechdel Theatre" campaign in 2015 that aims to highlight test-passing plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jo Caird|title = Does your show pass the Bechdel test? {{!}} Opinion |url = https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/2015/does-your-show-pass-the-bechdel-test/|website = The Stage|date=14 October 2015|access-date = 2016-02-05|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pass and fail proportions===
The website ''bechdeltest.com'' is a user-edited database of some 6,500 films classified by whether they pass the test, with the added requirement that the women must be ''named'' characters. {{as of|April 2015}}, it listed 58% of these films as passing all three of the test's requirements, 10% as failing one, 22% as failing two, and 10% as failing all three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statistics |url=http://bechdeltest.com/statistics/ |work=bechdeltest.com |accessdate=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', if passing the test were mandatory, it would have jeopardized half of the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] nominees.&lt;ref name="EW 6 August 2010"&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Mark |title=I Am Woman. Hear Me... Please! |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20408121,00.html |accessdate=26 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=6 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The news website ''[[Vocativ]]'', when subjecting the top-grossing films of 2013 to the Bechdel test, concluded that roughly half of them passed (although some dubiously) and the other half failed.&lt;ref name="Vocativ 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Sharma |first1= Versha |last2= Sender |first2= Hanna |title= Hollywood Movies With Strong Female Roles Make More Money |url= http://www.vocativ.com/culture/celebrity/hollywood-movies-strong-female-roles-make-money/ |accessdate= 2 January 2014 |newspaper= Vocativ |date= 2 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Charles Stross]] noted that about half of the films that ''do'' pass the test only do so because the women talk about marriage or babies.&lt;ref name="Power 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Power |first=Nina |title=One-dimensional woman |year=2009 |publisher=Zero Books |isbn=1846942411 |pages=39 et seq. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3gDWJEJblEC&amp;pg=PA39 |accessdate=2014-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Works that fail the test include some that are mainly about or aimed at women, or which do feature prominent female characters. The television series ''[[Sex and the City]]'' highlights its own failure to pass the test by having one of the four female main characters ask: "How does it happen that four such smart women have nothing to talk about but boyfriends? It's like seventh grade with bank accounts!"&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;

===Financial aspects===
''Vocativ''{{'}}s authors also found that the films from 2013 that passed the test earned a total of $4.22 billion in the United States, while those that failed earned $2.66 billion in total, leading them to conclude that a way for Hollywood to make more money might be to "put more women onscreen."&lt;ref name="Vocativ 2014"/&gt; A 2014 study by [[FiveThirtyEight]] based on data from about 1,615 films released from 1990 to 2013 concluded that the [[median]] budget of films that passed the test was 35% lower than that of the others. It found that the films that passed the test had about a 37 percent higher [[return on investment]] (ROI) in the United States, and the same ROI internationally, compared to films that did not pass the test.&lt;ref name="538 2014"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= FiveThirtyEight |first= Walt |last= Hickey |title= The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood's Exclusion of Women |date= 1 April 2014 |url= http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explanations===
Explanations that have been offered as to why many films fail the Bechdel test include the relative lack of gender [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among scriptwriters&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; and other movie professionals, also called the "[[celluloid ceiling]]": In 2012, only one in six of the directors, writers, and producers behind the 100 most commercially successful movies in the United States was a woman.&lt;ref name="Metro 18 July 2013" /&gt;

Writing in ''[[National Review]]'' in 2017, film critic [[Kyle Smith]] suggested that the reason for the Bechdel test results was that "Hollywood movies are about people on the extremes of society — cops, criminals, superheroes — [which] tend to be men", and that such films were more often created by men because "women's movie ideas", mostly about relationships according to Smith, "aren't commercial enough for Hollywood studios".&lt;ref name="Smith 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Kyle|title=If You Like Art, Don’t Take the Bechdel Test|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449340/bechdel-test-feminist-litmus-test-movies-useless-political-correctness|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=National Review|date=10 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the Bechdel test just as meaningless as a test asking whether a film contained [[cowboy]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith 2017" /&gt; Smith's article provoked vigorous criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gettell|first1=Oliver|title=Conservative Film Critic Slammed for Bechdel Test Takedown|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/10/kyle-smith-slammed-bechdel-test-takedown/|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=[[EW.com]]|date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alessandra Maldonado and Liz Bourke wrote that Smith was wrong to contend that female authors do not write books that generate "big movie ideas", citing [[J.

== Limitations ==
The Bechdel test only indicates whether women are present in a work of fiction to a certain degree. A work may pass the test and still contain sexist content, and a work with prominent female characters may fail the test.&lt;ref name="ok"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oudaily.com/l_and_a/arts_and_entertainment/column-bechdel-rule-still-applies-to-portrayal-of-women-in/article_d3dc6a7d-8fcb-589c-885a-649fe33db5e1.html |first=Sarah |last=Wilson |date=28 June 2012 |publisher=The Oklahoma Daily |title=Bechdel Rule still applies to portrayal of women in films}}&lt;/ref&gt; A work may fail the test for reasons unrelated to gender bias, such as because its setting works against the inclusion of women (e.g., [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose (film)|The Name of the Rose]]'', set in a medieval monastery).&lt;ref name="antipope"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stross|first=Charles|title=Bechdel's Law|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2008/07/bechdels_law.html|work=Charlie's Diary|date=28 July 2008|authorlink=Charles Stross|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; What counts as a character or as a conversation is not defined (e.g., the [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]] song "[[Baby Got Back]]" has been described as passing the Bechdel test, because it begins with audio of a [[valley girl]] saying "oh my god, Becky, look at her butt")&lt;ref name=LifehackerDouglas&gt;[https://lifehacker.com/the-bechdel-test-and-other-media-representation-tests-1819324045 The Bechdel Test, and Other Media Representation Tests, Explained], by Nick Douglas, at ''[[Lifehacker]]''; published October 10, 2017; retrieved April 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JezebelSimulator&gt;[https://jezebel.com/this-bechdel-test-simulator-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-pre-1753250185 This Bechdel Test Simulator Shows How Easy It Is to Predict Who Makes Sexist Movies (Men)], by Kara Brown, at ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]''; published January 15, 2016; retrieved April 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and works with very few of either will often fail the test automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gomez Maureira |first1=M.A.|last2=Rombout|first2=L.E.|editor1-last=Chorianopoulos|editor1-first=Konstantinos|title=Entertainment Computing - ICEC 2015: 14th International Conference, ICEC 2015, Trondheim, Norway, September 29 - October 2, 2015, Proceedings|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319245898|page=546|chapter=Sonifying Gender Representation in Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt at a [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] analysis of works as to whether they pass the test, at least one researcher, Faith Lawrence, noted that the results depend on how rigorously the test is applied. One of the questions arising from its application is whether a reference to a man at any point within a conversation that also covers other topics invalidates the entire exchange. If not, the question remains how one defines the start and end of a conversation.&lt;ref name="sparqling"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Faith|title=SPARQLing Conversation: Automating The Bechdel–Wallace Test|url=http://nht.ecs.soton.ac.uk/2011/papers/12-flawrence.pdf|date=June 2011|work=Paper presented at the Narrative and Hypertext Workshop, Hypertext 2011|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In response to its increasing ubiquity in film criticism, the Bechdel test has been criticized for not taking into account the quality of the works it tests (bad films may pass it, and good ones fail), or as a "nefarious plot to make all movies conform to [[feminist]] dogma".&lt;ref name="Zeisler 2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=We Were Feminists Once: From Riot Grrrl to CoverGirl¨, the Buying and Selling of a Political Movement|date=2016|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781610395892|pages=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Andi Zeisler]], this criticism indicates the problem that the test's utility "has been elevated way beyond the original intention. Where Bechdel and Wallace expressed it as simply a way to point out the rote, unthinkingly normative plotlines of mainstream film, these days passing it has somehow become synonymous with 'being feminist'. It was never meant to be a measure of feminism, but rather a cultural barometer." Zeisler noted that the false assumption that a work that passes the test is "feminist" might lead to creators "gaming the system" by adding just enough women characters and dialogue to pass the test,&lt;ref name="Zeisler 2016" /&gt; while continuing to deny women substantial representation outside of formulaic plots.

Similarly, the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' film critic [[Robbie Collin]] disapproved of the test as prizing "box-ticking and stat-hoarding over analysis and appreciation", and suggested that the underlying problem of the lack of well-drawn female characters in film ought to be a topic of discourse, rather than individual films failing or passing the Bechdel test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collin|first=Robbie|title=Bechdel test is damaging to the way we think about film|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10450463/Bechdel-test-is-damaging-to-the-way-we-think-about-film.html|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''FiveThirtyEight''{{'}}s writer Walt Hickey noted that the test does not measure whether any one film is a model of gender equality, and that passing it does not ensure the quality of writing, significance or depth of female roles—but, he wrote, "it's the best test on gender equity in film we have—and, perhaps more important ..., the only test we have data on".&lt;ref name="538 2014" /&gt;

[[Nina Power]] wrote that the test raises the questions of whether fiction has a duty to represent women (rather than to pursue whatever the creator's own agenda might be) and to be "realistic" in the representation of women. She also wrote that it remained to be determined how often real life passes the Bechdel test, and what the influence of fiction on that might be.&lt;ref name="Power 2009" /&gt;

It asks: Does the film contain a character that is identifiably LGBT, and is not solely or predominantly defined by their sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as tied into the plot in such a way that their removal would have a significant effect?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GLAAD introduces 'Studio Responsibility Index', report on LGBT images in films released by 'Big Six' studios |url=http://www.glaad.org/releases/glaad-introduces-studio-responsibility-index-report-lgbt-images-films-released-big-six |date=August 20, 2013 |publisher=[[GLAAD]] |accessdate=August 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Atlantic 21 August 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=John|first=Arit|title=Beyond the Bechdel Test: Two (New) Ways of Looking at Movies|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2013/08/beyond-bechdel-test-two-new-ways-looking-movies/68563/|accessdate=15 September 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====People of color====
A test proposed by TV critic Eric Deggans asks whether a film that is not about race has at least two non-white characters in the main cast,&lt;ref name="Zeisler 2016" /&gt; and similarly, writer Nikesh Shukla proposed a test about whether there are two main characters who are [[people of color]], who talk to each other without mentioning their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shukla|first1=Nikesh|title=After the Bechdel Test, I propose the Shukla Test for race in film|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/after-bechdel-test-i-propose-shukla-test-race-film|accessdate=22 November 2016|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawn|first1=Randee|title=Gender and race issues are slowly fading as more filmmakers consider three key tests|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-1117-film-tests-20161011-snap-20161109-story.html|accessdate=22 November 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' film critic [[Manohla Dargis]] suggested in January 2016 the "DuVernay test", (named for director [[Ava DuVernay]]) asking whether "African-Americans and other minorities have fully realized lives rather than serve as scenery in white stories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dargis|first1=Manohla|title=Sundance Fights Tide With Films Like ‘The Birth of a Nation’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/movies/sundance-fights-tide-with-films-like-the-birth-of-a-nation.html|accessdate=4 February 2018|work=The New York Times|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to point out the lack of people of color in [[Hollywood]] [[movie]]s, through a measure of their importance to a particular movie or the lack of a gratuitous link to white actors.&lt;ref name="2016-02-01_TC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/could-this-be-the-bechdel-test-for-race.html|title=Could This Be the Bechdel Test for Race|accessdate=February 4, 2018|last=Evans|first=Dayna|date=February 1, 2016|work=The Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadia Latif and Leila Latif of ''[[The Guardian]]'' have suggested a series of five questions:
* Are there two named characters of color?
* Do they have dialogue?
* Are they not romantically involved with one another?
* Do they have any dialogue that isn't comforting or supporting a white character?
* Is one of them definitely not [[Magical Negro|magic]]?&lt;ref name="2016-01-19_NL-LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/18/hollywoods-race-problem-film-industry-actors-of-colour|title=How to fix Hollywood's race problem|accessdate=June 20, 2017|last1=Latif|last2=Latif|first1=Nadia|first2=Leila|date=January 18, 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplified version by Nikesh Shukla, already proposed in 2013, asks if "two ethnic minorities talk to each other for more than five minutes about something other than race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shukla|first=Nikesh|title=After the Bechdel Test, I propose the Shukla Test for race in film|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/after-bechdel-test-i-propose-shukla-test-race-film|accessdate=November 22, 2016|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tests about nonfiction===
The Bechdel test has also inspired gender-related tests for nonfiction. Laurie Voss, [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] of [[npm (software)|npm]], proposed a Bechdel test for software. [[Source code]] passes this test if it contains a function written by a woman developer which calls a function written by a different woman developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=seldo |author=Laurie Voss |number=571453200093437952 |date=27 Feb 2015 |title=Does your project pass the Bechdel test?

The Bechdel test also inspired the [[Finkbeiner test]], a checklist to help journalists to avoid gender bias in articles about [[women in science]].&lt;ref name="CJR 22 March 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Brainard |first=Curtis |title='The Finkbeiner Test' Seven rules to avoid gratuitous gender profiles of female scientists |url=http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/finkbeiner_test_gender_gap_fem.php?page=all |accessdate=31 March 2013 |newspaper=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |date=22 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fort Lee lane closure scandal ==
{{main|Fort Lee lane closure scandal}}

On November 4, 2016, Kelly was found guilty in connection with the four-day closures of entrance ramps to the [[George Washington Bridge]] in the late summer of 2013, in part of what has been described as politically motivated retribution against the mayor of [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=zernicke&gt;{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Zernike |authorlink=Kate Zernike |title=Christie Faces Scandal on Traffic Jam Aides Ordered |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/nyregion/christie-aide-tied-to-bridge-lane-closings.html |quote='Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' Bridget Anne Kelly, a deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie, e-mailed David Wildstein, ... who worked at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the bridge. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 8, 2014 |accessdate=January 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2013, Kelly sent an eight-word e-mail to [[David Wildstein]], a Christie appointee to the [[board of commissioners]] of the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], that read, "Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/bridget-anne-kelly|title=Meet the Christie Aide Behind the Instantly Infamous 'Traffic Problems' Email|last=Lach|first=Eric|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2014|publisher=Talking Point Memo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildstein responded to Kelly's e-mail: "Got it."  In a texting exchange the next day, Wildstein relayed to Kelly a text from Fort Lee Mayor [[Mark Sokolich]] in which he complained about the traffic jam and said, "The bigger problem is getting kids to school. Please help. It's maddening." Kelly replied, "Is it wrong that I'm smiling?"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/02/bridge_scandal_david_wildstein_uncensored_documents.html NJ.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2014, after the emails were disclosed, the governor announced that he had fired Kelly, calling her action "stupid" and "deceitful" and claiming her actions had caused him to mislead the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/nyregion/christie-controversy-bridge-lane-closings.html?hp|title=Christie Fires Aide in Bridge Scandal as U.S. Opens Inquiry |last1=Santora | first1=Marc |last2=Rashbaum |first2=William |date=January 9, 2014 |accessdate=January 11, 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day, Kelly was named as a defendant in a federal [[class action]] [[lawsuit]] in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey]] that cited a [[Conspiracy (civil)|civil conspiracy]] and "willful, wanton, arbitrary, and egregious [[official misconduct]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Markos |first=Kibret |date=January 9, 2014 | url=http://www.northjersey.com/fortlee/Six_Bergen_County_residents_file_class-action_lawsuits_against_Christie.html| title=Six Bergen County residents file class-action lawsuits over GWB scandal|work=The Record |accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Complaint, docket entry 1, Jan. 9, 2014, ''Zachary Galicki, et al. v.

"Across the borough at Kelly's light brown house, which also now has two "No trespassing" signs on the lawn, vehicles cannot park along Wyckoff Avenue, a main road where parking has always been banned."&lt;/ref&gt;

When she received subpoenas for documents from the New Jersey legislative committee, Kelly's attorneys indicated she would not comply with the subpoenas, citing their clients' [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment right]] against [[self-incrimination]] and [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment right]] against unreasonable [[search and seizure]]&lt;ref name="Stepien lawyer objects"&gt;{{cite news   | last = Grant   | first = Jason   | title = Bill Stepien's lawyer objects to legislative subpoena in bridge scandal, requests its withdrawal   | publisher = The Star-Ledger   | date = January 31, 2014    | url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/01/bill_stepiens_lawyer_objects_to_legislative_subpoena_in_bridge_scandal_request_subpeona_withdraw.html   | accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stepien lawyer invokes fifth"&gt;{{cite news   | title = Attorney says longtime Christie adviser Bill Stepien will invoke Fifth Amendment   | publisher = The Washington Post   | date = January 31, 2014   | url = https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/letter-from-attorney-of-longtime-christie-adviser-bill-stepien-invoking-fifth-amendment/790/   | accessdate=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee voted to compel Kelly to produce the previously requested documents, instructing special counsel Reid Schar to "take all necessary steps" to enforce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Baxter   | first = Christopher   | title = Panel investigating Chris Christie bridge scandal votes to compel insiders to produce records   | publisher = The Star-Ledger   | date = February 10, 2014   | url = http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/02/panel_investigating_chris_christie_bridge_scandal_issues_xx_new_subpoenas.html#incart_river_default   | accessdate = February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson found no basis to force Kelly and Bill Stepien, the governor's two-time campaign manager, to comply with the subpoenas. The pair had objected to the requests, issued in January, asserting that being forced to identify and turn over records would violate their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. They called the committee's requests a [[fishing expedition]]. The Court agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Baxter, "NJ judge rules against bridge scandal panel in subpoena fight," April 9, 2014, ''Star-Ledger'', reproduced by NJ.com, accessed August 27, 2014, at [http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/04/nj_judge_rules_against_bridge_scandal_panel_in_subpoena_fight.html#incart_m-rpt-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

To give a '''bum steer''' is a predominantly Australian, New Zealand and North American idiom that means to provide information, intentionally or unintentionally,&lt;ref&gt;p.468, Urdang&lt;/ref&gt;  that is incorrect,&lt;ref&gt;for example, p.137, Kitching&lt;/ref&gt; was unhelpful, or caused one to be led astray.  The phrase is not generally regarded as [[pejorative]].  The idiom, as used in Australia and New Zealand, reached the United States in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;p.125, Barnhart, Steinmetz&lt;/ref&gt; probably after exposure to Australian troops on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]], and is recorded in the UK since 1944.&lt;ref&gt;p.32, Fergusson, Partridge, Beale&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bum Steer.jpg|thumb|Sailors often misheard directions when attempting to steer the
ship in reverse due to differing nationalities assigned to the ship.
]]
Its origin is possibly from 19th century American maritime humour and the difficulty of trying to steer a vessel in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;p.1619, The Chambers Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;  A ship's stern is flat and lacks the pointed structure of a [[Bow (ship)|bow]], and a ship is therefore difficult to maneuver in reverse when using the [[rudder]], also found on the stern.&lt;ref&gt;p.73, Day&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse maneuvering was accomplished therefore through shouted instructions from the wharf to the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]], via intermediary deckhands.  Such communication  was prone to misunderstanding owing to the wide variety of nationalities employed on United States merchant vessels during the 19th century.

[[File:A calm by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|right|''A Calm'', by [[James Gillray]]]]
[[File:Abbot of Watkungtaphao in Phu Soidao Waterfall.jpg|thumb|200px|Doing [[meditation]] could help people be in a calm state.]]
'''Calmness''' is the mental state of [[Inner peace|peace of mind]] being free from agitation, excitement, or disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/calmness|title=Calm – Definition of Calm by Merriam-Webster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers being in a state of serenity, tranquillity, or peace.&lt;ref name="a1" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Calmness|title=Calmness – definition of calmness by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calmness can most easily occur for the average person during a state of relaxation, but it can also be found during much more alert and aware states.{{CN|date=December 2017}} Some people find that focusing the mind on something external, or even internal, such as the breathing, can itself be very calming.

Calmness is a quality that can be cultivated and increased with practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simoleonsense.com/the-psychology-of-cool-calm-collected/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513144845/http://www.simoleonsense.com/the-psychology-of-cool-calm-collected/ |archivedate=May 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually takes a trained mind to stay calm in the face of a great deal of different stimulation, and possible distractions, especially emotional ones. The negative emotions are the greatest challenge to someone who is attempting to cultivate a calm mind. Some disciplines that promote and develop calmness are [[prayer]], [[yoga]], [[relaxation training]], breath training, and [[meditation]]. [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] states that “Concentration is a cornerstone of mindfulness practice. Your mindfulness will only be as robust as the capacity of your mind to be calm and stable. Without calmness, the mirror of mindfulness will have an agitated and choppy surface and will not be able to reflect things with any accuracy.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/calmness|title=Quotes About Calmness|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another term usually associated with calmness is "Peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/calmness?show=0&amp;t=1303344553|title=Calmness Synonyms, Calmness Antonyms – Merriam-Webster Thesaurus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mind that is at peace or calm will cause the brain to produce "good" hormones, which in turn give the person a stable emotional state and promote good health in every area of life, including [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=98658&amp;page=2|title=Study: Bad Hormones Lead to Bad Marriages|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the rise in crime and diseases around the world which are more often than not the consequences of the emotions going 'out-of-control',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/topics/anger/control.aspx#|title=Controlling Anger — Before It Controls You|work=apa.org|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is therefore considered beneficial for many to stay calm and cultivate it in every possible situation, especially during stressful events such as demise of a family member or failure in business.

==Etymology==
The term comes from [[Middle English]] calme, from [[Old French]], from [[Old Italian]] calmo, from [[Late Latin]] cauma, "heat of the day", the "resting place in the heat of the day", from Greek kauma, burning heat, from kaiein, to burn.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

In [[media studies]], '''concision''' is a form of [[broadcast media]] [[censorship]] by limiting debate and discussion of important topics on the rationale of time allotment.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://users.utu.fi/bredelli/C8.htm Finnish Views of CNN, Chapter 8: The Structural Constraint of "Concision" as it is Used in the Discourse Style of American Commercial Broadcasting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423095239/http://users.utu.fi/bredelli/C8.htm |date=2012-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media critics such as [[Noam Chomsky]] contend that this practice, especially on commercial broadcasts with [[advertising]], encourages broadcasters to exclude people and ideas that they judge cannot conform to the time limits of a particular program.  This leads to a limited number of "the usual suspects" who will say expected ideas that will not require extensive explanation such as mainstream political ones.


'''The beauty of concision, you know, saying a couple sentences between two commercials, the beauty of that is you can only repeat conventional thoughts. Suppose I go on Nightline, whatever it is, two minutes, and I say Gaddafi is a terrorist, Khomeini is a murderer etcetera etcetera…I don’t need any evidence, everyone just nods. On the other hand, suppose you’re saying something that isn’t just regurgitating conventional pieties, suppose you say something that’s the least bit unexpected or controversial, people will quite reasonably expect to know what you mean. If you said that you’d better have a reason, better have some evidence. You can’t give evidence if you’re stuck with concision. That’s the genius of this structural constraint.'''&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;[https://ohtarzie.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/greenwald-on-chomsky-and-staying-in-the-mainstream-without-compromise/  Greenwald on Chomsky and Staying In the Mainstream Without Compromise]{{cite web |url=https://ohtarzie.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/greenwald-on-chomsky-and-staying-in-the-mainstream-without-compromise/}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, introducing controversial or unexpected statements that do not conform to those conventional ideas are discouraged as time inefficient because the person will be required to explain and support them in detail.  Since this can often take considerable time in itself and digress from the primary discussion topic of the broadcast, this is discouraged.  Alternatively, the explanation could be subject to extensive editing for time which could lead to an inadequate presentation of the subject's thoughts.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

==Illustration==

This media control idea is illustrated in the [[film documentary]], ''[[Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media]]'', where journalist [[Jeff Greenfield]] explains why a person like Chomsky may be excluded from being interviewed on air because he takes too long to warm up. The film then follows up with Chomsky himself explaining the concept while the film gives examples of controversial statements he has made in the past that would require extensive explanation in an interview.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

The 1999 feature film ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' has a dramatization of the media concept where journalist [[Mike Wallace]] goes public on a news show about the censoring of a controversial story on ''[[60 Minutes]]''.  When Wallace sees his interview broadcast, he is furious that his testimony is limited to a curt statement that does not adequately explain his position and the only excuse from the producers he receives is that it had to be cut for time.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

'''Conscience''' is a cognitive process that elicits emotion and rational associations based on an individual's [[ethics|moral philosophy]] or value system. Conscience stands in contrast to elicited emotion or thought due to associations based on immediate sensory perceptions and reflexive responses, as in sympathetic CNS responses.  In common terms, conscience is often described as leading to feelings of [[remorse]] when a person commits an act that conflicts with their [[moral value]]s. An individual's moral values and their dissonance with familial, social, cultural and historical interpretations of moral philosophy are considered in the examination of [[cultural relativism|cultural relativity]] in both the practice and study of psychology.  The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such [[moral judgment]]s are or should be based on [[reason]] has occasioned debate through much of modern history between theories of modern [[western philosophy]] in juxtaposition to the theories of [[romanticism]] and other reactionary movements after the end of the [[Middle Ages]].

Religious views of conscience usually see it as linked to a morality inherent in all humans, to a beneficent universe and/or to [[divinity]]. The diverse ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, institutional and material features of religion may not necessarily cohere with experiential, emotive, [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[contemplative]] considerations about the origin and operation of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. pp. 10–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Common [[secular]] or [[scientific]] views regard the capacity for conscience as probably [[genetics|genetically determined]], with its subject probably learned or [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] as part of a [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Winch. ''Moral Integrity''. Basil Blackwell. Oxford. 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly used metaphors for conscience include the "voice within", the "inner light",&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Rosemary Moore. ''The Light in Their Consciences: The Early Quakers in Britain 1646–1666''. Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, PA. 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-271-01988-8}},&lt;/ref&gt; or even Socrates' reliance on what the Greeks called his "[[Daemon (classical mythology)#Socrates|daimōnic]] sign", an averting (ἀποτρεπτικός ''apotreptikos'') inner voice heard only when he was about to make a mistake. Conscience, as is detailed in sections below, is a concept in national and international law,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1948"&gt;United Nations. [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], G.A. res. 217A (III), U.N. Doc A/810 at 71 (1948). http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ accessed 22 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is increasingly conceived of as applying to the world as a whole,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;Booth K, Dunne T and Cox M (eds).

[[File:SeatedBuddhaGandhara2ndCenturyOstasiatischeMuseum.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Seated [[Buddha]], [[Gandhara]], 2nd century CE. The Buddha linked conscience with compassion for those who must endure cravings and suffering in the world until right conduct culminates in right mindfulness and right contemplation.]]

In the literary traditions of the [[Upanishads]], [[Brahma Sutras]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]], conscience is the label given to attributes composing knowledge about good and evil, that a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] acquires from the completion of acts and consequent accretion of [[karma]] over many lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Adi Shankara]] in his ''[[Vivekachudamani]]'' morally right action (characterised as humbly and compassionately performing the primary duty of good to others without expectation of material or spiritual reward), helps "purify the heart" and provide mental tranquility but it alone does not give us "direct perception of the Reality".&lt;ref&gt;Shankara. ''Crest-Jewel of Discrimination'' (''[[Vivekachudamani|Veka-Chudamani]]'') (trans Prabhavananda S and Isherwood C). Vedanta Press, Hollywood. 1978. pp. 34–36, 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge requires discrimination between the eternal and non-eternal and eventually a realization in [[contemplation]] that the true self merges in a universe of pure consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Shankara. ''Crest-Jewel of Discrimination'' (''[[Vivekachudamani|Veka-Chudamani]]'') (trans Prabhavananda S and Isherwood C). Vedanta Press, Hollywood. 1978. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Zoroastrian]] faith, after death a soul must face judgment at the ''Bridge of the Separator''; there, [[evil]] people are tormented by prior denial of their own higher nature, or conscience, and "to all time will they be guests for the ''House of the Lie''."&lt;ref&gt;John B Noss. ''Man's Religions''. Macmillan. New York. 1968. p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[China|Chinese]] concept of [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]], indicates that conscience, along with social etiquette and correct relationships, assist humans to follow ''The Way'' ([[Tao]]) a mode of life reflecting the implicit human capacity for goodness and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;AS Cua. ''Moral Vision and Tradition: Essays in Chinese Ethics''. Catholic University of America Press. Washington. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bronze Marcus Aurelius Louvre Br45.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marcus Aurelius]] bronze fragment, Louvre, Paris: "To move from one unselfish action to another with God in mind. Only there, delight and stillness."]]
Conscience also features prominently in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Hoose (ed) ''Conscience in World Religions''. University of Notre Dame Press. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pali]] scriptures, for example, [[Buddha]] links the positive aspect of ''conscience'' to a pure heart and a calm, well-directed mind. It is regarded as a spiritual power, and one of the “Guardians of the World”. The Buddha also associated conscience with compassion for those who must endure cravings and suffering in the world until right conduct culminates in right mindfulness and right [[contemplation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The Religious Experience of Mankind''. Fontana. 1971 p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Santideva]] (685–763 CE) wrote in the [[Bodhicaryavatara]] (which he composed and delivered in the great northern Indian Buddhist university of [[Nalanda]]) of the spiritual importance of perfecting virtues such as [[generosity]], [[forbearance]] and training the awareness to be like a "block of wood" when attracted by vices such as [[pride]] or [[lust]]; so one can continue advancing towards right understanding in meditative absorption.&lt;ref&gt;Santideva. ''The Bodhicaryavatara''. trans Crosby K and Skilton A. Oxford University Press, Oxford. 1995. pp. 38, 98&lt;/ref&gt; ''Conscience'' thus manifests in Buddhism as unselfish love for all living beings which gradually intensifies and awakens to a purer awareness&lt;ref&gt;Lama Anagarika Govinda in Jeffery Paine (ed) ''Adventures with the Buddha: A Buddhism Reader''. WW Norton. London. pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; where the mind withdraws from sensory interests and becomes aware of itself as a single whole.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ajahn Thate]]. Steps Along the Path. Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans) Theravada Library 1994. http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/thate/stepsalong.html (last accessed 11 May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] wrote in his ''[[Meditations]]'' that conscience was the human capacity to live by rational principles that were congruent with the true, tranquil and harmonious nature of our mind and thereby that of the Universe: "To move from one unselfish action to another with God in mind. Only there, delight and stillness&amp;nbsp;... the only rewards of our existence here are an unstained character and unselfish acts."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius. ''Meditations''. Gregory Hays (trans). Weidenfeld and &amp; Nicolson. London. 2003 pp. 70, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghazali's crisis of epistemological skepticism was resolved by "a light which God Most High cast into my breast&amp;nbsp;... the key to most knowledge."]]

The [[Islamic]] concept of ''[[Taqwa]]'' is closely related to conscience. In the [[Qur’ān]] verses 2:197 &amp; 22:37 Taqwa refers to "right conduct" or "[[piety]]", "guarding of oneself" or "guarding against evil".&lt;ref&gt;Sachiko Murata and William C. Chittick. ''The Vision of Islam''. I. B.

[[Qur’ān]] verse 49:13 states: "O humankind! We have created you out of male and female and constituted you into different groups and societies, so that you may come to know each other-the noblest of you, in the sight of God, are the ones possessing taqwā." In [[Islam]], according to eminent theologians such as [[Al-Ghazali]], although events are ordained (and written by God in al-Lawh al-Mahfūz, the ''Preserved Tablet''), humans possess free will to choose between wrong and right, and are thus responsible for their actions; the conscience being a dynamic personal connection to God enhanced by knowledge and practise of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], deeds of piety, repentance, self-discipline and prayer; and disintegrated and metaphorically covered in blackness through sinful acts.&lt;ref&gt;John B Noss.

In the Protestant Christian tradition, [[Martin Luther]] insisted in the [[Diet of Worms]] that his conscience was captive to the Word of God, and it was neither safe nor right to go against conscience. To Luther, conscience falls within the ethical, rather than the religious, sphere.&lt;ref name=Tillich&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tillich|first1=Paul|title=Morality and Beyond|date=1963|publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|location=New York|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Calvin]] saw conscience as a battleground: "[...] the enemies who rise up in our conscience against his Kingdom and hinder his decrees prove that God's throne is not firmly established therein".&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian religion'', Book 2, chapter 8, quoted in:{{cite book |last= Wogaman |first= J.

''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamentalist Christian view of conscience might be: 'God gave us our conscience so we would know when we break His Law; the guilt we feel when we do something wrong tells us that we need to repent.'&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; This can sometimes (as with the conflict between [[William Tyndale]] and [[Thomas More]] over the translation of the Bible into English) lead to moral quandaries: "Do I unreservedly obey my Church/priest/military/political leader or do I follow my own inner feeling of right and wrong as instructed by prayer and a personal reading of scripture?"&lt;ref&gt;Brian Moynahan. ''William Tyndale: If God Spare My Life''. Abacus. London. 2003 pp. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary Christian churches and religious groups hold the moral teachings of the [[Ten Commandments]] or of [[Jesus]] as the highest authority in any situation, regardless of the extent to which it involves responsibilities in law.&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gospel of John]] (7:53–8:11) (King James Version) Jesus challenges those accusing a woman of adultery stating: "'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.'

In the [[Gospel of Luke]] (10: 25–37) Jesus tells the story of how a despised and heretical [[Samaritan]] (see [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]]) who (out of compassion and conscience) helps an injured stranger beside a road, qualifies better for eternal life by loving his neighbor, than a priest who passes by on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie D, Motyer JA, Stibbs AM, Wiseman DLJ (eds).

This dilemma of obedience in conscience to divine or state law, was demonstrated dramatically in [[Antigone]]'s defiance of [[Creon|King Creon]]'s order against burying her brother an alleged traitor, appealing to the "[[natural law|unwritten law]]" and to a "longer allegiance to the dead than to the living".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves.

{{anchor|ConscienceInCatholicTheology}}[[Catholic]] [[theology]] sees conscience as the last practical "judgment of reason which at the appropriate moment enjoins [a person] to do good and to avoid evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|CCC}}''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' – English translation (U.S., 2nd edition) (English translation of the Catechism of the Catholic Church: Modifications from the Editio Typica, copyright 1997, United States Catholic Conference, Inc. – Libreria Editrice Vaticana) (Glossary and Index Analyticus, copyright 2000, U.S. Catholic Conference, Inc.). {{ISBN|1-57455-110-8}} paragraph 1778&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65) describes: "Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil, tells him inwardly at the right movement: do this, shun that. For man has in his heart a law inscribed by God. His dignity lies in observing this law, and by it he will be judged. His conscience is man’s most secret core, and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths."&lt;ref&gt;Vatican Council II: The Conciliar and Post Conciliar Documents. Collegeville: The Liturgical Press 1992. ''Gaudium and Spes'' 16. Cfr. Joseph Ratzinger, ''On Conscience'', San Francisco: Ignatius Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, conscience is not like the will, nor a habit like prudence, but "the interior space in which we can listen to and hear the truth, the good, the voice of God. It is the inner place of our relationship with Him, who speaks to our heart and helps us to discern, to understand the path we ought to take, and once the decision is made, to move forward, to remain faithful"&lt;ref&gt;Pope Francis "Jesus Always Invites Us. He Does Not Impose." Sunday, June 30, 2013 Whispers From The Loggia http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com.au/2013/06/jesus-always-invites-us-he-does-not.html (accessed 11 Dec 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of logic, conscience can be viewed as the practical conclusion of a moral syllogism whose major premise is an objective norm and whose minor premise is a particular case or situation to which the norm is applied. Thus, Catholics are taught to carefully educate themselves as to revealed norms and norms derived therefrom, so as to form a correct conscience.  Catholics are also to examine their conscience daily and with special care before [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. Catholic teaching holds that, "Man has the right to act according to his conscience and in freedom so as personally to make moral decisions. He must not be forced to act contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from acting according to his conscience, especially in religious matters".&lt;ref&gt;''[[#CCC|Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', paragraph 1782&lt;/ref&gt; This right of conscience does not allow one to arbitrarily disagree with Church teaching and claim that one is acting in accordance with conscience.  A sincere conscience presumes one is diligently seeking moral truth from authentic sources, that is, seeking to conform oneself to that moral truth by listening to the authority established by Christ to teach it. Nevertheless, despite one's best effort, "[i]t can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already committed&amp;nbsp;... This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility&amp;nbsp;... In such cases, the person is culpable for the [[evil|wrong]] he commits."&lt;ref&gt;''[[#CCC|Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', paragraph 1790–91&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if one realizes one may have made a mistaken judgment, one's conscience is said to be vincibly erroneous and it is not a valid norm for action.  One must first remove the source of error and do one's best to achieve a correct judgment.  If, however, one is not aware of one's error or if, despite an honest and diligent effort one cannot remove the error by study or seeking advice, then one's conscience may be said to be invincibly erroneous.  It binds since one has subjective certainty that one is correct.  The act resulting from acting on the invincibly erroneous conscience is not good in itself, yet this deformed act or material sin against God's right order and the objective norm is not imputed to the person. The formal obedience given to such a judgment of conscience is good. Some Catholics appeal to conscience in order to justify dissent, not on the level of conscience properly understood, but on the level of the principles and norms which are supposed to inform conscience.  For example, some [[priests]] make on the use of the so-called [[internal forum]] solution (which is not sanctioned by the Magisterium) to justify actions or lifestyles incompatible with Church teaching, such as Christ's prohibition of remarriage after divorce or sexual activity outside marriage. The [[Catholic Church]] has warned that "rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching&amp;nbsp;... can be at the source of errors in judgment in [[moral]] conduct".&lt;ref&gt;''[[#CCC|Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', paragraph 1792&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of someone following his conscience to the point of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir [[Thomas More]] (1478-1535).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Willard Crompton, "Thomas More: And His Struggles of Conscience" (Chelsea House Publications, 2006); Marc D. Guerra, 'Thomas More's Correspondence on Conscience', in: ''Religion &amp; Liberty'' 10(2010)6 (https://acton.org/thomas-mores-correspondence-conscience); Prof. Gerald Wegemer, "Integrity and Conscience in the Life and Thought of Thomas More" [21 aug. 2006](http://thomasmoreinstitute.org.uk/papers/integrity-and-conscience-in-the-life-and-thought-of-thomas-more/); http://sacredheartmercy.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/A-Reflection-on-Conscience.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was [[John Henry Cardinal Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. his ''Essay in Aid of a Grammar of Assent'' [1870], p. 105-106; 109vv. (https://archive.org/details/a599830700newmuoft)&lt;/ref&gt; A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. his ''Letter to the Duke of Norfolk'' (1874), part 5: "Conscience" (http://www.newmanreader.org/works/anglicans/volume2/gladstone/section5.html)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] arguably does not require uncompromising obedience to religious authority; the case has been made that throughout [[Jewish history]] [[rabbis]] have circumvented laws they found unconscionable, such as capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Harold H Schulweis. ''Conscience: The Duty to Obey and the Duty to Disobey''. Jewish Lights Publishing. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, although an occupation with national destiny has been central to the Jewish faith (see [[Zionism]]) many scholars (including [[Moses Mendelssohn]]) stated that conscience as a personal revelation of scriptural truth was an important adjunct to the [[Talmudic]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart.

"Conscience as principled responsibility: on the philosophy of stage six" in Zecha G and Weingartner P (Eds). ''Conscience: An Interdisciplinary View''. D. Reidel, Dordrecht. 1987 {{ISBN|90-277-2452-0}} pp. 3–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Erikson]] placed the development of ''conscience'' in the 'pre-schooler' phase of his eight stages of normal human personality development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wurgaft | first1 = LD. |  year = 1976 | title = Erik Erikson: from Luther to Gandhi | url = | journal = Psychoanalytic review | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 209–33 | pmid = 788015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[Martha Stout]] terms ''conscience'' "an intervening sense of obligation based in our emotional attachments."&lt;ref&gt;Martha Stout.

Broadway Books. {{ISBN|0-7679-1581-X}}. {{ISBN|978-0-7679-1581-6}}. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a good conscience is associated with feelings of integrity, psychological wholeness and peacefulness and is often described using adjectives such as "quiet", "clear" and "easy".&lt;ref&gt;Childress JF. ''Appeals to Conscience''. Ethics 1979; 89: 315–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] regarded ''conscience'' as originating psychologically from the growth of [[civilisation]], which periodically frustrated the external expression of [[aggression]]: this destructive impulse being forced to seek an alternative, healthy outlet, directed its energy as a [[superego]] against the person's own "ego" or selfishness (often taking its cue in this regard from parents during childhood).&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm. ''Greatness and Limitations of Freud's Thought''. Jonathan Cape, London. 1980. pp. 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Freud, the consequence of not obeying our conscience is [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], which can be a factor in the development of [[neurosis]]; Freud claimed that both the cultural and individual super-ego set up strict ideal demands with regard to the moral aspects of certain decisions, disobedience to which provokes a 'fear of conscience'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud. "The Cultural Super-Ego" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Damasio]] considers conscience an aspect of [[extended consciousness]] beyond survival-related dispositions and incorporating the search for truth and desire to build norms and ideals for behavior.

[[Michel Glautier]] argues that conscience is one of the [[instincts]] and drives which enable people to form societies: groups of humans without these drives or in whom they are insufficient cannot form societies and do not reproduce their kind as successfully as those that do.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Glautier.

[[Charles Darwin]] considered that ''conscience'' evolved in humans to resolve conflicts between competing natural impulses-some about self-preservation but others about safety of a family or community; the claim of conscience to [[moral authority]] emerged from the "greater duration of impression of social instincts" in the struggle for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Compare

&lt;/ref&gt; In such a view, behavior destructive to a person's [[society]] (either to its structures or to the persons it comprises) is bad or "evil".&lt;ref&gt;Milton Wessel. ''Science and Conscience''. Columbia University Press, New York 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, conscience can be viewed as an outcome of those biological drives that prompt humans to avoid provoking [[fear]] or [[contempt]] in others; being experienced as [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[shame]] in differing ways from society to society and person to person.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy, Eric. ''Conscience and Its Right to Freedom''. Sheed and Ward, New York 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement of conscience in this view is the capacity to see ourselves from the point of view of another person.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Fogelman. ''Conscience &amp; courage: rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust''. New York: Anchor Books, c1994&lt;/ref&gt; Persons unable to do this ([[psychopathy|psychopaths]], [[Psychopathy#Psychopathy vs. sociopathy|sociopaths]], [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissists]]) therefore often act in ways which are "evil".&lt;ref&gt;George Kateb. ''Hannah Arendt: politics, conscience, evil''. Martin Robertson, Oxford. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamental in this view of conscience is that humans consider some "other" as being ''in a social relationship''. Thus, [[nationalism]] is invoked in conscience to quell [[tribal]] conflict and the notion of a Brotherhood of Man is invoked to quell [[war|national conflicts]]. Yet such crowd drives may not only overwhelm but redefine individual ''conscience''. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] stated: "communal solidarity is annihilated by the highest and strongest drives that, when they break out passionately, whip the individual far past the average low level of the 'herd-conscience.'&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche "The Origins of Herd Morality" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] noted that: "[[fanaticism]] never sleeps&amp;nbsp;... it is never stopped by ''conscience''; for it has pressed ''conscience'' into its service."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bentham. ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation''. (Burns JH and Hart HLA eds), Athlone Press. London. 1970 Ch 12 p. 156n.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hannah Arendt]] in her study of the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Jerusalem, notes that the accused, as with almost all his fellow Germans, had lost track of his ''conscience'' to the point where they hardly remembered it; this wasn't caused by familiarity with atrocities or by psychologically redirecting any resultant natural pity to themselves for having to bear such an unpleasant duty, so much as by the fact that anyone whose ''conscience'' did develop doubts could see no one who shared them: "Eichmann did not need to close his ears to the voice of conscience&amp;nbsp;... not because he had none, but because his conscience spoke with a "respectable voice", with the voice of the respectable society around him".&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt. ''Eichmann in Jerusalem''. Penguin Books, New York. 1994 {{ISBN|0-14-018765-0}}. pp. 95, 103, 106, 116, 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Arthur Keith]] in 1948 developed the [[Amity-enmity complex]]. We evolved as tribal groups surrounded by enemies; thus conscience evolved a dual role; the duty to save and protect members of the [[in-group]], and the duty to show hatred and aggression towards any [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]].

An interesting area of research in this context concerns the similarities between our relationships and those of [[animal]]s, whether animals in human society ([[pets]], [[working animal]]s, even animals grown for food) or in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. {{cite web

He subsequently reinforced this idea through the lense of the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], since the unit of natural selection is neither an individual organism nor a group, but rather [[The Selfish Gene|the "selfish" gene]], and these genes could ensure their own "selfish" survival by, ''inter alia'', pushing individuals to act altruistically towards its kin.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins.

====Neuroscience and artificial conscience====

Numerous case studies of [[brain damage]] have shown that damage to areas of the [[brain]] (such as the anterior [[prefrontal cortex]]) results in the reduction or elimination of [[social inhibition|inhibitions]], with a corresponding radical change in behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Tranel, D. 'Acquired sociopathy': the development of sociopathic behavior following focal brain damage. Prog. Exp. Pers. Psychopathol. Res. 1994; 285–311.&lt;/ref&gt; When the damage occurs to adults, they may still be able to perform moral reasoning; but when it occurs to children, they may never develop that ability.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J.

Attempts have been made by neuroscientists to locate the [[free will]] necessary for what is termed the 'veto' of conscience over unconscious mental processes (see [[Neuroscience of free will]] and [[Benjamin Libet]]) in a scientifically measurable awareness of an intention to carry out an act occurring 350–400 microseconds after the electrical discharge known as the 'readiness potential.'&lt;ref&gt;Libet B, Freeman A and Sutherland K (eds).

The word "conscience" derives etymologically from the Latin ''conscientia'', meaning "privity of knowledge"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', second edition, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
or "with-knowledge". The [[English language|English]] word implies internal awareness of a moral standard in the mind concerning the quality of one's motives, as well as a consciousness of our own actions.&lt;ref&gt;Little, W, Fowler HW, Coulson J, Onions CT. ''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary On Historical Principles''. 3rd ed. Vol 1 Clarendon Pres. Oxford. 1992. pp. 402–03.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''conscience'' considered philosophically may be first, and perhaps most commonly, a largely unexamined "gut feeling" or "vague sense of guilt" about what ought to be or should have been done. Conscience in this sense is not necessarily the product of a process of rational consideration of the moral features of a situation (or the applicable [[normative]] principles, rules or laws) and can arise from parental, peer group, religious, state or corporate [[indoctrination]], which may or may not be presently consciously acceptable to the person ("traditional conscience").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer. ''Practical Ethics''. 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1993 pp. 292–95.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Conscience'' may be defined as the [[practical reason]] employed when applying moral convictions to a situation ("critical conscience").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer. ''Democracy and Disobedience''. Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1973. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In purportedly morally mature mystical people who have developed this capacity through daily [[contemplation]] or [[meditation]] combined with selfless service to others, ''critical conscience'' can be aided by a "spark" of intuitive insight or revelation (called [[marifa]] in [[Islamic]] [[Sufi]] philosophy and [[synderesis]] in medieval Christian [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[moral philosophy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart.

====Medieval====

The medieval [[Islamic]] scholar and mystic [[Al-Ghazali]] divided the concept of ''[[Nafs]]'' ([[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[self (spirituality)]]) into three categories&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"/&gt; based on the [[Qur’an]]:

#Nafs Ammarah (12:53) which "exhorts one to freely indulge in gratifying passions and instigates to do evil"
#Nafs Lawammah (75:2) which is "the conscience that directs man towards right or wrong"
#Nafs Mutmainnah (89:27) which is "a self that reaches the ultimate peace"

The medieval Persian philosopher and physician [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] believed in a close relationship between ''conscience'' or spiritual integrity and physical health; rather than being self-indulgent, man should pursue knowledge, use his intellect and apply justice in his life.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Arberry (transl.). ''The spiritual Physik of Rhazes'' (London, John Murray 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval Islamic philosopher [[Avicenna]], whilst imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near [[Hamadhan]], wrote his famous isolated-but-awake "Floating Man" [[sensory deprivation]] [[thought experiment]] to explore the ideas of human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]; his hypothesis being that it is through [[intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], that God communicates [[truth]] to the human [[mind]] or conscience.&lt;ref name="autogenerated67"/&gt; According to the Islamic [[Sufis]] conscience allows [[Allah]] to guide people to the [[marifa]], the peace or "light upon light" experienced where a Muslim's prayers lead to a melting away of the self in the inner knowledge of God; this foreshadowing the eternal Paradise depicted in the [[Qur’ān]].&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The Religious Experience of Mankind''. Collins. New York. 1969. pp. 511–12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan Van Ruysbroeck.jpg|thumb|upright|The Flemish mystic [[Jan van Ruysbroek (scholar)|Jan van Ruysbroeck]] viewed a pure conscience as facilitating "an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of that eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness"]]

Some medieval Christian [[scholasticism|scholastics]] such as [[Bonaventure]] made a distinction between conscience as a rational faculty of the mind ([[practical reason]]) and inner awareness, an intuitive "spark" to do good, called ''[[synderesis]]'' arising from a remnant appreciation of absolute good and when consciously denied (for example to perform an evil act), becoming a source of inner torment.&lt;ref name="Langston34"/&gt; Early modern theologians such as [[William Perkins (Puritan)|William Perkins]] and [[William Ames]] developed a syllogistic understanding of the conscience, where God's law made the first term, the act to be judged the second and the action of the conscience (as a rational faculty) produced the judgement. By debating test cases applying such understanding conscience was trained and refined (i.e. [[casuistry]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ceri Sullivan. ''The Rhetoric of the Conscience in Donne, Herbert, and Vaughan''.

[[File:Avicenna.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The medieval Persian philosopher [[Ibn Sina]] ([[Avicenna]]) developed a sensory deprivation thought experiment to explore the relationship between conscience and God]]

In the 13th century, [[Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]] regarded ''conscience'' as the application of moral knowledge to a particular case (S.T. I, q. 79, a. 13).  Thus, conscience was considered an act or judgment of practical reason that began with [[synderesis]], the structured development of our innate remnant awareness of absolute good (which he categorised as involving the five primary precepts proposed in his theory of [[Natural Law]]) into an acquired habit of applying moral principles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated145"/&gt; According to Singer, Aquinas held that conscience, or ''conscientia'' was an imperfect process of judgment applied to activity because knowledge of the [[natural law]] (and all acts of natural virtue implicit therein) was obscured in most people by education and custom that promoted selfishness rather than fellow-feeling (''Summa Theologiae'', I–II, I).&lt;ref name="Thomas Aquinas pp. 247-249"&gt;Thomas Aquinas. "Of the Natural Law" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 pp. 247–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also discussed conscience in relation to the virtue of [[prudence]] to explain why some people appear to be less "morally enlightened" than others, their weak will being incapable of adequately balancing their own needs with those of others.&lt;ref&gt;Saarinen, R. ''Weakness of the Will in Medieval Thought From Augustine to Buridan''. Brill, Leiden. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas reasoned that acting contrary to conscience is an [[evil]] action but an errant conscience is only blameworthy if it is the result of culpable or [[vincible ignorance]] of factors that one has a duty to have knowledge of.&lt;ref name="Thomas Aquinas pp. 247-249"/&gt; Aquinas also argued that conscience should be educated to act towards real goods (from [[God]]) which encouraged [[human flourishing]], rather than the apparent goods of sensory pleasures.&lt;ref name="Thomas Aquinas pp. 247-249"/&gt; In his ''Commentary'' on [[Aristotle]]'s [[Nicomachean Ethics]] Aquinas claimed it was weak will that allowed a non-virtuous man to choose a principle allowing pleasure ahead of one requiring moral constraint.&lt;ref&gt;Brain Davies. ''The Thought of Thomas Aquinas''. Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas A Kempis]] in the medieval [[contemplative]] classic ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' (ca 1418) stated that the glory of a good man is the witness of a good conscience. "Preserve a quiet conscience and you will always have joy. A quiet conscience can endure much, and remains joyful in all trouble, but an evil conscience is always fearful and uneasy."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A Kempis. "The Imitation of Christ". Leo Sherley-Price (trans) Penguin Books. London. 1965 Bk II, ch. 6 ''On The Joys of a Good Conscience''. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The anonymous medieval author of the Christian [[mystical]] work [[The Cloud of Unknowing]] similarly expressed the view that in profound and prolonged [[contemplation]] a soul dries up the "root and ground" of the [[sin]] that is always there, even after one's [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and however busy one is in [[holy]] things: "therefore, whoever would work at becoming a [[contemplative]] must first cleanse his [or her] conscience."&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. ''The Cloud of Unknowing''. Clifton Wolters (trans.) Penguin Books. London 1965 ch. 28 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval Flemish mystic [[John of Ruysbroeck]] likewise held that true conscience has four aspects that are necessary to render a man just in the active and contemplative life: "a free spirit, attracting itself through love"; "an intellect enlightened by grace", "a delight yielding propension or inclination" and "an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of&amp;nbsp;... that eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness&amp;nbsp;... those lofty amongst men, are absorbed in it, and immersed in a certain boundless thing."&lt;ref&gt;John of Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. Kegan Paul. London. 1919. ch. III pp. 14–15 and ch XLIII p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] considered that the good conscience we experience after an unselfish act verifies that our true self exists outside our physical person]]

[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Immanuel Kant]]: the moral law within us has true infinity.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

[[Baruch Spinoza|Benedict de Spinoza]] in his [[Ethics (Spinoza)|''Ethics'']], published after his death in 1677, argued that most people, even those that consider themselves to exercise [[free will]], make moral decisions on the basis of imperfect sensory information, inadequate understanding of their mind and will, as well as emotions which are both outcomes of their contingent physical existence and forms of thought defective from being chiefly impelled by self-preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza. ''Ethics''. Everyman's Library JM Dent, London. 1948. Part 2 proposition 35. Part 3 proposition 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The solution, according to Spinoza, was to gradually increase the capacity of our reason to change the forms of thought produced by emotions and to fall in love with viewing problems requiring moral decision from the perspective of eternity.&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza. ''Ethics''. Everyman's Library JM Dent, London. 1948. Part 4 proposition 59, Part 5 proposition 30&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, living a life of peaceful conscience means to Spinoza that reason is used to generate adequate ideas where the mind increasingly sees the world and its conflicts, our desires and passions ''sub specie aeternitatis'', that is without reference to time.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Scruton. "Spinoza" in Raphael F and Monk R (eds). ''The Great Philosophers''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. London. 2000. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hegel]]'s obscure and [[mystical]] [[Philosophy of Mind]] held that the absolute right of ''freedom of conscience'' facilitates human understanding of an all-embracing unity, an absolute which was rational, real and true.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L Gregory. ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind''. Oxford University Press. Oxford. 1987 p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Hegel thought that a functioning State would always be tempted not to recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge, just as similar non-objective opinions are generally rejected in science.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Hegel. ''Philosophy of Right''. Knox TM trans, Clarendon Press, Oxford. 1942. para 137.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings of [[Joseph Butler]] who argued that conscience is [[God]]-given, should always be obeyed, is intuitive, and should be considered the "constitutional monarch" and the "universal moral faculty": "conscience does not only offer itself to show us the way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Butler "Sermons" in ''The Works of Joseph Butler''. (Gladstone WE ed), Clarendon Press, Oxford. 1896, Vol II p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Butler advanced ethical speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human nature: first,"self-love" (seeking individual happiness) and second, "benevolence" (compassion and seeking good for another) in ''conscience'' (also linked to the [[agape]] of [[situational ethics]]).&lt;ref name="autogenerated365"/&gt; Conscience tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment, thought Butler, because it was more likely to be clear and certain (whereas calculations of self-interest tended to probable and changing conclusions).&lt;ref&gt;Henry Sidgwick. ''Outlines of the History of Ethics''. Macmillan, London. 1960 pp. 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Selden]] in his ''Table Talk'' expressed the view that an awake but excessively scrupulous or ill-trained ''conscience'' could hinder resolve and practical action; it being "like a horse that is not well wayed, he starts at every bird that flies out of the hedge".&lt;ref&gt;John Selden. ''Table Talk''. Garnett R, Valee L and Brandl A (eds) The Book of Literature: A Comprehensive Anthology. The Grolier Society. Toronto. 1923. Vol 14. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the sacred texts of ancient [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] philosophy became available in German translations in the 18th and 19th centuries, they influenced philosophers such as [[Schopenhauer]] to hold that in a healthy mind only deeds oppress our ''conscience'', not wishes and thoughts; "for it is only our deeds that hold us up to the mirror of our will"; the ''good conscience'', thought Schopenhauer, we experience after every disinterested deed arises from direct recognition of our own inner being in the phenomenon of another, it affords us the verification "that our true self exists not only in our own person, this particular manifestation, but in everything that lives. By this the heart feels itself enlarged, as by egotism it is contracted."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer. ''The World as Will and Idea''. Vol 1. Routledge and Kegan Paul. London. 1948. pp. 387, 482. "I believe that the influence of the Sanskrit literature will penetrate not less deeply than did the revival of Greek literature in the 15th century." p xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]], a central figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], likewise claimed that two things filled his mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily they were reflected on: "the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me&amp;nbsp;... the latter begins from my invisible self, my personality, and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity but which I recognise myself as existing in a universal and necessary (and not only, as in the first case, contingent) connection."&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. "The Noble Descent of Duty" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'universal connection' referred to here is Kant's [[categorical imperative]]: "act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. "The Categorical Imperative" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant considered ''critical conscience'' to be an internal court in which our thoughts accuse or excuse one another; he acknowledged that morally mature people do often describe contentment or peace in the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] after following conscience to perform a duty, but argued that for such acts to produce virtue their primary motivation should simply be duty, not expectation of any such bliss.&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. "The Doctrine of Virtue" in ''Metaphyics and Morals''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. 1991. pp. 183 and 233–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau expressed a similar view that conscience somehow connected man to a greater [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] unity. [[John Plamenatz]] in his critical examination of [[Rousseau]]'s work considered that ''conscience'' was there defined as the feeling that urges us, in spite of contrary passions, towards two harmonies: the one within our minds and between our passions, and the other within society and between its members; "the weakest can appeal to it in the strongest, and the appeal, though often unsuccessful, is always disturbing. However, corrupted by power or wealth we may be, either as possessors of them or as victims, there is something in us serving to remind us that this corruption is against nature."&lt;ref&gt;John Plamenatz. ''Man and Society''. Vol 1. Longmans. London. 1963 p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other philosophers expressed a more sceptical and pragmatic view of the operation of "conscience" in society.&lt;ref&gt;Hill T Jr "Four Conceptions of Conscience" in Shapiro I and Adams R. ''Integrity and Conscience''. New York University Press, New York 1998 p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Locke]] in his ''Essays on the Law of Nature'' argued that the widespread fact of human conscience allowed a philosopher to infer the necessary existence of objective moral laws that occasionally might contradict those of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Woolhouse]]. ''Locke: A Biography''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 2007. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke highlighted the [[metaethics]] problem of whether accepting a statement like "follow your ''conscience''" supports [[subject (philosophy)|subjectivist]] or [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivist]] conceptions of conscience as a guide in concrete morality, or as a spontaneous revelation of eternal and immutable principles to the individual: "if conscience be a proof of innate principles, contraries may be innate principles; since some men with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid."&lt;ref&gt;John Locke. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Dover Publications. New York. 1959. {{ISBN|0-486-20530-4}}. Vol 1. ch II. pp. 71-72fn1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes]] likewise pragmatically noted that opinions formed on the basis of ''conscience'' with full and honest conviction, nevertheless should always be accepted with humility as potentially erroneous and not necessarily indicating absolute knowledge or truth.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes. ''Leviathan'' (Molesworth W ed) J Bohn. London, 1837 Pt 2. Ch 29 p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Godwin]] expressed the view that ''conscience'' was a memorable consequence of the "perception by men of every creed when the descend into the scene of busy life" that they possess [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;William Godwin. ''Enquiry Concerning Political Justice''. Codell Carter K (ed), Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1971 Appendix III 'Thoughts on Man' Essay XI 'Of Self Love and Benevolence' p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Smith]] considered that it was only by developing a ''critical conscience'' that we can ever see what relates to ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions; or that we can ever make any proper comparison between our own interests and those of other people.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith. ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''. Part III, section ii, Ch III in Rogers K (ed) Self Interest: An Anthology of Philosophical Perspectives. Routledge. London. 1997 p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stuart Mill]] believed that idealism about the role of ''conscience'' in government should be tempered with a practical realisation that few men in society are capable of directing their minds or purposes towards distant or unobvious interests, of disinterested regard for others, and especially for what comes after them, for the idea of posterity, of their country, or of humanity, whether grounded on sympathy or on a conscientious feeling.&lt;ref name="Mill193-194"&gt;John Stuart Mill. "Considerations on Representative Government". Ch VI. In Rogers K (ed) ''Self Interest: An Anthology of Philosophical Perspectives''. Routledge. London. 1997 pp. 193–94&lt;/ref&gt; Mill held that certain amount of ''conscience'', and of disinterested public spirit, may fairly be calculated on in the citizens of any community ripe for [[representative government]], but that "it would be ridiculous to expect such a degree of it, combined with such intellectual discernment, as would be proof against any plausible fallacy tending to make that which was for their class interest appear the dictate of justice and of the general good."&lt;ref name="Mill193-194"/&gt;

[[Josiah Royce]] (1855–1916) built on the [[transcendental idealism]] view of conscience, viewing it as the ideal of life which constitutes our moral personality, our plan of being ourself, of making common sense ethical decisions. But, he thought, this was only true insofar as our ''conscience'' also required loyalty to "a mysterious higher or deeper self."&lt;ref&gt;John K Roth (ed). ''The Philosophy of Josiah Royce''. Thomas Y Crowell Co. New York. 1971 pp. 302–15.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the modern Christian tradition this approach achieved expression with [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] who stated during his imprisonment by the [[Nazis]] in [[World War II]] that ''conscience'' for him was more than practical reason, indeed it came from a "depth which lies beyond a man's own will and his own reason and it makes itself heard as the call of human existence to unity with itself."&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer. ''Ethics''. (Eberhard Bethge (ed) Neville Horton Smith (trans) Collins. London 1963 p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; For Bonhoeffer a ''guilty conscience'' arose as an indictment of the loss of this unity and as a warning against the loss of one's self; primarily, he thought, it is directed not towards a particular kind of doing but towards a particular mode of being. It protests against a doing which imperils the unity of this being with itself.&lt;ref name="autogenerated24"/&gt; ''Conscience'' for Bonhoeffer did not, like shame, embrace or pass judgment on the morality of the whole of its owner's life; it reacted only to certain definite actions: "it recalls what is long past and represents this disunion as something which is already accomplished and irreparable".&lt;ref name="Bonhoffer66"&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer. ''Ethics''. (Eberhard Bethge (ed) Neville Horton Smith (trans) Collins. London 1963 p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The man with a ''conscience'', he believed, fights a lonely battle against the "overwhelming forces of inescapable situations" which demand moral decisions despite the likelihood of adverse consequences.&lt;ref name="Bonhoffer66"/&gt;[[Simon Soloveychik]] has similarly claimed that the ''truth'' distributed in the world, as the statement about human [[dignity]], as the affirmation of the line between [[good and evil|good]] and [[evil]], lives in people as conscience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Soloveychik]].

As [[Hannah Arendt]] pointed out, however, (following the utilitarian [[John Stuart Mill]] on this point): a bad conscience does not necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad ''conscience'' and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt.

University of Toronto Press. Toronto. 1969 Vols 10 and 18. Ch 3. pp. 228–29 and 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that "conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home."&lt;ref name="autogenerated191"&gt;Hannah Arendt. ''The Life of the Mind''. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, New York. 1978. p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt believed that people who are unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can "count on its being forgotten the next moment;" bad people are not full of regrets.&lt;ref name="autogenerated191"/&gt; Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word [[consciousness]] from ''conscience''. One reason, she held, was that ''conscience'', as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like ''consciousness'': "and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to do and what to repent; before it became the ''lumen naturale'' or [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s practical reason, it was the voice of God."&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt.

[[Albert Einstein]], as a self-professed adherent of [[humanism]] and [[rationalism]], likewise viewed an enlightened religious person as one whose ''conscience'' reflects that he "has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings and aspirations to which he clings because of their super-personal value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=A.|year=1940|title=Science and religion |journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=146 |pages=605–07|doi=10.1038/146605a0 |issue=3706 |bibcode=1940Natur.146..605E}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Einstein often referred to the "inner voice" as a source of both moral and physical knowledge: "[[Quantum mechanics]] is very impressive. But an inner voice tells me that it is not the real thing. The theory produces a good deal but hardly brings one closer to the secrets of the Old One. I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gino Segre. ''Faust in Copenhagen: A Struggle for the Soul of Physics and the Birth of the Nuclear Age''. Pimlico. London 2007. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simone Weil]] who fought for the French resistance (the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]) argued in her final book ''[[The Need for Roots]]: Prelude to a Declaration of Duties Towards Mankind'' that for society to become more just and protective of liberty, obligations should take precedence over rights in moral and political philosophy and a spiritual awakening should occur in the ''conscience'' of most citizens, so that social obligations are viewed as fundamentally having a transcendent origin and a beneficent impact on human character when fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Weil. ''The Need For Roots: Prelude to a Declaration of Duties Towards Mankind''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul. London. 1952 (repr 2003). {{ISBN|0-415-27101-0}} pp. 13 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hellman, John. ''Simone Weil: An Introduction to Her Thought''. Wilfrid Laurier, University Press, Waterloo, Ontario. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simone Weil]] also in that work provided a psychological explanation for the mental peace associated with a ''good conscience'': "the liberty of men of goodwill, though limited in the sphere of action, is complete in that of conscience. For, having incorporated the rules into their own being, the prohibited possibilities no longer present themselves to the mind, and have not to be rejected."&lt;ref&gt;Simone Weil. ''The Need For Roots: Prelude to a Declaration of Duties Towards Mankind''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul. London. 1952 (repr 2003). {{ISBN|0-415-27101-0}} p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives to such [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[idealism|idealist]] opinions about conscience arose from [[philosophical realism|realist]] and [[materialism|materialist]] perspectives such as those of [[Charles Darwin]]. Darwin suggested that "any [[animal]] whatever, endowed with well-marked social instincts, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become as well, or as nearly as well developed, as in man."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin. "The Origin of the Moral Sense" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]] held that the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and conscience were particular forms of an impersonal principle diffused in the relevant group and communicated by [[totemic]] ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Durkheim. ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life''. The Free Press. New York. 1965 p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; [[AJ Ayer]] was a more recent realist who held that the existence of ''conscience'' was an empirical question to be answered by sociological research into the moral habits of a given person or group of people, and what causes them to have precisely those habits and feelings. Such an inquiry, he believed, fell wholly within the scope of the existing [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;AJ Ayer. "Ethics for Logical Positivists" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Edward Moore]] bridged the idealistic and sociological views of 'critical' and 'traditional' conscience in stating that the idea of abstract 'rightness' and the various degrees of the specific emotion excited by it are what constitute, for many persons, the specifically 'moral sentiment' or ''conscience''. For others, however, an action seems to be properly termed 'internally right', merely because they have previously regarded it as right, the idea of 'rightness' being present in some way to his or her mind, but not necessarily among his or her deliberately constructed motives.&lt;ref&gt;GE Moore. ''Principia Ethica''. Cambridge University Press. London. 1968 pp. 178–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] in ''A Very Easy Death'' (''Une mort très douce'', 1964) reflects within her own ''conscience'' about her mother's attempts to develop such a moral sympathy and understanding of others.&lt;ref&gt;Simone de Beauvoir.

[[Michael Walzer]] claimed that the growth of religious toleration in Western nations arose amongst other things, from the general recognition that private conscience signified some inner divine presence regardless of the religious faith professed and from the general respectability, piety, self-limitation, and sectarian discipline which marked most of the men who claimed the rights of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walzer. ''Obligations: Essays on Disobedience, War and Citizenship''. Clarion-Simon and Schuster. New York. 1970. p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Walzer also argued that attempts by courts to define conscience as a merely personal moral code or as sincere belief, risked encouraging an anarchy of moral egotisms, unless such a code and motive was necessarily tempered with shared moral knowledge: derived either from the connection of the individual to a universal spiritual order, or from the common principles and mutual engagements of unselfish people.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walzer. ''Obligations: Essays on Disobedience, War and Citizenship''. Clarion-Simon and Schuster. New York. 1970. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Dworkin]] maintains that constitutional protection of [[freedom of conscience]] is central to democracy but creates personal duties to live up to it: "Freedom of conscience presupposes a personal responsibility of reflection, and it loses much of its meaning when that responsibility is ignored. A good life need not be an especially reflective one; most of the best lives are just lived rather than studied. But there are moments that cry out for self-assertion, when a passive bowing to fate or a mechanical decision out of deference or convenience is treachery, because it forfeits dignity for ease."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin. ''Life's Dominion''. Harper Collins, London 1995. pp. 239–40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Conze]] stated it is important for individual and collective moral growth that we recognise the illusion of our conscience being wholly located in our body; indeed both our conscience and wisdom expand when we act in an unselfish way and conversely "repressed compassion results in an unconscious sense of guilt."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Conze.

[[File:John Ralston Saul.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[John Ralston Saul]]: consumers risk turning over their conscience to technical experts and to the ideology of free markets]]

[[John Ralston Saul]] expressed the view in ''The Unconscious Civilization'' that in contemporary developed nations many people have acquiesced in turning over their sense of right and wrong, their ''critical conscience'', to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;John Ralston Saul. ''The Unconscious Civilisation''. Massey Lectures Series. Anansi Pres, Toronto. 1995. {{ISBN|0-88784-586-X}} pp. 17, 81 and 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue on religious or philosophical grounds that it is blameworthy to act against ''conscience'', even if the judgement of ''conscience'' is likely to be erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed about the facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms).&lt;ref&gt;Alan Donagan. ''The Theory of Morality''. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. 1977. pp. 131–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, '''conscience''' may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp TL and Childress JF. ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics''. 4th ed. Oxford University Press, New York. 1994 pp. 478–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Langston argues that philosophers of [[virtue ethics]] have unnecessarily neglected ''conscience'' for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act.&lt;ref name="autogenerated176"/&gt;[[Emmanuel Levinas]] viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of [[freedom of will]] to use such powers arbitrarily, or with [[violence]], this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.&lt;ref name="Levinas"&gt;Emmanuel Levinas. ''Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority''. Lingis A (trans) Duquesne University Press, Pittsburgh, PA 1998. pp. 84, 100–01&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, the welcoming of the ''Other'', to Levinas, was the very essence of ''conscience'' properly conceived; it encouraged our ego to accept the fallibility of assuming things about other people, that selfish [[freedom of will]] "does not have the last word" and that realising this has a transcendent purpose: "I am not alone&amp;nbsp;... in conscience I have an experience that is not commensurate with any a priori [see [[a priori and a posteriori]]] framework-a conceptless experience."&lt;ref name="Levinas"/&gt;

English humanist lawyers in the 16th and 17th centuries interpreted conscience as a collection of universal principles given to man by god at creation to be applied by reason; this gradually reforming the medieval [[Roman law]]-based system with forms of action, written pleadings, use of juries and patterns of litigation such as [[Demurrer]] and [[Assumpsit]] that displayed an increased concern for elements of right and wrong on the actual facts.&lt;ref&gt;Knafla LA.

[[John Rawls]] in his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' defines a [[conscientious objector]] as an individual prepared to undertake, in public (and often despite widespread condemnation), an action of [[civil disobedience]] to a legal rule justifying it (also in public) by reference to contrary foundational social virtues (such as justice as liberty or fairness) and the principles of morality and law derived from them.&lt;ref name="John Rawls 1971. pp. 368–70"&gt;John Rawls. A Theory of Justice. Oxford University Press. London 1971. pp. 368–70&lt;/ref&gt; Rawls considered civil disobedience should be viewed as an appeal, warning or admonishment (showing general respect and fidelity to the [[rule of law]] by the non-violence and transparency of methods adopted) that a law breaches a community's fundamental virtue of justice.&lt;ref name="John Rawls 1971. pp. 368–70"/&gt; Objections to Rawls' theory include first, its inability to accommodate conscientious objections to the society's basic appreciation of [[justice]] or to emerging moral or ethical principles (such as respect for the rights of the [[natural environment]]) which are not yet part of it and second, the difficulty of predictably and consistently determining that a majority decision is just or unjust.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer. ''Democracy and Disobedience''. Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1973. pp. 86–91&lt;/ref&gt; ''Conscientious objection'' (also called conscientious refusal or evasion) to obeying a law, should not arise from unreasoning, naive "traditional conscience", for to do so merely encourages infantile abdication of responsibility to calibrate the law against moral or human rights norms and disrespect for democratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer.

In the [[Second World War]], [[Great Britain]] granted conscientious-objection status not just to complete [[pacifist]]s, but to those who objected to fighting in that particular war; this was done partly out of genuine respect, but also to avoid the disgraceful and futile persecutions of [[conscientious objectors]] that occurred during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayes D. ''Challenge of Conscience: The Story of the Conscientious Objectors''. Allen &amp; Unwin. London 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] organises campaigns to protect those arrested and or incarcerated as a [[prisoner of conscience]] because of their conscientious beliefs, particularly concerning intellectual, political and artistic freedom of expression and association.&lt;ref&gt;For example see Jan Brabec, Václav Havel, Ivan Lamper, David Nemec, Petr Placak, Joska Skalnik ''et al.''

Expressed justifications for refusing to obey laws because of conscience vary. Many conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons—notably, members of the [[peace churches|historic peace churches]] are pacifist by doctrine. Other objections can stem from a deep sense of responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from the conviction that even acceptance of work under military orders acknowledges the principle of [[conscription]] that should be everywhere condemned before the world can ever become safe for real [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard Moore.

[[Samuel Johnson]] pointed out that an appeal to conscience should not allow the law to bring unjust suffering upon another. ''Conscience'', according to Johnson, was nothing more than a conviction felt by ourselves of something to be done or something to be avoided; in questions of simple unperplexed morality, ''conscience'' is very often a guide that may be trusted.&lt;ref name="Life of Johnson 505"&gt;[[James Boswell]].

[[Civil disobedience]] as [[non-violent protest]] or [[civil resistance]] are also acts of conscience, but are designed by those who undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity).&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls.

==World conscience==
{{Further|Comparative religion|Universalism|World government|Cosmopolitanism|Common heritage of humanity}}

World conscience is the [[universalism|universalist]] idea that with ready global communication, all people on [[earth]] will no longer be morally estranged from one another, whether it be culturally, ethnically, or geographically; instead they will conceive ethics from the [[utopian]] point of view of the [[universe]], [[eternity]] or [[infinity]], rather than have their duties and obligations defined by forces arising solely within the restrictive boundaries of 'blood and territory.'&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt;

Often this derives from a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[natural law]] perspective, that for [[world peace]] to be achieved, ''conscience'', properly understood, should be generally considered as not necessarily linked (often destructively) to [[fundamentalist]] religious ideologies, but as an aspect of [[universal consciousness]], access to which is the [[common heritage of humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;Bede Griffiths. ''A New Vision of Reality: Western Science, Eastern Mysticism and Christian Faith''. Fount. London. 1992. p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking predicated on the development of ''world conscience'' is common to members of the [[Global Ecovillage Network]] such as the [[Findhorn Foundation]], international conservation organisations like [[Fauna and Flora International]], as well as performers of [[world music]] such as [[Alan Stivell]].&lt;ref&gt;William Thompson. ''Passages About the Earth: An Exploration of the New Planetary Culture''. Rider and Co. London. 1974. Ch 7. 'To Findhorn and Lindisfarne' pp. 150–83.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Non-government organizations]], particularly through their work in agenda-setting, policy-making and implementation of human rights-related policy, have been referred to as the conscience of the world&lt;ref&gt;P willets 'Introduction' in  P.

[[Edward O Wilson]] has developed the idea of [[consilience]] to encourage coherence of global moral and scientific knowledge supporting the premise that "only unified learning, universally shared, makes accurate foresight and wise choice possible".&lt;ref&gt;Edward O Wilson. ''Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge''. Abacus. London. 2003 {{ISBN|0-349-11112-X}} p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''world conscience'' is a concept that overlaps with the [[Gaia hypothesis]] in advocating a balance of moral, legal, scientific and economic solutions to modern transnational problems such as [[global poverty]] and [[climate change]], through strategies such as [[environmental ethics]], [[climate ethics]], [[conservation (ethic)|natural conservation]], [[ecology]], [[cosmopolitanism]], [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]], [[biosequestration]] and legal protection of the [[biosphere]] and [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[EF Schumacher]].

The [[Green party]] politician [[Bob Brown]] (who was arrested by the [[Tasmanian]] state police for a conscientious act of [[civil disobedience]] during the [[Franklin Dam]] protest) expresses ''world conscience'' in these terms: "the universe, through us, is evolving towards experiencing, understanding and making choices about its future'; one example of policy outcomes from such thinking being a global tax (see [[Tobin tax]]) to alleviate global poverty and protect the biosphere, amounting to 1/10 of 1% placed on the worldwide speculative currency market.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Brown. ''Memo For a Saner World''. Penguin Books. Melbourne. 2004. pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach sees ''world conscience'' best expressing itself through political reforms promoting democratically based [[globalisation]] or ''planetary democracy'' (for example [[internet]] voting for global governance organisations (see [[world government]]) based on the model of "one person, one vote, one value") which gradually will replace contemporary market-based globalisation.&lt;ref&gt;James Norman.

A challenge to ''world conscience'' was provided by an influential 1968 article by [[Garrett Hardin]] that critically analyzed the dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest (and, he claimed, the apparently low 'survival-of-the-fittest' value of ''conscience''-led actions) ultimately destroy a shared limited resource, even though each acknowledges such an outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest.&lt;ref name=hardin68/&gt; Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density (and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed), created controversy additionally through his direct deprecation of the role of ''conscience'' in achieving individual decisions, policies and laws that facilitate global justice and peace, as well as [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]] of world commons areas, for example including those officially designated such under [[United Nations]] treaties (see [[common heritage of humanity]]).&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Robert.

The ancient epic of the Indian subcontinent, the [[Mahabharata]] of [[Vyasa]], contains two pivotal moments of ''conscience''. The first occurs when the warrior [[Arjuna]] being overcome with compassion against killing his opposing relatives in war, receives counsel (see [[Bhagavad-Gita]]) from [[Krishna]] about his spiritual duty ("work as though you are performing a sacrifice for the general good").&lt;ref&gt;Vyasa (Kamala Subramaniam abr.). ''Mahabharata''. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay. 1989. pp. 430–32&lt;/ref&gt; The second, at the end of the saga, is when king [[Yudhishthira]] having alone survived the moral tests of life, is offered eternal bliss, only to refuse it because a faithful dog is prevented from coming with him by purported divine rules and laws.&lt;ref&gt;Vyasa (Kamala Subramaniam abr.). ''Mahabharata''. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay. 1989. p. 742.&lt;/ref&gt; The French author [[Montaigne]] (1533–1592) in one of the most celebrated of [[Essays (Montaigne)|his essays]] ("On experience") expressed the benefits of living with a clear conscience: "Our duty is to compose our character, not to compose books, to win not battles and provinces, but order and tranquillity in our conduct. Our great and glorious masterpiece is to live properly".&lt;ref&gt;Michel de Montaigne. ''Essays''. Cohen JM (trans.) Penguin Books. Ringwood. 1984. p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; In his famous Japanese travel journal ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'' (''Narrow Road to the Deep North'') composed of mixed [[haiku]] poetry and prose, [[Matsuo Bashō]] (1644–94) in attempting to describe the eternal in this perishable world is often moved in ''conscience''; for example by a thicket of summer grass being all that remains of the dreams and ambitions of ancient warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuo Bashō.

Penguin Books, Harmondsworth. 1966. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaucer]]'s "[[Franklin's Tale]]" in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' recounts how a young suitor releases a wife from a rash promise because of the respect in his ''conscience'' for the freedom to be truthful, gentle and generous.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chaucer.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Hamlet and Horatio in the Graveyard - WGA6199.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Eugène Delacroix]], ''[[Hamlet]] and Horatio in the Graveyard'' (1839, oil on canvas)]] The critic [[A. C. Bradley]] discusses the central problem of [[Shakespeare]]'s tragic character [[Hamlet]] as one where conscience in the form of moral scruples deters the young Prince with his "great anxiety to do right" from obeying his father's hell-bound ghost and murdering the usurping King ("is't not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm?" (v.ii.67)).&lt;ref&gt;AC Bradley. ''Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures on Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''. Macmillan and Co. London. 1937. pp. 97–101&lt;/ref&gt;
Bradley develops a theory about Hamlet's moral agony relating to a conflict between "traditional" and "critical" conscience: "The conventional moral ideas of his time, which he shared with the Ghost, told him plainly that he ought to avenge his father; but a deeper conscience in him, which was in advance of his time, contended with these explicit conventional ideas. It is because this deeper conscience remains below the surface that he fails to recognise it, and fancies he is hindered by [[cowardice]] or [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]] or [[passion (emotion)|passion]] or what not; but it emerges into light in that speech to Horatio. And it is just because he has this nobler moral nature in him that we admire and love him".&lt;ref&gt;AC Bradley. ''Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures on Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''. Macmillan and Co. London. 1937 p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening words of Shakespeare's [[Sonnet 94]] ("They that have pow'r to hurt, and will do none") have been admired as a description of ''conscience''.&lt;ref&gt;Manning Clark. ''A Discovery of Australia: 1976 Boyer Lectures''. Australian Broadcasting Commission, Sydney. 1976. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; So has [[John Donne]]'s commencement of his poem ''[[:s:Goodfriday, 1613.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1971. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anton Chekhov]] in his plays ''[[The Seagull]]'', ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' describes the tortured emotional states of doctors who at some point in their careers have turned their back on conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Grecco. "A physician healing himself: Chekhov's treatment of doctors in the major plays" in ER Peschel (ed). ''Medicine and Literature'' (1980) pp. 3–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In his short stories, [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] also explored how people misunderstood the voice of a tortured conscience. A promiscuous student, for example, in ''The Fit'' describes it as a "dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was like anguish and the most acute fear and despair&amp;nbsp;... in his breast, under the heart" and the young doctor examining the misunderstood agony of compassion experienced by the factory owner's daughter in ''From a Case Book'' calls it an "unknown, mysterious power&amp;nbsp;... in fact close at hand and watching him."&lt;ref&gt;Anton Chekhov. ''Selected Stories'' (J Coulson, trans.) Oxford University Press. London. 1963 p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, Chekhov's own conscience drove him on the long journey to [[Sakhalin]] to record and alleviate the harsh conditions of the prisoners at that remote outpost. As Irina Ratushinskaya writes in the introduction to that work: "Abandoning everything, he travelled to the distant island of [[Sakhalin]], the most feared place of exile and forced labour in Russia at that time. One cannot help but wonder why? Simply, because the lot of the people there was a bitter one, because nobody really knew about the lives and deaths of the exiles, because he felt that they stood in greater need of help that anyone else. A strange reason, maybe, but not for a writer who was the epitome of all the best traditions of a Russian man of letters. Russian literature has always focused on questions of '''conscience''' and was, therefore, a powerful force in the moulding of public opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Anton Chekhov.

[[E. H. Carr]] writes of [[Dostoevsky]]'s character the young student Raskolnikov in the novel ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' who decides to murder a 'vile and loathsome' old woman money lender on the principle of transcending conventional morals: "the sequel reveals to us not the pangs of a stricken ''conscience'' (which a less subtle writer would have given us) but the tragic and fruitless struggle of a powerful intellect to maintain a conviction which is incompatible with the essential nature of man."&lt;ref&gt;EH Carr.

The [[impressionist]] painter [[Vincent van Gogh]] wrote in a letter to his brother Theo in 1878 that "one must never let the fire in one's soul die, for the time will inevitably come when it will be needed. And he who chooses poverty for himself and loves it possesses a great treasure and will hear the voice of his '''conscience''' address him every more clearly. He who hears that voice, which is God's greatest gift, in his innermost being and follows it, finds in it a friend at last, and he is never alone!&amp;nbsp;...

[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] wrote his last great choral composition the [[Mass in B minor]] (BWV 232) to express the alternating emotions of loneliness, despair, joy and rapture that arise as ''conscience'' reflects on a departed human life.&lt;ref&gt;J.S. Bach. Messe H-Moll/Mass in B minor BWV 232. Balthasar-Neumann-Choir. Freiburger Barockorchester. Thomas Hengelbrock. BMG Music. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Here JS Bach's use of [[counterpoint]] and [[contrapuntal]] settings, his dynamic discourse of melodically and rhythmically distinct voices seeking forgiveness of sins ("''Qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis''") evokes a spiraling moral conversation of all humanity expressing his belief that "with devotional music, God is always present in his grace".&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Wolff. ''Johann Sebastian Bach: The Learned Musician''. Oxford University Press. Oxford. 2000. pp. 8, 339, 438–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s meditations on illness, conscience and mortality in the [[Late String Quartets (Beethoven)|Late String Quartets]] led to his dedicating the third movement of String Quartet in A Minor (1825) Op. 132 (see [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|String Quartet No. 15]]) as a "Hymn of Thanksgiving to God of a convalescent".&lt;ref&gt;JWN Sullivan.

Quartetto Italiano. Phillips Classics Productions 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lennon]]'s work "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" owes much of its popular appeal to its evocation of conscience against the atrocities created by [[war]], [[religious fundamentalism]] and [[politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Urish and Kenneth G. Bielen. ''The Words and Music of John Lennon''. Greenwood Publishing Group. 2007 pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Beatles]] [[George Harrison]]-written track "[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]" sets to Indian [[raga]] music a verse from the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' that "without going out of your door you can know the ways of heaven'.&lt;ref&gt;George Harrison. ''I, Me, Mine''. Chronicle Books. 2007. {{ISBN|0-8118-3793-9}} p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1986 movie ''[[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]'' the guilty conscience and penance of the slave trader Mendoza is made more poignant by the haunting oboe music of [[Ennio Morricone]] ("On Earth as it is in Heaven")&lt;ref&gt;James Schofield Saeger. ''The Mission and Historical Missions: Film and the Writing of History''. The Americas. 1995; 51(3):393–415.&lt;/ref&gt; The song [[Sweet Lullaby]] by [[Deep Forest]] is based on a traditional [[Baeggu language|Baegu]] [[lullaby]] from the [[Solomon Islands]] called "Rorogwela" in which a young orphan is comforted as an act of conscience by his older brother.&lt;ref&gt;Al Weisel, "Deep Forest's Lush Lullaby," Rolling Stone, 21 April 1994, 26&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dream Academy]] song 'Forest Fire' provided an early warning of the moral dangers of our 'black cloud' 'bringing down a different kind of weather&amp;nbsp;... letting the sunshine in, that's how the end begins."&lt;ref&gt;Dream Academy.

The change would be regarded as objectionable if it took place in a single step or short period. 

The phrase was coined by American scientist, [[Jared Diamond]], in his 2005 book, [[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]].  He had previously alluded to this theory while attempting to explain why in the course of long-term [[environmental degradation]], [[Easter Island]] natives would, seemingly irrationally, chop down the last tree:&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;{{cite web |last1=Diamond |first1=Jared |authorlink1=Jared Diamond |title=Easter's End |url= http://discovermagazine.com/1995/aug/eastersend543|publisher=Discover magazine |access-date=2014-08-03 |date=1995-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|"I suspect, though, that the disaster happened not with a bang but with a whimper. After all, there are those hundreds of abandoned statues to consider. The forest the islanders depended on for rollers and rope didn't simply disappear one day--it vanished slowly, over decades."|sign=|source=}}

In his book, Diamond also refers to creeping normality as landscape amnesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fogg|first=Graham E.|last2=LaBolle|first2=Eric M. | name-list-format = vanc |date=14 March 2006|title=Motivation of synthesis, with an example on groundwater quality sustainability |journal=Water Resources Research|volume=42|pages=W03S05|via=Google Scholar | doi = 10.1029/2005WR004372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Other uses==
Creeping normality has been used to explain a number of different phenomenon, including the ones listed below: 

=== Obese and overweight maternity patients ===
The term has also been used several times in conjunction with the increase of maternity patients who present as [[Obesity|obese]] and [[overweight]]. In their research article, authors Wilkinson, Poad, and Stapleton suggest that as the number of clinically obese or overweight pregnant women increase, the negative stigmatization with being so decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkinson SA, Poad D, Stapleton H | title = Maternal overweight and obesity: a survey of clinicians' characteristics and attitudes, and their responses to their pregnant clients | journal = BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth | volume = 13 | pages = 117 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23692981 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2393-13-117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmeid, et al, states that as doctors see more women of an unhealthy weight, they are less likely to advise healthy weight gain goals during [[pregnancy]], out of fear of [[Social stigma of obesity|fat-shaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmied VA, Duff M, Dahlen HG, Mills AE, Kolt GS | title = 'Not waving but drowning': a study of the experiences and concerns of midwives and other health professionals caring for obese childbearing women | journal = Midwifery | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 424–30 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 20381222 | doi = 10.1016/j.midw.2010.02.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mills A, Schmied VA, Dahlen HG | title = 'Get alongside us', women's experiences of being overweight and pregnant in Sydney, Australia | journal = Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–21 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 22168548 | doi = 10.1111/j.1740-8709.2011.00386.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the shift in society to accept women of all body types has been so slow, physicians may not be aware that they are not addressing the [[Gestational age|gestational]] weight gain as soon as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller M, Hearn L, van der Pligt P, Wilcox J, Campbell KJ | title = Preventing maternal and early childhood obesity: the fetal flaw in Australian perinatal care | journal = Australian Journal of Primary Health | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–7 | date = 2014-06-06 | pmid = 24176286 | doi = 10.1071/PY13080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous survey was conducted from January to April, 2010, of obstetrics and gynecology residents. Of those surveyed, only "7.6 percent selected correct BMI ranges for each category, and only 5.8 percent selected correct gestational weight gain ranges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore Simas TA, Waring ME, Sullivan GM, Liao X, Rosal MC, Hardy JR, Berry RE | title = Institute of medicine 2009 gestational weight gain guideline knowledge: survey of obstetrics/gynecology and family medicine residents of the United States | journal = Birth | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 237–46 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24344704 | pmc = 3974574 | doi = 10.1111/birt.12061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Family Businesses ===
Antheaume and Barbelivien described the creeping normality that destroys businesses, causing them to not see the subtle, negative shifts in the community around them. The authors state that owners of [[Family business|family businesses]] are more likely to notice the small changes than a large [[corporation]], however "detecting a problem is no guarantee of the ability to solve it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283300199_Why_do_family_businesses_die_An_investigation_through_the_work_of_an_ethnologist_and_geographer_on_the_collapse_of_human_societies |title=Why do family businesses die? An investigation through the work of an ethnologist and geographer on the collapse of human societies| vauthors = Antheaume N, Barbelivien D | website=Research Gate }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Cybercrime ===
In his thesis, Chon states that the increase in [[cybercrime]] fits the pattern for creeping normality. The number of websites involved in "[[Security hacker|hacking]] and cybercrime activities"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Chon K | date=June 2016|title=Cybercrime precursors: Towards a model of offender resources|url=|journal=Australian National University|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has increased at a slow and steady pace, mostly below society's awareness. 

=== IPS-Nathan Lecture Series ===
Peter Ho referred to creeping normality in his four-part [[Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore)|IPS]]-Nathan lecture series in spring of 2017. In regards to several issues that [[Singapore]] is facing, he claimed that "things get just a little bit worse each year than the year before, but not bad enough for anyone to notice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Challenges of Governance in a Complex World|last=Tan|first=Ariel|last2=Ho|first2=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company Pte Limited|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is through [[climate change]], where he stated that the country did not realize an increase of flooding was caused by rising temperatures, and not poor drainage as first suspected.

A '''cumulative flow diagram''' is a tool used in [[queuing theory]]. It is an [[area graph]] that depicts the quantity of work in a given state, showing arrivals, time in queue, quantity in queue, and departure.

Cumulative flow diagrams are seen in the literature of [[agile software development]] and [[lean product development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=David|title=Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business|year=2010|publisher=Blue Hole Press|location=Sequim, WA|isbn=978-0-9845214-0-1|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reinertsen|first=Donald|title=The Principles of Product Development Flow: Second Generation Lean Product Development|year=2009|publisher=Celeritas Publishing|location=Redondo Beach, CA|isbn=978-1-935401-00-1|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also seen in transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wikibooks|title=Fundamentals of Transportation/Queuing|url=http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fundamentals_of_Transportation/Queueing#Cumulative_Input-Output_Diagram_.28Newell_Curve.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some people consider a cumulative flow diagram to be a more sophisticated version of a  "burn up chart", which is the opposite of a [[burn down chart]]. A burn down chart tracks work remaining over time while burn up charts like the CFD track the growth (or shrinkage) of work in certain states over time. With its focus on tracking changes in queue size per state, the CFD has a stronger focus on identifying and rooting out the causes of dramatic changes in throughput.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reinertsen|first=Donald|title=The Principles of Product Development Flow: Second Generation Lean Product Development|year=2009|publisher=Celeritas Publishing|location=Redondo Beach, CA|isbn=978-1-935401-00-1|pages=72-73}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another term is "cumulative input-output diagram". The term "Newell curve" is also used, in reference to [[Gordon F. Newell]]. It is not known if Newell originated the curve.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10084">In [[mathematics]] and in particular [[Dynamical system|mathematical dynamics]], '''discrete time''' and '''continuous time''' are two alternative frameworks within which to model [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] that evolve over time.

==Discrete time==
[[Image:Sampled.signal.svg|right|thumb|Discrete sampled signal]]

'''Discrete time''' views values of variables as occurring at distinct, separate "points in time", or equivalently as being unchanged throughout each non-zero region of time ("time period")&amp;mdash;that is, time is viewed as a [[discrete variable]]. Thus a non-time variable jumps from one value to another as time moves from one time period to the next. This view of time corresponds to a digital clock that gives a fixed reading of 10:37 for a while, and then jumps to a new fixed reading of 10:38, etc. In this framework, each variable of interest is measured once at each time period. The number of measurements between any two time periods is finite. Measurements are typically made at sequential [[integer]] values of the variable "time".

A '''discrete signal''' or '''discrete-time signal''' is a [[time series]] consisting of a [[sequence]] of quantities.

Unlike a continuous-time signal, a discrete-time signal is not a function of a continuous argument; however, it may have been obtained by [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] from a continuous-time signal. When a discrete-time signal is obtained by sampling a sequence at uniformly spaced times, it has an associated [[sampling rate]].

Discrete-time signals may have several origins, but can usually be classified into one of two groups:&lt;ref&gt;"Digital Signal Processing" Prentice Hall - Pages 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

* By acquiring values of an [[analog signal]] at constant or variable rate. This process is called [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]].&lt;ref&gt;"Digital Signal Processing: Instant access." Butterworth-Heinemann - Page 8&lt;/ref&gt;
* By observing an inherently discrete-time process, such as the weekly peak value of a particular economic indicator.

==Continuous time==

In contrast, '''continuous time''' views variables as having a particular value for potentially only an [[infinitesimal]]ly short amount of time. Between any two points in time there are an [[infinity|infinite]] number of other points in time. The variable "time" ranges over the entire [[real number line]], or depending on the context, over some subset of it such as the non-negative reals. Thus time is viewed as a [[continuous variable]].

A '''continuous signal''' or a '''continuous-time signal''' is a varying [[quantity]] (a [[signal (information theory)|signal]]) 
whose domain, which is often time, is a [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]] (e.g., a [[connected space|connected]] interval of the [[real number|reals]]). That is, the function's domain is an [[uncountable set]]. The function itself need not be [[continuous function|continuous]]. To contrast, a [[discrete time]] signal has a [[countable set|countable]] domain, like the [[natural number]]s.

A signal of continuous amplitude and time is known as a continuous-time signal or an [[analog signal]]. This (a [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]) will have some value at every instant of time. The electrical signals derived in proportion with the physical quantities such as temperature, pressure, sound etc. are generally continuous signals. Other examples of continuous signals are sine wave, cosine wave, triangular wave etc. 

The signal is defined over a domain, which may or may not be finite, and there is a functional mapping from the domain to the value of the signal. The continuity of the time variable, in connection with the law of density of [[real numbers]], means that the signal value can be found at any arbitrary point in time.

A typical example of an infinite duration signal is:

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \sin(t), \quad t \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

A finite duration counterpart of the above signal could be:

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \sin(t), \quad t \in [-\pi,\pi]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.

The value of a finite (or infinite) duration signal may or may not be finite. For example,

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac{1}{t}, \quad t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise,

is a finite duration signal but it takes an infinite value for &lt;math&gt;t = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;. 

In many disciplines, the convention is that a continuous signal must always have a finite value, which makes more sense in the case of physical signals.

For some purposes, infinite singularities are acceptable as long as the signal is integrable over any finite interval (for example, the &lt;math&gt;t^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; signal is not integrable at infinity, but &lt;math&gt;t^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; is).

Any analog signal is continuous by nature. [[Discrete-time signal]]s, used in [[digital signal processing]], can be obtained by [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] and [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] of continuous signals.

Continuous signal may also be defined over an independent variable other than time. Another very common independent variable is space and is particularly useful in [[image processing]], where two  space dimensions are used.

==Relevant contexts==

Discrete time is often employed when [[empirical]] [[measurement]]s are involved, because normally it is only possible to measure variables sequentially. For example, while [[economic activity]] actually occurs continuously, there being no moment when the economy is totally in a pause, it is only possible to measure economic activity discretely. For this reason, published data on, for example, [[gross domestic product]] will show a sequence of [[Calendar year#Quarters|quarterly]] values.

When one attempts to empirically explain such variables in terms of other variables and/or their own prior values, one uses [[time series]] or [[regression analysis|regression]] methods in which variables are indexed with a subscript indicating the time period in which the observation occurred. For example, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; might refer to the value of [[income]] observed in unspecified time period ''t'', ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; to the value of income observed in the third time period, etc.

Moreover, when a researcher attempts to develop a theory to explain what is observed in discrete time, often the theory itself is expressed in discrete time in order to facilitate the development of a time series or regression model.

On the other hand, it is often more mathematically [[Closed form solution|tractable]] to construct [[Scientific theory|theoretical model]]s in continuous time, and often in areas such as [[physics]] an exact description requires the use of continuous time. In a continuous time context, the value of a variable ''y'' at an unspecified point in time is denoted as ''y''(''t'') or, when the meaning is clear, simply as ''y''.

==Types of equations==

===Discrete time===

Discrete time makes use of [[difference equation]]s, also known as recurrence relations. An example, known as the [[logistic map]] or logistic equation, is

:&lt;math&gt; x_{t+1} = rx_t(1-x_t),&lt;/math&gt;

in which ''r'' is a [[Parameter#Mathematical functions|parameter]] in the range from 2 to 4 inclusive, and ''x'' is a variable in the range from 0 to 1 inclusive whose value in period ''t'' [[nonlinearity|nonlinearly]] affects its value in the next period, ''t''+1. For example, if &lt;math&gt;r=4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_1 = 1/3&lt;/math&gt;, then for ''t''=1 we have &lt;math&gt;x_2=4(1/3)(2/3)=8/9&lt;/math&gt;, and for ''t''=2 we have &lt;math&gt;x_3=4(8/9)(1/9)=32/81&lt;/math&gt;.

Another example models the adjustment of a [[price]] ''P'' in response to non-zero [[excess demand]] for a product as

:&lt;math&gt;P_{t+1} = P_t + \delta \cdot f(P_t,...)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the positive speed-of-adjustment parameter which is less than or equal to 1, and where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[excess demand function]].

===Continuous time===

Continuous time makes use of [[differential equation]]s. For example, the adjustment of a price ''P'' in response to non-zero excess demand for a product can be modeled in continuous time as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=\lambda \cdot f(P,...)&lt;/math&gt;

where the left side is the [[first derivative]] of the price with respect to time (that is, the rate of change of the price), &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the speed-of-adjustment parameter which can be any positive finite number, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is again the excess demand function.

A variable measured in discrete time can be plotted as a [[step function]], in which each time period is given a region on the [[horizontal axis]] of the same length as every other time period, and the measured variable is plotted as a height that stays constant throughout the region of the time period. In this graphical technique, the graph appears as a sequence of horizontal steps. Alternatively, each time period can be viewed as a detached point in time, usually at an integer value on the horizontal axis, and the measured variable is plotted as a height above that time-axis point. In this technique, the graph appears as a set of dots.

The values of a variable measured in continuous time are plotted as a [[continuous function]], since the domain of time is considered to be the entire real axis or at least some connected portion of it.

In [[philanthropy]], '''donor intent''' is the purpose, sometimes publicly expressed, for which a philanthropist intends a [[grant (money)|charitable gift]] or [[bequest]]. Donor intent is most often expressed in gift restrictions, terms, or agreements between a donor and donee, but it may also be expressed separately in the words, actions, beliefs, and giving practices of a philanthropist. Donor intent is protected in American law regarding [[charitable trust]]s, and trustees' primary fiduciary obligation is to carry out a donor's wishes.&lt;ref name=Madoff&gt;{{cite book|last=Madoff|first=Ray D.|title=Immortality and the Law: The Rising Power of the American Dead|year=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=978-0-300-12184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fidelity to donor intent is sometimes distinguished from grant compliance, and "donor intent" refers to the actions of a grantmaking entity and grant compliance refers to the actions of a grant recipient, but the term donor intent is commonly used to refer to both the guiding principles of a grantmaking entity and the purposes of a specific gift.&lt;ref name=Cain&gt;{{cite book|last=Cain|first=Jeffrey J.|title=Protecting Donor Intent: How to Define and Safeguard Your Philanthropic Principles|year=2012|publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-9851265-0-6|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/guidebook/protecting_donor_intent/foundation_management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many controversies, including litigation, over donor intent at [[private foundation (United States)|private foundations]], [[higher education|universities]], and arts organizations.&lt;ref name=Wooster&gt;{{cite book|last=Wooster|first=Martin Morse|title=The Great Philanthropists and the Problem of "Donor Intent"|year=2007|publisher=Capital Research Center|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1-892934-12-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CEHE&gt;{{cite web|title=Resources on Donor Intent|url=http://www.cehe.org/resources/|publisher=Center for Excellence in Higher Education|accessdate=6 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414113720/http://www.cehe.org/resources/|archivedate=14 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DI Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Donor Intent Resource Library|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/donor_intent/donor_intent_resource_library|publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor==
Donor intent has been defended as a moral obligation between giver and recipient. Defenders of donor intent argue that on a basic ethical level, trustees and gift recipients must do what they have agreed with the original donor to do, explicitly or implicitly: "When donor intent is violated, and particularly when it is egregiously violated, it undermines the bedrock trust on which all charitable giving rests."&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

Donor intent is thus also defended as necessary to ensure future charitable giving.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frumkin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frumkin|first=Peter|title=Strategic Giving: The Art and Science of Philanthropy|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill.|isbn=978-0-226-26626-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future donors might not be inclined to leave money to charitable causes if they see that trustees, grant recipients, or policymakers do not respect the stated intent. [[Peter Frumkin]] has written that "as s a policy tool for encouraging future giving, protection of a donor's intent is needed to give future philanthropists the confidence they need to pass their wealth on to others to administer."[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gv9ejrvJf7AC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=%22the+confidence+they+need+to+pass+their+wealth+on+to+others+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k7M4KJDe55&amp;sig=4pK8KZcH4GnZQSUCnzoc4Pk7uLM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4n1CU5KqLoGy7Ab_zYD4Bw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20confidence%20they%20need%20to%20pass%20their%20wealth%20on%20to%20others%20%22&amp;f=false] [[Carl Schramm]], former president of the [[Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation]], has said on donor intent, "If we dont recognize it, we discourage wealthy people from creating foundations in the future."&lt;ref name=Schramm&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schramm|first=Carl|title=Examining the Role of Foundations in a Free Society|journal=Philanthropy|date=November–December 2007|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/examining_the_role_of_foundations_in_a_free_society|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survey data of Americans indicates that donor intent and grant compliance are valued by the public. When asked by [[Zogby International|Zogby]] if they would stop giving money to a charity that ignored a request to use a previous donation for a specific purpose, 53% said they would "definitely stop giving" and an additional 25.7% would "probably stop giving." When pollsters asked, "How important do you think showing respect for a donor's wishes is to the ethical governance of nonprofit charitable organizations?," 82.9% considered it "very important," 14.6% "somewhat important."&lt;ref name=Zogby&gt;{{cite web|title=Zogby America Adults 11/20/05 to 11/22/05|url=http://www.cehe.org/resources/ZogbyResults.pdf|publisher=Zogby International|accessdate=7 March 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, respect for donor intent is defended as necessary to preserve pluralism in [[civil society]]: "Those who take the idea of donor intent seriously believe that only by protecting the idiosyncratic and at times outlandish ideas of donors will it be possible for philanthropy to innovate and pursue ideas that are either ahead of or behind their time," Frumkin has said.&lt;ref name=Frumkin /&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyerson-2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyerson|first=Adam|title=How Foundations Should and Should Not Be Held Accountable|journal=Philanthropy|date=Fall 2009|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/philanthropic_freedom/how_foundations_should_and_should_not_be_held_accountable|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against==
Many arguments against donor intent are made against honoring it in perpetuity.&lt;ref name=Madoff /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenwald&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenwald|first=Julius|title=Principles of Public Giving|journal=The Atlantic Monthly|date=May 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments date back at least to the 18th century and French economist [[Jacques Turgot]]: "No work of man is made for immortality; and since foundations, always multiplied by vanity, would in the long run, if uninterfered with, absorb all funds and private properties, it would be absolutely necessary at last to destroy them."&lt;ref name=Turgot&gt;{{cite book|title=Giving Well, Doing Good|year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=978-0-253-21955-8|pages=333–338|author=Turgot, Jacques|editor=Amy Kass|chapter=Endowments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not arguing against donor intent ''per se'', [[Julius Rosenwald]] criticized philanthropic funds that are established in perpetuity, arguing that narrowly defined statements of donor intent can be superseded as situations change: " I have heard of a fund which provides a baked potato at each meal for each young woman at [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], and of another, dating from one of the great families, which pays for half a loaf of bread deposited each day at the door of each student in one of the colleges of [[Oxford University|Oxford]].... The list of these precisely focused gifts which have lost their usefulness could be extended into volumes."&lt;ref name=Rosenwald /&gt;

Another argument against donor intent relates to whether limitations may be placed on donors' purposes, either prudential or legal. In [[Augustus Octavius Bacon#Legacy|''Evans v. Abney'']], the Supreme Court held that [[Augustus Octavius Bacon]]'s clearly defined gift of a park to [[Macon, Georgia]], for whites only was illegal under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and so the gift reverted to Bacon’s heirs. In cases that donor intent can be modified, courts have latitude to do that under ''[[cy pres]]'' doctrine. Finally, some critics of donor intent argue that it cements [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref name=Ogden&gt;{{cite web|last=Ogden|first=Tim|title=The Thorny Problem of Donor Intent|url=http://www.philanthropyaction.com/nc/the_thorny_problem_of_donor_intent/|publisher=Philanthropy Action|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetuating donor intent ==
Donor intent is considered virtually impossible to be maintained in perpetuity because of changing situations, erosion of capital, and the distance of successor trustees from a donor. In some instances, however, donor intent has been lost only a short time after a donor's death. Waldemar Nielsen has argued that the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] swiftly lost the "democratic, hopeful, and constructive" spirit of [[Andrew Carnegie]]'s giving: "That within five years of his death his Corporation should have turned into a racist and reactionary machine to defend the privileges of the old [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] elite and block the advancement of immigrants and the underprivileged deformed his spirit and intent."&lt;ref name=Nielsen&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ethics of Giving and Receiving: Am I My Foolish Brother's Keeper?|year=2000|publisher=SMU Press|location=Dallas|pages=96–107|author=Nielsen, Waldemar|editor=William F. May and A. Lewis Soens Jr.|chapter=The Ethics of Philanthropy and Trusteeship; The Carnegie Foundation: A Case Study}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, the [[Daniels Fund]], established by [[Bill Daniels]], drifted away from what Daniels' trustees considered to be his principles, and the drift was arrested by board action.&lt;ref name=Sparks-Daniels&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Evan|title=Back to Bill|journal=Philanthropy|date=Fall 2011|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/donor_intent/back_to_bill|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gose&gt;{{cite news|last=Gose|first=Ben|title=Changes at Denver's Daniels Fund: Politics or Prudence?|newspaper=Chronicle of Philanthropy|date=February 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


Some donors have adopted strategies to prevent philanthropies that they create from drifting from donor intent.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

=== Sunsetting versus perpetuity ===
Rosenwald cautioned donors against perpetuity: "I am opposed to gifts in perpetuity for any purpose."&lt;ref name=Rosenwald /&gt; Some donors have attempted to preserve their intent either by "giving while living"&lt;ref name=Feeney&gt;{{cite web|title=Turning Passion into Action: Giving While Living|url=http://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/sites/default/files/uploads/GWL_050510_1723%20%282%29.pdf|work=Atlantic Reports|publisher=Atlantic Philanthropies|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by establishing a date or timeframe in the future by which a foundation must disburse its assets, or "sunset." [[Chuck Feeney]] founded the [[Atlantic Philanthropies]], which is scheduled to spend down its assets by 2017. In 1975, inspired by the controversy over donor intent at the Ford Foundation, [[John M. Olin]] adopted plans for the [[John M. Olin Foundation]] to disburse its assets by 2005. Olin believed that capitalism was the basis of prosperity and sought to promote [[conservative]] political and legal thinking.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=John J.|title=A Gift of Freedom: How the John M. Olin Foundation Changed America|year=2006|publisher=Encounter Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=1-59403-117-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spend-down plan gave the Olin Foundation the spending profile of a foundation with three times as many assets, Jeffrey Cain has written: "The Olin Foundation made a deliberate decision to have a profound impact on its time, rather than a lighter one that spanned years into the future."&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

=== Mission statements ===
Carnegie left the Carnegie Corporation's mission vague and open-ended by instructing his successors to "promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding" but also granting "full authority to change policies or causes hitherto aided, from time to time, when this, in their opinion, has become necessary or desirable. They shall best conform to my wishes by using their own judgment."&lt;ref name="Carnegie Mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and Vision|url=http://carnegie.org/about-us/mission-and-vision/|publisher=Carnegie Corporation of New York|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In creating the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], [[John D. MacArthur]] reportedly told his lawyer, "I'll make [the money]. But you people, after I'm dead, will have to learn how to spend it."&lt;ref name=Wooster /&gt;

Other donors are much narrower. [[James B. Duke]] specified percentages of the annual payout that would go to various categories of giving by the [[Duke Endowment]], including even a formula for reimbursing charity [[hospital]]s.&lt;ref name=Sparks-Duke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Evan|title=Duke of Carolina|journal=Philanthropy|date=Winter 2011|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/donor_intent/duke_of_carolina|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some donors leave detailed documents to supplement official [[mission statement]]s, including reflections on their principles, video statements, and records of their personal giving.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

=== Trustees and staff ===
Often, donors select family members, personal business associates, lawyers, or nonprofit leaders to serve on their boards.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt; The Daniels Fund requires trustees to sign a statement affirming that they understand Bill Daniels' donor intent and will honor it in their decision-making on behalf of the foundation.&lt;ref name=Sparks-Daniels /&gt; The foundation that was created by [[Lloyd Noble]] recruits [[apprentice]] trustees to shadow the actual board; some are elected to the board in the future.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt; At meetings of the Duke Endowment's board, James B. Duke's original [[tust instrument|indenture of trust]] is read aloud to reinforce his intentions.&lt;ref name=Sparks-Duke /&gt; The [[John Templeton Foundation]] has a provision for periodic "donor intent audits" to ensure its officers uphold [[John Templeton]]'s purposes.&lt;ref name=Cain /&gt;

The '''elementary effects (EE) method''' is the most used{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} screening method in [[sensitivity analysis]]. It is applied to identify non-influential inputs for a computationally costly [[mathematical model]] or for a model with a large number of inputs, where the costs of estimating other sensitivity analysis measures such as the variance-based measures is not affordable. Like all screening, the EE method provides qualitative sensitivity analysis measures, i.e. measures which allow the identification of non-influential inputs or which allow to rank the input factors in order of importance, but do not quantify exactly the relative importance of the inputs.

==Methodology==

To exemplify the EE method, let us assume to consider a mathematical model with &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; input factors. Let &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; be the output of interest (a scalar for simplicity):

: &lt;math&gt; Y = f(X_1, X_2, ... X_k).&lt;/math&gt;

The original EE method of Morris &lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. D. (1991). Factorial sampling plans for preliminary computational experiments. ''Technometrics'', '''33''', 161–174.&lt;/ref&gt; provides two sensitivity measures for each input factor:

* the measure &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;, assessing the overall importance of an input factor on the model output;
* the measure &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;, describing non-linear effects and interactions.

These two measures are obtained through a design based on the construction of a series of trajectories in the space of the inputs, where inputs are randomly moved One-At-a-Time (OAT).
In this design, each model input is assumed to vary across &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; selected levels in the space of the input factors. The region of experimentation &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is thus a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-level grid.

Each trajectory is composed of &lt;math&gt;(k+1)&lt;/math&gt; points since input factors move one by one of a step &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1/(p-1), 2/(p-1),..., 1\}&lt;/math&gt; while all the others remain fixed.

Along each trajectory the so-called ''elementary effect'' for each input factor is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; d_i(X) = \frac{Y(X_1, \ldots ,X_{i-1}, X_i + \Delta, X_{i+1}, \ldots, X_k ) - Y( \mathbf X)}{\Delta} &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} = (X_1, X_2, ... X_k)&lt;/math&gt; is any selected value in &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; such that the transformed point is still in &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; for each index &lt;math&gt; i=1,\ldots, k. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; elementary effects are estimated for each input &lt;math&gt; d_i\left(X^{(1)} \right), d_i\left( X^{(2)} \right), \ldots, d_i\left( X^{(r)} \right) &lt;/math&gt; by randomly sampling &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; points &lt;math&gt; X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}, \ldots , X^{(r)}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Usually &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; ~ 4-10, depending on the number of input factors, on the computational cost of the model and on the choice of the number of levels &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt;, since a high number of levels to be explored needs to be balanced by a high number of trajectories, in order to obtain an exploratory sample. It is demonstrated that a convenient choice for the parameters &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; even and &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;
p/[2(p-1)]&lt;/math&gt;, as this ensures equal probability of sampling in the input space.

In case input factors are not uniformly distributed, the best practice is to sample in the space of the quantiles and to obtain the inputs values using inverse cumulative distribution functions. Note that in this case &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; equals the step taken by the inputs in the space of the quantiles.

The two measures &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; are defined as the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution of the elementary effects of each input:&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mu_i = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{j=1}^r d_i \left( X^{(j)} \right) &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_i = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{(r-1)} \sum_{j=1}^r \left( d_i \left( X^{(j)} \right) - \mu_i \right)^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

These two measures need to be read together (e.g. on a two-dimensional graph) in order to rank input factors in order of importance and identify those inputs which do not influence the output variability. Low values of both &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; correspond to a non-influent input.

An improvement of this method was developed by Campolongo et al.&lt;ref&gt;Campolongo, F., J. Cariboni, and A. Saltelli (2007). An effective screening design for sensitivity analysis of large models. ''Environmental Modelling and Software'', '''22''',
1509&amp;ndash;1518.&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed a revised measure &lt;math&gt; \mu^* &lt;/math&gt;, which on its own is sufficient to provide a reliable ranking of the input factors. The revised measure is the mean of the distribution of the absolute values of the elementary effects of the input factors:&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mu_i^* = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{j=1}^r \left| d_i \left( X^{(j)} \right) \right| &lt;/math&gt;.
The use of &lt;math&gt; \mu^* &lt;/math&gt; solves the problem of the effects of opposite signs which occurs when the model is non-monotonic and which can cancel each other out, thus resulting in a low value for &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;.

An efficient technical scheme to construct the trajectories used in the EE method is presented in the original paper by Morris while an improvement strategy aimed at better exploring the input space is proposed by Campolongo et al..

In [[special relativity]], a '''four-vector''' (also known as a 4-vector)&lt;ref&gt;Rindler, W. ''Introduction to Special Relativity (2nd edn.)'' (1991) Clarendon Press Oxford {{ISBN|0-19-853952-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an object with four components, which transform in a specific way under [[Lorentz transformation]]. Specifically, a four-vector is an element of a four-dimensional [[vector space]] considered as a [[representation space]] of the [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|standard representation]] of the [[Lorentz group]], the (½,½) representation. It differs from a [[Euclidean vector]] in how its magnitude is determined. The transformations that preserve this magnitude are the Lorentz transformations, which include [[Rotation group SO(3)|spatial rotations]] and [[Lorentz transformation#Boost in the x-direction|boosts]] (a change by a constant velocity to another [[inertial reference frame]]).&lt;ref name="BaskalKim2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sibel Baskal|author2=Young S Kim|author3=Marilyn E Noz|title=Physics of the Lorentz Group|date=1 November 2015|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers|isbn=978-1-68174-062-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ch1}}

Four-vectors describe, for instance, position {{math|''x''{{i sup|''μ''}}}} in spacetime modeled as [[Minkowski space]], a particle's [[four-momentum]] {{math|''p''{{i sup|''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, the amplitude of the [[electromagnetic four-potential]] {{math|''A''{{i sup|''μ''}}(''x'')}} at a point {{mvar|x}} in spacetime, and the elements of the subspace spanned by the [[gamma matrices]] inside the [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Induced representations|Dirac algebra]].

The Lorentz group may be represented by 4×4 matrices {{math|Λ}}. The action of a Lorentz transformation on a general [[contravariant vector|contravariant]] four-vector {{mvar|X}} (like the examples above), regarded as a column vector with [[Cartesian coordinates]] with respect to an [[Inertial frame#Special relativity|inertial frame]] in the entries, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;X^\prime = \Lambda X,&lt;/math&gt;

(matrix multiplication) where the components of the primed object refer to the new frame. Related to the examples above that are given as contravariant vectors, there are also the corresponding [[covariant vector]]s {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}. These transform according to the rule

:&lt;math&gt;X^\prime = {(\Lambda^{-1})}^\mathrm T X,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes the [[matrix transpose]]. This rule is different from the above rule. It corresponds to the [[dual representation]] of the standard representation. However, for the Lorentz group the dual of any representation is [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Dual representations|equivalent]] to the original representation. Thus the objects with covariant indices are four-vectors as well.

For an example of a well-behaved four-component object in special relativity that is ''not'' a four-vector, see [[bispinor]]. It is similarly defined, the difference being that the transformation rule under Lorentz transformations is given by a representation other than the standard representation. In this case, the rule reads {{math|''X''{{′}} {{=}} Π(Λ)''X''}}, where {{math|Π(Λ)}} is a 4×4 matrix other than {{math|Λ}}. Similar remarks apply to objects with fewer or more components that are well-behaved under Lorentz transformations. These include [[scalar field|scalar]]s, [[spinor]]s, [[tensors]] and spinor-tensors.

The article considers four-vectors in the context of special relativity. Although the concept of four-vectors also extends to [[general relativity]], some of the results stated in this article require modification in general relativity. &lt;!-- TO DO: provide a GR section for this article! --&gt;

The notations in this article are: lowercase bold for [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] vectors, hats for three-dimensional [[unit vector]]s, capital bold for [[Spacetime|four dimensional]] vectors (except for the four-gradient), and [[tensor index notation]].

== Four-vector algebra ==

===Four-vectors in a real-valued basis===

A '''four-vector''' ''A'' is a vector with a "timelike" component and three "spacelike" components, and can be written in various equivalent notations:&lt;ref&gt;Relativity DeMystified, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (BSA), 2006, {{ISBN|0-07-145545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = (A^0, \, A^1, \, A^2, \, A^3) \\
&amp; = A^0\mathbf{E}_0 + A^1 \mathbf{E}_1 + A^2 \mathbf{E}_2 + A^3  \mathbf{E}_3 \\
&amp; = A^0\mathbf{E}_0 + A^i \mathbf{E}_i \\
&amp; = A^\alpha\mathbf{E}_\alpha\\
&amp; = A^\mu  
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where in the last form the magnitude component and [[basis vector]] have been combined to a single element.

The upper indices indicate [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] components. Here the standard convention is that Latin indices take values for spatial components, so that ''i'' = 1, 2, 3, and Greek indices take values for space ''and time'' components, so ''α'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, used with the [[summation convention]]. The split between the time component and the spatial components is a useful one to make when determining contractions of one four vector with other tensor quantities, such as for calculating Lorentz invariants in inner products (examples are given below), or [[raising and lowering indices]].

In special relativity, the spacelike basis '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and components ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''A''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are often [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian]] basis and components:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = (A_t, \, A_x, \, A_y, \, A_z) \\
&amp; = A_t \mathbf{E}_t + A_x \mathbf{E}_x + A_y \mathbf{E}_y + A_z  \mathbf{E}_z \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

although, of course, any other basis and components may be used, such as [[spherical polar coordinates]]

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = (A_t, \, A_r, \, A_\theta, \, A_\phi) \\
&amp; = A_t \mathbf{E}_t + A_r \mathbf{E}_r + A_\theta \mathbf{E}_\theta + A_\phi \mathbf{E}_\phi \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or [[cylindrical polar coordinates]],

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = (A_t, \, A_r, \, A_\theta, \, A_z) \\
&amp; = A_t \mathbf{E}_t + A_r \mathbf{E}_r + A_\theta \mathbf{E}_\theta + A_z \mathbf{E}_z \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or any other [[orthogonal coordinates]], or even general [[curvilinear coordinates]]. Note the coordinate labels are always subscripted as labels and are not indices taking numerical values. In general relativity, local curvilinear coordinates in a local basis must be used. Geometrically, a four-vector can still be interpreted as an arrow, but in spacetime - not just space. In relativity, the arrows are drawn as part of  [[Minkowski diagram]] (also called ''spacetime diagram''). In this article, four-vectors will be referred to simply as vectors.

It is also customary to represent the bases by [[column vector]]s:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{E}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{E}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{E}_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

so that:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} A^0 \\ A^1 \\ A^2 \\ A^3 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

The relation between the [[covariant vector|covariant]] and contravariant coordinates is through the [[Minkowski metric|Minkowski]] [[metric tensor]] (referred to as the metric), ''η'' which [[raising and lowering indices|raises and lowers indices]] as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\mu} =  \eta_{\mu \nu} A^{\nu} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and in various equivalent notations the covariant components are:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = (A_0, \, A_1, \, A_2, \, A_3) \\
&amp; = A_0\mathbf{E}^0 + A_1 \mathbf{E}^1 + A_2 \mathbf{E}^2 + A_3  \mathbf{E}^3 \\
&amp; = A_0\mathbf{E}^0 + A_i \mathbf{E}^i \\
&amp; = A_\alpha\mathbf{E}^\alpha\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the lowered index indicates it to be [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]]. Often the metric is diagonal, as is the case for [[orthogonal coordinates]] (see [[line element]]), but not in general [[curvilinear coordinates]].

The bases can be represented by [[row vector]]s:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}^0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{E}^1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{E}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{E}^3 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

so that:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} A_0 &amp; A_1 &amp; A_2 &amp; A_3 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

The motivation for the above conventions are that the inner product is a scalar, see below for details.

=== Lorentz transformation ===

{{main|Lorentz transformation}}

Given two inertial or rotated [[frame of reference|frames of reference]], a four-vector is defined as a quantity which transforms according to the [[Lorentz transformation]] matrix&amp;nbsp;'''Λ''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}'=\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

In index notation, the contravariant and covariant components transform according to, respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;{A'}^\mu = \Lambda^\mu {}_\nu A^\nu \,, \quad{A'}_\mu =  \Lambda_\mu {}^\nu A_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

in which the matrix '''Λ''' has components Λ''&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' in row&amp;nbsp;''μ'' and column&amp;nbsp;''ν'', and the [[inverse matrix]] '''Λ'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; has components Λ''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ν&lt;/sup&gt;'' in row&amp;nbsp;''μ'' and column&amp;nbsp;''ν''.

For background on the nature of this transformation definition, see [[tensor#Definition|tensor]]. All four-vectors transform in the same way, and this can be generalized to four-dimensional relativistic tensors; see [[Special relativity#Transformations of physical quantities between reference frames|special relativity]].

====Pure rotations about an arbitrary axis ====

For two frames rotated by a fixed angle ''θ'' about an axis defined by the [[unit vector]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}} = (\hat{n}_1,\hat{n}_2,\hat{n}_3)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

without any boosts, the matrix '''Λ''' has components given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=C.B. Parker| title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics| publisher=McGraw Hill|edition=2nd|page=1333|year=1994| isbn=0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{00} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda_{0i} = \Lambda_{i0} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{ij} = (\delta_{ij} - \hat{n}_i \hat{n}_j) \cos\theta - \varepsilon_{ijk} \hat{n}_k \sin\theta  + \hat{n}_i \hat{n}_j &lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]], and ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[three-dimensional]] [[Levi-Civita symbol]]. The spacelike components of four-vectors are rotated, while the timelike components remain unchanged.

For the case of rotations about the ''z''-axis only, the spacelike part of the Lorentz matrix reduces to the [[rotation matrix]] about the ''z''-axis:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
{A'}^0 \\ {A'}^1 \\ {A'}^2 \\ {A'}^3
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos\theta &amp;-\sin\theta &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
A^0 \\ A^1 \\ A^2 \\ A^3
\end{pmatrix}\ .
&lt;/math&gt;

====Pure boosts in an arbitrary direction====

[[File:Standard conf.png|right|thumb|300px|Standard configuration of coordinate systems; for a Lorentz boost in the ''x''-direction.]]

For two frames moving at constant relative three-velocity '''v''' (not four-velocity, [[#Four-velocity|see below]]), it is convenient to denote and define the relative velocity in units of ''c'' by:

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\beta} = (\beta_1,\,\beta_2,\,\beta_3) = \frac{1}{c}(v_1,\,v_2,\,v_3) = \frac{1}{c}\mathbf{v} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Then without rotations, the matrix '''Λ''' has components given by:&lt;ref&gt;Gravitation, J.B. Wheeler, C. Misner, K.S. Thorne, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co, 1973, ISAN 0-7167-0344-0&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \Lambda_{00} &amp; = \gamma, \\
\Lambda_{0i} &amp; = \Lambda_{i0} = - \gamma \beta_{i}, \\
\Lambda_{ij} &amp; = \Lambda_{ji} = ( \gamma - 1 )\dfrac{\beta_{i}\beta_{j}}{\beta^{2}} + \delta_{ij}= ( \gamma - 1 )\dfrac{v_i v_j}{v^2} + \delta_{ij}, \\
\end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Lorentz factor]] is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1- \boldsymbol{\beta}\cdot\boldsymbol{\beta}}} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and ''δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]]. Contrary to the case for pure rotations, the spacelike and timelike components are mixed together under boosts.

For the case of a boost in the ''x''-direction only, the matrix reduces to;&lt;ref&gt;Dynamics and Relativity, J.R. Forshaw, B.G. Smith, Wiley, 2009, ISAN 978-0-470-01460-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Relativity DeMystified, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (ASB), 2006, ISAN 0-07-145545-0&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
A'^0 \\ A'^1 \\ A'^2 \\ A'^3
\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix}
\cosh\phi &amp;-\sinh\phi &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
-\sinh\phi  &amp; \cosh\phi &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
A^0 \\ A^1 \\ A^2 \\ A^3
\end{pmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Where the [[rapidity]] ''ϕ'' expression has been used, written in terms of the [[hyperbolic function]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma = \cosh \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

This Lorentz matrix illustrates the boost to be a ''[[hyperbolic rotation]]'' in four dimensional spacetime, analogous to the circular rotation above in three-dimensional space.

===Properties===

====Linearity====

Four-vectors have the same [[Linear algebra|linearity properties]] as [[Euclidean vector]]s in [[three dimensions]]. They can be added in the usual entrywise way:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B} = (A^0, A^1, A^2,A^3) + (B^0, B^1, B^2,B^3) = (A^0 + B^0, A^1 + B^1, A^2 + B^2, A^3 + B^3)  &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly [[scalar multiplication]] by a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] ''λ'' is defined entrywise by:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda\mathbf{A} = \lambda(A^0, A^1, A^2,A^3) = (\lambda A^0, \lambda A^1, \lambda A^2, \lambda A^3) &lt;/math&gt;

Then subtraction is the inverse operation of addition, defined entrywise by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}+(-1)\mathbf{B} = (A^0, A^1, A^2,A^3) + (-1)(B^0, B^1, B^2,B^3) = (A^0 - B^0, A^1 - B^1, A^2 - B^2, A^3 - B^3)  &lt;/math&gt;

====Minkowski tensor====

{{See also|spacetime interval}}

Applying the [[Minkowski tensor]] ''η&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;'' to two four-vectors '''A''' and '''B''', writing the result in [[dot product]] notation, we have, using [[Einstein notation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = A^{\mu} \eta_{\mu \nu} B^{\nu} &lt;/math&gt;

It is convenient to rewrite the definition in [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot B} = \begin{pmatrix} A^0 &amp; A^1 &amp; A^2 &amp; A^3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \eta_{00} &amp; \eta_{01} &amp; \eta_{02} &amp; \eta_{03} \\ \eta_{10} &amp; \eta_{11} &amp; \eta_{12} &amp; \eta_{13} \\ \eta_{20} &amp; \eta_{21} &amp; \eta_{22} &amp; \eta_{23} \\ \eta_{30} &amp; \eta_{31} &amp; \eta_{32} &amp; \eta_{33} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} B^0 \\ B^1 \\ B^2 \\ B^3 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

in which case ''η&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;'' above is the entry in row ''μ'' and column ''ν'' of the Minkowski metric as a square matrix. The Minkowski metric is not a [[Euclidean metric]], because it is indefinite (see [[metric signature]]). A number of other expressions can be used because the metric tensor can raise and lower the components of '''A''' or '''B'''. For contra/co-variant components of '''A''' and co/contra-variant components of '''B''', we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = A^{\mu} \eta_{\mu \nu} B^{\nu} = A_{\nu} B^{\nu} = A^{\mu} B_{\mu} &lt;/math&gt;

so in the matrix notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot B} = \begin{pmatrix} A_0 &amp; A_1 &amp; A_2 &amp; A_3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} B^0 \\ B^1 \\ B^2 \\ B^3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} B_0 &amp; B_1 &amp; B_2 &amp; B_3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A^0 \\ A^1 \\ A^2 \\ A^3 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

while for '''A''' and '''B''' each in covariant components:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = A_{\mu} \eta^{\mu \nu} B_{\nu} &lt;/math&gt;

with a similar matrix expression to the above.

Applying the Minkowski tensor to a four-vector '''A''' with itself we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} = A^\mu \eta_{\mu\nu} A^\nu &lt;/math&gt;

which, depending on the case, may be considered the square, or its negative, of the length of the vector.

Following are two common choices for the metric tensor in the [[Minkowski space#Standard basis|standard basis]] (essentially Cartesian coordinates). If orthogonal coordinates are used, there would be scale factors along the diagonal part of the spacelike part of the metric, while for general curvilinear coordinates the entire spacelike part of the metric would have components dependent on the curvilinear basis used.

=====Standard basis, (+−−−) signature=====

In the (+−−−) [[metric signature]], evaluating the [[Einstein notation|summation over indices]] gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} =  A^0 B^0 - A^1 B^1 - A^2 B^2 - A^3 B^3  &lt;/math&gt;

while in matrix form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot B} = \begin{pmatrix} A^0 &amp; A^1 &amp; A^2 &amp; A^3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} B^0 \\ B^1 \\ B^2 \\ B^3 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

It is a recurring theme in special relativity to take the expression

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{B} = A^0 B^0 - A^1 B^1 - A^2 B^2 - A^3 B^3 = C&lt;/math&gt;

in one [[Frame of reference|reference frame]], where ''C'' is the value of the inner product in this frame, and:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}'\cdot\mathbf{B}' = {A'}^0 {B'}^0 - {A'}^1 {B'}^1 - {A'}^2 {B'}^2 - {A'}^3 {B'}^3 = C' &lt;/math&gt;

in another frame, in which ''C''&amp;prime; is the value of the inner product in this frame. Then since the inner product is an invariant, these must be equal:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{A}'\cdot\mathbf{B}' &lt;/math&gt;

that is:

:&lt;math&gt; C = A^0 B^0 - A^1 B^1 - A^2 B^2 - A^3 B^3 = {A'}^0 {B'}^0 - {A'}^1 {B'}^1 - {A'}^2 {B'}^2 - {A'}^3{B'}^3 &lt;/math&gt;

Considering that physical quantities in relativity are four-vectors, this equation has the appearance of a "[[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]", but there is no "conservation" involved. The primary significance of the Minkowski inner product is that for any two four-vectors, its value is [[invariant (physics)|invariant]] for all observers; a change of coordinates does not result in a change in value of the inner product. The components of the four-vectors change from one frame to another; '''A''' and '''A'''&amp;prime; are connected by a [[Lorentz transformation]], and similarly for '''B''' and '''B'''&amp;prime;, although the inner products are the same in all frames. Nevertheless, this type of expression is exploited in relativistic calculations on a par with conservation laws, since the magnitudes of components can be determined without explicitly performing any Lorentz transformations. A particular example is with energy and momentum in the [[energy-momentum relation]] derived from the [[four-momentum]] vector (see also below).

In this signature we have:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A \cdot A} = (A^0)^2 - (A^1)^2 - (A^2)^2 - (A^3)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

With the signature (+−−−), four-vectors may be classified as either [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|spacelike]] if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|timelike]] if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|null vector]]s if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=====Standard basis, (−+++) signature=====

Some authors define ''η'' with the opposite sign, in which case we have the (−+++) metric signature. Evaluating the summation with this signature:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot B} = - A^0 B^0 + A^1 B^1 + A^2 B^2 + A^3 B^3 &lt;/math&gt;

while the matrix form is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot B} = \left( \begin{matrix}A^0 &amp; A^1 &amp; A^2 &amp; A^3 \end{matrix} \right) 
\left( \begin{matrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}B^0 \\ B^1 \\ B^2 \\ B^3 \end{matrix} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in this case, in one frame:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{B} = - A^0 B^0 + A^1 B^1 + A^2 B^2 + A^3 B^3 = -C &lt;/math&gt;

while in another:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}'\cdot\mathbf{B}' = - {A'}^0 {B'}^0 + {A'}^1 {B'}^1 + {A'}^2 {B'}^2 + {A'}^3 {B'}^3 = -C'&lt;/math&gt;

so that:

:&lt;math&gt; -C = - A^0 B^0 + A^1 B^1 + A^2 B^2 + A^3 B^3 = - {A'}^0 {B'}^0 + {A'}^1 {B'}^1 + {A'}^2 {B'}^2 + {A'}^3{B'}^3&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to the above expression for ''C'' in terms of '''A''' and '''B'''. Either convention will work. With the Minkowski metric defined in the two ways above, the only difference between covariant and contravariant four-vector components are signs, therefore the signs depend on which sign convention is used.

We have:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A \cdot A} = - (A^0)^2 + (A^1)^2 + (A^2)^2 + (A^3)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

With the signature (−+++), four-vectors may be classified as either [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|spacelike]] if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|timelike]] if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|null]] if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot A} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=====Dual vectors=====

Applying the Minkowski tensor is often expressed as the effect of the [[dual space#Ailinear products and dual spaces|dual vector]] of one vector on the other:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A \cdot B} = A^*(\mathbf{B}) = A{_\nu}B^{\nu}. &lt;/math&gt;

Here the ''A&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''s are the components of the dual vector '''A'''* of '''A''' in the [[dual basis]] and called the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] coordinates of '''A''', while the original ''A&lt;sup&gt;ν&lt;/sup&gt;'' components are called the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] coordinates.

== Four-vector calculus ==

===Derivatives and differentials===

In special relativity (but not general relativity), the [[derivative]] of a four-vector with respect to a scalar ''λ'' (invariant) is itself a four-vector. It is also useful to take the [[differential of a function|differential]] of the four-vector, ''d'''''A''' and divide it by the differential of the scalar, ''dλ'':

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{\text{differential}}{d\mathbf{A}} = \underset{\text{derivative}}{\frac{d\mathbf{A}}{d\lambda}} \underset{\text{differential}}{d\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;

where the contravariant components are:

:&lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{A} = (dA^0, dA^1, dA^2, dA^3) &lt;/math&gt;

while the covariant components are:

:&lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{A} = (dA_0, dA_1, dA_2, dA_3) &lt;/math&gt;

In relativistic mechanics, one often takes the differential of a four-vector and divides by the differential in [[proper time]] (see below).

==Fundamental four-vectors==

===Four-position===

A point in [[Minkowski space]] is a time and spatial position, called an "event", or sometimes the position four-vector or four-position or 4-position, described in some reference frame by a set of four coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}= \left(ct, \mathbf{r}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''r''' is the [[three-dimensional space]] [[position vector]]. If '''r''' is a function of coordinate time ''t'' in the same frame, i.e. '''r''' = '''r'''(''t''), this corresponds to a sequence of events as ''t'' varies. The definition ''R''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ct'' ensures that all the coordinates have the same units (of distance).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Bernard Zuber &amp; Claude Itzykson, ''Quantum Field Theory'', pg 5 , {{ISBN|0-07-032071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles W. Misner]], [[Kip S. Thorne]] &amp; [[John A. Wheeler]],''Gravitation'', pg 51, {{ISBN|0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sterman]], ''An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory'', pg 4 , {{ISBN|0-521-31132-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These coordinates are the components of the ''position four-vector'' for the event.
The ''displacement four-vector'' is defined to be an "arrow" linking two events:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \mathbf{R} = \left(c\Delta t, \Delta \mathbf{r} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

For the [[differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] four-position on a world line we have, using [[Minkowski space#Minkowski tensor|a norm notation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\|d\mathbf{R}\|^2 = \mathbf{dR \cdot dR} = dR^\mu dR_\mu=c^2d\tau^2=ds^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

defining the differential [[line element]] d''s'' and differential proper time increment d''τ'', but this "norm" is also:

:&lt;math&gt;\|d\mathbf{R}\|^2 = (cdt)^2 - d\mathbf{r}\cdot d\mathbf{r} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

so that:

:&lt;math&gt; (c d\tau)^2 = (cdt)^2 - d\mathbf{r}\cdot d\mathbf{r} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

When considering physical phenomena, differential equations arise naturally; however, when considering space and [[time derivative]]s of functions, it is unclear which reference frame these derivatives are taken with respect to. It is agreed that time derivatives are taken with respect to the [[proper time]] &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. As proper time is an invariant, this guarantees that the proper-time-derivative of any four-vector is itself a four-vector. It is then important to find a relation between this proper-time-derivative and another time derivative (using the [[coordinate time]] ''t'' of an inertial reference frame). This relation is provided by taking the above differential invariant spacetime interval, then dividing by (''cdt'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to obtain:

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{cd\tau}{cdt}\right)^2 = 1 - \left(\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{cdt}\cdot \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{cdt}\right) = 1 - \frac{\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{u}}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma(\mathbf{u})^2} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' = ''d'''''r'''/''dt'' is the coordinate 3-[[velocity]] of an object measured in the same frame as the coordinates ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and [[coordinate time]] ''t'', and

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma(\mathbf{u}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1- \frac{\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{u}}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Lorentz factor]]. This provides a useful relation between the differentials in coordinate time and proper time:

:&lt;math&gt; dt = \gamma(\mathbf{u})d\tau \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This relation can also be found from the time transformation in the [[Lorentz transformation]]s.

Important four-vectors in relativity theory can be defined by applying this differential &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\tau}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Four-gradient===

Considering that [[partial derivative]]s are [[linear operator]]s, one can form a [[four-gradient]] from the partial [[time derivative]] {{math|∂}}/{{math|∂}}''t'' and the spatial [[gradient]] ∇. Using the standard basis, in index and abbreviated notations, the contravariant components are:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\boldsymbol{\partial} &amp; = \left(\frac{\partial }{\partial x_0}, \, -\frac{\partial }{\partial x_1}, \, -\frac{\partial }{\partial x_2}, \, -\frac{\partial }{\partial x_3} \right) \\
&amp; = (\partial^0, \, - \partial^1, \, - \partial^2, \, - \partial^3) \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}_0\partial^0 - \mathbf{E}_1\partial^1 - \mathbf{E}_2\partial^2 - \mathbf{E}_3\partial^3 \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}_0\partial^0 - \mathbf{E}_i\partial^i \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}_\alpha \partial^\alpha \\
&amp; = \left(\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t} , \, - \nabla \right) \\
&amp; = \left(\frac{\partial_t}{c},- \nabla \right) \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}_0\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t} - \nabla \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note the basis vectors are placed in front of the components, to prevent confusion between taking the derivative of the basis vector, or simply indicating the partial derivative is a component of this four-vector. The covariant components are:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\partial} &amp; = \left(\frac{\partial }{\partial x^0}, \, \frac{\partial }{\partial x^1}, \, \frac{\partial }{\partial x^2}, \, \frac{\partial }{\partial x^3} \right) \\
&amp; = (\partial_0, \, \partial_1, \, \partial_2, \, \partial_3) \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}^0\partial_0 + \mathbf{E}^1\partial_1 + \mathbf{E}^2\partial_2 + \mathbf{E}^3\partial_3 \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}^0\partial_0 + \mathbf{E}^i\partial_i \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}^\alpha \partial_\alpha \\
&amp; = \left(\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t} , \, \nabla \right) \\
&amp; = \left(\frac{\partial_t}{c}, \nabla \right) \\
&amp; = \mathbf{E}^0\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \nabla \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is an operator, it doesn't have a "length", but evaluating the inner product of the operator with itself gives another operator:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^\mu \partial_\mu = \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 = \frac{{\partial_t}^2}{c^2} - \nabla^2&lt;/math&gt;

called the [[D'Alembert operator]].

==Kinematics==

=== Four-velocity ===

The [[four-velocity]] of a particle is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = \frac{d\mathbf{X}}{d \tau}= \frac{d\mathbf{X}}{dt}\frac{dt}{d \tau} = \gamma(\mathbf{u})\left(c, \mathbf{u} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

Geometrically, '''U''' is a normalized vector tangent to the [[world line]] of the particle. Using the differential of the four-position, the magnitude of the four-velocity can be obtained:

:&lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{U}\|^2 = U^\mu U_\mu = \frac{dX^\mu }{d\tau} \frac{dX_\mu }{d\tau}= \frac{dX^\mu dX_\mu }{d\tau^2} = c^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

in short, the magnitude of the four-velocity for any object is always a fixed constant:

:&lt;math&gt; \| \mathbf{U} \|^2 = c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

The norm is also:

:&lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{U}\|^2 = {\gamma(\mathbf{u})}^2 \left( c^2 - \mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{u} \right) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

so that:

:&lt;math&gt; c^2 = {\gamma(\mathbf{u})}^2 \left( c^2 - \mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{u} \right) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which reduces to the definition of the [[Lorentz factor]].

=== Four-acceleration ===

The [[four-acceleration]] is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} =\frac{d\mathbf{U} }{d \tau} = \gamma(\mathbf{u}) \left(\frac{d{\gamma}(\mathbf{u})}{dt} c, \frac{d{\gamma}(\mathbf{u})}{dt} \mathbf{u} + \gamma(\mathbf{u}) \mathbf{a} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

where '''a''' = ''d'''''u'''/''dt'' is the coordinate 3-acceleration. Since the magnitude of '''U''' is a constant, the four acceleration is orthogonal to the four velocity, i.e. the Minkowski inner product of the four-acceleration and the four-velocity is zero:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{U} = A^\mu  U_\mu  = \frac{dU^\mu}{d\tau} U_\mu = \frac{1}{2} \, \frac{d}{d\tau} (U^\mu U_\mu) = 0  \,&lt;/math&gt;

which is true for all world lines. The geometric meaning of four-acceleration is the [[curvature vector]] of the world line in Minkowski space.

==Dynamics==

=== Four-momentum ===

For a massive particle of [[rest mass]] (or [[invariant mass]]) ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[four-momentum]] is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = m_0 \mathbf{U} = m_0\gamma(\mathbf{u})(c,  \mathbf{u}) = (E/c, \mathbf{p}) &lt;/math&gt;

where the total energy of the moving particle is:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \gamma(\mathbf{u}) m_0c^2  &lt;/math&gt;

and the total [[relativistic momentum]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \gamma(\mathbf{u}) m_0 \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;

Taking the inner product of the four-momentum with itself:

:&lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{P}\|^2 = P^\mu P_\mu = m_0^2 U^\mu U_\mu = m_0^2 c^2&lt;/math&gt;

and also:

:&lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{P}\|^2 = \frac{E^2}{c^2} - \mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p} &lt;/math&gt;

which leads to the [[energy–momentum relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 = c^2 \mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p} + (m_0c^2)^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This last relation is useful [[relativistic mechanics]], essential in [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] and [[relativistic quantum field theory]], all with applications to [[particle physics]].

=== Four-force ===

The [[four-force]] acting on a particle is defined analogously to the 3-force as the time derivative of 3-momentum in [[Newton's second law]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac {d \mathbf{P}} {d \tau} = \gamma(\mathbf{u})\left(\frac{1}{c}\frac{dE}{dt},\frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}\right) = \gamma(\mathbf{u})(P/c,\mathbf{f}) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the [[power (physics)|power]] transferred to move the particle, and '''f''' is the 3-force acting on the particle. For a particle of constant invariant mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, this is equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = m_0 \mathbf{A} = m_0\gamma(\mathbf{u})\left( \frac{d{\gamma}(\mathbf{u})}{dt} c, \left(\frac{d{\gamma}(\mathbf{u})}{dt} \mathbf{u} + \gamma(\mathbf{u}) \mathbf{a}\right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

An invariant derived from the four-force is:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{U} = F^\mu U_\mu = m_0 A^\mu U_\mu = 0&lt;/math&gt;

from the above result.

==Thermodynamics==

{{see also|Relativistic heat conduction}}

===Four-heat flux===

The four-heat flux vector field, is essentially similar to the 3d [[heat flux]] vector field '''q''', in the local frame of the fluid:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Y. M. |last=Ali |first2=L. C. |last2=Zhang |title=Relativistic heat conduction |journal=Int. J. Heat Mass Trans. |volume=48 |year=2005 |issue=12 |pages= |doi=10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2005.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q} = -k \boldsymbol{\partial} T = - k\left( \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}, \nabla T\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is [[absolute temperature]] and ''k'' is [[thermal conductivity]].

===Four-baryon number flux===

The flux of baryons is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne |publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|pages=558–559|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}= n\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the [[number density]] of [[baryon]]s in the local [[rest frame]] of the baryon fluid (positive values for baryons, negative for [[antiparticle|anti]]baryons), and '''U''' the [[four-velocity]] field (of the fluid) as above.

===Four-entropy===

The four-[[entropy]] vector is defined by:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne |publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|page=567|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}= s\mathbf{S} + \frac{\mathbf{Q}}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the entropy per baryon, and ''T'' the [[absolute temperature]], in the local rest frame of the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne |publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|page=558|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electromagnetism==

Examples of four-vectors in [[electromagnetism]] include the following.

===Four-current===

The electromagnetic [[four-current]] (or more correctly a four-current density)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title=Introduction to Special Relativity
 |edition=2nd
 |first1=Wolfgang
 |last1=Rindler
 |publisher=Oxford Science Publications

 |isbn=0-19-853952-5
 |pages=103–107
 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKUPAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} = \left( \rho c, \mathbf{j} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

formed from the [[current density]] '''j''' and [[charge density]] ''ρ''.

===Four-potential===

The [[electromagnetic four-potential]] (or more correctly a four-EM vector potential) defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \left( \frac{\phi}{c}, \mathbf{a} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

formed from the [[vector potential]] '''a''' and the scalar potential ''ϕ''.

The four-potential is not uniquely determined, because it depends on a choice of [[Coulomb gauge#Coulomb gauge|gauge]].

In the [[wave equation]] for the electromagnetic field:
:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{\partial} \cdot \mathbf{\partial}) \mathbf{A} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; {in vacuum}
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{\partial} \cdot \mathbf{\partial}) \mathbf{A} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; {with a [[four-current]] source and using the [[Lorenz gauge condition]] &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{\partial} \cdot \mathbf{A}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}

==Waves==

===Four-frequency===

A photonic [[plane wave]] can be described by the [[four-frequency]] defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N} = \nu\left(1 , \hat{\mathbf{n}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ν'' is the frequency of the wave and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unit vector]] in the travel direction of the wave. Now:

:&lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{N}\| = N^\mu N_\mu = \nu ^2 \left(1 - \hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}\right) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

so the four-frequency of a photon is always a null vector.

===Four-wavevector===

{{see also|De Broglie relation}}

The quantities reciprocal to time ''t'' and space '''r''' are the [[angular frequency]] ''ω'' and [[wave vector]] '''k''', respectively. They form the components of the four-wavevector or wave four-vector:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{k}} \right) = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \frac{\omega}{v_p}\mathbf{\hat{n}} \right) \,. &lt;/math&gt;

A wave packet of nearly [[monochromatic]] light can be described by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \frac{2\pi}{c}\mathbf{N} = \frac{2\pi}{c} \nu(1,\hat{\mathbf{n}}) = \frac{\omega}{c}\left( 1 , \hat{\mathbf{n}} \right) \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The de Broglie relations then showed that four-wavevector applied to [[matter wave]]s as well as to light waves. :

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \hbar \mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{E}{c},\vec{p}\right) = \hbar \left(\frac{\omega}{c},\vec{k} \right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

yielding &lt;math&gt;E = \hbar \omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = \hbar \vec{k}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''ħ'' is the [[Planck constant]] divided by 2''π''.

The square of the norm is:
:&lt;math&gt;\| \mathbf{K} \|^2 = K^\mu K_\mu = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2 - \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{k}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and by the de Broglie relation:

:&lt;math&gt; \| \mathbf{K} \|^2 = \frac{1}{\hbar^2} \| \mathbf{P} \|^2 = \left(\frac{m_0 c}{\hbar}\right)^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

we have the matter wave analogue of the energy–momentum relation:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2 - \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{k} = \left(\frac{m_0 c}{\hbar}\right)^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that for massless particles, in which case {{nowrap|1=''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2 = \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{k} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

or ||'''k'''|| = ''ω''/''c''. Note this is consistent with the above case; for photons with a 3-wavevector of modulus ''ω''/''c'', in the direction of wave propagation defined by the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Quantum theory==

===Four-probability current===

In [[quantum mechanics]], the four-[[probability current]] or probability four-current is analogous to the [[Four-current|electromagnetic four-current]]:&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir G. Ivancevic, Tijana T. Ivancevic (2008) ''Quantum leap: from Dirac and Feynman, across the universe, to human body and mind''. World Scientific Publishing Company, {{ISBN|978-981-281-927-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qyK95FevVbIC&amp;pg=PA41 p. 41]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = (\rho c, \mathbf{j}) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the [[probability density function]] corresponding to the time component, and '''j''' is the [[probability current]] vector. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, this current is always well defined because the expressions for density and current are positive definite and can admit a probability interpretation. In [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]], it is not always possible to find a current, particularly when interactions are involved.

Replacing the energy by the [[energy operator]] and the momentum by the [[momentum operator]] in the four-momentum, one obtains the [[four-momentum operator]], used in [[relativistic wave equation]]s.

===Four-spin===

The [[four-spin]] of a particle is defined in the rest frame of a particle to be

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = (0,\mathbf{s}) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''s''' is the [[spin (physics)|spin]] pseudovector. In quantum mechanics, not all three components of this vector are simultaneously measurable, only one component is. The timelike component is zero in the particle's rest frame, but not in any other frame. This component can be found from an appropriate Lorentz transformation.

The norm squared is the (negative of the) magnitude squared of the spin, and according to quantum mechanics we have

:&lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{S}\|^2 = - |\mathbf{s}|^2 = -\hbar^2s(s+1)&lt;/math&gt;

This value is observable and quantized, with ''s'' the [[spin quantum number]] (not the magnitude of the spin vector).

==Other formulations==

===Four-vectors in the algebra of physical space===

A four-vector ''A'' can also be defined in using the [[Pauli matrices]] as a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], again in various equivalent notations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages= 1142–1143|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne | title=[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]| publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co| year=1973 | isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = (A^0, \, A^1, \, A^2, \, A^3) \\
&amp; = A^0\boldsymbol{\sigma}_0 + A^1 \boldsymbol{\sigma}_1 + A^2 \boldsymbol{\sigma}_2 + A^3  \boldsymbol{\sigma}_3 \\
&amp; = A^0\boldsymbol{\sigma}_0 + A^i \boldsymbol{\sigma}_i \\
&amp; = A^\alpha\boldsymbol{\sigma}_\alpha\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or explicitly:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
\mathbf{A} &amp; = A^0\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} + A^1 \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} + A^2 \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -i \\ i &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} + A^3  \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix} \\
&amp; = \begin{pmatrix} A^0 + A^3 &amp; A^1 -i A^2 \\ A^1 + i A^2 &amp; A^0 - A^3 \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and in this formulation, the four-vector is represented as a [[Hermitian matrix]] (the [[matrix transpose]] and [[complex conjugate]] of the matrix leaves it unchanged), rather than a real-valued column or row vector. The [[determinant]] of the matrix is the modulus of the four-vector, so the determinant is an invariant:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}  
|\mathbf{A}| &amp; = \begin{vmatrix} A^0 + A^3 &amp; A^1 -i A^2 \\ A^1 + i A^2 &amp; A^0 - A^3 \end{vmatrix} \\
&amp; = (A^0 + A^3)(A^0 - A^3)  - (A^1 -i A^2)(A^1 + i A^2) \\
&amp; = (A^0)^2 - (A^1)^2 - (A^2)^2 - (A^3)^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This idea of using the Pauli matrices as [[basis vector]]s is employed in the [[algebra of physical space]], an example of a [[Clifford algebra]].

===Four-vectors in spacetime algebra===

In [[spacetime algebra]], another example of Clifford algebra, the [[gamma matrices]] can also form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. (They are also called the Dirac matrices, owing to their appearance in the [[Dirac equation]]). There is more than one way to express the gamma matrices, detailed in that main article.

The [[Feynman slash notation]] is a shorthand for a four-vector '''A''' contracted with the gamma matrices:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\!\!\!\!/ = A_\alpha \gamma^\alpha = A_0 \gamma^0 + A_1 \gamma^1 + A_2 \gamma^2 + A_3 \gamma^3 &lt;/math&gt;

The four-momentum contracted with the gamma matrices is an important case in [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] and [[relativistic quantum field theory]]. In the Dirac equation and other [[relativistic wave equation]]s, terms of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}\!\!\!\!/ = P_\alpha \gamma^\alpha = P_0 \gamma^0 + P_1 \gamma^1 + P_2 \gamma^2 + P_3 \gamma^3 = \dfrac{E}{c} \gamma^0 - p_x \gamma^1 - p_y \gamma^2 - p_z \gamma^3 &lt;/math&gt;

appear, in which the energy ''E'' and momentum components {{nowrap|(''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} are replaced by their respective [[operator (physics)|operator]]s.

'''''Freedom of Worship''''' or '''''Freedom to Worship''''' is the second of the ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]'' oil paintings produced by the American artist [[Norman Rockwell]]. The series was based on the goals known as the [[Four Freedoms]] enunciated by the 32nd President of the United States, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], in his [[State of the Union Address]] delivered on January 6, 1941.  Rockwell considered this painting and ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' the most successful of the series. ''Freedom of Worship'' was published on the 27th of February, 1943, issue of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' alongside an essay by philosopher [[Will Durant]].

==Background==
''Freedom of Worship'' is the second of a series of four oil paintings by [[Norman Rockwell]] entitled ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]''. The works were inspired by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[State of the Union Address]] delivered to the [[77th United States Congress]] on January 6, 1941, known as [[Four Freedoms]].&lt;ref name="U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412075512/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|archivedate=April 12, 2008|title=100 Documents That Shaped America:President Franklin Roosevelt's Annual Message (Four Freedoms) to Congress (1941)|accessdate=April 11, 2008|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the [[United States Constitution]] are [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=FSP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203440104574406903628933162|title=Free Speech Personified: Norman Rockwell's inspiring and enduring painting|accessdate=December 31, 2013|date=October 10, 2009|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Cole, Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Four Freedoms' theme was later incorporated into the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' World War II policy statement, the [[Atlantic Charter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VjcHPR2lfcC&amp;pg=PA49|title=2048: Humanity's Agreement to Live Together|author=Boyd, Kirk|isbn=1-4596-2515-3|page=12|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhhecYMgUNsC&amp;pg=PA287|title=The Kravchenko Case: One Man's War on Stalin|author=Kern, Gary|isbn=1-929631-73-1|page=287|publisher=Enigma Books|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became part of the charter of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P"/&gt; The series of paintings ran on four consecutive weeks in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', accompanied by essays from noted writers: ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' (February 20), ''Freedom of Worship'' (February 27), ''[[Freedom from Want (painting)|Freedom from Want]]'' (March 6) and ''[[Freedom from Fear (painting)|Freedom from Fear]]'' (March 13).&lt;ref name=NRFF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countrymanpress.com/titles/NormanRockwellsFourFreedoms.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814161913/http://www.countrymanpress.com/titles/NormanRockwellsFourFreedoms.html|archivedate=August 14, 2007|title=Norman Rockwell's Four Freedoms|accessdate=April 11, 2008|publisher=The Countryman Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the essay accompanying ''Freedom of Worship'', ''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author at the peak of his fame.

The painting shows the profiles of eight heads in a modest space. The various figures represent people of different faiths in a moment of prayer. Particularly, three figures on the bottom row (right to left): a man with [[Kippah|his head covered]] carrying a religious book who is [[American Jews|Jewish]], an older woman who is [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]], and a younger woman with a well-lit face holding [[rosary beads]] who is [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]].&lt;ref name=S209/&gt; In 1966, Rockwell used ''Freedom of Worship'' to show his admiration for [[John F. Kennedy]] in a ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' story illustration entitled ''JFK's Bold Legacy''. The work depicts Kennedy in profile in a composition similar to ''Freedom of Worship'' along with [[Peace Corps]] volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Freedom of Worship original draft.jpg|thumb|The original draft of ''Freedom of Worship'' was set in a barbershop.]]
The original version of the painting was set in a barbershop with patrons of a variety of religions and races all waiting their turn in the barber's chair.&lt;ref name=S207&gt;Solomon, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; His first workup was a {{convert|41|×|33|in|cm|adj=on}} oil on canvas depicting tolerance as "the basis for a democracy's religious diversity". It included a Jew being served by a Protestant barber as a black man and a Roman Catholic priest awaited the barber's services.&lt;ref name=C311&gt;Claridge, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was painting easily recognizable depictions of different religions and races because there was little agreement on what a person of a certain religion should look like.&lt;ref name=HaK100&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as he attempted to clarify the characters' depictions he found himself resorting to offensive overexaggeration, especially of the non-clerical characters. Making a Jewish man appear stereotypically Semitic, making a white customer preppy and relegating the black man to agrarian workman attire bogged down the work without speaking on behalf of the government as it should.&lt;ref name=C311-2&gt;Claridge, pp.&amp;nbsp;311–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell's intended theme was religious tolerance, but he felt the original composition did not successfully make this point.&lt;ref name=S209&gt;Solomon, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1942, ''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs became supportive of Rockwell's Four Freedoms sketches,&lt;ref name=AASfaWP/&gt;&lt;ref name=HaK96&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave Rockwell two months to complete the works.&lt;ref name=S204&gt;Solomon, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; By October, the ''Post'' was worried about Rockwell's progress on the ''Four Freedoms'' and sent their art editor to Arlington to evaluate. At that time Rockwell was working on ''Freedom of Worship'', his second painting in the series.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell spent two months (October and most of November 1942)&lt;ref name=S209/&gt; on this work, that was inspired by the phrase "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience." His [[Arlington, Vermont]], neighbors served as his models: Three months pregnant with her hair upbraided, Rose Hoyt posed as a Catholic with a rosary,&lt;ref name=M128&gt;Meyer, pp. 128–33.&lt;/ref&gt; even though she was actually Protestant of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref name=S209/&gt;&lt;ref name=M128/&gt; Other models were a Mrs. Harrington, Rockwell's carpenter Walter Squires, Squire's wife Clara Squires (at the right-hand edge), Winfield Secoy, and Jim Martin (center).&lt;ref name=M128/&gt; His final version relied on other visual clues, including a rosary and a religious book. The work had dark-skinned black worshipers juxtaposed on the edges. This placement did not rock the boat with ''The Post'' who had not yet featured blacks prominently on its pages. Rockwell said he made these ethnics palatable by "'furtively' painting the face of the black woman at the top; the man at the bottom, with his [[fez (hat)|fez]], was too obviously foreign to offend."&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;  The image is commonly enhanced and often darkened in reproduction because it uses a color combination of soft greys, beiges and browns.  The paint was applied thinly, which allows the weave of the canvas to contribute to the image.&lt;ref name="HaK102"/&gt;

Rockwell has stated that he feels hands are second only to heads in importance to the expression of a story. He stated with regards to ''Freedom of Worship'', "I depended on the hands alone to convey about half of the message I wish to put over."&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell's extensive effort on this work was due to his belief that religion "is an extremely delicate subject. It is so easy to hurt so many people's feelings."&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;

==Critical review==
''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs said of ''Speech'' and ''Worship'', "To me they are great human documents in the form of paint and canvas. A great picture, I think is one which moves and inspires millions of people. The ''Four Freedoms'' did&amp;nbsp;— and do."&lt;ref name="MaM 59"&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Disney]] wrote, "I thought your Four Freedoms were great. I especially loved the Freedom of Worship and the composition and symbolism expressed in it."&lt;ref name="MaM 69"&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell believed that ''Freedom of Worship'' and ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' were his better results in the series.&lt;ref name=HaK102/&gt; [[Laura Claridge]] has written that the inspirational phrase "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience" is a "platitude that suggests the plurality of Rockwell's own thoughts on religion: its likely source was a phrase included in the ''[[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Thirteen Articles of Faith]]'' by [[Joseph Smith]]."&lt;ref name=C312&gt;Claridge, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Rockwell repeatedly asked colleagues about possible sources of the quote and was not told about Smith's writing until after the series was published.&lt;ref name=MaM50/&gt; The expression "according to the dictates of his conscience" (or a similar variation) was used in many United States state constitutions in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhqOopdewZMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Blueprint for Judicial Reform|author1=McGuian, Patrick B. |author2=Rader, Randall R.|isbn=978-0-942522-08-2|pages=301–5|publisher=The Free Congress Research and Education Foundation|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical review of the painting shows that some practitioners of particular faiths are disappointed by the acceptance of all faiths expressed in ''Freedom of Religion''.&lt;ref name=ILTPP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,766759,00.html|title=I Like To Please People|accessdate=April 7, 2008|date=June 21, 1943|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claridge feels that &lt;blockquote&gt;the tight amalgam of faces&amp;nbsp;... and even the crepey skin on elderly hands, which have become the objects of worship, push the theme over the edge from idealistic tolerance into gooey sentiment, where human differences seem caught up in a magical moment of dispensation from the Light. The restraint demanded by art that deals with heightened emotion is lacking.&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Claridge stated that the earlier version was "clean, impressively sparse, in counterpoise to a dense narrative content. Beautifully painted even at the preliminary oil sketch stage."&lt;ref name=C312&gt;Claridge, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray and McCabe note that the work is a divergence from the "storytelling style" that Rockwell is known for.&lt;ref name=MaM50&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Solomon]] considers the painting the least satisfactory of the series as she feels it is congested and somewhat "didactic".&lt;ref name=S209/&gt;  Maureen Hart Hennessey, chief curator of the [[Norman Rockwell Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/bio_1706.html|title=Maureen Hart Hennessey|accessdate=June 29, 2014|publisher=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and curator Anne Knutson consider the scale of the picture that only shows heads and hands in prayer as disruptive.&lt;ref name=HaK100/&gt; Bruce Cole of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' noted that Rockwell's "depiction of spectral close-up faces and hands raised in prayer is bland, without any real message about religious freedom—again, no wallop. This is because faith, like the absence of fear and the absence of want, is essentially private, something personal, intangible and unpicturable."&lt;ref name="FSP"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21520">{{About|the philosophical concept described by Nietzsche}}
"'''God is Dead'''" ([[German language|German]]: {{Audio|De-Gott ist tot.ogg|{{lang|de|„Gott ist tot“|nocat=y}}}}; also known as '''the Death of God''') is a widely quoted statement by [[Germany|German]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Nietzsche used the phrase in a figurative sense, to express the idea that [[the Enlightenment]] had "killed" the possibility of belief in [[God]] or any [[gods]] having ever existed. Others, such as proponents of the strongest form of the [[Death of God theology]] have used the phrase in a literal sense, meaning that the Christian God who existed at one point, has ceased to exist. 

The phrase first appeared in Nietzsche's 1882 collection ''[[The Gay Science]]'' ({{lang|de|Die fröhliche Wissenschaft}}, also translated as "The Joyful Pursuit of Knowledge and Understanding").&lt;ref name="gayScience"&gt;in sections 108 (New Struggles), 125 (The Madman), and for a third time in section 343 (The Meaning of our Cheerfulness).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is most famously associated with Nietzsche's ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' ({{lang|de|Also sprach Zarathustra}}), which is most responsible for making the phrase popular.  Other philosophers had previously discussed the concept, 
including [[Philipp Mainländer]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

==Discussion by Hegel==
Discourses of a "death of God" in German culture appear as early as the 17th century and originally referred to [[Lutheran]] theories of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. The phrase "God is dead" appears in the hymn "Ein Trauriger Grabgesang" ("A mournful dirge) by [[Johann von Rist]]. Contemporary historians believe that 19th-century [[German idealism|German idealist]] philosophers, especially those associated with [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], are responsible for removing the specifically Christian resonance of the phrase and associating it with secular philosophical and sociological theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 67-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the statement and its meaning are attributed to Nietzsche, Hegel had discussed the concept of the death of God, in his ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' where he considers the death of God to "Not be seen as anything but an easily recognized part of the usual Christian cycle of redemption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Eric |last1=von der Luft |title=Sources of Nietzsche's "God is Dead!" and its Meaning for Heidegger |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |date=Apr–Jun 1984 |issue=2 |pages=263–276}} See page 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on Hegel writes about the great pain of knowing that God is dead "The pure concept, however, or infinity, as the abyss of nothingness in which all being sinks, must characterize the infinite pain, which previously was only in culture historically and as the feeling on which rests modern religion, the feeling that God Himself is dead, (the feeling which was uttered by Pascal, though only empirically, in his saying: Nature is such that it marks everywhere, both in and outside of man, a lost God), purely as a phase, but also as no more than just a phase, of the highest idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hegel |first1=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich |title=Philosophische Abhandlungen |date=1845 |page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's student [[Richard Rothe]], in his 1837 theological text ''Die Anfänge der christlichen Kirche und ihrer Verfassung'', appears to be one of the first philosophers to associate the idea of a death of God with the sociological theory of [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), pp. 75–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the philosophy of Philipp Mainländer==
Before Nietzsche, the concept was popularized in philosophy by the German philosopher [[Philipp Mainländer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weltschmerz, Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900.|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=0198768710|location=Oxford|pages=202|quote=Batz introduces a very modern and redolent theme: the death of God. He popularized the theme before Nietzsche.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was while reading Mainländer, that Nietzsche explicitly writes to have parted ways with [[Schopenhauer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nietzsche's Philosophical Context: An Intellectual Biography|last=Brobjer|first=Thomas H.|publisher=University Of Illinois Press|year=2008|isbn=9780252032455|location=|pages=149|quote=Decher emphasizes the importance of the fact that Mainländer reinterpreted Schopenhauer's metaphysical and single will to a multiplicity of wills (always in struggle) and the importance of this for Nietzsche's will to power. It was in a letter to Cosima Wagner, december 19, 1876, that is, while reading Mainländer, that Nietzsche for the first time explicitly claimed to have parted ways with Schopenhauer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mainländer’s more than 200 pages long criticism of Schopenhauer’s metaphysics, he argues against one cosmic unity behind the world, and champions a real multiplicity of wills struggling with each other for existence. Yet, the interconnection and the unitary movement of the world, which are the reasons that lead philosophers to [[pantheism]], are undeniable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophie der Erlösung.

It is therefore declared to be dead.

}}"&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Mainländer: '' Die Philosophie der Erlösung. Erster Band.'' Berlin 1876.
&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}|Mainländer, ''Die Philosophie der Erlösung''}}

==Nietzsche's formulation==
The idea is stated in "The Madman" as follows:

{{quotation|God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?|Nietzsche, ''The Gay Science'', Section 125|tr. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]&lt;ref name="gayScience"/&gt;}}

But the best known passage is at the end of part 2 of ''Zarathustra's Prolog'', where after beginning his allegorical journey Zarathustra encounters an aged ascetic who expresses [[misanthropy]] and love of God:

{{quotation|
When Zarathustra heard these words, he saluted the saint and said "What should I have to give you! But let me go quickly that I take nothing from you!" And thus they parted from one another, the old man and Zarathustra, laughing as two boys laugh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But when Zarathustra was alone, he spoke thus to his heart: "Could it be possible! This old saint has not heard in his forest that ''God is dead''!"|Nietzsche, "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" |tr. [[R.J. Hollingdale]]&lt;ref&gt;Penguin Classics Edition 1969 reprint p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|Als Zarathustra aber allein war, sprach er also zu seinem Herzen: "Sollte es denn möglich sein! Dieser alte Heilige hat in seinem Walde noch nichts gehört, daß '''Gott tot ist!'''.}} Reclam edition 1969 p 5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Explanation==

Nietzsche used the phrase to sum up the effect and consequence that the [[Age of Enlightenment]] had had on the centrality of the concept of God within [[Western culture|Western European civilization]], which had been essentially [[Christian]] in character since the later Roman Empire. The Enlightenment had brought about the triumph of scientific rationality over sacred revelation; the rise of [[philosophical materialism]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] that to all intents and purposes had dispensed with the belief in or role of God in human affairs and the destiny of the world.

Nietzsche recognized the crisis that this "Death of God" represented for existing moral assumptions in Europe as they existed within the context of traditional Christian belief. "When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to [[Christian morality]] out from under one's feet. This [[morality]] is by no means self-evident... By breaking one main concept out of [[Christianity]], the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one's hands."&lt;ref&gt;trans. Walter Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale; ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', Expeditions of an Untimely Man, sect. 5&lt;/ref&gt; This is why in "The Madman", a passage which primarily addresses [[nontheists]] (especially atheists), the problem is to retain any system of [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] in the absence of a divine order.

The Enlightenment's conclusion of the "Death of God" gave rise to the proposition that humans - and [[Western Civilization]] as a whole - could no longer believe in a divinely ordained moral order. This death of God will lead, Nietzsche said, not only to the rejection of a belief of cosmic or physical order but also to a rejection of absolute values themselves — to the rejection of belief in an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[morality|moral law]], binding upon all individuals. In this manner, the loss of an absolute basis for morality leads to [[nihilism]]. This nihilism is that for which Nietzsche worked to find a solution by re-evaluating the foundations of human values.

Nietzsche believed that the majority of people did not recognize this death out of the deepest-seated fear or [[angst]]. Therefore, when the death did begin to become widely acknowledged, people would despair and nihilism would become rampant.

===Nietzsche and Heidegger===

[[Martin Heidegger]] understood this part of Nietzsche's philosophy by looking at it as death of [[metaphysics]]. In his view, Nietzsche's words can only be understood as referring not to a particular [[theology|theological]] or [[anthropology|anthropological]] view but rather to the end of philosophy itself. Philosophy has, in Heidegger's words, reached its maximum potential as metaphysics and Nietzsche's words warn of its demise and that of any metaphysical world view. If metaphysics is dead, Heidegger warns, that is because from its inception that was its [[wiktionary:fate|fate]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgan Muller-Lauter, {{lang|de|Heidegger und Nietzsche: Nietzsche-Interpretationen III}}, Walter de Gruyter 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nietzsche and others===
[[Paul Tillich]] as well as [[Richard Schacht]] were influenced by the writings of Nietzsche and especially of his phrase "God is dead."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj3AntBLBQY ''Richard Schacht, After the Death of God: Friedrich Nietzsche and Paul Tillich''] You Tube&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Hamilton (theologian)|William Hamilton]] wrote the following about Nietzsche's view: {{Quotation|For the most part Altizer prefers mystical to ethical language in solving the problem of the death of God, or, as he puts it, in mapping out the way from the profane to the sacred. This combination of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] and [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] makes rather rough reading, but his position at the end is a relatively simple one. Here is an important summary statement of his views: If theology must now accept a dialectical vocation, it must learn the full meaning of Yes-saying and No-saying; it must sense the possibility of a Yes which can become a No, and of a No which can become a Yes; in short, it must look forward to a [[dialectical]] {{lang|la|coincidentia oppositorum}}. Let theology rejoice that faith is once again a "scandal," and not simply a moral scandal, an offense to man’s pride and righteousness, but, far more deeply, an ontological scandal; for eschatological faith is directed against the deepest reality of what we know as history and the cosmos. Through Nietzsche’s vision of Eternal Recurrence we can sense the ecstatic liberation that can be occasioned by the collapse of the transcendence of Being, by the death of God ... and, from Nietzsche’s portrait of Jesus, theology must learn of the power of an eschatological faith that can liberate the believer from what to the contemporary sensibility is the inescapable reality of history. But liberation must finally be effected by affirmation. ... ( See "Theology and the Death of God," in this volume, pp. 95-111.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=537&amp;C=587 ''The Death of God Theologies Today by William Hamilton''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201041352/http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=537&amp;C=587 |date=2015-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===New possibilities===
Nietzsche believed there could be positive possibilities for humans without God. Relinquishing the belief in God opens the way for human creative abilities to fully develop. The Christian God, he wrote, would no longer stand in the way, so human beings might stop turning their eyes toward a [[supernatural]] realm and begin to acknowledge the value of this world.

Nietzsche uses the [[metaphor]] of an open sea, which can be both exhilarating and terrifying. The people who eventually learn to create their lives anew will represent a new stage in human existence, the {{lang|de|[[Übermensch]]}} — i.e. the personal [[archetype]] who, through the conquest of their own nihilism, themselves become a sort of mythical [[hero]]. The "death of God" is the motivation for Nietzsche's last (uncompleted) philosophical project, the "revaluation of all values".

===Nietzsche's voice===
Although Nietzsche puts the statement "God is Dead" into the mouth of a "madman"&lt;ref&gt;Read the whole section here from Thomas Common's translation [https://archive.org/stream/completenietasch10nietuoft#page/166/mode/2up ''The Madman''] Section 125&lt;/ref&gt; in ''The Gay Science'', he also uses the phrase in his own voice in sections 108 and 343 of the same book. In the madman's passage, the man is described as running through a marketplace shouting, "I seek God! I seek God!" He arouses some amusement; no one takes him seriously. Maybe he took an ocean voyage? Lost his way like a little child? Maybe he's afraid of us (non-believers) and is hiding? — much laughter. Frustrated, the madman smashes his lantern on the ground, crying out that "God is dead, and we have killed him, you and I!" "But I have come too soon," he immediately realizes, as his detractors of a minute before stare in astonishment: people cannot yet see that they have killed God. He goes on to say:

{{quote|This prodigious event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time, the light of the stars requires time, deeds, though done, still require time to be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than the most distant stars — and yet they have done it themselves.|trans. Walter Kaufmann|''The Gay Science'', sect. 125}}

Earlier in the book (section 108), Nietzsche wrote "God is Dead; but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown. And we — we still have to vanquish his shadow, too." The protagonist in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' also speaks the words, commenting to himself after visiting a hermit who, every day, sings songs and lives to glorify his god as noted above.

What is more, Zarathustra later refers not only to the death of God, but states: "Dead are all the Gods". It is not just one morality that has died, but all of them, to be replaced by the life of the {{lang|de|Übermensch}}, the new man:

{{quote|'DEAD ARE ALL THE GODS: NOW DO WE DESIRE THE OVERMAN TO LIVE.'|trans. [[Thomas Common]]|Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Part I, Section XXII,3}}
&lt;!--
Coming across in a hymn of [[Martin Luther]] what [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] described as ''the cruel words'', ''the harsh utterance'', namely, ''God is dead'', the latter was perhaps the first great philosopher to develop the theme of God's death according to whom, to one form of experience, God is dead. Commenting on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s first ''Critique'', [[Heinrich Heine]] spoke of ''a dying God''. Heine influenced Nietzsche. Since Heine and Nietzsche the phrase ''Death of God'' became popular. (K Satchidananda Murty, ''The Realm of Between'', IIAS,1973)--&gt;

==Death of God theological movement==
{{main|Death of God theology}}
The cover of the April 8, 1966 edition of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and the accompanying article concerned a movement in American theology that arose in the 1960s known as the "death of God". Although theologians since Nietzsche had occasionally used the phrase "God is dead" to reflect increasing [[nontheism|unbelief in God]], the concept rose to prominence in the late 1950s and 1960s, before waning again.&lt;ref&gt;Gundry, S.N. "Death of God Theology" in ''Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'', ed. Walter A. Elwell, Grand Rapids: Baker (2001), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; The main proponents of this [[theology]] included the Christian theologians [[Gabriel Vahanian]], [[Paul van Buren]], [[William Hamilton (theologian)|William Hamilton]], [[John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)|John Robinson]], [[Thomas J. J. Altizer]] and [[John D. Caputo]], and the [[rabbi]] [[Richard L. Rubenstein]].

Many of the basic ideas that animated the [[human rights movement]] developed in the aftermath of the [[Second World War]] and the events of [[the Holocaust]],&lt;ref name=twsGaryJBass/&gt; culminating in the adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in Paris by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1948.

[[File:Cyrus Cylinder front.jpg|thumb|The [[Cyrus Cylinder]], created by king [[Cyrus the Great]], is sometimes argued to be the world's first charter of human rights.]]

The history of human rights has not been entirely progressive. Many established rights would be replaced by other less tolerant systems. Stable institutions may be uprooted such as in cases of conflict such as war and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights: Commitment and Betrayal. Author, M. G. Chitkara. Publisher, APH Publishing, 1996. ISBN, 8170247276, 9788170247272.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest conceptualisation of human rights is credited to ideas about [[natural rights]] emanating from [[natural law]].

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'' approved by the [[National Assembly of France]], 26 August 1789]]

17th-century English philosopher [[John Locke]] discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being "life, liberty, and estate (property)", and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the [[social contract]]. In Britain in 1689, the English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and the Scottish [[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]] each made illegal a range of oppressive governmental actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|publisher=British Library|accessdate=27 November 2015|quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown ... providing for the regular meeting of Parliament, free elections to the Commons, free speech in parliamentary debates, and some basic human rights, most famously freedom from ‘cruel or unusual punishment’.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century, in the United States (1776) and in France (1789), leading to the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] respectively, both of which articulated certain human rights. Additionally, the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] of 1776 encoded into law a number of fundamental [[civil rights]] and civil freedoms.

{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.|United States Declaration of Independence, 1776}}

These were followed by developments in philosophy of human rights by philosophers such as [[Thomas Paine]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. The term ''human rights'' probably came into use some time between Paine's ''The Rights of Man'' and [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s 1831 writings in ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', in which he stated that he was trying to enlist his readers in "the great cause of human rights". Although the term had been used by at least one author as early as 1742.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

=== 19th century ===

In the 19th century, human rights became a central concern over the issue of [[slavery]].&lt;ref name=twsGaryJBass/&gt; A number of reformers, notably British Member of Parliament [[William Wilberforce]], worked towards the abolition of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. This was achieved across the [[British Empire]] by the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], which was [[Blockade of Africa|enforced internationally]] by the Royal Navy under treaties Britain negotiated with other nations,&lt;ref name="Lovejoy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lovejoy |first=Paul E. |title=Transformations in slavery: a history of slavery in Africa |page=290 |location=New York |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0521780124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. In the United States, all the northern states had [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolished]] the institution of slavery between 1777 and 1804, although southern states clung tightly to the "peculiar institution". Conflict and debates over the expansion of slavery to new territories constituted one of the reasons for the southern states' [[secession]] and the [[American Civil War]]. During the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction period]] immediately following the war, several amendments to the [[United States Constitution]] were made. These included the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th amendment]], banning slavery, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]], assuring full citizenship and civil rights to all people born in the United States, and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th amendment]], guaranteeing [[African Americans]] the right to vote. In [[Russia]], the reformer [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]] ended serfdom in 1861,&lt;ref name=twsGaryJBass/&gt; although the freed serfs often faced restrictions of their mobility within the nation.

Many groups and movements have achieved profound social changes over the course of the 20th century in the name of human rights. In [[Europe]] and North America, [[trade union|labour unions]] brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating [[child labor|child labour]]. The [[women's rights]] movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to [[voting|vote]]. [[Wars of national liberation|National liberation movements]] in many countries succeeded in driving out [[colony|colonial]] powers. One of the most influential was [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s movement to free his native India from British rule. Movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the [[civil rights movement]], and more recent movements, on behalf of women and minorities in the United States.

The establishment of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], the 1864 [[Lieber Code]] and the first of the [[Geneva Conventions]] in 1864 laid the foundations of [[International humanitarian law]], to be further developed following the two [[World Wars]].

=== 20th century ===

The World Wars, and the huge losses of life and gross abuses of human rights that took place during them, were a driving force behind the development of modern [[international human rights instruments|human rights instruments]]. The [[League of Nations]] was established in 1919 at the negotiations over the [[Treaty of Versailles]] following the end of [[World War I]]. The League's goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation and diplomacy, and improving global welfare. Enshrined in its charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

At the 1945 [[Yalta Conference]], the Allied Powers agreed to create a new body to supplant the League's role; this was to be the [[United Nations]]. The United Nations has played an important role in international human-rights law since its creation. Following the World Wars, the United Nations and its members developed much of the discourse and the bodies of law that now make up [[international humanitarian law]] and [[international human rights law]]. Analyst Belinda Cooper argued that human rights organisations flourished in the 1990s, possibly as a result of the dissolution of the [[Western bloc|western]] and [[Eastern bloc|eastern]] Cold War blocs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/books/review/Cooper-t.html|title=Book Review - The Last Utopia - Human Rights in History - By Samuel Moyn|first=Belinda|last=Cooper|date=September 24, 2010|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig Hoffmann argues that human rights became more widely emphasised in the latter half of the twentieth century because it "provided a language for political claim making and counter-claims, liberal-democratic, but also socialist and post colonialist.&lt;ref name="Hoffmann2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefan-Ludwig Hoffmann|title=Human Rights in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ES8ptQvfVvAC&amp;pg=PA2|date=December 13, 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49410-6|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam
{{Main|Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam}}
The CDHR was signed by member states of the OIC in 1990 at the 19th Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Cairo, Egypt. It was seen as the answer to the UDHR. In fact, the CDHR was "patterned after the UN-sponsored UDHR of 1948".&lt;ref name="Ahsan, Abdullah 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=al-Ahsan |first1=Abdullah |title=Law, Religion and Human Dignity in the Muslim World Today: An Examination of OIC's Cairo Declaration of Human Rights |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |date=2008 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=569–597 |doi=10.1017/S0748081400001715 |url=http://irep.iium.edu.my/7070 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |language=en |issn=0748-0814 |hdl=hein.journals/jlrel24 |jstor=25654330}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the CDHR was to "serve as a guide for member states on human rights issues. CDHR translated the Qur'anic teachings as follows: "All men are equal in terms of basic human dignity and basic obligations and responsibilities, without any discrimination on the basis of race, colour, language, belief, sex, religion, political affiliation, social status or other considerations. True religion is the guarantee for enhancing such dignity along the path to human integrity.&lt;ref name="Ahsan, Abdullah 2009"/&gt; The CDHR referenced Islamic [[Sharia]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/cairodeclaration.html|title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|website=hrlibrary.umn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes [[Quran]], [[Hadith]], prophetic teachings and Islamic legal tradition.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Philosophy of human rights}}
The philosophy of human rights attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of human rights and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why human rights have become a part of social expectations.

One of the oldest Western philosophies of human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behaviour which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with [[David Hume|Hume]]). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of [[Max Weber|Weber]]). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) – a social contract. The two theories that dominate contemporary human rights discussion are the interest theory and the will theory. Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom.&lt;ref name="IEOP"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Fagan |2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other positions attempt to categorise rights into basic types, rather than make claims about the function or derivation of particular rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Woody |title=Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds |journal=Teknokultura |date=12 August 2015 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=373–384 |doi=10.5209/rev_TK.2015.v12.n2.49072 |url=https://philarchive.org/archive/EVAPRDv1 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |language=en |format=PDF |issn=1549-2230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The claims made by human rights to universality have led to criticism. Philosophers who have criticised the concept of human rights include [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Karl Marx]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Canadian political philosophy professor Charles Blattberg argues that discussion of human rights, being abstract, demotivates people from upholding the values that rights are meant to affirm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last= Blattberg  |first= C  |year= 2010  |publisher= [[McGill-Queen's University Press]]  |chapter= The Ironic Tragedy of Human Rights  |isbn= 978-0-7735-3538-1  |title= Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy |pages=  43–59  |authorlink= Charles Blattberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TwCsA–l408C&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] gives particular attention to two types of criticisms: the one questioning universality of human rights and the one denying them objective ground.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Fagan]] [http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#H5 Philosophical criticisms of human rights] [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] Human Rights 2003-2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Pellet]], a French scholar on international law, criticises "human rightism" approach as denying the principle of sovereignty and claiming a special place for human rights among the branches of international law;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain Pellet]] [http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article27 "Droits-de-l’hommisme" et droit international] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117073042/http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article27 |date=January 17, 2013 }} 2000 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; French journalist [[Alain de Benoist]] questions human rights premises of human equality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain de Benoist]] [http://www.alaindebenoist.com/pdf/au-dela_des_droits_de_l_homme.pdf Au-dela des droits de l'homme]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317161306/http://www.alaindebenoist.com/pdf/au-dela_des_droits_de_l_homme.pdf |date=March 17, 2012 }} Krisis 2004{{fr icon}}; Religion of Human Rights, 1988 [http://www.velesova-sloboda.org/misc/benoist-die-religion-der-menschenrechte.html {{de icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505173723/http://velesova-sloboda.org/misc/benoist-die-religion-der-menschenrechte.html |date=May 5, 2012 }} [http://www.velesova-sloboda.org/polit/benoist-religiya-prav-cheloveka.html {{ru icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505201210/http://velesova-sloboda.org/polit/benoist-religiya-prav-cheloveka.html |date=May 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American scholar [[David Kennedy (jurist)|David Kennedy]] had listed pragmatic worries and polemical charges concerning human rights in 2002 in ''Harvard Human Rights Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=KENNEDY |first1=David|authorlink1=David Kennedy (jurist) |title=The International Human Rights Movements: Part of the Problem?’ |journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal |date= Spring 2002 |volume=15 |pages=101 |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss15/kennedy.shtml#fn1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Human rights can be classified and organised in several different ways. At an international level the most common categorisation of human rights has been to split them into [[civil and political rights]], and [[economic, social and cultural rights]].

Civil and political rights are enshrined in articles 3 to 21 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ([[ICCPR]]). Economic, social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles 22 to 28 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ([[ICESCR]]).

===Indivisibility===
The [[UDHR]] included both economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination:

{{Quote|The ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights, as well as his social, economic and cultural rights.|International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, 1966}}

This is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights. Similarly, without livelihoods and a working society, the public cannot assert or make use of civil or political rights (known as the ''full belly thesis'').

The indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights has been confirmed by the 1993 [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]]:

{{Quote|All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and related. The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis.|[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], [[World Conference on Human Rights]], 1993}}
This statement was again endorsed at the 2005 World Summit in New York (paragraph 121).

Although accepted by the signatories to the [[UDHR]], most do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights. Some Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the [[right to work]], to [[right to education|education]], [[right to health|health]] and housing. Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights.

===Categorisation===
Opponents of the indivisibility of human rights argue that economic, social and cultural rights are fundamentally different from civil and political rights and require completely different approaches.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Economic, social and cultural rights are argued{{By whom|date=July 2014}} to be:
* ''aspirations or goals'', as opposed to real 'legal' rights
* ''ideologically divisive/political'', meaning that there is no consensus on what should or should not be provided as a right
* ''non-justiciable'', meaning that their provision, or the breach of them, cannot be judged in a court of law
* ''positive'', meaning that they require active provision of entitlements by the state (as opposed to the state being required only to prevent the breach of rights)
* ''progressive'', meaning that they will take significant time to implement
* ''resource-intensive'', meaning that they are expensive and difficult to provide
* ''[[socialism|socialist]]'', as opposed to [[capitalism|capitalist]]
* ''vague'', meaning they cannot be quantitatively measured, and whether they are adequately provided or not is difficult to judge.
Similarly civil and political rights are categorized as:
* ''capitalist''
* ''cost-free''
* ''immediate'', meaning they can be immediately provided if the state decides to
* ''justiciable''
* ''negative'', meaning the state can protect them simply by taking no action
* ''non-ideological/non-political''
* ''precise'', meaning their provision is easy to judge and measure
* ''real 'legal' rights''

Australian politician Olivia Ball and British scholar Paul Gready argue that for both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, it is easy to find examples which do not fit into the above categorisation. Among several others, they highlight the fact that maintaining a judicial system, a fundamental requirement of the civil right to due process before the law and other rights relating to judicial process, is positive, resource-intensive, progressive and vague, while the social right to housing is precise, justiciable and can be a real 'legal' right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three generations===
Another categorisation, offered by Czech-French scholar [[Karel Vasak]], is that there are ''[[three generations of human rights]]'': first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment). Out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition. This categorisation is at odds with the indivisibility of rights, as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others. Prioritisation of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity. American human rights scholar [[Philip Alston]] argues:

{{quote|If every possible human rights element is deemed to be essential or necessary, then nothing will be treated as though it is truly important.&lt;ref name="Alston807"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Alston |2005 |p=807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He, and others, urge caution with prioritisation of rights:

{{quote|source=|[T]he call for prioritizing is not to suggest that any obvious violations of rights can be ignored.|Philip Alston&lt;ref name="Alston807"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Priorities, where necessary, should adhere to core concepts (such as reasonable attempts at progressive realization) and principles (such as non-discrimination, equality and participation.|Olivia Ball, Paul Gready&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some human rights are said to be "[[inalienable rights]]". The term inalienable rights (or unalienable rights) refers to "a set of human rights that are fundamental, are not awarded by human power, and cannot be surrendered."

==International protection and promotion==
{{Main|International human rights law}}
In the aftermath of the atrocities of World War II, there was increased concern for the social and legal protection of human rights as fundamental freedoms. The foundation of the [[United Nations]] and the provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for a comprehensive system of international law and practice for the protection of human rights. Since then, international human rights law has been characterised by a linked system of conventions, treaties, organisations, and political bodies, rather than any single entity or set of laws.&lt;ref name="Brownlie532"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Brownlie|2003|p=532 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, American analyst [[Pierre N. Leval|Pierre Leval]] suggested that respect for fundamental human rights in the world today (in 2013) is "dismal" within some nations:&lt;ref name=twsForeignAffairs/&gt;

{{Quote|Despotic regimes murder, mutilate, and rape civilian populations and arbitrarily imprison and torture political opponents. Human traffickers, almost invariably operating with the protection of corrupt local officials and police, enslave children and young women in the sex trade. So long as the regimes that sponsor and protect these criminals remain in power, their crimes go unrecognized.|[[Pierre N. Leval]] in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', 2013&lt;ref name=twsForeignAffairs&gt;Pierre N.

===United Nations Charter===
{{Main|United Nations Charter}}
The provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for the development of international human rights protection in the opinion of British barrister [[Ian Brownlie]].&lt;ref name="Brownlie532" /&gt; The preamble of the charter provides that the members "reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the equal rights of men and women" and Article 1(3) of the United Nations charter states that one of the purposes of the UN is: "to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/chapter1.html] United Nations Charter Article 1(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Article 55 provides that:
{{quote|The United Nations shall promote: a) higher standards of living, full employment, and conditions of economic and social progress and development; b) solutions of international economic, social, health, and related problems; c) international cultural and educational cooperation; d) universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.}}
Of particular importance{{According to whom|date=May 2017}} is Article 56 of the charter: "All Members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55." This is a binding treaty provision applicable to both the organization and its members and has been taken to constitute a legal obligation for the members of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="Brownlie532"/&gt; Overall, the references to human rights in the charter are general and vague. The charter does not contain specific legal rights, nor does it mandate any enforcement procedures to protect these rights.&lt;ref name="Shaw277"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=277 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Shaw, the importance of human rights on the global stage can be traced to the importance of human rights within the United Nations framework and the UN Charter can be seen as the starting point for the development of a broad array of declarations, treaties, implementation and enforcement mechanisms, UN organs, committees and reports on the protection of human rights.&lt;ref name="Shaw277"/&gt; The rights espoused in the UN charter were codified and defined in a non-binding context within the International Bill of Human Rights, composing the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
{{Main|Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}

[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] with the Spanish text of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration]] in 1949.]]
The '''Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)''' was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly&lt;ref name="UDHR"/&gt; in 1948, partly in response to the atrocities of [[World War II]]. It is generally viewed as the preeminent statement of international rights and has been identified as being a culmination of centuries of thinking along both secular and religious lines.&lt;ref name=twsIshay&gt;The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalization Era, [[Micheline R.

The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behaviour of states and press upon them duties to their citizens.

{{quote|...recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and [[inalienable rights]] of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.|Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948}}

The UDHR was framed by members of the Human Rights Commission, with former [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as Chair, who began to discuss an ''International Bill of Rights'' in 1947. The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights, and whether, or how, it should be enforced. The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties, but the UDHR quickly became the priority.&lt;ref name=Glendon&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Glendon |2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Canadian law professor [[John Peters Humphrey|John Humphrey]] and French lawyer [[René Cassin]] were responsible for much of the cross-national research and the structure of the document respectively, where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble. The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood in the first two articles, followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals; rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups; spiritual, public and political rights; and economic, social and cultural rights. According to Cassin, the final three articles place rights in the context of limits, duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realised.&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;
Humphrey and Cassin intended the rights in the UDHR to be legally enforceable through some means, as is reflected in the third clause of the preamble:&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;

{{quote|Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.|Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948}}

Some of the UDHR was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights, including representatives from all continents and all major religions, and drawing on consultation with leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;Glendon (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The inclusion of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gready34"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was predicated on the assumption that all human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked. This principle was not then opposed by any member states (the declaration was adopted unanimously, [[Byelorussian SSR]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Union of South Africa]], [[USSR]], [[Yugoslavia]].); however, this principle was later subject to significant challenges.&lt;ref name="Gready34"/&gt;

The Universal Declaration was bifurcated into treaties, a Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and another on social, economic, and cultural rights, due to questions about the relevance and propriety of economic and social provisions in covenants on human rights. Both covenants begin with the right of people to self-determination and to sovereignty over their natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;Henkin, Louis. The International Bill of Rights: The Universal Declaration and the Covenants, in International Enforcement of Human Rights 6–9, Bernhardt and Jolowicz, eds, (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; This debate over whether human rights are more fundamental than economic rights has continued to the present day. The United States declared after the World Food Summit that a right to be free from hunger does not give rise to any international obligations which has been interpreted as a [[negative duty]].&lt;ref name=ohch&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=Poverty and Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/poverty/expert/docs/Thomas_Pogge_Summary.pdf|website=ohchr.org|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drafters of the Covenants initially intended only one instrument. The original drafts included only political and civil rights, but economic and social rights were also proposed. The disagreement over which rights were basic human rights resulted in there being two covenants. The debate was whether economic and social rights are aspirational, as contrasted with basic human rights which all people possess purely by being human, because economic and social rights depend on wealth and the availability of resources. In addition, which social and economic rights should be recognised depends on ideology or economic theories, in contrast to basic human rights, which are defined purely by the nature (mental and physical abilities) of human beings. It was debated whether economic rights were appropriate subjects for binding obligations and whether the lack of consensus over such rights would dilute the strength of political-civil rights. There was wide agreement and clear recognition that the means required to enforce or induce compliance with socioeconomic undertakings were different from the means required for civil-political rights.&lt;ref&gt;Henkin, Louis. Introduction, The International Bill of Rights 9–10 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Henkin |first1=Louis|title=The International Bill of Rights: The Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |date=1981|publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780231051804|pages=9–10 |edition= |url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/789034 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |language=en |chapter= Introduction|hdl=10822/789034|oclc= 802896468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This debate and the desire for the greatest number of signatories to human-rights law led to the two covenants. The Soviet bloc and a number of developing countries had argued for the inclusion of all rights in a so-called ''Unity Resolution''. Both covenants allowed states to derogate some rights.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Those in favour of a single treaty could not gain sufficient consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |quote= The principal aim of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was to create a framework for a universal code based on mutual consent.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The early years of the United Nations were overshadowed by the division between the democratic and communist conceptions of human rights, although neither side called into question the concept of universality. The debate centered on which "rights" — political, economic, and social — were to be included among the Universal Instruments.

===International treaties===
In 1966, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ('''ICCPR''') and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ('''ICESCR''') were adopted by the [[United Nations]], between them making the rights contained in the UDHR binding on all states that have signed this treaty, creating human-rights law.

Since then numerous other treaties ([[International human rights instruments|pieces of legislation]]) have been offered at the international level. They are generally known as ''human rights instruments''. Some of the most significant, referred to (with ICCPR and ICESCR) as "the seven core treaties", are:
* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] ('''CEDAW''') (adopted 1979, entry into force: 1981)
* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] ('''CERD''') (adopted 1966, entry into force: 1969)
* [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] ('''CRPD''') (adopted 2006, entry into force: 2008)
* [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] ('''CRC''') (adopted 1989, entry into force: 1989)
* [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] ('''CAT''') (adopted 1984, entry into force: 1987)
* [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families]] ('''ICRMW''' or more often '''MWC''') (adopted 1990, entry into force: 2003)

===Customary international law===
{{Main|Customary international law}}
In addition to protection by international treaties, customary international law may protect some human rights, such as the prohibition of torture, genocide and slavery and the principle of non-discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International humanitarian law===
{{Main|Geneva Conventions|International humanitarian law}}

The '''Geneva Conventions''' came into being between 1864 and 1949 as a result of efforts by [[Henry Dunant]], the founder of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]. The conventions safeguard the human rights of individuals involved in armed conflict, and build on the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], the international community's first attempt to formalise the laws of war and war crimes in the nascent body of secular international law. The conventions were revised as a result of World War II and readopted by the international community in 1949.

===United Nations system===
{{Main|United Nations}}
Under the mandate of the UN charter, and the multilateral UN human rights treaties, the United Nations (UN) as an intergovernmental body seeks to apply international [[jurisdiction]] for universal human-rights legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the UN machinery, human-rights issues are primarily the concern of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], and there are numerous committees within the UN with responsibilities for safeguarding different human-rights treaties. The most senior body of the UN in the sphere of human rights is the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The United Nations has an international mandate to:

{{quote|achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, gender, language, or religion.|Article 1–3 of the [[United Nations Charter]]}}

====Political bodies====

=====Security Council=====
{{Main|United Nations Security Council}}
The '''United Nations Security Council''' has the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security and is the only body of the UN that can authorise the use of force. It has been criticised for failing to take action to prevent human rights abuses, including the [[War in Darfur|Darfur crisis]], the [[Srebrenica massacre]] and the [[Rwandan Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;Fred Grünfeld and Anke Huijboom, ''The failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda: the role of bystanders'' (2007) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; For example, critics blamed the presence of non-democracies on the Security Council for its failure regarding.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Feinstein, ''Darfur and beyond: what is needed to prevent mass atrocities'' (2007) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2006 the Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1674|resolution 1674]] that reaffirmed the responsibility to protect populations from [[genocide]], [[war crime]]s, [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]" and committed the Security Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict.&lt;ref name="Oxfam_28April"&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org/en/news/pressreleases2006/pr060428_un Security Council passes landmark resolution – world has responsibility to protect people from genocide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012101425/http://www.oxfam.org/en/news/pressreleases2006/pr060428_un |date=October 12, 2010 }} [[Oxfam]] Press Release - April 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=====General Assembly=====
[[File:UN General Assembly hall.jpg|thumb|The [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]]]]
{{Main|United Nations General Assembly}}
The '''United Nations General Assembly''', under Article 13 of the UN Charter, has the power to initiate studies and make recommendations on human rights issues.&lt;ref name="Sepúlveda et al. 2004 80"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Sepúlveda et al. |2004 |p=80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under this provision, the general assembly passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, and since then a wide variety of other human rights instruments.&lt;ref name="Sepúlveda et al. 2004 80"/&gt; The assembly has several subsidiary organs that deal with specific human rights issues, such as the Special Committee on Decolonisation and the Special Commission against Apartheid (no longer operational). In addition the general assembly has set up a number of subsidiary organs that consider human rights issues in a number of high-profile contexts: such as the UN Council on Namibia, the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practises in the Occupied territories and the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable rights of the Palestine People.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Human Rights Council=====
{{Main|United Nations Human Rights Council}}

The '''United Nations Human Rights Council''', created at the [[2005 World Summit]] to replace the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], has a mandate to investigate violations of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Human Rights Council is a subsidiary body of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reports directly to it. It ranks below the Security Council, which is the final authority for the interpretation of the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;UN Charter, Article 39&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-seven of the one hundred ninety-one member states sit on the council, elected by simple majority in a secret ballot of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. Members serve a maximum of six years and may have their membership suspended for gross human rights abuses. The Council is based in [[Geneva]], and meets three times a year; with additional meetings to respond to urgent situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent experts (''rapporteurs'') are retained by the Council to investigate alleged human rights abuses and to provide the Council with reports.

The Human Rights Council may request that the Security Council take action when human rights violations occur. This action may be direct actions, may involve [[International sanctions|sanctions]], and the Security Council may also refer cases to the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) even if the issue being referred is outside the normal jurisdiction of the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;The Security Council referred the human rights situation in [[Darfur]] in [[Sudan]] to the ICC despite the fact that Sudan has a functioning legal system&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treaty bodies====
{{anchor|Treaty bodies}}&lt;!-- [[Human rights treaty bodies]] redirects here --&gt;
In addition to the political bodies whose mandate flows from the UN charter, the UN has set up a number of ''treaty-based'' bodies, comprising committees of independent experts who monitor compliance with human rights standards and norms flowing from the core international human rights treaties. They are supported by and are created by the treaty that they monitor, With the exception of the CESCR, which was established under a resolution of the Economic and Social Council to carry out the monitoring functions originally assigned to that body under the Covenant, they are technically autonomous bodies, established by the treaties that they monitor and accountable to the state parties of those treaties - rather than subsidiary to the United Nations. Though in practice they are closely intertwined with the United Nations system and are supported by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (UNHCHR) and the UN Centre for Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Human Rights Committee]]'' promotes participation with the standards of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]. The members of the committee express opinions on member countries and make judgments on individual complaints against countries which have ratified an Optional Protocol to the treaty. The judgments, termed "views", are not legally binding. The member of the committee meets around  three times a year to hold sessions &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CCPR/Pages/CCPRIntro.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} Introduction of the Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]'' monitors the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]] and makes general comments on ratifying countries performance. It will have the power to receive complaints against the countries that opted into the Optional Protocol once it has come into force. It is important to note that unlike the other treaty bodies, the economic committee is not an autonomous body responsible to the treaty parties, but directly responsible to the Economic and Social Council and ultimately to the General Assembly. This means that the Economic Committee faces particular difficulties at its disposal only relatively "weak" means of implementation in comparison to other treaty bodies.&lt;ref name=Shaw309&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particular difficulties noted by commentators include: perceived vagueness of the principles of the treaty, relative lack of legal texts and decisions, ambivalence of many states in addressing economic, social and cultural rights, comparatively few non-governmental organisations focused on the area and problems with obtaining relevant and precise information.&lt;ref name=Shaw309/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* The ''Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination'' monitors the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|CERD]] and conducts regular reviews of countries' performance. It can make judgments on complaints against member states allowing it, but these are not legally binding. It issues warnings to attempt to prevent serious contraventions of the convention.
* The ''Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women'' monitors the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]]. It receives states' reports on their performance and comments on them, and can make judgments on complaints against countries which have opted into the 1999 Optional Protocol.
* The ''Committee Against Torture'' monitors the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|CAT]] and receives states' reports on their performance every four years and comments on them. Its subcommittee may visit and inspect countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol.
* The ''[[Committee on the Rights of the Child]]'' monitors the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]] and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years. It does not have the power to receive complaints.
* The ''Committee on Migrant Workers'' was established in 2004 and monitors the [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|ICRMW]] and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years. It will have the power to receive complaints of specific violations only once ten member states allow it.
* The ''[[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]'' was established in 2008 to monitor the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]. It has the power to receive complaints against the countries which have opted into the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].
* The ''Committee on Enforced Disappearances'' monitors the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance|ICPPED]]. All States parties are obliged to submit reports to the Committee on how the rights are being implemented. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of "concluding observations”.

Each treaty body receives secretariat support from the Human Rights Council and Treaties Division of Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) in Geneva except CEDAW, which is supported by the Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW). CEDAW formerly held all its sessions at United Nations headquarters in New York but now frequently meets at the United Nations Office in Geneva; the other treaty bodies meet in Geneva. The Human Rights Committee usually holds its March session in New York City.

===Regional human rights regimes===
{{Main|Regional human rights regimes}}
International human rights regimes are in several cases "nested" within more comprehensive and overlapping regional agreements. These regional regimes can be seen as relatively independently coherent human rights sub-regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Donnelly |2003 |p=138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three principal regional human rights instruments can be identified; the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (the Americas) and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The European Convention on Human Rights has since 1950 defined and guaranteed human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe.&lt;ref name=EUCourt&gt;{{cite web

{{Main|Non-governmental organization}}
International '''non-governmental human rights organisations''' such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[International Service for Human Rights]] and [[International Federation of Human Rights|FIDH]] monitor what they see as human rights issues around the world and promote their views on the subject. Human rights organisations have been said to "translate complex international issues into activities to be undertaken by concerned citizens in their own community".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Human rights organisations frequently engage in [[lobbying]] and [[advocacy]] in an effort to convince the United Nations, supranational bodies and national governments to adopt their policies on human rights. Many human-rights organisations have observer status at the various UN bodies tasked with protecting human rights. A new (in 2009) non-governmental human-rights conference is the [[Oslo Freedom Forum]], a gathering described by [[The Economist]] as "on its way to becoming a human-rights equivalent of the Davos economic forum." The same article noted that human-rights advocates are more and more divided amongst themselves over how violations of human rights are to be defined, notably as regards the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

There is criticism of human-rights organisations who use their status but allegedly move away from their stated goals. For example, [[Gerald M. Steinberg]], an Israel-based academic, maintains that NGOs take advantage of a "[[halo effect]]" and are "given the status of impartial moral watchdogs" by governments and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Human rights defenders===
{{Main|Human rights defender}}
Human rights defender are people who, individually or with others, act peacefully to promote or protect human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ishr.ch/news/un-declaration-human-rights-defenders|title=UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders|work=ISHR|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can defend rights as part of their jobs or in a voluntary capacity and can act at local, national or international level. They can be journalists, environmentalists, whistle-blowers, trade unionists, lawyers, teachers, housing campaigners, and so on. As a result of their activities, they can sometimes be the subject of reprisals and attacks of all kinds, including smears, surveillance, harassment, false charges, arbitrary detention, restrictions on the right to freedom of association, and physical attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act30/6011/2017/en/|title=Human Rights Defenders under threat|last=Amnesty International|first=|date=2017|website=amnesty.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporations===

Although the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed, that surrounding multinational companies is both controversial and ill-defined.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Multinational companies' primary responsibility is to their [[shareholder]]s, not to those affected by their actions. Such companies may be larger than the economies of some of the states within which they operate, and can wield significant economic and political power. No international treaties exist to specifically cover the behaviour of companies with regard to human rights, and national legislation is very variable.

==Violations==
{{See also|War|Genocides in history|Human rights defender|Corporate accountability for human rights violations}}
{{category see also|Human rights abuses}}

'''Human rights violations''' occur when actions by state (or non-state) actors abuse, ignore, or deny basic human rights (including civil, political, cultural, social, and economic rights). Furthermore, violations of human rights can occur when any state or non-state actor breaches any part of the UDHR treaty or other international human rights or humanitarian law.&lt;ref&gt;There is an ongoing debate on the relationship between the two branches of law. 
* {{cite journal|last1=Koskenniemi|first1=Marti|title=Fragmentation of International Law?

&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to human rights violations of [[United Nations]] laws, Article 39 of the [[United Nations Charter]] designates the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] (or an appointed authority) as the only tribunal that may determine UN human rights violations.

Human rights abuses are monitored by United Nations committees, national institutions and governments and by many independent [[non-governmental organisations]], such as [[Amnesty International]], [[International Federation of Human Rights]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[World Organisation Against Torture]], [[Freedom House]], [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] and [[Anti-Slavery International]]. These organisations collect evidence and documentation of alleged human rights abuses and apply pressure to enforce human rights laws.

[[Wars of aggression]], [[war crime]]s and [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]], including [[genocide]], are breaches of [[International humanitarian law]] and represent the most serious of human rights violations.

In efforts to eliminate violations of human rights, building awareness and protesting inhumane treatment has often led to calls for action and sometimes improved conditions. The UN Security Council has interceded with peace keeping forces, and other states and treaties (NATO) have intervened in situations to protect human rights.

==Substantive rights==
{{see also|Substantive rights}}

===Right to life===
{{Main|Right to life}}
{{quote|Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.|Article 6.1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights}}
The right to life is the essential right that a human being has the right not to be killed by another human being. The [[concept]] of a right to life is central to debates on the issues of [[abortion]], [[capital punishment]], [[euthanasia]], [[Self-defense (theory)|self defence]] and [[Just War|war]]. According to many human rights activists, the [[death penalty]] violates this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty |title=Abolish the death penalty |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Nations]] has called on states retaining the death penalty to establish a moratorium on capital punishment with a view to its abolition.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations resolution 62/149.&lt;/ref&gt; States which do not do so face considerable moral and political pressure.

===Freedom from torture===
{{Main|Torture}}

Throughout history, torture has been used as a method of political [[Mind control|re-education]], interrogation, punishment, and coercion. In addition to state-sponsored torture, individuals or groups may be motivated to inflict torture on others for similar reasons to those of a state; however, the motive for torture can also be for the [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] gratification of the torturer, as in the [[Moors murders]].

Since the mid-20th century, torture is prohibited under [[international law]] and the domestic laws of most countries. It is considered to be a violation of human rights, and is declared to be unacceptable by Article 5 of the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Signatories of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and the [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of June 8, 1977 officially agree not to torture captured persons in [[armed conflicts]], whether international or internal. Torture is also prohibited by the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], which has been ratified by 157 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Freedom from slavery===
{{Main|Slavery}}
Freedom from slavery is internationally recognised as a human right. Article 4 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states:

===Freedom of speech===
{{Main|Freedom of speech}}
Freedom of speech is the freedom to speak freely without censorship. The term freedom of expression is sometimes used synonymously, but includes any act of seeking, receiving and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used. In practice, the right to freedom of speech is not absolute in any country and the right is commonly subject to limitations, such as on libel, slander, obscenity, blasphemy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laws Penalizing Blasphemy, Apostasy and Defamation of Religion are Widespread |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/11/21/laws-penalizing-blasphemy-apostasy-and-defamation-of-religion-are-widespread/ |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Pew Research Center |date=21 November 2012 |quote=s of 2011 nearly half of the countries and territories in the world (47%) have laws or policies that penalize blasphemy, apostasy (abandoning one’s faith) or defamation (disparagement or criticism of particular religions or religion in general). Of the 198 countries studied, 32 (16%) have anti-blasphemy laws, 20 (10%) have laws penalizing apostasy and 87 (44%) have laws against the defamation of religion, including hate speech against members of religious groups.}}&lt;/ref&gt; incitement to commit a crime, etc.
The right to freedom of expression is recognised as a human right under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recognised in international human rights law in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 19 of the ICCPR states that "[e]veryone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference" and "everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice".

===Freedom of thought, conscience and religion===
{{Main|Freedom of thought|Conscience|Freedom of religion}}

{{quote|Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.|Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights}}
Freedom of thought, conscience and religion are closely related rights that protect the [[Political freedom|freedom]] of an individual or community, in public or private, to think and freely hold conscientious beliefs and to manifest [[religion]] or [[belief]] in [[religious education|teaching]], practice, [[worship]], and observance; the concept is generally recognised also to include the freedom to [[Religious conversion|change religion]] or [[Irreligion by country|not to follow any religion]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom to ''leave'' or discontinue membership in a religion or religious group—in religious terms called "[[apostasy]]"—is also a fundamental part of religious freedom, covered by Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights |publisher=The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights groups such as [[Amnesty International]] organises campaigns to protect those arrested and or incarcerated as a [[prisoner of conscience]] because of their conscientious beliefs, particularly concerning intellectual, political and artistic freedom of expression and association.&lt;ref&gt;For example see Jan Brabec, Václav Havel, Ivan Lamper, David Nemec, Petr Placak, Joska Skalnik ''et al.'' [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4151 "Prisoners of Conscience"]. ''New York Review of Books''. 1989; 36 (1) February 2. Accessed October 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In legislation, a [[conscience clause (medical)|conscience clause]] is a provision in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying with the law (for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical [[abortion]]) if it is incompatible with religious or conscientious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=White |first1=Katherine A. |title=Crisis of Conscience: Reconciling Religious Health Care Providers' Beliefs and Patients' Rights |journal=Stanford Law Review |date=1999 |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=1703–1749 |doi=10.2307/1229534 |pmid=10558539|url=https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/stflr51&amp;section=62 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |jstor=1229534 |hdl=10822/925276 |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of movement===
{{Main|Freedom of movement}}

Freedom of movement asserts that a citizen of a state in which that citizen is present has the liberty to travel, reside in, and/or work in any part of the state where one pleases within the limits of respect for the liberty and rights of others,&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;Jérémiee Gilbert, ''Nomadic Peoples and Human Rights'' (2014), p. 73: "Freedom of movement within a country encompasses both the right to travel freely within the territory of the State and the right to relocate oneself and to choose one's place of residence".&lt;/ref&gt; and to leave that state and return at any time.

===Rights debates===
Events and new possibilities can affect existing rights or require new ones. Advances of technology, medicine, and philosophy constantly challenge the [[status quo]] of human rights thinking.

'''Right to education'''

UN agencies, such as UNESCO, promote the right to education as a fundamental right. Education encompasses several thematic areas, including comprehensive sexuality education, which is also considered to be relevant for human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Right to keep and bear arms====

====Future generations====
In 1997, [[UNESCO]] adopted the ''Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation''. The Declaration opens with the words:

{{quote|Mindful of the will of the peoples, set out solemnly in the [[Charter of the United Nations]], to 'save succeeding generations from the scourge of war' and to safeguard the values and principles enshrined in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], and all other relevant instruments of international law.|Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation}}

Article 1 of the declaration states "the present generations have the responsibility of ensuring that the needs and interests of present and future generations are fully safeguarded". The preamble to the declaration states that "at this point in history, the very existence of humankind and its environment are threatened" and the declaration covers a variety of issues including protection of the [[Natural environment|environment]], the [[human genome]], [[biodiversity]], cultural heritage, [[peace]], development, and [[education]]. The preamble recalls that the responsibilities of the present generations towards future generations has been referred to in various international instruments, including the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (UNESCO 1972), the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] and the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]] (UN Conference on Environment and Development, 1992), the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] (World Conference on Human Rights, 1993) and a number of UN General Assembly resolutions relating to the protection of the global climate for present and future generations adopted since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13178&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual orientation and gender identity rights relate to the expression of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] based on the right to respect for private life and the right not to be discriminated against on the ground of "other status" as defined in various human rights conventions, such as article 17 and 26 in the United Nations [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|article 8]] and [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 14 - discrimination|article 14]] in the European Convention on Human Rights.

A global charter for sexual orientation and gender identity rights has been proposed in the form of the '[[Yogyakarta Principles]]', a set of 29 principles whose authors say they apply [[International Human Rights Law]] statutes and precedent to situations relevant to LGBT people's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title= The Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The principles were presented at a [[United Nations]] event in New York on November 7, 2007, co-sponsored by [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]].

The principles have been acknowledged with influencing the French proposed [[Sexual orientation and gender identity at the United Nations|UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]], which focuses on ending violence, criminalisation and capital punishment and does not include dialogue about same-sex marriage or right to start a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franceonu.org/spip.php?article4092 |title=Sexual orientation and gender identity |publisher=France Onu |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The proposal was supported by 67 of the then 192 member countries of the United Nations, including all [[European Union|EU]] member states and the United States. An alternative statement opposing the proposal was initiated by [[Syria]] and signed by 57 member nations, including all 27 nations of the [[Arab League]] as well as [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Trade====
Although both the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] emphasise the importance of a right to work, neither of these documents explicitly mention free trade as a mechanism for ensuring this fundamental right. And yet trade plays a key role in providing jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some experts argue that trade is inherent to human nature and that when governments inhibit international trade they directly inhibit the right to work and the other indirect benefits, like the right to education, that increased work and investment help accrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Others have argued that the ability to trade does not affect everyone equally—often groups like the rural poor, indigenous groups and women are less likely to access the benefits of increased trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On the other hand, others think that it is no longer primarily individuals but companies that trade, and therefore it cannot be guaranteed as a human right.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Additionally, trying to fit too many concepts under the umbrella of what qualifies as a human right has the potential to dilute their importance.

====Water and sanitation====
{{Main|Human right to water and sanitation}}
{{See also|Water politics}}

The right to water has been recognised in a wide range of international documents, including treaties, declarations and other standards. For instance, the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[CEDAW]]) requires State parties to ensure to women the right to "enjoy adequate living conditions, particularly in relation to … water supply". The 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) requires States parties to combat disease and malnutrition "through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking-water".

The most clear definition of the human right to water has been issued by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This treaty body interpreting legal obligations of State parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ([[ICESCR]]) issued in 2002 a non-binding interpretation affirming that access to water was a condition for the enjoyment of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] and inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of health (see ICESCR Art. 11 &amp; 12) and therefore a human right:

{{quote|The human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses.|United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights}}

On July 28, 2010, the United Nations General Assembly declared water and [[sanitation]] as human rights. Since then, all States have at least ratified one human rights convention which explicitly or implicitly recognises the right, and they all have signed at least one political declaration recognising this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml|title=International Decade for Action 'Water for Life' 2005-2015.

====Sexual and reproductive rights====
{{Main|reproductive rights}}
Human rights include women's rights and sexual and reproductive rights. Sexual and reproductive rights are part of a continuum of human rights, which includes the rights to life, health and education, the rights to equality and non-discrimination, and the right to decide the timing, number and spacing of one's children.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/human-rights|title=Human rights - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COOK"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Cook|first1= Rebecca J. |last2= Fathalla |first2= Mahmoud F.|date=September 1996|title= Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing|journal= International Family Planning Perspectives|volume= 22|issue= 3|pages= 115–121|doi= 10.2307/2950752|jstor= 2950752|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive and sexual rights as part of human rights was affirmed internationally at the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo in 1994.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; It was the first among international development frameworks to address issues related to sexuality, sexual and reproductive health, and reproductive rights.&lt;ref name="Commitment"&gt;{{cite web|title=FROM COMMITMENT TO ACTION ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND RIGHTS|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/Final_UNFPA-UPR-ASSESSMENT_270814..pdf|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICPD Programme of Action in paragraph 7.2 "defines an individual's sexual and reproductive health as complete well-being related to sexual activity and reproduction. Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) encompass both entitlements and freedoms. This includes the definition of reproductive rights in paragraph 7.3 of the ICPD PoA, which clarifies that these are not a new set of rights but human rights in existing human rights instruments related to sexual and reproductive autonomy and the attainment of sexual and reproductive health.&lt;ref name="Reproductive rights"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reproductive Rights are Human Rights|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/NHRIHandbook.pdf|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action (PfA) expands this definition to cover both sexuality and reproduction by affirming in paragraph 96 the right to exercise control over and make decisions about one’s sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence."&lt;ref name="Commitment"/&gt;

====World Health Organisation====
Reproductive rights were first established as a subset of human rights at the United Nations 1968 International Conference on Human Rights.&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN" /&gt; The sixteenth article of the resulting Proclamation of Teheran states, "Parents have a basic human right to determine [[Freedom of will|freely]] and [[Moral responsibility|responsibly]] the number and the spacing of their children."&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"&gt;{{cite journal

====Information and communication technologies====
{{Main|Right to Internet access |Digital rights}}

In October 2009, [[Finland]]'s [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Finland)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]] announced that every person in Finland would have the legal right to Internet access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= December 15, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since July 2010, the government has legally obligated [[telecommunications companies]] to offer broadband Internet access to every permanent residence and office. The connection must be "reasonably priced" and have a downstream rate of at least 1 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

 |accessdate= December 15, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the [[BBC]], having commissioned an [[opinion poll]], reported that "almost four in five people around the world believe that access to the internet is a fundamental right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==== Right to non-refoulement vs. right to asylum ====
Non-refoulement is the right not to be returned to a place of persecution and is the foundation for international refugee law, as outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|url = http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/StatusOfRefugees.aspx|website = www.ohchr.org|accessdate = September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the right to non-refoulement and the right to asylum have taken centre stage in recent debates over the treatment of refugees. A central worry about the right to asylum is that it can limit a state's power to handle a mass influx of refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Frontier Justice: The Global Refugee Crisis and What To Do About It|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Frontier_Justice.html?id=VRSQQO-O0u0C|publisher = Doubleday Canada|date = April 5, 2011|isbn = 9780307367921|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 141–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processing asylum applications can take a considerable amount of time, and this amount rises with the number of refugees applying. This creates an incentive for more refugees to apply, since they are allowed to stay in the country during the application process. One potential solution to the problem of mass influx is proposed by U.S.-based political philosopher Andy Lamey. Lamey proposes a portable procedural model that focuses on the right to non-refoulement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Frontier Justice: The Global Refugee Crisis and What To Do About It|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Frontier_Justice.html?id=VRSQQO-O0u0C|publisher = Doubleday Canada|date = April 5, 2011|isbn = 9780307367921|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 232–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, the procedural rights defended by this model can be applied outside national borders, within any rights respecting country; this allows the burden of mass influx to be shared by a plurality of countries without violating the procedural rights of the refugee.

==Relationship with other topics==

===The environment===
There are two basic conceptions of environmental human rights in the current human rights system. The first is that the right to a healthy or adequate environment is itself a human right (as seen in both Article 24 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], and Article 11 of the San Salvador Protocol to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title= OAS – Organization of American States: Democracy for peace, security, and development
 |publisher= Oas.org
 |accessdate= August 29, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second conception is the idea that environmental human rights can be derived from other human rights, usually – the right to life, the right to health, the right to private family life and the right to property (among many others). This second theory enjoys much more widespread use in human rights courts around the world, as those rights are contained in many human rights documents.

The onset of various [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]], especially [[climate change]], has created potential conflicts between different human rights. Human rights ultimately require a working ecosystem and healthy environment, but the granting of certain rights to individuals may damage these. Such as the conflict between right to decide number of offspring and the common need for a healthy environment, as noted in the [[tragedy of the commons]].&lt;ref name="hardin68"&gt;Garrett Hardin, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 "The Tragedy of the Commons"], ''Science'', Vol. 162, No. 3859 (December 13, 1968), pp. 1243–1248. Also available here [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the area of environmental rights, the responsibilities of multinational corporations, so far relatively unaddressed by human rights legislation, is of paramount consideration.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

[[Environmental rights]] revolve largely around the idea of a right to a livable environment both for the present and the future generations.

===National security===
{{See also|National security|Anti-terrorism legislation}}

With the exception of non-derogable human rights (international conventions class the right to life, the right to be free from slavery, the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from retroactive application of penal laws as non-derogable),&lt;ref name=resourceII&gt;{{cite web

===Relativism and universalism===
{{Main|Cultural relativism|Moral relativism|Moral universalism}}
[[File:White mans burden the journal detroit.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Relativists argue that human rights must avoid pushing the values of a single culture at the expense of others. "[[The White Man's Burden]]" is seen as an example of the West using the spread of Western culture as a justification for colonisation.]]
[[File:Fgm map.gif|right|thumb|upright=0.9|Universalists argue that some practices violate the norms of all human cultures. They point out that although [[Female genital mutilation]] is prevalent in Africa, no religion supports the practice, and the tradition is in violation of women's rights.]]

The UDHR enshrines universal rights that apply to all humans equally, whichever geographical location, state, race or culture they belong to. However, in academia there is a dispute between scholars that advocate [[moral relativism]] and scholars that advocate [[moral universalism]]. Relativists do not argue against human rights, but concede that human rights are [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]] and are shaped by cultural and environmental contexts. Universalists argue that human rights have always existed, and apply to all people regardless of culture, race, sex, or religion.

More specifically, proponents of cultural relativism argue for acceptance of different cultures, which may have practices conflicting with human rights. Relativists caution that universalism could be used as a form of cultural, economic or political imperialism. [[The White Man's Burden]] is used as an example of imperialism and the destruction of local cultures justified by the desire to spread [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] values.&lt;ref&gt;"Eurocentrism". In ''Encyclopedia of the Developing World''. Ed. Thomas M. Leonard, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-97662-6}}, p. 636.&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically [[liberalism|liberal]] outlook which, although generally accepted in Europe, [[human rights in Japan|Japan]] or North America, is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Opponents of relativism argue that some practices exist that violate the norms of all human cultures. A common example is [[female genital mutilation]], which occurs in different cultures in Africa, Asia and South America.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is not mandated by any religion, but has become a tradition in many cultures. It is considered a violation of women's and girl's rights by much of the international community, and is outlawed in some countries.

The former Prime Ministers of [[Singapore]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]], and of [[Malaysia]], [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] both claimed in the 1990s that ''[[Asian values]]'' were significantly different from Western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity, and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in Asia than democracy. [[Lee Kuan Yew]] argued that:

{{quote|What Asians value may not necessarily be what Americans or Europeans value. Westerners value the freedoms and liberties of the individual. As an Asian of Chinese cultural background, my values are for a government which is honest, effective, and efficient.|[[Lee Kuan Yew]], ''Democracy, Human Rights and the Realities'', Tokyo, Nov 10, 1992&lt;ref&gt;Halper, Stefan. ''The Beijing consensus''. p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response, critics have pointed out that cultural relativism could be used as a justification for authoritarianism. An example is in 1981, when the Iranian representative to the [[United Nations]], Said Rajaie-Khorassani, articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by saying that the UDHR was "a [[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Littman1999"&gt;Littman (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Asian Values argument was criticised by Mahathir's former deputy:

{{quote|To say that freedom is Western or unAsian is to offend our traditions as well as our forefathers, who gave their lives in the struggle against tyranny and injustices.|[[Anwar Ibrahim|A. Ibrahim]] in his keynote speech to the Asian Press Forum titled ''Media and Society in Asia'', December 2, 1994}}

and by Singapore's opposition leader [[Chee Soon Juan]], who states that it is racist to assert that Asians do not want human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ball|Gready|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of moral universalism argue that relativistic arguments neglect the fact that modern human rights are new to all cultures, dating back no further than the UDHR in 1948. They argue that the UDHR was drafted by people from many different cultures and traditions, including a US Roman Catholic, a Chinese Confucian philosopher, a French zionist and a representative from the Arab League, amongst others, and drew upon advice from thinkers such as Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref name="Gready34"/&gt; [[Michael Ignatieff]] has argued that cultural relativism is almost exclusively an argument used by those who wield power in cultures which commit human rights abuses, and that those whose human rights are compromised are the powerless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ignatieff|2001|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture.

Although the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete, it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable. The [[2005 World Summit]] reaffirmed the international community's adherence to this principle:

{{quote|The universal nature of human rights and freedoms is beyond question.|2005 World Summit, paragraph 121}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6041">{{short description|defines two sets of codes for a number of writing systems}}
'''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 15924''', '''Codes for the representation of names of scripts''', defines two sets of codes for a number of [[writing system]]s (scripts). Each script is given both a four-letter code and a numeric one.&lt;ref name=ISO-15924:2004&gt;{{cite web|last=Everson|first=Michael|title=ISO 15924:2004|url=http://unicode.org/iso15924/|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Script is defined as "set of graphic characters used for the written form of one or more languages".&lt;ref name=ISO-15924:2004 /&gt; 

Where possible the codes are derived from [[ISO 639-2]] where the name of a script and the name of a language using the script are identical (example: [[Gujarati script|Gujarātī]] ISO 639 guj, ISO 15924 Gujr). Preference is given to the 639-2 Bibliographical codes, which is different from the otherwise often preferred use of the Terminological codes.&lt;ref name=ISO-15924:2004 /&gt;

4-letter ISO 15924 codes are incorporated into the Language Subtag Registry for [[IETF language tag]]s and so can be used in file formats that make use of such language tags. For example, they can be used in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] to help [[Web browser]]s determine which [[typeface]] to use for foreign text. This way one could differentiate, for example, between [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbian]] written in the Cyrillic (&lt;code&gt;sr-Cyrl&lt;/code&gt;) or Latin (&lt;code&gt;sr-Latn&lt;/code&gt;) script, or mark [[romanization|romanized]] text as such.

==Maintenance==
ISO has appointed the [[Unicode Consortium]] as the Registration Authority (RA) for the standard. In 2004, the RA appointed [[Michael Everson]] to act as Registrar. The Registrar works with a Joint Advisory Committee (JAC) in developing and implementing the standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/iso15924/ Unicode - ISO 15924 Registration Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; The JAC contains six members: the Registrar, one member from the Library of Congress, one from Standards Norway, one from the French Encyclopaedia Universalis, an officer of Unicode, and a member of Unicode. These individuals represent the interests of the ISO 15924 RA, the ISO 639-2 RA, ISO Technical Committee 37, ISO Technical Committee 46, and the ISO Coded Character Set Sub-Committee, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2.&lt;ref name="JAC info"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Advisory Committee ISO 15924 /RA-JAC|url=http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924jac.html|publisher=ISO, Unicode, Inc. &amp; Evertype|accessdate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, Revision 1.1 clarified that codes in the 700s were reserved for "Shorthands and other notations", although that revision is only provisional until it can be confirmed by governing committees.&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;800–899&lt;/tt&gt; (unassigned)

'''Intentionality''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] concept and is defined by the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' as "the power of minds to be about, to represent, or to stand for, things, properties and states of affairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/intentionality/ |title=Intentionality |date=Aug 31, 2010 |author=Jacob, P.  |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The once obsolete term dates from medieval [[scholastic philosophy]], but in more recent times it has been resurrected by [[Franz Brentano]] and adopted by [[Edmund Husserl]].  The earliest theory of intentionality is associated with [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]]'s [[ontological argument]] for the [[existence of God]], and with his tenets distinguishing between objects that exist in the understanding and objects that exist in reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chisholm, Roderick M. |year=1967 |title=Intentionality |journal=The Encyclopedia of Philosophy |volume=4 |issue= |pages=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview&lt;!--'Act psychology' and 'Intentionalism (philosophy of mind)' redirect here--&gt; ==
The concept of intentionality was reintroduced in 19th-century contemporary [[philosophy]] by [[Franz Brentano]] (a German philosopher and [[Psychology|psychologist]] who is generally regarded as the founder of &lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;'''act psychology''', also called &lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;'''intentionalism''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/Franz-Brentano Franz Brentano – Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in his work ''[[Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint]]'' (1874). Brentano described intentionality as a characteristic of all acts of [[consciousness]] that are thus "psychical" or "mental" phenomena, by which they may be set apart from "physical" or "natural" phenomena.
{{quote|Every mental phenomenon is characterized by what the Scholastics of the Middle Ages called the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an object, and what we might call, though not wholly unambiguously, reference to a content, direction towards an object (which is not to be understood here as meaning a thing), or immanent objectivity. Every mental phenomenon includes something as object within itself, although they do not all do so in the same way. In presentation something is presented, in judgement something is affirmed or denied, in love loved, in hate hated, in desire desired and so on. This intentional in-existence is characteristic exclusively of mental phenomena. No physical phenomenon exhibits anything like it. We could, therefore, define mental phenomena by saying that they are those phenomena which contain an object intentionally within themselves.| Franz Brentano|source=''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'', edited by Linda L. McAlister (London: Routledge, 1995), pp. 88–89.}}

Brentano coined the expression "intentional inexistence" to indicate the peculiar [[ontological]] status of the contents of mental phenomena. According to some interpreters the "in-" of "in-existence" is to be read as locative, i.e. as indicating that "an intended object ... exists in or has ''in-existence'', existing not externally but in the psychological state" (Jacquette 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;102), while others are more cautious, stating: "It is not clear whether in 1874 this ... was intended to carry any ontological commitment" (Chrudzimski and Smith 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;205).

A major problem within discourse on intentionality is that participants often fail to make explicit whether or not they use the term to imply concepts such as agency or desire, i.e. whether it involves [[teleology]]. Dennett (see below) explicitly invokes teleological concepts in the "[[intentional stance]]". However, most philosophers use "intentionality" to mean something with no teleological import. Thus, a thought of a chair can be about a chair without any implication of an intention or even a belief relating to the chair. For philosophers of language, what is meant by intentionality is largely an issue of how symbols can have meaning. This lack of clarity may underpin some of the differences of view indicated below.

To bear out further the diversity of sentiment evoked from the notion of intentionality, [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] followed on Brentano, and gave the concept of intentionality more widespread attention, both in [[continental philosophy|continental]] and [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=David Woodruff|title=Husserl|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-28974-2|pages=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-TD3QmLHtgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to Brentano's view, French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (''[[Being and Nothingness]]'') identified  intentionality with [[consciousness]], stating that the two were indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jean-Paul Sartre |coauthors= |title=Being and Nothingness |year=2012 |publisher=Open Road Media |isbn=1453228551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] (''[[Being and Time]]''), defined intentionality as "[[Heideggerian terminology|care]]" (''Sorge''), a [[sentience|sentient]] condition where an individual's existence, [[facticity]], and being in the world identifies their ontological significance, in contrast to that which is merely [[ontic]] ("thinghood").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin Heidegger |coauthors= |title=Being and Time |year=1967  |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=84 |isbn=0631197702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other 20th-century philosophers such as [[Gilbert Ryle]] and [[A.J. Ayer]] were critical of Husserl's concept of intentionality and his many layers of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayer|first=A.J.|title=More of My Life|year=1984|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=0-19-281878-3|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ryle insisted that perceiving is not a process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Locke|first=Don|title=Perception: And Our Knowledge Of The External World, Volume 3|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-29562-9|pages=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmlmLuQU4OAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ayer that describing one's knowledge is not to describe mental processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Macdonald|first=Graham|title=Alfred Jules Ayer|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ayer/#5|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect of these positions is that consciousness is so fully intentional that the mental act has been emptied of all content, and that the idea of pure consciousness is that it is nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siewert|first=Charles|title=Consciousness and Intentionality|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-intentionality/#PheConInt|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Sartre also referred to "consciousness" as "[[nothing]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franchi|first=Leo|title=Sartre and Freedom|url=http://files.lfranchi.com/papers/sartre.and.freedom.pdf|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platonist]] [[Roderick Chisholm]] has revived the Brentano thesis through linguistic analysis, distinguishing two parts to Brentano's concept, the ontological aspect and the psychological aspect.&lt;ref name=byrne&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=Alex|title=Intentionality|url=http://mit.edu/abyrne/www/intentionality.html|work=Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chisholm's writings have attempted to summarize the suitable and unsuitable criteria of the concept since the Scholastics, arriving at a criterion of intentionality identified by the two aspects of Brentano's thesis and defined by the logical properties that distinguish language describing psychological phenomena from language describing non-psychological phenomena.&lt;ref name=bechtel&gt;{{cite book|last=Bechtel|first=William|title=Philosophy of Mind: An Overview for Cognitive Science|year=1988|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale NJ|isbn=978-0805802214|pages=44–47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKbTvOBByQcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chisholm's criteria for the intentional use of sentences are: existence independence, truth-value indifference, and [[opaque context|referential opacity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horosz|first=William and Tad S.

In current [[artificial intelligence]] and [[philosophy of mind]], intentionality is sometimes linked with questions of semantic inference, with both skeptical and supportive adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Might the Singularity never occur?|url=http://singularity.org/singularity-faq/#r38|work=Singularity FAQ|publisher=Singularity Institute|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Searle]] argued for this position with the [[Chinese room]] thought experiment, according to which no [[syntactic]] operations that occurred in a computer would provide it with [[semantic]] content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marconi|first=Diego|title="On the Referential Competence of Some Machines", in Integration of Natural Language and Vision Processing: Theory and Grounding Representations, Volume 3, edited by Paul Mc Kevitt|year=1996|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-9401072335|pages=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72dw2jkKfIwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are more skeptical of the human ability to make such an assertion, arguing that the kind of intentionality that emerges from self-organizing networks of automata will always be undecidable because it will never be possible to make our subjective introspective experience of intentionality and decision making coincide with our objective observation of the behavior of a self-organizing machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atlan|first=H.|title="Ends and Means in Machine-Like Systems", in New Perspectives on Cybernetics: Self-Organization, Autonomy and Connectionism,  edited by Gertrudis Van de Vijver|year=1991|publisher=Sringer|location=New York|isbn=978-9048141074|pages=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqI68ZBMGk4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dennett's taxonomy of current theories about intentionality ==
[[Daniel Dennett]] offers a taxonomy of the current theories about intentionality in Chapter 10 of his book ''[[Intentional stance|The Intentional Stance]]''. Most, if not all, current theories on intentionality accept Brentano's thesis of the irreducibility of intentional idiom. From this thesis the following positions emerge:
* intentional idiom is problematic for [[natural science|science]];
* intentional idiom is not problematic for science, which is divided into:
** [[Eliminative Materialism]];
** [[Epistemological realism|Realism]];
** Quinean double standard (see below) which is divided into:
*** adherence to Normative Principle (epistemology), which is divided into:
**** who makes an Assumption of Rationality;
**** who follows the [[Principle of charity|Principle of Charity]];
*** adherence to Projective Principle.

[[Roderick Chisholm]] (1956), [[G.E.M. Anscombe]] (1957), [[Peter Geach]] (1957), and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] (1964) all adhere to the former position, namely that intentional idiom is problematic and cannot be integrated with the natural sciences. Members of this category also maintain realism in regard to intentional objects, which may imply some kind of dualism (though this is debatable).

The latter position, which maintains the unity of intentionality with the natural sciences, is further divided into three standpoints:
* '''Eliminative materialism''', supported by [[W.V. Quine]] (1960) and Churchland (1981)
* '''Realism''', advocated by [[Jerry Fodor]] (1975), as well as Burge, Dretske, Kripke, and the early [[Hilary Putnam]]
* those who adhere to the '''Quinean double standard'''.

Proponents of the '''eliminative materialism''', understand intentional idiom, such as "belief", "desire", and the like, to be replaceable either with behavioristic language (e.g. Quine) or with the language of neuroscience (e.g. Churchland).

Holders of '''realism''' argue that there is a deeper fact of the matter to both translation and belief attribution. In other words, manuals for translating one language into another cannot be set up in different yet behaviorally identical ways and ontologically there are intentional objects. Famously, Fodor has attempted to ground such realist claims about intentionality in a language of thought. Dennett comments on this issue, Fodor "attempt[s] to make these irreducible realities acceptable to the physical sciences by grounding them (somehow) in the 'syntax' of a system of physically realized mental representations" (Dennett 1987, 345).

Those who adhere to the so-called '''Quinean double standard''' (namely that ''ontologically there is nothing intentional, but that the language of intentionality is indispensable''), accept Quine's thesis of the [[indeterminacy of translation|indeterminacy of radical translation]] and its implications, while the other positions so far mentioned do not. As Quine puts it, indeterminacy of radical translation is the thesis that "manuals for translating one language into another can be set up in divergent ways, all compatible with the totality of speech dispositions, yet incompatible with one another" (Quine 1960, 27). Quine (1960) and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (1958) both comment on this intermediary position. One such implication would be that there is, in principle, no deeper fact of the matter that could settle two interpretative strategies on what belief to attribute to a physical system. In other words, the behavior (including speech dispositions) of any physical system, in theory, could be interpreted by two different predictive strategies and both would be equally warranted in their belief attribution. This category can be seen to be a medial position between the realists and the eliminativists since it attempts to blend attributes of both into a theory of intentionality. Dennett, for example, argues in ''True Believers'' (1981) that intentional idiom (or "[[folk psychology]]") is a predictive strategy and if such a strategy successfully and voluminously predicts the actions of a physical system, then that physical system can be said to have those beliefs attributed to it. Dennett calls this predictive strategy the [[intentional stance]].

They are further divided into two theses:
* adherence to the '''Normative Principle'''
* adherence to the '''Projective Principle'''

Advocates of the former, the Normative Principle, argue that attributions of intentional idioms to physical systems should be the propositional attitudes that the physical system ought to have in those circumstances (Dennett 1987, 342). However, exponents of this view are still further divided into those who make an '''Assumption of Rationality''' and those who adhere to the '''Principle of Charity'''. Dennett (1969, 1971, 1975), Cherniak (1981, 1986), and the more recent work of Putnam (1983) recommend the Assumption of Rationality, which unsurprisingly assumes that the physical system in question is rational. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] (1967, 1973, 1974, 1985) and Lewis (1974) defend the Principle of Charity.

The latter is advocated by Grandy (1973) and Stich (1980, 1981, 1983, 1984), who maintain that attributions of intentional idioms to any physical system (e.g. humans, artifacts, non-human animals, etc.) should be the propositional attitude (e.g. "belief", "desire", etc.) that one would suppose one would have in the same circumstances (Dennett 1987, 343).

== Basic intentionality types according to Le Morvan ==
Working on the intentionality of vision, belief, and knowledge, Pierre Le Morvan (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pierre Le Morvan |year=2005 |title=Intentionality: Transparent, Translucent, And Opaque |journal=Journal of Philosophical Research |volume=30 |issue= |pages=283–302 |url=http://www.tcnj.edu/~lemorvan/JPR_Proof.pdf |accessdate=21 December 2012 |doi=10.5840/jpr20053039}}&lt;/ref&gt; has distinguished between three basic kinds of intentionality that he dubs "transparent", "translucent", and "opaque" respectively. The threefold distinction may be explained as follows. Let's call the "intendum" what an intentional state is about, and the "intender" the subject who is in the intentional state. An intentional state is transparent if it satisfies the following two conditions: (i) it is genuinely relational in that it entails the existence of not just the intender but the intendum as well, and (ii) substitutivity of identicals applies to the intendum (i.e. if the intentional state is about a, and a = b, then the intentional state is about b as well). An intentional state is translucent if it satisfies (i) but not (ii). An intentional state is opaque if it satisfies neither (i) nor (ii).

== Mental states without intentionality &lt;!--'Anti-intentionalism (philosophy of mind)' redirects here--&gt;==
The claim that all mental states are intentional is called intentionalism, the contrary being &lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;'''anti-intentionalism'''.

Some anti-intentionalism, such as that of [[Ned Block]], is based on the argument that phenomenal conscious experience or [[qualia]] is also a vital component of consciousness, and that it is not intentional. (The latter claim is itself disputed by [[Michael Tye (philosopher)|Michael Tye]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael Tye |year=1995 |title=A Representational Theory of Pains and their Phenomenal Character |journal=Philosophical Perspectives |volume=9 |quote=[T]he phenomenal character of my pain intuitively is something that is given to me via introspection of what I experience in having the pain. But what I experience is what my experience represents. So, phenomenal character is representational. |pages=223–39 |url=http://philpapers.org/rec/TYEART |accessdate=21 December 2012 |doi=10.2307/2214219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of anti-intentionalism associated with [[John Searle]] regards phenomenality itself as the "mark of the mental" and sidelines intentionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intentionality/#10 |title=Is intentionality exhibited by all mental phenomena? |date=Aug 31, 2010 |author=Pierre Jacob |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further form argues that some unusual states of consciousness are non-intentional, although an individual might live a lifetime without experiencing them. [[Robert K.C. Forman]] argues that some of the unusual states of consciousness typical of [[mystical experience]] are '''pure consciousness events''' in which awareness exists, but has no object, is not awareness "of" anything.

=== Intentionality and self-consciousness ===
Several authors have attempted to construct philosophical models describing how intentionality relates to the human capacity to be [[self-consciousness|self-conscious]]. Cedric Evans contributed greatly to the discussion with his "The Subject of Self-Consciousness" in 1970. He centered his model on the idea that executive attention need not be propositional in form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mentalstates.net/3-3-11.html |title=The Subject of Consciousness |year=1970 |author=C.O. Evans |publisher=Mental States |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3215">In [[probability theory]], an '''interacting particle system''' ('''IPS''') is a [[stochastic process]] &lt;math&gt; (X(t))_{t \in \mathbb R^+} &lt;/math&gt; on some configuration space &lt;math&gt; \Omega= S^G &lt;/math&gt; given by a site space, a [[Countable infinite|countable-infinite]] [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; and a local state space, a [[Compact space|compact]] [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;. More precisely IPS are continuous-time [[Markov process|Markov jump processes]] describing the collective behavior of stochastically interacting components. IPS are the continuous-time analogue of [[stochastic cellular automata]].
Among the main examples are the [[voter model]], the [[contact process (mathematics)|contact process]], the [[asymmetric simple exclusion process]] (ASEP), the [[Glauber dynamics]] and in particular the stochastic [[Ising model]].

IPS are usually defined via their [[Infinitesimal generator (stochastic processes)|Markov generator]] giving rise to a unique [[Markov process]] using Markov [[semigroups]] and the [[Hille-Yosida theorem]]. The generator again is given via so-called transition rates &lt;math&gt;c_\Lambda(\eta,\xi)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda\subset G&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of sites and &lt;math&gt;\eta,\xi\in\Omega&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\eta_i=\xi_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i\notin\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The rates describe exponential waiting times of the process to jump from configuration &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; into configuration &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;. More generally the transition rates are given in form of a finite measure &lt;math&gt;c_\Lambda(\eta,d\xi)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;S^\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

The generator &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of an IPS has the following form. First, the domain of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the space of "observables", that is, the set of real valued [[continuous functions]] on the configuration space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Then for any observable &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in the domain of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, one has

&lt;math&gt;Lf(\eta)=\sum_\Lambda\int_{\xi:\xi_{\Lambda^c}=\eta_{\Lambda^c}}c_\Lambda(\eta,d\xi)[f(\xi)-f(\eta)]&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, for the stochastic [[Ising model]] we have &lt;math&gt;G=\mathbb Z^d&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S=\{-1,+1\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_\Lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\Lambda\neq\{i\}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;i\in G&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;c_i(\eta,\eta^i)=\exp[-\beta\sum_{j:|j-i|=1}\eta_i\eta_j]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\eta^i&lt;/math&gt; is the configuration equal to &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; except it is flipped at site &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a new parameter modeling the inverse temperature.

'''Intimization''' is "a revelatory process which involves the publicizing of information and imagery from what we might ordinarily understand as [an individuals’s] personal life – broadly defined. It is a [[publicity]] process (involving the media) that takes place over time and involves flows of personal information and imagery into the [media]".&lt;ref&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; It has mainly been studied as a society wide process in the context of politics although it can apply to other contexts.

==Definitions==
The term intimization was first used and defined as a process by Van Zoonen in her study of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] television news in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Van Zoonen, L.  (1991) A Tyranny of Intimacy? Women Femininity and Television News. In Dahlgren, P and Sparks, C. (eds) Communication and Citizenship: Journalism and Public Sphere. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  She defines it as a process whereby "values from the private sphere are transferred to the public sphere".&lt;ref name="VanZoonen"&gt;Van Zoonen, L.  (1991) A Tyranny of Intimacy? Women Femininity and Television News. In Dahlgren, P and Sparks, C. (eds) Communication and Citizenship: Journalism and Public Sphere. London: Routledge. p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen not only in the greater focus on ‘human interest subjects’ but also in "the way the relation between audience and news reader is constructed... through carefully picked personalities and intimate modes of address".&lt;ref name="VanZoonen" /&gt;

Hirdman [[et al.]] use the term in their study of changes in [[Sweden|Swedish]] journalism from the 1880s. They define intimization as a process which sees increased journalistic attention on the family, sexuality and the private, what they term the ‘intimate sphere’ as opposed to the public sphere.&lt;ref name="Hirdman"&gt;Hirdman, A., Kleberg, M and Widestedt, K. 2005: Intimization of Journalism: Transformations of Medialized Public Spheres from 1880s to Current Times. Nordicom Review, 2 109-117. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that "modes of address, relations to sources, visual representations and focus of texts are seen to interact to create a kind of medial pseudo intimacy."&lt;ref name="Hirdman" /&gt;

The term [[privatization]] has sometimes also been used to signify the same process. Rahat and Sheafer, for example, define privatization as "a media focus on the personal characteristics and personal life of individual candidates."&lt;ref&gt;Rahat G and Sheafer T (2007) 'The personalization(s) of politics: Israel, 1949-2003.' Political Communication 41(1): 65-80. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of this term is problematic as the word, most commonly associated the sale of state-owned assets, means the reverse, privatizing of something that is public not publicizing the private.

Stanyer argues that Intimization as a process relates primarily to media content formation and dissemination in any society and should not be conflated with [[Parasocial interaction|para-social]] or tele-mediated intimacy between audiences and those who appear on TV.&lt;ref&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity&lt;/ref&gt; Horton and  Wohl, writing in the 1950s were particularly interested in the relationship between audience members and those they saw on the TV screen.&lt;ref&gt;Horton, D. and Whol, R Richard. (1956) Mass Communication and Para-social Interaction: Observations on Intimacy at a Distance. Psychiatry, 19: 215-229.&lt;/ref&gt; Horton and  Wohl were not interested in the information and imagery to which audience members were exposed and made no distinction between the public and private matters but were rather interested in their illusory (para-social) relationship between audience members and those they saw on the TV screen. While not downplaying the importance of the audience, Stanyer observes it is the information and imagery to which an audience is exposed that is important in the intimization process. It is the mass exposure of information and imagery from what we might ordinarily understand as the personal / private life of a public figure as opposed to their public/ professional life. Information and imagery we might expect only to be exchanged between those in a close relationship. In other words, public figures (politicians, celebrities, sports stars etc.) are not just familiar to us (that is recognisable) but potentially more information about their personal life circulates in the media, and the audience are exposed to more information from the private lives of public figures. An important distinction is made in this respect between familiarity and intimacy.

Stanyer suggests that flows of information can come from three specific areas or domains of the personal life. ‘The first domain concerns the ‘inner life’ of [a person]. This includes, for example, his or her health, well being, sexuality, personal finances, deeds, misdeeds, key milestones (such as birthdays), life experiences and achievements, but also choices about the way an individual wants to live his or her life: for example, life-style choices, ways of behaving, choice of religion or questions of taste. The second domain concerns significant others in a person’s personal life and his or her relationship with these actors. This includes relationships with partners, other immediate and extended family members, friends and extra-marital lovers. The third domain concerns an individual’s life space: this includes his or her home but it also includes happenings in locations outside the home where the individual is not performing a public function and might want privacy, such as on family holidays’&lt;ref&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity. p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Stanyer observes that intimization consists of "the publicizing of information and imagery from these three domains," he also notes such information can enter the public sphere with or without expressed or implied consent of those in public life and can either be [[scandal]]ous in nature (it reveals a transgression of societal norms) or non-scandalous.&lt;ref name="Stanyer"&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the former "might be an act of self-disclosure on a talk show or in an [[autobiography]] which is then recycled in the media." Example of the latter "might include, [[paparazzi]] photographs of politicians backstage or off-duty, taken without the subject’s permission" revealing an [[extra-marital affair]]&lt;ref name="Stanyer" /&gt;

In sum, drawing on these definitions initimization can be seen as a society wide ‘revelatory process’ which involves the publicizing of information and imagery from the different domains of public figures’ personal lives, either with or without expressed or implied consent of the individual involved.

==Intimization and the media coverage of conventional politics==
The growing visibility of the private lives of public figures has been much commented on but has received little systematic attention. The findings that emerge are somewhat mixed. Errera analyzed coverage of French politicians’ private lives in two magazines ''[[Paris Match]]'' and ''[[VSD (French magazine)|VSD]]'' over a seven-year period between 1990 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Errera C (2006) 'La vie privée des politiques, un tabou de la politique française.' Communication et langages 148(1): 81-102.&lt;/ref&gt; She found that politicians’ relationships, personal health, their home and family life, personal financial issues and their past life were very much to the fore in the magazines’ coverage especially of leading French politicians, such as, [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[François Mitterrand]].

In terms of newspaper articles referring to UK national leaders’ personal lives, Langer found a clear upward trend over time.&lt;ref&gt;Langer AI (2007) 'A Historical Exploration of the Personalisation of Politics in the Print Media: The British Prime Ministers 1945–1999.' Parliamentary Affairs 60(3): 371-387. p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; The coverage of their private lives rose from around 1% of the leader’s coverage in 1945 to 8% during [[Tony Blair]]’s tenure in office (2007). A follow up study (period 2007-2008) showed that the coverage of opposition leader [[David Cameron]] was even more focused on his private life than that of Tony Blair, while that of Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] was less, suggesting the importance of  specific leaders for the amount of attention their private life receives.&lt;ref&gt;Langer AI (2010) 'The Politicization of Private Persona: Exceptional Leaders or the New Rule? The Case of the United Kingdom and the Blair Effect.' International Journal of Press Politics 15(1): 60-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Rahat and Sheafer, who looked at election coverage in two leading Israeli newspapers for 16 campaigns between 1949 and 2003, found no significant trend in media coverage of candidates’ personal life, with the focus on personal life never exceeding 15% of the news items over time.&lt;ref&gt;Rahat G and Sheafer T (2007) 'The personalization(s) of politics: Israel, 1949-2003.' Political Communication 41(1): 65-80. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only comparative research conducted so far by Stanyer found some interesting cross national differences. Looking at non-scandalous and scandalous media coverage in seven democracies (Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and the US) the research found that intimization is more prevalent in the UK and US compared to the other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Stanyer, J. (2012) Intimate Politics: Publicity, Privacy and the Personal Lives of Politicians in Media Saturated Democracies. Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanyer argues that there is no magic causal [[silver bullet]], such as, new communication technologies, or tabloidization that can explain the difference between countries. Rather, the outcome is the result of a complex interplay of necessary and sufficient factors operating in conjunction. These include: personal factors including the age of the politician, media conditions, such as the size of the [[tabloid press]] and presence and absence of privacy protection for public figures, and political factors, such as the nature of the political system.

==History==
In 1982, Alvin and Debbie McCuan's two daughters, coached by their step-grandmother Mary Ann Barbour, who had custody of them, alleged they had been abused by their parents, and accused them of being part of a sex ring that included Scott and Brenda Kniffen. The Kniffens' two sons also claimed to have been abused. No physical evidence was ever found. The McCuans and Kniffens were convicted in 1984 and given a combined sentence of over 1000 years in prison.&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ra_baker.htm |title=Kern County ritual abuse cases |accessdate=2007-08-26 |quote=The triggering incident occurred in 1980 when Becky McCuan disclosed that her grandfather, Rod Phelps, had touched her inappropriately. The family doctor confirmed the abuse.  |publisher=Religious Tolerance }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convictions were overturned in 1996 and the two couples were released. In 2001, a TV movie about the Kniffens titled ''Just Ask My Children'' was aired on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280474/|title=Just Ask My Children|date=10 September 2001|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six similar cases occurred throughout Kern County. For instance, the testimony of five young boys was the prosecution's key evidence in a trial in which four defendants were convicted. John Stoll, a 41-year-old carpenter, received the longest sentence of the group: 40 years for 17 counts of lewd and lascivious conduct. "It never happened," Ed Sampley, one of the accusers, told a ''New York Times'' reporter in 2004. He claimed he had lied about Stoll. Stoll was in prison for 19 years before his conviction was reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/01/local/me-stoll1 Conviction reversed after 19 years], [[Los Angeles Times]], John Johnson, May 1, 2004. Retrieved 11 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Stoll sued Kern County and was awarded $5 million in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090930214951/http://www.wrongfulconvictionlawsuitdefense.com/2009/09/articles/news/john-stoll-to-receive-5m-settlement-in-20-year-wrongful-conviction-case-featured-in-the-documentary-witch-hunt/ Web.archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The county paid out nearly $10 million to settle claims made by the former prisoners and the alleged victims.&lt;ref name=edj&gt;{{cite news|title=Crusading Calif.

MSNBC also made a documentary on John Stoll and the Kern County cases.

Sampley and three other former accusers returned in 2004 to the courthouse where they had testified against Stoll, this time to say that Stoll never molested them. In their late 20s, each of them said he always knew the truth—that Stoll had never touched them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/19/magazine/19KIDSL.html|title=Who Was Abused?|date=19 September 2004|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stoll's son has "continued to say that he had been molested."&lt;ref name=Logan&gt;{{cite news|last=Logan |first=Jessica |title=Prosecutor's fire makes her either loved or loathed |publisher=The Bakersfield Californian |date=2005-05-31 |url=http://www.bakersfield.com/862/story/100201.html |accessdate=2008-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827235257/http://bakersfield.com/862/story/100201.html |archivedate=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case, the only defendant with a previous conviction of molestation was Grant Self, who rented Stoll's pool house briefly.&lt;ref name=Branco&gt;{{cite news|last=Branco|first=Shellie|title=Ruling puts man back in hospital|publisher=The Bakersfield Californian|date=2007-04-18|url=http://www.bakersfield.com/619/story/122888.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113056/http://www.bakersfield.com/619/story/122888.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-03-04|accessdate=2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Stoll had to wait until 2004 for the reversal of his convictions, but was released on the new testimony.

Prior to the start of the Kern County child abuse cases, several local social workers had attended a training seminar that foregrounded satanic ritual abuse as a major element in child sexual abuse, and had used the now-debunked memoir ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' as training material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20110522150523/http://members.shaw.ca/imaginarycrimes/michelleremembers.htm Archive.is]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ‘’’Laius complex’’’ revolves around the paternal wish for [[filicide]], particularly for the extinction of the male heir, in an attempt to ensure one will have no successors.

==Mythological background==
Indo-European mythology contains a number of stories of foundlings, like [[Cyrus the Great]] or [[Romulus and Remus]], outcast after a prophesy that they will replace the dynasty into which they are born.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marino, in R. Preiss ed., ''Childhood, Education and the Stage in Early Modern England'' (Cambridge 2017) pp. 232–3&lt;/ref&gt;  In Greek mythology, [[Cronus]] (Roman [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]) had devoured his young because of his fear that one would supersede him.&lt;ref&gt;F Guirand, ''New Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology'' (London 1968) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laius]] in the story of [[Oedipus]] similarly casts the latter out to die as an infant because of (in the words of [[Sophocles]]) "some wicked spell … . Saying the child would kill its father".&lt;ref&gt;Sophocles, ''The Theban Plays'' (Penguin 1973) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==From myth to complex==
Whereas [[Freud]] had laid stress on Oedipus’s filial violence against his father, [[George Devereux]] in 1953 introduced the term 'Laius complex' to cover the corresponding feelings on the part of the father – what he called the "'counter-oedipal' (Laius) complex".&lt;ref&gt;G Devereux, ''Dreams in Greek Tragedy'' (1976) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Later explorations of [[masculinity]] have placed the aggressive aspects of the Laius complex within the broader frame of mammalian aggression against their young:&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Ross, ''What Men Want'' (1995) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; what [[Gershon Legman]] called "the killing of the male (i.e. sexually uninteresting) children by the father".&lt;ref&gt;G Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke I'' (1973) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Two specific psychosexual aspects of the complex have been particularly highlighted.  One lays stress on the magical thinking behind the complex – the unconscious belief that if one has no successors, one will be effectively immortal.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marino, in R. Preiss ed., ''Childhood, Education and the Stage in Early Modern England'' (Cambridge 2017) p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; The other emphasises the [[narcissism]] in the Laius/Oedipus relationship – the belief that there is only room for a single figure to exist in life, leading inevitably to the destruction of the one or the other competitor, father or son.&lt;ref&gt;H. Faimberg, ''The Telescoping of Generations'' (2005) pp. 72–3&lt;/ref&gt;

How far the playing down of the Laius neurosis (in orthodox psychoanalysis)&lt;ref&gt;H. Faimberg, ''The Telescoping of Generations'' (2005) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; can be linked to what [[Julia Kristeva]] called Freud's "paternal vision of childhood",&lt;ref&gt;J. Kristeva, ''Desire in Language'' (New York 1980) pp. 274–5 &lt;/ref&gt; remains for the 21st century an open question.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marino, in R. Preiss ed., ''Childhood, Education and the Stage in Early Modern England'' (Cambridge 2017) pp. 229–31&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21914">'''Liberation psychology''' or '''liberation social psychology''' is an approach to psychology that aims to actively understand the psychology of oppressed and impoverished communities by conceptually and practically addressing the oppressive sociopolitical structure in which they exist.&lt;ref name = sloan /&gt; The central concepts of liberation psychology include: conscientization; realismo-crítico; de-ideologized reality; a coherently social orientation; the preferential option for the oppressed majorities, and methodological eclecticism.&lt;ref name = russell /&gt;&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;

== History ==

=== Emergence ===
The core ideas of liberation psychology emerged in [[Latin America]] in the 1970s in response to criticisms of traditional psychology, [[social psychology]] specifically. Psychology was criticised for its 1) value neutrality; 2) assertion of universality; 3) societal irrelevance.

# View of science as neutral – The idea that science was devoid of moral elements was considered a flawed framework.
# Assertion of universality – Psychological theories were being produced based on research conducted primarily with white, middle class, undergraduate males. Liberationists questioned the notion that such principles were universal and therefore applicable to all individuals without regard to the consideration of contextual factors.
# Societal irrelevance – Psychology was viewed as failing to generate knowledge that could address social inequalities.

In response to these criticisms, psychologists sought to create a psychological science that addressed social inequalities both in theory and practical application. It is important to note that liberation psychology is not an area of psychology akin to clinical, developmental, or social psychology. However, it is more of a framework that aims to reconstruct psychology taking into account the perspective of the oppressed (Martín-Baró's "new interlocutor") so the discipline ceases its (often unwitting) complicity with the structures that perpetuate domination, oppression and inequality. Generally, people using this framework would not call themselves "liberation psychologists", although this term is sometimes used to refer to them.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;

The term "liberation psychology" (or ''psicología de la liberación'') may have first appeared in print in 1976. It was later brought into widespread use by [[Ignacio Martín-Baró]]. A number of other Latin American social psychologists have also developed and promoted the approach, including Martiza Montero (Venezuela), Ignacio Dobles (Costa Rica), Bernardo Jiménez Dominguez (Colombia/Mexico), Jorge Mario Flores (Mexico), Edgar Barrero (Colombia) and Raquel Guzzo (Brazil) among others.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;

=== Founder ===
The genesis of liberation psychology began amongst a body of psychologists in [[Latin America]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt; [[Ignacio Martín-Baró]] is credited as the founder of liberation psychology, and it was further developed by others.&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;

Martín-Baró was a Spanish-born Jesuit priest and social psychologist who dedicated his work to addressing the needs of oppressed groups in Latin America, and ultimately was assassinated as a result of his work.&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;&lt;ref name = aalbers /&gt; His project of constructing a psychology relevant to the oppressed majorities of the American continent was therefore terminated prematurely. The collection of some of his articles in the collection ''Writings for a Liberation Psychology''&lt;ref&gt;Aron, A., &amp; Corne, S. (Eds.). (1996). Ignacio Martín-Baró: Writings for a Liberation Psychology. New York: Harvard University Press, Aron, A.&lt;/ref&gt; is a seminal text in the field that discusses the role of psychology as socially transformative.&lt;ref name = sloan /&gt;&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt; Most of his work still remains untranslated into English. His two major textbooks, ''Social Psychology from Central America'',&lt;ref&gt;Martín-Baró, I. (1983). Acción e Ideología: Psicología social desde Centroamérica I. San Salvador: UCA Editores.; Martín-Baró, I. (1989). Sistema, Grupo y Poder: Psicología social desde Centroamérica II. San Salvador: UCA Editores.&lt;/ref&gt; and his other books&lt;ref&gt;Martín-Baró, I. (1989). La opinión pública salvadoreña (1987-1988). San Salvador: UCA Editores; Martín-Baró, I. (2000). Psicología social de la guerra: trauma y terapia. San Salvador: UCA Editores.&lt;/ref&gt; are published by a small University publisher, UCA editores in El Salvador with the consequence that the breadth and depth of his work is not well known even in Latin America.

== Key concepts ==
The central concepts of liberation psychology include: ''concientización''; ''realismo-crítico''; de-ideologization; a social orientation; the preferential option for the oppressed majorities, and methodological eclecticism.&lt;ref name = russell /&gt;&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;

=== ''Concientización'' ===
The intrinsic connectedness of the person's experience and the sociopolitical structure is a fundamental tenet of liberation psychology and is referred to as ''concientización'', a term introduced by the Brazilian educator [[Paulo Freire]], roughly translatable as the raising of politico-social consciousness. In this process people become more conscious of themselves and their lives as structured by the social reality of oppression, understood structurally, and they thereby become social actors. They change as they begin to act on their social circumstances. Understanding this interconnectedness is of particular importance to understanding the experiences and psychology of oppressed peoples, the power structure to which they are subjugated, and the ways in which this subjugation manifests in their behavior and psychopathology.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = aalbers /&gt;

=== A social orientation ===
Liberation psychology criticises traditional psychology for explaining human behavior independently of the sociopolitical, historical, and cultural context.&lt;ref name = sloan /&gt;&lt;ref name = russell /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt; Martín-Baró argued that a failure of mainstream psychology is the attribution to the individual of characteristics that are found in the societal relations of the group. He argued that individual characteristics are a result of social relations, and to view such individualistically de-emphasizes the role of social structures, incorrectly attributing sociopolitical problems to the individual.&lt;ref name = russell /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt; Liberation psychology addresses this by reorienting the focus from an individualistic to a social orientation. Using this framework, the behaviour of oppressed people is conceptualized not through intrapsychic processes, but as a result of the alienating environment. 

The social orientation has a particular emphasis on understanding the role of history in shaping current conditions, and the ways in which this history resulted in the oppression of particular communities. Within this orientation, critical examination of social power and its structures is crucial. This is necessary in order to understand political and social power as not being interpersonal, but part of a society's institutional organization.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;

=== Preferential option for the oppressed majorities ===
The development of a psychology that is "from" oppressed people rather than "for" oppressed people is the aim of liberation psychologists. Traditional psychology is understood as Eurocentric and is critiqued for ignoring the unique experiences of oppressed individuals. Martín-Baró made a similar argument, critiquing Latin American psychologists for adopting Eurocentric psychological models that were not informed by the social, political, and cultural environment of the impoverished and oppressed, which was the majority of people in 1980s El Salvador.&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;&lt;ref name = aalbers /&gt;

Liberation psychology further criticizes traditional psychology for its ivory tower approach to understanding phenomena, following Martín-Baró's call for psychology to turn its attention from its own social and scientific status to the needs and struggles of the popular majority. Unlike traditional approaches, liberation psychology seeks to re-situate the psychologist as part of the emancipatory process for and with oppressed communities.

=== ''Realismo-crítico'' ===
Martín-Baró contended that theories should not define the problems to be explored, but that the problems generate their own theories.&lt;ref name = martin /&gt; This idea is termed ''realismo-crítico''. This is contrasted to the traditional approach of addressing problems based on preconceived theorization, ''idealismo-metodológico'' (methodological idealism). In ''realismo-crítico'', theorization plays a supportive, but not fundamental, role.&lt;ref name = martin /&gt; Martín-Baró's idea of ''realism-crítico'' should not be equated with the work of [[Roy Bhaskar]] on [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]]. Although the two ideas are conceptually similar in some ways, they have distinct meanings (hence the use of the term here in Spanish, rather than attempting a direct translation).&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;

=== De-ideologized reality ===
Martín-Baró emphasized the role of ideology in obscuring the social forces and relations that create and maintain oppression: a key task of psychologists then is to de-ideologize reality, helping people to understand for themselves the nature of social reality transparently rather than obscured by dominant ideology.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt; Ideology, understood as the ideas that perpetuate the interests of hegemonic groups, maintains the unjust sociopolitical environment. Alternatively, a de-ideologized reality encourages members of marginalized populations to endorse ideologies that promote their own interests and not those of the hegemony.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;&lt;ref name = aalbers /&gt; Martín-Baró's analysis of supposed Latin American fatalism and the myth of the lazy Latino exemplified his approach as did his use of public opinion surveys to counter the distortion that the then government and military were presenting of the Salvadorian public's views on the war.

=== Methodological eclecticism ===
Research with a liberation psychology framework incorporates methodologies from diverse domains. Traditional methodologies, such as surveys and quantitative analyses, are combined with more novel techniques for psychology, such as qualitative analyses, photography, drama, and textual analysis.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;

== Applications ==

===Community psychology===
{{Main|Community psychology}}
Ignacio Martín-Baró had opposed the introduction of community psychology to El Salvador, on the basis of the ameliorative (''asistencialista''') approach and limited social perspective of then dominant North American models. Nevertheless, community psychology, and especially the Latin American variants (typically termed community ''social'' psychology) is one of the areas most influenced by the concepts of liberation psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, M., &amp; Kagan, C. (2005). Liberation Social Psychology: Learning From Latin America. Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology, 15(1), 63–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, community social psychology in Latin America, which predates liberation psychology,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} also shares roots in the wider movement of Latin American critical and liberatory praxis (especially [[dependency theory]], [[philosophy of liberation]], [[liberation theology]], [[Critical pedagogy|critical or popular pedagogy]])&lt;ref&gt;Montero, M., Sonn, C., &amp; Burton, M. (2016). Community Psychology and Liberation Psychology: Creative Synergy for Ethical and Transformative Praxis. In M. A. Bond, I. García de Serrano, &amp; C. Keys (Eds.), APA handbook of community psychology (First Edition, Vol. 1). Washington, D.C: American Psychological Association.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Psychotherapeutic applications ===
{{See also|Psychotherapy}}
Liberation psychology departs from traditional psychological prioritization of the individual and the attribution of an individual's distress to pathology within the individual. Liberation psychology seeks to understand the person within their sociopolitical, cultural, and historical context. Therefore, distress is understood not solely in intrapsychic terms but in the context of an oppressive environment that psychologises and individualises distress.
In a psychotherapeutic context, this removes the onus of psychological distress solely from the individual and their immediate circumstances, and reframes the origin of distress as the environment and social structure to which persons are subjugated. Furthermore, this helps people to understand their relationship to the power structure, and the ways in which they participate in it.&lt;ref name = russell /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afuape, T. 2011"&gt;Afuape, T.

Gender and colonialism: a psychological analysis of oppression and liberation. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; In liberatory approaches to mental distress the therapy is only a step towards the 're-insertion' of a person into their social milieu, social action and their existential life-project.&lt;ref&gt;Lira, E., &amp; Weinstein, E. (2000). La tortura. Conceptualización psicológica y proceso terapéutico. In I. Martín-Baró (Ed.), Psicología social de la guerra. San Salvador: UCA Editores.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moving liberation psychology forward ==
Since the late 1990s, international congresses on liberation psychology have been held, primarily at Latin American universities. These congresses have been attended by hundreds of professionals and students, and have been crucial in perpetuating the social justice message of liberation psychology.

Specific congress themes include human rights, social justice, democratization, and creating models for liberation psychology in psychological practice and pedagogy.&lt;ref name = sloan /&gt; In recent years, these meetings have become increasingly focused on addressing issues related to poverty and economic inequality.

International congresses on liberation psychology include:

Liberation psychology is not limited to Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Burton, ¿Existe la psicología de la liberación fuera de América latina? https://www.academia.edu/2122428/_Existe_la_psicologia_de_la_liberacion_fuera_de_America_latina&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used by Philippine psychologist Virgilio Enríquez, apparently independently of Martín-Baró.&lt;ref&gt;Enriquez, V. (1994). From colonial to liberation psychology: the Philippine Experience. Manila: De La Salle University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere there have been explicit attempts to apply the approach to practice in other regions.&lt;ref&gt;Montero, M., &amp; Sonn, C. (2009). The Psychology of Liberation. Theory and Application. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 an English language liberation psychology network was established by the British psychologist Mark Burton.&lt;ref&gt;http://libpsy.org&lt;/ref&gt; It has an international membership which reflects interest in liberation psychology from psychologists who do not read Spanish or Portuguese.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Moreover, not all liberatory praxis in psychology goes under the name "liberation psychology".

== Examples ==
More examples needed.
=== Black psychology ===

{{Main|Black psychology}}
Some scholars{{who|date=May 2018}} argue that the liberation psychology framework is central to [[black psychology]]. The interconnectedness of the personal and political, a fundamental tenet of liberation psychology, is central to black psychology. Furthermore, black psychology is thought of as inherently liberationist as it argues that addressing the psychology of black persons necessitates understanding, and addressing, the history and sociopolitical power structure that has resulted in the global oppression of individuals of African descent.&lt;ref name = azibo /&gt; 

Proponents of black psychology operate within the social orientation of liberation psychology, contending that Eurocentric ideologies of traditional psychology lack relevance when dealing with black communities. Therefore, an Afrocentric conceptualization that recognizes the unique history of individuals of African-descent is necessary when dealing with such communities. Using a liberation psychology framework, black psychology argues that simply recognizing the distinctiveness of the black experience is inadequate if the psychological theorization used does not come from the communities to which they are applied.&lt;ref name="Afuape, T. 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name = azibo /&gt; Such a position is consistent with Martín-Baró's assertion that the use of Eurocentric psychological methods is incongruent with the lived experiences of oppressed communities.&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;

=== Liberation psychology and LGBT psychotherapy ===
{{Main|LGBTQ psychology}}
Recent work in North America has sought to understand the applied use of liberation psychology in psychotherapy with [[LGBT]] individuals. Unlike traditional psychotherapeutic interventions, this approach reframes LGBT individuals' psychological issues as resulting from an understandable incorporation of the [[Homonegativity|homonegative]] attitudes characteristic of the social structures within which gay and transgender people live.

Traditional psychotherapy typically recognises the effect of homophobia and its impact on LGBT people, but often fails to clear the person of the blame for embracing such views. However, a liberationist psychological approach aims to facilitate the freeing the individual of the blame for adopting the homonegative views of the society. Instead, the onus is on the social environment, understanding that persons are themselves constituted as persons in their social context. Such an approach understands 'psychological' issues as inextricably linked to the societal context.

This may free the LGBT person from feeling flawed for harboring homonegative ideas. They are then able to examine how they are a participant in the social environment and the ways in which they can take responsibility for future actions. Additionally, using the concept of ''concientización'', people can examine how changing themselves can challenge the oppressive nature of the larger sociopolitical system,&lt;ref name = russell /&gt; although in most liberation psychology there is a more dialectical relationship between personal and social change where personal change does not have to precede social liberation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Last winter I made several attempts to model the surface which he suggests, in which the three coordinates are volume, entropy and energy. The numerical data about entropy can only be obtained by integration from data which are for most bodies very insufficient, and besides it would require a very unwieldy model to get all the features, say of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, well represented, so I made no attempt at accuracy, but modelled a fictitious substance, in which the volume is greater when solid than when liquid; and in which, as in water, the saturated vapour becomes superheated by compression. When I had at last got a plaster cast I drew on it lines of equal pressure and temperature, so as to get a rough motion of their forms.

(letter to [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], 8 July, 1875)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of the model ==
Gibbs' papers defined what Gibbs called the "thermodynamic surface," which expressed the relationship between the volume, entropy, and energy of a substance at different temperatures and pressures. However, Gibbs did not include any diagrams of this surface.&lt;ref name="siggraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iowa"&gt;[http://www.eng.iastate.edu/coe/feature/jolls.asp Iowa State Chemical Engineer Drives Issue of New Stamp Honoring Father of Thermodynamics: Iowa State University – College of Engineering, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030193200/http://www.eng.iastate.edu/coe/feature/jolls.asp |date=2012-10-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving reprints of Gibbs' papers, Maxwell recognized the insight afforded by Gibbs' new point of view and set about constructing physical three-dimensional models of the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Garber, Brush, and Everitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hA-oIDR0eXkC&amp;pg=PA49 p. 49].&lt;/ref&gt; This reflected Maxwell's talent as a strong visual thinker&lt;ref&gt;Ken Brodlie, "Scientific visualization — past, present and future," Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Neutron Scattering Data Analysis, ''Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment'', Volume 354, Issue 1, 15 January 1995, Pages 104-111, {{doi|10.1016/0168-9002(94)01031-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and prefigured modern [[scientific visualization]] techniques.&lt;ref name="siggraph"/&gt;

Maxwell sculpted the original model in clay and made three [[plaster cast]]s of the clay model, sending one to Gibbs as a gift, keeping the other two in his laboratory at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name="siggraph"/&gt; Maxwell's copy is on display at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] of Cambridge University,&lt;ref name="siggraph"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Museum at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]: [http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/museum/area1/cabinet1.htm Maxwell's Apparatus].&lt;/ref&gt; while Gibbs' copy is on display at the Sloane Physics Laboratory of [[Yale University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kenneth R. Jolls |chapter=Gibbs and the art of thermodynamics |title=Proceedings of the Gibbs Symposium, Yale University, May 15–17, 1989 |page=321 |editor=D. G. Caldi |editor2=George D. Mostow |publisher= American Mathematical Society |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-8218-0157-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Gibbs held a professorship. A number of historic photographs were taken of these plaster casts during the middle of the twentieth century – including one by James Pickands II, published in 1942&lt;ref name="Rukeyser"/&gt; – and these photographs exposed a wider range of people to Maxwell's visualization approach.

== Uses of the model ==
[[File:Maxwell's letters plate IV.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maxwell's sketch of the isothermals and isopiestics on his surface (Plate IV of his collected letters).]]

Maxwell drew lines of equal pressure (isopiestics) and of equal temperature (isothermals) on his plaster cast by placing it in the sunlight, and "tracing the curve when the rays just grazed the surface."&lt;ref name="onheat"/&gt; He sent sketches of these lines to a number of colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Garber, Brush, and Everitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hA-oIDR0eXkC&amp;pg=PA50 pp. 50].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, his letter to [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]] of 15 July 1875 included sketches of these lines.&lt;ref name="onheat"/&gt; Maxwell provided a more detailed explanation and a clearer drawing of the lines in the revised version of his book ''Theory of Heat'',&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell]], ''[https://archive.org/details/theoryofheat00maxwrich Theory of Heat]'', revised in 1891 by [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh]]: the drawing of the lines appears as Figure 26d on page 207.&lt;/ref&gt; and a version of this drawing appeared on a 2005 US postage stamp in honour of Gibbs.&lt;ref name="Iowa"/&gt;

As well as being on display in two countries, Maxwell's model lives on in the literature of thermodynamics, and books on the subject often mention it,&lt;ref name="mt"&gt;See, for example, Don S. Lemons, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WFZf2G80tNcC&amp;pg=PA146 Mere Thermodynamics]'', Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-8018-9015-2}}, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; though not always with complete historical accuracy. For example, the thermodynamic surface represented by the sculpture is often reported to be that of water,&lt;ref name="mt"/&gt; contrary to Maxwell's own statement.&lt;ref name="onheat"/&gt;

== Related models ==
Maxwell's model was not the first plaster model of a thermodynamic surface: in 1871, even before Gibbs' papers, [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] had constructed a plaster [[pressure]]-[[volume]]-[[temperature]] plot, based on data for [[carbon dioxide]] collected by [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anneke Levelt Sengers|Johanna Levelt Sengers]], ''[http://www.knaw.nl/waals/pdf/fluids_complete.pdf How Fluids Unmix: Discoveries by the School of Van der Waals and Kamerlingh Onnes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530063315/http://www.knaw.nl/waals/pdf/fluids_complete.pdf |date=2007-05-30 }}'', [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]], 2002, pp. 56 &amp; 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1900, the Dutch scientist [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], together with his student [[Johannes Petrus Kuenen]] and his assistant Zaalberg van Zelst, continued Maxwell's work by constructing their own plaster thermodynamic surface models.&lt;ref name="knaw"&gt;See the page [http://www.knaw.nl/waals/experiments_kamerlingh.html 3D-Models/Mixtures/Experiments: Kamerlingh Onnes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041210065914/http://www.knaw.nl/waals/experiments_kamerlingh.html |date=2004-12-10 }} from the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. Some of these models are on display at the [[Museum Boerhaave]]: [http://www.museumboerhaave.nl/AAcollection/english/M21V01.html Room 21] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607145133/http://www.museumboerhaave.nl/AAcollection/english/M21V01.html |date=2011-06-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; These models were based on accurate experimental data obtained in their laboratory, and were accompanied by specialised tools for drawing the lines of equal pressure.&lt;ref name="knaw"/&gt;

'''Mobile phone tracking''' is the ascertaining of the position or location of a [[mobile phone]], whether stationary or moving. Localization may occur either via [[multilateration]] of radio signals between (several) [[cell tower]]s of the [[cellular network|network]] and the phone, or simply via [[GPS]]. To locate a mobile phone using multilateration of radio signals, it must emit at least the [[roaming]] signal to contact the next nearby antenna tower, but the process does not require an active call. The [[GSM|Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM) is based on the phone's [[signal strength]] to nearby antenna masts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4738219.stm|title=Tracking a suspect by any mobile phone: Tracking SIM and handset | work=BBC News | date=2005-08-03 | accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile positioning may include [[location-based service]]s that disclose the actual coordinates of a mobile phone, which is a technology used by [[telecommunication]] companies to [[approximate]] the location of a mobile phone, and thereby also its user.&lt;ref name=swang2008&gt;[http://to.swang.googlepages.com/ICC2008LBSforMobilessimplifiedR2.pdf "Location Based Services for Mobiles: Technologies and Standards“], Shu Wang, Jungwon Min and Byung K. Yi, [http://www.ieee-icc.org/ IEEE International Conference on Communication (ICC) 2008], Beijing, China&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
The technology of locating is based on measuring power levels and [[antenna pattern]]s and uses the concept that a powered mobile phone always communicates [[wireless]]ly with one of the closest [[base station]]s, so knowledge of the location of the base station implies the cell phone is nearby.

Advanced systems determine the sector in which the mobile phone is located and roughly estimate also the distance to the base station. Further approximation can be done by [[interpolating]] signals between adjacent antenna towers. Qualified services may achieve a precision of down to 50 meters in [[urban area]]s where mobile traffic and density of antenna towers (base stations) is sufficiently high.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} [[Rural]] and desolate areas may see miles between base stations and therefore determine locations less precisely.

[[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] localization uses [[multilateration]] to determine the location of GSM mobile phones, or dedicated trackers, usually with the intent to locate the user.&lt;ref name=swang2008 /&gt;

The location of a mobile phone can be determined in a number of ways:

===Network-based===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
The location of a mobile phone can be determined using the service provider's network infrastructure. The advantage of network-based techniques, from a service provider's point of view, is that they can be implemented non-intrusively without affecting handsets. Network-based techniques were developed many years prior to the widespread availability of GPS on handsets. (See {{cite patent |country=US |number=5519760 |gdate=21 May 1996}} for one of the first works relating to this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/1-5200-RD24-Mobile-positioning-using-wireless-networks.pdf Mobile Positioning Using Wireless Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;)

The accuracy of network-based techniques varies, with cell identification as the least accurate and [[triangulation]] as moderately accurate, and newer "advanced forward link [[trilateration]]" timing methods as the most accurate. The accuracy of network-based techniques is both dependent on the concentration of cell base stations, with urban environments achieving the highest possible accuracy because of the higher number of [[cell tower]]s, and the implementation of the most current timing methods.

One of the key challenges of network-based techniques is the requirement to work closely with the service provider, as it entails the installation of hardware and software within the operator's infrastructure. Frequently the compulsion associated with a legislative framework, such as [[Enhanced 9-1-1]], is required before a service provider will deploy a solution.

===Handset-based===
The location of a mobile phone can be determined using [[client software]] installed on the handset.&lt;ref&gt;Handset-based mobile phone tracking app example 1: [http://www.crystalball.tv/mobile-phone-tracking/ MobileTrack]&lt;/ref&gt; This technique determines the location of the handset by putting its location by cell identification, signal strengths of the home and neighboring cells, which is continuously sent to the carrier. In addition, if the handset is also equipped with [[GPS]] then significantly more precise location information can be then sent from the handset to the carrier.

Another approach is to use a fingerprinting-based technique,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=M.|last2=Youssef|first2=M.|date=2012-01-01|title=CellSense: An Accurate Energy-Efficient GSM Positioning System|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6062428|journal=IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology|volume=61|issue=1|pages=286–296|doi=10.1109/TVT.2011.2173771|issn=0018-9545|arxiv=1110.3425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=M.|last2=Youssef|first2=M.|date=2010-12-01|title=CellSense: A Probabilistic RSSI-Based GSM Positioning System|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5683779|journal=2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2010)|pages=1–5|doi=10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683779|arxiv=1004.3178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=M.|last2=Youssef|first2=M.|date=2011-06-01|title=A Hidden Markov Model for Localization Using Low-End GSM Cell Phones|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5962993|journal=2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)|pages=1–5|doi=10.1109/icc.2011.5962993|arxiv=1010.3411}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the "signature" of the home and neighboring cells signal strengths at different points in the area of interest is recorded by [[wardriving|war-driving]] and matched in real-time to determine the handset location. This is usually performed independent from the carrier.

The key disadvantage of handset-based techniques, from service provider's point of view, is the necessity of installing software on the handset. It requires the active cooperation of the mobile subscriber as well as software that must be able to handle the different [[operating system]]s of the handsets. Typically, [[smartphone]]s, such as one based on [[Symbian]], [[Windows Mobile]], [[Windows Phone]], [[BlackBerry OS]], [[iOS]], or [[Android (operating system)|Android]], would be able to run such software, e.g. Google Maps.

One proposed work-around is the installation of [[embedded system|embedded]] hardware or software on the handset by the manufacturers, e.g., [[Enhanced Observed Time Difference]] (E-OTD). This avenue has not made significant headway, due to the difficulty of convincing different manufacturers to cooperate on a common mechanism and to address the cost issue. Another difficulty would be to address the issue of foreign handsets that are roaming in the network.

===SIM-based===
Using the [[subscriber identity module]] (SIM) in [[GSM]] and [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS) handsets, it is possible to obtain raw radio measurements from the handset.&lt;ref&gt;ETSI TS 102 223 V9.1.0 SIM standard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.co.nz/article/484018/vodafone_local_zone_-_landline_your_mobile|title= Vodafone Local Zone|work= PC World|author=Ted Gibbons|date=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Available measurements include the serving [[Cell ID]], round-trip time, and signal strength. The type of information obtained via the SIM can differ from that which is available from the handset. For example, it may not be possible to obtain any raw measurements from the handset directly, yet still obtain measurements via the SIM.

===Wi-Fi===
[[Crowdsourcing|Crowdsourced]] Wi-Fi data can also be used to identify a handset's location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A on Location Data|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/04/27Apple-Q-A-on-Location-Data.html|work=apple.com|publisher=Apple|accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poor performance of the GPS-based methods in indoor environment and the increasing popularity of Wi-Fi have encouraged companies to design new and feasible methods to carry out Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | journal=Asilomar Conference on Signal Processing 2012|url=http://ws2.binghamton.edu/fowler/Improving%20WLAN-Based%20Indoor%20Mobile%20Positioning%20Using%20Sparsity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[smartphone]]s combine [[satellite navigation|Global Navigation Satellite System]]s (GNSS), such as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[GLONASS]], with [[Wi-Fi positioning system]]s.

=== Hybrid ===
[[Hybrid positioning system]]s use a combination of network-based and handset-based technologies for location determination. One example would be some modes of [[Assisted GPS]], which can both use [[GPS]] and network information to compute the location. Both types of data are thus used by the telephone to make the location more accurate (i.e., A-GPS). Alternatively tracking with both systems can also occur by having the phone attain its GPS-location directly from the [[satellite]]s, and then having the information sent via the network to the person that is trying to locate the telephone. Such systems include [[Google Maps]], as well as, [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]'s [[OTDOA]] and [[E-CellID]].

There are also hybrid positioning systems which combine several different location approaches to position mobile devices by [[Wi-Fi]], [[WiMAX]], GSM, LTE, [[IP address]]es, and network environment data.

== Operational purpose ==
In order to route calls to a phone, the [[cell site|cell towers]] listen for a signal sent from the phone and negotiate which tower is best able to communicate with the phone. As the phone changes location, the antenna towers monitor the signal, and the phone is "roamed" to an adjacent tower as appropriate. By comparing the relative signal strength from multiple antenna towers, a general location of a phone can be roughly determined. Other means make use of the antenna pattern, which supports angular determination and [[phase discrimination]].

Newer phones may also allow the tracking of the phone even when turned on and not active in a telephone call. This results from the roaming procedures that perform hand-over of the phone from one base station to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bearer interest ==
A phone's location can be uploaded to a common website where one's friends and family can view one's last reported position. Newer phones may have built-in [[Global Positioning System|GPS receivers]] which could be used in a similar fashion, but with much higher accuracy. This is controversial, because data on a common website means people who are not "friends and family" may be able to view the information.

== Privacy ==
Locating or positioning touches upon delicate [[privacy]] issues, since it enables someone to check where a person is without the person's consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Waxman |first1=Seth |title=Brief for technology companies as amici curiae in support of neither party |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/16-402-ac-technology-companies.pdf |website=scotusblog |publisher=Supreme Court of the United States |accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strict ethics and security measures are strongly recommended for services that employ positioning.&lt;br/&gt;

He described the data, which consists of 35,830 lines of data collected during the span of [[Germany]]'s [[data retention]] at the time, saying, "This is six months of my life [...] You can see where I am, when I sleep at night, what I'm doing." He partnered up with [[Die Zeit|ZEIT Online]] and made his information publicly available in an [http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-vorratsdaten interactive map] which allows users to watch his entire movements during that time in fast-forward.

In November 2017, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Carpenter v. United States]]'' that the government violates the Fourth Amendment by accessing historical records containing the physical locations of cellphones without a search warrant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12531">'''Narcissistic rage''' is a reaction to '''narcissistic injury''', which is a perceived threat to a [[narcissist|narcissist's]] [[self-esteem]] or self-worth.  ''Narcissistic injury'' (or ''narcissistic scar'') is a phrase used by [[Sigmund Freud]] in the 1920s; ''narcissistic wound'' and ''narcissistic blow'' are further, almost interchangeable terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London 2009) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''narcissistic rage'' was coined by [[Heinz Kohut]] in 1972.

Narcissistic injury occurs when a narcissist feels that their hidden, "true self" has been revealed. This may be the case when the narcissist experiences a "fall from grace", such as when their hidden behaviors or motivations are revealed, or when their importance is [[Egotism|brought into question]]. Narcissistic injury is a cause of distress and can lead to [[Emotional dysregulation|dysregulation]] of behaviors as in narcissistic rage.

Narcissistic rage occurs on a continuum, which may range from instances of aloofness and expressions of mild irritation or annoyance to serious outbursts, including [[Violence|violent attacks]] and [[murder]].&lt;ref name="isbn1-58562-204-4"/&gt;  Narcissistic rage reactions are not limited to [[personality disorders]] and may be also seen in [[catatonic]], [[paranoid delusion]] and depressive episodes.&lt;ref name="isbn1-58562-204-4"&gt;{{cite book |author= Carl P. Malmquist|title=Homicide: A Psychiatric Perspective |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc |location= |year=2006 |pages=181–82  |isbn=1-58562-204-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that narcissists have two layers of rage. The first layer of rage can be thought of as a constant anger (towards someone else), with the second layer being a [[Self-hatred|self-aimed wrath]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Vaknin|Vaknin, Sam]], ''Malignant Self Love: Narcissism Revisited'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud and narcissist blows==

In his 1914 case study of the "[[The Wolfman (Freud essay)|Wolfman]]", Freud identified the cause of the latter's adult [[neurosis]] as the moment when "he was forced to realise that his gonorrheal infection constituted a serious injury to his body. The blow to his narcissism was too much for him and he went to pieces".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (P. F. L. 9) p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;  A few years later, in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', looking at the inevitable setbacks of childhood sexuality, Freud maintained that "loss of love and failure leave behind them a permanent injury to self-regard in the form of a narcissistic scar... [[Human self-reflection|reflecting]] the full extent to which he has been 'scorned'".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (P. F. L. 11) p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further psychoanalytic developments==

Freud's concept of what in his very last book he called "early injuries to the self (injuries to narcissism)"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Moses and Monotheism'' (Letchworth 1939) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; was  subsequently extended by a wide variety of psychoanalysts. [[Karl Abraham]] saw the key to adult depressions in the childhood experience of a blow to narcissism through the loss of [[narcissistic supply]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Fenichel]] confirmed the importance of narcissistic injury in depressives&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded such analyses to include [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline personalities]].&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edmund Bergler]] emphasized the importance of infantile [[megalomania|omnipotence]] in narcissism,&lt;ref&gt;Arnold M. Cooper, in Arnold M. Cooper ed., ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis in America'' (2006) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; and the rage that follows any blow to that sense of narcissistic omnipotence;&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Bergler, in Jon Halliday/Peter Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) pp. 176, 182&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annie Reich]] stressed how a feeling of shame fuelled rage, when a blow to narcissism exposed the gap between one's ego ideal and mundane reality;&lt;ref&gt;Mark O'Connell, ''John Banville's Narcissistic Fictions'' (2013) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanians]] linked Freud on the narcissistic wound to Lacan on the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|narcissistic mirror stage]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Murray/Alan K. Smith, ''Repossessions'' (1998) p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally [[object relations theory]] highlights rage against early environmental failures that left patients feeling bad about themselves when childhood omnipotence was too abruptly challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1996) pp. 86, 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kohut and self psychology==

Heinz Kohut explored a wide range of rage experiences in his seminal article "Thoughts on Narcissism and Narcissistic Rage" (1972).&lt;ref&gt;Paul H. Ornstein, in Cooper ed., p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; He considered narcissistic rage as one major form among many, contrasting it especially with mature [[Aggressiveness|aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornstein, in Cooper ed., pp. 451–52&lt;/ref&gt; Because the very structure of the self itself is weakened in the narcissist, their rage cannot flower into real [[assertiveness]];&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, "Introduction", Cooper, ed., p. xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; and they are left instead prone to oversensitivity to perceived or imagined narcissistic injuries resulting in narcissistic rage.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Carlson/Len Sperry, ''The Disordered Couple'' (1998) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

For Kohut, narcissistic rage is related to narcissists' need for total [[Control freak|control]] of their environment, including "the need for revenge, for righting a wrong, for undoing a hurt by whatever means".&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-514873-8"/&gt; It is an attempt by the narcissist to turn from a passive sense of [[victimization]] to an active role in giving pain to others, while at the same time attempting to rebuild their own (actually false) sense of self-worth. It may also involve self-protection and preservation, with rage serving to restore a sense of safety and power by destroying that which had threatened the narcissist.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-514873-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ronningstam, Elsa |title=Identifying and understanding the narcissistic personality |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2005 |pages=86–87 |isbn=0-19-514873-8 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veX1zqgXSmkC&amp;pg=PA86 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, according to Kohut, rages can be seen as a result of the [[shame]] at being faced with failure.&lt;ref name = "kohut"&gt;{{cite book|last = Kohut | first = Heinz  |authorlink = |coauthors = |title = Thoughts on narcissism and narcissistic rage. In The search for the self |publisher = International Universities Press  | year = 1972  | location =   | pages =  615–58  | url =   | doi =   | id = Vol. 2  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Narcissistic rage is the uncontrollable and unexpected anger that results from a narcissistic injury – a threat to a narcissist's [[self-esteem]] or worth. Rage comes in many forms, but all pertain to the same important thing: [[revenge]]. Narcissistic rages are based on fear and will endure even after the threat is gone.&lt;ref name="Golomb1992"&gt;{{cite book |last=Golomb |first=Elan |title=Trapped in the Mirror: Adult Children of Narcissists in their Struggle for Self |publisher=Harper Collins |year=1992 |location=New York |isbn=0-688-14071-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the narcissist, the rage is directed towards the person that they feel has slighted them; to other people, the rage is incoherent and unjust. This rage [[cognitive distortion|impairs their cognition]], therefore impairing their [[judgment]].  During the rage they are prone to shouting, fact distortion and making [[False accusations|groundless accusations]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, David (2010). Narcissism: Behind the Mask&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Analysis of the Self'', Kohut explains that expressions caused by a sense of things not going the expected way blossom into rages, and narcissists may even search for conflict to find a way to alleviate their pain or suffering.&lt;ref name = "kohut71"&gt;{{cite book|last = Kohut | first = Heinz  | authorlink =   | coauthors = | title = The analysis of the self: A systematic approach to the psychoanalytic treatment of narcissistic personality disorders. | publisher = Perspectives |year = 1971 |location = |pages = |url = |doi =  |id = |isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perfectionism==

Narcissists are often [[perfectionism (psychology)|pseudo-perfectionists]] and create situations in which they are  the center of attention.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The narcissist's attempts at being seen as perfect are necessary for their grandiose [[self-image]]. If a perceived state of perfection is not reached, it can lead to [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[anger]] or [[anxiety]] because the subject believes that they will lose the admiration and love from other people if they are imperfect.&lt;ref name="Sorotzkin2005"&gt;{{cite web|last =Sorotzkin|first =Benzion|authorlink =|coauthors =|title =The Quest for Perfection: Avoiding Guilt or avoiding shame?|publisher =Psychology Today|date =18 Apr 2006|location =|pages =|url =http://www.drsorotzkin.com/quest_for_perfection.html|doi =|id =|isbn =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080309214032/http://www.drsorotzkin.com/quest_for_perfection.html|archivedate =2008-03-09|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind such  perfectionism, [[self psychology]] would see earlier traumatic injuries to the [[Grandiosity|grandiose self]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold M. Cooper, "Introduction"  in Arnold M. Cooper ed., ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis in America'' (2006) p. xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

==In therapy==

[[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]] has argued that, contrary to what common sense might expect, therapeutic cure involves the patient being encouraged to re-experience "a terrible narcissistic wound" – the child's experience of exclusion by the parental alliance – in order to come to terms with, and learn again, the diminishing loss of omnipotence entailed by the basic "facts of life".&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''The Beast in the Nursery'' (1998) pp. 99–110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Wide dissemination of Kohut's concepts may at times have led to their trivialization. [[Neville Symington]] points out that "You will often hear people say, 'Oh, I'm very narcissistic,' or, 'It was a wound to my narcissism.' Such comments are not a true recognition of the condition; they are throw-away lines. Really to recognise narcissism in oneself is profoundly distressing and often associated with denial."&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==

The lead character of ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' has been considered as exhibiting narcissistic rage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burgo|first=Joseph|title=Narcissistic Rage and the Failure of Empathy: 'Citizen Kane'|url=http://www.afterpsychotherapy.com/citizen-kane/|publisher=After Psychotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Jnana Yoga]] '''Nididhyasana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: निदिध्यासन) is profound and repeated meditation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spokensanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=nididhyAsana&amp;link=m}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[mahavakyas]], great Upanishadic statements such as "That art Thou", to realize the identity of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]]. It is the fourth step in the training of a [[Guru-shishya tradition|sisya]] (disciple), consisting of preparatory practives, listening to the teachings as contained in the [[sruti]], [[Manana (reflection)|reflection]] on the teachings, and nididhyasana.

==Four stages of practice==
Nididhyasana is the final step in the correct understanding of the meaning of the [[Mahavakyas]]. Classical [[Advaita Vedanta]] emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga, a progression of study and training to attain [[moksha]]. It consists of four stages:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=251-254}}&lt;ref group=web name=AdvaitaYogaAshrama /&gt;
* '''Samanyasa''' or ''Sampatti''s,&lt;ref&gt;Adi Shankara, ''Tattva bodha'' (1.2)&lt;/ref&gt; the "fourfold discipline" (''sādhana-catustaya''), cultivating the following four qualities:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=251-254}}&lt;ref group=web name=AdvaitaYogaAshrama&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yoga108.org/pages/show/55 |title=Advaita Yoga Ashrama, '&amp;#39;Jnana Yoga.

*** ''Dama'' (the control of external sense organs).
*** ''[[Uparati]]'' (the cessation of these external organs so restrained, from the pursuit of objects other than that, or it may mean the abandonment of the prescribed works according to scriptural injunctions).{{refn|group=note|''nivartitānāmeteṣāṁ tadvyatiriktaviṣayebhya uparamaṇamuparatirathavā vihitānāṁ karmaṇāṁ vidhinā parityāgaḥ''[Vedāntasāra, 21]}}

** '''''{{IAST|Mumukṣutva}}''''' (मुमुक्षुत्वम्) — The firm conviction that the nature of the world is misery and the intense longing for ''moksha'' (''release from the cycle of births and deaths'').
* '''Sravana''', listening to the teachings of the sages on the [[Upanishads]] and Advaita Vedanta, and studying the Vedantic texts, such as the [[Brahma Sutras]]. In this stage the student learns about the reality of [[Brahman]] and the identity of atman;
* '''Manana''', the stage of [[Manana (reflection)|reflection on the teachings]];
* '''Nididhyāsana''', the stage of meditation on the truth "that art Thou".&lt;ref group=web name=AdvaitaYogaAshrama /&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100234232 Oxford Index, ''nididhyāsana'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Nididhyasana is a rational and cognitive process, which differs from [[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]] (meditation). It is necessary for gaining ''Brahmajnana'':{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=108}}
{{quote|आत्मा ब्रह्मेति वाक्यार्थे निःशेषेण विचारिते &lt;br&gt;By a thorough analysis of "Atman is Brahman" the direct knowledge "I am Brahman" is achieved ([[Panchadasi]] VII.58).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi of Sri Vidyaranya Swami|author=Swami Swahananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|page=256|url= https://www.amazon.in/Pancadasi-Swami-Vidyaranya/dp/8171205070}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nididhyasana done independently of ''[[Listening|sravana]]'' does not lead to the realization of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upanisads, Vol.3|author=Swami Parmeshwaranand|publisher=Sarup&amp;Sons|pages=314–317|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgwzp6-HTTIC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=Nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A67UUtGiMsK4hAeXgoG4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==

===Advaita Vedanta===
[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (II.iv.5) defines Nididhyasana as the meditation for the sake of direct vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Method of the Vedanta: A Critical account of the Advaita Tradition|author=Swami Satchidanandendra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=372|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMkbWhjE2M4C&amp;pg=PA372&amp;dq=Nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A67UUtGiMsK4hAeXgoG4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Yajnavalkya]] tells his wife –

:आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यो मन्तव्यो निदिध्यासितव्यो मैत्रेयि, 
:आत्मनो व अरे दर्शनेन श्रवणेन मत्या विज्ञानेनेदं सर्वं विदितम् ||

:"The Self, my dear [[Maitreyi]], should be realized – should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon; 
:by the realization of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known." -  ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] St.II.iv.5)

[[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains Nididhyasana as meditation with determination. Sankara states:-

:श्रुतेः शतगुणं विद्यान्मननं मननादपि |
:निदिध्यासं लक्षगुणम् अनन्तं निर्विकल्पकम् ||

:"Reflection (manana) is hundred times superior to listening (sravana); 
:meditation (nididhyasana) is hundred times superior to reflection; nirvikalpaka samadhi is infinitely superior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Candrasekhara Bharati of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=365|quote=Verse 365|url= https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sri-Samkaras-Vivekacudamni-S-Bhagavatpada/dp/8172764200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Maṇḍana Miśra|Suresvara]], Nididhyasana is the culmination of the practice of ''[[Listening|sravana]]'' and ''[[manan]]a'', which is an indirect intuition of [[Brahman]] and does not mean meditation but knowledge ([[vijñāna|vijnana]]) i.e. understanding the meaning of the [[Śruti|Sruti]] on the basis of ''vacya-vacaka'' relation underlying the [[Mahāvākyas|mahavakya]]. Suresvara states:-

:शास्त्रचार्यानुभवनैर्हेतुभिश्च समर्थितः|
:ईदृगैकात्म्यसंबोधो निदिध्यासनमुच्यते ||

:"Nididhyasana is so called when, instruction about the uniqueness of the Atman is justified 
:by (proper) reasons viz. the Sruti, (the instructions of) teachers and (one’s own) experience (of the same)."

Nididhyasana consists in acquisition of ''vakyarthajnana'' and this verse explains the purport of ''sunisnata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suresvara’s vartika on Madhu Brahmana (Brhadaranyaka-Upanishad)|author=Suresvaracarya|publisher=Motilal Banarsi Dass|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9wiepM1y2EC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A67UUtGiMsK4hAeXgoG4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vacaspati]], ''sravana'', ''manana'' and ''nidihyasana'' are a chain of causes contributory to the knowledge of the oneness of Brahman. The Vivarna school considers ''sravana'' as the principal cause but Suresvara treats ''sravana'' and ''manana'' to be co-existent, these two culminate into ''nididhyasana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suresvara’s Vartika on Yajnavalkya’s Maitreyi Dialogue|author=Shoun Hino|publisher=Motilal Banarsi Dass|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvcrBnKaIgEC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=Nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A67UUtGiMsK4hAeXgoG4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dvaita Vedanta===
According to [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] the knowledge acquired by study ('sravana') and stabilized by reflection ('manana') is made the basis of steady contemplation ('nididhyasana'); these are the three stages of inquiry that take the form of ''Dhyana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Sri Madhvacarya|author=B.N.Krishnamurti Sharma|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=408|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8XVE0_TiLMC&amp;pg=PA380&amp;dq=nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9erVUvv1D6S27QbIuYCYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] has defined Nididhyasana as "the process by which intellectual conscience is transformed into a vital one there is stillness, a calm in which the soul lays itself open to the Divine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seeker’s Path|author=Sohan Singh|publisher=Orient Blackswan|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5lMmeNKn68C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=nididhyasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9erVUvv1D6S27QbIuYCYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=nididhyasana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Vedanta===
According to Michael James, who gives an Advaita Vedanta interpretation of Ramana Maharshi, Ramana's [[self-enquiry]] is the same as Nididhyasana and ''atma-vichara''.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.in/2008/06/self-enquiry-underlying-philosophy-can.html Michael James, ''Self-enquiry: the underlying philosophy can be clearly understood only by putting it into practice'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nsumi''', or "Nsumi Collective" is an art collective, initially formed as a New School student association called Nsumiscope in the fall of 2001 the week directly following September 11th.  Their projects last for years at a time, and are not always documented or publicized. 

Nsumi's work occurs mostly within the back-end of the art world where ideas wobble around before becoming embodied as art.  Members of Nsumi have claimed that the group spawns art collectives and experimental groups through a [[gift economy]] consulting project and other tactics, such as workshops, art exhibitions and performances, zines, street classes, academic research, and public interventions.  The group's changing membership has included educators, artists, scientists, architects, landscape designers, curators, collectors, and others.

Nsumi operates fluidly, frequently collaborating with artists and collectives including [[Trevor Paglen]], [[Brandon Ballengée]], [[Rainer Ganahl]], AUNTS Collective and Peter Fend, in addition to those who participate anonymously.

Their insider/outsider practice involves a range of disciplines including traditional [[art]], [[trend analysis]] and [[Network theory]], [[urban planning]] and [[Cartography|mapping]], interventions within [[ecosystems]], [[grassroots]] political organizing and [[prefigurative politics]].

Sometimes Nsumi fully or partially joins other art groups, adopting an individual or quasi-individual identity. Occasionally the group will exchange or swap members with different collectives, bring on temporary members, or work with artists who join the group for one-off events and exhibitions. Nsumi blurs its own boundaries since it is unclear which identity the group is operating through at a given moment or who exactly is involved. Nsumi operates under different monikers, such as Lightning Chasers, Black Magic Guild and Nsumi Group, and has been known to appear in the same group exhibition under multiple individual and group names.

Nsumi also appears in more conventional art exhibitions at galleries, universities and museums including the Queens Museum, Momenta Gallery, Deitch Projects and the Center for Architecture in New York City.  Their work has appeared in Satya magazine, ARTE Television and TRACKS TV in Europe, Total Theatre Magazine, The New York Times, Archinect, The Economist, the New York Sun, and Art News.

Between 2013 and 2014 Nsumi launched two projects that blur the lines between creative production and grassroots politics.  Banner Action (2013) is a performance involving protest banners, formal [[decentralization]], [[semiotics]] and [[memetics]]. Oubliettes (2014) is a project about prison abolition and the human rights crimes at the MDC federal prison in [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn]], following up on their 2005 collaboration with Trevor Paglen. The project resulted in a protest outside MDC prison on New Year's Eve, December 2014.

      <comment>Some aspects of organization studies have been added. It is important to explain the impact of these studies also on public organizations. They really need to be improved following the new organizational trends and models.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4715">'''Organization studies''' (also called '''organization science''' or '''organization theories''') is the inter-disciplinary academic field interested in a ''collective activity, and how it relates to organization, organizing, and management'' (see e.g. Tsoukas and Knudsen, 2005&lt;ref&gt;Tsoukas, H., &amp; Knudsen, C. (2005). The Oxford handbook of organization theory. Oxford Handbooks Online.&lt;/ref&gt; or Clegg et al., 2006&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, S. R., Hardy, C., Lawrence, T., &amp; Nord, W. R. (Eds.). (2006). The Sage handbook of organization studies. Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;). 
It has followed numerous 'turns' since its emergence in the 1960s: linguistic turn, spatial turn, practice turn, process turn, materiality turn, communication turn... A turn is a collective direction of research, focused on some coherent sets of concepts, theories, and ideas, which represent a point of bifurcation for the field itself. Most turns in organization studies relate to broader ones in social sciences and humanities. Researchers studying organizations and/or organizing processes have a recurring concern that those who work in organizations do not find organizational research particularly relevant. There is therefore growing interest in the impact of organization studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacIntosh|first=Robert|last2=Beech|first2=Nic|last3=Bartunek|first3=Jean|last4=Mason|first4=Katy|last5=Cooke|first5=Bill|last6=Denyer|first6=David|date=2017-01-01|title=Impact and Management Research: Exploring Relationships between Temporality, Dialogue, Reflexivity and Praxis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8551.12207/abstract|journal=British Journal of Management|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3–13|doi=10.1111/1467-8551.12207|issn=1467-8551}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Public administrations also, around the world, are adopting massively new organizational models to increase their efficiency and improve public services. The Organization Studies field is becoming more popular also because the borders between a well-defined organization and customers, citizens, businesses and professionals are more and more undefined&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casalino|first=N.|date=2014|title=Learning to Connect: a Training Model for Public Sector on Advanced E-Government Services and Inter-Organizational Cooperation|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/onlinejour/index.php/i-jac/article/view/3577|journal=International Journal of Advanced Corporate Learning (iJAC)|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=24–31|issn=1867-5565}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

With the recent historical turn, there is growing interest in historical organization studies, promising a closer union between organizational and historical research whose validity derives from historical veracity and conceptual rigor, enhancing understanding of historical, contemporary and future-directed social realities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclean|first=Mairi|last2=Harvey|first2=Charles|last3=Clegg|first3=Stewart R.|date=2016-10-01|title=Conceptualizing Historical Organization Studies|url=http://amr.aom.org/content/41/4/609|journal=Academy of Management Review|language=en|volume=41|issue=4|pages=609–632|doi=10.5465/amr.2014.0133|issn=0363-7425}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5396">'''Righteous indignation''' is typically a reactive [[emotion]] of [[anger]] over mistreatment, insult, or malice of another. It is akin to what is called the [[injustice|sense of injustice]]. In some [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrines, righteous anger is considered the only form of anger which is not sinful, e.g., when [[Jesus]] drove the [[Cleansing of the Temple|money lenders out of the temple]] ([[Gospel of Matthew]] 21).

==Elements==
{{disputed-section|date=August 2014}}
"Righteous" means acting in accord with divine or [[Moral absolutism|moral law]] or free from guilt or sin. It may also refer to a morally right or justifiable decision or action or to an action which arises from an outraged sense of justice or morality. (See third paragraph below) "Indignation" is anger aroused by something unjust, mean, or unworthy. The ''Standard Dictionary'' describes indignation as a "feeling involving anger mingled with contempt or disgust".&lt;ref name="humanele"&gt;{{cite web |author=Craig L. Adams |url=http://homepage.mac.com/craigadams1/HUMANELE/CHPTR07.html |title=Righteous Indignation |publisher=Homepage.mac.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419075734/http://homepage.mac.com/craigadams1/HUMANELE/CHPTR07.html |archivedate=2010-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament Bible commentary== 
[[Daniel Whitby]] argues that "Anger is not always sinful",&lt;ref name="criticalcommenta"&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Whitby, D.D |url=https://archive.org/stream/criticalcommenta04patr#page/212/mode/1up |title=A critical commentary and paraphrase on the Old and New Testament and the Apocrypha |publisher= www.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it is found among non-sinners. For example, Jesus was "angry with the [[Pharisees]] for the hardness of their hearts; yet He had no desire to revenge this sin upon them, but had a great compassion for them". 

==Old Testament Bible commentary== 
In [[Thomas Scott (commentator)|Scott]]'s comment on [[Ephesians]] 4:26, "Be angry, and yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger", he notes that "...on many occasions, in the management of families, in reproving sin, and even in ordering their temporal concerns", anger is permitted of Christians. Nevertheless, Scott cautions that Christians should aim to "....be very circumspect and vigilant to restrain that dangerous passion within the bounds of reason, meekness, piety, and charity; not being angry without cause, or above cause, or in a proud, selfish, and peevish manner." Scott argues that Christians should not express anger in the "language of vehement indignation".&lt;ref name="humanele" /&gt;

The ''[[Forerunner Commentary]]'' on [[Psalms]] 137:2 argues that these psalms are about the "bitterness of exile into which God forced Judah", purportedly with the goal of turning grief into zeal, so that the "anger can be used to scour away sin" by becoming "righteously indignant".&lt;ref name="forerunner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Topical.show/RTD/cgg/ID/729/Righteous-Indignation.htm |title=Righteous Indignation (Forerunner Commentary) :: Bible Tools |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228174646/http://bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Topical.show/RTD/cgg/ID/729/Righteous-Indignation.htm |archivedate=February 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Richard T. Ritenbaugh's comments on [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 15:18 in How to Survive Exile, he argues that it "is alright for us to be righteously indignant as long as we do not sin."&lt;ref name="forerunner" /&gt;  

In [[James McCosh| James McCosh's]] book ''[[Motive Powers]]'', he notes that "We may be angry and sin not; but this disposition may become sinful, and this in the highest degree. It is so when it is excessive, when it is rage, and makes us lose control of ourselves. It is so, and may become a vice, when it leads us to wish evil to those who have offended us. It is resentment when it prompts us to meet and repay evil by evil. It is vengeance when it impels us to crush those who have injured us. It is vindictiveness when it is seeking out ingeniously and laboriously means and instruments to give pain to those who have thwarted us. Already sin has entered."&lt;ref name="humanele" /&gt;

==Theological commentary==
[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], in the question on [[anger]] of his [[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]], quotes the [[Opus Imperfectum|Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum]], "he that is angry without cause, shall be in danger; but he that is angry with cause, shall not be in danger: for without anger, teaching will be useless, judgments unstable, crimes unchecked," and concludes saying that "to be angry is therefore not always an evil."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3158.htm#article1 ST]'', II-II, Q. 158, a. 1, ''sed contra''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rules of Civility &amp; Decent Behaviour In Company and Conversation'''''&lt;ref&gt;Washington, George. Rules of Civility &amp; Decent Behaviour in Company and Conversation: a Book of Etiquette. Williamsburg, VA: Beaver Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; is the name of a list best known as a school writing exercise of [[George Washington]], who became the first [[President of the United States|president]] of the [[United States of America]].  Most of the rules have been traced to a [[France|French]] [[etiquette]] manual written by [[Jesuits]] in 1595 entitled "Bienséance de la conversation entre les hommes". As a handwriting exercise in around 1744, Washington merely copied word-for-word Francis Hawkins' translation which was published in England in about 1640.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/documents/the-rules-of-civility/ Charles Moore, "Washington's Copy of Rules of Civility &amp; Decent Behaviour In Company and Conversation"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of rules opens with:

#Every Action done in Company, ought to be with Some Sign of Respect, to those that are Present.
#When in Company, put not your Hands to any Part of the Body, not usualy{{sic}} Discovered.
#Shew Nothing to your Freind that may affright him.
#In the Presence of Others Sing not to yourself with a humming Noise, nor Drum with your Fingers or Feet.
#If You Cough, Sneeze, Sigh, or Yawn, do it not Loud but Privately; and Speak not in your Yawning, but put Your handkercheif or Hand before your face and turn aside.

The exercise goes on to list a total of 110 such rules.

The list features in the plot of the [[Amor Towles]] novel ''Rules of Civility'', which is named after it.

[[File:Nagant Revolver.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A Russian [[Nagant M1895]] [[revolver]]]]
'''Russian roulette''' ({{lang-ru|русская рулетка}}, ''russkaya ruletka'') is a [[lethal]] [[game of chance]] in which a player places a single [[Cartridge (firearms)|round]] in a [[revolver]], spins the [[Cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]], places the muzzle against his or her head, and pulls the [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger]]. ''Russian'' refers to the supposed country of origin, and ''[[roulette]]'' to the element of risk-taking and the spinning of the revolver's cylinder, which is reminiscent of a spinning roulette wheel.

==Probability ==
Because only one [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] is loaded, the player has a one in ''x'' chance of being shot; ''x'' is the number of chambers in the cylinder. So, for instance, if a revolver holds six chambers, the chance is one in six. That assumes that each chamber is equally likely to come to rest in the "correct" position. However, due to gravity, in a properly maintained weapon with a single round inside the cylinder, the full chamber, which weighs more than the empty chambers, will usually end up near the bottom of the cylinder when its axis is not vertical, altering the odds in favor of the player.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} This only applies to swing-out cylinder type revolvers, and only if the cylinder is spun outside of the revolver and allowed to come to a complete stop before being locked back in.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The number of pulls of the trigger before a round is [[expected value|expected]] to discharge is 3.5 (without spinning between the pulls) or 6 (with spinning between the pulls).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statisticalideas.blogspot.com/2015/06/abnormal-risks.html|title=Abnormal risks|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In [[Mikhail Lermontov]]'s "The Fatalist" (1840), one of five novellas comprising his ''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'', a minor character places a [[flintlock]] pistol to his head, pulls the trigger and survives. However, the term ''Russian roulette'' does not appear in the story, and flintlocks do not have the necessary spinning chamber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/913/913-h/913-h.htm The Fatalist (1840)] Lermontov, Mikhail. English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=September 2018|reason="The statement itself says that the term was not used in this book. Is there any evidence that this story has any connection to the modern fad???"}}
&lt;!-- see for instance, 
   "Mikhail Yur'yevich Lermontov - A Hero of Our Time" http://community.middlebury.edu/~beyer/courses/lermontov/
   "A Hero of Our Time" http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/A_Hero_of_Our_Time
   Vladimir Golstein "Lermontov's Narratives of Heroism" page 212 https://books.google.com/books?id=Lv6TqCMhgfj8=PA212
 --&gt;

The term ''Russian roulette'' was possibly first used &lt;!-- this formerly said that RR "[originated{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} in a 1937 short story ...]";--&gt;&lt;!-- a reference to a primary source with use of the term does not support that the term "originated" in that source. The source quote merely ''uses'' the term, and does not support that it originated only in 1937. --&gt;  in a 1937 short story of the same name by [[Georges Surdez]]. However, the story describes using a gun with one empty chamber out of six, instead of five empty chambers out of six:

{{quote|'Did you ever hear of Russian Roulette?' ... with the Russian army in Romania, around 1917... some officer would suddenly pull out his revolver, anywhere, at the table, remove a cartridge from the cylinder, spin the cylinder, snap it back in place, put it to his head and pull the trigger. There were five chances to one that the hammer would set off a live cartridge and blow his brains all over the place.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Surdez, [https://monlegionnaire.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/russian-roulette.pdf "Russian Roulette,"] ''Collier's Illustrated Weekly'' 30 January 1937; "Russian roulette ''n.''", ''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Notable incidents==
* In a 1946 U.S. legal case, ''[[Commonwealth v. Malone]],'' 47 A.2d 445 (1946), a [[Pennsylvania]] teenager's conviction for murder in the second degree as a result of shooting a friend, was upheld by the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]]. In this case, the teenagers involved played a modified version of Russian roulette, called Russian poker, in which they took turns aiming and pulling the trigger of the revolver at each other, rather than at their own heads. The court ruled that "When an individual commits an act of gross recklessness without regard to the probability that death to another is likely to result, that individual exhibits the state of mind required to uphold a conviction of manslaughter even if the individual did not intend for death to ensue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/criminal-law/criminal-law-keyed-to-kadish/homicide/commonwealth-v-malone/2/ |title=Commonwealth v. Malone|work=casebriefs.com |accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has not yet been established whether simply participating in a game of Russian roulette in which another participant kills himself by his own hand would constitute manslaughter or some lesser form of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] or [[homicide]].
* ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]],'' [[Malcolm X]] recalls an incident during his burglary career when he once played Russian roulette, pulling the trigger three times in a row to convince his partners in crime that he was not afraid to die. In the epilogue to the book, [[Alex Haley]] states that Malcolm X revealed to him that he [[palming|palmed]] the round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/19/arts/design/19malccut.html|title=The Personal Evolution of a Civil Rights Giant|first=Edward|last=Rothstein|date=19 May 2005|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident is portrayed in the [[Malcolm X (1992 film)|1992 film adaptation]] of the autobiography.
* On December 25, 1954, the American [[blues]] musician [[Johnny Ace]] killed himself in [[Texas]], after a gun he pointed at his own head discharged. A report in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' attributed this to Russian roulette.&lt;ref&gt;"Really Old School", ''The Washington Post'', December 25, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Graham Greene]] relates in his first autobiography, ''[[A Sort of Life]]'' (1971), that he played Russian roulette, alone, a few times as a teenager.
* On September 10, 1976, Finnish magician [[Aimo Leikas]] killed himself in front of a crowd while performing his Russian roulette act. He had been performing the act for about a year, selecting six bullets from a box of assorted live and dummy ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.circushistory.org/Publications/CircusReport20Sep1976.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-06-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903213446/http://www.circushistory.org/Publications/CircusReport20Sep1976.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19760910&amp;id=rD0xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VgIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6876,2739715|title=Toledo Blade - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On October 12, 1984, while waiting for filming to resume on ''[[Cover Up (TV series)|Cover Up]]'' (1985), actor [[Jon-Erik Hexum]] played Russian roulette with a [[.44 Magnum]] [[revolver]] loaded with a [[Blank (cartridge)|blank]]. The gunshot fractured his skull and caused massive cerebral hemorrhaging when bone fragments were forced through his brain.

==In popular culture==
===Drinking games===
There is a [[drinking game]] based on Russian Roulette.  The game involves six shot glasses filled by a non-player.  Five are filled with water, the sixth with vodka.  Among some groups, low quality vodka is preferred as it makes the glass representing the filled chamber less desirable.  The glasses are arranged in a circle, and players take turns choosing a glass to take a shot from at random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roulettegamesvariety.com/drinking-roulette.htm|title=Drinking Roulette Fun Game|website=roulettegamesvariety.com|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a game called "Beer Hunter" (titled after the Russian Roulette scenes in the film ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''). In this game, six cans of beer are placed between the participants. One can is vigorously shaken, and the cans are scrambled. The participants take turns opening the cans of beer right under their noses; the person who opens the shaken can (and sprays beer up their nose) is deemed the loser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beer Hunter|url=http://drunkard.com/issues/01_07/md_drinking_games.html|website=Modern Drunkard Magazine|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209054418/http://drunkard.com/issues/01_07/md_drinking_games.html|archivedate=2014-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hill-Rajas allied their houses with the royal house of Kashmir through marriage. The kings of Kashmir played a correspondingly powerful role in the local politics of the Hill-Rajas. The goodwill or obedience of the Hill-Rajas must always have been a desideratum for the kings of Kashmir, in order to regulate contact between themselves and the powers of the north Indian plains.

To term it more precisely, these kingdoms was rather fortified villages of warrior—landlords known as Thakurs and Ranas.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Aśoka Jeratha|first=|title=Dogra Legends of Art &amp; Culture|year=1998 |publisher=Indus publishing company, New Delhi|ISBN= 81-7387-082-9 |p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hutchison|first=J &amp; Vogel

&lt;/ref&gt; 

These Feudal Lords were Rajputs by lineage. Most of the Rajput groups in this region originated from these kingdoms, the name of which became the name of their clan.Actually, similar for Sarmal Clan which have its origin in Sauram hills of Dugar region of Samba District of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. The family of Rajputs of Sauram Region then began to know as Sarmal who were Suryavanshi Kshatriya.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sufi |first=G. M.

==Demographics==
A majority of them are concentrated in the Samba District of the Indian-administered Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Moreover, they are also scattered in [[Jammu]], Kathua, [[Doda]], Katra, Bhadrawah and neighbouring states like [[Punjab]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]].

Scarcity can lead people to focus on enjoying an experience more deeply, which increases happiness.

Others argue self-denial involves avoidance and holding back of [[happiness]] and pleasurable experiences from oneself that is only damaging to other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethics of Interpersonal Relationships|author=Robert W.

==Religion and self-denial==
Self-denial can constitute an important element of religious practice in various belief systems. An exemplification is the self-denial advocated by several Christian confessions where it is believed to be a means of reaching happiness and a deeper religious understanding, sometimes described as 'becoming a true follower of Christ'. The foundation of self-denial in the Christian context is based the recognition of a higher God-given will, which the Christian practicer choose to adhere to, and prioritize over his or her own will or desires. This can in daily life be expressed by renunciation of certain physically pleasureable, yet from a religious stand-point inappropriate activities, sometimes referred to as 'desires of the flesh', which e.g. could entail certain sexual practices and over-indulgant eating or drinking. In the Christian faith Jesus is often mentioned as a positive example of self-denial, both in relation to the deeds performed during his life, as well as the sacrifice attributed to his death.

==Based on gender==
Self-denial in women is linked to cultural definitions of [[femininity]] which women have [[internalization|internalized]] to such an extent that self-abnegation had become basic to women's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Self Love and Christian Ethics|author=Darlene Fozard Weaver|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2002|isbn=978-0-521-52097-3|page=79|url=http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2094/lib/mccc/reader.action?docID=10070261#}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Plaskow]] observed this and argued that it was more linked to women than men because they were to follow this Christian virtue because of their detriment. Women are seen in a domestic perspective and self-denial puts all things women were once exposed to the side so they can be committed to their marriage and family. The way women are portrayed has not changed much throughout the years because the [[patriarchal]] perspective continues to be present. Through self-denial women have to sacrifice their interests and goals to satisfy not only family, but many times social norms. They are not allowed to be independent but more so are trapped to be the individual they are expected to be. However, in men, this is different.

[[Masculinity]] is linked to self-denial when put in a male perspective. Men's self-denial is both a source of men's existential alienation and part of the infrastructure of men's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recreating Sexual Politics(Routledge Revivals):Men, Feminism, and Politics|author=Victor Seidler|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|date=1991|isbn=978-0-415-57289-7|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uB-MAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=why+women+self-denial&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp-J_3qrnJAhUDOD4KHcRuCTcQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=why%20women%20self-denial&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; When men go through self-denial it is interpreted as self-improvement as put by the book ''[[Manliness (book)|Manliness]]'' in which they emphasize self-denial as a comparison to the image of the goal of Superman in "What does not kill me makes me stronger".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manliness|author=Harvey C.

However, the psychological differences between men and women are often disputed among researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender similarities in the relationship between psychological aspects of disordered eating and self-silencing|author=Locker, T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16671">In mathematics, a '''join-semilattice''' (or '''upper semilattice''') is a [[partially ordered set]] that has a [[join (mathematics)|join]] (a [[least upper bound]]) for any [[nonempty set|nonempty]] [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]]. [[Duality (order theory)|Dually]], a '''meet-semilattice''' (or '''lower semilattice''') is a partially ordered set which has a [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] (or [[greatest lower bound]]) for any nonempty finite subset. Every join-semilattice is a meet-semilattice in the [[inverse order]] and vice versa.

Semilattices can also be defined [[algebra|algebraically]]: join and meet are [[associativity|associative]], [[commutativity|commutative]], [[idempotency|idempotent]] [[binary operation]]s, and any such operation induces a partial order (and the respective inverse order) such that the result of the operation for any two elements is the least upper bound (or greatest lower bound) of the elements with respect to this partial order. 

A [[lattice (order)|lattice]] is a partially ordered set that is both a meet- and join-semilattice with respect to the same partial order. Algebraically, a lattice is a set with two associative, commutative idempotent binary operations linked by corresponding [[absorption law]]s.

{{Algebraic structures |Lattice}}

== Order-theoretic definition ==

A [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' [[partially ordered set|partially ordered]] by the [[binary relation]] ≤ is a ''meet-semilattice'' if

: For all elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''S'', the [[infimum|greatest lower bound]] of the set {{nowrap begin}}{''x'', ''y''}{{nowrap end}} exists.

The greatest lower bound of the set {{nowrap begin}}{''x'', ''y''}{{nowrap end}} is called the [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] of ''x'' and ''y'', denoted {{nowrap|''x'' ∧ ''y''}}.

Replacing "greatest lower bound" with "[[supremum|least upper bound]]" results in the dual concept of a ''join-semilattice''. The least upper bound of {''x'', ''y''} is called the [[Join (mathematics)|join]] of ''x'' and ''y'', denoted {{nowrap|''x'' ∨ ''y''}}. Meet and join are [[binary operation]]s on ''S''. A simple [[mathematical induction|induction]] argument shows that the existence of all possible pairwise suprema (infima), as per the definition, implies the existence of all non-empty finite suprema (infima).

A join-semilattice is '''bounded''' if it has a [[least element]], the join of the empty set. [[Duality (order theory)|Dually]], a meet-semilattice is '''bounded''' if it has a [[greatest element]], the meet of the empty set.

Other properties may be assumed; see the article on [[completeness (order theory)|completeness in order theory]] for more discussion on this subject. That article also discusses how we may rephrase the above definition in terms of the existence of suitable [[Galois connection]]s between related posets — an approach of special interest for [[category theory|category theoretic]] investigations of the concept.

== Algebraic definition ==
A "meet-semilattice" is an [[algebraic structure]] &lt;math&gt;\langle S, \land \rangle&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' with a [[binary operation]] ∧, called '''meet''', such that for all members ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' of ''S'', the following [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] hold:

;[[Associativity]]: ''x'' ∧ (''y'' ∧ ''z'') = (''x'' ∧ ''y'') ∧ ''z''
;[[Commutativity]]: ''x'' ∧ ''y'' = ''y'' ∧ ''x''
;[[Idempotency]]: ''x'' ∧ ''x'' = ''x''
A meet-semilattice &lt;math&gt;\langle S, \land \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is '''bounded''' if ''S'' includes an [[identity element]] 1 such that {{nowrap begin}}''x'' ∧ 1 = ''x''{{nowrap end}} for all ''x'' in ''S''. 

If the symbol ∨, called '''join''', replaces ∧ in the definition just given, the structure is called a ''join-semilattice''. One can be ambivalent about the particular choice of symbol for the operation, and speak simply of ''semilattices''.

A semilattice is a [[commutativity|commutative]], [[idempotency|idempotent]] [[semigroup]], i.e., a commutative [[band (mathematics)|band]]. A bounded semilattice is an idempotent commutative [[monoid]].

A partial order is induced on a meet-semilattice by setting {{nowrap|''x''≤''y''}} whenever ''x''∧''y''=''x''. For a join-semilattice, the order is induced by setting {{nowrap|''x''≤''y''}} whenever ''x''∨''y''=''y''. In a bounded meet-semilattice, the identity 1 is the greatest element of ''S''. Similarly, an identity element in a join semilattice is a least element.

== Connection between both definitions ==
An order theoretic meet-semilattice {{nowrap|&amp;lang;''S'', ≤&amp;rang;}} gives rise to a [[binary operation]] ∧ such that {{nowrap|&amp;lang;''S'', ∧&amp;rang;}} is an algebraic meet-semilattice. Conversely, the meet-semilattice {{nowrap|&amp;lang;''S'', ∧&amp;rang;}} gives rise to a [[binary relation]] ≤ that partially orders ''S'' in the following way: for all elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''S'', ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' = ''x'' ∧ ''y''.

The relation ≤ introduced in this way defines a partial ordering from which the binary operation ∧ may be recovered. Conversely, the order induced by the algebraically defined semilattice {{nowrap|&amp;lang;''S'', ∧&amp;rang;}} coincides with that induced by ≤.

Hence both definitions may be used interchangeably, depending on which one is more convenient for a particular purpose. A similar conclusion holds for join-semilattices and the dual ordering ≥.

== Examples ==
Semilattices are employed to construct other order structures, or in conjunction with other completeness properties.
* A [[lattice (order)|lattice]] is both a join- and a meet-semilattice. The interaction of these two semilattices via the [[absorption law]] is what truly distinguishes a lattice from a semilattice.
* The [[compact element]]s of an algebraic [[lattice (order)|lattice]], under the induced partial ordering, form a bounded join-semilattice.
* Any finite semilattice is bounded, by induction.
* A [[totally ordered set]] is a [[distributive lattice]], hence in particular a meet-semilattice and join-semilattice: any two distinct elements have a greater and lesser one, which are their meet and join.
** A [[well-ordered set]] is further a ''bounded'' meet-semilattice, as the set as a whole has a least element, hence it is bounded.
*** The nonnegative integers ℕ, with their usual order ≤, are a bounded meet-semilattice, with least element 0, although they have no greatest element: they are the smallest infinite well-ordered set.
* Any single-rooted [[Tree (set theory)|tree]] (with the single root as the least element) of height &lt;math&gt;\leq \omega&lt;/math&gt; is a meet-semilattice. Consider for example the set of finite words over some alphabet, ordered by the [[prefix order]]. It has a least element (the empty word) but no greatest element, and the root is the meet of all other elements.
* A [[Scott domain]] is a meet-semilattice.
* Membership in any set ''L'' can  be taken as a [[model theory|model]] of a semilattice with base set ''L'', because a semilattice captures the essence of set [[extensionality]]. Let ''a''∧''b'' denote ''a''∈''L'' &amp; ''b''∈''L''. Two sets differing only in one or both of the:
# Order in which their members are listed;
# Multiplicity of one or more members,
:are in fact the same set. Commutativity and associativity of ∧ assure (1), [[idempotence]], (2). This semilattice is the [[free semilattice]] over ''L''.  It is not bounded by ''L'', because a set is not a member of itself.
* Classical extensional [[mereology]] defines a join-semilattice, with join read as binary fusion. This semilattice is bounded from above by the world individual.

== Semilattice morphisms ==
The above algebraic definition of a semilattice suggests a notion of [[morphism]] between two semilattices. Given two join-semilattices {{nowrap|(''S'', ∨)}} and {{nowrap|(''T'', ∨)}}, a [[homomorphism]] of (join-) semilattices is a function ''f'': ''S'' → ''T'' such that

:''f''(''x'' ∨ ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') ∨ ''f''(''y'').

Hence ''f'' is just a homomorphism of the two [[semigroups]] associated with each semilattice. If ''S'' and ''T'' both include a least element 0, then ''f'' should also be a [[monoid]] homomorphism, i.e. we additionally require that

: ''f''(0) = 0.

In the order-theoretic formulation, these conditions just state that a homomorphism of join-semilattices is a function that [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preserves binary joins]] and least elements, if such there be. The obvious dual—replacing ∧ with ∨ and 0 with 1—transforms this definition of a join-semilattice homomorphism into its meet-semilattice equivalent.

Note that any semilattice homomorphism is necessarily [[monotone function|monotone]] with respect to the associated ordering relation. For an explanation see the entry [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preservation of limits]].

== Equivalence with algebraic lattices ==

There is a well-known [[Equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of join-semilattices with zero with &lt;math&gt;(\vee,0)&lt;/math&gt;-homomorphisms and the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; of [[algebraic lattice]]s with [[compact element|compactness]]-preserving complete join-homomorphisms, as follows. With a join-semilattice &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with zero, we associate its ideal lattice &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Id}\ S&lt;/math&gt;. With a &lt;math&gt;(\vee,0)&lt;/math&gt;-homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f \colon S \to T&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;(\vee,0)&lt;/math&gt;-semilattices, we associate the map &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Id}\ f \colon \operatorname{Id}\ S \to \operatorname{Id}\ T&lt;/math&gt;, that with any ideal &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; associates the ideal of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; generated by &lt;math&gt;f(I)&lt;/math&gt;. This defines a functor &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Id} \colon \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, with every algebraic lattice &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; we associate the &lt;math&gt;(\vee,0)&lt;/math&gt;-semilattice &lt;math&gt;K(A)&lt;/math&gt; of all [[compact element]]s of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and with every compactness-preserving complete join-homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f \colon A \to B&lt;/math&gt; between algebraic lattices we associate the restriction &lt;math&gt;K(f) \colon K(A) \to K(B)&lt;/math&gt;. This defines a functor &lt;math&gt;K \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. The pair &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{Id},K)&lt;/math&gt; defines a category equivalence between &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Distributive semilattices ==
Surprisingly, there is a notion of "distributivity" applicable to semilattices, even though distributivity conventionally requires the interaction of two binary operations. This notion requires but a single operation, and generalizes the distributivity condition for lattices. A join-semilattice is '''distributive''' if for all ''a'', ''b'', and ''x'' with {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;le; ''a'' &amp;or; ''b''}} there exist {{nowrap|''a' '' &amp;le; ''a''}} and {{nowrap|''b' '' &amp;le; ''b''}} such that {{nowrap begin}}''x'' = ''a' '' &amp;or; ''b' ''.{{nowrap end}} Distributive meet-semilattices are defined dually. These definitions are justified by the fact that any distributive join-semilattice in which binary meets exist is a distributive lattice. See the entry [[distributivity (order theory)]].

A join-semilattice is distributive if and only if the lattice of its [[ideal (order theory)|ideals]] (under inclusion) is distributive.

== Complete semilattices ==
Nowadays, the term "complete semilattice" has no generally accepted meaning, and various inconsistent definitions exist. If completeness is taken to require the existence of all infinite joins, or all infinite meets, whichever the case may be, as well as finite ones, this immediately leads to partial orders that are in fact [[complete lattice]]s. For why the existence of all possible infinite joins entails the existence of all possible infinite meets (and vice versa), see the entry [[completeness (order theory)]].

Nevertheless, the literature on occasion still takes complete join- or meet-semilattices to be complete lattices. In this case, "completeness" denotes a restriction on the scope of the [[homomorphism]]s. Specifically, a complete join-semilattice requires that the homomorphisms preserve all joins, but contrary to the situation we find for completeness properties, this does not require that homomorphisms preserve all meets. On the other hand, we can conclude that every such mapping is the lower adjoint of some [[Galois connection]]. The corresponding (unique) upper adjoint will then be a homomorphism of complete meet-semilattices. This gives rise to a number of useful [[duality (category theory)|categorical dualities]] between the categories of all complete semilattices with morphisms preserving all meets or joins, respectively.

Another usage of "complete meet-semilattice" refers to a [[bounded complete]] [[Complete partial order|cpo]]. A complete meet-semilattice in this sense is arguably the "most complete" meet-semilattice that is not necessarily a complete lattice. Indeed, a complete meet-semilattice has all ''non-empty'' meets (which is equivalent to being bounded complete) and all directed joins. If such a structure has also a greatest element (the meet of the empty set), it is also a complete lattice. Thus a complete semilattice turns out to be "a complete lattice possibly lacking a top". This definition is of interest specifically in [[domain theory]], where bounded complete [[algebraic poset|algebraic]] cpos are studied as [[Scott domain]]s. Hence Scott domains have been called ''algebraic semilattices''.

Cardinality-restricted notions of completeness for semilattices have been rarely considered in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;E. G. Manes, ''Algebraic theories'', Graduate Texts in Mathematics Volume 26, Springer 1976, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetmath.org/completesemilattice complete semilattices] on Planetmath.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free semilattices ==

This section presupposes some knowledge of [[category theory]]. In various situations, [[free object|free]] semilattices exist. For example, the [[forgetful functor]] from the category of join-semilattices (and their homomorphisms) to the [[category theory|category]] of sets (and functions) admits a [[adjoint functors|left adjoint]]. Therefore, the free join-semilattice '''F'''(''S'') over a set ''S'' is constructed by taking the collection of all non-empty ''finite'' [[subset]]s of ''S'', ordered by subset inclusion. Clearly, ''S'' can be embedded into '''F'''(''S'') by a mapping ''e'' that takes any element ''s'' in ''S'' to the singleton set {''s''}. Then any function ''f'' from a ''S'' to a join-semilattice ''T'' (more formally, to the underlying set of ''T'') induces a unique homomorphism ''f' '' between the join-semilattices '''F'''(''S'') and ''T'', such that ''f'' = ''f' '' o ''e''. Explicitly, ''f' '' is given by ''f' ''(''A'') = &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;{''f''(''s'') | ''s'' in ''A''}. Now the obvious uniqueness of ''f' '' suffices to obtain the required adjunction—the morphism-part of the functor '''F''' can be derived from general considerations (see [[adjoint functors]]). The case of free meet-semilattices is dual, using the opposite subset inclusion as an ordering. For join-semilattices with bottom, we just add the empty set to the above collection of subsets.

In addition, semilattices often serve as generators for free objects within other categories. Notably, both the forgetful functors from the category of [[complete Heyting algebra|frames]] and frame-homomorphisms, and from the category of distributive lattices and lattice-homomorphisms, have a left adjoint.

It is often the case that standard treatments of lattice theory define a semilattice, if that, and then say no more. See the references in the entries [[order theory]] and [[lattice theory]]. Moreover, there is no literature on semilattices of comparable magnitude to that on [[semigroup]]s.

The '''Seshat: Global History Databank''' is an international [[scientific research]] project of the [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[Evolution Institute]]. Founded in 2011, the [http://www.seshatdatabank.info ''Seshat: Global History Databank''] gathers data into a single, large database that can be used to test scientific hypotheses. The Databank consults directly with expert scholars to code what historical societies and their environments were like in the form of accessible datapoints and thus forms a [[Digital humanities|digital storehouse]] for data on the political and social organization of all human groups from the early modern back to the ancient and neolithic periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turchin|first1=Peter|last2=Brennan|first2=Rob|last3=Currie|first3=Thomas E.|last4=Feeney|first4=Kevin C.|last5=Francois|first5=Pieter|last6=Hoyer|first6=Daniel|last7=Manning|first7=J.

The Seshat: Global History Databank claims to be a scientific approach to historical research and its large dataset, though compiled with the intention of being theory-neutral, is frequently of interest to researchers of [[Cliodynamics]]. The main goal of Cliodynamics researchers is to use the [[scientific method]] to produce the data necessary to empirically test competing theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turchin |first=Peter |title= Arise cliodynamics |journal=Nature |date=2008 |doi= 10.1038/454034a |pmid=18596791 |volume=454 |issue=7200 |pages=34–35}} http://www.sott.net/articles/show/161508-Transforming-history-into-science-Arise-cliodynamics&lt;/ref&gt; A large interdisciplinary and international team of experts helps the Seshat project to produce a database that is historically rigorous enough to study the past using well-established scientific techniques. Seshat data may be used with [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural evolutionary theory]] or [[Cultural evolutionism|cultural evolutionary theory]] to identify long-term dynamics that may have had significant effects on the course of human history.

== Project ==

The Seshat: Global History Databank is an umbrella organization for several research projects that examine different themes or facets of human life. Each project is led by members of the Seshat Team in collaboration with a group of consultants and contributing experts. Themes include: the evolution of [[social complexity]] in early civilizations, the creation of [[Prosocial behavior|prosociality]] (i.e., how and why large groups of unrelated individuals come together and cooperate for a common goal), the role of [[ritual]] and [[religion]] in [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]], the causes of [[economic growth]] and its consequences on individual's [[well-being]], and many others. The Seshat team is also heavily engaged in improving the way that cutting-edge [[Semantic Web|digital technologies]] can aid in research, with projects devoted to developing cutting-edge systems for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information with computer assistance.

Several key research questions drive these research projects. These include the following: What mechanisms transform economic growth into improvements in quality of life for regular people? What roles do ritual activities and religion play in cultural development and group cohesion? How and under what conditions does [[prosocial behavior]] evolve in large societies? What is the impact of environmental and climatic factors in societal advance? &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info|title=Seshat: Global History Databank - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To maximise their time and resources, the Seshat project has begun data collection with a representative sample of polities from around the globe and throughout human history, ranging from the late [[Neolithic]] (roughly 4,000 BCE) to the early modern period (roughly 1,900 CE). This is the World Sample 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info/methods/world-sample-30/|title=World Sample 30 - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Sample-30 provides the Seshat project with an initial sample of societies that vary along the dimension of social complexity from ten major regions around the globe. Three natural geographic areas (NGAs) were selected within each region––one NGA was selected in each world region that developed complex state-level societies comparatively early; a second NGA was selected that selected complex societies comparatively late, ideally one free of centralized polities (chiefdoms and states) until the colonial period; a third NGA was selected that was intermediate to these two extremes in terms of social complexity.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Praise ===

[[Ian Morris (historian)]] recently praised two key aspects of the Seshat project: (1) it emphasizes the collection of data related to shifts in cultural systems (e.g., changes in religious morality or agricultural techniques) in addition to material elements (e.g., metallurgy technologies) and (2) it better situates seemingly extraordinary individuals in their geographic and historical context.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

[[Gary Feinman]] also praised the Seshat Project for helping to demolish the academic knowledge silos that have emerged with increases in specialisation over the last several decades.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Criticism ===

Critics of the Seshat project have noted that the coding of historical data is not a wholly objective enterprise and that concrete and transparent steps should be taken to minimize subjectivity in the coding process. The Seshat project uses multiple coders and experts and other techniques for ensuring data quality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collard |first=Mark |last2= Whitehouse |first2= Harvey |last3= Francois |first3= Pieter |last4= Slingerland |first4= Edward |last5= Turchin |first5= Peter |title=A Historical Database of Sociocultural Evolution |journal= Cliodynamics |date=2012 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some have recently suggested that machine coding techniques hold great promise for further reducing biases and increasing the reliability of the data produced.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

=== Funding ===

Funding for the Seshat: Global History Databank comes from the [[John Templeton Foundation]], the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], [[Horizon 2020]], the Tricoastal Foundation, and the Evolution Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seshatdatabank.info/seshat-about-us/acknowledgements/|title=Acknowledgements - Seshat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turchin|first1=Peter|last2=Brennan|first2=Rob|last3=Currie|first3=Thomas E.|last4=Feeney|first4=Kevin C.|last5=Francois|first5=Pieter|last6=Hoyer|first6=Daniel|last7=Manning|first7=J.

'''''Rochdale'' and ''Prince of Wales''''' were two troop ships that sank in Dublin Bay in 1807.

[[Dublin Port]] had long been dangerous because it was accessible only at high tide and was subject to sudden storms.  Many ships were lost while waiting for the tide, but little was done until this disaster.  The impact of 400 bodies&lt;ref&gt;Reports of the numbers lost are contradictory.  They vary from 380 to 500.   Most published reports say 400&lt;/ref&gt; being washed up on an urban shore had an effect on public and official opinion. This event was the impetus to the building of [[Dún Laoghaire]] Harbour.&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, H. A., 1980, ''Captain William Hutchison and the early Dublin Bay lifeboats''. Dublin Historical Record, 2: 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November 1807 several ships left [[Dublin Port|Dublin]] carrying troops bound for the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic war]].  The next day, two ships, the [[brig]] ''Rochdale'' and H.M. [[Packet ship]] ''Prince of Wales'', having been caught in gale-force winds and heavy snow, were lost.&lt;ref name=dlwalktour&gt;{{cite web | title = Historical Coastal Walking Tour | publisher = [[Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council]] | date =  | url = http://www.iopener.ie/downloads/iOpener-Dun-Laoghaire-Script.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 28 March 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120211081202/http://www.iopener.ie/downloads/iOpener-Dun-Laoghaire-Script.pdf | archivedate = 11 February 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Troops on ''Prince of Wales'' may have been deliberately locked below deck while the ship's captain and crew escaped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=4005 AAI | Physical Landscape&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123035401/http://askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=4005 |date=23 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] was launched.  There was looting.

==Maritime background==
This tragedy was the impetus to the building of Dún Laoghaire Harbour, which was initially called "Dunleary", then "Kingstown", and now "Dún Laoghaire".  [[Dublin port]] was hampered by a [[Shoal|sandbar]], which meant that ships could enter or leave only at high tide.  A solution, the building of the North Bull Wall, had been identified by Vice-Admiral [[William Bligh]] in 1800.  If there was a storm, a ship would have to ride out the storm in the open sea, waiting for the tide.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The bay of Dublin has perhaps been more fatal to seamen and ships than any in the world, for a ship once caught in it in a gale of wind from ENE to SSE must ride it out at anchors or go on shore, and from the nature of that shore the whole of the crews almost invariably have perished." – Captain [[Charles Malcolm]] of George IV's royal yacht.&lt;ref&gt;de Courcy Ireland, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A pier had been built at Dún Laoghaire, now known as the "coal harbour", in 1767, but it had rapidly silted up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlrcoco.ie/library/dlhist.htm Dún Laoghaire Library – A history of Dún Laoghaire]&lt;/ref&gt; The early nineteenth century was unusually stormy.&lt;ref&gt;John Sweeney,''A three-century storm climatology for Dublin 1715–2000'', Irish Geography, Volume 33(1), 2000, 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Dublin Bay was notoriously treacherous for boats. The remains of at least 600 vessels rest at the bottom of the bay.&lt;ref name=dlwalktour/&gt;

On 19 November 1807, the sea began to swell. [[Wind speed]] increased to hurricane force.  Sleet and snow fell to such intensity that visibility was reduced to zero; they may not have realised how close they were to shore.  The east wind blew the ships back towards the shore.

While ''Rochdale'' and ''Prince of Wales'' were lost, another troop transport, ''Lark'', which left earlier, safely reached [[Holyhead]].  Other ships were lost at that time.  A [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] was lost at the South Bull (outside Dublin Port).   The inbound [[Liverpool]] packet was lost off Bray.

== Military background ==
In July 1807, following military successes, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] signed the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Brandenburg-Prussia|Prussia]] leaving him master of central and eastern Europe. He then turned his attention westward to [[Mid-nineteenth century Spain|Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. The British government was alarmed. Soldiers were recruited to defend England's coast and to intervene in Spain (see [[Peninsular War]]) under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]].

Fear of an invasion of Ireland was further met by the building of [[Martello Tower]]s on the southern and eastern coasts and [[watchtower]]s on the other coastlines.

French troops had invaded Ireland on 22 August 1798, under [[Jean Joseph Amable Humbert|General Humbert]], establishing the short-lived [[Republic of Connacht]]. On that occasion the [[County Mayo|Mayo]] [[Militia (United Kingdom)#Irish militia|Militia]] was ingloriously defeated in what became known as the [[Battle of Castlebar#The "Races of Castlebar "|Races of Castlebar]]. In 1807 many members of the North Mayo and South Mayo Militias volunteered and were lost from the ''Prince of Wales''. They joined the [[97th Regiment of Foot]], the [[96th Regiment of Foot#Minorca Regiment|Minorca Regiment]], which was known as the "Queens Own Germans" as it was initially formed from Swiss and German mercenaries. (In 1816, the 97th was renumbered as the 96th).

The North Cork Militia was active in suppressing the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. They suffered a defeat at the [[Battle of Oulart Hill]]. In 1807, while most joined the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684-1922)|18th Regiment of Foot]] so many members of the North Cork Militia volunteered that they had to be dispersed over 25 different regiments.

They joined the British Army for a shilling a week and three meals a day – an alternative to terrible poverty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/radio1/seascapes/1118749.html Seascapes News Summary – 11 December 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011154759/http://www.rte.ie/radio1/seascapes/1118749.html |date=11 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HM Packet ship ''Prince of Wales''==
HM Packet ship ''Prince of Wales'' was a [[Sloop#Historic naval definition|sloop]] of 103 tons with a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of 11 feet.  She was built in [[Parkgate, Cheshire]] in 1787.

She sailed under Captain Robert Jones of Liverpool carrying the 97th regiment on 19 November.  The next day she had progressed only to a point opposite [[Bray Head]], a matter of a few miles.  She cast anchor, but the sea was so violent that she failed to come to anchor; she was blown back past Dún Laoghaire.  Her sails were completely torn.  She was driven onto rocks at [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]].
There was just one [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|longboat]] aboard.  Captain Jones, nine seamen, two women with children (family members), and two soldiers escaped on this lifeboat.  They did not know where they were, or how close they were to the shore.  They rowed parallel to the shore until one of the sailors fell overboard and found that he was standing in shallow water.
It was alleged that the troops were locked below deck, the ladder withdrawn, and the hatch battened down.  All 120 soldiers drowned in the storm and are interred in [[Merrion Cemetery, Bellevue|Merrion Cemetery]] not too far from where the incident occurred.

== ''Rochdale'' ==
''Rochdale'' was larger than ''Prince of Wales''. She was built in 1797; she was a brig of 135 tons and a ten-foot draught. She sailed under Captain Hodgson. She was driven along a similar path as the Prince of Wales. She cast anchors but the cable snapped. On shore cries of the terrified passengers could be heard. As she swept past Dún Laoghaire, soldiers on board fired their muskets to attract attention.  At Salthill, would-be rescuers had to shelter from the gunfire.  Off Blackrock, blue lights were seen and gunfire heard. She stuck the rocks at the Seapoint Martello tower. A twelve-foot plank would have rescued them, but all 265, including 42 women and 29 children, on board were lost. Their bodies were unrecognisable, being mutilated by the sea and the rocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=3577 Man and the landscape in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121152221/http://askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=3577 |date=21 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those who perished are interred in [[Carrickbrennan Churchyard]] in [[Monkstown, County Dublin|Monkstown]] with a memorial.

==Lifeboats==
Although there were lifeboats stationed at [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]], Bullock, [[Howth]], Dún Laoghaire and [[Islandbridge]] none were launched.

==Looting==
There was looting of the ships and the items washed ashore.  An immense amount of baggage was washed ashore and troops were put on guard. Looters gathered as was usual at the time and one from Dún Laoghaire was drowned. All the weekend was spent in collecting the bodies for burial.  The Regimental Silver Plate of the Queens Own Germans was lost.  Rewards were offered.  Six persons were convicted and sent to [[Kilmainham Gaol]] for plundering bodies or articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlrcoco.ie/gp/CommemorationCememony_221107.htm Hooper, Darrell, ''A Story of Lives Lost''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612141754/http://www.dlrcoco.ie/gp/CommemorationCememony_221107.htm |date=12 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder Charge==
Captain Robert Jones and his crew survived in the only lifeboat.  Two soldiers also survived.  The captain was accused of murder.&lt;ref&gt;[[Freeman's Journal]] 30 November: “Yesterday, Robert Jones, Master of the Prince of Wales, the Mate and the ship’s Steward, were fully committed to Newgate to abide their trial on a charge of murder for having removed the ladders that communicated between the deck and the hold of the vessel, whereby the passengers were prevented from making any exertion to escape the dreadful fate which they suffered.”&lt;/ref&gt;  The Captain said that the lifeboat was not launched; rather, it was cast into the sea by the storm, so he ordered those on deck to get into it.  Anthony McIntyre of the 18th Royal Irish said that the captain launched the lifeboat and that the ladder from the hold to the deck was withdrawn.  Andrew Boyle, also of the 18th Royal Irish, spoke through an Irish interpreter, saying that the ladder was not removed because “persons below held on to it very tightly”.  The verdict was "Casual death by shipwreck". The case was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Williamson, Robert Kennedy &amp; Cian Kennedy ''Lost at Sea'' CBC Monkstown Library {{cite web|url=http://www.cbcmonkstown.ie/library/carrickbrennan/lost_at_sea.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119002603/http://cbcmonkstown.ie/library/carrickbrennan/lost_at_sea.htm |archivedate=19 November 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dún Laoghaire Harbour ==
The [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] having been abolished, from 1 January 1801 Irish members of parliament had to travel to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].  That meant frequent travel across the [[Irish Sea]].
A campaign to build a harbour at Dún Laoghaire was already under way.  The person chiefly responsible was a resident [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[Licensed mariner|master mariner]] and [[Shipbroking|shipbroker]] named Richard Toucher, who worked tirelessly campaigning to bring about the construction of a safe port. His Asylum Harbour was conceived as a refuge for sailing ships in trouble in Dublin Bay.
After this tragedy, the campaign received the support required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=156&amp;version=text_only Transport at Dún Laoghaire Port] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124073218/http://askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=156&amp;version=text_only |date=24 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'asylum' in this context means a harbour where ships can seek refuge from a storm.

Construction commenced on a packet harbour at Howth, which was completed in 1809.  Travelling from Dublin to Howth meant travelling through the 'badlands of [[Sutton, Dublin|Sutton]]', where coaches were liable to be raided.&lt;ref&gt;Fewer, Michael, ''By Swerve of Shore'', (Gill, Dublin, 2002), {{ISBN|0-7171-3353-2}}, an account of the author's walk along the coast of [[County Dublin]]&lt;/ref&gt; Howth was a shallow harbour, and as larger ships were built, in particular with the introduction of steam packets from 1819, it became unsuitable, its rocky bottom precluded any dredging.

In 1815, eight Harbour Commissioners were appointed to supervise the building of a new harbour at Dún Laoghaire.  [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] visited in 1821, arriving at Howth and departing from Dún Laoghaire.  He renamed the town "Kingstown".&lt;ref&gt;Booterstown and Carysfort, A Parochial History 1821 to 1984, by Robert Knaggs {{cite web|url=http://booterstown.dublin.anglican.org/rkbook.asp?page%3D2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616010422/http://booterstown.dublin.anglican.org/rkbook.asp?page=2 |archivedate=16 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement issued in 2013 by the institute on its official web site read: "As of summer 2013, the Institute has suspended its activities following the formation of a new charity, [[The Idries Shah Foundation]]."&lt;ref name="ICR-Ceased-2014" /&gt;

==History==
The institute was founded in 1965 by the well-known writer, thinker and [[Sufism|Sufi]] teacher [[Idries Shah]]&lt;ref name="wintle"&gt;Justin Wintle (ed), ''Makers of Modern Culture'', Volume I, p474, Routledge, 2001, {{ISBN|0-415-26583-5}}.

In his book ''Listening to Idries Shah'', author, [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] and tutor, [[Ivan Tyrrell]] recounts a conversation in which Shah explained his reasons for founding the ICR: "I want to attract ordinary people and help them think about psychological and cultural issues. But, as an individual, I can't easily get people to listen seriously. I discovered, however, that if I call myself an 'institute' – they will," Shah told him.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"&gt;{{cite book

Retrieved on 2008-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and remit==
The Institute's stated aim was "to stimulate study, debate, education and research into all aspects of human thought, behaviour and culture" and to make the results of its members' academic work accessible to society and also to academics working in different fields.&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icr-about" /&gt;

The body, which had a number of distinguished Fellows, published several dozen academic monographs and some books over the years&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icr-about" /&gt; and held regular events.&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guidestar-statement"&gt;[http://www.guidestar.org.uk/gs_activities.aspx?CCReg=0AWV1MgzSc0%2fkY4xcMOB1g%3d%3d&amp;strQuery= ICR's statement of public benefit at Guidestar.org.uk], made in light of the new Charities Act. Retrieved on 2008-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt; These events usually included a series of six lectures by specialists per year, and a two-day seminar which is usually held in the Autumn. The aim of these was "to connect ideas across disciplines, across cultures, and even through history" and to bring about a broader, more holistic understanding by looking at issues from several different perspectives, with particular interest in human thought and behaviour and issues neglected by contemporary culture.&lt;ref name="guidestar-statement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icr-events"&gt;[http://www.i-c-r.org.uk/events/index.php Events held by the Institute for Cultural Research] Retrieved on 2008-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Institute supported projects in areas where freedom of access to facts was threatened,&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt; for example in the case of [[Afghanistan]] where assistance had been given to the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF)'s female educational projects.&lt;ref name="icr-about" /&gt;

All the Institute for Cultural Research's activities were open to the general public.&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt;

==Notable contributors==
The institute published so many [[monograph]]s and hosted so many [[lecture]]s and [[seminar]]s that only a small sample of notable contributors are listed here.&lt;ref name="scholar-list"&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=%22icr.org.uk%22&amp;btnG=Search Google Scholar search results for ICR publications (pdf files)] Retrieved on 2008-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1238">[http://tofet.org ToFeT] is a kinetic Monte Carlo electronic model of molecular films, able to simulate the time-of-flight experiment (ToF), [[field-effect transistor]]s (FeTs).  As its input, ToFeT takes a description of the film at a molecular level: a description of the position of all [[molecules]] and the interactions between them. As its output, ToFeT produces electrical characteristics such as [[Carrier mobility|mobilities]], [[JV curves]], and [[photocurrent transients]]. ToFeT thus allows the microscopic properties of a film to be related to its [[macroscopic]] electronic properties.

[http://tofet.org ToFeT] is an open-source project, used by academic and industrial groups around the world.  The current focus in ToFeT's development is to treat a wider range of materials systems, and reproduce a wider range of experimental measurements.

In Hebrew, the word "Tofet" stands for "inferno, scene of horror; hell",&lt;ref&gt;http://morfix.mako.co.il/default.aspx?q=%u05EA%u05D5%u05E4%u05EA&lt;/ref&gt; thus providing a fitting indication to the complexity of the model.

In 2004 the board of the [[University of Opole]]'s Faculty of [[Philology]] formally distanced itself from the theories propagated by Kamusella in a press release published by ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'', alleging methodological inadequacies and tendentious conclusions among other controversies in his historical research.&lt;ref name="Wyborcza2004"&gt;{{cite news |last=Łabutin |first=Beata |date=13 May 2004 |title=Uniwersytet dystansuje się od autora glosariusza |trans-title=The university distanced itself from the author of a glossary |url=http://opole.gazeta.pl/opole/1,35114,2072518.html |format=Press Release |language=Polish |newspaper=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]] |location=Warsaw |access-date=30 August 2015 |via=Wyborcza.pl Wiadomości z Opola |quote=Jak zapewnia dziekan Wydziału Filologicznego prof.

==Career in civil service==
In 1996, he was employed as the regional [[Plenipotentiary on European Integration to the Regional Governor (Pełnomocnik Wojewody ds. Integracji Europejskiej)]] in the Regional Authority (Urząd Wojewódzki), Opole.&lt;ref&gt;Integracja europejska a Śląsk Opolski [European Integration and Opole Silesia] (pp 6–12). 1997. ''Region Śląsk Opolski''. No 1. Opole, Poland: Ośrodek Informatyki WBD UW.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, from 1999 to 2002, he acted as Advisor on International Affairs to the Regional President (Doradca Marszałka ds. Współpracy z Zagranicą), Self-Governmental Regional Authority (Urząd Marszałkowski), Opole. In co-operation with the University of Opole, between 1997 and 2001, he managed the application in the Council of Europe, and financing that led to the establishment of the European Documentation Center in Opole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edc.uni.opole.pl |title=Centrum Dokumentacji Europejskiej |publisher=Edc.uni.opole.pl |accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This centre makes [[acquis communautaire]] available to the inhabitants of the Voivodeship of Opole and constituted a basis for founding a Department of Law at the University of Opole. In 1998, in the framework of the [[European Visitors Program]] of the European Union, he also visited the Spanish [[Autonomous Community]] of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], which, in the following year, led to the signing of the co-operation agreement between this Spanish region and the Opole Voivodeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umwo.opole.pl/docs/porozumienie_galicja.pdf |format=PDF |title=Porozumienie o współpracy pomiędzy : Autonomiczną Wspólnotą Galicja w Królestwie Hiszpanii |publisher=Umwo.opole.pl |accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8436">The '''top type''' in the [[type theory]] of [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[computer science]], commonly abbreviated as '''top''' or by the ''down tack'' symbol (⊤), is the ''universal'' type, sometimes called the ''universal supertype'' as all other types in any given type system are [[subtype]]s of top. In most cases it is the type which contains every possible object in the type system of interest. It is in contrast with the [[bottom type]], or the ''universal subtype'', which every other type is supertype of and in most cases it is the type that contains no members at all.

==Support in programming languages==
Several typed [[programming language]]s provide explicit support for the top type.

In [[Type system#Static type checking|statically-typed]] languages, there are two different, often confused, concepts when discussing the top type.
# A ''universal base class'' or other item at the top of a [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]] ''class hierarchy'' (often relevant in [[object-oriented programming]]) or ''type hierarchy''; it is often possible to create objects with this (run time) type, or it could be found when one examines the type hierarchy programmatically, in languages that support it
# A ([[compile time]]) ''static type'' in the code whose variables can be assigned any value (or a subset thereof, like any object pointer value), similar to [[Type system#Dynamic type checking and run time type information|dynamic typing]]
The first concept often implies the second, i.e., if a universal base class exists, then a variable that can point to an object of this class can also point to an object of any class. However, several languages have types in the second regard above (e.g., &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt; in C++, &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; in Objective-C, &lt;code&gt;interface {}&lt;/code&gt; in Go), static types which variables can accept any object value, but which do not reflect real run time types that an object can have in the type system, so are not top types in the first regard.

In dynamically-typed languages, the second concept does not exist (any value can be assigned to any variable anyway), so only the first (class hierarchy) is discussed. This article tries to stay with the first concept when discussing top types, but also mention the second concept in languages where it is significant.

The following object-oriented languages have no universal base class:
* [[C++]]. The ''pointer to void'' type can accept any non-function pointer, even though the [[void type]] itself is not the universal type but the [[unit type]].
* [[Objective-C]]. It is possible to create a new base class by not specifying a parent class for a class, although this is highly unusual. &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; is conventionally used as the base class in the original Objective-C run times. In the [[OpenStep]] and [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] Objective-C libraries, &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt; is conventionally the universal base class. The top type for pointers to objects is &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;.
* [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]]. It is possible to create a new base class by not specifying a parent class for a class. The protocol &lt;code&gt;Any&lt;/code&gt; can accept any type.
* [[PHP]].

===Other languages===
Languages that are not object-oriented usually have no universal supertype, or subtype polymorphism support.

While [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] purposefully lacks subtyping, it has several other forms of polymorphism including [[parametric polymorphism]]. The most generic type class parameter is &lt;code&gt;forall a. a&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly in [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], &lt;code&gt;&lt;T: ?Sized&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the most generic parameter (&lt;code&gt;&lt;T&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not, as it implies the &lt;code&gt;Sized&lt;/code&gt; trait).

The top type is used as a ''generic'' type, more so in languages without [[parametric polymorphism]].  For example, before introduing generics in [[Java 5]], collection classes in the Java library (excluding Java arrays) held references of type &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;. In this way, any non-intrinsic type could be inserted into a collection.  The top type is also often used to hold objects of unknown type.

In languages with a [[structural type system]], the top type is the empty structure. For example, objects in [[OCaml]] are structurally typed; the empty object type (the type of objects with no methods), &lt;code&gt;&lt; &gt;&lt;/code&gt;, is the top type of object types. Any OCaml object can be explicitly upcasted to this type, although the result would be of no use. [[Go (programming language)|Go]] also uses structural typing; and all types implement the empty interface: &lt;code&gt;interface {}&lt;/code&gt;.

The top type may also be seen as the implied type of non-statically typed languages.  Languages with run time typing often provide [[downcasting]] (or ''type refinement'') to allow discovering a more specific type for an object at run time.  In C++, downcasting from &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt; cannot be done in a ''safe'' way, where failed downcasts are detected by the language run time.

== In logic ==
The notion of ''top'' is also found in [[propositional calculus]], corresponding to a formula which is true in every possible interpretation. It has a similar meaning in [[predicate calculus]]. In [[description logic]], top is used to refer to the set of all concepts. This is intuitively like the use of the top type in programming languages. For example, in the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL), which supports various description logics, top corresponds to the class &lt;code&gt;owl:Thing&lt;/code&gt;, where all classes are subclasses of &lt;code&gt;owl:Thing&lt;/code&gt;. (the bottom type or empty set corresponds to &lt;code&gt;owl:Nothing&lt;/code&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12465">'''Transition scenarios''' are descriptions of future states which combine a future image with an account of the changes that would need to occur to reach that future. These two elements are often created in a two-step process where the future image is created first (envisioning) followed by an exploration of the alternative pathways available to reach the future goal ([[backcasting]]). Both these processes can use participatory techniques ([[Paul Raskin|Raskin]] et al., 2002&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, P., T. Banuri, G. Gallopín, P. Gutman, A. Hammond, R. Kates, and R. Swart. (2002). The Great Transition: The Promise and the Lure of the Times Ahead. Boston, MA: [[Tellus Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;) where participants of varying backgrounds and interests are provided with an open and supportive group environment to discuss different contributing elements and actions.

Transition scenarios are unique in type not only in terms of how they are created (process) but also their content. Their requirements are guided by transition management concepts and consider the "fundamental and irreversible change in the culture, structure and practices of a system" (Sondeijker, 2009:52,&lt;ref&gt;Sondeijker, S. (2009), Imagining Sustainability: methodological building blocks for Transition Scenarios, DRIFT, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;). Transition scenarios are emerging as a scenario type which is more applicable to the context of sustainable development based on their abilities to capture the complexities of system structure and innovation (Loorbach, 2007; Rotmans, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Loorbach, D.A. (2007), Transition Management: new mode of governance for sustainable development, DRIFT, Rotterdam&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotmans, J. (2005) Societal Innovation: Between Dream and Reality Lies Complexity, Inaugural Speech, Rotterdam, Erasmus Research Institute of Management&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Scenario types==

There are various types of scenarios that can be used for a range of purposes and are predominantly split between first, second and third generation scenarios.

===First generation===
First generation scenarios are intended to predict the future as accurately as possible, for instance by extrapolating trends. Examples of these scenarios are weather predictions, forecasts for a wide range of topics such as economic growth, population, building volume etc. They are predominantly based on the quantitative / econometric extrapolation of trends. Another part is based on qualitative "trend watching methods" (e.g. fashion).

===Second generation===
Second generation scenarios have a more explorative character. Scenarios can be intended to explore possibilities for the future, without pronouncing upon their probability or desirability. Scenarios can then be defined as "a tool for ordering alternative future environments in which one's decision may be played out" (Peter Schwartz, 1991,&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, P. (1991). The art of the long view. Doubleday. New York, USA&lt;/ref&gt;). These scenarios are based on the presumption that nobody can predict, and therefore should not try to predict the future. "The only relevant discussions about the future are those where we succeed from shifting from the question "whether something will happen" to the question "what will we do IF something happens" (Arie de Geus, 1998,&lt;ref&gt;De Geus, A. (1997). The living company. Longview Publishing Limited, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;). An example of this type of scenario was developed by Shell (The Shell scenario method).

===Third generation===
Third generation scenarios focus on long time spans and preferred societal systems which are normative and explorative in nature and reflective of the structural and societal changes required in pursuing sustainability (Sondeijker, 2009; Edquist 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Sondeijker, S. (2009), Imagining Sustainability: methodological building blocks for Transition Scenarios, DRIFT, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edquist, C. (2005). Systems of innovation: Perspectives and challenges. In J. Fagerberg, D. C. Mowery &amp; R. R. Nelson (Eds.), The Oxford handbook of innovation (pp. 181-208). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;). These scenarios are intended to produce a picture of the future we want. The question then is: "what do we actually want the future to look like?", examples of these scenarios are based, amongst others, on the European Awareness method and include the use of energy in urban environments, sustainable production and consumption, and normative "factor 4" studies. These scenarios were devised based on the claim that scenarios active in first and second generation scenario methods cannot live up to the challenge of imagining, contributing and preparing for the dynamic processes of transformative change. Transitions are complex interactions which need system approaches to define paths towards a sustainable future and transition scenarios are set to address these concerns by providing a method to handle these issues.

==Content and process==

The creation of transition scenarios has two basic objectives. To ensure that the scenario created is relevant to the concepts of transition management to allow the system to be systematically analysed and to contribute to social learning. These objectives are encapsulated in the content and process, respectively, of transition scenario creation.

==Content==
Transition scenarios are informed by transition management concepts and theories which it uses as a basis for its contents. In particular, transition scenarios consider long time frames and are both normative and explorative in nature. Their contents are predominantly centred on the following elements (Sondeijker 2009; Geels, F. W, 2002, Kemp et al. 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Sondeijker, S. (2009), Imagining Sustainability: methodological building blocks for Transition Scenarios, DRIFT, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F. W. (2002), Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: A multi-level perspective and a case-study, Research Policy 31(8/9), 1257-1274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, R., Schot, J., Hoogma, R. (1998), Regime shifts to sustainability through processes of niche formation: the approach of strategic niche management, In: Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 10(2): 175-195.&lt;/ref&gt;):

===Multi-level criteria===
Multi-level criteria relate to elements of change (weak signals) that can be identified in present structures occurring at different levels of the system. These provide the opportunity to recognise and investigate levers than can be used for long run transitions. Weak signals combined with uncertain developments can produce the appropriate climate for structural change. Anticipation of weak signals is essential if the development of scenarios beyond the scope of current developments is to be reached.

===Multi-pattern criteria===
Multi-pattern criteria describe the interaction between actors and structure of the system being analysed. This includes action derived from bottom-up initiatives which are built up from actor groups which are involved in niche-based innovation activities which infiltrate and eventually change the dominant regimes. Equally important are actors across and between levels which can support and further accelerate change. This ensures that practices and habits in the system are transformed through the replacement of the old dominant regime with the new desired future state.

===Multi-phase criteria===
Multi-phase criteria refer to the different timings of the alternating stages involved in transition management: predevelopment phase, take-off phase, acceleration phase and the stabilisation phase. The nature and speeds of these phases inform the character of the transition highlighting the importance of the barriers and drivers identified. In the take-off phase the point of no return is reached followed by the acceleration phase where cultural, structural and practice changes occur most visibly.

==Process==
Transition scenarios are also process orientated focusing on the ability of different stakeholders and participants to communicate and imagine their desired future within the discussion groups. Through this participatory process participants are encouraged to change mind set and attitude to think from a long-term perspective. Specific focus on various feasible topics will increase participants' knowledge of the topic area and the alternatives available in its context. These lessons may eventually be internalised within participants resulting in a social learning process (Social Learning Group, 2001,&lt;ref&gt;Social Learning Group (2001). Learning to manage global environmental risks. Edited by S.L.Group, Vol 1&amp;2, Cambridge Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Sustainable low-carbon futures==
{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2012}}
Europe, along with the rest of the world, is facing the challenge of climate change and its impacts on the environment, economy and society. In order to address these concerns and to adopt a proactive approach in finding solutions, the European Commission launched its Europe 2020 Strategy in 2010 followed by its Roadmap for 2050. The 2020 strategy puts forward a vision of a Europe which has increased employment, invests in research and development, ensures more young people finish school and obtain university degrees, has fewer people threatened by poverty, has a reduced greenhouse gas level of 20% compared with 1990 level, has an increased contribution of renewable energy to reach 20% of total energy consumption and has increased efficiency by 20%. The 2050 Roadmap sets forward possibilities to reaching the more stringent 80% reduction target of greenhouse gases in 2050 by considering various scenarios and setting milestones for a 40% reduction by 2030 and 60% by 2040.

It is clear from this strategy and roadmap that Europe needs to transition to a future which is quite different from the one which follows a "business as usual" trajectory. This need formed the basis from which the [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development#Framework Programme 7|EU Seventh Framework Programme]] (FP7) under its call "Foresight to enhance behavioural and societal changes enabling the transition towards sustainable paths in Europe" was created. Three projects focusing on transition scenarios and management were selected to provide range in application and context. These projects are as follows:

* CRISP (CReating Innovative Sustainability Pathways) aims to identify sustainable low carbon futures and pathways. This intent will allow the project to recommend new policy mixes and innovative cooperation mechanisms that will support and promote transitions. In order to achieve these objectives, it employs transition scenarios and participatory approaches to ensure people of all ages and backgrounds are actively involved in the discourse on sustainable development.
* INCONTEXT (Individuals in Context: Supportive Environments for Sustainable Living) studies both the internal and external contexts in which change occurs. Through the use of multi-disciplinary approaches insights into the role played by social norms, policies and infrastructure (external context) and needs, values and priorities (internal context) can be gauged within the agency-structure debate. The project’s main output is to help inform policies that can support internal changes required for sustainable action.
* LOCAW (Low Carbon at Work: Modelling agents and organisations to achieve transition to a low carbon Europe) aims to gain insight into the drivers and barriers of sustainability practices within the work place across different organizations within the EU. The multi-disciplinary approach is used to create the desirable low-carbon futures, map the alternative pathways and gain insight into how cooperative interaction needs to be supported to encourage sustainable development. This latter point is predominantly investigated through the use of agent based modelling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4936">A '''version vector''' is a mechanism for tracking changes to data in a [[distributed system]], where multiple agents might update the data at different times. The version vector allows the participants to determine if one update preceded another ([[happened-before]]), followed it, or if the two updates happened concurrently (and therefore might conflict with each other). In this way, version vectors enable [[causality]] tracking among data replicas and are a basic mechanism for [[optimistic replication]].  In mathematical terms, the version vector generates a [[preorder]] that tracks the events that precede, and may therefore influence, later updates.

Version vectors maintain state identical to that in a [[vector clock]], but the update rules differ slightly;  in this example, replicas can either experience local updates (e.g., the user editing a file on the local node), or can synchronize with another replica:

* Initially all vector counters are zero.
* Each time a replica experiences a local update event, it increments its own counter in the vector by one.
* Each time two replicas &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; synchronize, they both set the elements in their copy of the vector to the maximum of the element across both counters:  &lt;math&gt;V_a[x] = V_b[x] = max(V_a[x], V_b[x])&lt;/math&gt;.  After synchronization, the two replicas have identical version vectors.

Pairs of replicas, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, can be compared by inspecting their version vectors and determined to be either: identical (&lt;math&gt;a=b&lt;/math&gt;), concurrent (&lt;math&gt;a \parallel b&lt;/math&gt;), or ordered (&lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b &lt; a&lt;/math&gt;).  The ordered relation is defined as:  Vector &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if every element of &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; is less than or equal to its corresponding element in &lt;math&gt;V_b&lt;/math&gt;, and at least one of the elements is strictly less than.  If neither &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b &lt; a&lt;/math&gt;, but the vectors are not identical, then the two vectors must be concurrent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4205">The '''wenxiang diagram,''' also known as the  '''wenxiang graph''', was proposed in 1997 by [[Kuo-Chen Chou]] (周国城), Chun-Ting Zhang (张春霆), and Gerald M. Maggiora for helping intuitively analyze the disposition of amphiphilic [[alpha helix|alpha helices]] in heteropolar environments&lt;ref name="chou01"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chou KC, Zhang CT, Maggiora GM | title = Disposition of amphiphilic helices in heteropolar environments | journal = Proteins | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–108 |date=May 1997 | pmid = 9144795 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0134(199705)28:1&lt;99::AID-PROT10&gt;3.0.CO;2-C }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the earlier 2D diagram called a "helical wheel",&lt;ref name="pmid6048867"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schiffer M, Edmundson AB | title = Use of helical wheels to represent the structures of proteins and to identify segments with helical potential | journal = Biophys.

This diagram is named after the [[mosquito coil]] ({{zh|c=[[:zh:蚊香|蚊香]]|p=wénxiāng}}), a coiled incense for repelling mosquitos, because of its similar shape.

[[Image:Wenxiang diagram.jpg|thumb|right| Example of wenxiang diagram for a 7-turn amphipathic helix (generated by the [http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/wenxiang2  Wenxiang] server)]]
Because the wenxiang diagram is generated by a conical projection of a helix onto a plane, with the start (N-terminus) of the helix at the edge and the end toward the center, the location of each residue in a helix is not only defined by an angle around the diagram’s center, but is also defined by its radius from the center of the diagram in number of turns, which corresponds to its distance along the helix, in number of turns. Therefore, in principle, the wenxiang diagram can be used to represent an [[alpha-helix]] of any length.

A '''zero-propellant maneuver''' (ZPM) is an optimal attitude trajectory used to perform spacecraft rotational control without the need to use thrusters. ZPMs are designed for spacecraft that use momentum storage actuators. Spacecraft ZPMs are used to perform large angle rotations or rate damping (detumbling) without saturating momentum actuators, and momentum dumping (from storage) without thrusters.

==Background==
Spacecraft rotational operations, such as turning to point in a new direction, are usually performed by [[angular momentum]] storage devices such as [[reaction wheels]] or [[control moment gyroscope]]s. It is generally preferable to use these devices instead of traditional [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]], as they are powered by renewable electricity instead of by propellant; firing thrusters uses up the fixed amount of propellant on the spacecraft. Propellant is very costly because it must be carried from earth; once it is used up, the spacecraft's life is over. Therefore, the operational life of the spacecraft is determined by the amount of propellant carried, and the rate at which the propellant is used up. Propellant is used for two main purposes: to maintain the spacecraft in orbit, and to control rotation. Therefore, the less propellant that has to be used for controlling rotation, the more that is available for maintaining orbit, and the longer the lifetime of the spacecraft.

However, momentum storage devices have a limited capacity, and that capacity soon becomes saturated when they are required to absorb spacecraft disturbance torques caused by ([[gravity gradient]], [[solar wind]], and [[aerodynamic drag]]); when in other words they reach their momentum storage limit. Once saturation is reached, momentum storage devices cannot apply torque to control the spacecraft's orientation. The spacecraft then typically requires thrusters using propellant to 'desaturate' the storage devices, in other words to unload the accumulated momentum, and so to restore the spacecraft's full ability to carry out rotational operations.

Spacecraft experience [[orbital decay]] due to [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]]. To maintain their orbit, thrusters are used to [[reboost]] the spacecraft to a higher altitude. Because on board propellant capacity is limited, the spacecraft can only perform a limited number of momentum desaturations or reboosts. Therefore, if momentum desaturations can be reduced or eliminated, a larger fraction of propellant can be used to maintain the spacecraft in its desired [[orbit]], and it will have a longer operational lifetime.

Typically spacecraft rotations are performed as [[quaternion]] rotations or about a fixed axis ([[Euler's rotation theorem]]) usually referred to as an eigenaxis. Rotations about an eigenaxis result in the smallest angle between two orientations. Moreover, eigenaxis rotations are performed with a fixed rotation rate or maneuver rate. However, to maintain the spacecraft rotation about the eigenaxis, and at a fixed maneuver rate, requires the momentum storage actuators to overcome disturbance torques acting on the spacecraft. Depending on the intensity of the disturbances, the size of rotation and momentum storage device capacity, momentum storage devices can become saturated even if the spacecraft is rotated at a small maneuver rate.

Fortunately, however, the choice of rotation path impacts the spacecraft performance. This enables ZPMs to offer a new way to perform spacecraft rotations. Unlike eigenaxis smallest angle rotations, ZPMs are larger angle but minimum fuel rotations. Unlike eigenaxis fixed axis and maneuver rate rotations, ZPM rotations vary the rotation axis and maneuver rate during the maneuver. Just like eigenaxis rotations, ZPM rotations can be generated by commanding the spacecraft with a time varying attitude and rate command. However, ZPM rotations require significantly more time than eigenaxis rotations.  ZPM trajectories can also be used to reduce propellant consumption even when the spacecraft uses thrusters instead of momentum storage devices. This application is referred to as a Reduced Propellant Maneuver (RPM) since even though propellant use is minimized some propellant will have to be used.

==Theory==
A ZPM is a non-eigenaxis attitude trajectory that exploits the spacecraft environmental dynamics (e.g. gravity gradient, solar pressure, aerodynamics etc.) to eliminate the need for mass expulsion actuators during rotational operations.&lt;ref&gt;N. Bedrossian, S. Bhatt, W. Kang, [[I. Michael Ross|I. M. Ross]], "Zero Propellant Maneuver Guidance," IEEE Control Systems Magazine, Vol. 29, Issue 5, October 2009, pp. 53–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Bedrossian, and S. Bhatt, "Space Station Zero Propellant Maneuver Guidance Trajectories Compared to Eigenaxis," Proceedings of the American Control Conference, 2008, pp. 4833–4838.&lt;/ref&gt;

ZPMs are developed by solving a specific nonlinear two-point-boundary-value optimal control problem for a fixed maneuver end time. Whereas an eigenaxis maneuver maintains a constant rotation axis and maneuver rate, a ZPM uses a time varying rotation axis and maneuver rate. An eigenaxis maneuver attitude trajectory tries to overcome disturbances to maintain a constant maneuver rate, which results in saturating the momentum storage devices. By using a variable maneuver rate, ZPMs avoid saturation of momentum storage actuators.

A simplified model for a spacecraft ZPM is a sailboat. A sailboat tacks against the wind to travel in a zig-zag manner without using its outboard motors thus not using any propellant. The sailboat takes advantage of the winds just like ZPM takes advantage of spacecraft environmental disturbances. The sailboat does not take the shortest path to travel from one location to the other. Similarly, a ZPM does not take the shortest angular path between two orientations. One can think of the sailboat rudder as the equivalent of the momentum storage actuators on a spacecraft.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Applications==
ZPMs were demonstrated on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration. "Fact Sheet: International Space Station Zero-Propellant Maneuver (ZPM) Demonstration." June 10, 2011. (Sept. 13, 2011) http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/ZPM.html&lt;/ref&gt; On November 5, 2006, the ISS performed a 90 degree ZPM &lt;ref&gt;N. Bedrossian, S. Bhatt, M. Lammers, L. Nguyen, and Y. Zhang, "First Ever Flight Demonstration of Zero Propellant Maneuver Attitude Control Concept," Proceedings of the AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference, 2007, AIAA 2007–6734.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2 hours, while on March 3, 2007 the ISS performed a 180 degree ZPM &lt;ref&gt;N. Bedrossian, S. Bhatt, M. Lammers, and L. Nguyen, "Zero Propellant Maneuver Flight Results for 180° ISS Rotation," Proceedings of the International Symposium on Space Flight Dynamics, 2007, NASA/CP-2007-214158.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2 hours and 47 minutes. The ZPM [[optimal control]] problems for both ISS maneuvers were solved using [[DIDO (software)|DIDO]] software.

==History==

The 90° ISS ZPM was developed by Sagar Bhatt for his Master's thesis.&lt;ref&gt;S. Bhatt, "Optimal Reorientation of Spacecraft Using Only Control Moment Gyroscopes," Master's Thesis, Dept. of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Rice University, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
