The '''Abtew Method''' is a [[remote sensing]] method for measuring [[evapotranspiration]] created by Wossenu Abtew in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Abtew W. Evapotranspiration Measurements and Modeling for Three Wetland Systems in South Florida. J. Am. Water Resour. Assn. 1996;32:465–473.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as the radiative Abtew model.

==Equation==
The Abtew Method has advantages over other methods in that it only depends on solar radiation data. This is useful when modeling evaporation in areas where satellite remote sensing solar radiation data is the only data available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melesse|first=Assefa M.|last2=Abtew|first2=Wossenu|last3=Dessalegne|first3=Tibebe|date=2009-12-01|title=Evaporation Estimation of Rift Valley Lakes: Comparison of Models|journal=Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)|volume=9|issue=12|pages=9603–9615|doi=10.3390/s91209603|issn=1424-8220|pmc=3267190|pmid=22303142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equation is represented as&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Evaluation and generalization of radiation-based methods for calculating evaporation|url=http://folk.uio.no/chongyux/papers_SCI/HYP_4.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; ET = K\frac{R_{s}}{\lambda }&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt; ET &lt;/math&gt; is evapotranspiration in millimeters/day
* &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless coefficient
* &lt;math&gt; R_{s}&lt;/math&gt; is solar radiation measured in MJ/m^2/day
* &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; is [[latent heat of vaporization]] in  MJ/kg

'''Acantha''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀκάνθα, [[English language|English translation]]: "thorny"{{Source?|reason=The common translation, for example in Liddell &amp; Scott is the noun "thorn, prickle" and not the adjective "thorny"|date=October 2018}}) is often claimed to be a minor character in [[Greek mythology]] whose metamorphosis was the origin of the ''[[Acanthus (plant)|Acanthus]]'' plant.&lt;ref name="Coulter and Turner"&gt;Coulter, Charles Russell and Turner, Patricia (2000). ''Encyclopedia Of Ancient Deities''. Routledge. pg.62. {{ISBN|1579582702}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tale goes that Acantha was a [[nymph]] loved by the god [[Apollo]]. Acantha however rebuffed Apollo's advances and scratched his face. As a result, Apollo transformed her into the Acanthus, a plant with spiny leaves.&lt;ref name="Beeton"&gt;[[Samuel Orchart Beeton|Beeton, Samuel Orchart]] (1871). ''Beeton's Classical dictionary''.

[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The percentage of [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] [[sunlight]] relative to various surface conditions]]

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}) ({{lang-la|albedo}}, meaning 'whiteness') is the measure of the [[diffuse reflection]] of [[sunlight|solar radiation]] out of the total [[solar radiation]] received by an [[astronomical body]] (e.g. a [[planet]] like [[Earth]]). It is [[dimensionless number|dimensionless]] and measured on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation).

Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of irradiance reflected to the irradiance received by a surface. The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter9/Ency_Atmos/Reflectance_Albedo_Surface.pdf |title=Reflectance and albedo, surface |work=Encyclopedia of the Atmosphere |editors=J. R. Holton and J. A. Curry |last=Coakley |first=J. A. |publisher=Academic Press |year=2003|isbn= |location= |pages=1914–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see [[position of the Sun]]). While bi-hemispherical [[reflectance]] is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.

Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henderson-Sellers |first=A. |last2=Wilson |first2=M. F.|year=1983 |quote=Albedo observations of the Earth's surface for climate research |jstor=37357 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A |volume=309 |issue=1508 |title=The Study of the Ocean and the Land Surface from Satellites |pages=285–94 |bibcode=1983RSPTA.309..285H |doi=10.1098/rsta.1983.0042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes [[visible spectrum|visible light]] (0.39–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).

Albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and environmental management (e.g., as part of the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings). The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30–35% because of [[cloud cover]], but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Encyclopedia |edition=3rd |publisher=Thompson Gale |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7876-5486-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term albedo was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''[[Photometria]]''.

Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name="PhysicsWorld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo – from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name="Goode"/&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

[[File:Ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|upight-1.2|left|2003–2004 mean annual clear-sky and total-sky albedo]]
Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites, and the CERES instrument on the [[Suomi NPP]] and [[Joint Polar Satellite System|JPSS]]. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;). These calculations are based on the [[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function|bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)]], which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.

Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15&amp;nbsp;°C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="washington" /&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="clim-past"/&gt; In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water — a so-called aquaplanet — the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Smith Robin"/&gt;

===White-sky and black-sky albedo===
For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;{D-1}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of diffuse illumination.

Hence, the actual albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{ \bar \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Directional-hemispherical reflectance]] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]] as white-sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name="BlueskyAlbedo"/&gt;

== Astronomical albedo ==

The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[minor planet]]s such as [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96.&lt;ref name="sicardy"&gt;

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [[regolith]] surfaces.

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==

===Illumination===
Albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth's surface at that location (e.g. through albedo-temperature feedback). That said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99 |pages=818–827| bibcode=1971MWRv...99..818W| date=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099&lt;0818:TACOZM&gt;2.3.CO;2| issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insolation effects ===
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]] (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the [[arctic]] and [[antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the [[Sahara Desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  [[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rainforest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the [[Earth]]. This has been a concern since arctic ice and [[snow]] has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This [[Ice-albedo feedback|feedback loop]] results in a reduced albedo effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721364-commercial-opportunities-are-vastly-outweighed-damage-climate-thawing-arctic|title=The thawing Arctic threatens an environmental catastrophe|journal=The Economist|access-date=2017-05-08|date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate and weather===
Albedo affects [[climate]] by determining how much [[radiation]] a planet absorbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=av7q4N8Ib6sC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Albedo+affects+climate+by+determining+how+much+radiation+a+planet+absorbs#v=onepage&amp;q=Albedo%20affects%20climate%20by%20determining%20how%20much%20radiation%20a%20planet%20absorbs&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather: Abs-Ero|last=Schneider|first=Stephen Henry|last2=Mastrandrea|first2=Michael D.|last3=Root|first3=Terry L.|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199765324|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive [[weather]].

===Albedo–temperature feedback===
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

===Snow===
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, D.K. and Martinec, J. (1985), Remote sensing of ice and snow. Chapman and Hall, New York, 189 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Over [[Antarctica]] snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo [[positive feedback]]).

Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref&gt;"All About Sea Ice." National Snow and Ice Data Center. Accessed 16 November 2017. /cryosphere/seaice/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important to the modern theory of [[Global warming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name = "Nat. Geo"&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 "Changing Greenland – Melt Zone"] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name="ranknfile-ue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool! (August 1997) |publisher=Ranknfile-ue.org |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar photovoltaic effects ===
Albedo can affect the [[electrical energy]] output of solar [[photovoltaic system|photovoltaic device]]s. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrews | first1 = Rob W. | last2 = Pearce | first2 = Joshua M. | date = 2013 | title = The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 91 | pages = 233–241 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 |bibcode = 2013SoEn...91..233A | url = https://www.academia.edu/3081684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = M.P. | authorlink4 = J.

===Trees===
Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and [[visible spectrum]] is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of [[deforestation]]). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Betts | first1 = RA | date = 2000 | title = Offset of the potential carbon sink from boreal forestation by decreases in surface albedo | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = 6809| pages = 187–190 | doi = 10.1038/35041545 | pmid=11089969|bibcode = 2000Natur.408..187B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [[evapotranspiration]]. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boucher | date = 2004 | title = Direct human influence of irrigation on atmospheric water vapour and climate | journal = Climate Dynamics | volume = 22 | issue = 6–7| pages = 597–603 | doi=10.1007/s00382-004-0402-4|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2004ClDy...22..597B | url = https://www.academia.edu/25329256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonan | first1 = GB | date = 2008 | title = Forests and Climate Change: Forcings, Feedbacks, and the Climate Benefits of Forests | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5882| pages = 1444–1449 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155121 | pmid=18556546|bibcode = 2008Sci...320.1444B  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name="mmutrees" /&gt;

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name="Betts" /&gt;

===Water===
[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (refractive index=1.333)]]
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).

At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name="Fresnel" /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.
Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. "On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth."&lt;ref name="livescience"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=24 January 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contrails reduce daily temperature range|url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|journal=Nature |accessdate=7 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|archivedate=3 May 2006|page=601|volume=418|issue=6898|format=PDF|date=8 August 2002|deadurl=yes|doi=10.1038/418601a|bibcode = 2002Natur.418..601T|pmid=12167846|last1=Travis|first1=D.

G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&amp;nbsp;°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Kuwait oil fires as seen by Landsat |date=30 May 1991|bibcode=1992JGR....9714565C |author1=Cahalan |first1=Robert F. |volume=97 |issue=D13 |page=14565 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres |doi=10.1029/92JD00799|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23842551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name="girda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=19 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per &lt;ref name="DOMINICK" /&gt; the effects are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="girda 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=19 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l. Acad. of Sci. 423 (13 January 2004) ("The efficacy of this forcing is »2 (i.e., for a given forcing it is twice as effective as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in altering global surface air temperature)"); ''compare'' Zender Testimony, ''supra'' note 7, at 4 (figure 3); See J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 18, at 426. ("The efficacy for changes of Arctic sea ice albedo is &gt;3. In additional runs not shown here, we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in Antarctica is also &gt;3."); ''See also'' Flanner, M.G., C.S. Zender, J.T. Randerson, and P.J. Rasch, ''Present-day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow'', 112 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D11202 (2007) ("The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset, triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the "efficacy" of black carbon/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.").&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human activities===
Human activities (e.g., deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Other types of albedo==
[[Single-scattering albedo]] is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

[[File:Barys rock in Druja.jpg|thumbnail|Boris stone in [[Druya]]]]

'''Boris Stones''' ({{lang-be|Барысавы камяні}}, {{IPA-be|baˈrɨsavɨ kamʲaˈni|}}; {{lang-ru|Борисовы камни}}), also called '''Dvina Stones''' ({{lang-ru|Двинские камни}}), are seven medieval [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s erected along the bank of the [[Western Dvina]] between [[Polotsk]] and [[Drissa]], [[Belarus]]. They probably predate [[Christianity]] in the area, but were inscribed in the 12th century with text and an image of [[Christ]]. The largest of the stones is 17 metres in circumference. 

==History==
Although these landmarks were described in the 16th century by [[Maciej Stryjkowski]], it was [[Georg von Cancrin]] in 1818 who first brought them to scholarly attention. Cancrin discovered that a boulder near [[Orsha]] had the following inscription: "In the year 1171, on the 7th day of March, was completed this cross. Lord, please help your servant Basil, whose other name is Rogvolod, Boris' son".&lt;ref&gt;Franklin 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, several other boulders with Boris's name were discovered. In the 1930s, two of these were blown up by Communist authorities as religious objects and their remains used to pave the road between Minsk and Moscow. Another one was thrown into the river, where it lay until its discovery in 1988. When an attempt to recover it was made, the stone broke apart into three pieces. Three other boulders were moved to be exhibited near St. Sophia Cathedral in [[Polotsk]], in the Museum of Boulders in [[Minsk]], and in [[Kolomenskoe]] near [[Moscow]].

==Description==
Both names for the stones are somewhat misleading: only four of them are located along the banks of the Dvina, and one of the stones does not mention Boris at all. What unites them is their programmatic illustration: "In each case the centrepiece is an enormous cross flanked by abbreviated elements of the conventional Greek legend proclaiming Christ's victory".&lt;ref&gt;Franklin 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted that the Boris mentioned in the inscriptions was [[Rogvolod Vseslavich]] (baptismal name "Boris"), [[Vseslav of Polotsk|Vseslav]]'s son, although it is quite likely that such boulders had been venerated by pagan [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] long before the land was [[Conversion to Christianity|Christianised]].

[[File:Halon-1301-3D-vdW.png|thumb|[[Bromotrifluoromethane]]]]

'''Bromofluorocarbons''' (BFCs) are molecules based on [[carbon]], [[bromine]], and [[fluorine]].  The most common use has traditionally been in [[fire suppression]] systems.&lt;ref name="Chambers4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fluorine in Organic Chemistry|first=Richard D.|last=Chambers|page=4|publisher=CRC Press|year=2004|isbn= 0849317908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XE5VHh7uL_0C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Bromofluorocarbon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p2dQUvapFpin4AO8lIHgDQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bromofluorocarbon&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The brand name "Halon" is frequently used interchangeably for BFCs.  However, not all Halons are technically BFCs (some contain chlorine also).

BFCs attack the [[ozone layer]] even more aggressively than [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Geochemistry: Principles and Applications|first=Kula C.|last=Misra|chapter=13.3.1 Depletion of stratospheriz ozon -- the "ozone hole"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxG5OxwbSZcC&amp;pg=PT725&amp;dq=Bromofluorocarbon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p2dQUvapFpin4AO8lIHgDQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bromofluorocarbon&amp;f=false|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, BFCs are still used in some ships and aircraft, because replacements are not as effective.  As production of BFCs was banned by the [[Montreal Protocol]],&lt;ref name="Chambers4"/&gt; remaining use depends on old inventories and on recycling.&lt;ref name="Fire suppresion substitutes"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5744&amp;page=1|chapter=Executive summary|title=Fire suppression substitutes and alternatives to Halon for U.S. Navy applications|page=1|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-309-07492-6|author=((Committee on Assessment of Fire Suppression Substitutes and Alternatives to Halon (Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications, National Research Council)))}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BFCs are extremely inert.  In a fire, in addition to physically excluding oxygen, the molecules liberate bromine [[radical (chemistry)|radical]]s which interfere with [[combustion]] reactions.  BFCs tend to have higher melting and boiling points than comparable fully fluorinated molecules.

According to the [[UK]]'s [[Committee on Climate Change]], overvaluing companies that produce fossil fuels and greenhouse gases poses a serious threat to the economy. The committee warned the British government and [[Bank of England]] of the risks of the carbon bubble in 2014.&lt;ref name=MPcommittee /&gt; The following year, [[Mark Carney]], the Governor of the Bank of England, in his lecture to [[Lloyd's of London]], warned that limiting global warming to 2&amp;nbsp;°C appears to require that the "vast majority" of fossil fuel reserves be "[[stranded asset]]s", or "literally unburnable without expensive carbon-capture technology", resulting in "potentially huge" exposure to investors in that sector.  He concluded that "the [[window of opportunity]] is finite and shrinking" for responding to the threat that climate change poses to financial resilience and longer-term prosperity, which he called the "tragedy of the horizon".&lt;ref name=Carney&gt;{{cite report| title=Breaking the tragedy of the horizon - climate change and financial stability | author=Mark Carney | publisher=[[Bank of England]] | url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/844.aspx | date=29 September 2015 | accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, the [[Prudential Regulation Authority (United Kingdom)|Prudential Regulation Authority]] of the Bank of England issued a report discussing the risks and opportunities that climate change presents to the insurance industry.&lt;ref name=PRA&gt;{{cite report| title=The impact of climate change on the UK insurance sector | author= | publisher=[[Bank of England]] | url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Documents/supervision/activities/pradefra0915.pdf | date=September 2015 | accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech announcing his denial of the proposal to build the [[Keystone XL]] oil pipeline, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] gave as one reason for the decision "... ultimately, if we’re going to prevent large parts of this Earth from becoming not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes,  we’re going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground...".&lt;ref name=Obama&gt;{{cite speech| title=Statement by the President on the Keystone XL Pipeline | author=Barack Obama | publisher=The [[White House]] | url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/06/statement-president-keystone-xl-pipeline | date=6 November 2015 | accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McKibbon&gt;{{cite news| title=Exxon, Keystone, and the turn against fossil fuels | author=[[Bill McKibben]] | work=[[The New Yorker]] | publisher=[[Condé Nast]] | url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/exxon-keystone-and-the-turning-tide-on-fossil-fuels | date=6 November 2015 | accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beer&gt;{{cite news| title=Keystone XL pundits miss obvious reason why Obama rejected pipeline project | author=Mitchell Beer | work=[[National Observer (Canada)|National Observer]] | publisher=[[Observer Media Group]] | url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2015/11/10/opinion/keystone-xl-pundits-miss-obvious-reason-why-obama-rejected-pipeline-project | date=10 November 2015 | accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "carbon bubble" arose in the early 21st century from the increasing awareness of the impact of fossil fuel combustion on global temperatures.  The term was coined by the [[Carbon Tracker Initiative]] which published key reports in July 2011 and April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbontracker.org/carbonbubble ''Unburnable Carbon – Are the world’s financial markets carrying a carbon bubble?''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818040622/http://www.carbontracker.org/carbonbubble |date=18 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbontracker.org/wastedcapital ''Unburnable carbon 2013: Wasted capital and stranded assets''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162257/http://www.carbontracker.org/wastedcapital |date=30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was further popularised in the [[New Scientist]] magazine in October 2011.&lt;ref name="newscientist"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21031-carbon-bubble-could-threaten-markets-maybe/ |title=Carbon Bubble Could Threaten Markets | date=11 October 2011 |publisher=[[New Scientist]] | accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A widely shared article by [[Bill McKibben]] was published in [[Rolling Stone]] magazine in July 2012, bringing the idea to the attention of a popular audience.&lt;ref name="rollingstone"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719 |title=Global Warming's Terrifying New Math | date=11 October 2011 |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] | accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These were followed later in 2013 by a report from the [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] think tank.&lt;ref name=Demos&gt;{{cite report
|url=http://www.demos.org/news/beware-carbon-bubble
|title= Beware of the Carbon Bubble | last1=McElwee | first1=Sean | last2=Daly | first2=Lew

== Value ==
Author [[Bill McKibben]] has estimated that to sustain human life in the world, up to $20&amp;nbsp;trillion worth of fossil fuel reserves will need to remain in the ground.&lt;ref name=TomDispatch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175499/ |title=Why the Energy-Industrial Elite Has It In for the Planet |author=Bill McKibben |date=7 February 2012 |publisher=TomDispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stern report]] in 2006 stated that the benefits of strong, early action to decrease the use of oil, coal and gas considerably outweigh the costs. Fossil fuel contributors, the building industry, and land use practices ignore the responsibility of the external costs and ignore the [[polluter pays principle]] according to which climate change costs will be paid by historical climate polluters.

== Prospects for orderly bubble deflation ==
A planned and orderly transition away from dependence on fossil fuels could prevent a disruptive "bursting of the carbon bubble".  A number of developments are supporting such a transition.

*Government action on climate change
:A detailed academic study of the consequences for the producers of the various hydrocarbon fuels concluded in early 2015 that a third of global oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves should remain underground from 2010 to 2050 in order to meet the target of no more than a 2&amp;nbsp;°C rise in [[average global temperature]]. Hence continued exploration or development of reserves would be extraneous to needs. To meet the 2&amp;nbsp;°C target, strong measures would be needed to suppress demand, such as a substantial carbon tax leaving a lower price for the producers from a smaller market. The impact on producers would vary widely depending on the cost of production in their areas of operation.  For example, the impact in Canada would be far larger than in the U.S. Open-pit mining of [[bituminous sands]] in Canada would soon drop to negligible levels after 2020 in all scenarios considered because it is considerably less economic than other methods of production.&lt;ref name=Dyer&gt;{{cite web

:In mid-2015, the [[Centre for Science and Policy]], [[University of Cambridge]] published a report assessing the risks from climate change in order to estimate the amount of resources that should be allocated to address them. The report notes that "standard economic estimates of the global costs of climate change are wildly sensitive both to assumptions about the science, and to judgments about the value of human life. They are also likely to be systematically biased towards underestimation of risk, as they tend to omit a wide range of impacts that are difficult to quantify".&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;

*Awareness in the financial industry
:By 2013, there was significant awareness in the financial industry of the risks associated with exposure to companies involved in extraction of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=Randall&gt;{{cite web|last=Randall|first=Tom|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-18/oil-s-future-draws-blood-and-gore-in-investment-portfolios.html|title=Oil's Future Draws Blood and Gore in Investment Portfolios|publisher=Bloomberg|date= 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2014, the [[FTSE Group]], [[BlackRock]] and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] collaborated in the creation of a [[stock market index]] series that excludes companies linked to exploration, ownership or extraction of carbon-based fossil fuel reserves. These indices are intended to make it easier for investors to steer their investments away from such companies.&lt;ref name=Indices&gt;{{cite news| title=Fossil Fuel-Free Index Will Help Investors Manage Climate Risks | author=Mike Scott | publisher=[[Forbes]] | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2014/05/01/fossil-fuel-free-index-will-help-investors-manage-climate-risks/ | date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Paton&gt;{{cite news | last=Paton|first=James | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-06/australia-wind-energy-cheaper-than-coal-natural-gas-bnef-says.html|title=Australian Wind Energy Now Cheaper Than Coal, Gas, BNEF Says|publisher=Bloomberg|date= 7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that companies be required by law to report on their greenhouse gas emissions and assess the risk this could pose to their future financial performance. According to [[Christiana Figueres]], UNFCCC, companies have a duty to shareholders to move to a [[low-carbon economy]], because of the effects of the carbon bubble.&lt;ref name=MPcommittee /&gt;

*Cancellation of government energy subsidies
:According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], governments around the world gave $523&amp;nbsp;billion direct subsidies for fossil fuels in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewea.org/news/detail/?cHash=00cc30e056e10baf3a1d2b460271f233&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=2048 EWEA Blog: Global fossil fuel subsidies amount to $1.9 trillion – IMF], EWEA, 5 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; If a carbon tax of $25 per ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is included the subsidies total $1.9&amp;nbsp;trillion only for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr1393.htm IMF Calls for Global Reform of Energy Subsidies: Sees Major Gains for Economic Growth and the Environment], IMF, 27 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Removing fossil fuels subsidies will further reduce their consumption and make the alternative energies even more competitive.

*Renewable corporations lobbying
:As the penetration of the renewable energy increases so will the wealth of the renewable energy corporations. This and the increasing number of employees in the renewable energy sector will inevitably transform into political lobbying against fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poole|first=Lauren|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/05/beyond-the-ptc-wind-energys-future |title=Beyond the PTC – Wind Energy's Future|publisher=Renewable Energy World|date= 9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Urbanization and Electric transportation
:[[Urbanization]] combined with increasing availability of convenient, safe and efficient [[public transport]], [[green building]]s and efficient energy distribution, as well as extended product life/use/re-use, increased local recycling and self-sustainability in raw materials drive down energy consumption. Perversely, ready access to travel and luxury, more batteries (energy storage and conversion losses) and proliferation of low cost LED technology, e.g. for advertising and decorative uses, may negate some of the potential energy savings. Switching to renewables sourced, [[Electric vehicle|electricity based transportation]] will reduce the demand for fossil fuels, particularly petroleum.&lt;ref name=CarbonTracker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cleantechnica.com/2013/07/23/peak-oil-less-a-concern-as-alternatives-reduce-demand "Peak Oil" Less A Concern As Alternatives Reduce Demand], Cleantechnica, 23 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Combining roof photovoltaics with second hand EV batteries will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels as they will provide the needed [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] for the times when the [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent]] renewable energy sources are not producing electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2012/Nov/electrification/1114_reuse.html GM, ABB Demonstrate Chevrolet Volt Battery Reuse Unit], General Motors, 11 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

*Innovation and Efficiency
:Innovations in, for example, information technology, miniaturisation, LEDs, virtual reality, 3D printing, new materials and biotechnology enable energy reduction in the areas of human sustenance and travel, as well as physical product creation and distribution. They also offer new avenues for economic growth and technological leadership, and are thus especially important for sustained wealth creation in the most developed, net-energy importing nations. Energy consumption may be expected to decrease as the service sector of the economy continues to grow whilst heavy industry, construction, manufacturing and agricultural sectors reduce. Increased investments in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] may lead to less consumed energy&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/amorylovins/2014/07/18/energy-intensity-the-secret-revolution/ Energy Intensity: The Secret Revolution], Forbes,  18 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; even when the economy grows.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/01/17/1745542/energy-is-gradually-decoupling-from-economic-growth/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119073009/http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/01/17/1745542/energy-is-gradually-decoupling-from-economic-growth/ |archive-date=19 January 2014 |dead-url=yes |title=Energy is gradually decoupling from economic growth &amp;#124; FT Alphaville |date=17 January 2014 |accessdate=10 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without growth in energy usage the prices of fossil fuels will decrease and most of the mega energy projects may be uneconomical.

*Demographics and Changes in consumer behavior
:A shrinking and ageing, already materially prosperous, satisfied and individualistic society may be less motivated towards additional, energy consuming material goods and new construction. On the other hand, longer life expectancy and increasing leisure and travel time will increase total energy use over an individual's lifetime. According to research by U.S. PIRG Education Fund reported in late 2014: "Over the last decade – after 60-plus years of steady increases – the number of miles driven by the average American has been falling. Young Americans have experienced the greatest changes: driving less; taking public transport, biking and walking more; and seeking out places to live in cities and walkable communities where driving is an option, not a necessity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/millennials-motion MILLENNIALS IN MOTION], U.S. PIRG Education Fund, 14 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] show that U.S. consumption of both coal and petroleum liquids peaked in 2005, and at the end of 2014 had fallen by 21% and 13% respectively. Consumption of natural gas continued to climb, resulting in the rate of total fossil fuel consumption in terms of energy units falling only 6% from its peak in 2007 to a plateau. On the other hand, global consumption of petroleum climbed steadily a total of 32% from 1995 to 2014.&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite report

'''Casa Grande Ruins National Monument''' ({{lang-ood|'''Siwañ Waʼa Ki:'''}} or ''Sivan Vahki''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the Gila River Water Settlement Act of 2004, Chapter 1: Roots |url=http://gilariver.com/lessons/Water%20Settlement%20Chapter%201.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in [[Coolidge, Arizona]], just northeast of the city of [[Casa Grande, Arizona|Casa Grande]], preserves a group of [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]] [[Hohokam]] structures of the [[Pueblo III Era|Pueblo III]] and [[Pueblo IV Era]]s.

==Ancient pueblos==
The [[U.S. National Monument|national monument]] consists of the [[ruins]] of multiple structures surrounded by a compound wall constructed by the ancient people of the Hohokam period, who farmed the [[Gila River|Gila Valley]] in the early 13th century. "Archeologists have discovered evidence that the ancient Sonoran Desert people who built the Casa Grande also developed wide-scale irrigation farming and extensive trade connections which lasted over a thousand years until about 1450 C.E."&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |title=Casa Grande Ruins: History &amp; Culture |publisher=National Park Service |url=http://www.nps.gov/cagr/historyculture/index.htm |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Casa Grande" is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "big house" (''Siwañ Wa'a Ki:'' in [[O'odham language|O'odham]]); these names refer to the largest structure on the site, which is what remains of a four-story structure that may have been abandoned by 1450. The structure is made of [[Caliche (Mineral)|caliche]], and has managed to survive the extreme weather conditions for about seven centuries. The large house consists of outer rooms surrounding an inner structure. The outer rooms are all three stories high, while the inner structure is four stories high. The structures were constructed using traditional adobe processes. The wet adobe is thicker at the base and adds significant strength. Noticeable horizontal cracks define the breaks between courses on the thick outer walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dean R. Snow|year=2010|title=Archaeology of Native North America|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process consisted of using damp adobe to form the walls and then waiting for it to dry, and then building it up with more adobe. Casa Grande contained a ball court much like that found at [[Pueblo Grande de Nevada]]. Father [[Eusebio Kino]] was the first European to view the Hohokam complex in November 1694 and named it Casa Grande.&lt;ref name=Pompeii&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= An American Pompeii Unearthed in Arizona |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4768055// |newspaper=The Washington, D.C.

Casa Grande now has a distinctive modern roof covering built in 1932.

==Administrative history==
In 1891, the monument underwent repairs supervised by [[Cosmos Mindeleff]] of the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], until funds ran out. Proclaimed '''Casa Grande Reservation''' by [[s:Executive Order 28-A|Executive Order 28-A]] of President [[Benjamin Harrison]] on June 22, 1892, Casa Grande Ruins became the first prehistoric and cultural reserve in the US. It was then re-designated a national monument by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] on August 3, 1918.  As with all historical areas administered by the [[National Park Service]], Casa Grande was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966.

==Historic adobes==
Between 1937 and 1940 the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] built several adobe buildings to serve as housing and administrative offices for the national monument.  The adobe buildings, constructed using traditional methods, continue in use today and are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Because of careful conservation, the physical appearance of Casa Grande Ruins has hardly changed since the 1940s.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Olmsted shelter==
In 1932, a [[Ramada (shelter)|ramada]] to shelter the ruins from weathering was built by Boston architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The current protective structure covering the "Great House" replaced a wooden similar structure built to protect it in 1903
. Due to the fragile nature of the "Great House," visitors to the site are not permitted inside. To protect its integrity, observation by visitors is only permitted outside the structure.

[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] '''Charles Clerke''' (22 August 1741 – 22 August 1779) was an officer in the [[Royal Navy]] who sailed on four voyages of exploration, 3 with Captain [[James Cook]].  When Cook was killed during his [[Third voyage of James Cook|3rd expedition to the Pacific]], Clerke took command but died later in the voyage from [[tuberculosis]].

==Biography==
Clerke started studying at the [[Royal Naval Academy]] in [[Portsmouth]] when he was 13.  During the [[Seven Years' War]] he served aboard [[HMS Dorsetshire (1757)|HMS ''Dorsetshire '']] and [[HMS Bellona (1760)|HMS ''Bellona'']]. He was in the [[mizzen]]-top of HMS Bellona when the mast was shot away in 1761 and he became the only survivor of those who consequently fell overboard.&lt;ref&gt;''The Captain Cook Encyclopædia'', p. 61. John Robson. Random House Australia. {{ISBN|0-7593-1011-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1764 he joined [[Post Captain|Captain]] [[John Byron]], aboard [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS ''Dolphin'']], on Byron's expedition to explore the Pacific.  The Dolphin returned in May 1766. Its circumnavigation of 22 months was the shortest up to that point. Upon his return Clerke published an account of encountering [[Patagonia]]n giants, a hoax which the [[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] attributed to his high spirits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=1811 biography] from the [[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clerke's last three voyages were all under the command of Captain [[James Cook]].  He started the [[First voyage of James Cook|first voyage]] aboard [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']] (1768–1771) as a [[master's mate]].  Cook promoted him to acting [[lieutenant]] in 1771, and he was officially confirmed in that rank on 31 July 1771. He was [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS ''Resolution'']]'s second lieutenant on [[Second voyage of James Cook|Cook's second voyage]] (1772–1775).

While ashore between Cook's 2nd and [[Third voyage of James Cook|3rd voyages]] Clerke agreed to serve time in the [[King's Bench Prison|King's Bench]] [[debtor's prison]] for a debt one of his brothers, Sir John Clerke had incurred.  While in debtor's prison he was infected with the tuberculosis that eventually killed him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Captain Cook Encyclopædia'', p. 62. John Robson. Random House Australia. {{ISBN|0-7593-1011-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Charles Clerke | year=1779 | title=Letter to Joseph Banks 10 August 1779 | publisher= State Library of New South Wales, Sydney | url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/banks/section-04/series-11/11-04-letter-received-by-banks-from-charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Камчатка2.jpg|thumb|left|The grave of Charles Clerke (on the right) in the centre of the city Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]]

For Cook's third expedition, Clerke was placed in command of [[HMS Discovery (1774)|HMS ''Discovery'']], receiving this command on 26 August 1775.  When Cook was killed in a skirmish with [[Hawaii]]ans on 14 February 1779, Clerke took command of the expedition and of HMS ''Resolution''.  He continued the expedition's exploration of the Northern Pacific coast, searching for a navigable [[Northwest Passage]].  The expedition then proceeded to the Pacific coast of Siberia.  Lieutenant [[James King (Royal Navy officer)|James King]], one of his subordinates, wrote that Clerke's illness had reduced him to skeletal thinness. On 10 August 1779, Clerke wrote in a letter to [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] that, "The disorder I was attacked with in the King's bench prison has proved consumptive, with which I have battled with various [unclear] although without one single days health since I took leave of you ... it has now so far got the better of me that I am not able to turn myself in bed, so that my stay in this world must be of very short duration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Charles Clerke | year=1779 | title=Letter to Joseph Banks 10 August 1779 | publisher= State Library of New South Wales, Sydney | url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/banks/section-04/series-11/11-04-letter-received-by-banks-from-charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clerke died from tuberculosis on his 38th birthday (22 August 1779) en route to [[Kamchatka]] from the [[Bering Strait]].  He was buried in Kamchatka on 29 August 1779.  Clerke's second in command, Lieutenant [[John Gore (Royal Navy captain)|John Gore]] took command of the expedition as captain of ''Resolution,'' appointing King as captain of ''Discovery.'' The expedition then sailed via China and the [[Sunda Strait]] to [[Cape Town]], returning to England in August 1780.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =Captain Cook in the Pacific | first =Nigel | last =Rigby |author2=Pieter van der Merwe | year =2002 | publisher =National Maritime Museum, UK | page =61| isbn =0948065435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, the [[British Admiralty]] erected a small [[obelisk]] in Clerke's honour at [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy]], Russia, with an inscription in English.&lt;ref&gt;''The Captain Cook Encyclopædia'', p. 62.

In [[cartography]], a '''conformal map projection''' is one in which any angle on Earth (a [[sphere]] or an [[ellipsoid]]) is preserved in the image of the projection, i.e. the projection is a [[conformal map]] in the mathematical sense.

== Properties ==
We can define a conformal projection as one that is locally conformal at any point on the earth. Thus, any small figure on the earth is nearly similar to its image on the map. The projection preserves the ratio of two lengths in the small domain. All [[Tissot's indicatrices]] of the projections are circles.

Conformal projections preserve only small figures. Large figures are distorted, even by conformal projections.

In a conformal projection, any small figure is similar to the image, but the ratio of similarity ([[Scale (map)|scale]]) varies by location. This explains the distortion of the conformal projection.

In a conformal projection, [[Circle of latitude|parallels]] and [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] cross rectangularly on the map. The converse is not necessarily true. The counterexamples are equirectangular and equal-area cylindrical projections (of normal aspects). These projections expand meridian-wise and parallel-wise by different ratios respectively. Thus, parallels and meridians cross rectangularly on the map, but these projections do not preserve other angles; i.e. these projections are not conformal.

*[[Lambert conformal conic projection]]
**Oblique conformal conic projection (This projection is sometimes used for long-shaped regions, like as continents of [[Americas]] or [[Japanese archipelago]].)

== Applications ==
=== Large scale ===
Many large-scale maps use conformal projections because figures in large-scale maps can be regarded as small enough. The figures on the maps are nearly similar to their physical counterparts.

A non-conformal projection can be used in a limited domain such that the projection is locally conformal. Glueing many maps together restores roundness. To make a new sheet from many maps or to change the center, the body must be re-projected.

Seamless online maps can be very large [[Mercator projection|Mercator projections]], so that any place can become the map's center, then the map remains conformal. However, it is difficult to compare lengths or areas of two far-off figures using such a projection.

The [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system]] and the [[:fr:Projection conique conforme de Lambert#Lambert zone|Lambert system]] in France are projections that support the trade-off between seamlessness and scale variability.

=== For small scale ===
[[File:GS-50 projection with lines of constant scale.svg|thumb|A contour chart of scale factors of GS50 projection]]

Maps reflecting directions, such as a [[nautical chart]] or an [[aeronautical chart]], are projected by conformal projections. Maps treating values whose gradients are important, such as a [[weather map]] with [[atmospheric pressure]], are also projected by conformal projections.

Small scale maps have large scale variations in a conformal projection, so recent world maps use other projections. Historically, many world maps are drawn by conformal projections, such as Mercator maps or hemisphere maps by [[stereographic projection]].

Conformal maps containing large regions vary scales by locations, so it is difficult to compare lengths or areas. However, some techniques require that a length of 1 degree on a meridian = 111&amp;nbsp;km = 60 [[nautical mile]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. In non-conformal maps, such techniques are not available because the same lengths at a point vary the lengths on the map.

In Mercator or stereographic projections, scales vary by [[latitude]], so bar scales by latitudes are often appended. In complex projections such as of oblique aspect. Contour charts of scale factors are sometimes appended.

'''Datun Sahib''' is the name of a tree in the main bazaar at [[Leh]], [[Ladakh]] in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], India. [[Guru Nanak]] visited this site around 1516. There is no [[Gurudwara]] at the site, but the remains of a large [[meswak]] tree are located behind the Jamia Masjid in the main bazaar at Leh. The Datun Sahib is located close to the Leh Palace, on a lane which mainly houses bread makers. 

Datun Sahib contains a nishan sahib and a tree wrapped with orange cloth. A yellow board in front of the tree refers to the visit of [[Rimpoche Nanak]] (Holy Nanak) around 1516. Guru Nanak was revered by both [[Buddhist]]s and [[Muslim]]s. It is said that Leh was devoid of greenery at the time, but Nanak blessed the city with greenery by planting a meswak tree. There are two main Singh Sabha Gurudwaras located within one kilometre of the site.

Methods of '''hydrogen storage''' for subsequent use span many approaches including high pressures, cryogenics, and chemical compounds that reversibly release H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon heating. [[Underground hydrogen storage]] is useful to provide [[grid energy storage]] for [[intermittent energy source]]s, like [[wind power]], as well as providing fuel for transportation, particularly for ships and airplanes.

Most research into hydrogen storage is focused on storing hydrogen as a lightweight, compact [[energy carrier]] for [[Hydrogen vehicle|mobile applications]].

[[Liquid hydrogen]] or [[slush hydrogen]] may be used, as in the [[Space Shuttle]]. However liquid hydrogen requires [[cryogenic]] storage and boils around 20.268 [[Kelvin|K]] (−252.882&amp;nbsp;°C or −423.188&amp;nbsp;°F). Hence, its [[liquefaction]] imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature). The tanks must also be well insulated to prevent [[Boiling point|boil off]] but adding insulation increases cost. Liquid hydrogen has less [[energy density]] ''by volume'' than [[hydrocarbon]] fuels such as [[gasoline]] by approximately a factor of four. This highlights the density problem for pure hydrogen: there is actually about 64% more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116&amp;nbsp;grams hydrogen) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71&amp;nbsp;grams hydrogen). The carbon in the gasoline also contributes to the energy of combustion.

[[Compressed hydrogen]], by comparison, is stored quite differently. Hydrogen gas has good [[Energies per unit mass|energy density by weight]], but poor energy density by volume versus hydrocarbons, hence it requires a larger tank to store. A large [[hydrogen tank]] will be heavier than the small hydrocarbon tank used to store the same amount of energy, all other factors remaining equal. Increasing gas pressure would improve the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not lighter container tanks (see [[hydrogen tank]]). Compressed hydrogen costs 2.1% of the energy content&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080307082839/http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2005/hydrogen2005.pdf Energy technology analysis]. International Energy Agency (2005) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; to power the compressor. Higher compression without [[energy recovery]] will mean more energy lost to the compression step. Compressed hydrogen storage can exhibit very low [[permeation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://h2storage.net/docs/pdf/29/s4/makarov.pdf |title=Modeling of dispersion following hydrogen permeation for safety engineering and risk assessment |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142016/http://h2storage.net/docs/pdf/29/s4/makarov.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-23 |conference=II International Conference "Hydrogen Storage Technologies" Moscow, Russia, 28–29 October 2009 |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Established technologies==
[[File:Storage Density of Hydrogen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Net storage density of hydrogen]]

=== Compressed hydrogen ===

Compressed hydrogen is a storage form where hydrogen gas is kept under pressures to increase the storage density. Compressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for hydrogen tank systems in vehicles, based on type IV carbon-composite technology.&lt;ref name=store&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure: status 2012|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=8780 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987484 |last1=Eberle |first1=Ulrich |first2=Bernd |last2=Mueller |first3=Rittmar |last3=von Helmolt |accessdate=2014-12-19 |doi=10.1039/C2EE22596D |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Car manufacturers have been developing this solution, such as Honda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.honda.com/FCXClarity/package/index.html |website=Honda Worldwide |title=FCX Clarity |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Nissan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/TECHNOLOGY/INTRODUCTION/DETAILS/XTRAIL-FCV/index.html |title=X-TRAIL FCV '03 model |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917105718/http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/TECHNOLOGY/INTRODUCTION/DETAILS/XTRAIL-FCV/index.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |website=Nissan-global.com |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liquid hydrogen ===

BMW has been working on [[liquid hydrogen]] tanks for cars, producing for example the [[BMW Hydrogen 7]]. Japan have liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage at a tanker port in Kobe, and are anticipated to receive the first shipment of liquid hydrogen via LH2 carrier in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savvides|first1=Nick|title=Japan plans to use imported liquefied hydrogen to fuel Tokyo 2020 Olympics|url=https://fairplay.ihs.com/ship-construction/article/4280251/japan-plans-to-use-imported-liquefied-hydrogen-to-fuel-tokyo-2020-olympics |website=Fairplay|publisher=IHS Markit Maritime Portal|accessdate=22 April 2018|date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen is liquified by reducing its temperature to -253°C, similar to liquified natural gas (LNG) which is stored at -162°C. A potential efficiency loss of 12.79% can be achieved, or 4.26kWh/kg out of 33.3kWh/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sadaghiani |first1=Mirhadi S. |title=Introducing and energy analysis of a novel cryogenic hydrogen liquefaction process configuration|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|date=2 March 2017 |volume=42 |issue=9 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals and research==
Hydrogen storage technologies can be divided into physical storage, where hydrogen molecules are stored (including pure hydrogen storage via compression and liquefaction), and chemical storage, where hydrides are stored.

===Chemical storage===
Chemical storage could offer high storage performance due to the strong binding of hydrogen and the high storage densities. However, the regeneration of storage material is still an issue. A large number of chemical storage systems are under investigation, which involve [[hydrolysis]] reactions, [[hydrogenation]]/dehydrogenation reactions, [[ammonia borane]] and other [[boron hydride]]s, ammonia, and [[Aluminium hydride|alane]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The U.S. Department of Energy's National Hydrogen Storage Project: Progress towards meeting hydrogen-powered vehicle requirements|last = Sunita|first = Satyapal|date = 2007|journal = Catalysis Today|doi = 10.1016/j.cattod.2006.09.022|pmid = |access-date =|volume=120|issue = 3–4|pages=246–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Storage in hydrocarbons may also be successful in overcoming the issue with low density.  For example, supercritical hydrogen at 30&amp;nbsp;°C and 500 bar only has a density of 15.0&amp;nbsp;mol/L while [[methanol]] has a density of 49.5&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L methanol and saturated [[dimethyl ether]] at 30&amp;nbsp;°C and 7 bar has a density of 42.1&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L dimethyl ether.  These liquids would use much smaller, cheaper, safer storage tanks.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The most promising chemical approach is electrochemical hydrogen storage, as the release of hydrogen can be controlled by the applied electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319917333529|title = Electrochemical hydrogen storage: Opportunities for fuel storage, batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors|last1 = Eftekhari|first1 = Ali|last2 = Baizeng| first2=Fang|date = 2017|journal = International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|doi = 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.08.103|pmid = |access-date =|volume=42|issue = 40|pages=25143–25165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the materials listed below can be directly used for electrochemical hydrogen storage.

==== Metal hydrides ====
[[Image:Metal hydride hydrogen.storage.graph.gif|thumb|upright=1.25|Metal hydride hydrogen storage]]
[[Metal hydrides]], such as [[Magnesium hydride|MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Sodium aluminium hydride|NaAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium aluminum hydride|LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium hydride|LiH]], [[LaNi5H6|LaNi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[TiFeH2|TiFeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[palladium hydride]], with varying degrees of efficiency, can be used as a storage medium for hydrogen, often reversibly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/storage/metal_hydrides.html DOE Metal hydrides]. eere.energy.gov (2008-12-19). Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are easy-to-fuel liquids at ambient temperature and pressure, others are solids which could be turned into pellets. These materials have good [[energy density]], although their [[specific energy]] is often worse than the leading [[hydrocarbon]] fuels.

Most metal hydrides bind with hydrogen very strongly. As a result, high temperatures around 120&amp;nbsp;°C (248&amp;nbsp;°F) – 200&amp;nbsp;°C (392&amp;nbsp;°F) are required to release their hydrogen content. This energy cost can be reduced by using alloys which consists of a strong hydride former and a weak one such as in [[Lithium amide|LiNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[lithium borohydride|LiBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[sodium borohydride|NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Christian|first1= Meganne|last2= Aguey-Zinsou|first2= Kondo François|year= 2012|title= Core–Shell Strategy Leading to High Reversible Hydrogen Storage Capacity for NaBH4|journal= [[ACS Nano]]|volume= 6|issue= 9|pages= 7739–7751|doi=10.1021/nn3030018 |pmid= 22873406}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are able to form weaker bonds, thereby requiring less input to release stored hydrogen. However, if the interaction is too weak, the pressure needed for rehydriding is high, thereby eliminating any energy savings. The target for onboard hydrogen fuel systems is roughly &lt;100&amp;nbsp;°C for release and &lt;700 bar for recharge (20–60 kJ/mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/pdf/efchp_hydrogen3.pdf EU Hydrogen Storage]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative method for reducing dissociation temperatures is doping with activators. This has been successfully used for [[aluminium hydride]] but its complex synthesis makes it undesirable for most applications as it is not easily recharged with hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Graetz | first1 = J. | last2 = Reilly | first2 = J. | last3 = Sandrock | first3 = G. | last4 = Johnson | first4 = J. | last5 = Zhou | first5 = W.

Currently the only hydrides which are capable of achieving the 9 wt% gravimetric goal for 2015 (see chart above) are limited to lithium, boron and aluminium based compounds; at least one of the second-row elements or Al must be added. Research is being done to determine new compounds which can be used to meet these requirements.

Proposed hydrides for use in a hydrogen economy include simple hydrides of [[magnesium hydride|magnesium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://neel.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article1281 CNRS Institut Neel H2 Storage]. Neel.cnrs.fr. Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[transition metal]]s and [[complex metal hydride]]s, typically containing [[sodium]], [[lithium]], or [[calcium]] and [[aluminium]] or [[boron]]. Hydrides chosen for storage applications provide low reactivity (high safety) and high hydrogen storage densities. Leading candidates are [[lithium hydride]], [[sodium borohydride]], [[lithium aluminium hydride]] and [[ammonia borane]]. A French company McPhy Energy is developing the first industrial product, based on magnesium hydride, already sold to some major clients such as Iwatani and ENEL.

''[[New Scientist]]'' reported that [[Arizona State University]] is investigating using a [[borohydride]] solution to store hydrogen, which is released when the solution flows over a catalyst made of ruthenium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/dn10066-new-type-of-hydrogen-fuel-cell-powers-up.html | title=New type of hydrogen fuel cell powers up | publisher= newscientist | accessdate=2006-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Georgia Tech]] performed extensive benchmarking simulations on mixtures of several light metal hydrides to predict possible reaction thermodynamics for hydrogen storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Examining the robustness of first-principles calculations for metal hydride reaction thermodynamics by detection of metastable reaction pathways|author1=Ki Chul Kim |author2=Anant D.

==== Non-metal hydrides ====
The Italian [[catalyst]] manufacturer [[Acta (chemical company)|Acta]] has proposed using [[Hydrazine#Fuel cells|hydrazine as an alternative to hydrogen]] in [[fuel cell]]s. As the hydrazine fuel is liquid at room temperature, it can be handled and stored more easily than hydrogen. By storing it in a tank full of a double-bonded [[carbon]]-[[oxygen]] [[carbonyl]], it reacts and forms a safe solid called [[hydrazone]]. By then flushing the tank with warm water, the liquid hydrazine hydrate is released. Hydrazine breaks down in the cell to form [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] which bonds with oxygen, releasing water.&lt;ref name="The Engineer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/303939/Liquid+asset.htm |title=Liquid asset |work=The Engineer |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2015-01-09 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon hydrides and germanium hydrides are also candidates of hydrogen storage materials, as they can subject to energetically favored reaction to form covalently bonded dimers with loss of a hydrogen molecule.&lt;ref&gt;Zong, J., J.

International Journal of Quantum Chemistry 117.21 (2017): e25432.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carbohydrates ====
[[Carbohydrates]] (polymeric C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) releases H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a bioreformer mediated by the enzyme cocktail—cell-free synthetic pathway biotransformation. Carbohydrate provides high hydrogen storage densities as a liquid with mild pressurization and cryogenic constraints: It can also be stored as a solid powder. Carbohydrate is the most abundant renewable bioresource in the world.

In May 2007 biochemical engineers from the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] and biologists and chemists from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory announced a method of producing high-yield pure hydrogen from starch and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000456 |title=High-Yield Hydrogen Production from Starch and Water by a Synthetic Enzymatic Pathway|year=2007|editor1-last=Melis|editor1-first=Anastasios|last1=Zhang|first1=Y.-H.

Percival|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|volume=2|issue=3|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Synthesized hydrocarbons ====
An alternative to hydrides is to use regular [[hydrocarbon]] fuels as the hydrogen carrier. Then a small [[hydrogen reformer]] would extract the hydrogen as needed by the [[fuel cell]]. However, these reformers are slow to react to changes in demand and add a large incremental cost to the vehicle powertrain.

[[Direct methanol fuel cell]]s do not require a reformer, but provide a lower energy density compared to conventional fuel cells, although this could be counterbalanced with the much better energy densities of [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]] over hydrogen. [[Alcohol fuel]] is a [[renewable resource]].

[[Solid-oxide fuel cells]] can operate on light hydrocarbons such as [[propane]] and [[methane]] without a reformer, or can run on higher hydrocarbons with only partial reforming, but the high temperature and slow startup time of these fuel cells are problematic for automotive applications.

===== Aluminum =====
{{Main|Aluminum}}

[[Aluminum]] has been proposed as an [[energy storage]] method by a number of researchers. [[hydrogen]] can be extracted from aluminum by reacting it with water.&lt;ref name="Alchemy white paper"&gt;[http://www.alcres.com/docs/alydro-energy-storage.pdf White Paper: A Novel Method For Grid Energy Storage Using Aluminum Fuel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531060548/http://www.alcres.com/docs/alydro-energy-storage.pdf |date=2013-05-31 }}, Alchemy Research, April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To react with water, however, aluminum must be stripped of its natural [[oxide]] layer, a process which requires pulverization,&lt;ref name="Army"&gt;{{cite web |title=Army discovery may offer new energy source {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory |url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=3036 |website=www.arl.army.mil |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; chemical reactions with caustic substances, or alloys.&lt;ref name="Woodall"&gt;{{cite web |title=New process generates hydrogen from aluminum alloy to run engines, fuel cells |url=https://phys.org/news/2007-05-hydrogen-aluminum-alloy-fuel-cells.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The byproduct of the reaction to create hydrogen is [[aluminum oxide]], which can be recycled back into aluminum with the [[Hall–Héroult process]], making the reaction theoretically renewable.

==== Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) ====
[[File:Perhydro-N-Carbazol.PNG|right|thumb|upright=1.25|Reversible hydrogenation of N-ethylcarbazole]]
Unsaturated organic compounds can store huge amounts of hydrogen. These ''Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers'' (LOHC) are hydrogenated for storage and dehydrogenated again when the energy/hydrogen is needed. Research on LOHC was concentrated on cycloalkanes at an early stage, with its relatively high hydrogen capacity (6-8 wt %) and production of CO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-free hydrogen.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Liquid organic hydrogen carriers|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095495615000546|journal = Journal of Energy Chemistry|date = 2015-09-01|pages = 587–594|volume = 24|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.jechem.2015.08.007|first = Teng|last = He|first2 = Qijun|last2 = Pei|first3 = Ping|last3 = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Heterocyclic compounds|Heterocyclic aromatic compounds]] (or N-Heterocycles) are also appropriate for this task.

* Cycloalkanes
Cycloalkanes reported as LOHC include cyclohexane, methyl-cyclohexane and decalin.

* Formic acid
In 2006 researchers of EPFL, Switzerland, reported the use of [[formic acid]] as a hydrogen storage material.&lt;ref&gt;G. Laurenczy, C. Fellay, P. J.

==== Ammonia ====
{{Further|Ammonia production}}
[[Ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) releases H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an appropriate catalytic reformer. Ammonia provides high hydrogen storage densities as a liquid with mild pressurization and cryogenic constraints: It can also be stored as a liquid at room temperature and pressure when mixed with water. Ammonia is the second most commonly produced chemical in the world and a large infrastructure for making, transporting, and distributing ammonia exists. Ammonia can be reformed to produce hydrogen with no harmful waste, or can mix with existing fuels and under the right conditions burn efficiently. Since there is no carbon in ammonia, no carbon by-products are produced; thereby making this possibility a "carbon neutral" option for the future. Pure ammonia burns poorly at the atmospheric pressures found in natural gas fired water heaters and stoves. Under compression in an automobile engine it is a suitable fuel for slightly modified gasoline engines. Ammonia is the suitable alternative fuel because it has 18.6 MJ/kg energy density at NTP and carbon-free combustion byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AVERY|first=W|date=1988|title=A role for ammonia in the hydrogen economy|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0360319988900377|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=13|issue=12|pages=761–773|doi=10.1016/0360-3199(88)90037-7|issn=0360-3199}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ammonia is a toxic gas at normal temperature and pressure and has a potent odor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/webonly/webex710.html The ammonia economy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513030624/http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/webonly/webex710.html |date=2008-05-13 }}.

==== Amine borane complexes ====
{{Main article|Amine borane complex}}
Prior to 1980, several compounds were investigated for hydrogen storage including complex borohydrides, or aluminohydrides, and ammonium salts. These hydrides have an upper theoretical hydrogen yield limited to about 8.5% by weight. Amongst the compounds that contain only B, N, and H (both positive and negative ions), representative examples include: amine boranes, boron hydride ammoniates, hydrazine-borane complexes, and ammonium octahydrotriborates or tetrahydroborates. Of these, amine boranes (and especially [[ammonia borane]]) have been extensively investigated as hydrogen carriers. During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. Army and Navy funded efforts aimed at developing hydrogen/deuterium gas-generating compounds for use in the HF/DF and HCl chemical [[laser]]s, and gas dynamic lasers. Earlier hydrogen gas-generating formulations used amine boranes and their derivatives. Ignition of the amine borane(s) forms [[boron nitride]] (BN) and hydrogen gas. In addition to ammonia borane
(H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BNH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), other gas-generators include diborane diammoniate, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Imidazolium ionic liquids====
In 2007 [[Jairton Dupont|Dupont]] and others reported hydrogen-storage materials based on imidazolium ionic liquids. Simple alkyl(aryl)-3-methylimidazolium N-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imidate salts that possess very low vapour pressure, high density, and thermal stability and are not inflammable can add reversibly 6–12 hydrogen atoms in the presence of classical Pd/C or Ir0 nanoparticle catalysts and can be used as alternative materials for on-board hydrogen-storage devices. These salts can hold up to 30 g L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ef060481t|title=Hydrogen-Storage Materials Based on Imidazolium Ionic Liquids|year=2007|last1=Stracke|first1=Marcelo P.|last2=Ebeling|first2=Günter|last3=Cataluña|first3=Renato|last4=Dupont|first4=Jairton|journal=Energy &amp; Fuels|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1695–1698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phosphino-borane on the left accepts one equivalent of hydrogen at one atmosphere and 25&amp;nbsp;°C and expels it again by heating to 100&amp;nbsp;°C. The storage capacity is 0.25 wt% still rather below the 6 to 9 wt% required for practical use.

==== Carbonite substances ====
Research has proven that [[graphene]] can store hydrogen efficiently. After taking up hydrogen, the substance becomes [[graphane]]. After tests, conducted by dr André Geim at the [[University of Manchester]], it was shown that not only can graphene store hydrogen easily, it can also release the hydrogen again, after heating to 450&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22689 Graphene as suitable hydrogen storage substance].

====Metal-organic frameworks====
[[Metal-organic framework]]s represent another class of synthetic porous materials that store hydrogen and energy at the molecular level. MOFs are highly crystalline inorganic-organic hybrid structures that contain metal clusters or ions (secondary building units) as nodes and organic ligands as linkers. When guest molecules (solvent) occupying the pores are removed during solvent exchange and heating under vacuum, porous structure of MOFs can be achieved without destabilizing the frame and hydrogen molecules will be adsorbed onto the surface of the pores by physisorption. Compared to traditional zeolites and porous carbon materials, MOFs have very high number of pores and surface area which allow higher hydrogen uptake in a given volume. Thus, research interests on hydrogen storage in MOFs have been growing since 2003 when the first MOF-based hydrogen storage was introduced. Since there are infinite geometric and chemical variations of MOFs based on different combinations of SBUs and linkers, many researches explore what combination will provide the maximum hydrogen uptake by varying materials of metal ions and linkers.

In 2006, chemists at [[UCLA]] and the [[University of Michigan]] have achieved hydrogen storage concentrations of up to 7.5 wt% in MOF-74 at a low temperature of 77 [[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/techbeat/tb2008_0401.htm#hydrogen MOF-74 – A Potential Hydrogen-Storage Compound].

Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, researchers at [[University of Nottingham]] reached 10 wt% at 77 bar (1,117 psi) and 77 K with MOF NOTT-112.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/02/new-mof-materia.html New MOF Material With hydrogen Uptake Of Up To 10 wt%]. 22 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most articles about hydrogen storage in MOFs report hydrogen uptake capacity at a temperature of 77K and a pressure of 1 bar because these conditions are commonly available and the binding energy between hydrogen and the MOF at this temperature is large compared to the thermal vibration energy. Varying several factors such as surface area, pore size, catenation, ligand structure, and sample purity can result in different amounts of hydrogen uptake in MOFs.

====Encapsulation====
[[Cella Energy]] technology is based around the encapsulation of hydrogen gas and nano-structuring of chemical hydrides in small plastic balls, at room temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cellaenergy.com Cella Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical storage===

In this case hydrogen remains in physical forms, i.e., as gas, supercritical fluid, adsorbate, or molecular inclusions. Theoretical limitations and experimental results are considered &lt;ref&gt;Compendium of Hydrogen Energy.Volume 2:hydrogen Storage, Transportation and Infrastructure.

==== Activated carbons ====
Activated carbons are highly porous amorphous carbon materials with high apparent surface area. Hydrogen [[physisorption]] can be increased in these materials by increasing the apparent surface area and optimizing pore diameter to around 7 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sevilla|first=Marta|last2=Mokaya|first2=Robert|date=2014-03-21|title=Energy storage applications of activated carbons: supercapacitors and hydrogen storage|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C3EE43525C|journal=Energy Environ.

====Cryo-compressed====

Cryo-compressed storage of hydrogen is the only technology that meets 2015 DOE targets for volumetric and gravimetric efficiency (see "CcH2" on slide 6 in &lt;ref name="hydrogen.energy.gov"/&gt;).

Furthermore, another study has shown that cryo-compressed exhibits interesting cost advantages: ownership cost (price per mile) and storage system cost (price per vehicle) are actually the lowest when compared to any other technology (see third row in slide 13 of &lt;ref&gt;Stephen Lasher [http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review10/st002_lasher_2010_o_web.pdf Analyses of Hydrogen Storage Materials and On-Board Systems]. DOE Annual Merit Review June 7–11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, a cryo-compressed hydrogen system would cost $0.12 per mile (including cost of fuel and every associated other cost), while conventional gasoline vehicles cost between $0.05 and $0.07 per mile.

Like liquid storage, cryo-compressed uses cold hydrogen (20.3 K and slightly above) in order to reach a high energy density. However, the main difference is that, when the hydrogen would warm-up due to heat transfer with the environment ("boil off"), the tank is allowed to go to pressures much higher (up to 350 bars versus a couple of bars for liquid storage). As a consequence, it takes more time before the hydrogen has to vent, and in most driving situations, enough hydrogen is used by the car to keep the pressure well below the venting limit.

Consequently, it has been demonstrated that a high driving range could be achieved with a cryo-compressed tank : more than {{convert|650|mi|km}} were driven with a full tank mounted on an hydrogen-fueled engine of [[Toyota Prius]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.llnl.gov/str/June07/Aceves.html S&amp;TR | Setting a World Driving Record with Hydrogen].

====Carbon nanotubes====
[[Image:Carbon nanotubes.jpg|thumb|upright|Carbon nanotubes]]

Hydrogen carriers based on nanostructured carbon (such as carbon [[fullerene|buckyballs]] and [[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]]) have been proposed. However, since Hydrogen usually amounts up to ~3.0-7.0 wt% at 77K which is far from the value set by US department of Energy (6 wt% at nearly ambient conditions), it makes carbon materials poor candidates for hydrogen storage.

====Clathrate hydrates====
[[hydrogen clathrate|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; caged]] in a [[clathrate hydrate]] was first reported in 2002, but requires very high pressures to be stable. In 2004, researchers from [[Delft University of Technology]] and [[Colorado School of Mines]] showed solid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-containing hydrates could be formed at ambient temperature and 10s of [[Bar (unit)|bar]] by adding small amounts of promoting substances such as [[THF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1102076|title=Stable Low-Pressure Hydrogen Clusters Stored in a Binary Clathrate Hydrate|year=2004|last1=Florusse|first1=L.

==Stationary hydrogen storage==
Unlike mobile applications, hydrogen density is not a huge problem for stationary applications. As for mobile applications, stationary applications can use established technology:

===Underground hydrogen storage===
[[File:Available storage technologies, their capacity and discharge time.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|'Available storage technologies, their capacity and discharge time.'&lt;ref name=CSTAFF /&gt;{{rp|12}}]]
[[Underground hydrogen storage]] is the practice of hydrogen storage in underground [[cave]]rns, [[salt dome]]s and depleted oil and gas fields. Large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in underground caverns by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] for many years without any difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyweb.de/Knowledge/Ecn-h2a.html 1994 – ECN abstract].

The round-trip efficiency is approximately 40% (vs. 75-80% for [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-hydro (PHES)]]), and the cost is slightly higher than pumped hydro, if only a limited number of hours of storage is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201202/20120208ATT37544/20120208ATT37544EN.pdf |title=European Renewable Energy Network Study |date=January 2012 |pages=86, 188 |publisher=European Union |location=Brussels }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study referenced by a European staff working paper found that for large scale storage, the cheapest option is hydrogen at €140/MWh for 2,000 hours of storage using an electrolyser, salt cavern storage and combined-cycle power plant.&lt;ref name=CSTAFF&gt;{{cite web|title=COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT: Energy storage – the role of electricity |url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/swd2017_61_document_travail_service_part1_v6.pdf |date=1 Feb 2017|publisher=European Commission |accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} The European project [[Hyunder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why storing large scale intermittent renewable energies with hydrogen? |url=http://www.hyunder.eu/ |website=Hyunder |access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicated in 2013 that for the storage of wind and solar energy an additional 85 caverns are required as it cannot be covered by PHES and [[CAES]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyunder.eu/images/Presentations%20EUSEW/2%20HyUnder%20EUSEW%20workshop%20Luis%20Correas.pdf Storing renewable energy: Is hydrogen a viable solution?]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A German case study on storage of hydrogen in salt caverns found that if the German power surplus (7% of total variable renewable generation by 2025 and 20% by 2050) would be converted to hydrogen and stored underground, these quantities would require some 15 caverns of 500,000 cubic metres each by 2025 and some 60 caverns by 2050 – corresponding to approximately one third of the number of underground gas caverns currently operated in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bringing North Sea Energy Ashore Efficiently |url=https://www.worldenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/WEC-brochure_Online-offshore.pdf |publisher=World Energy Council Netherlands|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, Sandia Labs are conducting research into the storage of hydrogen in depleted oil and gas fields, which could easily absorb large amounts of renewably produced hydrogen as there are some 2.7 million depleted wells in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerdes|first1=Justin|title=Enlisting Abandoned Oil and Gas Wells as 'Electron Reserves' |url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/enlisting-abandoned-oil-and-gas-wells-as-electron-reserves#gs.ByNEEjY|website=Greentech Media|accessdate=22 April 2018|date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power to gas===
[[Power to gas]] is a technology which converts [[electricity|electrical]] power to a gas [[fuel]]. There are two methods: the first is to use the electricity for [[water splitting]] and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid; the second, less efficient method is used to convert [[carbon dioxide]] and hydrogen to [[methane]], (see [[natural gas]]) using [[electrolysis]] and the [[Sabatier reaction]]. A third option is to combine the hydrogen via electrolysis with a source of carbon (either carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide from [[biogas]], from industrial processes or via [[Carbon_dioxide_removal#Direct_air_capture_(DAC)|direct air-captured carbon dioxide]]) via [[biomethanation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rathi|first1=Akshat|title=Batteries can't solve the world's biggest energy-storage problem.

This process is highly efficient, as the archaea are self-replicating and only require low-grade (60°C) heat to perform the reaction.

Another process has also been achieved by [[SoCalGas]] to convert the carbon dioxide in raw biogas to methane in a single electrochemical step, representing a simpler method of converting excess renewable electricity into storable natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SoCalGas and Opus 12 Successfully Demonstrate Technology That Simplifies Conversion of Carbon Dioxide into Storable Renewable Energy|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/socalgas-and-opus-12-successfully-demonstrate-technology-that-simplifies-conversion-of-carbon-dioxide-into-storable-renewable-energy-300633313.html|website=prnewswire.com|publisher=prnewswire|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The UK has completed surveys and is preparing to start injecting hydrogen into the gas grid as the grid previously carried 'town gas' which is a 50% hydrogen-methane gas formed from coal. Auditors KPMG found that converting the UK to hydrogen gas could be £150bn to £200bn cheaper than rewiring British homes to use electric heating powered by lower-carbon sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ambrose |first1=Jillian |title=Energy networks prepare to blend hydrogen into the gas grid for the first time |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/01/06/hydrogen/ |newspaper=The Telegraph |accessdate=22 April 2018 |date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays can then be used for load balancing in the energy grid.

Pipeline storage of hydrogen where a natural gas network is used for the storage of hydrogen. Before switching to [[natural gas]], the German gas networks were operated using [[towngas]], which for the most part (60-65%) consisted of hydrogen. The storage capacity of the German natural gas network is more than 200,000 GW·h which is enough for several months of energy requirement. By comparison, the capacity of all German pumped storage power plants amounts to only about 40 GW·h. The transport of energy through a gas network is done with much less loss (&lt;0.1%) than in a power network (8%). The use of the existing [[List of natural gas pipelines|natural gas pipelines]] for hydrogen was studied by NaturalHy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalhy.net/docs/Naturalhy_Brochure.pdf Naturalhy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118102741/http://www.naturalhy.net/docs/Naturalhy_Brochure.pdf |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Targets were set by the [[FreedomCAR]] Partnership in January 2002 between the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) and [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. DOE]] (Targets assume a 5-kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage system). The 2005 targets were not reached in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscar.org/commands/files_download.php?files_id=82 Hydrogen Storage Technologies Roadmap]. uscar.org. November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The targets were revised in 2009 to reflect new data on system efficiencies obtained from fleets of test cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Jun|author2=Sudik, A |author3=Wolverton, C |author4= Siegel, DJ |title=High capacity hydrogen storage materials: attributes for automotive applications and techniques for materials discovery|journal=Chem.

It is important to note that these targets are for the hydrogen storage system, not the hydrogen storage material. System densities are often around half those of the working material, thus while a material may store 6 [[Mass fraction (chemistry)#Mass percentage|wt%]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a working system using that material may only achieve 3 wt% when the weight of tanks, temperature and pressure control equipment, etc., is considered.

In 2010, only two storage technologies were identified as having the potential to meet DOE targets: MOF-177 exceeds 2010 target for volumetric capacity, while cryo-compressed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exceeds more restrictive 2015 targets for both gravimetric and volumetric capacity (see slide 6 in &lt;ref name="hydrogen.energy.gov"&gt;R.

'''Ice segregation''' is the geological phenomenon produced by the formation of [[ice lens]]es, which induce erosion when [[moisture]], [[diffusion|diffused]] within [[soil]] or [[rock (geology)|rock]], accumulates in a localized zone. The ice initially accumulates within small collocated pores or pre-existing cracks, and, as long as the conditions remain favorable, continues to collect in the ice layer or ice lens, wedging the soil or rock apart. Ice lenses grow parallel to the surface and several centimeters to several decimeters (inches to feet) deep in the soil or rock.  Studies between 1990 and present have demonstrated that rock fracture by ice segregation (i.e., the fracture of intact rock by ice lenses that grow by drawing water from their surroundings during periods of sustained subfreezing temperatures) is a more effective weathering process than the freeze-thaw process which older texts proposed.&lt;ref&gt;"Periglacial weathering and headwall erosion in cirque glacier bergschrunds"; Johnny W. Sanders, Kurt M. Cuffey1, Jeffrey R. Moore, Kelly R. MacGregor and Jeffrey L. Kavanaugh; Geology; July 18, 2012, doi: 10.1130/G33330.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Ice lenses play the key role in fracture of bedrock and [[frost heaving|frost induced heaving]] of soils, which are fundamental to [[weathering]] in cold regions. Frost heaving creates debris and dramatically shapes landscapes into [[patterned ground|complex patterns]]. Rock fracture in [[periglacial]] regions (alpine, subpolar and polar) has often been attributed to the freezing and volumetric expansion of water trapped within pores and cracks. However the majority of frost heaving and of [[bedrock]] fracture results instead from ice segregation in ice lenses in the near-surface frozen regions. Ice segregation results in rock fracture and frost heave.&lt;ref name= Murton2006/&gt;

==Description of the phenomena==

===Common frost heaving===
[[Image:Freezing air ice lens formation.jpg|thumbnail|260px|right| Ice lens formation resulting in [[Frost heaving|frost heave]] in cold climates.]]
[[Frost heaving|Frost heave]] is the process by which the freezing of water-[[Vadose zone|saturated]] [[soil]] causes the [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] and upward thrust of the ground surface.&lt;ref name=Rempel2001/&gt;  This process can distort and crack [[pavement (roads)|pavement]], damage the [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]]s of buildings and displace soil in regular patterns. Moist, fine-grained soil at certain [[temperature]]s is most susceptible to frost heaving.

===Ice lenses in tundra===
[[Image:Ice lens formation in tundra.jpg|260px|thumbnail|left| Ice Lens formation within tundra.]]
Frost heave is common in arctic tundra because the permafrost maintains ground frozen at depth and prevents snowmelt and rain from draining. As a result, conditions are optimal for deep ice lens formation with large ice accumulations and significant soil displacement.&lt;ref name=Peterson2008/&gt;

Differential frost heave producing complex patterns will occur if the correct conditions exist.  Feedback from one year's frost heave influences the effects in subsequent years.  For example, a small increase in overburden will affect the depth of ice formation and heaving in the subsequent years. Time-dependent models of the frost heave indicate that over a long enough period the short-separation perturbations damp out, while mid-range perturbations grow and come to dominate the landscape.&lt;ref name=Peterson2008/&gt;

===Subglacial ice formations===
[[Image:Subglacial_ice_lens_formation.jpg|260px|thumbnail|right| Ice lens growing within glacial till and bedrock beneath glacial ice.]]
Bands of sediment or [[glacial till]] have been observed below Antarctic ice sheets; these are believed to result from ice lenses forming in the debris. In the faster flowing glacial regions, the ice sheet is sliding over water saturated sediments (glacial till) or actually being floated upon a layer of water. The till and water serve to reduce friction between the base of the ice sheet and the bedrock. These subglacial waters come from surface water which seasonally drains from melting at the surface, as well as from ice-sheet base melting.&lt;ref name=Bell2008/&gt;

Ice lens growth within the bedrock below the glacier is projected during the summer months when there is ample water at the base of the glacier. Ice lenses will form within the bedrock, accumulating until the rock is sufficiently weakened that it shears or spalls off. Layers of rock along the interface between glaciers and the bedrock are freed, producing much of the sediments in these basal regions of glaciers. Since the rate of glacier movement is dependent upon the characteristics of this basal ice, research is ongoing to better quantify the phenomena.&lt;ref name=Rempel2008/&gt;

==Understanding the phenomena==
[[image:palsaaerialview.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ice lenses are responsible for [[palsa]] (picture) growth]]
The basic condition for ice segregation and frost heaving is existence of a region in soil or porous rock which is relatively permeable, is in a temperature range which allows the coexistence of ice and water (in a premelted state), and has a temperature gradient across the region.&lt;ref name=Dash2006/&gt;

A key phenomenon for understanding ice segregation in soil or porous rock (also referred to as an ice lens due to its shape) is premelting, which is the development of a liquid film on surfaces and interfaces at temperatures significantly below their bulk melting temperature.  The term premelting is used to describe the reduction in the melting temperature (below 0&amp;nbsp;°C) which results from the surface curvature of porous media confining water (the [[Gibbs-Thomson effect]]).  Premelted water exists as a thin layer on the surface of ice. Under premelting conditions, ice and water can coexist at temperatures below -10&amp;nbsp;°C in a porous medium.  The Gibbs-Thomson effect results in water migrating down a thermal gradient (from higher temperatures to lower temperatures); Dash states, “…material is carried to  colder regions…” This can also be viewed energetically as favoring larger ice particles over smaller ([[Ostwald ripening]]).  As a result, when conditions exist for ice segregation (ice lens formation) water flows toward the segregated ice and freezes on the surface, thickening the segregated ice layer.&lt;ref name=Dash2006/&gt;

It is possible to develop analytic models using these principles; they predict the following characteristics, which are consistent with field observations: 
* Ice forms in layers which are parallel to the overlying surface.&lt;ref name=Murton2006/&gt;
* The ice initially forms with small microfractures parallel to the surface. As ice accumulates the ice layer grows outward in what is frequently characterized as an ice-lens parallel to the surface.&lt;ref name=Murton2006/&gt;
* Ice will form in water-permeable rock in much the same way as it forms in soil.&lt;ref name=Murton2006/&gt;
*If the ice layer resulted from a cooling from a single direction (e.g., the top) the fracture tends to lie close to the surface(e.g., 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm in chalk). If the ice layer results from freezing from both sides (e.g., above and below) the fracture tends to lie deeper (e.g., 2-3.5&amp;nbsp;cm in chalk).&lt;ref name=Murton2006/&gt;
* Ice forms rapidly when liquid is readily available. When liquid is readily available, the segregated ice (ice lens) grows parallel to the exposed cold surface. It grows rapidly until the [[latent heat of fusion|heat liberated by freezing]] warms the ice lens boundary, reducing the temperature gradient and controlling the rate of further ice segregation.  Under these conditions, ice grows in a single layer which gets progressively thicker.  The surface is displaced and soil repositioned or rock fractured.&lt;ref name= Rempel2007/&gt;
* Ice forms in a different pattern when liquid is less readily available. When liquid is not readily available, the segregated ice (ice lens) grows slowly. The [[latent heat of fusion|heat liberated by freezing]] is unable to warm the ice lens boundary.   Hence the area through which the water is diffusing continues to cool until another ice segregation layer forms below the first layer. With sustained cold weather, this process can repeat, producing multiple ice layers (ice lenses), all parallel to the surface.  The formation of multiple layers (multiple lenses) producing more extensive frost damage within rocks or soils.&lt;ref name= Rempel2007/&gt;
* No ice forms under some conditions. At higher overburden pressures and at relatively warm surface temperatures, ice segregation cannot occur; the liquid present freezes within the pore space, with no bulk ice segregation and no measurable surface deformation or frost damage.&lt;ref name=Rempel2007/&gt;

==Ice lens growth in rock==
{{see also|Frost weathering}}
Rocks routinely contains pores of varying size and shape, regardless of origin or location. Rocks voids are essentially small cracks, and serve as the location from which the crack can propagate if the rock is placed in tension. If ice accumulates in a pore asymmetrically, the ice will place the rock in tension in a plane perpendicular to the ice accumulation direction. Hence the rock will crack along a plane perpendicular to the direction of ice accumulation, which is effectively parallel to the surface.&lt;ref Name=Walder1985/&gt;

Walder and Hallet developed models that predicts rock crack-growth locations and rates consistent with fractures actually observed in the field. Their model predicted that marble and granite grow cracks most effectively when the temperatures range from a −4&amp;nbsp;°C to −15&amp;nbsp;°C; in this range granite may develop fractures enclosing an ice 3 meters in length in a year. When the temperature is higher the ice which is formed does not apply enough pressure to cause the crack to propagate. When the temperature is below this range the water is less mobile and cracks grow more slowly.&lt;ref Name=Walder1985/&gt;

Mutron confirmed that ice initially forms in pores and creates small microfractures parallel to the surface. As ice accumulates, the ice layer grows outward in what is frequently characterized as an ice-lens parallel to the surface. Ice will form in water-permeable rock in much the same way as it forms in soil. If the ice layer resulted from a cooling from a single direction (e.g., the top) the rock fracture tends to lie close to the surface(e.g., 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm in chalk). If the ice layer results from freezing from both sides (e.g., above and below) the rock fracture tends to lie deeper (e.g., 2-3.5&amp;nbsp;cm in chalk).&lt;ref name=Murton2006/&gt;

{{Other uses|Indian Summer (disambiguation)}}

An '''[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] summer''' is a period of unseasonably warm, dry weather that sometimes occurs in [[autumn]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Indian summers are common in North America, Europe and Asia. The US [[National Weather Service]] defines this as weather conditions that are sunny and clear with above average temperatures, occurring September to November.&lt;ref name="NWS"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Deedler |first=William|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/dtx/stories/i-summer.php |title=Just What Is Indian Summer And Did Indians Really Have Anything To Do With It?|publisher= National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office|location=Detroit/Pontiac, MI|date=Fall 1996|accessdate=September 24, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009005228/http://www.crh.noaa.gov/dtx/stories/i-summer.php|archivedate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually described as occurring after a [[Frost#Effect on plants|killing frost]].&lt;ref name="NWS"/&gt;
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Etymology and usage==
Late-19th century Boston lexicographer Albert Matthews made an exhaustive search of early American literature in an attempt to discover who coined the expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S8RGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=indian+summer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwB2oVChMIn4vzscSmyAIVQ5keCh1WmA8a#v=onepage&amp;q=indian%20summer&amp;f=false |title=The Term Indian Summer | last =Matthews | first =Albert |authorlink= | journal =Monthly Weather Review | volume =30 | issue =2 | pages =69–80 |date =February 1902 |doi = 10.1175/1520-0493-30.2.69c|accessdate=October 3; 2015 |quote= |bibcode = 1902MWRv...30...69M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference he found dated from 1851. He also found the phrase in a letter written in England in 1778, but discounted that as a coincidental use of the phrase.

Later research showed that the earliest known reference to Indian Summer in its current sense occurs in an essay written in the United States in the late 1770s (probably 1778) by J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur. The letter was first published in French. The essay remained unavailable in the United States until the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beneath the Second Sun: A Cultural History of Indian Summer|publisher=New Hampshire|author=Sweeting, Adam W.|page=14-15|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0zTH_qFXiAC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=%22indian+summer%22+%22Crevecoeur%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z2jxYZOlDn&amp;sig=f0xOthHUPhblWRb1srZVuvPs-Hg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVy4nR68PWAhVKNSYKHar8CN0Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22indian%20summer%22%20%22Crevecoeur%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the exact origins of the term are uncertain,&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|title=Hints of an Indian Summer|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23952634|publisher=BBC|accessdate=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was perhaps so-called because it was first noted in regions inhabited by Native Americans ("Indians"), or because the Native Americans first described it to Europeans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian summer|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Indian+summer|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it had been based on the warm and hazy conditions in autumn when Native Americans hunted.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

In literature and history, the term is sometimes used metaphorically. The title of [[Van Wyck Brooks]]' ''New England: Indian Summer'' (1940) suggests an era of inconsistency, infertility, and depleted capabilities, a period of seemingly robust strength that is only an imitation of an earlier season of actual strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Commager|first=Henry Steele|title=In New England's Lesser Days|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/08/18/93989097.pdf|accessdate=October 6, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 18, 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Dean Howells' 1886 novel "Indian Summer" uses the term to mean a time when one may recover some of the happiness of youth. The main character, jilted as a young man, leads a solitary life until he rediscovers romance in early middle age.

In [[British English]], the term is used in the same way as in North America. In the UK, observers knew of the American usage from the mid-19th century onwards, and ''The Indian Summer of a Forsyte'' is the metaphorical title of the 1918 second volume of ''[[The Forsyte Saga]]'' by [[John Galsworthy]]. However, early 20th-century climatologists [[Gordon Manley]] and [[Hubert Lamb]] used it only when referring to the American phenomenon, and the expression did not gain wide currency in Great Britain until the 1950s. In former times such a period was associated with the autumn feast days of [[St. Martin's Day|St. Martin]] and [[Saint Luke]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian summer: What exactly is it?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15127159|publisher=BBC|accessdate=September 24, 2014|date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English translation of Boris Pasternak's [[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]], the term is used to describe the unseasonably warm weather leading up to the [[Great October Socialist Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/434433796|title=El doctor Zhivago|last=1890-1960.|first=Pasternak, Boris Leonidovich,|date=D.L. 1994|publisher=RBA|others=Gutiérrez, Fernando, 1911-1984.|isbn=844730681X|location=Barcelona|oclc=434433796}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2015}}

Similar weather conditions, with local variations also exist. A warm period in autumn is called "Altweibersommer" ([[:de:Altweibersommer|de]]: "old women's summer") in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Hungary]] ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''vénasszonyok nyara''), [[Estonia]] ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]: ''[[:et:vananaistesuvi|vananaistesuvi]]''), [[Finland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Intiaanikesä| last1=Kallio|first1=Jussi | work = Kotimaisten kielten keskus| date = October 13, 2009| accessdate = September 12, 2015| url = http://www.kotus.fi/nyt/kotuksen_kolumnit/kieli-ikkuna_%281996_2009%29/intiaanikesa | language = fi }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a number of [[Slavic language|Slavic-language]] countries—for example, in [[Czech republic]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Croatia]]—it is known as "old woman's summer" ( {{lang-cs|babí léto}}, {{lang-pl|babie lato}}, {{lang-sk|babie leto}}, {{lang-rus|бабье лето|p=ˈbabʲjə ˈlʲetə}}, {{lang-hr|bablje ljeto}}). In Bulgaria, it is known as "gypsy summer" or "poor man's summer". In Sweden, there's "Brittsommar" (out of "Birgitta" and "Britta", having their [[name day]]s around the time, October 7). In [[Irish Language|Gaelic]] [[Ireland]], the phenomenon is called "fómhar beag na ngéanna" (little autumn of the geese).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla (Ó Dónaill) | url=http://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/fómhar | language=Irish | accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In temperate parts of [[South America]]—such as southernmost [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]]—the phenomenon is known as "Veranico", "Veranito" or "Veranillo" (literally, "little summer"), and usually occurs in early autumn between late April and mid-May, when it is known as "Veranico de Mayo" ("May's little summer") or as "Veranito de San Juan" ("Saint John's little summer"). Its onset and duration are directly associated with the occurrence of [[El Niño]].

In other countries it is associated with autumnal [[name day]]s or [[Calendar of saints|saint day]]s such as [[Teresa of Ávila]] ([[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and [[France]]), [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin]]'s Summer ([[Spain]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]] and [[Malta]]), [[Michaelmas]] summer ([[Serbia]] and [[Republika Srpska]]), [[St. Martin's Day]] ([[Netherlands]]), [[Bridget of Sweden]] in [[Sweden]], and [[Saint Michael the Archangel]] in [[Welsh language|Wales]]. In [[Turkey]] it is called [[pastirma]] yazı, meaning pastrami summer, since the month of November was considered to be the best time to make pastrami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=İstanbul'a kış 20 Ocak’ta gelecek!|url=http://www.yirmidorthaber.com/guncel/istanbula-kis-20-ocakta-gelecek/haber-961412|language=Turkish|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Macfarlane (travel writer)|Robert Macfarlane]] deemed ''The Peregrine'' to be "a masterpiece of twentieth-century non-fiction" in his introduction to the New York Review Books edition of the book.&lt;ref&gt;''The Peregrine'' by J.A. Baker, Introduction by Robert Macfarlane, New York Review Books 2005, {{ISBN|9781590171332}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the back jacket cover of the same edition, [[James Dickey]] states that the book "transcends any 'nature writing' of our time," while [[Barry Lopez]] declares the book to be "one of the most beautifully written, carefully observed and evocative wildlife accounts I have ever read." [[Werner Herzog]] called it the "one book I would ask you to read if you want to make films,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Werner Herzog's Masterclass|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFqiy0l5qTg|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said elsewhere "... it has prose of the caliber that we have not seen since [[Joseph Conrad]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Werner Herzog's Required Reading |url=http://www.openculture.com/2015/12/werner-herzog-lists-of-required-books-and-films.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, ''The Peregrine'' was included by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] in a list of 10 contenders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AHRC Favourite Nature Books|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/favouritenaturebooks/}}&lt;/ref&gt; to find the UK's favourite book about nature. When the result was announced at the end of January on the [[BBC]] ''[[Winterwatch]]'' programme it did not make the top three. The poll was topped by ''Fingers in the Sparkle Jar'' by [[Chris Packham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Chris Packham's Fingers in the Sparkle Jar voted UK's favorite nature book  |url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/chris-packhams-fingers-in-the-sparkle-jar-voted-uks-favourite-nature-book1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book recounts a single year from October to April (probably of 1962/3) from the author's ten-year obsession with the [[Peregrine falcon|peregrines]] that wintered near his home in [[Chelmsford]], Essex in eastern England. The writing is lyrically charged throughout, as the author's role of diligent observer gives way to a personal transformation, as Baker becomes, in the words of James Dickey on the book's jacket cover, "a fusion of man and bird."
 
Baker's only other book is 1969's ''The Hill of Summer,'' a lyrical and somewhat visionary account of summer's progress across the wilder parts of southern England.  Though not as famous as ''The Peregrine,'' it enjoys much the same reputation for literary beauty and naturalist precision.

In 2011, Collins published a new edition of ''The Peregrine''&lt;ref&gt;''The Peregrine: The Hill of Summer &amp; Diaries: The Complete Works of J.A. Baker'', Introduction by Mark Cocker &amp; Edited by John Fanshawe, Collins 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-00-739590-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also included ''The Hill of Summer'' and extracts from his diaries. The book includes an introduction by [[Mark Cocker]] and notes by John Fanshawe. Prior to this book, little was known about Baker's personal life but this has now changed. He was born on 6 August 1926, to engineering draughtsman Wilfred and his wife Pansy Baker,&lt;ref&gt;The Peregrine: 50th Anniversary Edition, J. A. Baker, Introduction (by Mark Cocker)&lt;/ref&gt; and lived in Chelmsford. His secondary education was at [[King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford]]. His books are based largely on his observations of birds in the Essex countryside especially in the area from Chelmsford to the coast. He was unable to drive (despite working for [[The Automobile Association]]) and travelled by bicycle. From around 1970 he suffered from severe [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and contracted cancer as a result of the drugs taken to alleviate the arthritis. He died on 26 December 1987.

The [[University of Essex]] holds items associated with Baker. These include his diaries,  drafts of his books, corrected proofs, correspondence and his optical equipment used when birdwatching. The archive was catalogued in 2016 by Hetty Saunders and is now open to all those interested in Baker's life and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Launch of University of Essex J A Baker Archive |url=https://www1.essex.ac.uk/news/event.aspx?e_id=10628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017 Little Toller Books published the first biography of Baker, entitled ''My House of Sky - The life and work of J A Baker'' by Hetty Saunders.&lt;ref&gt;''My House of Sky - The life and work of J. A. Baker'' by Hetty Saunders, Little Toller Books 2017, {{ISBN|978-1-908213-49-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the biography, the book includes a selection of Baker's poetry, an article about the J. A. Baker Archive by John Fanshawe, with photographs of some of the items, and a section of photographs of Baker Country taken by local photographer, Christopher Matthews. The preface to the book is by Robert Macfarlane.

'''Ken J. Weber''' (November 28, 1943 &amp;ndash; August 4, 2007) was a [[Rhode Island]] [[journalist]] and nature writer. He worked for the [[Providence Journal]] from 1971 until 1996, and continued to write a weekly nature article until his death. He has written many books about hiking. His most popular, "Weekend Walks in Rhode Island" is in its fourth edition, and is a popular guide for day hikes in the state. Ken held a staff position at the Audubon Society of Rhode Island and offered occasional nature talks.

'''Limu o Pele''' or '''Pele's seaweed''' ([[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], literally, "seaweed of Pele", after [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] the Hawaiian fire goddess of [[volcano]]es) is a geological term for thin sheets and subsequently shattered flakes of brownish-green to near-colourless [[volcanic glass]] [[lava]] spatter that commonly resemble [[seaweed]] in appearance, that have been erupted from a [[volcano]]. Limu o Pele is formed when water is forced into and trapped inside lava, as when waves wash over the top of the exposed flows of the molten rock. The water boils and is instantly converted to steam, expanding to form bubbles within the lava. The lava rapidly cools and solidifies as the bubbles grow. The volcanic glass bubbles burst and are dispersed by the wind, showering flakes of glass downwind. 

Limu o Pele has been found around subaerial [[Littoral zone|littoral]] [[volcanic cones]] and also at [[submarine volcano]]es, for example, on the summit of [[Loihi Seamount|Lōʻihi]] [[seamount]].&lt;ref&gt;Clague, D. A. et al. (2000) ''Lava bubble-wall fragments formed by submarine hydrovolcanic explosions on Lōʻihi Seamount and Kılauea Volcano'', Bulletin of Volcanology, volume 61 pages 437–449.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15290">A '''liquid nitrogen vehicle''' is powered by [[liquid nitrogen]], which is stored in a tank. Traditional nitrogen engine designs work by heating the liquid nitrogen in a [[heat exchanger]], extracting heat from the ambient air and using the resulting pressurized gas to operate a piston or rotary motor. Vehicles propelled by liquid nitrogen have been demonstrated, but are not used commercially. One such vehicle, ''[[Liquid Air]]'' was demonstrated in 1902.

Liquid nitrogen propulsion may also be incorporated in hybrid systems, e.g., [[battery electric propulsion]] and fuel tanks to recharge the batteries. This kind of system is called a hybrid liquid nitrogen-electric propulsion. Additionally, [[regenerative braking]] can also be used in conjunction with this system.

In June 2016 trials will begin in London, UK on supermarket J Sainsbury's fleet of food delivery vehicles:  using a Dearman nitrogen engine to provide power for the cooling of food cargo when the vehicle is stationary and the main engine is off. Currently delivery lorries mostly have 2nd smaller diesel engines to power cooling when the main engine is off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Sainsbury's trials Dearman's world-leading cooling technology|publisher = Innovate UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sainsburys-trials-dearmans-world-leading-cooling-technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Liquid nitrogen is generated by [[Cryocooler|cryogenic]] or reversed [[Stirling engine]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/engineering/9780123749963/chapter-14dot-vapor-and-gas-refrigeration-cycles/toc210 |title= Modern Engineering Thermodynamics |first= Robert T. |last= Balmer |publisher= [[Academic Press]] |chapter= 14.15 Reversed Stirling Cycle Refrigeration |isbn= 978-0-12-374996-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stirlingultracold.com/history history of refrigeration with Stirling engines]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stirlingcryogenics.com/home/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130203080156/http://www.stirlingcryogenics.com/home/ |archivedate=2013-02-03 |df= }} Comercial Sterling engine cooling&lt;/ref&gt; coolers that liquefy the main component of air, [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  The cooler can be powered by electricity or through direct mechanical work from [[Hydroelectricity|hydro]] or
[[wind turbine]]s. 
Liquid nitrogen is distributed and stored in [[Vacuum flask|insulated containers]].  The insulation reduces heat flow into the stored nitrogen; this is necessary because heat from the surrounding environment boils the liquid, which then transitions to a gaseous state.  Reducing inflowing heat reduces the loss of liquid nitrogen in storage.  The requirements of storage prevent the use of pipelines as a means of transport.  Since long-distance pipelines would be costly due to the insulation requirements, it would be costly to use distant energy sources for production of liquid nitrogen.  Petroleum reserves are typically a vast distance from consumption but can be transferred at ambient temperatures.

Liquid nitrogen consumption is in essence production in reverse.  The [[Stirling engine]] or cryogenic heat engine offers a way to power vehicles and a means to generate electricity.  Liquid nitrogen can also serve as a direct coolant for [[refrigerators]], [[CPU cooling|electrical equipment]] and  [[air conditioning]] units.  The consumption of liquid nitrogen is in effect boiling and returning the [[nitrogen]] to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].  &lt;!-- discuss elevated pollution to produce and transport the gigatonnes of the stuff in the first place --&gt;

In the [[Dearman Engine]] the nitrogen is heated by combining it with the heat exchange fluid inside the cylinder of the engine.&lt;ref name="T&amp;T"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Mullistava idea: Tulevaisuuden auto voi kulkea typpimoottorilla |author=Raili Leino |date=2012-10-22 |journal=Tekniikka&amp;Talous |url=http://www.tekniikkatalous.fi/autot/mullistava+idea+tulevaisuuden+auto+voi+kulkea+typpimoottorilla/a849225 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Technology |publisher=Dearman Engine Company |year=2012 |url=http://www.dearmanengine.com/cms/the-technology/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022012756/http://www.dearmanengine.com/cms/the-technology/ |archivedate=2012-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This primary source provides the same information as the Finnish language reliable source. --&gt;

==Criticisms==

=== Cost of production ===

Liquid nitrogen production is an energy-intensive process. Currently practical refrigeration plants producing a few tons/day of liquid nitrogen operate at about 50% of [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Franz, C. A. Ordonez, A. Carlos, ''Cryogenic Heat Engines Made Using Electrocaloric Capacitors'', American Physical Society, Texas Section Fall Meeting, October 4–6, 2001 Fort Worth, Texas Meeting ID: TSF01, abstract #EC.009, 10/2001. {{bibcode|2001APS..TSF.EC009F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently surplus liquid nitrogen is produced as a byproduct in the production of [[liquid oxygen]].&lt;ref name="T&amp;T" /&gt;

===Energy density of liquid nitrogen===
Any process that relies on a phase-change of a substance will have much lower [[energy density|energy densities]] than processes involving a chemical reaction in a substance, which in turn have lower energy densities than nuclear reactions.  Liquid nitrogen as an energy store has a low energy density. Liquid hydrocarbon fuels, by comparison, have a high energy density. A high energy density makes the logistics of transport and storage more convenient. Convenience is an important factor in consumer acceptance. The convenient storage of petroleum fuels combined with its low cost has led to an unrivaled success. In addition, a petroleum fuel is a [[primary energy source]], not just an energy storage and transport medium.

The energy density — derived from nitrogen's isobaric heat of vaporization and specific heat in gaseous state — that can be realised from liquid nitrogen at atmospheric pressure and zero degrees Celsius ambient temperature is about 97 watt-hours per kilogram (W·h/kg).   This compares with 100-250 W·h/kg for a [[lithium-ion battery]] and 3,000 W·h/kg for a gasoline [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] running at 28% thermal efficiency, 30 times the density of liquid nitrogen used at the Carnot efficiency.&lt;ref name="Knowlen"&gt;C. Knowlen, A.T. Mattick, A.P. Bruckner and A. Hertzberg, [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.aa.washington.edu/AERP/cryocar/Papers/sae98.pdf "High Efficiency Conversion Systems for Liquid Nitrogen Automobiles"], Society of Automotive Engineers Inc, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

For an isothermal expansion engine to have a range comparable to an internal combustion engine, a {{convert|350|l|USgal|0|adj=on}} insulated onboard storage vessel is required.&lt;ref name="Knowlen" /&gt; A practical volume, but a noticeable increase over the typical {{convert|50|l|USgal|0|adj=on}} gasoline tank. The addition of more complex power cycles would reduce this requirement and help enable frost free operation. However, no commercially practical instances of liquid nitrogen use for vehicle propulsion exist.

===Frost formation===
Unlike internal combustion engines, using a cryogenic working fluid requires heat exchangers to warm and cool the working fluid. In a humid environment, frost formation will prevent heat flow and thus represents an engineering challenge. To prevent frost build up, multiple working fluids can be used. This adds topping cycles to ensure the heat exchanger does not fall below freezing.  Additional heat exchangers, weight, complexity, efficiency loss, and expense, would be required to enable frost free operation.&lt;ref name="Knowlen" /&gt;

===Safety===
However efficient the insulation on the nitrogen fuel tank, there will inevitably be losses by evaporation to the atmosphere. If a vehicle is stored in a poorly ventilated space, there is some risk that leaking nitrogen could reduce the oxygen concentration in the air and cause [[asphyxiation]]. Since nitrogen is a colorless and odourless gas that already makes up 78% of air, such a change would be difficult to detect.

Cryogenic liquids are hazardous if spilled. Liquid nitrogen can cause [[frostbite]] and can make some materials extremely brittle.

As liquid N2 is colder than 90.2K, oxygen from the atmosphere can condense. Liquid oxygen can spontaneously and violently react with organic chemicals, including petroleum products like asphalt.&lt;ref&gt;Werley, Barry L. (Edtr.) (1991). "Fire Hazards in Oxygen Systems". ASTM Technical Professional training. Philadelphia: ASTM International Subcommittee G-4.05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the liquid to gas [[expansion ratio]] of this substance is 1:694, a tremendous amount of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporized. In an incident in 2006 at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were sealed with brass plugs. As a result, the tank failed catastrophically, and exploded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Investigative Report on Chemistry 301A Cylinder Explosion|author = Brent S. Mattox|publisher = [[Texas A&amp;M University]]|format = reprint|url = http://ucih.ucdavis.edu/docs/chemistry_301a.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081031073557/http://ucih.ucdavis.edu/docs/chemistry_301a.pdf|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tanks ===
The tanks must be designed to safety standards appropriate for a [[pressure vessel]], such as [[ISO 11439]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=33298 Gas cylinders -- High pressure cylinders for the on-board storage of natural gas as a fuel for automotive vehicles]&lt;/ref&gt;

The storage tank may be made of:
* [[steel]]
* [[aluminium]]
* [[carbon fiber]]
* [[Kevlar]]
* other materials, or combinations of the above.

The fiber materials are considerably lighter than metals but generally more expensive. Metal tanks can withstand a large number of pressure cycles, but must be checked for corrosion periodically. Liquid nitrogen, LN2, is commonly transported in insulated tanks, up to 50 litres, at atmospheric pressure. These tanks, being non-pressurized tanks, are not subject to inspection. Very large tanks for LN2 are sometimes pressurized to less than 25 psi to aid in transferring the liquid at point of use.

=== Emission output ===
Like other non-combustion energy storage technologies, a liquid nitrogen vehicle displaces the emission source from the vehicle's tail pipe to the central electrical generating plant. Where emissions-free sources are available, net production of pollutants can be reduced. Emission control measures at a central generating plant may be more effective and less costly than treating the emissions of widely dispersed vehicles.

== Advantages ==
Liquid nitrogen vehicles are comparable in many ways to [[electric vehicle]]s, but use liquid nitrogen to store the energy instead of batteries. Their potential advantages over other vehicles include:

* Much like electrical vehicles, liquid nitrogen vehicles would ultimately be powered through the electrical grid, which makes it easier to focus on reducing pollution from one source, as opposed to the millions of vehicles on the road.
* Transportation of the fuel would not be required due to drawing power off the electrical grid. This presents significant cost benefits. Pollution created during fuel transportation would be eliminated.
* Lower maintenance costs
* Liquid nitrogen tanks can be disposed of or recycled with less pollution than batteries.
* Liquid nitrogen vehicles are unconstrained by the degradation problems associated with current battery systems.
* The tank may be able to be refilled more often and in less time than batteries can be recharged, with re-fueling rates comparable to liquid fuels.
* It can work as part of a [[combined cycle]] powertrain in conjunction with a petrol or diesel engine, using the [[waste heat]] from one to run the other in a [[turbocompound]] system. It can even run as a hybrid system.

== Disadvantages ==
The principal disadvantage is the inefficient use of primary energy. Energy is used to liquefy nitrogen, which in turn provides the energy to run the motor. Any conversion of energy has losses. For liquid nitrogen cars, electrical energy is lost during the liquefication process of nitrogen.

Liquid nitrogen is not available in public refueling stations; however, there are distribution systems in place at most welding gas suppliers and liquid nitrogen is an abundant by-product of liquid oxygen production.

== Other Uses ==
In 2008, the US Patent Office granted a patent on a liquid nitrogen powered turbine engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Reyes|first=De Reyes, Edward|title=Liquid nitrogen engine|date=25 Jun 2013|url=http://www.google.ch/patents/US8468829|accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turbine flash-expands liquid nitrogen that is sprayed into the high-pressure section of the turbine, and the expanding gas is combined with incoming pressurized air to produce a high-velocity stream of gas that is ejected from the back of the turbine. The resulting gas stream can be used to drive generators or other devices. The system has not been demonstrated to power electric generators of greater than 1&amp;nbsp;kW,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nitroturbodyne.com/ln2-turbine/|title=LN2 Turbine - Clean, Green Energy|website=www.nitroturbodyne.com|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; however higher output may possible.

The '''list of North Carolina hurricanes''' between 1900 and 1949 encompasses 75&amp;nbsp;[[tropical cyclone]]s or their remnants that affected the [[U.S. state]] of [[North Carolina]]. Collectively, cyclones in North Carolina during that time period resulted in 53&amp;nbsp;total fatalities, as well as about $328&amp;nbsp;million in damage in 2008&amp;nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]. Tropical cyclone affected the state in all but nine seasons&lt;!--1909, 1914, 1917, 1919, 1921, 1922, 1926, 1931, 1943--&gt;. In the [[1916 Atlantic hurricane season|1916 season]], five storms affected the state, which makes it the season with the most storms impacting the state.

The strongest hurricanes to affect the state during the time period were the [[1933 Outer Banks hurricane]] and the [[1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane]], which produced winds of Category&amp;nbsp;3 status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] within the state. The 1933 Outer Banks hurricane was the deadliest hurricane in the state during the time period, which killed 21&amp;nbsp;people. The remnants of a [[Georgia-South Carolina Hurricane of 1940|hurricane in 1940]] dropped heavy rainfall in the state, which caused over $150&amp;nbsp;million in damage (2008&amp;nbsp;USD) from flooding and landslides. Most storms affected the state in September, though in the first half of the 20th century, cyclones impacted the state between May and December.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5480">The following is a '''list of [[ecoregion]]s in [[Costa Rica]]'''. An ecoregion is an ecologically and geographically defined area that is smaller than a [[bioregion]], which in turn is smaller than an [[ecozone]]. All three of these are larger than an [[ecosystem]]. Ecoregions cover relatively large areas of land or water, and contain characteristic, geographically distinct assemblages of natural communities and species. The biodiversity of flora, fauna and ecosystems that characterise an ecoregion tends to be distinct from that of other ecoregions. Costa Rica is a country in Central America, bordered by [[Nicaragua]] to the north, [[Panama]] to the southeast, the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west, and the [[Caribbean Sea]] to the east. It contains 5% of the world's [[biodiversity]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

**RA - Reaktor A (1956–2002) - 6.5 MW heavy water moderated and cooled research reactor
**RB - Reaktor B (1958-...) - At the very beginning the RB reactor was designed and constructed as an unreflected zero power heavy water - natural uranium critical assembly. First criticality was reached in April 1958. Later, the 2% enriched metal uranium fuel and 80% enriched UO2 fuel were obtained and used in the reactor core. Modifications of the reactor control, safety and dosimetry systems (1960, 1976, 1988) converted the RB critical assembly to a flexible heavy water reflected experimental reactor with 1 W nominal power, operable up to 50 W. Several coupled fast-thermal systems were designed and constructed at RB reactor in the early 1990s, for the research in fast reactors physics.

In [[petroleum geology]], the '''maturity''' of a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is a measure of its state in terms of [[hydrocarbon]] generation. Maturity is established using a combination of [[geochemistry|geochemical]] and [[basin modelling]] techniques.

Rocks with high [[total organic carbon]], (termed [[source rock]]s), will alter under increasing [[temperature]] such that the organic [[molecule]]s slowly mature into [[hydrocarbon]]s (see [[diagenesis]]). Source rocks are therefore broadly categorised as ''immature'' (no hydrocarbon generation), ''sub-mature'' (limited hydrocarbon generation), ''mature'' (extensive hydrocarbon generation) and ''overmature'' (most hydrocarbons have been generated).

The maturity of a source rock can also be used as an indicator of its hydrocarbon ''potential''. That is, if a rock is sub-mature, then it has a much higher potential to generate further hydrocarbons than one that is overmature.

'''Mean High Water''' ('''MHW''') is the [[average]] of all the [[Tide|high water height]]s observed over a period of several years.  For example, in the United States this period spans 19 years and is referred to as the [[National Tidal Datum Epoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datum_options.html |title=Tidal Datums |publisher=tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''merit order''' is a way of ranking available sources of energy, especially electrical generation, based on ascending order of price (which may reflect the order of their short-run [[marginal cost]]s of production) together with amount of energy that will be generated. In a centralized management, the ranking is so that those with the lowest marginal costs are the first ones to be brought online to meet demand, and the plants with the highest marginal costs are the last to be brought on line. Dispatching generation in this way minimizes the cost of production of electricity.  Sometimes generating units must be started out of merit order, due to transmission congestion, system reliability or other reasons.

== The effect of renewable energy on merit order ==
The high demand for electricity during [[peak demand]] pushes up the bidding price for electricity, and the relatively inexpensive [[baseload power]] supply mix is supplemented by ‘[[peaking power plant]]s,' which charge a premium for their electricity.

Increasing the supply of renewable energy tends to lower the average price per unit of electricity because [[wind energy]] and [[solar energy]] have very low marginal costs: they do not have to pay for fuel, and the sole contributors to their marginal cost is operational and maintenance. With cost often reduced by feed-in-tariff revenue, their electricity is as a result, less costly on the spot market than that from coal or natural gas, and transmission companies buy from them first.&lt;ref name=Blyth,2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Climate policy uncertainty and investment risk : in support of the G8 plan of action|year=2007|publisher=OECD Publishing|location=Paris|isbn= 9789264030145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0gGyr3h0K8C&amp;pg=PA47|author=William Blyth, Ming Yang, Richard A.

Solar and wind electricity therefore substantially reduce the amount of highly priced peak electricity that transmission companies need to buy, reducing the overall cost. A study by the [[Fraunhofer Institute]] found that this "merit order effect" had allowed solar power to reduce the price of electricity on the German energy exchange by 10% on average, and by as much as 40% in the early afternoon, in 2007; as more solar electricity is fed into the grid, peak prices will come down even further.&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer" /&gt; By 2006, the "merit order effect" meant that the savings in electricity costs to German consumers more than offset for the support payments paid for renewable electricity generation.&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer" /&gt;

A 2013 study estimates the merit order effect of both wind and photovoltaic electricity generation in Germany between the years 2008 and 2012.  For each additional GWh of renewables fed into the grid, the price of electricity in the day-ahead market is reduced by 0.11–0.13{{nbsp}}¢/kWh.  The total merit order effect of wind and photovoltaics ranges from 0.5{{nbsp}}¢/kWh in 2010 to more than 1.1{{nbsp}}¢/kWh in 2012.&lt;ref name="cludius-etal-2013"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zero marginal cost of wind energy does not, however, translate, into zero marginal cost of peak load electricity in a competitive open electricity market system as wind supply cannot be dispatched to meet peak demand. The purpose of the merit order was to enable the lowest net cost electricity to be dispatched first thus minimising overall electricity system costs to consumers. Intermittent wind might be able to supply this economic function provided peak wind supply and peak demand coincide both in time and quantity. On the other hand, solar energy tends to be most abundant during peak energy demand in warm climates, maximizing its ability to displace coal and natural gas power.

A study by the [[Fraunhofer Institute]] in [[Karlsruhe]], Germany found that windpower saves German consumers €5{{nbsp}}billion a year. It is estimated to have lowered prices in European countries with high wind generation by between 3 and 23{{nbsp}}€/MWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Increasing electrical grid costs for new transmission, market trading and storage associated with wind and solar are not included in the marginal cost of power sources, instead grid costs are combined with source costs at the consumer end.

'''''Minima naturalia''''' ("natural minima"){{refn|group=n|''Minima naturalia'' is the conventional Latin translation of Greek ελάχιστα ("elachista," singular ελάχιστον, "elachiston"), which means "minima."}} were theorized by [[Aristotle]] as the smallest parts into which a homogeneous natural [[Substance theory#Ancient Greek philosophy|substance]] (e.g., flesh, bone, or wood) could be divided and still retain its [[Essence|essential]] character. In this context, "[[Nature (philosophy)#Classical nature and Aristotelian metaphysics|nature]]" means [[Four causes#Formal cause|formal]] nature. Thus, "natural minimum" may be taken to mean "formal minimum": the minimum amount of [[Four causes#Material cause|matter]] necessary to instantiate a certain form.

Speculation on ''minima naturalia'' in late Antiquity, in the Islamic world, and by Scholastic and Renaissance thinkers in Europe provided a conceptual bridge between the atomism of ancient Greece and the mechanistic philosophy of early modern thinkers like Descartes, which in turn provided a background for the rigorously mathematical and experimental atomism of modern science.&lt;ref name="Murdoch2001"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John E.

==Aristotle's initial suggestion==

According to Aristotle, the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Anaxagoras]] had taught that every thing, and every portion of a thing, contains within itself an infinite number of like and unlike parts. For example, Anaxagoras maintained that there must be blackness as well as whiteness in snow; how, otherwise, could it be turned into dark water? Aristotle criticized Anaxagoras' theory on multiple grounds, among them the following:&lt;ref name="Murdoch2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArisPhys"&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''Physics'' 1.4, 187b14–21.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Animals and plants cannot be infinitely small according to Aristotle; thus the relatively homogeneous substances of which they are composed (e.g., bone and flesh in animals, or wood in plants) could not be infinitely small, either, but must have a smallest determinate size—i.e., a natural minimum.
*On Anaxagoras' argument in which all things contain all others infinitely, water could be drawn from flesh, then flesh from that water, and water from that flesh, and so on. However, as above, because there is a smallest determinate size beyond which a further divided substance would no longer be flesh, any further cycle of such drawings out would be impossible.
*Moreover, "[s]ince every body must diminish in size when something is taken from it, and flesh is quantitatively definite in respect both of greatness and smallness, it is clear that from the minimum quantity of flesh no body can be separated out; for the flesh left would be less than the minimum of flesh."&lt;ref name="ArisPhys"/&gt;

Unlike the [[atomism]] of [[Leucippus]], [[Democritus]], and [[Epicurus]], and also unlike the later [[atomic theory]] of [[John Dalton]], the Aristotelian natural minimum was not conceptualized as physically indivisible--"atomic" in the contemporary sense. Instead, the concept was rooted in Aristotle's [[Hylomorphism|hylomorphic]] worldview, which held that every physical thing is a compound of matter (Greek ''hyle'') and a [[substantial form]] (Greek ''morphe'') that imparts its essential nature and structure. For instance, a rubber ball for a hylomorphist like Aristotle would be rubber (matter) structured by spherical shape (form).

Aristotle's intuition was that there is some smallest size beyond which matter could no longer be structured as flesh, or bone, or wood, or some other such organic substance that (for Aristotle, living before the microscope) could be considered homogeneous. For instance, if flesh were divided beyond its natural minimum, what would remain might be some [[Classical element#Greece|elemental]] water, and smaller amounts of the other elements (e.g., earth) with which water was thought to mix to form flesh. But whatever was left, the water (or earth, etc.), would no longer have the formal "[[Nature (philosophy)#Classical nature and Aristotelian metaphysics|nature]]" of flesh in particular – the remaining matter would have the form of water (or earth, etc.) rather than the substantial form of flesh.

This is suggestive of modern chemistry, in which, e.g., a bar of gold can be continually divided until one has a single [[atom]] of gold, but further division of that atom of gold yields only subatomic particles ([[electrons]], [[quark]]s, etc.) which are no longer the [[chemical element]] gold. Just as water alone is not flesh, electrons alone are not gold. Although suggestive, the parallel is not exact: the Aristotelian concept of the natural minimum of a [[Substance theory#Ancient Greek philosophy|substance]] is not a direct anticipation of the modern concept of an atom of a certain chemical element.

==Scholastic elaboration==
Aristotle's brief comments on ''minima naturalia'' in the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'' prompted further speculations by later philosophers. The idea was taken up by [[John Philoponus]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] in late Antiquity and by the Islamic Aristotelian [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd).

''Minima naturalia'' were discussed by Scholastic and Renaissance thinkers including [[Roger Bacon]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Giles of Rome]], [[Siger of Brabant]], [[Boetius of Dacia|Boethius of Dacia]], [[Richard of Middleton]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[John of Jandun]], [[William of Ockham]], [[William Alnwick]], Walter Bury, [[Adam de Wodeham]], [[Jean Buridan]], [[Gregory of Rimini]], [[John Dumbleton]], [[Nicole Oresme]], John Marsilius Inguen,{{refn|group=n|Not to be confused with [[Marsilius of Inghen]]&lt;ref name="Murdoch2001"/&gt;}} [[John Wycliffe]], [[Albert of Saxony]], Facinus de Ast, Peter Alboinis of Mantua, [[Paul of Venice]], [[Gaetano da Thiene (philosopher)|Gaetano of Thiene]], [[Alessandro Achillini]], Luis Coronel, [[Juan de Celaya]], [[Domingo de Soto]], Didacus de Astudillo, Ludovicus Buccaferrea, [[Francisco de Toledo (Jesuit)|Francisco de Toledo]], and [[Benedict Pereira]].&lt;ref name="Murdoch2001"/&gt; Of this list, the most influential Scholastic thinkers on ''minima naturalia'' were Duns Scotus and Gregory of Rimini.&lt;ref name="Murdoch2001"/&gt;

A chief theme in later commentary is reconciling ''minima naturalia'' with the general Aristotelian principle of infinite divisibility.&lt;ref name="Chalmers2009"/&gt; Commentators like Philoponus and Aquinas reconciled these aspects of Aristotle's thought by distinguishing between mathematical and "natural" divisibility. For example, in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Physics'', Aquinas writes of natural minima that, "although a body, considered mathematically, is divisible to infinity, the natural body is not divisible to infinity. For in a mathematical body nothing but quantity is considered. And in this there is nothing repugnant to division to infinity. But in a natural body the form also is considered, which form requires a determinate quantity and also other accidents. Whence it is not possible for quantity to be found in the species of flesh except as determined within some termini."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Thomas Aquinas]]|title=In octo libros Physicorum expositio|quote=Sed dicendum quod licet corpus, mathematice acceptum, sit divisibile in infinitum, corpus tamen naturale non est divisibile in infinitum. In corpore enim mathematico non consideratur nisi quantitas, in qua nihil invenitur divisioni in infinitum repugnans; sed in corpore naturali consideratur forma naturalis, quae requirit determinatam quantitatem sicut et alia accidentia. Unde non potest inveniri quantitas in specie carnis nisi infra aliquos terminos determinata.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on corpuscularianism==
In the early modern period, Aristotelian hylomorphism fell out of favor with the rise of the [[Mechanism (philosophy)|"mechanical philosophy"]] of thinkers like [[Descartes]] and [[John Locke]], who were more sympathetic to the ancient Greek atomism of Democritus than to the natural minima of Aristotle. However, the concept of ''minima naturalia'' continued to shape philosophical thinking even among these mechanistic philosophers in the transitional centuries between the Aristotelianism of the medieval Scholastics and the worked-out atomic theory of modern scientists like Dalton.

The mechanist [[Pierre Gassendi]] discussed ''minima naturalia'' in the course of expounding his opposition to Scholastic Aristotelianism, and his own attempted reconciliation between the atomism of Epicurus and the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] faith. Aristotle's ''mininima naturalia'' became [[Corpuscularianism|"corpuscles"]] in the [[Alchemy|alchemical]] works of [[Pseudo-Geber|Geber]] and [[Daniel Sennert]], who in turn influenced the corpuscularian alchemist [[Robert Boyle]], one of the founders of modern chemistry. Boyle occasionally referred to his postulated corpuscles as ''minima naturalia''.&lt;ref name="Chalmers2009"/&gt;

The '''Nile Delta''' ({{lang-ar|دلتا النيل}} ''{{Transl|arz|Delta n-Nīl}}'' or simply {{lang|ar|الدلتا}} ''{{Transl|arz|ed-Delta}}''&lt;span style=margin-left:1px"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; is the [[River delta|delta]] formed in Northern [[Egypt]] ([[Lower Egypt]]) where the [[Nile]] River spreads out and drains into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is one of the world's largest river deltas—from [[Alexandria]] in the west to [[Port Said]] in the east, it covers {{cvt|240|km|mi}} of Mediterranean coastline and is a rich [[agricultural]] region. From north to south the delta is approximately {{cvt|160|km|mi}} in length. The Delta begins slightly down-river from [[Cairo]].

The Nile Delta is an area of the world that lacks detailed ground truth data and monitoring stations. Despite the economic importance of the Nile Delta, it could be considered as one of the most data-poor regions with respect to [[sea level rise]].&lt;ref name="Hasan 2015 649–663"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasan|first=E.|last2= Khan |first2=S.

==Geography==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
[[File:Nile River and delta from orbit.jpg|thumb|Nile River and Delta]]

From north to south, the delta is approximately {{cvt|160|km|mi}} in length. From west to east, it covers some {{cvt|240|km|mi}} of coastline. The delta is sometimes divided into sections, with the Nile dividing into two main [[distributary|distributaries]], the [[Damietta]] and the [[Rosetta]],&lt;ref name="Cooper2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Cooper|title=The Medieval Nile: Route, Navigation, and Landscape in Islamic Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYWlBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34|date=30 September 2014|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|isbn=978-977-416-614-3|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; flowing into the Mediterranean at port cities with the same name. In the past, the delta had several distributaries, but these have been lost due to flood control, silting and changing relief. One such defunct distributary is [[Wadi Tumilat]].

The [[Suez Canal]] is east of the delta and enters the coastal [[Lake Manzala]] in the north-east of the delta. To the north-west are three other coastal lakes or lagoons: [[Lake Burullus]], [[Lake Idku]] and [[Lake Mariout]].

The Nile is considered to be an "arcuate" delta (arc-shaped), as it resembles a triangle or flower when seen from above. Some scholars such as Aristotle have written that the delta was constructed for agricultural purposes due to the drying of the region of Egypt. Although such an engineering feat would be considered equivalent to a wonder of the ancient world, there is insufficient evidence to determine conclusively whether the delta is man-made or was formed naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holz |first1=Robert K |title=Man-made landforms in the Nile delta |date=1969 |publisher=American Geographical Society |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/man-made-landforms-in-the-nile-delta/oclc/38826202 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern day, the outer edges of the delta are eroding, and some coastal lagoons have seen increasing salinity levels as their connection to the Mediterranean Sea increases. Since the delta no longer receives an annual supply of nutrients and sediments from upstream due to the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]], the soils of the floodplains have become poorer, and large amounts of fertilizers are now used. [[Topsoil]] in the delta can be as much as {{cvt|70|ft|m|order=flip}} in depth.

==History==
[[File:Nile Delta Surrounding.jpg|thumb|Ancient branches of the Nile, showing Wadi Tumilat, and the lakes east of the Delta]]

People have lived in the Delta region for thousands of years, and it has been intensively farmed for at least the last five thousand years. The Delta used to flood annually, but this ended with the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]].

===Ancient branches of the Nile===
[[File:AncientEgyptJamesRennell01.jpg|thumb|alt=Ancient Nile delta.|The Nile delta at the time of [[Herodotus]], according to [[James Rennell]] (1800)]]

Records from ancient times (such as by [[Pliny the Elder]]) show that the delta had seven [[distributary|distributaries]] or branches, (from east to west):&lt;ref name="Cooper2014" /&gt; 
*the Pelusiac,
*the Tanitic (or Saitic),
*the Mendesian,
*the Phatnitic (or Phatmetic),&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Ian. ''The Exodus Enigma'' (1985), page 46. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the Sebennytic,
*the Bolbitine, and
*the Canopic (also called the Herakleotic&lt;ref&gt;e.g. at [[Callisthenes]] Alexander 1.31.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Agathodaemon{{refn|e.g. in Ptolemy, ''Geography''.}})

There are now only two main branches, due to flood control, silting and changing relief: the Damietta (corresponding to the Phatnitic) to the east, and the Rosetta (corresponding to the Bolbitine)&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, W. 'Most Ancient Egypt', p. 87, JNES, 23 (1964), 73-114.&lt;/ref&gt; in the western part of the Delta.

The [[Rosetta Stone]] was found in the Nile Delta in 1799 in the port city of Rosetta (anglicized name of [[Rosetta|Rashid]]). The delta was a major constituent of Lower Egypt. There are many archaeological sites in and around the Nile Delta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-c-h-o.org/khd/location.html Location of the site], Kafr Hassan Dawood On-Line, with map of early sites of the delta.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
[[File:Egypt 2010 population density1.png|thumb|Population density]]

About 39 million people live in the Delta region. Outside of major cities, population density in the delta averages {{cvt|1,000|PD/sqkm|abbr=off}} or more. [[Alexandria]] is the largest city in the delta with an estimated population of more than 4.5 million. Other large cities in the delta include [[Shubra El Kheima]], [[Port Said]], [[El Mahalla El Kubra]], [[El Mansoura|Mansura]], [[Tanta]], and [[Zagazig]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citypopulation.de/Egypt.html City Population website], citing Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics Egypt (web), accessed 11 April 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
[[File:Chlidonias hybrida 3 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|[[Whiskered tern]]]]

During autumn, parts of the Nile River are red with [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flowers]]. The Lower Nile (North) and the Upper Nile (South) have plants that grow in abundance. The Upper Nile plant is the Egyptian lotus, and the Lower Nile plant is the Papyrus Sedge (''[[Cyperus papyrus]]''), although it is not nearly as plentiful as it once was, and is becoming quite rare.&lt;ref name="papyrus threatened species"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cyperus papyrus |url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/164158/9 |website=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several hundred thousand water birds winter in the delta, including the world’s largest concentrations of [[little gull]]s and [[whiskered tern]]s. Other birds making their homes in the delta include [[grey heron]]s, [[Kentish plover]]s, [[Northern shoveler|shovelers]], [[cormorant]]s, [[egret]]s and [[ibis]]es.

Other animals found in the delta include [[frog]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[tortoise]]s, [[mongoose]]s, and the [[Nile monitor]]. [[Nile crocodile]]s and [[hippopotamus]], two animals which were widespread in the delta during antiquity, are no longer found there. Fish found in the delta include the [[flathead grey mullet]] and soles.

==Climate==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
{{see also|Climate of Egypt|northern coast of Egypt}}

The Delta has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: BWh) as the rest of Egypt, but its northernmost part, as is the case with the rest of the [[northern coast of Egypt]] which is the wettest region in the country, has relatively moderate temperatures, with highs usually not surpassing {{cvt|31|°C}} in the summer. Only {{cvt|100|-|200|mm|0}} of rain falls on the delta area during an average year, and most of this falls in the winter months. The delta experiences its hottest temperatures in July and August, with maximum average of {{cvt|34|°C}}. Winter temperatures are normally in the range of {{cvt|9|°C}} at nights to {{cvt|19|°C}} in the daytime. With cooler temperatures and some rain, the Nile Delta region becomes quite humid during the winter months.

==Sea level==
{{Speculation section}}
Furthermore, Egypt’s Mediterranean coastline is being swallowed up by the sea because of [[global warming]] and the rise of the sea level, and the lack of sediments being deposited since the construction of the Aswan Dam, in some places as much as {{cvt|100|yd|-1|order=flip}} a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Warming Threatens Egypt's Coastlines and the Nile Delta|url=http://www.ecoworld.com/global-warming/global-warming-egypt.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929143417/http://www.ecoworld.com/global-warming/global-warming-egypt.html|archivedate=29 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the polar ice caps melt, much of the northern delta, including the ancient port city of [[Alexandria]], will disappear under the [[Mediterranean]]. Even a {{cvt|30|cm|0}} rise in sea level will affect about 6.6% of the total land cover area in the Nile Delta region; At 1 m SLR, an estimated 887 thousand people will be at risk of flooding and displacement and about {{cvt|100|km2|sqmi|-1}} of vegetation, {{cvt|16|km2|sqmi|-1}} wetland, {{cvt|402|km2|sqmi|-1}} cropland, and {{cvt|47|km2|sqmi|-1}} of urban area land would be destroyed,&lt;ref name="Hasan 2015 649–663"/&gt; flooding approximately {{cvt|450|km2|sqmi|-1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt's Nile Delta falls prey to climate change|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/01/28/98672.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nile Delta is turning into a salty wasteland by rising sea waters, forcing some farmers off their lands and others to import sand in a desperate bid to turn back the tide. Experts warn that global warming will have a major effect in the delta on agriculture resources, tourism and human migration besides shaking the region's fragile [[ecosystems]]. Environmental damage to the Nile Delta is not yet one of Egypt's priorities, but experts say if the situation continues to deteriorate, it will trigger massive food shortages which could turn seven million people into "climate refugees" by the end of the century if climate change remains unmitigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt fertile Nile Delta falls prey to climate change|url=http://news.egypt.com/en/201001288902/news/-egypt-news/egypt-fertile-nile-delta-falls-prey-to-climate-change.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209093815/http://news.egypt.com/en/201001288902/news/-egypt-news/egypt-fertile-nile-delta-falls-prey-to-climate-change.html|archivedate=9 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the effect that the dams on the Nile have had on the delta, there has been a tremendous human effect internally with the rise of fisheries, the increased salt production, the building of roads, the heightened agricultural production, and the natural increase in human population in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=El Banna|first=Mahmoud M.|last2=Frihy|first2=Omran E.|date=2009-06-01|title=Human-induced changes in the geomorphology of the northeastern coast of the Nile delta, Egypt|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X08005011|journal=Geomorphology|series=Coastal vulnerability related to sea-level rise|volume=107|issue=1–2|pages=72–78|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2007.06.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7271">'''OPeNDAP''' is an acronym for "'''Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol'''," an endeavor focused on enhancing the retrieval of remote, structured data through a Web-based architecture and a discipline-neutral Data Access Protocol (DAP). Widely used, especially in [[Earth science]], the protocol is layered on [[HTTP]], and its current specification is DAP4,&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/DAP4_Specification DAP4 Specification]&lt;/ref&gt; though the previous DAP2 version remains broadly used. Developed and advanced (openly and collaboratively) by the non-profit [http://opendap.org/ OPeNDAP, Inc.], DAP is intended to enable remote, selective data-retrieval as an easily invoked Web service. OPeNDAP, Inc. also develops and maintains zero-cost (reference) implementations of the DAP protocol in both server-side and client-side software. 

"OPeNDAP" often is used in place of "DAP" to denote the protocol but also may refer to an entire DAP-based data-retrieval architecture. Other DAP-centered architectures, such as [https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/ THREDDS] and ERDDAP,&lt;ref&gt;[https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html The NOAA GEO-IDE UAF ERDDAP]&lt;/ref&gt; exhibit significant interoperability with one another as well as with systems employing OPeNDAP's own (open-source) servers and software.

A DAP client can be an ordinary browser or even a spreadsheet, though with limited functionality (see OPeNDAP's Web page on [https://www.opendap.org/support/OPeNDAP-clients Available Client Software]). More typically, DAP clients are:
* Data-analysis or data-visualization tools (such as [[MATLAB]], [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]], [[Panoply]], [[GrADS]], [[IDV]], [[Ferret Data Visualization and Analysis|Ferret]] and ncBrowse&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/epic/java/ncBrowse/ A Graphical netCDF File Browser]&lt;/ref&gt;) which their authors have adapted to enable DAP-based data input;
* Similarly adapted Web applications (such as Dapper Data Viewer, aka DChart)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/epic/software/dchart/ OPeNDAP software]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similarly adapted end-user programs (in common languages)

Regardless of their types, and whether developed commercially or by an end-user, clients almost universally link to DAP servers through ''libraries'' that implement the DAP2 or DAP4 protocol in one language or another. OPeNDAP offers open-source libraries in [[C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], but many clients rely on community developed libraries such as [https://github.com/pydap/pydap PyDAP] or, especially, the [[NetCDF]] suite. Developed and maintained by the Unidata Program at the [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|UCAR]] in multiple programming languages, all [[NetCDF]] libraries include embedded capabilities for retrieving (array-style) data from DAP servers.

A data-using client references a [[data set]] by its URL and requests metadata or content by issuing (usually through an embedded DAP library) an HTTP request to a DAP server. Content requests usually are ''preceded'' by requests for metadata describing the structure and other details about the referenced data set. With this information, the client may construct DAP constraint expressions&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/DAP4:_Specification_Volume_1#Constraints DAP constraint expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; to retrieve specific content (i.e., subsets) from the source. OPeNDAP servers offer various types of responses, depending on the specific form of the client's request, including XML, JSON, HTML and ASCII. In response to requests for ''content'', OPeNDAP servers can respond with multi-part mime documents that include a binary portion with [[NetCDF]] or DAP-native encoding. (These binary forms offer compact means to deliver large volumes of content, and the DAP-native form may even be streamed if desired.)

OPeNDAP's software for building DAP servers (on top of [[Apache]]) is dubbed Hyrax and includes ''adapters'' that facilitate serving a wide variety of source data. DAP servers most frequently enable (remote) access to (large) [[Hierarchical Data Format|HDF]] or NetCDF files, but the source data can exist in databases or other formats, including user-defined ones. When source data are organized as files, DAP retrievals enable, via [[subsetting]], finer-grained access than does the [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]]. Furthermore, OPeNDAP servers can aggregate subsets from multiple files for delivery in a single retrieval. Taken together, subsetting, aggregation and streaming can yield substantial data-access efficiencies, even in the presence of slow networks.

OPeNDAP and other DAP servers are used operationally in government agencies, including [[NASA]] and [[NOAA]], for providing access to [[Earth science]] data, including satellite imagery and other high-volume information sources. The DAP data model embraces a comprehensive set of data structures, including multidimensional arrays and nested sequences (i.e., records), complemented by a correspondingly rich set of constraint expressions. Hence the OPeNDAP data-retrieval architecture has demonstrated utility across a broad range of scientific data types, including data generated via simulations and data generated via observations (whether remotely sensed or measured in situ).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2909">The '''optical conductivity''' is a material property, which links the [[Current (electricity)|current]] density to the [[electric field]] for general [[frequency|frequencies]]. In this sense, this [[linear response function]] is a generalization of the [[electrical conductivity]], which is usually considered in the static limit, i.e., for a time-independent (or sufficiently slowly varying) electric field.  While the static electrical conductivity is vanishingly small in [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]]s (such as [[Diamond]] or [[Porcelain]]), the optical conductivity always remains finite in some frequency intervals (above the '''optical gap''' in the case of insulators); the total '''optical weight''' can be inferred from [[sum rule in quantum mechanics|sum rules]]. The optical conductivity is closely related to the [[dielectric function]], the generalization of the [[dielectric constant]] to arbitrary frequencies. 

Only in the simplest case (coarse-graining, long-wavelength limit, cubic symmetry of the material), these properties can be considered as (complex-valued) scalar functions of the frequency only. Then, the electric current density &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; (a three-dimensional vector), the scalar optical conductivity &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and the electric field vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; are linked by the equation 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}(\omega) = \sigma(\omega) \mathbf{E}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

while the dielectric function &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; relates the [[electrical displacement]] to the electric field:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}(\omega) = \varepsilon(\omega) \mathbf{E}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

In [[SI]] units, this implies the following connection between the two linear response functions:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(\omega) = \varepsilon_0 + \frac{i \sigma(\omega)}{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]] and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[imaginary unit]].

The optical conductivity is most often measured in the optical frequency ranges via the [[reflectivity]] of polished samples under normal incidence (in combination with a [[Kramers–Kronig relations|Kramers–Kronig analysis]]) or using variable incidence angles. For samples that can be prepared in thin slices, higher precision is usually obtainable using optical transmission experiments. In order to get more complete information about the electronic properties of the material of interest, such measurements have to be combined with other techniques that work in remaining frequency ranges, e.g., in the static limit or at [[Microwave spectroscopy|microwave]] frequencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6430">Province flowers are [[species]] of [[plant]]s selected to represent each [[province of Sweden]]. The origin of province flowers came from the [[United States|American]] idea of [[state flowers]], and was brought to Sweden by August Wickström and Paul Petter Waldenström in 1908. Waldenström published the proposal to introduce province flowers in the May 288, 1908 edition of the newspaper ''[[Stockholms Dagblad]]'', and requested suggestions of species from the country's [[Botany|botanic]]s. A list was put together on June 7, 1908, by professor Veit B. Wittrock from the Botanical Garden in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="arbetarbladet"/&gt; [[Scania]] and [[Hälsingland]] violently opposed the plants that were selected to represent them; Scania was given [[European Beech]] but wanted [[oxeye daisy]], while Hälsingland was given [[Scots Pine]] but wanted [[flax]]. Erik E:son Hammar, a pastor and politician in Sweden, granted the two provinces' wish to change their province flowers in 1909.&lt;ref name="dalarna"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamrin|first=Örjan|title=Dalarnas hembygdsbok|editor=Raihle, Jan |editor2=Ståhl, Elisabeth|publisher=Dalarnas fornminnes- och hembygdsförbund|location=[[Falun]]|date=2003|volume=73|chapter=Vilken är Dalarnas landskapsblomma?|isbn=91-87466-66-X|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still debate amongst several other provinces over which species should represent them and they have therefore been given two province flowers.&lt;ref name="arbetarbladet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arbetarbladet.se/merlasning/ulfivarshistoria/1.1028255|title=Den 100-åriga liljekonvaljen|last=Nilsson|first=Ulf|date=May 10, 2009|work=[[Arbetarbladet]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-06-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511170921/http://arbetarbladet.se/merlasning/ulfivarshistoria/1.1028255|archivedate=May 11, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Second Fiji Expedition''' was an 1859 [[United States Navy]] operation against the native [[warrior]]s of [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] on the island of [[Waya, Fiji Islands|Waya]] in [[Fiji]]. Following the death of two American traders on Waya, the [[Pacific Squadron]] launched a [[punitive expedition]] against the Wayans and defeated them in a pitched battle at the village of [[Somatti]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.navalhistory.org/2010/10/09/irregular-warfare-and-the-vandalia-expedition-in-fiji-1859/ Irregular Warfare and the Vandalia expedition in Fiji, 1859 | Naval History Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1859, two American citizens on Waya were killed and [[canibalism|canibalized]] by the natives so when word of the incident reached the American consulate at [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau]], the Pacific Squadron sent the [[sloop-of-war]] {{USS|Vandalia|1828|2}}. The warship arrived at Ovalau on 2 October 1859 and it was decided that in order to get to Waya a vessel with a shallower draft was needed. To solve this problem Commander Sinclair chartered the [[schooner]] ''Mechanic'' and placed her under the command of veteran Lieutenant [[Charles Caldwell (naval officer)|Charles Caldwell]]. A force of 10 [[Marine (military)|marine]]s, forty sailors and a 12-pounder [[howitzer]] were mustered for the landing on Waya.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Long, pg. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

A few Fijian guides and three American merchant sailors also participated. One of whom was [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Josiah Knowles]] of the [[clipper ship]] [[Wild Wave (clipper)|''Wild Wave'']] which was wrecked off [[Oeno Island]]. Knowles and 40 others were marooned on the island until being rescued by ''Vandalia'' and taken to Fiji.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

==Expedition==
The expedition left Ovalau on 6 October 1859 and sailed west around the northern end of the main island of [[Viti Levu]] to Waya. During their passage to the island, Lieutenant Caldwell’s men heard many stories from towns and villages about the warriors of Waya. A letter was also received from the Wayan chiefs responsible for the deaths of the two American traders. The message said, “''Do you suppose we have killed the two white men for nothing? No, we killed them and we have eaten them. We are great warriors, and we delight in war.''” Caldwell later wrote, “''...and woe to the members of any strange tribe that falls into their hands... to be clubbed to death and eaten is the only alternative for the captive. It is not a matter of surprise that the tribes along our route learned with feelings of satisfaction the nature of our expedition.''”&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;
&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;
[[File:USS Vandalia (1828) sketch.jpg|200px|left|thumb|{{USS|Vandalia|1828|2}} during the [[American Civil War]].]]

At 03:00 on 9 October, the Americans made a landing and marched inland toward the village of Somatti over tropical and mountainous terrain. While climbing through the mountains, the 12-pounder was destroyed and left behind when it fell {{convert|2300|ft|m|-2}} down the side of a hill as the expedition tried to pull it up.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;
&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

When the column reached Somatti, it was daytime and over 300 native warriors were positioned in front of the village for defense. The Wayans wore white robes and were armed with clubs, rocks, spears, bows and some muskets. The Americans had swords and carbine rifles and the battle began when Lieutenant Caldwell ordered a flanking maneuver on the left side of the mass of warriors. This routed the natives and they dispersed themselves amongst the town or fled into the jungle. After, [[Master's Mate]] [[John K. Bartlett]], who led a group of sailors, sang "Red, White and Blue" and let out three cheers before charging and capturing the village.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

The crew of the 12-pounder, with no gun to fire, took charge of burning the village and over 115 huts were destroyed. Marines under Lieutenant [[Alan Ramsey (marine officer)|Alan Ramsey]] participated by providing a rearguard for the sailors, they repulsed a final Wayan attack from the jungle after they had regrouped. In all fourteen warriors, including the two chiefs, were counted dead after a fierce half an hour battle. At least 36 others were wounded. Two marines were wounded by musketry but survived, two sailors were hurt badly by rocks, one other marine was hit in the leg with an arrow and a sailor from ''Wild Wave'' was hurt as well.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

After the battle the Americans took until 16 October to return to the coast where the ''Mechanic'' was waiting. They stopped at friendly Fijian fishing villages and spread the news of their victory. Caldwell noted that two [[ramrod]]s and one [[bayonet]] were lost during the march, and a large amount of ammunition was used in battle. The lieutenant received much credit for the operation which is considered one of the most impressive military campaigns launched by the United States in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] during the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

The '''Silk Letter Movement''' (تحریکِ ریشمی رومال) refers to a movement organised by the [[Deobandi]] leaders between 1913 and 1920, aimed at freeing India from the [[British Raj|British rule]] by allying with [[Ottoman Turkey]], [[Imperial Germany]], and [[Afghanistan]]. The  plot was uncovered by [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] with the capture of letters from [[Ubaidullah Sindhi]], one of the Deobandi leaders then in [[Afghanistan]], to [[Mahmud al Hasan]], another leader then in [[Persia]]. The letters were written in [[silk]] cloth, hence the name.&lt;ref name=Qureshi&gt;Pan-Islam in British Indian Politics: A Study of the Khilafat Movement, 1918-1924.(Social, Economic and Political Studies of the Middle East and Asia). M. Naeem Qureshi. p79,80,81,82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sufi Saints and State Power: The Pirs of Sind, 1843-1947.Sarah F. D. Ansari.p82&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad Mian Mansoor Ansari]] went to Hejaz with Mahmood Hasan in September 1915. He returned to India in April 1916 with Ghalib Nama (Silk Letter) which he showed to freedom fighters in India and the autonomous area and then took it to Kabul where he reached in June 1916.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.darululoom-deoband.com/urdu/books/tmp/1388990860%20Silk%20Letter%20Movement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of [[World War I]], [[Ubaidullah Sindhi]] and [[Maulana Mehmud Hasan|Mehmud Hasan]] (principal of the [[Darul Uloom Deoband]]) had proceeded to Kabul in October 1915 with plans to initiate a Muslim insurrection in the tribal belt of India. For this purpose, Ubaid'Allah was to propose that the [[Habibullah Khan|Amir of Afghanistan]] declares war against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] while Mahmud al Hasan sought German and Turkish help. Hasan proceeded to [[Hijaz]]. Ubaid Allah, in the meantime, was able to establish friendly relations with Amir. As the plans unfolded in what came to be called the Silk Letter Movement, Ubaid'Allah was able to establish friendly relations with Amir. At Kabul, Ubaid'Allah, along with some students who had preceded him to make way to [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] to join the [[Caliph]]'s "''[[Jihad]]''" against Britain, decided that the pan-Islamic cause was to be best served by focussing on the [[Indian Freedom Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ansari|1986|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Berlin committee|Berlin-Indian committee]] (which became the ''Indian Independence Committee'' after 1915) also resulted in an [[Niedermayer-Hentig mission|Indo-German-Turkish mission]] to the Indo-Iranian border to encourage the tribes to strike against British interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ansari|1986|p=514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strachan788&gt;{{Harvnb|Strachan|2001|p=788}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group met the Deobandis in [[Kabul]] in December 1915. The mission, along with bringing members of the Indian movement right to India's border, also brought messages from the [[Kaiser]], [[Enver Pasha]] and the displaced [[Khedive]] of [[Egypt]], Abbas Hilmi expressing support for Pratap's mission and inviting the Amir to move against India&lt;ref name=Sims-Williams120&gt;{{Harvnb|Sims-Williams|1980|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seidt|2001|p=1,3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission's immediate aim was to rally the Amir against [[British India]]&lt;ref name=Sims-Williams120/&gt;  and to obtain from the Afghan Government a right of free passage.&lt;ref name=Ansari516&gt;{{harvnb|Ansari|1986|p=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; But after the leakage of the plan, the top Deobandi leaders were arrested—Mahmudul-Hasan was arrested from Makkah and together with Husayn Ahmad, was exiled to Malta, from where, he was released in his later stages of [[Tuberculosis|T.B]].

In January 2013, The [[President of India]], [[Pranab Mukherjee]] released a [[Commemorative stamp|commemorative postage stamp]] on the Silk Letter Movement to acknowledge and appreciate the sacrifices of such groups for the [[Indian independence movement]].&lt;ref&gt;http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=91529&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Thalia''' or '''Thaleia''' ({{IPAc-en||θ|ə|ˈ|l|aɪ|ə|}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardner |first1=Dorsey |title=Webster's Condensed Dictionary |date=1887 |publisher=George Routledge and Sons |location=Broadway, Ludgate Hill |page=776 |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aU0yAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA776 |accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; {{lang-grc-gre|Θάλεια}} ''Tháleia'' or Θάλια ''Thália'', "the Joyous, the Flourishing", from θάλλειν / thállein, "to flourish, to be green") is a nymph, the child of [[Hephaestus]]. She is also given as an anthropomorphic secondary deity of plant life and shoots, possibly as the culmination of the transmission of knowledge on volcanic ash's use as a fertiliser, characteristic of ancient [[viticulture]] in volcanic soils such as those of the island of [[Santorini]].

The tradition surrounding her is confused, but she is probably confused with the [[Thalia (Muse)|Muse]], [[Thalia (Grace)|Grace]] or [[Thalia (Nereid)|Nereid]] of the same name. [[Macrobius]]'s ''Saturnales'' (song V) states how [[Zeus]] seized this Thalia whilst he was in the form of an eagle, as he did with [[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]], [[Leto]] and [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]. He then made love to her near the river Symethe on [[Sicily]] and then buried her in the ground to avoid [[Hera]]'s jealousy. Her twin children, the [[Palici]], were thus born from the earth, though other authors make the Palici the sons of [[Hephaestus]].

[[Image:USS Brooklyn (1858) at Naval Review.jpg|300px|thumb|right|USS ''Brooklyn'' [[dressed overall]] and with her [[Yard (sailing)|yards]] manned at the [[Naval Review]] on April 29, 1889.]]

'''USS ''Brooklyn'' (1858)''' was a [[sloop-of-war]] authorized by the [[U.S. Congress]] and commissioned in 1859. ''Brooklyn'' was active in [[Caribbean]] operations until the start of the [[American Civil War]] at which time she became an active participant in the [[Union blockade]] of the [[Confederate States of America]].

With her one 10-inch gun and twenty 9-inch guns, ''Brooklyn '' was a formidable fighting ship that could  deliver damaging [[broadside]]s, and served on the Atlantic Ocean coast as well as the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]] in intercepting [[blockade runner]]s. ''Brooklyn'' also served gallantly attacking Confederate forts and other installations on the [[Mississippi River]].

Post-war, ''Brooklyn'' remained active, serving for some years in the European theatre, as well as [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigating the globe]]. She was retired in 1889 and sold in 1890 after having well served her country for over three decades.

== Construction authorized by Congress ==

''Brooklyn'' – the first ship so-named by the [[U.S. Navy]] – was the first of five screw sloops of war authorized by the U.S. Congress on March 3, 1857; laid down later that year by the firm of [[Jacob Aaron Westervelt|Jacob A. Westervelt]] and Son; launched in 1858; and commissioned on January 26, 1859, Capt. [[David G. Farragut]] in command.

== Caribbean operations ==

=== Investigating conditions in Haiti ===

On February 5, ''Brooklyn'' got underway for a trial run to [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], where she arrived on the 11th. Following a week's visit to that port, she headed for the [[West Indies]] to investigate conditions in [[Haiti]] where liberal forces had ousted Emperor [[Soulouque]] and installed [[Fabre Geffrard]] as President.

Farragut found that the people of Haiti were delighted to be free of the oppressive rule of the former monarch and with the end of a racial war that had bled their nation. Upon the recommendation of the American consul, Farragut sailed for the [[Isthmus of Panama]].

=== Mexican operations ===

After visiting [[Colón, Panama|Aspinwall]], ''Brooklyn'' set a course for the Mexican coast and reached [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] early in April. The legal president of Mexico, [[Benito Juárez]] – who had been driven from Mexico City by forces of General [[Miguel Miramón]] of the Clerical Party—was making that seaport his temporary capital.

The United States, which recognized the Juarez government, had sent former [[Maryland]] [[Congressman]] [[Robert Milligan McLane]] to Veracruz as the American minister and ordered Farragut to make ''Brooklyn'' available to McLane so that he might keep abreast of developments in the ongoing civil war and assist American consuls who were striving to protect U.S. citizens and property. During part of the time the screw [[sloop of war]] lay off Veracruz, McLane resided on board.

In  July  ''Brooklyn'' proceeded to [[Pensacola, Florida]], for coal, provisions, and water, and she reached that port on the 15th. As soon as she finished replenishing, the ship returned to Veracruz, but she was back at Pensacola again by September 7. From there, she sailed for New York and reached the [[New York Navy Yard]] on the 26th of that month.

=== Continued Mexican operations ===

With McLane—who had returned to the United States for consultations with the [[U.S. Secretary of State]] and the U.S. President—on board, ''Brooklyn'' departed [[New York Harbor]] on November 8 and headed back toward the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. She arrived at Veracruz on the 21st and remained in port while McLane negotiated an agreement with the Juárez Government. After the treaty was signed on December 12, she got underway again and proceeded to [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, where she arrived on the 18th.

With her bunkers full once more, she headed down the Mississippi River on Christmas Eve and crossed the gulf to Veracruz. However, in mid- January  she reembarked McLane and took him to New Orleans so that he might catch a train for Washington, D.C., where he was needed to explain the treaty he had negotiated with Juárez to doubtful senators.

From New Orleans, ''Brooklyn'' proceeded to Pensacola to prepare for a return to Mexican waters. However, before McLane could get back to the Gulf Coast from Washington, orders reached Pensacola sending her north. She stood out to sea on February 19, 1860 and reached New York City on the 27th. Underway again on March 11, she arrived at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], the following afternoon and there awaited McLane whom she embarked and delivered back to Veracruz on the 28th.

=== Isthmus survey operations ===

The steamer operated along the Mexican coast through the spring and into the summer carrying McLane to various ports where he conferred with the American consuls. Late in  July  she left the Mexican coast and returned to Norfolk early in August. There, she received orders to prepare for a voyage carrying members of a scientific expedition to the Gulf of Mexico to find a route across the isthmus of [[Chiriquí Province|Chiriqui]]. She sailed on the 13th and reached Chiriqui, Boca del Toro, [[Panama]], on the 24th. But for a run to Aspinwall from September 12 to 17, she remained off the expedition base at Chiriqui until mid-October when she returned to Aspinwall. There on October 20, Capt. [[William S. Walker]] relieved Farragut in command.

== Civil War service ==

=== Failure to re-supply Fort Sumter ===

Shortly thereafter, ''Brooklyn'' returned to [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]], and she remained in the Norfolk area through the end of 1860 while enthusiasm for secession swept through the deep South in the wake of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s election to the presidency. Early in January 1861, Capt. Walker received orders sending ''Brooklyn'' to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], with messages for the steamer ''Star of the West'' which had sailed south to relieve beleaguered [[Fort Sumter]]. However, when she reached [[Charleston Harbor]], she found the channel leading into port obstructed and learned that the resupply effort had failed. Consequently, she returned to Hampton Roads.

=== Gulf of Mexico operations ===

The following month, she received orders for a similar mission which she carried out with great success, relieving [[Fort Pickens]], at Pensacola, Florida. After helping to thwart Confederate attempts to wrest that highly valuable Federal toehold on strategic Florida territory from Union hands, ''Brooklyn'' sailed west along the Gulf of Mexico coast to establish the blockade of the Mississippi Passes.

She, {{USS|Powhatan|1850|6}}, and two [[gunboat]]s made a number of captures off Pass a l'Outre and Southwest Pass, but so many ships were getting by them that Comdr. [[Charles Henry Poor]] – who relieved Capt. Walker as ''Brooklyn's'' commander in April 1861—tried to go upriver to the [[Head of Passes]] where traffic might better be throttled. Low water, however, caused her to run aground twice before she abandoned the effort.

On June 30, 1861, the Confederate warship [[CSS Sumter|CSS ''Sumter'']] raced out of Pass a l'Outre while ''Brooklyn'' had left her station in pursuit of another ship. Upon seeing the fleet Southern cruiser, ''Brooklyn'' forsook her first chase and used full sail and maximum steam in an attempt to overtake ''Sumter'' but to no avail, for her quarry soon escaped over the horizon and out of sight. Badly in need of repairs, ''Brooklyn'' sailed north late in the autumn and was decommissioned at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]].

=== Second Gulf operations ===

Recommissioned on December 19, 1861, the screw sloop—commanded by Capt. Thomas T. Craven—dropped down the [[Delaware River]] on the 27th and stood out to sea, bound for the gulf. After stopping at [[Key West, Florida]], she reached [[Ship Island, Mississippi]], on January 22, 1862. On February 2 she sailed for Pass a l'Outre where, on the 19th, she captured the steamer ''Magnolia'' which was attempting to slip out to sea with 1,200 bales of cotton.

Meanwhile, the Navy Department had divided its forces in the gulf into two organizations: the [[East Gulf Blockading Squadron]], commanded by Flag Officer [[William W. McKean]], and the [[West Gulf Blockading Squadron]], commanded by Flag Officer David G. Farragut who arrived at Ship Island in March. Besides carrying out the blockade, Farragut had been instructed to lead a fleet of warships up the Mississippi River to capture New Orleans, Louisiana.

After spending the latter part of March and the first part of April getting his deep-draft ocean-going vessels over the bar and into the river, Farragut moved his fleet up the Mississippi to a position just out of range of the guns that guarded the river at Confederate [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip|Forts Jackson and St. Philip]].

=== Attack on Forts St. Philip and Jackson ===
[[File:Brooklyn and Manassas.jpg|thumb|left|''Brooklyn'' under attack by CSS ''Manassas'']]
Attached to Farragut's force was a flotilla of small sailing vessels each of which carried a 13-inch mortar. In mid-April these little warships—mostly schooners—began a bombardment of the Southern forts and continued the attack until the early hours of April 24 when they increased the tempo of their firing to their maximum rate while Farragut's deep-draft [[men-of-war]] got underway for a dash past the Southern guns. ''Brooklyn'' was

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... struck several times before she could bring her guns to bear. As soon as that could be accomplished we opened fire upon Fort Jackson and also upon Fort St. Philip, fighting both batteries at intervals. We were fouled by one of our gunboats, but received no damage. The ram [[CSS Manassas|''Manassas'']] attempted to sink us by running into us, but did us little injury. A [[fire raft]] came down the river upon us, but we succeeded in crossing it without injury. We came near getting foul of some hulks and rafts of logs, which kept us under fire longer than we otherwise should have been.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eight men from ''Brooklyn'' were killed in the action and 21 wounded before she reached comparative safety beyond the range of the Rebel artillery. Later that day, after making needed repairs, Farragut's warships resumed their movement upriver and reached New Orleans on April 25. When that city had surrendered, ''Brooklyn''—which had been damaged more seriously by her collision with the ram ''Manassas'' than Craven had at first realized—received a patch of heavy planking some 24 feet long over a long tear in her hull. One of ''Brooklyn's'' sailors, Quartermaster [[James Buck]], was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions in the battle.&lt;ref name="moh1"/&gt;

=== Capture of New Orleans ===

Farragut's orders called for him to clear the Mississippi of all Confederate forces afloat and of all defensive works along the river banks while moving up stream until meeting another Union squadron—commanded by Flag Officer [[Charles Henry Davis]] – which had begun fighting its way downriver from [[Cairo, Illinois]]. Hence, early in  May  after [[Union Army]] troops commanded by Major General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] had arrived in transports and had taken over New Orleans, ''Brooklyn'' and six other warships ascended the river.

[[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], surrendered with no resistance, but [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], proved to be another matter. The [[Confederate Army]] had so fortified its riverside hills that it could not be taken without the support of a strong land force. Since the Union Army did not have a sufficient number of troops available in the region to accomplish this purpose, Farragut's men-of-war returned to New Orleans.

=== Attack on Vicksburg ===

There awaiting him were orders from [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Gideon Welles]] reiterating the importance of a junction with Davis's force above Vicksburg, Mississippi. Thus the Union warships again reversed course and painfully worked their way upstream to a position just out of range of Vicksburg's guns. This time they had the support of the [[Mortar Flotilla]] which conducted an intense preliminary bombardment of the riverside fortress. At two hours past midnight on June 28, the fleet got underway in two columns and began steaming up stream.

Unfortunately, the steamers that had towed the mortar [[schooner]]s up stream got in the way of ''Brooklyn'' and two gunboats and prevented their getting upstream past the Vicksburg batteries. As a result they drew much of the Southern fire while Farragut's other ships pushed upstream and out of range. Shortly before dawn, ''Brooklyn'' dropped down stream to a place of greater safety and remained there to be on hand to support Farragut in any way possible should an opportunity to do so occur before the [[Flag Officer]] returned below in mid-July. As the hot summer days passed, more and more illness broke out among the ship's crew and the falling water level in the river made it necessary for the ship to retire downstream toward New Orleans.

Meanwhile, on July 2, Capt [[Henry H. Bell]] relieved Capt. Craven in command of ''Brooklyn''. On August 6, the screw sloop engaged Confederate batteries at [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana]], driving the Southern artillerymen from their guns; and, on the 9th and 10th, she took part in combined operations which partially destroyed that city in reprisal for [[guerrilla attacks]] on Union shipping from that town.

=== Temporary East Coast assignment ===

Soon thereafter, ''Brooklyn'' left the Mississippi and steamed to Pensacola for more permanent repairs to the damage she had suffered while fighting her way past Forts Jackson and St. Philip and colliding with Manassas. On October 6, orders sent the ship to blockade duty off [[Mobile Bay]], and she spent the rest of 1862 in that vicinity alert for blockade runners and the appearance of Confederate cruisers which might threaten Union gunboats guarding the coast.

=== Action in the Gulf of Mexico ===

Early in January 1863, when word reached Farragut that a surprise Southern attack against Union warships at [[Galveston, Texas]], had recaptured that port and broken the blockade there, he placed Bell in charge of the small force sent to reestablish Union control. Shoal water prevented ''Brooklyn'' from participating in a bombardment of Confederate gun positions in Galveston harbor on January 10; and on the night of the 11th, [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']] sank ''Brooklyn's'' most formidable consort the sidewheel steamer {{USS|Hatteras|1861|6}}, in a fierce but rapid engagement some 30 miles off Galveston. This setback prompted Bell to give up his plan to retake that port pending the arrival of powerful shallow draft reinforcements. ''Brooklyn'' did continue to blockade the Texas city into the summer.

On 25 May, Bell " ... left Commander [[James Robert Madison Mullany]] in the {{USS|Bienville|1861|6}} in charge of the blockade of Galveston ... and proceeded down the coast of Texas as far as the [[Rio Grande]], to ascertain the amount of interior coast trade and its exit ...

&lt;blockquote&gt;"On the morning of the 27th, ''Brooklyn'' captured the 17-ton, cotton-laden sloop, ''Blazer'', which was heading for [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], Mexico. The next day, boats from ''Brooklyn'' took the small sloop ''Kate''. Three days later, she anchored off the bar outside [[Brazos Island|Brazos Santiago, Texas]]", and sent " ... an expedition of four boats and 87 men ... to capture vessels there …" &lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the Union boats approached Point Isabel, the Southerners " ... set fire to a large schooner." They brought out the 100-ton schooner Star and a fishing scow. At Point Isabel, they captured the 100-ton, British sloop ''Victoria'' of [[Jamaica]] but ran that vessel aground while attempting to get out to sea and so burned her. After the landing parties had returned to the ship, ''Brooklyn'' returned to Galveston.

Late in  July  she returned to New Orleans where, on August 2, Lt. Comdr. [[Chester Hatfield]] relieved Bell in command to free the commodore to take temporary command of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron while Farragut returned home in {{USS|Hartford|1858|6}} for a well-earned leave. On the 10th, Capt. [[George F. Emmons]] relieved Hatfield and sailed ''Brooklyn'' north on the 13th to receive badly needed repairs. She emerged from the Southwest Pass the next day; touched at [[Port Royal, South Carolina]], on the 21st, at Charleston, South Carolina, on the 22d, and reached the New York Navy Yard on the 25th.

=== Battle of Mobile Bay ===

Recommissioned on April 14, 1864, ''Brooklyn'' put to sea on 10 May under the command of Capt. [[James Alden, Jr.]] and rejoined her squadron off Mobile Bay on the last day of the month. There Farragut—who had resumed command—was eager to capture that strategic port, but was held up by the perennial lack of available Union Army troops—needed for the projected combined operation. He was also awaiting the arrival of monitors to strengthen the squadron for the forthcoming battle. ''Brooklyn'' helped to blockade Mobile Bay while Farragut waited for deficiencies to be corrected. Finally, late in July she and her squadron mates received orders to make ready for the long awaited attack.

On the morning of August 5, Farragut took his squadron of 18 ships, including four [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]], against the heavy Confederate defenses of Mobile Bay. Soon after 6&amp;nbsp;am, the Union ships crossed the bar and moved into the bay. The four monitors formed a column to [[starboard]] of the wooden ships in order to take most of the fire from [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]], which they had to pass at close range. ''Brooklyn'' led the second column,&lt;ref name=hmdb&gt;{{cite web|title=The Battle of Mobile Bay: "A Deadly Rain of Shot and Shell"|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=68815|website=Historical Marker Database|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of the seven smaller wooden ships lashed to the port side of the larger wooden screw steamers, as in the passage of Fort Hudson.

Shortly before 7 o'clock, ''Tecumseh'' opened fire on Fort Morgan,&lt;ref name=hmdb2&gt;{{cite web|title=The Battle of Mobile Bay: "Damn the Torpedoes!"|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=69412|website=Historical Marker Database|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the action quickly became general. As the 4-ship Confederate squadron engaged the attackers, a terrific explosion rocked the Union monitor {{USS|Tecumseh|1863|6}}. She careened violently and went down in seconds, the victim of one of the much-feared [[Naval mine|torpedoes]] (Naval mine) laid by the Confederates for harbor defense.&lt;ref name=hmdb2 /&gt;

Alden, in ''Brooklyn'', was to ''Tecumseh's'' port when the disaster occurred; the heavy steamer stopped and began backing to clear "a row of suspecious {{sic}} looking buoys" directly under ''Brooklyn's'' bow. The entire line of wooden vessels was drifting into confusion immediately under the guns of Fort Morgan. Farragut, lashed in the rigging to observe the action over the smoke billowing from the guns, acted promptly and resolutely. The only course was the boldest—through the torpedo field. "Damn the torpedoes", he ordered "full speed ahead." His [[flagship]] ''Hartford'' swept past ''Brooklyn'' into the rows of torpedoes; the fleet followed. The Union force steamed into the bay.&lt;ref name=hmdb2 /&gt;

In the ensuing battle, the ironclad [[CSS Tennessee (1863)|CSS ''Tennessee'']] attempted in vain to ram ''Brooklyn''. The Union fleet dispatched three of the Confederate ships, leaving ''Tennessee'' as the only defender. The lone ironclad then engaged the entire Union fleet. After a fierce battle lasting more than an hour, ''Tennessee'' was forced to surrender, resulting in a Union victory.

During the battle that lasted a bit more than three hours, ''Brooklyn'' suffered 54 men killed and 43 wounded while firing 183 projectiles. Twenty-three of ''Brooklyn'''s sailors and marines were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for their part in the battle. Their names were:&lt;ref name="moh1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moh2"/&gt;

=== Attack on Fort Fisher ===

After spending the next few weeks helping reduce the Confederate land works guarding the entrance, ''Brooklyn'' departed Mobile Bay on September 6 and headed for Hampton Roads for service in the [[North Atlantic Blockading Squadron]]. Soon thereafter, Rear Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]] began to concentrate his warships for a joint Army-Navy operation against [[Fort Fisher, North Carolina]]. The fort guarded the approaches to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], the last major Confederate port still open for blockade runners. ''Brooklyn'' took part in the attack against that Southern stronghold which began with a bombardment on Christmas Eve. She helped to cover the landing of troops the next day, but the whole effort was brought to naught later that day when the Union Army commanding officer, Major General Benjamin F. Butler, decided that his forces could not carry the Confederate works and ordered his soldiers to re-embark.

Porter strongly disagreed with this decision in dispatches to Washington. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] responded by placing a new commander over a larger Army force earmarked for another attempt to take Fort Fisher. ''Brooklyn'' was in the task force that arrived off Fort Fisher on January 13, 1865, and her guns supported the attack until the fort surrendered on the 15th. Since this victory completed the last major task of the Union Navy during the Civil War, ''Brooklyn'' sailed north and was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on January 31, 1865.

== Post-war service ==

=== South Atlantic coast operations ===

Laid up under repairs for the remaining months of the conflict, the screw sloop was recommissioned on October 4, 1865, Comdr. [[Thomas H. Patterson]] in command. She stood out to sea on the 27th and proceeded via the Gulf of Mexico to [[Bahia, Brazil]]. Following almost two years of service along the Atlantic coast of South America, she returned to [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, late in the summer of 1867 and was decommissioned there on September 11 and placed in ordinary.

=== Extended Mediterranean tour ===

Recommissioned on August 24, 1870, Capt. [[John Guest (naval officer)|John Guest]] in command, ''Brooklyn'' sailed eastward across the Atlantic and spent almost three years in European waters, primarily in the [[Mediterranean]]. After returning home in the summer of 1873, she was decommissioned at New York City on July 26 for repairs.

=== Assigned as flagship of the South Atlantic squadron ===

Reactivated on January 20, 1874, the veteran warship operated along the southern coast of the United States until autumn when she entered the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] to be fitted out for service as flagship of the [[South Atlantic Squadron]]. She got underway for the coast of Brazil on January 23, 1875 and operated in South American waters protecting American interests until heading home on December 7. Following service in the [[Home Squadron]], she was decommissioned at New York City on July 21, 1876 and laid up.

Recommissioned on November 11, 1881, ''Brooklyn'' sailed on December 7 for [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, and another tour of duty with the South Atlantic Squadron. On February 5, 1882, she departed that port and headed for the [[Strait of Magellan]]. During the month, she visited [[Possession Bay]], Gregory Bay, Elizabeth Island, and Sandy Point before departing Possession Bay on March 2, 1882 and returning via [[Stanley, Falkland Islands]], to Montevideo where she arrived late in March.

While operating out of that port during the next 18 months, she made two voyages to Santa Cruz, [[Patagonia]], and one to [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]], before getting underway on September 28, 1883 for [[Cape Town]], Africa. During her time in African waters, she also visited Tomatave, [[Madagascar]]; [[Zanzibar]]; the Johanna Islands; Nassi be Island; Mojanga, Madagascar; [[Mozambique]]; Mourondava, Nos Veh, and Tuellear Bay, Madagascar, and [[Port Elizabeth]], Africa, before departing Cape Town on March 13, 1884. After proceeding homeward via [[Saint Helena|St. Helena Island]], Montevideo, and Rio de Janeiro, she arrived at New York City on October 8, 1884 and was placed out of commission there on the 25th.

Following almost a year in ordinary, ''Brooklyn'' was recommissioned on October 15, 1885 and, on November 21, assigned once more to the South Atlantic Squadron and served in South American waters until heading home again on June 9, 1886.

=== Circumnavigating the globe  ===

At New York, she prepared for duty in the Orient and, on August 12, got underway for the Far East. After crossing the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, she transited the [[Suez Canal]] and traversed the [[Red Sea]] and the Indian Ocean to East Asian waters.

On April 4, 1887, Rear Admiral Chandler transferred his flag to her as commander of the [[Asiatic Squadron]], and she showed the flag in ports of the western Pacific Ocean until turning homeward for the last time on August 9, 1888. She returned to the United States via [[Honolulu]]; [[Cape Horn]]; and [[Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]]. ''Brooklyn'' completed her first [[circumnavigation]] of the earth upon her arrival at New York on April 24, 1889 and simultaneously ended her active naval career.

== Final decommissioning and sale ==

She was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on May 14, 1889, and her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] on January 6, 1890. She was sold by [[public auction]] at the Norfolk Navy Yard on March 25, 1891 to E. J. Butler.

'''Usuluk Bay Nature Park''' ({{lang-tr|Usuluk Koyu Tabiat Parkı}}) is a [[List of nature parks of Turkey|nature park]] at Usuluk Bay in [[Muğla Province]], southwestern Turkey.

Usuluk Bay is located on the highway [[Bodrum]]-[[Milas]] {{TUR-D|330}} at [[Torba, Bodrum|Torba]] village, northeast of Bodrum in Muğla Province.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sh1"/&gt; The area at Usuluk Bay coast was a popular picnic place for the Bodrum residents used free of charge in the past. In 2005, the area was leased to a private company for a lease term of 27 years with the purpose to run the place with entrance fee and payment for campers and caravan travelers. Since the related bylaws did not permit the use of the area with diversified purposes, the residents protested against the ruling of the [[Ministry of Forest and Water Management (Turkey)|Ministry of Forest and Water Management]]. In July 2011, the status of Usuluk Bay was changed from the "A-grade resort" to a [[nature park]] by the ministry.&lt;ref name="sh1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yg1"/&gt;

A '''volcanic hazard''' is the probability that a [[volcano|volcanic]] eruption or related geophysical event will occur in a given geographic area and within a specified window of time. The [[risk]] that can be associated with a volcanic hazard depends on the proximity and vulnerability of an asset or a population of people near to where a volcanic event might occur.

==Lava flows==
There are different forms of [[effusive eruption|effusive]] lava that can provide different [[hazard]]s. [[Pahoehoe]] lava is smooth and ropy while [[Aa (lava flow)|Aa]] lava is blocky and hard. Lava flows normally follow the topography, sinking into depressions and [[valley]]s and flowing down the volcano. Lava flows will bury roads [[farmland]]s and other forms of personal property.&lt;ref&gt;Kusky, 24&lt;/ref&gt; This lava could destroy homes, cars, and lives standing in the way.&lt;ref&gt;Rosi, 63&lt;/ref&gt; Lava flows are dangerous, however, they are slow moving and this gives people time to respond and evacuate out of immediate areas. People can mitigate this hazard by not moving to valleys or depressed areas around a volcano.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, et. al, 6693&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pyroclastic materials (tephra) and flow==
[[Tephra]] is a generalized word for the various bits of debris that are launched out of a volcano during an eruption, regardless of their size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/hazards/tephra/index.php USGS, Volcanic Hazards: Tephra, including volcanic ash]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pyroclastic]] materials are generally categorized according to size: dust measures at &lt;1/8&amp;nbsp;mm, ash is 1/8–2&amp;nbsp;mm, cinders are 2–64&amp;nbsp;mm, and [[Volcanic bomb|bombs]] and [[volcanic block|blocks]] are both &gt;64&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;Decker, 122&lt;/ref&gt; There are different hazards associated with the different kinds of pyroclastic materials. Dust and ash could coat cars and homes, rendering the car unable to drive with dust accumulation in the engine. They could also layer on homes and add weight to roofs causing the house to collapse. Also, ash and dust inhaled could cause long-term [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] issues in people inhaling the particles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregongeology.org/sub/earthquakes/volcanoes.htm ''Volcanic hazards,'' Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries]&lt;/ref&gt; Cinders are flaming pieces of ejected volcanic material which could set fire to homes and wooded areas. Bombs and blocks run the risk of hitting various objects and people within range of the volcano. Projectiles can be thrown thousands of feet in the air and can be found several miles away from the initial eruption point.&lt;ref&gt;Kusky, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[pyroclastic flow]] is a fast-moving (up to 700&amp;nbsp;km/hr) extremely hot (~1000&amp;nbsp;°C) mass of air and tephra that charges down the sides of a volcano during an [[explosive eruption]].

==Mudflows, floods, debris flows and avalanches==
When pyroclastic materials mix with water from a nearby [[stream]] or [[river]], they can turn the watercourse into a fast moving [[mudflow]]s. These are called [[lahar]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, et. al 48&lt;/ref&gt; when the lahar contains large material such as blocks of rock and trees, it is a volcanic [[debris flow]].&lt;ref&gt;Decker, 144&lt;/ref&gt; Lahars can form directly from a pyroclastic material flow flowing into a river, or could possibly form after the main eruption. The latter is referred to as secondary lahars and form when rain wets the ash and debris already on a landscape and stick together rolling along the topography. It's estimated that it can only take 30% water{{clarify|reason=content?|date=May 2011}} to initiate ash into a lahar.&lt;ref&gt;Kusky 30&lt;/ref&gt; The thicker and/or more fast-moving a lahar, the more potential to destroy things in its path, thus making it more dangerous than a slower and/or more diluted lahar. Lahars and mudflows can damage buildings, [[wildlife]] and cars and can prove difficult to escape once caught in them. The lahars can coat objects, wash objects away and can knock objects down by their force. Lahars, debris flows and mudflows that travel into a river or stream run the potential for crowding the waterway, forcing the water to flow outward and causing a flood. The volcanic matter could also pollute the water, making it unsafe to drink.

The debris that is ejected from the volcano adds to the sides of the slope with each eruption, making the sides steeper each time. Eventually the slope gets so steep that it fails and an avalanche ensues.&lt;ref&gt;Living With Volcanoes (USGS) 18&lt;/ref&gt; These avalanches carry material and debris for very long distances at very short intervals. This makes a warning system nearly immposible because the slope failure could occur at any time. The avalanche will destroy anything in its path including personal property, houses, buildings, vehicles and possibly even wildlife. If the impact of the materials in the avalanche doesn't destroy the person or object at first contact, there could be damage resulting from the weight of prolonged material on the objects.&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earthquakes related to volcanism==
[[Earthquake]]s can occur due to volcanic activity. These earthquakes could produce topographical deformation and/or destruction of buildings, homes, cars, etc. There are two different types of these earthquakes: [[volcano tectonic earthquake]]s and long period earthquakes. "Earthquakes produced by stress changes in solid rock due to the injection or withdrawal of magma (molton rock) are called volcano tectonic earthquakes".&lt;ref name="geo.mtu.edu"/&gt; These are hazardous due to the possibility of ground cracks or slope failures, therefore destroying everything in its path.&lt;ref name="geo.mtu.edu"&gt;[http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/hazards/primer/eq.html Volcanic Earthquakes]&lt;/ref&gt; Long period earthquakes, which happen when magma is suddenly forced into the surrounding rocks, are generally seen as a precursor to the actual eruption.&lt;ref name="geo.mtu.edu"/&gt;

==Monitoring and mitigation==
According to John Ewert and Ed Miller in a 1995 publication, "a great majority of the world's potentially active volcanoes are unmonitored". Of the historically active volcanoes in the world, less than one fourth are monitored. Only twenty-four volcanoes in the entire world are thoroughly monitored for activity. They also state that "seventy-five percent of the largest explosive eruptions since 1800 occurred at volcanoes that had no previous historical eruptions".&lt;ref name=VDAP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Vdap/description_vdap.html|title=The USGS/OFDA Volcano Disaster Assistance Program |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=March 21, 2001|accessdate=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By monitoring the seismic and geological activity, the USGS can warn people ahead of time about impending danger. These volcanologists measure the size of an eruption in two ways: the eruption magnitude (by the volume or mass of magma erupted) and eruption intensity (by the rate of magma erupted).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH2/Erickson/hazards.html Volcanic Hazards of Yellowstone National Park]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also various forms of satellites and imagery, such as satellite InSAR imagery, that monnitor the activity that isn't exposed to the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, et. al 55&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the situation has somewhat changed with the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction 
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/documents/ecosoc/res/1994/eres1994-31.htm  1994/31. International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Yokohama strategy since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the [[International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior]] [http://www.sveurop.org/gb/program/program.htm contribution] to the International decade&lt;/ref&gt;
The Global Assessment of Risk (GAR) report is a biennial review and analysis of natural hazards published by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR). The report implements the UN Hyogo Framework for Action. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalvolcanomodel.org/gvm-task-forces/gar15/ The Global Assessment of Risk (GAR) report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zadeh et al. (2014) provide an overview on Risks and Societal Implications of extreme natural hazards and an assessment of the global risk of volcanos and contains an appeal to found a worldwide volcanological organization comparable to the WMO 
.&lt;ref&gt;"Extreme Natural Hazards, Disaster Risks and Societal Implications, Zadeh et al Cambridge University Press, 17.04.2014". 
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:"New" wetland, Wallasea - Low tide - geograph.org.uk - 337283.jpg|thumb|Wallasea Wetlands relocated seawall in 2007, shortly after the initial stage of the scheme was finished]]
'''Wallasea Wetlands''' is a reclaimed [[wetland]]s area located in [[Essex]], [[England]]. It has been created as part of a government-funded wetlands scheme to halt the decline of wild and endangered birds caused by the drainage and development of former wetland sites. It is the largest man-made marine wetland area in the [[United Kingdom]].

The wetland spans an area of 115 [[hectare]]s and is sited on [[Wallasea Island]], which borders two rivers ([[River Crouch]] to the north and [[River Roach]] to the south-east). They provide winter grounds for wading birds, as well as breeding and nursery areas for aquatic wildlife, such as [[bass (fish)|bass]], [[mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[flatfish]] and [[herring]] and even some types of dolphin. The area will also help to reduce the flooding of properties near the River Crouch by providing a run-off area for floodwaters.

In the process being termed "managed re-alignment", the seawall that protects croplands and property was re-established in more tenable positions, three miles behind the new wetlands, which will provide habitat for birds like [[oystercatcher]]s, [[avocet]]s and [[Little Tern|little terns]], according to the press release issued at the time.

Walkers and birdwatchers will be able to enjoy the scenery by means of a new footpath that has been built on the top of this new relocated sea wall. Construction was completed in 2006 and by 2011 the land had evolved into wetland, [[mudflat]]s, saline [[lagoon]]s and seven artificial islands, allowing the wildlife to reside on these areas.

An extension to the scheme, using 2,400 shiploads of spoil excavated from London's [[Crossrail]] tunnels, was completed in July 2015, when an additional area of land was opened to tidal flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Caroline|title=Wallasea Island project takes significant step forward as sea wallsn breached|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/13/wallasea-island-project-takes-significant-step-forward-as-sea-walls-breached|accessdate=13 July 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole project is expected to be completed by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bomford|first1=Andrew|title=Crossrail's excavated earth used to make nature reserve|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-32879846|accessdate=26 May 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wallasea Island Wild Coast project|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/w/wallaseaisland/about.aspx|publisher=[[RSPB]]|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Wetlands have existed on Wallasea Island since ancient times, when much of the Essex coastline was bordered by rich breeding grounds for birds. In the 15th century these lands were drained by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settlers for agricultural use with the construction of the original sea wall. Over time more wetland areas were drained for development, leading to the reduction and endangerment of the wildlife that depended on it.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s two areas of [[salt marsh]] and [[mud flat]] at Lappel Bank in the [[Medway Estuary]] in [[Kent]] and Fagbury Flats in the [[Orwell Estuary]] in [[Suffolk]] (both on the east coast of England) were drained and port developments at [[Sheerness]] and [[Port of Felixstowe|Felixstowe]] were built in their place. The [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that under the European [[Birds Directive]] these wetlands had to be replaced, and it was decided that new wetlands should be created. The following criteria for Wallasea Wetlands has been met in accordance with this ruling:

* they will complement and uphold existing coastal strategies and not impact on other local environmentally sensitive sites
* they will create an attractive, sustainable site for the bird population that has been displaced over a 50 - 70-year period
* they will provide additional flood and storm protection for the area
* they will create an attractive environment for local people that would not impact negatively on existing business or leisure activities

In 2005, the £7.5million project to return the island to its original [[salt marsh]] was commenced, beginning with the construction of the new sea defence wall, defining the area where the tides were permitted to flood. Work was completed on 4 July 2006, when 300m of the original sea wall were bulldozed, allowing sea tides to flood the area at high tide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14817">The '''World3''' [[model (abstract)|model]] is a [[system dynamics]] model for [[computer simulation]] of interactions between population, industrial growth, food production and limits in the [[ecosystem]]s of the earth. It was originally produced and used by a [[Club of Rome]] study that produced the model and the book ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' (1972). The creators of the model were [[Dennis Meadows]], project manager, and a team of 16 researchers.&lt;ref name="Meadows-1972"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadows|first1=Donella H|last2=Meadows|first2=Dennis L|last3=Randers|first3=Jørgen|last4=Behrens III|first4=William W|title=The Limits to Growth; A Report for the Club of Rome's Project on the Predicament of Mankind|date=1972|publisher=Universe Books|location=New York|isbn=0876631650|url=http://www.donellameadows.org/wp-content/userfiles/Limits-to-Growth-digital-scan-version.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|8}}  

The model was documented in the book ''Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World''. It added new features to [[Jay W. Forrester]]'s World2 model. Since World3 was originally created, it has had minor tweaks to get to the World3/91 model used in the book ''[[Beyond the Limits]]'', later improved to get the World3/2000 model distributed by the [[Institute for Policy and Social Science Research]] and finally the World3/2004 model used in the book ''Limits to Growth: the 30 year update''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meadows|first1=Donella|last2=Randers|first2=Jorgen|last3=Meadows|first3=Dennis|title=A Synopsis: Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update|url=http://donellameadows.org/archives/a-synopsis-limits-to-growth-the-30-year-update/|website=Donella Meadows Project|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World3 is one of several global models that have been generated throughout the world (Mesarovic/Pestel Model, Bariloche Model, MOIRA Model, SARU Model, FUGI Model) and is probably the model that generated the spark for all later models.

== Model ==
The model consisted of several interacting parts.  Each of these dealt with a different system of the model.  The main systems were 
*the food system, dealing with agriculture and food production
*the industrial system
*the population system
*the non-renewable resources system
*the pollution system

=== Agricultural system ===
The simplest useful view of this system is that land and [[fertilizer]] are used for [[farm]]ing, and more of either will produce more food. In the context of the model, since land is finite, and industrial output required to produce fertilizer and other [[agricultural]] inputs can not keep up with demand, there necessarily will be a food collapse at some point in the future.

=== Nonrenewable resources system ===
{{main|World3 nonrenewable resource sector}}

The nonrenewable resource system starts with the assumption that the total amount of resources available is finite (about 110 times the consumption at 1990s rates for the World3/91 model). These resources can be extracted and then used for various purposes in other systems in the model. An important assumption that was made is that as the nonrenewable resources are extracted, the remaining resources are increasingly difficult to extract, thus diverting more and more industrial output to resource extraction.

=== Reference run predictions ===
The ''Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World'' provides several different scenarios. The "reference run" is the one that "represent the most likely behavior mode of the system if the process of industrialization in the future proceeds in a way very similar to its progress in the past, and if technologies and value changes that have already been institutionalized continue to evolve."&lt;ref name="Meadows et al.-1974"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadows|first1=Dennis L., et al.|title=Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World|date=1974|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0262131420|url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Dynamics-Growth-Finite-World-Dennis-L-Meadows/9780262131421|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|502}} In this scenario, in 2000, the world population reaches six billion, and then goes on to peak at seven billion in 2030. After that population declines because of an increased death rate. In 2015, both industrial output per capita and food per capita peak at US$375 per person (1970s dollars) and 500 vegetable-equivalent kilograms/person. Persistent pollution peaks in the year 2035 at 11 times 1970s levels.&lt;ref name="Meadows et al.-1974"/&gt;{{RP|500}}

== Criticism of the model ==
There has been quite a bit of criticism of the World3 model. Some has come from the model creators themselves, some has come from economists and some has come from other places.

One of the major criticisms of the model is that it simply has not reflected the reality of the world since the 1970s when the model was first published.{{fact|date=January 2011}} At least one study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.05.001 | title = A comparison of the Limits to Growth with 30 years of reality | year = 2008 | last1 = Turner | first1 = G. | journal = Global Environmental Change | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 397–411  }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, claims that "30 years of historical data compare favorably with key features of a business-as-usual scenario called the 'standard run' scenario" produced by the World3 model.

In the book ''Groping in the Dark: The First Decade of Global Modelling'',&lt;ref name="Meadows-1982"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadows|first1=Donella H.|title=Groping in the dark: the first decade of global modelling| date=1982| publisher=Wiley| location=New York|isbn=0471100277|url=https://books.google.co.th/books/about/Groping_in_the_dark.html?id=QPaQAAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|129}} [[Donella Meadows]] states: &lt;blockquote&gt;We have great confidence in the basic qualitative assumptions and conclusions about the instability of the current global socioeconomic system and the general kinds of changes that will and will not lead to stability. We have relatively great confidence in the feedback-loop structure of the model, with some exceptions which I list below.  We have a mixed degree of confidence in the numerical parameters of the model; some are well-known physical or biological constants that are unlikely to change, some are statistically derived social indices quite likely to change, and some are pure guesses that are perhaps only of the right order of magnitude. The structural assumptions in World3 that I consider most dubious and also sensitive enough to be of concern are:

*the constant capital-output ratio (which assumes no diminishing returns to capital)
*the residual nature of the investment function
*the generally ineffective labour contribution to output&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A detailed criticism of the model is in the book ''Models of Doom: A Critique of the Limits to Growth''.&lt;ref name="Cole-1973"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=H. S. D.|last2=Freeman|first2=Christopher|title=Models of Doom: A Critique of the Limits to Growth|date=1973|publisher=Vhps Rizzoli|isbn=0876639058|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Models-Doom-Critique-Limits-Growth/dp/0876639058|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|905-908}}

Both [[Julian Lincoln Simon]] and [[Bjørn Lomborg]] have discussed the assumptions that the model makes. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The first assumption that they criticize is the assumption of finite natural resources.  They also state that the limits on agriculture are invalid since they are based on the limit of the amount of land.

[[Vaclav Smil]] disagreed with the combination of physically different processes into simplified equations:
 
:But those of us who knew the [[DYNAMO (programming language)|DYNAMO]] language in which the simulation was written and those who took the model apart line-by-line quickly realized that we had to deal with an exercise in misinformation and obfustication rather than with a model delivering valuable insights.  I was particularly astonished by the variables labelled ''Nonrenewable Resources'' and ''Pollution''. Lumping together (to cite just a few scores of possible examples) highly substitutable but relatively limited resources of liquid oil with unsubstitutable but immense deposits of sedimentary phosphate rocks, or short-lived atmospheric gases with long-lived radioactive wastes, struck me as extraordinarily meaningless.&lt;ref name="Smil-2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smil|first1=Vaclav|title=Energy at the Crossroads; Global Perspectives and Uncertainties|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780262693240|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/energy-crossroads|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|168}}

He does however consider continuous growth in world GDP a problem:

:Only the widespread scientific illiteracy and innumeracy—all you need to know in this case is how to execute the equation &lt;math&gt;y = x * e^{rt}&lt;/math&gt;—prevents most of the people from dismissing the idea of sustainable growth at healthy rates as an oxymoronic stupidity whose pursuit is, unfortunately, infinitely more tragic than comic. After all, even cancerous cells stop growing once they have destroyed the invaded tissues.&lt;ref name="Smil-2005"/&gt;{{RP|338-339}}

Others have put forth criticisms, such as Henshaw, King, and Zarnikau who in a 2011 paper, ''Systems Energy Assessment''&lt;ref&gt; Henshaw, King, Zarnikau, 2011 ''Systems Energy Assessment''. ''Sustainability'', 3(10), 1908-1943; doi:10.3390/su3101908 &lt;/ref&gt; point out that the methodology of such models may be valid empirically as a world model, but might not then also be useful for decision making. The impact data being used is generally collected according to where the impacts are recorded as occurring, following standard I/O material processes accounting methods. It is not reorganized according to who pays for or profits from the impacts, so who is actually responsible for economic impacts is never determined.  

*The economic motives causing the impacts, that might also control them, would then not be reflected in the model.
*As a seeming technicality, it could bring into question the use of many kinds of economic models for sustainability decision-making.

The authors of the book ''Surviving 1,000 Centuries'' consider some of the predictions too pessimistic, but some of the overall message correct.&lt;ref name="Bonnet-2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonnet|first1=Roger-Maurice|last2=Woltjer|first2=Lodewijk|title=Surviving 1,000 Centuries; Can we do it?|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9780387746333|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=83zhYT7kvgkC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;lpg=PA314&amp;dq=Surviving+1,000+Centuries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uzkCQRyzL3&amp;sig=TaIRlN9ABnqTfp4UhBYGB5yatPk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjt8q-sOHXAhUDLo8KHQ3hAJIQ6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Surviving%201%2C000%20Centuries&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|4-5}}&lt;blockquote&gt;...[We] come to the well-known study, ''Limits to Growth'', published under the sponsorship of the 'Club de Rome' - an influential body of private individuals.  A first attempt was made to make a complete systems analysis of the rapidly growing human-biological-resource-pollution system.  In this  analysis the manifold interactions between the different parts were explicitly taken into account.  The conclusion was that disaster was waiting around the corner in a few decades because of resource exhaustion, pollution and other factors.  Now, 35 years later, our world still exists, ... So the 'growth lobby' has laughed and proclaimed that ''Limits to Growth'' and, by extension, the environmental movements may be forgotten.  This entirely misses the point.  Certainly the timescale of the problems was underestimated in ''Limits to Growth'', giving us a little more time than we thought.  Moreover, during the last three decades a variety of national or collaborative international measures have been taken that have forced reductions in pollution, as we shall discuss.  A shining example of this is the Montreal Protocol (1987) that limited the industrial production of fluorocarbons that damage the ozone layer and generated the 'ozone hole' over Antarctica. The publication of ''Limits to Growth'' has greatly contributed towards creating the general willingness of governments to consider such issues.  Technological developments have also lead to improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and other resources, but, most importantly, the warnings from Malthus onward have finally had their effect as may be seen from the population-limiting policies followed by China and, more hesitantly, by India.  Without such policies all other efforts would be in vain.  However, the basic message of ''Limits to Growth'', that exponential growth of our world civilization cannot continue very long and that a very careful management of the planet is needed, remain as valid as ever.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
