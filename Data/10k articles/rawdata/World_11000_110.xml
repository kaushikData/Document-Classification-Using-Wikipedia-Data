Soemarno, Ongki P. Soemarno and join at dormant period Sugiono Wiyono. It started its nationwide broadcast in the beginning of August 2008 with an initial 10 channels, highlighting the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. Four of the channels were dedicated to Olympic coverage. Aora earned the exclusive broadcasting rights to the 2008 Olympics exclusively for Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kontan.co.id/index.php/Nasional/news/681/Aora_TV_Menyemarakkan_Pasar_Teve_Berbayar Aora TV Menyemarakkan Pasar Teve Berbayar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830060549/http://www.kontan.co.id/index.php/Nasional/news/681/Aora_TV_Menyemarakkan_Pasar_Teve_Berbayar |date=August 30, 2008 }}, ''Kontan Online'', August 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Still in August 2008, Aora TV won the sole rights in Indonesia to broadcast the [[2008–09 Premier League|2008&amp;ndash;09 season]] of the [[Premier League]] and offered a new, 12-channel package service which included [[ESPN]] and [[STAR Sports]], which contains the Premier League content. This allows Aora subscribers to watch, in full, the 370 Premier League matches of the 2008/09 season, including preview shows and weekly highlights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detiksport.com/sepakbola/read/2008/08/18/182313/990460/72/liga-inggris-resmi-di-aora-tv Liga Inggris Resmi di Aora TV], ''detiksport'', August 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Premier League broadcast rights were then expired just few hours before the start of the 2009/2010 season, that forced Aora to replace both channels with [[GOALTV|Goal TV 1]] and [[GOALTV|Goal TV 2]] effective on August 15, 2009. At the same time, Aora also added several new channels into its channels lineup. Due to no exclusive Premier League matches again, Aora TV loss a lot of the subscribers and at end of 2009 Aora TV discontinued all of the broadcast followed by curtailment of 90 percent of the employees. In January 2010 Aora TV re-broadcast, but not as Premium/Exclusive Pay TV as before. At the current Aora TV try as medium to low income market with the lowest subscription fee Rp.59,000 (around $7) per month.

Fees are only for decoder rental which goes for Rp.99,000. (approximately US$11) per month.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

{{Infobox Bilateral relations|Colombia–Russia|Colombia|Russia}}

'''Colombia–Russia relations''' refers to the [[bilateralism|bilateral]] and [[diplomacy|foreign relations]] between [[Colombia]] and [[Russia]]. Diplomatic relations between Colombia and the [[USSR]] were established for the first time on June 25, 1935 (then severed on May 3, 1948, and restored back to normal on January 19, 1968). Colombia has an embassy in Moscow and Russia has an embassy in Bogotá.

==Today==
[[Image:Embassy of Columbia in Moscow, building.jpg|left|thumb|Colombian embassy in [[Moscow]]]]
On October 3, 2008, Colombia, considered one of the closest U.S. allies in Latin America, sent its defense minister to Russia for the first time to discuss signing a new military cooperation accord. Defense minister (and future president) [[Juan Manuel Santos]] arrived in Russia on Oct. 6 to attend an [[Interpol]] police conference and meet with his Russian counterpart [[Anatoly Serdyukov]], along with Colombia's Ambassador to Russia, Diego José Tobón Echeverri.

Alquin "is the first Colombian defense minister to make an official visit to Russia, which is of major significance for relations between the two countries", the Colombian presidency said on its web site. Talks focused on cooperation in fighting the drugs trade, terrorism and a new defense accord, it said.

Colombian Vice-President Francisco Santos said during a visit to Russia in June that his country wants to buy fighter and transport helicopters and radar systems as it broadens its sources of defense equipment. The defense minister will attend a demonstration of Russian weaponry during his week-long visit, the presidency in Bogota said.
Colombia's efforts to court Russia came after it voiced concerns about billions of dollars in Russian arms sales to neighboring Venezuela, where President Hugo Chávez proclaimed a goal of countering U.S. influence in Latin America and was accused by Colombia of arming FARC rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid%3D20601087%26sid%3DatrTYtEVGzbw |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922213049/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087 |archivedate=2008-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2013, the [[Colombian Air Force]] intercepted two [[Tu-160]]s of the Russian Air Force that were flying over Colombian [[airspace]] without previous governmental clearance. The two blackjacks, as code named by the [[NATO]], were escorted out of Colombian airspace soon after and a note of protest was sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Colombia to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/colombia-russian-bombers-violated-air-space-20797047 |title=International News &amp;#124; World News |website=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9768">The '''flying geese paradigm''' ('''FGP''') is a view of Japanese scholars upon the technological development in [[Southeast Asia]] viewing [[Japan]] as a leading power. It was developed in the 1930s, but gained wider popularity in the 1960s after its author [[Kaname Akamatsu]] published his ideas in the ''[[Journal of Developing Economies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tausch, Arno, The Hallmarks of Crisis: A New Center-Periphery Perspective on Long Cycles (July 16, 2013). {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.2294324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Akamatsu’s third flying geese paradigm==

[[image:V-formation.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Geese]] in [[V formation]]]]
Akamatsu’s third flying geese paradigm (FGP) is a model for international division of labor in East Asia based on dynamic [[comparative advantage]]. The paradigm postulated that Asian nations will catch up with the West as a part of a regional hierarchy where the production of [[Commodification|commoditized]] goods would continuously move from the more advanced countries to the less advanced ones. The underdeveloped nations in the region could be considered to be "aligned successively behind the advanced industrial nations in the order of their different stages of growth in a wild-geese-flying pattern."&lt;ref&gt;Ozawa, T. (2005), 9&lt;/ref&gt; The lead goose in this pattern is Japan itself, the second-tier of nations consisted of the [[Newly industrialized country|newly industrializing economies]] (South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong). After these two groups come the main [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] countries: Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Finally the least developed major nations in the region: China, Vietnam, the Philippines, etc. make up the rear guard in the formation.&lt;ref&gt;Kasahara S. (2004), 2–13&lt;/ref&gt;

The main driver in the model is the "leader's imperative for internal restructuring"&lt;ref&gt;Kasahara S. (2004), 10&lt;/ref&gt; due to increasing labor costs. As the comparative advantages (on a global scale) of the "lead goose" causes it to shift further and further away from labor-intensive production to more capital-intensive activities it sheds its low-productivity production to nations further down in the hierarchy in a pattern that then reproduces itself between the countries in the lower tiers. The impulse for development always comes from the top tier causing many to label the FGP a top-down model.&lt;ref&gt;Kasahara S. (2004), 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; The FGP has proved to be a useful tool when describing the regional production patterns in East Asia as industries such as the textile industry has left not only Japan – the most advanced East Asian nation – but also, at a later point, South Korea, and Taiwan etc. These second tier nations have now firmly established themselves in for instance the automotive industry and advanced production of [[consumer electronics]] and the like.

The vehicle for [[technology transfer]] is where Akamatsu’s framework is least developed. He does however suggest that the demonstration effect of international trade plays an important part as well as the "animal spirit of the entrepreneurs" in developing countries. More recently, modified versions of the FGP – such as the one presented in Ozawa (1995) – stress the importance of transnational firms in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Kasahara S. (2004), 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the internal order of nations within the model, Akamatsu did not consider the relative positions to be permanently fixed but could rather be seen as inherently unstable. This idea is most likely connected to the memories of the Japanese development in the late 19th century when it catapulted itself from a technological backwater to a mature industrial powerhouse.  Other scholars, however, have emphasized the stability and harmony of the clustered growth envisaged in the FGP implying it would be difficult for a nation to shift from one tier to another.&lt;ref&gt;Kasahara S. (2004), 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

==The relevance of Akamatsu's paradigm==

As has been shown recently,&lt;ref&gt;Tausch, Arno, The Hallmarks of Crisis: A New Center-Periphery Perspective on Long Cycles (July 16, 2013). {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.2294324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akamatsu's theory emphasizes the differentiation of the world economy, which leads to the rapid diffusion of new techniques to rising industrial nations, which starts with the import of new commodities by these nations. In time, techniques and capital goods are imported as well, and homogenous industries are being established. The uniformization of both industry and agriculture gave rise to the fierce and conflictive competition between Europe, the United States and Japan in the last quarter of the 19th Century. When an innovation occurs in some industry in an advanced nation, investment is concentrated there, causing a rise in the trade cycle. Innovation leads to an increase in exports, and the nation’s prosperity creates and increases the import of raw materials and foodstuffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/911206248|title=Great divergence and great convergence : a global perspective|last=V.,|first=Korotaev, A.|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319363660|oclc=911206248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akamatsu sees a counter-movement in other parts of the world, centered on the rising production of gold, which, according to him, leads to an increase in effective demand and further stimulates exports of the innovating nation. In that way, world production and trade expand, prices increase and a worldwide rise in the long-term trade cycle results.

However, innovations spread from the innovating nations to other nations, leading to the development of industries in those countries, with the result of a conflictive relationship with the industries of the innovating nation. Exports of the innovating nation become stagnant, and on the world level, there is a tendency towards [[overproduction]], prices turn downwards, and the rates of growth of production and trade fall. The first, rising [[A-phase]] of the [[Kondratiev cycle]] will be according to Akamatsu a period of differentiation in the world economic structure, while the “falling period” or [[B-phase]] of the [[Kondratiev cycle]] will, Akamatsu argues, coincide with a process of uniformization in world economic structure.

For Akamatsu, the characteristic structure of the Center-Periphery relationship is characterized by the fact that the underdeveloped nation will export primary products and will import industrial goods for consumption. Later on, an underdeveloped nation will attempt to produce goods which were hitherto imported, first in the field of consumer goods, and later on in the area of capital goods. As the fourth stage of the process, the underdeveloped nation will attempt to export capital goods. There will be a tendency of “advanced” differentiation in the world economy, however, because the capital goods industries in advanced nations will still advance further, giving rise to “extreme differences of comparative costs”. The wild-geese flying pattern will include three sub-patterns: the first is the sequence of imports – domestic production – exports. The second will be the sequence from consumer goods to capital goods and from crude and simple articles to complex and refined articles. The third will be the alignment from the advanced nations to backward nations according to their stages of growth.

However, there is a darker and more somber nature of these cycles as well – the condition of discrepancy will be met, Akamatsu argues, by means of imports, leading to discrepancies in the balance of payments, and the pressure to increase exports of primary products to improve the balance. Discrepancies will also lead to a shift of production away from domestic industries in the underdeveloped country towards the export sector; leading, in the end, also to problems of excessive supply capacities in the underdeveloped country etc.

At the end of the day, Akamatsu believes in a Hegelian dialectic between the three basic discrepancies, characterizing the process of development: the discrepancy of development, the cyclical discrepancy between the rich and the poor countries, and the structural discrepancy.

The '''Guinean Democratic Movement''' ({{lang-pt|Movimento Democrático Guineense}}) is a [[political party]] in [[Guinea-Bissau]].

==History==
The party was established on 14 February 2003 and was led by [[Silvestre Alves]].&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan Szajkowski (2005) ''Political Parties of the World'', p272&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2004|2004 parliamentary elections]] it received 0.98% of the vote, failing to win a seat in the [[National People's Assembly (Guinea-Bissau)|National People's Assembly]]. The [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2008|2008 elections]] saw the party's vote share fall to just 0.14%, again failing to win a seat.&lt;ref name=HD&gt;Peter Karibe Mendy (2013) ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau'', Scarecrow Press, p278&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alves openly condemned the increasingly repressive actions of the Military Command following the [[2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'état|2012 military coup]], and in October 2012 was arrested and severely beaten, requiring intensive care in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Mendy, p279&lt;/ref&gt; The party's application to contest the [[Guinea-Bissau general election, 2014|2014 general elections]] was rejected by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anacao.cv/online/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4420:guine-bissau-supremo-chumba-oito-candidaturas-presidenciais-e-sete-partidos&amp;catid=87:destaque&amp;Itemid=475 GUINÉ-BISSAU: SUPREMO “CHUMBA” OITO CANDIDATURAS PRESIDENCIAIS E SETE PARTIDOS] A Nação, 16 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMS ''Scimitar''''' is a {{sclass-|Scimitar|patrol vessel|0}} [[patrol boat|fast patrol boat]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]]. She is a Lifespan Patrol Vessel type boat and formerly served in inland waterway duties in [[Northern Ireland]] as MV ''Grey Fox''. She was acquired to serve with the [[Gibraltar Squadron]], tasked with policing, customs and [[search and rescue]] duties. This released an {{sclass-|Archer|patrol vessel|0}} patrol vessel for tasking with the [[Cyprus Squadron]].

==Operational history==
''Scimitar'' was involved in a diplomatic incident between the United Kingdom and Spain in November 2009 after being alleged by the Spanish to have been using the Spanish flag as a target during gunnery practice. The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] stated that the ship had actually been shooting at a [[NATO]] maritime signal flag, which is similar in appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8371305.stm |title=UK 'sorry' for shooting at 'Spanish flag' buoy.|accessdate=2009-12-31|date=November 2009|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May 2011 ''Scimitar'' was dispatched to intercept the Spanish {{sclass-|Serviola|patrol boat|0}} patrol boat {{ship|Spanish patrol boat|Atalaya|P74|2}} when she entered British waters (claimed by Spanish) around Gibraltar and ordered the Spanish ship to leave the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defensenews.com/story.php?i=6403538&amp;c=SEA&amp;s=EUR|title=Gibraltar Slams New 'Incursion' By Spanish Navy.|accessdate=2011-05-10|date=May 2011|publisher=Defence News}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scimitar'' took part in another encounter with a Spanish naval vessel on 4 April 2017. It challenged ''Infanta Cristina,'' a {{sclass-|Descubierta|corvette}} that had entered British waters (claimed by Spanish) off of Gibraltar. ''Infanta Cristina'' left without further incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/04/new-spanish-patrol-boat-incursion-gibraltars-waters/?WT.mc_id=tmgoff_fb_tmg|title=Royal Navy chases Spanish patrol boat out of waters off Gibraltar as Nigel Farage says UK must not be 'bullied'.|accessdate=2017-04-04|date=April 2017|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2017, HMS ''Scimitar'' intercepted the Spanish corvette ''Infanta Elena'' trying to enter British territorial waters off Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/spanish-warship-forced-away-gibraltar-patrol-boat-hms-scimitar |title=Spanish warship forced away from Gibraltar by patrol boat HMS Scimitar.|accessdate=2017-08-11|date=November 2017|publisher=UK Defence Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replacement==
In July 2017 it was revealed that the Gibraltar Squadron would receive two new warships which will be more “capable”, “faster” and have “bigger guns”, to replace ''Sabre'' and ''Scimitar'' "within the next two years".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gbc.gi/news/gibraltar-squadron-receive-two-new-warships&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, he served as president ([[Rector (academia)|rector]]) of the [[University of Mannheim]] between 1985 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschichte.uni-mannheim.de/abteilungen/alte_geschichte/personen/ehemalige/heinrich_chantraine/index.html |title=Prof. Dr. Heinrich Chantraine |publisher=University of Mannheim |accessdate=2014-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119110005/http://www.geschichte.uni-mannheim.de/abteilungen/alte_geschichte/personen/ehemalige/heinrich_chantraine/index.html |archivedate=2009-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Chantraine obtained his PhD in [[history]] at the [[University of Mainz]] in 1952. His [[dissertation]] was supervised by Hans Ulrich Instinsky and dealt with the examination of the Roman history at the end of the 2nd century AD. Previously, he had obtained a master's degree in history and [[classical philology]] at the University of Mainz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-mannheim.de/pressestelle.archiv/pressemitteilungen/2002/2002_04/2002_pm_75.html|title=University of Mannheim - Press: Heinrich Chantraine (20.12.2002)|publisher=University of Mannheim|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
After having completed his PhD, Chantraine worked from 1957 to 1958 on projects, supervised by Konrad Kraft, that were dealing with ancient Roman coins found in Germany and afterwards served as research associate at the [[University of Mainz]]. In 1965, Chantraine finished his [[habilitation]] with his work on "Slavery and Release in service for the Roman Emperor" (''Freigelassene und Sklaven im Dienst der römischen Kaiser''). Two years later he became chaired professor at the history department of the [[University of Mannheim]] (UMA). Between 1970 and 1970 he served as vice president of the university and from 1986 to 1988 president of the UMA. In 1995 Chantraine retired.

During his active time as professor he published a large number of diverse publications. Since 1988, he was a full member of the ''[[Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur|Mainzer Akademie der Wissenschaften]]'' (Academy of Sciences in Mainz) and member of supervisory board of the [http://www.ekkehardstiftung.de/ Ekkehardstiftung].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/B%C3%BCcher/s?ie=UTF8&amp;field-author=Heinrich%20Chantraine&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A186606%2Cp_27%3AHeinrich%20Chantraine|title=List of published books of Chantraine|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Karamogo''' were the scholar class among the peaceful [[Dyula people|Dyula]] [[merchant|traders]] of [[Western Africa]], of which [[Al-Hajj Salim Suwari]] was a prominent member. The Karamogo developed theological rationales for living among non-[[Muslim]]s, arguing that one should nurture one's own faith and let conversion happen in its own time. Accordingly, [[jihad]] should not be waged except in defensive contexts.

==Early life and education==
Laurens-Jan Brinkhorst was born in the city of [[Zwolle]]. After getting his high school diploma (''gymnasium-B-diploma'' in Dutch) he studied law at the [[University of Leiden]] (''Rijksuniversiteit Leiden'' in Dutch), where he obtained his [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]] degree in 1959. He received also an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in Public Law and Government from [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. Afterwards he worked at [[Shearman &amp; Sterling]] in [[New York City]].

==Personal life==
On 26 August 1960, Brinkhorst married Jantien Heringa (born 2 February 1935 in [[Voorburg]]), daughter of Ewardus Heringa ([[Den Haag]], 14 November 1904 - [[Den Haag]], 30 November 1988) and wife (m. [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], 4 August 1930) Petronela Johanna Roskam ([[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], 20 August 1905 - [[Den Haag]], 19 December 1991). Brinkhorst and Heringa are the parents of Marius Brinkhorst (born 9 February 1964) and the Dutch princess [[Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands|Laurentien Brinkhorst]] (born 25 May 1966), who married [[Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands|Prince Constantijn]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geneall.net/W/per_page.php?id=131916 Geneall]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in politics and academia==
From 1962, and from 1965 as a director, he worked at the Europe-institute at the [[university of Leiden|Rijksuniversiteit Leiden]] where he became a Reader (Lector) in 1965 as well. During the period 1967-1973 he was Professor of European Law at the University of Groningen ([[Rijksuniversiteit Groningen]] in Dutch).

In 1977 he was again a member of the Second Chamber of the Dutch parliament for D66 and in 1981 became the leader of his party in parliament.  From 1983-1987 he was Ambassador of the European Community in [[Japan]]. In 1987 he became a correspondent of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://knaw.nl/en/members/correspondents/3948 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904200752/http://knaw.nl/en/members/correspondents/3948 |title=Laurens Jan Brinkhorst |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |archive-date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1987 and 1994 Brinkhorst continued his service at the European Commission as Director-General for Environmental Affairs and Nuclear Safety. In 1994 Brinkhorst became a member of the [[European Parliament]], serving there until 1999.

Brinkhorst was also a member of the ''Provinciale Staten'' (the provincial parliament) of the province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] for D66, a member of the board of advice of the World Resources Institute in [[Washington DC]], a member of the board of governors of the ''Nederlands Economisch Instituut'' (Dutch Economical Institute), a professor by special appointment of international environmental law at the University of Leiden, a member of the Board of Directors of the Salzburg Seminar, a member of the Board of Directors of the International Institute of Sustainable Development, and a professor (on a temporary basis) of international [[environmental law]] at the University of [[Lausanne]].

The '''M-1''' (or '''M-59''') was a standard issue [[gas mask]] for troops in [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslavia]], as well as for SFRY successor states ([[Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Croatian military|Croatia]], [[Army of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Military of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Slovenian Armed Forces|Slovenia]], [[Serbian Armed Forces|Serbia]]). It is a copy of the U.S. M-9 gas mask. It was also used by the Iraqi army in the [[Gulf War]], where it was designated ''M-59''. It is OD green in color, and has a side-loading canister which uses a 60mm opening. The M-1 is not very common in the United States, as few were imported as surplus. There are different versions of the mask, MC-1 (civilian version), M-1 (civilian version but with oral nasal cup, and some things in the bag are different) and the M-59 (the military version). The filter doesn't have asbestos, but may contain chromium.

'''RTÉ Ireland''' (lit. Raidió Teilifís Éireann Ireland = Radio Television Ireland Ireland) is the planned international television channel by [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland's]] public service broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] (RTÉ).&lt;ref name="Strategy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.rasset.ie/documents/news/rtestrategicplan-shortversion.pdf |title=Strategy 2012-2017 |publisher=RTÉ |date=2013-09-16 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel will broadcast online at [[RTÉ.ie]], [[IPTV]] and on satellite in the United Kingdom.

The channel is expected to offer programmes from [[RTÉ One]] and [[RTÉ Two|Two]], including education, drama, comedy, music, news and current affairs. This includes ''[[The All Ireland Talent Show]]'', ''[[Fair City]]'', ''[[Dragons' Den]]'' and ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]''. The [[Oireachtas]] (parliament) has passed legislation requiring that RTÉ supply international service to suit the needs of Irish citizens living abroad, along with other new digital RTÉ channels.

==History==

The channel was initially to launch in Spring 2009 under the branding RTÉ International. The channel was expected to launch in the [[United Kingdom]] in March 2009. (RTÉ's domestic channels are already available on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] and [[Virgin Media]] in [[Northern Ireland]], but not to [[Great Britain]], owing to rights restrictions.) There are also plans to launch the channel in North America and [[Central Europe]].

A similar service aired from 1996 until 2002 operated by a now-defunct cable and satellite channel, [[Tara Television]]. This channel was carried on [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] in the United Kingdom and on a small number of cable television services. The channel was 75% owned by [[Liberty Global|UPC]], RTÉ owned the remaining 25%. It was claimed by RTÉ that the channel could not pay royalty payments due to RTÉ for their programming. Despite a last minute deal between [[Setanta Sports]] and [[Liberty Global|UPC]], Tara closed down, leaving Irish viewers in Britain without access to Irish television. Setanta then considered themselves creating a direct replacement channel carrying the best of RTÉ TV in Britain during 2004, but this did not materialise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2002/03/24/story5152728.asp]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] councillor, of Irish extraction, Martin Curry, is seeking to have RTÉ International carried on the digital terrestrial television service, [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], if Sky removes its channels from Freeview, rather than allowing Sky to use the bandwidth for subscription television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oatts |first=Joanne |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a42678/sky-warns-cable-viewers-channels-may-go.html |title=Sky warns cable viewers channels may go |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is unlikely to happen as limited capacity on Freeview generally prevents the broadcasting of minority channels during main daytime/peak time hours.{{cn|date=January 2014}}

On 17 March 2008, [[Eamon Ryan]] the [[Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources|Minister for Communications]] announced the launch of RTÉ International under the new working title of Diaspora TV. On 4 June 2008 [[The Irish Post]] reported that the channel would not in fact be named Diaspora TV and would keep the RTÉ International name, they also added that the channel may be operational ahead of the previously scheduled launch date of 17 March 2009.&lt;ref name="RTÉ International040608"&gt;

|archivedate=2008-06-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 November 2008, RTÉ postponed the planned launch, citing straitened financial circumstances. The broadcaster wrote to Eamon Ryan during October claiming that it would be “unwise” for it to continue with the plan. RTÉ said it intended to honour the commitment in the [[Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007|2007 Broadcasting Act]] and hoped to launch the station by the end of 2009. A spokeswoman for Eamon Ryan said the decision to postpone the launch of the channel was "a reflection of the financial realities in Ireland and worldwide". She said the minister is committed to the idea of RTÉ International and that it could be a "brilliant product" similar to [[BBC World News]].&lt;ref name="RTÉ international shelved"&gt;

The '''Romano-Serbian language''' is a [[mixed language]] (referred to as a [[Para-Romani]] variety in Romani linguistics) resulting from [[language contact]] between [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Romani language|Romani]] in [[Serbia]] and [[Former Yugoslavia|former Yugoslav countries]] and distinct from the [[Vlax Romani language|Vlax Romani]] dialects spoken in Serbia.

==Publications==
In October 2005 the first text on the grammar of the [[Romani language|Romani proper]] in Serbia was published by linguist [[Rajko Đurić]], titled ''Gramatika e Rromane čhibaki - Граматика ромског језика (Gramatika romskog jezika)''.

Commercial '''[[whaling]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]]''' began late in the 16th century and continued after the 1801 formation of the [[United Kingdom]] and intermittently until the middle of the 20th century. The trade was broadly divided into two branches. The northern fishery involved hunting the [[bowhead whale]] off the coast of Greenland and adjacent islands. The southern fishery was activity anywhere else, including in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans and off the Antarctic. The [[Sperm whale]], the [[Southern right whale]] and [[Humpback whale]] were the main target species in South Sea whaling. The industry went on to become a profitable national enterprise and a source of skilled mariners for the Royal Navy in times of war.

[[Whaler#Modern Era|Modern whaling]], using [[factory ship]]s and catchers fitted with [[Harpoon cannon|bow-mounted cannons]] that fired [[explosive harpoon]]s, continued into the 20th century and was mainly focused on the Antarctic and nearby islands, where shore stations had been established. The collapse of whale stocks in the 1960s, due to [[overfishing]], saw Britain abandon the industry after three and a half centuries of involvement.

==History==
{{See also|History of whaling}}
[[Cetacean stranding|Stranded whales]], or [[drift whale]]s that died at sea and washed ashore, provided [[whale meat|meat]], [[blubber]] (rendered into [[whale oil|oil]]) and bone to coastal communities in pre-historic Britain. A 5,000 year old [[whalebone]] figurine was one of the many items found in the Neolithic village of [[Skara Brae]] in Scotland after that stone age settlement was uncovered by a storm in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Metcalfe, “Lost 5,000-year-old Neolithic figure rediscovered in Scotland,” Livescience, June 21, 2016. [https://www.livescience.com/55141-lost-neolithic-figurine-rediscovered-in-scotland.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Whalebone weaving combs from the middle and late Iron Age have been found on archaeological digs in Orkney and Somerset.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Chittock, “Arts and crafts in Iron Age Britain: reconsidering the aesthetic effects of weaving combs,” ''Oxford Journal of Archaeology,'' 33 (3) August 2014, pp.315-6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Cover_of_a_Casket_Carved_in_Whalebone.jpg|thumb|left|The carved lid of a whalebone casket, Northumbria, 8th century, [[British Museum]]]]

A charter granted to [[Hilary of Chichester|Hilary, Bishop of Chichester]] in 1148 gave him the right to “any whale found on the land of the church of Chichester, except the tongue, which is the King's.”&lt;ref&gt;Chesley W. Sanger, “The origins of British whaling; pre-1750 English and Scottish involvement in the northern whale fishery,” ''The Northern Mariner'', 5 (3) July 1995, p.15. [https://www.cnrs-scrn.org/northern_mariner/vol05/tnm_5_3_15-32.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The English king had asserted the right to the entire whale by 1315 when [[Edward III of England|Edward II]] reserved “to himself the right of all whales cast by chance upon the shore.” &lt;ref&gt;Sanger, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Whales came to be known as “Royal fish”, the disposal of which was an exclusive right of the monarch, or his local representative.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, to this day, the [[Crown Estate]] asserts that "theoretically The Queen can claim ownership" of beached whales and other "Royal fish".
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQs|url=https://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/our-business/faqs/#whalecarcassesbeached|website=The Crown Estate|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first tentative involvement in commercial whaling may have occurred in 1576 when a British vessel sailed “to the country called [[Labrador]], which joins [[Newfoundland]], where the Biscay men go in search of whales.”&lt;ref&gt;Hawes, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of Basque whaling|The Basques had whaled]] in the [[Bay of Biscay]] from the twelfth century and by the middle of the sixteenth century were crossing the Atlantic each year to the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland where they established temporary whaling settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|last=Francis|first=Daniel|title=The great chase; a history of world whaling|year=1991|publisher=Penguin|location=Toronto}}, p.9: James A. Tuck &amp; Robert Grenier, ''Red Bay, Labrador: World whaling capital AD 1550-1600,'' Atlantic Archaeology, St Johns, Newfoundland, 1989, pp.43-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustained British interest in the trade began in 1577 when the [[Muscovy Company]] in London was granted a [[State monopoly|Crown monopoly]] to hunt whales “within any seas whatsoever.”&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The northern whale fishery==
A vessel owned by the London-based [[Muscovy Company]] discovered and began to exploit the [[Spitsbergen]] (Svalbard) whaling grounds in 1611.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1617 at least fifteen British vessels were whaling off Spitsbergen each season. Ongoing participation in the fishery proved elusive. It was due, in part, to costly competition between rival chartered companies as they tried to exclude each other, and their foreign rivals, from the region. In the meantime, the Dutch had entered the fishery and soon became dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1660s, there were hundreds of Dutch and German vessels active off Spitsbergen, while in some years not a single British vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Walvisvangst bij de kust van Spitsbergen - Dutch whalers near Spitsbergen (Abraham Storck, 1690).jpg|thumb|''Whaling off the Coast of Spitsbergen'', by Abraham Storck]]

Parliament tried to revive British involvement late in the 17th century. It began with legislation in 1672 that allowed British whaling crews to be composed of up to half foreign nationals, such as the skilled Dutch. The Act also exempted British-caught oil from customs duty, and imposed a £9 a tun duty on oil and £18 on “whale fins” ([[baleen]]) imported from other national fleets.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not till Dutch involvement began to falter in the 1690s, due to political turmoil and warfare in Holland, that the British saw an opportunity, which led to the creation of the Greenland Company.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was unsuccessful and the losses incurred were so large they discouraged further British involvement in the trade till the 1720s, when Henry Elking persuaded the [[South Sea Company]] to try the Spitsbergen fishery.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.40-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Two dozen new vessels were built and equipped and sent forth under the direction of Elking as agent and superintendent for the Greenland Fishery on a salary of £100 a year plus 1.5% of gross sales.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative too was unsuccessful and spelled the end of chartered company involvement in the trade in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliament wanted to revive whaling to reduce the [[trade imbalance]] with Holland and at the same time build up a naval reserve of ships and men that could be easily mobilised in times of war. In 1732 it offered an annual bounty of twenty shillings (one pound sterling) a ton for all whaling vessels over 200 tons fitted out in Great Britain, the relevant legislation coming into force in 1733.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, p.26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The bounty was increased to thirty shillings a ton in 1740, but even then only four or five British vessels sailed north each year. Most of these were owned by merchants who imported whale oil.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Balaena mysticetus.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of an adult Bowhead whale]]

The government increased the bounty to forty shillings a ton in 1750 and this proved the tipping point for a take off in the trade.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; Just two ships were fitted out in 1749, increasing to twenty in 1750, and eighty-three by 1756.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; The forty shillings a ton bounty represented a subsidy of £600 for the average sized 300 ton ship in the trade.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; Also important was a jump in demand for whale oil. [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|The manufacture of woollen textiles]] was increasing and right whale oil was widely used to clean wool before it was spun. The [[Industrial Revolution]] needed lubricants for machinery, and growing urbanization increased the demand for [[oil lamp|lamp fuel]], including in [[Street_light#History|street lighting]]. London was the best lit city in the world, with 5000 street lamps by the 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt; The building industry also used whale oil as an ingredient in paint, varnish and putty. All of this increase in demand led to a rise in price. The average wholesale price was £14 7s a tun early in the 1740s and this rose to £27 a tun in 1754.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Dutch had started to withdraw from the fishery.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.57.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scottish ports were well placed to participate in the growth of the fleet. They were closer to the northern whaling grounds and sent forth more whalers to the Arctic than English outports early in this revival of interest in the trade. Scottish ports involved, in order of importance in the trade, were, [[Leith]], [[Dunbar]], Barrowstoness, [[Dundee]], [[Aberdeen]], [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], [[Glasgow]], [[Anstruther]], [[Greenock]], [[Kirkcaldy]] and [[Alloa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stonehouse |first1=Bernard |title=British Arctic whaling House of Lords records  (dataset) 2014 |url=https://hydra.hull.ac.uk/assets/hull:7139/content02 |publisher=University of Hull |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London remained the single most important port dispatching 71% of British whalers in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.58-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Other English ports involved include [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] (from 1598),&lt;ref&gt;T. Sheppard, "The Hull whaling trade," ''The Mariner's Mirror'', 5 (6) December 1919, p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] (1752),&lt;ref&gt;Tony Barrow, "The Newcastle whaling trade 1752-1849," ''The Mariner's Mirror'', 75 (3) August 1989, p.234.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whitby]] (1753),&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Barrigan, Bernard Stonehouse &amp; Robb Robinson, "A newly discovered Arctic whaling journal," ''The Mariner's Mirror,'' 94 (3) April 2008, p.331.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exeter]] (1754),&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Dixon, "The Exeter Whaling Company," ''The Mariner's Mirror,'' 62 (3) August 1976, p.225.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ipswich]] (1786)&lt;ref&gt;A.G.E.

There were setbacks along the way. These included [[Seven Years' War|war in Europe in 1756]], which saw the crews of some northern whalers depleted by the [[press-gang]]s, regardless of exemptions granted to [[harpoon|harpooners]], line-managers and [[boatsteerer]]s&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; A fall in the price of oil at the same time also impacted the industry and led shipowners to leave the trade. There were eighty-three vessels involved in 1759, and just forty when the war ended in 1763.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; Whaling remained at a low ebb for the next decade with some ports, such as Whitby and Hull, leaving the trade entirely for a time.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers slowly increased till there were fifty vessels involved by 1770.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James H. Wheldon - Whaling Ships Diana and Anne in the Arctic.jpg|thumb|right|"Whaling ships ''Diana'' and ''Anne'' in the Arctic," James H. Wheldon (1830-1895)]]

The [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775-1783) acted as another break on northern whaling. When peace came in 1783 it was followed by an expansion in the British economy and a renewed demand for whale oil.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; America had been a major supplier to Britain, especially of [[sperm whale oil]]. Britain started to participate in the [[sperm whaling|sperm whale fishery]] in 1775 and imposed a heavy duty on oil imported from elsewhere. The high tariff barrier remained after peace was declared and acted as an accelerent to British involvement in South Sea whaling. British activity in the Arctic also began to increase. The number of Greenland whalers rose from 44 in 1782 to 102 in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; The Greenland fishery peaked in 1786-1788 when 250 British vessels were involved with an aggregate tonnage of 73,000 and employing about 10,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; Those vessels came from 23 different ports, with London alone sending 91 vessels, followed by Hull with 36 and Whitby and Newcastle with twenty each.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; The year 1788 was also one of massive loss with the fleet as a whole recording a deficit of £199,371, the London vessels by themselves losing £40,000.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.74.&lt;/ref&gt; Vessels began to leave the trade and by 1790 only eleven ports were still involved.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.86-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Captain John Parker, Whaling Master.jpg|thumb|Right|Captain [[John Parker (whaling master)]] (1803-1867) of Hull.]]

The number of vessels involved in northern whaling slowly picked up as the turn of the century approached, largely unaffected by the French Revolutionary period and Napoleonic Wars.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt; The price of oil and bone was volatile and the latter ranged in price from £400 a ton to just £30 between the 1760s and 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.84.&lt;/ref&gt; Prices began to improve as the new century progressed and the [[Davis Strait]] fishery began develop. The size of the fleet peaked in 1821 after which it began a long slow decline that would last till the end of the century.

[[File:Whitby - Whalebone Arch and View - geograph.org.uk - 679544.jpg|thumb|left|The whalebone arch on the West Cliff at Whitby commemorates the ports historic link with the whaling industry]]

The decline began when the [[Board of Trade]] introduced [[Corn_Laws#Origins|free trade legislation]] that removed the bounty in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.119.&lt;/ref&gt; Also significant was a fall in the price of whale oil to just £18 in 1820-21 season, in response to weak demand caused by a rise in imports of [[seed oil]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; More free trade legislation in 1844 saw the high duty on American-caught whale oil reduced from £27 18s 7d per tun to just £6 6s, and the duty on sperm oil fall to £15 15s.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.121.&lt;/ref&gt; The duty reduction benefited consumers of whale oil but it exposed the whaling industry to the cold winds of competition, and it withered in response.

Poor seasons became more common as whale stocks declined, further hastening the exit from the industry. The vessels still engaged stayed longer on the whaling grounds to achieve better results and in the process were sometimes trapped by the ice. Forced to over-winter, some ships were crushed by the ice and their crewmen had to evacuate the ship. If there was no vessel nearby to take them aboard they would soon freeze to death. Even those taken aboard another vessel faced [[scurvy]] or starvation in crowded unsanitary conditions till the ice began to break up and the vessel could begin the journey home.

[[Sperm oil]] - a valuable commodity worth two or three times more than northern [[right whale]] oil - had been imported from Britain’s [[New England colonies]] till the [[American War of Independence]] curtailed supply. This prompted British entrepreneurs, particularly those who had previously imported the oil, to send their own ships into the South Seas to obtain this high-value commodity. Ten whalers left Britain in 1775, including nine from London, and crossed the equator into the South Atlantic in search of sperm whales.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Richards, ''Into the South Seas; the southern whale fishery comes of age on the Brazil Banks 1765-1812,'' Wellington, New Zealand, The Paremata Press, 1994, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; London alone sent 76 whaling vessels into the south Atlantic between 1776 and 1783. &lt;ref&gt;Richards (1994) p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; British vessels went on to make around 2,500 voyages whaling and sealing voyages to the South Seas between 1775 and 1859.&lt;ref name="britishwhaling1"&gt;http://www.britishwhaling.org/uploads/1/0/9/5/109542063/facts_of_the_british_southern_whale_fishery.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These voyages were made by over 930 vessels owned by 300 principal shipowners.&lt;ref name="britishwhaling1"/&gt; Some of these vessels in the South Atlantic also engaged in clandestine trading on the coast of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (2014) p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; A group of American Quaker whalers, led by William Rotch, senior (1734-1828) of [[Nantucket]], then the hub of the [[whaling in the United States|American whaling industry]], sought to evade British naval blockades of American ports, and the high duty on imported foreign whale oil, by relocating, first to France, and then to Britain. The Rotch family owned at least ten British South Sea whalers between 1775 and 1794.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (2016) p.80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British ships initially “fished” in the mid and south Atlantic, spreading into the Pacific and Indian Oceans in the 1780s. The government bounty of forty shillings a ton paid to northern whalers was extended to the southern fishery in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (2014), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy import duty that applied to oil imported from other countries was not lifted even after hostilities between Britain and America ceased in 1783 and was an additional incentive for shipowners to remain involved in the trade.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (2014) p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The first British whaler to enter the Pacific was the ''Emilia'', owned by [[Samuel Enderby &amp; Sons]] and commanded by Captain James Shields. This vessel sailed from London in September 1788 and fished the Peru Grounds before returning to London in March 1790 with 139 tuns of sperm whale oil.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (2014) p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; 

International conflict became inevitable, spilling over all the continents of the [[New World]]. Spain resented the intrusion of British vessels into the Pacific, especially when they engaged in clandestine trading at [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies in South America]]. In 1789, rising tension over the issue saw Spanish warships, thousands of miles away on the west coast of what is now Canada, seize British vessels engaged in the [[maritime fur trade]] in [[Nootka Sound]] on [[Vancouver Island]]. The resulting [[Nootka Crisis]] was an international incident that brought both nations to the brink of war. War was averted but tensions remained high. Australia was also in their sights. In 1793 a Spanish naval captain with recent knowledge of the area submitted a plan to invade [[New South Wales]], destroy [[Sydney]] and carry away the 7,000 colonists to labour in Spain's own South American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Ean Higgins, "Spanish 'allies' had Sydney in their sights for invasion," ''The Weekend Australian'', 3-4 March 2018, p.8.[https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/spanish-allies-had-sydney-in-their-sights-for-invasion/news-story/51804a08562d1dc057a1f1b73f88ce67]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brookwatson.png|thumb|left|Sir [[Brook Watson]] (1735-1807) was a fourteen-year old apprentice seaman when a shark removed his lower right leg in 1749. He was later a British merchant, owner of South Sea whalers, Lord Mayor of London and member of parliament. He was made a baronet in 1803.]]

British whaling continued in the Pacific, with occasional setbacks along the way. These include the [[Anglo-French War (1778-1783)]], the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1796-1808)]] and the [[War of 1812]] between Britain and the United States. These conflicts forced vessels to travel to and from the whaling grounds in convoys protected by Royal Navy warships. This was not always enough and in 1797 a number of the British whalers were captured when they called at ports on the coast of Chile and Peru for supplies, unaware that war had broken out between Spain and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher G. Maxworthy, “British whalers, merchants and smugglers and contraband trade on the Pacific coast of South America 1783-1810, Derroteros de la Mar del Stir, no.15 (2007) p.78 [https://www.academia.edu/1997971/British_whalers_merchants_and_smugglers_contraband_trade_on_the_Pacific_coast_of_South_America_1783-1810]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[USS Essex (1799)|US warship ''Essex'']] captured a dozen British whalers in the Pacific in 1812, the loss in ships and cargo estimated at $2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Stackpole, p.344 &amp; 350.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as a problem, these conflicts also presented opportunities for British whalers. Many of them sailed for the Pacific with [[Letters of Marque]] obtained from the government, allowing them to attack, capture and plunder enemy-owned trading vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Maxworthy, “Privateering and voyaging from Sydney during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1793-1815),” ''History'' (Magazine of the Royal Australian Historical Society) No. 117, December 2013, pp.16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Britannia whaler.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Whitcombe]], ‘’Departure of the whaler ''Britannia'' from Sydney Cove, 1798’’, National Library of Australia, Canberra.]]

Another significant barrier to expansion were Crown monopolies granted to the [[East India Company]] and the [[South Sea Company]] which restricted British maritime activity in the Pacific and Indian Oceans to ships owned or licensed by the Companies.&lt;ref&gt;J.S. Cumpston, ''Shipping arrivals &amp; departures, Sydney, 1788-1825'', Roebuck, Canberra, 1977, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure exerted by the London whaling lobby saw these restrictions gradually lifted between 1786 and 1813, after which British whalers had unrestricted access to all whaling grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Cumpston, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some whaling shipowners, such as [[Samuel Enderby &amp; Sons]] and [[Mather &amp; Co.]], chartered their vessels to serve as [[convict transport]]s and store ships to the Australian colonies on the outward voyage to the South Seas. Others took with them trade goods they sold in the colonies, or at ports in South America. Contraband trading at South American ports and bays could be lucrative but, if detected by the Spanish colonial authorities, might result in confiscation of the ship and a lengthy period of imprisonment for the crews.&lt;ref&gt;Maxworthy (2007) 77-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years between 1800 and 1809 the British South Sea whaling fleet averaged 72 vessels with 30 ships returning each year. The annual average catch during this period was 1,634 tuns of sperm and 3,300 tuns of southern right whale oil, with an average annual value of £122,000.&lt;ref&gt;Edouard A. Stackpole, ''Whales and Destiny: the rivalry between America, France, and Britain for control of the Southern Whale Fishery, 1785-1825'', University of Massachusetts Press, 1972, p.282.&lt;/ref&gt; British involvement in the South Seas fishery reached its peak, in terms of the number of vessels involved, in the years between 1820 and 1822.&lt;ref&gt;A.G.E. Jones, ''Ships employed in the South Seas trade 1775-1861'', Roebuck, Canberra, 1986, p.258.&lt;/ref&gt; The end of subsidy payments in 1824 played a part in the decline, as did the reduction in the duty on imported foreign-caught oil in 1843, and its total abolition in 1849. A decline in whale stocks was also a significant factor and caused a steady increase in the length of voyages.&lt;ref&gt;Dale Chatwin, "Findings from an analysis of data in the British Southern Whale Fishery (1775-1859) datasets," ''The Great Circle'' 40 (2) November 2018, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1843, only 36 vessels were still involved in the trade, and just 20 by 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Clayton, “The development of a Southern Whale Fishery from Britain between 1775 and 1815,” PhD thesis, University of Wales, Swansea, 2002. P.99.&lt;/ref&gt; The last British vessel involved in South Sea whaling in the [[Age of Sail]] was the ''Cowlitz'' (Captain Bushell) which returned to London in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p.180.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the Enderby family, other prominent shipowners in the southern whale fishery included Daniel Bennett, [[Alexander Champion (businessman)|Alexander Champion]], [[John St Barbe]] and [[Thomas Sturge]].

==Modern whaling==
The development of [[harpoon]]s went hand in hand with the development of commercial whaling. Harpoon guns were trialed by the [[South Sea Company]] in 1737 and hand-held guns that discharged rocket harpoons were in general use by American and other national whalers in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;J.N. Tonnessen &amp; A.O. Johnsen, ''The history of modern whaling'', C. Hurst &amp; Company and Australian National University Press, London &amp; Canberra, 1982, p.17-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Further experimentation at that period by [[Svend Foyn]] at Tonsberg in Norway resulted in a safer and more efficient [[harpoon cannon]] that was patented in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Tonnessen &amp; Johnsen, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; These cannon were mounted on the bow of steam-powered metal-hulled catchers and allowed faster whale species to be hunted. The introduction of [[factory ship]]s that could winch the captured whales up a stern ramp and onto the deck meant further advances in efficiency and safety for those employed in the industry.[[File:Dundee Antarctic Whaling Expedition 1892.jpg|thumb|260px|The Dundee Antarctic Whaling Expedition by [[William Gordon Burn Murdoch]].]]

Modern whaling in Britain can be dated from 1904, when Norwegian expatriate [[Christian Salvesen]] at [[Leith]] in Scotland established the Olna Whaling Company.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt; Shore-based [[whaling station]]s established at Olna Firth and elsewhere in Scotland were highly productive, taking 2,418 fin and 1,283 sei whales between 1908 and 1914, inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt; After the oil was extracted, the meat and bone was ground into a meal used as an animal food supplement. Salvesen later established other stations at Thorvig in the [[Faroe Islands]] and at Hellisford in [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; Modern whaling methods soon depleted whaling stocks in European waters and companies began to look further afield. The [[Dundee whaling expedition]] set out from Scotland and ventured to the Antarctic in 1892-93 to look for whaling grounds that might be worth fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.171; Tonnessen &amp; Johnsen, p.150-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern shore-based whaling station in the southern hemisphere was established at [[Grytviken]] on [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] by an Argentine compnany in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Tonnessen &amp; Johnsen, p.172.&lt;/ref&gt; There were nineteen whaling firms in the region by 1914, most of them owned or staffed by Norwegians.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.172.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Salvesen established a new whaling company in 1908 which began operations at [[West Falkland]] in January 1909 and later in the year at South Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.173.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter operation was based at Leith Harbour and it continued to function till the 1960s. The official language there was Norwegian, indicating the main source of labour.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; A second British firm, the [[Southern Whaling and Sealing Company]] of North Shields, was established in 1911 to operate at [[Prince Olav Harbour]] on South Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.173.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Harpoon cannon-IMG 3915.jpg|thumb|left|Harpoon cannon outside the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]], Cambridge.]]

Old [[merchant vessel]]s of 2000-3000 tons were brought into service as rudimentary factory ships by the Norwegians in 1905, and by the British in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.175.&lt;/ref&gt; These vessels allowed the whole whale to be processed with less waste. The start of [[World War I]] led to an increased demand for whaling products, and catches by the two British firms in the Antarctic increased in response. Advances in [[hydrogenation]] allowed the oil from [[baleen whale]]s to be hardened to make [[margarine]], a substitute for butter, in short supply due to the war. The hardened whale oil was also used to make soap, with [[Lever Brothers]] the major user of whale oil in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.184.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major event in the post-war years was the purchase of the Southern Whaling Company by Lever Brothers for £360,000 in September 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Whaling and Sealing Company and Christian Salvesen were the two main producers of whale oil from shore-based whaling stations and floating factory ships in the Antarctic in the early 1920s. Other significant developments were the introduction of larger catchers, that could range further, and a switch in target species from [[fin whale]]s to [[blue whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.194.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carl-Anton-Larsen.jpg|thumb|right|Captain [[Carl Anton Larsen]] (1860-1924).]]

The depletion of South Georgia waters by the 1920s saw British companies invest in new factory ships that could be sent to whaling grounds further afield during the brief three month long Antarctic whaling season. The waters around the [[South Shetland Islands]] and [[South Orkney Islands]] were tried but the major development in the 1920s was the discovery by the Norwegian, Captain [[Carl Anton Larsen]] in the 1923-24 season, of a passage through the pack ice to the ice-free waters of the [[Ross Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Tonnessen &amp; Johnsen, p.346.&lt;/ref&gt; The difficult conditions in the Ross Sea called for larger factory ships and more powerful catchers. Christian Salvesen took delivery of six new catchers in 1924, the first of forty catchers commissioned and built at [[Middlesbrough]] for them during the inter-war years.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.195.&lt;/ref&gt; The profits in the industry saw the creation of a third British firm in 1928, the Hector Whaling Company, with a nominal capital of £250,000.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.201&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FMIB 35789 Modern Whaling Cannon Loaded with Harpoon, and Ready to Fire.jpeg|thumb|left|Modern whaling cannon loaded with a harpoon and ready to fire, J.T. Jenkins]]

An increase in the number of factory ships from 17 to 41, most of them deployed to the Ross Sea, saw total world whale oil production explode from 145,394 tons in 1926-27 to 601,392 tons in the 1930-31 season, while the British component went from 61,781 tons to 120,533 tons during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.204.&lt;/ref&gt; This massive oversupply led to a rise in inventories and a fall in price and a decision by the Norwegians to keep their vessels in port in the 1931-32 season. British producers responded by closing two unprofitable shore-based stations in Scotland and another in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.209-211&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued [[overfishing]] and the resulting depletion of whale stocks in the Antarctic turned thoughts to greater regulation and how the industry might be made sustainable. Efforts were made to further limit the length of the whaling season and quotas were introduced on the number of whales that could be taken.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.218.&lt;/ref&gt; More effective in limiting the catch was the ongoing surplus of oil in storage and the resulting low price that restricted the number of factory ships at sea. This continued till 1935 when a rise in the price of oil saw an increase in the number of factory ships to sail. Some of these "fished" the whaling grounds off Western Australia, Peru and Madagascar. The old cycle was repeated again with overproduction and a crash in the oil price.

The oil surplus of the 1935-36 season was the result of good weather in the Antarctic and the activity of new whaling factories and catchers, including some from Japan, Germany and Denmark, new entrants into modern whaling. It also reflected the creation of a number of new small whaling companies in Britain in the 1930s. These included Anglo-Norse Ltd, Polar Whaling Company and Star Whaling.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.227&lt;/ref&gt; There were still nine British shore-based whaling stations operating in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.228.&lt;/ref&gt; To maintain production levels, the target species broadened, with fin, humpback and sperm whales taken in increasing numbers. Even so, on the eve of world war in 1939 the industry was facing difficult times with declining whale stocks, rising costs and falling demand as manufacturers switched to whale oil substitutes, such as palm oil.

The [[Second World War]] devastated the whaling industry. The European market for British-caught oil disappeared almost overnight. Whale catchers and factory ships were requisitioned for military purposes and a number were sunk by enemy action. Whale stocks recovered slightly but when the Second World War ended, the war on the whales began again.

[[File:FLK Balaena - Husvik 1949-05-01.jpg|thumb|right|The British whaling factory ship ''Balaena'', May 1949, was operated by the Hector Whaling Company.]]

An urgent need for [[edible oil]]s of all kinds in the post-war period saw the price of whale oil reach £100 a ton on several occasions between 1945 and 1952 and prompted a resurgence in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the vessels sent south had been seized from Germany as enemy property while other factories and catchers were newly built. British companies produced 39,708 tons of oil in the 1945-46 season, rising to 89,012 tons in 1948-49.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.237.&lt;/ref&gt; The renewed activity by British, Norwegian and other producers postponed any plans for regulations to limit the number of whales taken and make the industry sustainable.

The [[International Whaling Commission]] reduced the length of the whaling season in the late 1940s, and also introduced catch limits. The quotas were set too high and, in any case, were ignored by some operators. Attempts were made to expand the market for whale meat in Britain by marketing it for human consumption, but were unsuccessful. After the oil was extracted most of the residue continued to be processed into low-value meat meal to feed livestock.

The value of whale oil peaked in 1950-1952 in anticipation of strong demand during the [[Korean War]], and then began to decline. The British share of the catch fell after 1954 and companies based in the United Kingdom started to think about how to exit the industry. Hector Whaling did so in 1960 and Salvesen in 1963, bringing to an end three and a half centuries of British involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.246-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Whaling product imports were banned in Britain in 1973. &lt;ref&gt;"Whale imports banned," ''Nature'' (London) 242 (5395) 23 March 1973, p.220.&lt;/ref&gt; A massive decline in whale numbers had made the industry uneconomic and the International Whaling Commission introduced a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on commercial whaling in 1982. Britain was one of 25 members of the Commission to successfully approve the moratorium, which went into effect in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/24/us/commission-votes-to-ban-hunting-of-whales.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3905487.stm&lt;/ref&gt;
